MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TftE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BOLIVIA
FOR AN
AGRO-EXPORT DEVEL.OPMENT PROGRAM (AEDP)
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed credit to
the Republic of Bolivia for SDR 16.6 million (US$22.5 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit, which would be repayable in 40
years, including 10 years of grace, at standard IDA terms, would help to
finance an Agro-Export Development Program (AEDP) for Bolivia.  The Government
of the Netherlands (GOB) would cofinance the AEDP through a grant of
US$9.0 million equivalent.
2.        Background.  During the early 1980s, Bolivia experienced rapidly
deteriorating economic conditions, political instability, accumulation of an
unsustainable debt burden, and severe macroeconomic mismanagement leading to a
crisis with hyperinflation in mid-1985. In order to restore control of the
economy, a radical stabilization program was adopted, including massive
devaluation of the exchange rate, increases in public sector prices, and
reductions in Government expenditures to levels financeable by available
funds. The adjustment program was highly successful in stabilizing the
economy and in reducing internal and external imbalances. For the first time
in nearly a decade the economy attained a positive GDP growth rate of 2.6Z in
1987. Prudent macroeconomic management permitted the recovery to be sustained
with steady GD? growth of 2.7S on average through 1990, expected to reach over
42 for 1991. The Government strategy for sustained economic growth is based
on maintenance of stable macroeconomic policy; private sector investments in
the productive sectors; a shift in the role of the Government to focus its
investments on provision of physical infrastructure (e.g. roads, water) and
social infrastructure (e.g. education, primary health care); and improving the
capacity and the efficiency of public administration. A structural adjustment
credit of SDR 30.0 million (US$40.0 million equivalent) was approved by the
Board on September 16, 1991 to assist the Government to divest its assets in
the productive and banking sectors, and to strengthen financial markets. The
new investment, hydrocarbons and mining laws, enacted in 1990/91 have
encouraged new private investments in two of the three major growth sectors in
Bolivia--the mining and hydrocarbons sectors. The third area of potential
growth is agriculture, where significant growth has been recorded over the
past few years, but which requires greater investment activity by local
entrepreneurs and foreign investors.  The proposed Agro-Export Development
Program (AEDP), which would be implemented by an autonomous, private self-
financing foundation, the Bolivia Export Foundation (BEF), would help to
develop the financial and technical mechanisms through which small- and
medium-scale farmers, and entrepreneurs can be encouraged and supported to
expand production and agroindustrial exports.
3.        Agriculture is the most important sector in Bolivia, accounting for
about 21% of total GDP in 1989, up from about 18% in 1978, and about 40% of
total employment. At about US$111.8 million in 1988, agricultural exports
represented about 19% of Bolivia's total legal exports. This almost doubled



in 1989 to US$208 million, representing '5.5% of total legal exporos. Apart
from hydrocarbons, agriculture provides the most likely source of export
expansion and income growth over the medium term. Traditionally, five
producto (coffee, wood and wood products, sugar and leather) have accounted
for the bulk of agricultural exports. In 1980, ;his group accounted for 712
of agricultural exports, but their share dropped to about 452 in 1989 as
exports of soya and derivatives have grown from US$7 million in 1980 to US$52
million in 1989 (25S of total agricultural exports). Other products with
growing markets have been Brazil nuts, which rose from about US$3 million in
1980 to around US$10 million in 1989, and angora wool exports, which increased
from US$0.1 million to US$0.4 million between 1987 and 1989. Cochineal and
carmine exports were US$0.2 million during 1988-89; and flower exports rose
from US$0.04 million in 1987 to over US$0.5 million in 1989. Studies
commissioned in 1986/87 indicate that the most promising exports are wood
products, livestock, soybeans, coffee, Brazil nuts, flowers, alpaca/llama,
leather, and silk. However, the lack of private sector investment is
constraining the full development of this potential.
.         Rationale for IDA Participation.  IA's participation in the
proposed AEDP would support private sector expansion in the agricultural
sector, initially focussing on four products identified during project
preparation, with small but established markets abroad. IDA's effort is part
of a broader strategy to help accelerate economic growth by diversifying
productive activity. IDA has played a leading role in coneeptualizing and
designing the AEDP, including the establishment of the BEF, and the
mobilization of financing irom GON for preparing and implementing the AEDP.
Through its participation IDA would help the BEF to serve as a development
mechanism to bridge the transition from public to private sector
responsibility for development of the agricultural sector, particularly
agroindustrial development focusing on high value agricultural products and
small farmers participation. This is an essential function since the evolving
finaxcial sector in Bolivia is not yet in a position to provide the full range
of se-vices needed to establish and expand new agroindustrial activities.
Also, through IDA participation, safeguards have been incorporated in the
first five potential enterprises to protect the environment, especially in the
Bolivian Amazonia and in the Department of Cochabamba, and to enhance the
employment opportunities of rural women.
5.        Proiect Obiectives. The proposed AEDP would establish a mechanism
to help Bolivian farmers and entrepreneurs produce and export quality
agricultural products. The project aims to: (a) develop the capacity of the
newly established BEF as a private, autonomous, .elf-financing organization,
to establish financially sound, agro-based subsidiaries and joint ventures
with small- and medium-scale entrepreneurs and investors; (b) introduce
improved technology to expand agricultural production, in an environmentally
sound manner; and (c) generate employment and capitpl accumulation in order to
improve the incomes and standard of living of poor farmers, women's groups,
urban and rural laborers.
6.        Detailed Proiect Description.  The AEDP would finance three main
components: (a) the operations of the BEF, including its enterprise



investment program, which initially is expected to consist of five joint
ventures and subsidiaries; (b) the employment of a management firm to provide
four experts for the BEE; and (c) the provision by the BEE of technical
assistance for carrying out, market research and feasibility studies for
identifying new investment opportunities for export of additional agricultural
products from Bolivia. Details are given below.
7.        The Bolivia Export Foundation (BEF).  The BEY, as the executing
agency, is the heart of AEDP. The BEP was established by Supreme Resolution
on September 20, 1991 as a private, self-financiag, autonomous entity with its
own independent Board of Directors, capital and management team. BEF is
modeled on Fundaci6n Chile (CF), an autonomous agency jointly established
through a grant of US$50.0 million equivalent by the Government of Chile and
an American multinational firm in 1976. CF has been successful in
establishing financially viable joint ventures and subsidiaries, and in
subsequently selling them to private investors. Like CF, BE! was created to
give Bolivia the long-term institutional capability for vertically integrating
the essential activities required to produce and export agricultural products
competitively.
8.        Establishment of BEF as a Foundation instead of as a private
corporation provides the most appropriate mechanism under Bolivian conditions
for both mobilizing and channeling donor, Government and multilateral
resources for supporting directly private sector investments. To this end,
BEF would act as a one-stop equity financing and technical assistance service
cente. forming joint ventures with private producers, investors and exporters.
BEF would carefully prescreen potential investors, products, technologies and
markets, and carry out feasibility studies before investing its resources. In
keeping with its development role, and not to compete with other private
sector initiatives, BEF would seek to divest its shares in any enterprise
within .ive years of full commercial production. It would use its revenues
from sales of enterprises, fees and dividends to pay for its overhead costs,
repay loans and to invest in additional enterprises. Although BEF-supported
enterprises would pay dividends to their shareholders, the BEF as a
foundation, cannot pay dividends. Therefore, while private investors would
not participate in BEP itself, IPC and foreign investors could participate in
BEF's joint ventures and be paid dividends earned by those ventures.
9.        Enterprise Investment Program.  Four products were 4dentified
during preparation of the AIDP. Feasibility studies were completed to detail
the levels of investment needed, to identify markets abroad, and to develop
the legal structure for setting up, initially, five joint ventures and
subsidiaries for producing and exporting these products. The same feasibility
studies were also used to dimension the project's scope and content, the
organizational setup, and the environmental safeguards.  The four products
(angora wool, cochineal, flowers and Brazil nuts) are considered good
prospects for expanding exports rapidly.
10.       Four products would be produced and exported by the following joint
ventures and subsidiaries to be financed by BEF: (a) ANGOBOL (Bolivian Angora



- 4 -
Ltd.) would be established initially as a subsidiary of BEF for the purpose of
producing and exporting high quality angora hair. ANGOBOL would finance the
construction of commercial production, service and administration centers, as
well as the cost of on-farm production. Total cost for ANGOBOL including that
of the management of the enterprise is estimated at US$5.8 million, of which
US$0.8 million would be contributed by beneficiaries over five years; (b)
EMPROCC (The Lnterprise to Process Cochineal '/ would be established
initially as a subsidiary of BE?. EWPROCC would produce cochirseal in its own
oroduction sheds and it would also purchase cochineal from small farmers. The
export of dried cochineal and carmine would be done by the marketing division
of BEF. Total cost for establishing E1MPROCC and the processing plant is
estimated at US$3.9 million of which US$0.1 million would be contributed by
the beneficiaries over five years; (c) FINFLOR (Flowers Financing Ltd.) would
be established initially as a subsidiary of BEF and it would enter into joint
ventures with about 8 to 12 flower producers to expand production and export
of quality flowers. The estimated total cost for establishing FINFLOR and its
joint ventures would be US$10.3 million, of which flower growers would
contribute US$1.7 million cver five years; (d) EMCASCA (Brazil Nut Compary)
world be established by BEF and the Federation of Peasants in Riberalta (the
Beni Department) to finance construction of a new Brazil nut cracking plant,
storage facilities and clearance of narrow access footpaths. The total cost
of this investment is estimated at US$2.0 million of which US$0.1 million
would be contributed by the beneficiarles over five years; and (e) BEF would
form a joint venture with Vaca Diaz Foundation (VDF) to finance rehabilitation
of a second cracking plant also in Riberalta. The total cost of the
investment and related activities would ba US$0.6 million. Additionally, VDF
would manage an agro-forestry program to introdvce alternative farming systems
to the slash-snd-burn now practiced in the Amazonia region of Bolivia. US$2.6
million has been tentatively allocated to support the Brazil nut agro-forestry
program and GOB has agreed to approach donors for additional funding should
the environmental assessment and related studies, now underway with financing
from the GON, recommend initiation of a much larger agro-forestry project than
is programmed.
11.       The Manaaement Team.  The second component of AEDP would finance
the hiring of an international management firm to help the BEF form and manage
its enterprises while concurrently training Bolivian counterpart staff to take
over the management of BEF at the end of five years. BEF's Annual Business
Plan (ABP) would contain a specific training program and action plan for this
purpose.  The contract with the firm would stipulate that it would provide
four highly qualified professionals who, among them, would bring
administrative and financial management expertise to BEF as well as experience
in agricultural production and export. The total estimated cost of this
component, including administration and fees for Board of Directors is
US$5.5 million.
1J An insect parasite of the prickly pear cactus containing carminic
acid which is an organic red coloring agent used in the food and
cosmetic industries.



12.       Productllarket Research and Development.  The third component would
finance technical assistance for production, marketing research and
feasibility studies for developing new products, as well as technical and
management consultancy services to improve performance of existing
enterprises. During the preparation, additional products such as leather,
llama/alpaca, wool, silkg quinoa, potpourri, natural sweeteners (Stevia
Rebaudiana), have been identified for further research and development under
this component. The total estimated cost of this component would be
US$5.4 million.
13.       Project Coats and Financing.  The total project cost is estimated
at US$39.7 million with a foreign exceange component of US$28.8 million (722).
Price contingencies total US$4.6 million (13X). The proposed IDA credit of
US$22.5 million would finance 572 of total project costs, equivalent to 722 of
the project's incremental foreign exchange costs, and 202 of local costs. The
balance would be financed as followss US$2.7 million equivalent from the
beneficiaries of the enterprises; US$4.1 million equivalent from GOB
(US$0.5 million as a loan denominated in dollars carrying interest at a rate
equivalent to either 8S or LIBOR plus two percentage points, whichever is
greater, and deferral of payments on the onlent IDA funds amounting to
US$3.6 million (representing interest during implementation of the initial
investments), US$9.0 million equivalent as a grant from GON; and US$1.4
million equivalent from service fees to be charged by BEF for technical and
management consultancy services rendered. IDA's credit to the GOB would be
passed on to the BEF as follows: (a) US$13.2 million as a grant to finance
costs, not directly associated with the investments in joint ventures and
subsidiaries; and (b) US$9.3 million as a loan denominated in dollars over
25 years (5 years grace), (interest accrued in Years 1 through 5 would be
repaid over Years 6 through 25), cariying interest at a rate equal to either
eight percent (8Z) or LIBOR plus two percentage points, whichever is greater
for the investment side of BEF's operations. These terms and conditions are
covmensurate both with the income projections and financial capacity of BEF to
secure this debt and provide investment capital to set up the first five
enterprises. IDA would disburse 702 against eligible expenditures, and it
would administer GOB's funds which would be disbursed jointly at a ratio of
30s70. A breakdown of costs and a financing plan is shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement, together with the disbursement schedule,
is shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank/IDA Group operations in Bolivia are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is attached, along with the Staff Appraisal Report No.
9633-BO dated November 26, 1991.
14.        The Implementation of AEDP.  The AEDP would be implemented by BEE
with the support of the management firm. The By-Laws of the BEF provide for a
Board of a minimum of six and a maximum of 12 members and their alternates.
Presently the Board, appointed in June 1991, consists of six directors and
their alternates composed of four prominent Bolivian businessmen active in the
private sector, one of whom is the President of the Board, and one
representative each from the GOB and GON. Each director has one vote. The
general manager, who initially would be contracted through a management firm,
would seek BEF's Board approval for all investment proposals. All the



- 6 -
feasibility studies, environmental assessments, and the legal instruments
required for establishing enterprises would be subject to IDA's approval and
be in accordance with criteria opelled out in BE!'s Operational Manual (OM),
which also spells out its operational and financial policies. BEF's Board of
Directors is expected to complete its review in early 1992 of all the
feasibility studies and its consultation with private investors and potential
benefic.iaries of the AEDP regarding the initial five enterprises. Soon
thereafter, BEF could present for IDA's approval the first year ABP for
initiation of investments. Each of the enterprises to be financed by BEP
sould have it own Board and management team.  Each would submit annually its
expenditure proposals, backed up with detailed feasibility studiest for BEF's
approval. BEF would consolidate and prepari the ABP for review by its Board
and submission to IDA by November 30 of each year. Implementation of the AEDP
would be monitored regularly. Independent consultants would carry out, on the
basis of terms of reference satisfactory to IDA, a mid-term assessment of
AEDP's performance after 2-1/2 years from the date of effectiveness of IDA's
credit.
15.       Actions Agreed.  (a) BEE's debt to equity ratio would not exceed
70:30 unless otherwise agreed by IDA; (b) GOB and BEF would use their best
endeavors to improve the socioeconomic conditions of farmers' families and
laborers associated with investment enterprises satisfactory to IDA, and GOB
shall ensure that BEF shall carry out environmental assessments and studies,
satisfactory to IDA for any investments; (c) BEF's Board would, within three
months after effectiveness, submit the first ABP, and thereafter submit such
by November 30 of each yaar; (d) the Ministry of Planning and Coordination
would ensure that any other public financed projects to support exports would
be compatible in their technical and quality aspects as well as terms and
conditions with the AEDP; (e) GOB would ensure that donor support for agro-
export projects would contain measures to mitigate against adverse effects
from exports on small-scale local entrepreneurs; (f) the Ministry of Industry,
Commerce and Tourism would permit exporters participating in AMDP to follow
expeditious procedures, satisfactory to IDA; (g) the accounts of each
enterprise along with the Special Account, Statements of Expenditures, and
BEF's consolidated accounts would be audited annually by independent auditors,
satisfactory to IDA; the latter three audit reports to be submitted to IDA
within six months after the end of each fiscal year; (h) BEF would retain a
qualified management firm for the duration of the project which, inter alia,
would train Bolivian counterparts to take over management in the fifth year of
the project; (i) BEF would operate in accordance with procedures agreed with
IDA as contained in the OK, which can not be modified without IDA's prior
approval; (' REP's Board of Directors Selection Committee would, as needed,
appoint new directors with skills, experience and qualifications specified in
the By-Laws, satisfactory to IDA; (k) BEF would put the monitoring system into
operation within six months from the date of effectiveness; (1) BEF would hire
independent consultants, satisfactory to IDA, to carry out a mid-term
assessment of BE!'s overall performance by no later than 2-1/2 years after
loan effectiveness; the consultant's report on BE!'s performance, together
with an action program would be submitted to IDA within three months of the
commencement of the mid-term review; (i) BEY would provide a brief progress
report about the AEDP to IDA by June 30 and December 31 of each year; (n) BEF



shall not lend any funds or provide guarantees for third parties without IDA's
or GOB's prior approvall (o) BEY would submit a Project Completion Report
vithin six months of the Closing Date; and (p) BEF shall have established at
least three enterprises by the time of the mid-term review, urles& otherwise
agreed with IDA.  Coditigons of Jffectivenes_s  (a) financing arravgements
between GOB and GON had been entered into; (b) GOB had satisfactorily entered
into a subsidiary agreement with BEF for transfer of the proceeds of IDA
%-redit; (a) BEF's Board had signed a contract with a management firm for three
years renegotiable for two additional years, satisfactory to IDA and the
general manager of the management fiTm had taken up his/her position in
Bolivia; and (d) the ON, satisfactory to IDA, had been officially adopted by
BEY's Board, such ON to require, inter alia, that all procurement and the
hiring of consultants be in accordance with Bank Guidelines. ConditiOju of
Disbursement for Each Enterprise: No disbursement would be made in resard to
any joint venture or subsidiary of BEF until evidence satisfactory to IDA has
been provided on the legal establishment of such enterprise (legal opinion).
16.       Bepefits and Risks.  The financial and economic rates of return for
AEDP, based on expected benefits from the five investments already identified,
have been estimated at 202 and 272, respectively.  Most of AEDP's direct
and/or indirect beneficiaries would be small farmers and small- to modium-
scale entrepreneurs to be involved in td. first five enterprises. Some 4,iOO
permanent jobs are expected to be created, of which an estimated 1,000 wou;..
be for women. The AEDP would substantially increase foreign exchsnge earnings
and provide a self-sustaining mechanism capable of identifying and
establishing viable new agricultural enterprises.
17.       One of the risks is that BEF may fail to establish and manage
profitably export-oriented enterprises within the projected time frame. This
could happen if the macroeconomic performance and business environment in
Bolivia or in international markets were to deteriorate. On the Government's
part, it continues to deepen its program of economic adjustment. On BEF's
part, its diversified export portfolio should minimize this risk. The AEDP
includes safeguards to reduce operational risks related to the implementation
of the pro!ect which inter alia include: (a) consultation between IDA and
BEP's Board regarding action on the feasibility studies and BEF's work program
through the preparation of the Annual Business Plan; (b) strong representation
on BEF's Board of Directors of prominent local businessmen and donors to
ensure business-like orientation for BEF; (c) the selection of a highly
experienced international management firm to ensure that BEF would be managed
efficiently; (d) comprehensive criteria agreed with IDA for appraising,
*        evaluating and implementing investments, including prior approval by IDA of
each feasibility study covering economic, financial, technical and social
aspects of each investment; and (e) close supervision and monitoring of BEF's
operations, including a mid-term performance assessment linked to a monitoring
and evaluation system. The mid-term review would identify the problems and
make it possible to take remedial actions as necessary, at the early steges of
implementation. An event of default under the credit would occur if the BE?
is unable to establish at least three enterprises by the time of the mid-term
review, unless otherwise agreed with IDA.



18.       Recomme dation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit will
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
