IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
BOLIVIA
AGRO-EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Cr. 2322-BO
Preface
1.    This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Agro-Export
Development Project in Bolivia, for which Credit 2322-BO in the amount of
SDR 16.6 million (US$22.5 million equivalent) was signed on March 4, 1992 and made
effective on November 9, 1992. The project was co-financed by the Government of the
Netherlands for 16.4 million guilders (US$8.9 million equivalent) and by the Government
of the Swiss Federation for 4.5 million Swiss Francs (US$3.2 million equivalent).
2.    The credit was closed on December 31, 1997. The final disbursement took place
on February 19, 1998. The balance of US$7 million was canceled.
3.    The ICR was prepared by Mr. Pierre Werbrouck (Sr. Agricultural Economist) and
Mr. Michel Buyckx (Private Sector Specialist-Consultant), Environmentally and Socially
Sustainable Development Sector Unit, Latin American and the Caribbean Region. The
ICR was reviewed by Ms. Deborah Bateman (Bolivia - Resident Representative) and
Mr. Jonathan Parker (LCC4C). The ICR was forwarded to the co-financiers who
commented on the report: The Royal Dutch Embassy in La Paz, Bolivia and COSUDE
(Swiss Federation), La Paz, Bolivia. The Borrower provided comments included as
Appendix B to the ICR.
4.    Preparation of the ICR started during the Bank's completion mission in February
1998. It is based on materials in the project file and interviews with local stakeholders,
including representatives of the co-financiers, members of BEF's Board of Directors and
managers of investment enterprises. The Borrower contributed to the preparation of the
ICR by providing opinions reflected in the mission's Aide Memoire attached as
Appendix A and the project final report, the executive summary of which is attached as
Appendix C.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
AGRO-EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Cr. 2322-BO)
BOLIVIA
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    The project evolved out of the Agricultural Development Project financed by the
Dutch Government. The Bolivia Export Foundation (BEF) was created in September
1991. The project involved financing by two donors: IDA (16.6 million SDRs or
US$ 22.5 million) and the Netherlands (16.4 million guilders or US$8.9 million
equivalent). An amount of 8.2 million SDRs were considered as a grant to BEF and
8.4 million SDRs as a loan from the Government to BEF and to be reimbursed over a
period of 25 years at a rate of 7 percent per annum. The project became effective on
November 9, I1992. The Government of the Swiss Federation entered in co-financing in
December 1993 for an amount of 4.5 million Swiss Francs (US$3.2 million equivalent).
In total, BEF disposed of about US$35 million dollars to implement the Agro-Export
Development Project (AEDP). The project was closed on December 31, 1997. An
amount of US$7 million was canceled.
A. Project Objectives
2.    The Agro-Export Development Project's objectives were to: (i) expand
production and improve quality and price competitiveness of agricultural goods for
exports; (ii) create institutional capacity to help entrepreneurs and investors selected by
BEF develop agro-based export/import enterprises; (iii) identify and import technology to
assist such entrepreneurs and investors to further develop their production and export
capacity; (iv) increase market opportunities for the exportation of agro-industrial
products; and (v) create employment and generate capital accumulation in order to
improve the incomes and standards of living of farmers, women's groups and urban and
rural laborers by expanding and developing new agricultural and agro-processing
enterprises.
3.    Comments on Project Objectives. The project objectives as stated in the Credit
Agreement are a mixture of development objectives (production expansion, increase in
living standards), project outputs (institutional capacity) and activities (import of
technology, creation of enterprises). There was no ranking of the objectives. The project
objectives as stated in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) put more emphasis on the
creation of institutional capacity which would sustain the operation. The timetable to
reach most objectives was too short.



ii
B. Implementation Experience and Results
4.    The results of the Project are evaluated as unsatisfactory. BEF has developed into
an organization, independent from Government, capable of monitoring the investrnent
portfolio and re-invest the funds. The cost, however, has been very high. The total
management and operating costs over the project period amount to US$5.5 million and
after an investment of US$19.6 million, BEF owns a portfolio with a market value
estimated between US$8 to 12 million only. Since most investments are very new, the
portfolio value, however, may grow.
5.    Key factors that affected the performance of the Project were: (i) nearly two years
were lost in the beginning of the project because of a poor performing international
management team and poor monitoring by the Bank; and (ii) BEF never had a
sufficiently qualified management team to avoid erroneous investments and to monitor its
portfolio.
C. Summary of Findings
Sustainability
6.    Sustainability is likely. There remain some risks inherent to the value of the
future portfolio and the process of desinvestment. At present, the portfolio value is
sufficient to reimburse the government loan and for continuous re-investment. Co-
operation with the private sector should be sought to ensure that BEF keeps on playing a
role in agro-business development.
Bank and Borrower Performance
7.    Overall Bank performance is rated as unsatisfactory, for'the following reasons.
The project design lacked prioritization of project objectives and was wrong in proposing
to start up five new companies from scratch. The SAR had no clear project output and
impact monitoring indicators. People involved in the project preparation and supervision
had a professional profile typical for donor-based operations, while the project was pure
business and needed experienced business people. And during the first two years of the
Project, the Bank was not decisive enough to speed up the project-startup and limit the
operational costs.
8.    The Borrower performance is satisfactory. The Government has respected the
independent structure of BEF. The performance of the management team is marginally
satisfactory and has improved over the last years. The teamn has now the capacity to
follow-up the portfolio and to re-invest the funds, but it did not perform well enough to
avoid financial losses and over-evaluations of some investments. The performance of the
Board of Directors is rated as satisfactory but it decision-making has been slow.



iii
D. Future Operations
9.    The Bank and other donors should keep a link with BEF in order to secure BEF's
independence and image and to assist with some punctual advice when important
business decisions will have to be taken. Such an intervention could be very cost-
effective compared to the funds invested in BEF.
E. Key Lessons Learned
10.   Bureaucrats should stay out of business. The principal lesson that can be
drawn from project implementation is that top entrepreneurial management is necessary
to invest and monitor the use of such a large portfolio. A business operation managed by
people with a public service or development aid profile is likely to underperform.
11.   Business strategy. The three following lessons are less important during startup
but eventually decisive for the success of BEF:
(i)  Step by step investments: each company has its own development capacity
and over-capitalization can be as disastrous as lack of capital. Especially in
case of less experienced enterprises, it is important to limit the risk of failure,
invest step by step and allow for increasing knowledge and market build-up;
(ii)  BEF should avoid creating new companies from scratch, unless it concerns
smaller enterprises were no alternatives are available and/or other criteria,
like social impact, are principal; and
(iii)  When investing in companies, BEF should introduce immediately own
mnanagement and accounting procedures, allowing it to monitor the
company's performance on a daily basis.
12.   Need for a competent local partner. The combination of local business
relations, understanding of the local business realities and private money (the business
drive) could have been obtained by including from the beginning a local private financial
institution as partner in BEF.
13.   Legal framework. In a legal framework where contracts can not be enforced
through courts, formal business is hard to carry out. Companies in Bolivia are mainly
family businesses that enforce contracts by using multiple compliance strategies (through
family relations and other business ties). An organization such as BEF does not have this
type of informal relationships and has difficulty working in such environment.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
AGRO-EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Cr. 2322-BO)
BOLIVIA
Introduction
1     The Bolivian Export Foundation (BEF) and the Agro-Export Development
Program (AEDP) were created out of the Agricultural Development Project (ADP)
financed by the Dutch Government (1987-91). ADP evaluated the production and export
potential of 47 agricultural and livestock products for a cost of US$3.8 million. ADP
identified five companies with export potential in four sectors (brazil nuts, cochenilla,
angora wool and flowers). ADP's finding were that Bolivia lacked export experience and
that small and medium-sized companies in the rural sector had little access to investment
capital. In 1991, the Bank started preparation of the Agro-Export Development Project
which would be modeled on the Fundaci6n Chile.'
2.    The Bolivia Export Foundation was created in September 1991. The project
involved financing by two donors: IDA (16.6 million SDRs or US$ 22.5 million) and the
Netherlands (16.4 million guilders or US$8.9 million equivalent). An amount of 8.2
million SDRs of the IDA credit was considered as a grant to BEF and 8.4 million SDRs
as a loan from the Government to BEF to be reimbursed over a period of 25 years at a
rate of 7 percent per annum. The project become effective on November 9, 1992. The
Government of the Swiss Federation entered in co-financing in December 1993 for an
amount of 4.5 million Swiss Francs (US$3.2 million equivalent). BEF disposed of a total
of US$35 million to implement the Agro-Export Development Project. The project was
closed on December 31, 1997. An amount of US$7 million equivalent of the IDA credit
was canceled.
A. Project Objectives
3.    AEDP's objectives were to: (i) expand production and improve quality and price
competitiveness of agricultural goods for exports; (ii) create institutional capacity to help
entrepreneurs and investors selected by BEF develop agro-based export/import
enterprises; (iii) identify and import technology to assist such entrepreneurs and investors
to further develop their production and export capacity; (iv) increase market opportunities
for the exportation of agro-industrial products; and (v) create employment and generate
l Fundaci6n Chile was created to promote local agro-business, was sponsored by the United States
Government and received technical assistance from ITT Inc. There is not much comparison between
both foundations: Fundaci6n Chile's capital and human resources base was much more important
and it took much more time to develop business than in the Fundaci6n Bolivia Exporta.

capital accumulation in order to improve the incomes and standards of living of farmers,
women's groups and urban and rural laborers by expanding and developing new
agricultural and agro-processing enterprises. The Staff Appraisal Report clarifies point
(ii) as follows: to develop BEF as a private, autonomous, self-financing organization,
which would form financially sound, agro-based subsidiaries and joint ventures with
small- and medium-scale entrepreneurs.
4.    The project had three components: (i) the operations of BEF, including its
enterprise investment program, which initially was based on five identified companies in
the following four sectors: brazil nuts, cochenilla, angora wool and flowers; (ii) the
employment of an internationally recruited management team to run BEF at the start-up
and train a Bolivian team to take over the management; and (iii) provision by BEF of
technical assistance to its investment enterprises in marketing, financial management and
export.
5.    Comments on the project objectives and design: The project objectives as
stated in the Credit Agreement are a mixture of development objectives (production
expansion, increase in living standards), project outputs (institutional capacity) and
activities (import of technology, creation of enterprises). There was no ranking in the
objectives. The timetable to reach some objectives was too short. However, at the end of
the project no substantial new enterprise investment projects were in the pipeline and
funding was no longer needed.
6.    During project implementation some design flaws came to the surface: (i) no
guidelines were given on the type and the size of the investment enterprises in which BEF
was going to invest--this resulted in disagreements amongst donors on the type of BEF's
investments; and (ii) BEF had no explicit financial objectives and monitoring indicators
for the investment enterprises--as a result no clear guidelines were available for internal
and external monitoring of BEF or its portfolio.
B. Achievement of Project Objectives
7.    As no development objective monitoring indicators were established, it is
impossible to fully measure the achievement of the objectives.
8.    Increased agricultural output: The incremental output of the investment
enterprises in the period 1994-97 is as follows:
Amount (US$ '000)     Percentage
Brazil Nut Sector                   7,682       11%
Garlic                               216        279%
Wood doors                          2,431       78%
Other                                 94        80%
Total                              10,423

This may be considered low compared to the investment amount, but most of the export
expansion has still to be realized. BEF has contributed substantially to the development
of the brazil-nut sector in the Amazon region.
9.    Building BEF's capacity: BEF has developed into a government independent
organization, capable of evaluating business opportunities with export potential,
negotiating investment agreements with sometimes aggressive business partners and
following-up their investments in these private companies. At the same time BEF has
learned how to setup and guide pilot projects. Given its know-how of the Bolivian agro-
business, BEF could further play a role in the formation of rural investment enterprises.
10.   Introduction of technical improvements: This objective has also been reached.
BEF financed for US$6.5 million technological improvements and studies in the
investment enterprises--this represents one third of the total amount invested. State of the
art technology has been acquired in the international market.
11.   Increased employment: Employment in the investment enterprises has grown by
only 300 permanent positions. This is a low figure, which may however increase over
time when the portfolio is mature. Indirect employment is more difficult measure, but
includes seasonal jobs in the amazon, in the meat sector and forest sector.
Performance evaluation of BEF
12.   Portfolio. BEF invested US$19.6 million in 30 investment enterprises in the
following sectors: brazil nuts, garlic, fish, flowers, wood working, and food production
(see Tables 1 and 2). This portfolio is well distributed nationwide. Of this amount only
US$12.3 million are still active investments in eight investment enterprises. The losses
(failures) in investment enterprises to date are estimated at US$3.5 million. The total
amount spent on pilot projects is US$1.5 million.

13.   Pilot projects. Within the short period of active investment, BEF has focused on
sustainability rather than on pilot initiatives, which are inherently more time consuming
and bear more but smaller risks.
14.   Management and Operating Costs. Putting BEF's management cost in relation to
the value of the portfolio makes no sense for the first five years, since a large part of these
expenditures could be considered as start-up costs and learning money. But once the
portfolio volume is stable, monitoring of the ratio management cost/portfolio return will
be a very good performance measure in the future. At present, the forecasted revenue
from investments (US$500,000) covers the estimated operating expenditures. The yearly
returns combined with the increase in the portfolio value, however, should increase
rapidly to US$1.6 million per year (16 percent of the estimated average portfolio value).

Notes: 1992: only three months of operation; 1992-94: international management team; 1997: included
restructuring costs; 1998: forecast.
15.   Portfolio Performance. It has been a difficult and costly process to achieve the
actual portfolio of nine investments. The portfolio value is not yet completely stable (at
least one subproject can be considered as a high risk, two subprojects as low risks and
five as medium risks). Most investments are only one or two years old and two more
years are needed to see if these investments will make it or not. The portfolio is well
protected through the fact that there is a lot at stake for the business partners of BEF
themselves. It is difficult to value this portfolio, but taking in account the net profits of
the last three years, combined with the projected net profits for the years 1998 - 2000, the
portfolio value at 31 December 97 is estimated between US$8 and US$12 million.



5
16.   Financial ratios: The SAR does not specify factors permitting to measure the
performance of the portfolio. The financial and economic rates of return mentioned in
the SAR were entirely based on the financial projections for the five enterprises identified
in the SAR. The overall financial rate of return of AEDP was projected at 20 percent
calculated over 15 years (and as such included a high degree of uncertainty). This value
was surely optimistic and at the end of the project it was not possible to give a reliable
prognosis of the Financial Rate of Return. Taking into account the amount (US$19.6
million) put into investment enterprises (excluding pilot projects) and the cost of capital
(17 percent)2, the actual value of the portfolio should have been about US$19.5 million.
This compares with the estimated portfolio value of US$8-12 million.
C. Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
17.   Despite a very generous investment budget, an expensive team of four
international professionals, the direct availability of studies worth US$3.8 million and the
permanent presence of a Bank representative solely dedicated to the project, the first two
project years of implementation were a failure. Apart from a few pilot initiatives, no
investments took place. Most attention went to market studies and the establishment of
the five investment enterprises in the SAR as BEF solo operations without partners. This
proved to be impossible, as most solo enterprises would have also created competition
with the established private sector.
18.   In its second year, BEF invited proposals from the public. The analysis of 256
(mostly badly prepared) proposals by international professionals took a year. The donors
(in particular the Bank and the Dutch Government), lacking business experience, got
deeper and deeper involved in BEF's daily management. This provoked a bad
relationship between the international management team on the one hand, and BEF's
board of directors and the Bank's representative on the other hand. As a result, in May
1994 the international management team was reduced to two people and a Bolivian
management team took over.
19.   At the mid-term review (May 1995), two important changes had a direct impact
on operations and strategies: (i) the international management team is completely
replaced by a Bolivian team; and (ii) permanent monitoring by the Bank is replaced by
two supervision missions per year. From mid-95 onwards BEF changed its strategy
focusing on sustainability. It identified medium-size enterprises with export potential and
companies with potential for financial return. The bulk of the investments took place
during the last 18 months of the project.
20.   It is also during this period that the proper procedures for evaluation and follow-
up have been installed. A simple set of accounting, financial and management thumb

at 17%.

rules should have been implemented from day one, introduced in the investment
enterprises and be adjusted while BEF was getting experience. The first professional
financial follow-up reports on the investment enterprises of the BEF portfolio appear only
in December 1996 (based on the financial reporting manual elaborated in September
1996). This lack of follow-up and financial reporting has allowed two investment
enterprises to use investment enterprise funds for other purposes.
21.   In 1997, BEF got involved into a desinvestment court case. BEF's management
handled the case through the weak and poorly guided judicial system, but failed to
recover much of the money. The judicial case took up significant management time,
caused enormous stress and had an adverse impact on BEF's morale. Although it showed
the BEF managers' courageous determination to make its partners honor their
obligations, it also demonstrated that business partners need more lines of defense than a
government-sponsored entity can assemble.3 It also illustrates how difficult it is for an
agency such as BEF to make its partners honor their agreements in the Bolivian business
environment.
D. Project Sustainability and Continuity
22.   Sustainability. BEF's sustainability is likely. BEF and the Government have
agreed on June 8, 1998 on a debt repayment plan. Debt payments to the Government can
be made with the income from planned desinvestments. Some level of riskiness remains
since no analysis has been made of possible scenarios to obtain cash through repayment
of equity (management buy-out, sale to third parties, introduction on the future Bolivian
Stock Exchange). Operational costs can be covered by income from financial operations
and dividends from the investment enterprises. Most likely dividends and desinvestments
will be sufficient to cover operational costs and to reimburse the government loan.
23.   Continuity of the Project. The design of the project supposed that BEF would
continue investing in enterprises with the funds recovered from desinvestments and
dividends. This continuity seems unlikely at least for the near future, since there are no
new investment enterprises in the pipeline (besides some investment extensions in
existing joint-ventures).
24.   In the next five years the following three main scenarios are possible:
Best: BEF reimburses its debt on schedule (through desinvestments) and can
attract new private or donor money because of its capacity to run this
Foundation. In this case, BEF will turn into a dynamic entity and all
project objectives will have been reached.
3  Private business partners cover their agreements with family and other business ties, which BEF does
not have.



7
Modest: BEF reimburses on schedule but turns into a dormant stage in which
BEF only supervises its existing portfolio. The result of this scenario
will be that some investment enterprises will have been able to grow
thanks to BEF's investments.
Worst: Some large investments appear to be lame ducks and the snow ball effect
will pull down the value of the portfolio. It may then not be possible to
fully reimburse the Government.
E. Bank Performance
25.   Overall Bank performance is rated as unsatisfactory.
(i) Preparation and design. The project design lacked prioritization of project
objectives and was wrong in proposing to start up five new companies from
scratch. The SAR had no clear monitoring indicators. There was an
inherent hybrid element in the design which got never resolved during
implementation: people involved in the design and management of the
project had a typical professional profile of development aid operations,
while BEF's implementation required real business people.4
(ii) Implementation. During the first project years, monitoring by the Bank was
less then satisfactory. The Bank should have put a staff member,
experienced in business, as project supervisor. Moreover, as an efficient
project supervisor, the Bank should not have permitted that its representative
in the project had such an open and paralyzing conflict with BEF's
management team during 2.5 years. In the second half of the project, the
Bank gave clear guidelines and accelerated approval of investments. It
emphasized: (i) effective control of the portfolio; (ii) strengthening of the
management team; and (iii) sustainability. It neglected, however, to
emphasize the need for pilot operations and pipeline development.
26.   Other Donors Performance. The Dutch and Swiss Governments had a shared
responsibility with the Bank for project implementation. They were members of the BEF
Board5 and were very much involved in project management at start-up. Despite their
disagreements with strategic issues, they have provided the Bank with continuous
support.
4  This was understood by the people who first designed the project in 90-91 and who asked for a setup
in which the initial management team would be required to invest US$1.5 milion in the fund. This
was finally not done.
The Dutch government withdrew as a voting member in 1996.



8
F. Borrower Performance
27.   Government Performance. Government performance has been satisfactory. The
Government has respected BEF's structure as an independent private organization with
little government involvement. There was, however, a high turn over of Government
representatives on BEF's Board.
28.   Management Performance: Management performance is marginally satisfactory.
It is questionable whether the delay in investments during the first years of the project
were caused by the low quality of the international management team or were inherent to
the project design and as such unavoidable. The facts are that: (i) part of the same team
was already working on the ADP project during nearly two years before the project start-
up; (ii) their conflict with the Bank and the BEF Board of Directors put the brakes on
many of their proposals; and (iii) for the same cost of one of the international managers, a
Bolivian top private manager could have been recruited. This could have created a totally
different relationship between the Board and the management and would have moved the
project forward much faster. At the departure of the international team, the Bolivian team
had yet to start with the learning process and few operational investment procedures were
available.
29.   The Bolivian team performed better. The team has invested US$21 million in
2.5 years. It has learned to manage BEF, but also at a high cost. The team has now the
capacity to follow-up the portfolio, but it did not perform well enough to avoid financial
losses and overvaluations of some of its investments. Follow-up of the well justified
recommendations of the different Bank supervision missions has been slow and
incomplete. It is possible that, now that BEF has to take full responsibility for its
performance and can not longer rely on Bank supervision, the team will become more
pro-active and efficient. There remains, however, still a need for an in-house person with
real business feeling and experience.
30.   BEF Board of Directors Performance. Decision-making at the Board has been
slow. With the operational and financial structure inherent to this project and without the
Directors having a financial stake in BEF, it will be hard to compose a more efficient
Board of Directors. Dedication to the Board has not been equal between the different
directors.
G. Assessment of Outcome
31.   The overall outcome of the project is unsatisfactory. Although the institutional
project objectives have been met, BEF's impact on the overall agro-export sector has
been small and its financial performance is at present unsatisfactory. The value of the
portfolio has declined by about 25 percent over 2.5 years. Project implementation
showed important shortcomings in the portfolio monitoring which has allowed financial
losses. BEF's sustainability is likely now that a definitive agreement on the debt level



9
with the Government has been reached. BEF's ultimate financial performance will
depend on the performance of some key investments.
H. Future Operation
32.   The project has been shielded from government interference and private sector
abuse by the presence of the donors. As donors are withdrawing, some investment
partners already want BEF to desinvest in their enterprises because they fear that, once
the donors have left, the Government could become their partner instead of BEF.
Therefore it could be very efficient (comparing cost to possible impact) if BEF could
continue to use its relationship with the Bank and the other donors. This relationship
could be given the form of a special fund to finance about 4 weeks of supervisory and
advisory services per year for two years following the end of the project to allow the
portfolio to mature.
33.   A SociedadAnonima (corporation) to be created with the funds that could be
available at the end of 1998, together with the shares of one or two of the biggest and best
investments of the portfolio, would permit BEF to attract private money and act as a
vehicle for the more aggressive business operations. BEF as such could continue to work
on smaller pilot projects. The Swiss Government is showing interest in participating in
such corporation.
I. Key Lessons Learned
34.   Bureaucrats should stay out of business. The principal lesson that can be
drawn from project implementation is that top entrepreneurial management is necessary
to invest and monitor the use of such a large portfolio. A business operation managed by
people with a public service or development aid profile is likely to underperform.
35.   Business Strategy. The two following lessons are less important during startup
but eventually decisive for the success of the foundation:
(i) Step by step investments: each company has its own development capacity
and over capitalization can be as disastrous as lacking capital. Especially in
case of less experienced enterprises, it is important to limit the damage of
failure, invest step by step and allow for increasing knowledge and market
build-up;
(ii) BEF should not create new companies from scratch, unless it concerns
smaller enterprises were no alternatives are available and/or other criteria,
like social impact, are principal; and
(iii) When investing in companies, BEF should introduced immediately own
accounting and financial management procedures, allowing it to monitor the
company's performance on a daily basis.



10
36.   Need for a competent local partner. The combination of local business
relations, understanding of the local business realities and private money (the business
drive) could have been obtained by including from the beginning a local private financial
institution as partner in BEF.
37.   Legal framework. In a legal framework where contracts can not be enforced
through courts, official business is hard to carry out. Companies in Bolivia are mainly
family businesses which can enforce contracts using multiple contract compliance
strategies (through family relations and other business ties). An organization such as
BEF does not have this type of business relationships and has difficulty working in such
environment.

BOLIVIA
PROYECTO DE DESARROLLO DE AGRO-EXPORTACIONES
Cr 2322-BO
Ayuda Memoria de la Misi6n Final
Informe de Ejecuci6n del Proyecto (ICR)
1.    La misi6n final del Banco Mundial, constituida por los seinores Pierre Werbrouck
(Jefe de misi6n) y Michel Buyckx (consultor) se ha realizado en Bolivia del 27 Enero al 9
de febrero de 1998. Previamente el Sr. Buyckx ha estado en Washington del 22 al 26 de
enero 1998 revisando todos los documentos vinculados al Proyecto. En Bolivia, la
misi6n recibi6 un apoyo del Gobierno de los Paises Bajos. La misi6n se ha contactado al
Presidente de la Fundaci6n Bolivia Exporta (FBE) y sus principales ejecutivos; los
gerentes de las empresas Mabet, Dillman, Flobolsa, Titikaka y Pairumani Foliage; la
embajador de los Paises Bajos en Bolivia y el representante de la Agencia Suiza para el
Desarrollo y la Cooperaci6n (COSUDE). La misi6n ha participado tambien en la reuni6n
de Directorio de la FBE, el dia 7 Febrero 1998. La misi6n agradece a todas las
autoridades y personas responsables entrevistadas por su colaboraci6n y por las sesiones
de trabajo muy productivo.
Introducci6n
2.     La FBE ha sido creada en marzo de 1992. Este proyecto fue financiado por IDA
con 16.6 millones de DEGs (equivalente a US$22.5 millones) y el Gobiemo de los Paises
Bajos 16.4 millones de florines holandeses (equivalente a US$ 8.9 millones). Un monto
de 9.8 millones de DEGs en forma de credito y un monto de 6.8 millones de DEGs en
forma de donaci6n fueron transferidos del Gobiemo de Bolivia a la FBE para ser
reembolsados en 25 anios a una tasa de interes del 7%. El Proyecto fue aprobado por el
Banco Mundial el 9 de septiembre de 1992. El Gobiemo de la Confederaci6n Suiza se
integr6 como co-financiador en diciembre de 1993 por un monto de 4.5 millones de
Francos Suizos (equivalente a US$3.2 millones). En total la FBE contaba con un monto
de US$35 millones para implementar el proyecto de agro-exportaciones. El proyecto ha
sido concluido el 31 de diciembre de 1997, quedando un saldo no utilizado de US$10.3
millones.
A. Objetivos del Proyecto
3.    Los objetivos del proyecto son: (i) expandir la producci6n, la calidad y la
competitividad de los productos agricolas; (ii) crear una capacidad institucional para
ayudar a los empresarios e inversionistas seleccionados por la FBE; (iii) identificar e
importar tecnologias para brindar asistencia a tales empresarios e inversionistas; (iv)
incrementar las oportunidades de mercado para la exportaci6n de productos

23
agroindustriales; (v) crear empleo y generar acumulaci6n de capital para mejorar los
ingresos y los niveles de vida de los agricultores.
B. Implementaci6n y Resultados
4.    La misi6n final concluye que los resultados del proyecto son insatisfactorios. A
pesar de que la FBE se ha desarrollado como una organizaci6n capaz de invertir y de
ejecutar el seguimiento de su portafolio de inversiones, los costos han sido
extremadamente altos (US$5.5 millones de costos operacionales en cinco afios) y el valor
del portafolio ha disminuido considerablemente debido a algunas inversiones que
resultaron en perdidas importantes. La FBE ha invertido un monto total de US$19.6
millones cuyo valor actual de mercado se estima entre US$8 y US$12 millones.
Finalmente cabe recalcar que como gran parte de estas inversiones son nuevas, el valor
del portafolio puede cambiar en el futuro.
5.   Dos factores claves afectaron el desempefno del proyecto: (i) casi dos afios fueron
perdidos al inicio del proyecto por causa de una gesti6n inadecuada del equipo gerencial
intemacional y de una supervisi6n deficiente de parte del Banco Mundial; y (ii) la FBE
nunca tuvo un equipo de gesti6n suficientemente calificado para bien evaluar el riesgo en
las inversiones y monitorear adecuadamente su portafolio.
C. Resumen de la Evaluaci6n Final
6.     Debido a la incertidumbre vinculada al valor futuro del portafolio y al proceso
de desinversi6n, es dificil estimar o predecir si la FBE tendra problemas de liquidez en el
futuro. No obstante se estima que en la actualidad el portafolio es suficiente para honrar
la deuda con el Gobierno de Bolivia.
7.    La preparaci6n y el seguimiento del Banco Mundial no han sido satisfactorios:
(i) el disefio del proyecto no contemplaba prioridades en sus objetivos y estrategias de
ejecuci6n; (ii) se considera un error la concepci6n de arrancar con cinco nuevas empresas;
(iii) la mayoria de las personas involucradas en la preparaci6n y gesti6n del proyecto a
todos los niveles (Banco Mundial, FBE, co-financiadores) no tenian experiencia ni
habilidad para los negocios ya que tenian el perfil de tipo bur6crata; y (iv) durante los dos
primeros afios la supervisi6n del Banco Mundial no fue capaz de acelerar el arranque del
proyecto ni de limitar los gastos operativos.
8.    Por su parte, la contribuci6n del Gobiemo fue satisfactoria habiendo respetado la
estructura independiente de la FBE.
9.    Con respecto a la gesti6n de la Fundaci6n, se la puede calificar como
marginalmente satisfactoria: (i) el equipo internacional no consigui6 realizar inversiones,
tampoco introdujo sistemas de evaluaci6n y seguimiento; (ii) el equipo Boliviano realiz6
bastantes inversiones en un corto periodo, pero falt6 de experiencia en evaluaci6n y
seguimiento de inversiones.

10.   Finalmente, el rol del Directorio de la FBE fue marginalmente satisfactorio, por
falta de toma de decisiones y de seguimiento a la gerencia.
D. Operaciones Futuras
11.   Se recomienda que el Banco y los financiadores bilaterales continuien su relaci6n
formal con la FBE para asegurar su independencia e imagen y para apoyar de manera
puntual en algunas etapas importantes de las decisiones empresariales.
12.   Se recomienda que la FBE cree una sociedad an6nima para asegurar su
sostenibilidad (seguimiento de inversiones y captaci6n de nuevos recursos financieros).
De esta manera la Fundaci6n podra continuar con sus objetivos, principalmente de
generar proyectos piloto (incubadoras de empresas).
E. Principales Lecciones
13.   Este tipo de proyectos de inversiones de riesgo, requiere contar con una estructura
de tipo empresarial muy calificada. Se debera tener en cuenta en los proyectos de
inversi6n que estos requieren de un proceso de inversi6n paso a paso y con empresas que
hayan mostrado experiencia.
F. Varios
14.   La misi6n ha recibido un borrador del informe final del Proyecto, elaborado por la
FBE. La versi6n final sera presentada antes del 28 de febrero de 1998.
15.   El informe de auditoria extema sera enviado al AIF antes del 31 de Marzo de
1998.

De mi consideracidn:
Hago referencia a su nota del 12 de junio pasado, a trav6s de la cual solicita
los comentarios de este Viceministerio en relaci6n a! informe de conclusl6n
del proyecto de referencia.
Al respecto, me permito comunicarle las siguientes observaciones sobre el
citado documen to:
 En relaci6n a la sostenibilidad del proyecto (punto 6.J, deberfa aclararse
con mayor detalle bajo que premisas esta sostenibilidad puede ser
factible, considerando que inicialmente el proyecto estaba destinado a
incrementar los niveles de ingreso de camnpesinos y grupos de mujeres,
sin embargo las inversiones de la Fundacidn Bolivia Exporta (FBE) han sfdo
dirigidas a empresas comerciales.
* En lo referente a intervenciones temporales (p unto 12.) se deberfa eclarar
hasta que punto dstas intervenciones, que en faorna conjunta llegaron a
5,3 millones de d6lares, han tenido un impacto permanente en los
distintos sectores productivos, particularmente en la produccidn y
exportaciKn de castafia (brazilian nuts).

* Con relacion al punto 24, el mejor escenario posible esta basado en
fuertes premisas, sin embargo algunos donantes, como Holanda han
decidido no continuar con el proyecto. Asimismo, se menciona que a
travds de la captaciones de recursos privados, la FBE podrba convertirse
en una entidad dinalmica, sin embargo dichos recursos podrdn ser
Onicamente captados si existen altos retornos a la inversion, y este
objetivo, no necesariamente coincide con los objetivos iniciales del
proyecto.
Con este motivo, saludo a usted atentamente.

COMENTARIOS DE LA FUNDACION BOLIVIA EXPORTA
B1O L I V I A
E X P 0 R T A          AL INFORME DE CIERRE DE PROYECTO (ICR)
DEL BANCO MUNDIAL
1.   El comportamiento de la FUNDACION BOLNIA EXPORTA (FBE), en todos los
6rdenes, a saber: el institucional, econ6mico, financiero, social y medio ambiental asi como
las calificaciones descritas en el Informe de Cierre de Proyecto (ICR) del Banco Mundial,
deben ser objeto, y creemos que asf lo son, del analisis de las bases de su creacion y
sobretodo del marco legal en que se desenvuelve, es decir sus estatutos y los acuerdos
suscritos entre los diferentes participantes (Gobierno de Bolivia; Gobiernos de Suiza y
Holanda; Banco Mundial y Fundaci6n Bolivia Exporta).
En este entendido, el presente documento de comentarios al ICR, es fruto de la
lectura de ese marco legal y refleja el punto de vista del Directorio, a partir de sus
responsabilidades y de su propio origen, por lo que se limitara a observar aspectos que no
hayan sido expuestos en nuestro Informe Quinquenal presentado al Banco Mundial el 25
de febrero de 1998.
2.   Dado el cronoorama demasiado corto (5 affos) para alcanzar los objetivos del
Proyecto, periodo de tiempo insuficiente en cualquier parte, los resultados del proyecto, no
pueden ser anticipadamente evaluados como satisfactorios ni insatisfactorios. La
caracteristica institucional del proyecto, el valor de las inversiones y el tiempo de
maduraci6n de las mismas, sittia al mismo como un proyecto en pleno desarrollo. (Punto 4;
B; Evaluation Summary).
3.   Compartimos el juicio sobre las imperfecciones del diseno del proyecto (punto 6; A;
Project Objectives; Part I) y ampliamos el mismo, dado que la FBE tuvo que rediseflar el
proyecto con el apoyo de las Misiones del Banco Mundial.
4.   Es importante sefalar, que la actividad prioritaria de la FBE, fue la inversi6n de
riesgo en empresas del sector agricola y agroindustrial y por lo tanto su existencia y los
compromisos contraidos, han sido objeto de preocupaci6n para alcanzar su sostenibilidad,
la misma que de no mediar acontecimientos de fuerza mayor es plenamente factible.
5.   La principal lecci6n a nuestro juicio, es la validez del modelo institucional y la
modalidad de participaci6n con inversi6n de riesgo, lo que permiti6 que la FBE como ente
privado capitalice empresas en el sector productivo, privado. Estas capitalizaciones,
generaron transferencia de tecnologla; alianzas estrat6gicas; formalizaci6n de empresas;
metodos de valoraci6n, evaluaci6n y preparaci6n de proyectos; generaci6n de empfeo
directo e indirecto; generaci6n de valor agregado y toma de conciencia del manejo
medioambiental.
Calkc 16 eeuina Julio C. PaUto N' 8085, Calacdo o TcIF&.: 770342 - 770343 -790411 - 770322 - 770494 * Fax: (591-2) 770315 * Casilla 473 * E*mail: fbezceibo entclneLbo  La Paz- bolivia



28
Siguiendo esta experiencia y tomando en cuenta las fallas de la misma en el disefio,
este modelo institucional garantiza el logro de objetivos y su sostenibilidad. Actualmente la
FBE genera sus propios recursos para su funcionamiento y tiene aproximadamente
US$.1.500.000.oo en manejo financiero, recursos que a diciembre de 1998 ascenderan a
US$.4.000.000.oo. (t)
6.    La metodologia de valoraci6n del portafolio de la FBE que aplica el Banco Mundial y
que se explica en el punto 15 de la Secci6n B, Part I, supone empresas sin expectativa de
crecimiento y aplica un factor constante (costo relevante de capital=10%) a la utilidad
operativa del periodo corriente, o en su caso un promedio de los ultimos periodos, lo que
significa niveles no representativos del potencial futuro. En opini6n de la FBE, este metodo
de valoraci6n no es el apropiado para el portafolio de la FBE y tiene como resultado una
subvaloraci6n econ6mica del mismo.
Fruto de la reciente capitalizaci6n por parte de la FBE, en todos lo casos se verifica un
proceso de maduraci6n financiera de las inversiones y consecuentemente expectativas de
crecimiento futuras de los flujos de caja libre.
7.    Las recomendaciones sobre la permanencia de los financiadores en el seno de la
FBE, expresadas en el punto 32, Secci6n H, Part I, son compartidas y necesarias, ello
permitira un seguimiento del accionar de la instituci6n, de manera de poder realizar
ulteriores evaluaciones y acompaflar la evoluci6n de la FBE al ritmo que le exija la
magnitud de actividades (bisqueda de nuevas fuentes de financiamiento; desinversiones
en las empresas; diversificaci6n de sus actividades; creaci6n de un ente netamente
mercantil y trabajos en proyectos piloto).
 La instituci6n es objeto de dos tesis de grado en la Universidad Catolica de Bolivia y sus personeros han
sido invitados por universidades del pais a explicar el modelo institucional y sobretodo la metodologia de
valoraci6n de empresas. Por otra parte, la principal raz6n de no ser comparable con Fundaci6n Chile, es
que segun los propios personeros de Fundaci6n Chile, sus sostenibilidad se basa en gran parte en el
rendimiento financiero de los fondos (US$.50.0 millones) desde un inicio en calidad de fideicomiso y no asi
en el rendimiento de sus inversiones.

La FUNDACION BOLIVIA EXPORTA (FBE), fue creada el 20 de septiembre de 1991, como una
entidad de derecho privado, cuya fuente de recursos financieros provenie del Convenio de
Credito y Donaci6n, de la Asociaci6n Internacional de Fomento (AIF) y los Gobiernos de los
Pafses Bajos y Suiza respectivamente. Sus areas exclusivas de desenvolvimiento son la
agropecuaria y la agroindustria, debiendo las inversiones a realizarse en estos sectores cumplir
basicamente con objetivos de impacto en el desarrollo econ6mico social y ecol6gico del pals.
Su objetivo general es el incremento y diversificaci6n de las exportaciones no tradicionales.
Su objetivo especifico es desarrollar y ampliar empresas productivas de transformaci6n y/o
comercializaci6n en el area agropecuaria y agroindustrial.
I.    MARCO INSTITUCIONAL
La FBE tiene su oirigen en el Proyecto de Desarrollo Agropecuario (PDA), ejecutado por
DHV/Consultores, con el objeto de estudiar el potencial agroexportador del pals. Este proyecto
que tuvo una duracikn de dos aflos, elabor6 cinco estudios de factibilidad (Castafla; Cochinilla;
Pelo de angora, Aceites esenciales y Flores) y una propuesta institucional, documentos base del
Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) de la AIF.
La FUNDACION BOLIVIA EXPORTA (FBE), esta regulada por las siguientes disposiciones
legales:
1)   RESOLUCION SUPREMA 209621: Norma legal de 20 de septiembre de 1991 por
la que se otorga personalidad juridica a la Fundaci6n Bolivia Exporta, como entidad de
derecho privado sin fines de lucro.
2)   CONVENIO DE CREDITO 2322-BO (CC): Convenio suscrito el 4 de marzo de
1992, entre la Republica de Bolivia y la Asociaci6n Internacional de Fomento, por el que
se establece el objeto y condiciones de un credito de 16.6 millones de Derechos
Especiales de Giro, para la ejecuci6n de Proyecto de Desarrollo de Agroexportaciones.
3)   ACUERDO DE PROYECTO (AP): Acuerdo suscrito el 4 de marzo de 1992, entre la
Fundaci6n Bolivia Exporta y la Asociaci6n Internacional de Fomento, por el que se
establecen las condiciones de participaci6n de la Asociaci6n Internacional de Fomento en
el Convenio de Credito 2322-BO con la Repuiblica de Bolivia y las condiciones en que la
Fundaci6n Bolivia Exporta debera ejecutar el Proyecto.
4)   LEY DE LA REPUBLICA 1346: Norma legal de 15 de septiembre de 1992, que
aprueba el Convenio de Credito 2322-BO a la Republica de Bolivia y a la Fundaci6n
Bolivia Exporta como ente ejecutor del Proyecto de Desarrollo de Agroexportaciones.
5)   CONTRATO DE ADMINISTRACION: Contrato suscrito el 28 de septiembre de
1992, entre la Fundaci6n Bolivia Exporta y la Empresa Administradora, por el que se
contrata los servicios de administraci6n del Consorcio DHV/HVA, bajo t6rminos y



32
condiciones satisfactorias para la Asociaci6n Internacional de Fomento, por un tiempo de
tres aflos, renovable por otros dos afos adicionales.
6)   CONVENIO DE ADMINISTRACION DE RECURSOS: Convenio suscrito el 20 de
octubre de 1992, entre la Republica de Bolivia y la Fundaci6n Bolivia Exporta, por el que
se establecen los tKrminos y condiciones de transferencia de los recursos provenientes
del Credito 2322-BO a la Fundaci6n Bolivia Exporta.
II.   RESPONSABILIDADES
7)   Si bien el 6rgano de maxima decisi6n de acuerdo a los estatutos de la FBE, es su
Directorio, el origen y tenencia de los recursos y los compromisos establecidos, hacen
que las responsabilidades sean compartidas por el Directorio y los Financiadores.
8)   La AIF por su parte, al contar con los recursos tanto del cr6dito como de los
donantes y tener un rol supervisor en el envfo de fondos a trav6s del Banco Central de
Bolivia y de acuerdo a una metodologla y cronograma de desembolsos y descargos, tenla
conocimiento pleno de los proyectos, de manera de contar con los instrumentos
suficientes que resguarda su responsabilidad al dar su "no objecion" o "su objeci6n", es
decir aprobar o no un proyecto y su desembolso, ain si el proyecto hubiera sido aprobado
por el Directorio de la F.B.E.
9)   El diseflo del proyecto tenfa como condici6n previa de aprobaci6n del cr6dito de la
AIF, la contrataci6n de una empresa internacional que gerente la FBE y capacite al
personal nacional. La FBE contrata los servicios del consorcio de Consultores DHV/HVA
de Holanda, en el entendido que era la empresa mejor calificada, dada la experiencia de
esta empresa en la eiecuci6n del PDA.
10)  Si bien la misma empresa DHV-Consultores fue la que elabor6 los estudios del
PDA, los profesionales que arribaron a Bolivia en calidad de Gerentes de la FBE, no eran
los mismos que trabajaron en la primera etapa y este nuevo equipo tenla comunicaci6n
muy precaria con su empresa matriz (DHV-Holanda). Por otra parte, el equipo gerencial
contratado, no tenia una contraparte de direcci6n nacional y no eran dependientes del
Directorio de la FBE, ya que su contrato de trabajo fue firmado directamente con
DHV/HVA, quien a su vez, tenla una relaci6n contractual con la F.B.E.
11)  Estos factores y el desconocimiento de la realidad econ6mica y social de Bolivia,
pueden explicar en parte, el que no se hayan ejecutado proyectos los primeros aflos de
existencia de la FBE, aflos que se dedicaron mas bien al analisis de nuevos proyectos;
conocimiento del pals y revisi6n de los estudios del PDA. Los proyectos elaborados en el
perlodo PDA 1989-1991, por diversas razones hablan perdido ventajas cualitativas y
cuantitativas.
12)  En este contexto, el rol de la AIF ha sido vital para la instituci6n, principalmente por
el acompaflamiento en todas las actividades y decisiones de la FBE. Debemos
diferenciar dos etapas y actitudes en estos cinco aflos. Una primera etapa 1993-1995, en
la que se insisti6 en la elaboraci6n de sistemas y una etapa posterior, 1995-1997 que se



33
caracteriz6 por ser operativa, es decir se prioriz6 la ejecuci6n de proyectos, dando a la
FBE mayor autonomla.
ill.   VIGENCIA Y ESTADO DE,SITUACION
13)  El Acuerdo del Proyecto concluye en la fecha en que el Convenio de Cr6dito
concluya. El Convenio de Credito, establece el 31 de diciembre de 1997 como fecha de.
cierre o una fecha posterior establecida por la AIF, que esta OlItima notificara a la
Republica de Bolivia.
14)  En noviembre de 1992, la AIF comunica su no objeci6n al Convenio de Cr6dito y
la FBE inicia sus actividades en el marco establecido en el Programa 2 del Convenio de
Credito, el mismo que describe los objetivos y sus componentes, a saber: proyectos de
inversi6n; fortalocimiento institucional e investigaci6n y transferencia de tecnologla.
15)   El Convenio de Credito establece en su Programa 1, categorlas de financiamiento
que asignan montos y porcentajes de los gastos elegibles a ser financiados por el
Convenio de Cr6dito, segUn los objetivos del proyecto.
16)  Durante la vigencia del Acuerdo de Proyecto y Convenio de Credito, se han
efectuado las siguientes modificaciones: i) Reprogramaci6n de los montos y porcentajes
de financiamiento segun categorlas (adendums 1 y 2 al Convenio de Credito); ii)
Rescisi6n del Contrato de Administraci6n firmado con la firma administradora en una
fecha anterior a la prevista.
17)  El Convenio de Administracion de Recursos (CAR), por los fondos obtenidos de la
A.l.F. y que ascienden a DEG's 16.600.000, establece los siguientes t6rminos y
condiciones: i) 8.4 millones de DEG's en forma de cr6dito y 8.2 millones de DEG's en
forma de donaci6n; ii) una tasa anual de inter6s por los montos obtenidos como cr6dito de
7%; iii) cinco aflos de gracia para el pago de intereses y 10 aflos de gracia para el pago
de capital; iv) pago de cuotas similares de forma semestral y un plazo total de 25 aflos.
Este sistema permite a la FBE, que al cabo de los 25 aflos complete el pago de los 16.6
millones de DEG's a la Republica de Bolivia.
18)  Al 31 de diciembre de 1997, la AIF y los Gobiernos de Holanda y Suiza, han
desembolsado el equivalente de US$.25.263.262 distribuidos de acuerdo a las
Categorlas y montos asignados en el Convenio de Credito (Anexo 1). A esta fecha han
quedado montos no utilizados que ascienden al equivalente de US$.10.346.435.-
IV.  DIRECCION-GESTION Y SEGUIMIENTO
19)  El Directorio esta compuesto en su mayorla por personalidades del sector privado
y su representaci6n es a titulo personal. Este Directorio ha sido designado por invitaci6n
de los Gobiernos de Bolivia y Holanda y por una selecci6n previa a trav6s de una
consultorla contratada para el efecto por la AIF.



34
20)  El Directorio tiene como marco de acci6n los siguiente instrumentos: (i) Plan Anual
de Trabajo; (ii) Memoria Anual de Gesti6n; (iii) Auditorla Externa Anual; (iv) Informe de
Evaluaci6n de las Misiones de la AIF.
21)  El Directorio luego de evaluar la gestion internacional del Consorcio DHV/HVA,
decidio en junio de 1994, rescindir el contrato de administraci6n, dado que los costos de
dicha administraci6n eran extremadamente elevados para los rendimientos que
mostraban las gestiones de 1993 y 1994, que no lograron cumplir las metas propuestas
en los Planes Anuales de Trabajo. Los pagos realizados por la FBE al Consorcio
DHV/HVA ascienden a US$.1.885.865.-
22)  Los proyectos aprobados por el Directorio se procesaron en las siguientes
instancias: (i) Comit6 de Gerencia; (ii) Comit6 de Directorio; (iii) Directorio y (iv) No
Objeci6n de la AIF.
23)  A partir de la sustituci6n de la empresa administradora por personal ejecutivo
nacional, se tiene una sustancial reducci6n en los gastos de funcionamiento, de
US$.3.399.990 gestiones 1993/1995, a US$.1.785.682 en las gestiones 1996 y 1997.
(ver Anexo 1- Gastos Categorla 2 Add.1 - Funcionamiento FBE).
V.   PORTAFOLIO DE INVERSIONES
24)  La FBE contaba como referencia para sus actividades, con estudios de factibilidad
de: castafia, flores, cochinilla, aceites esenciales y pelo de angora, asl como un listado de
47 productos susceptibles de potenciar su producci6n exportable.
25)  La FBE al tercer aflo de actividades, elabor6 estrategias sectoriales que le
permitlan buscar proyectos y no esperar que estos lleguen a la instituci6n, habiendo
definido centrar sus actividades, en los siguientes sectores/productos: castafla;
manufacturas de madera; manufacturas de cuero; alimentos envasados; hortalizas
frescas y flores.
26)  Se defini6 que los proyectos de investigaci6n y transferencia de tecnologla deblan
ser financiados con la participaci6n conjunta de otras instituciones especializadas y
serlan ejecutadas solo cuando se llegue a un portafolio de inversiones que garantice la
sostenibilidad de la instituci6n.
27)  La FBE en cinco aflos de actividad, invirti6 en Proyectos de Inversi6n,
US$.18.093.340; en Proyectos Piloto de Investigaci6n y transferencia de tecnologla,
Categorla 3, US$.1.584.250.-; Gastos de funcionamiento de la instituci6n - Categorla 2
Add. 1 US$.5.185.672; Anticr6tico oficina - Categorla 4, US$.400.000.-; habiendo
ejecutado un total de US$.25.263.262.
28)  A la fecha la FBE cuenta con un portafolio de: a) 10 proyectos en ejecuci6n:
FLOBOLSA - flores en Cochabamba; PAIRUMANI - baby blue en Cochabamba;
DILLMANN - alimentos en Cochabamba; PERASPAMPA - flores en Sucre; PROTISA -
truchas en el lago Titikaka en La Paz; MABET - puertas y ventanas de madera en La Paz;
TAHUAMANU - beneficiado de castafla en Cobija; AJO - Producci6n y Comercializacion



35
de Ajo en Tairija; BOSQUES DEL NORTE - marcos de madera en La Paz; TAHUAMANU
- Sociedad Accidental para acopio de castafla en la Zafra 1997-1998.
b) 16 Proyectos Concluldos: SAN SILVESTRE - acopio de castafla; BCP Alpaca
Designs - prendas de alpaca en La Paz, COCHINILLA; STEVIA; BIT - Comercializadora
La Paz; ZOOMUNDO Trading - peces ornamentales en Trinidad; BENEFICIADORA
Harold CLAURE - 95-96; 96-97; BENEFICIADORA Waldemar BEZERRA - 95-96; 96-97;
BENEFICIADORA JABIEX 95-96; HECKER HNOS. S.A. - 95-96; TAHUAMANU SRL-
95-96; 96-97; CARBEN SRL - estudio de mercado para prendas de vestir; SAITAM -
estudio factibilidad para instalar una fabrica de aceite soya.
c) 4 proyectos con acciones legales y en proceso de desinversi6n y/o liquidaci6n;
TRICOM - puertas de madera en La Paz; AMERICA  - beneficiado de castafla en
Riberalta; GRANEL - aceite de soya en Santa Cruz.; LIRA - Producci6n de urnas
funerarias.
29)  La aplicaci6n de recursos por la ejecuci6n de los proyectos durante los primeros 5
afos de vida de la F.B.E fue de 3% el 1993; 0% el 1994; 24% el 1995; 22% el 1996 y
51 % el 1997.
VI.  VENTAJAS Y LIMITACIONES
30)  El aprovechamiento de los financiamientos concesionales y las donaciones
externas, estan en funci6n del tipo de proyecto que sera financiado. La FBE por su
concepcion, es con seguridad un modelo que obliga a tener sostenibilidad y por lo tanto
es un proyecto que obliga a que las contrapartes, en este caso el sector privado, asuma
responsabilidades y no se limite a la recepci6n de ayuda externa, o a la obtenci6n de
cr6ditos de fomento, las mismas que una vez agotadas no generan impactos positivos ni
Ia continuidacl del proyecto en el tiempo.
31)  En este sentido, el modelo FBE tiene ventajas en su estructura global, y las
limitaciones son menores y de orden operativo. Estas limitaciones pueden ser superadas
en el diseflo del proyecto, como por ejemplo incluyendo en la preparaci6n del proyecto a
quienes se haran cargo de su ejecuci6n posterior.
32)  En el orden estructural, la inversi6n en el sector agroexportador supone un proceso
amplio de investigaci6n previa y en general el sector productor/exportador no reditua
resultados en el corto plazo. Las exigencias del mercado externo y las limitaciones del
pals, en el orden de calidad del producto y su manejo post-produccion (transporte-
mercado) requieren de politicas publicas que incorpore la inversi6n en infraestructura. En
ese sentido, la FBE es un proyecto modesto, pero que jug6 un rol importante al tratar de
definir estrategias y generar impactos.
33)  La FBE trat6 de rescatar las experiencias de Fundaci6n Chile, por lo que visit6 a
dicha instituci6n y se adaptaron muchos de sus conceptos. No obstante a diferencia de
Fundaci6n Chile, la FBE no tenla un fondo fiduciario disponible que le permita generar
recursos desdle su inicio. Aun con esta limitaci6n, comprensible si tenemos en cuenta el



36
origen de los recursos de la FBE, la instituci6n muestra potencial y sostenibilidad
operativa en el tiempo.
UN EJEMPLO
-    La FBE realiz6 en 1995 inversiones en Sociedades Accidentales, las mismas que
estan previstas en el C6digo de Comercio y que constituyen "joint-venture" aut6nticos.
Esta experiencia era in6dita en el pals.
-    Estas Sociedades Accidentales que precisaban recursos para capital operativo, en
el caso concreto del sector de la castafia, tuvieron efectos positivos, sobre todo porque
son proyectos en los que la banca comercial no interviene, dado que la garantlas en la
regi6n amaz6nica no satisfacen a nuestro sistema financiero.
-    No obstante el exito que se obtuvo en estas sociedades, que tenian rendimientos
ripidos y relativamente altos, la FBE no pudo obtener de la AIF que estas sociedades
sean en todos los casos financiadas por nuevos desembolsos, habiendo por lo tanto, la
FBE utilizado sus recuperaciones y dividendos para replicar estas experiencias (ver
Anexo 2).
VII.  LECCIONES
34)  A la fecha, la FBE puede considerarse como el primer y unico fondo de capital de
riesgo en Bolivia. No obstante, no se ha podido lograr el desembolso del total de los
recursos originalmente comprometidos, debido a que entre otras causas, las areas de
acci6n de la FBE (agropecuaria y agroindustrial), son sectores de larga maduraci6n, bajos
retornos y altos riesgos.
35)  El hecho de haber invertido capital de riesgo, ha dado satisfactorios resultados
financieros en algunos casos y dificultades en otros. Sin embargo, de no haber priorizado
la inversi6n y postergado los proyectos piloto, los fondos no utilizados al 31 de diciembre
de 1997, con seguridad hubieran sido mucho mayores.
36)  Por la estructura de aplicaci6n de los recursos del Convenio de Cr6dito, estos son
destinados a: Inversiones; Gastos de Funcionamiento y Proyectos Piloto. Este esquema
esta concebido para generar la fuente de repago de los compromisos de la FBE, mediante
un sistema de inversi6n; captaci6n de rendimientos; desinversi6n e inversiones en
nuevos proyectos. Solo se ha cumplido este ciclo en las Sociedades Accidentales y
todavla no se ha iniciado con las Sociedades estables (Sociedades An6nimas).
37)  Las inversiones realizadas han tenido efectos positivos en el crecimiento y
diversificaci6n de las exportaciones; generaci6n de empleo; medio ambient. y
formalizaci6n de las empresas. (Ver Anexo 3).
38)  El hecho de no haber ampliado el proyecto y haber quedado un remanente de
dinero no desembolsado de US$.10.346.435 ( en gran parte recursos de donaci6n), en
primer termino representa un perjuicio para el pals y en relaci6n a la FBE debilita su



37
sostenibilidad institucional, ya que su actividad como Fondo de Capital de Riesgo, solo
podra continuar hasta que logre captar nuevos recursos financieros.
39)  Por todas las caracteristicas del Proyecto FBE, este tuvo una evoluci6n que sus
creadores no tenfan prevista, sin embargo y debido a su magnitud, sobretodo por ser
inedito en su genero para la AIF y el pals y estar orientado al sector agricola y
agroindustrial, ameritaba que se prevea un tiempo mayor a cinco afos, que es el tiempo
de vigencia del Acuerdo de Proyecto y Convenio de Cr6dito.
40)  Los proyectos de inversi6n con participaci6n de la FBE, que han entrado en un
proceso crftico en el orden financiero y legal, tienen como denominador comin la mala
calidad del socio y la gesti6n, factores que auln con evaluaciones exhaustivas esta fuera
de control. Otro factor que se identific6 en el fracaso de proyectos, fue el enfoque no
apropiado de los proyectos, los mismos que eran demasiado inmaduros en tema de
gesti6n y sobre todo de mercado para invertir en capital de riesgo y mas bien debieron
haber sido orientados como proyectos piloto.
41)  Requiere especial menci6n el proceso legal de desinversi6n, en la empresa
AMERICA S.A, beneficiadora de castafla, que por graves deficiencias de gesti6n
administrativa, ha determinado acciones que para la FBE fueron traumaticas. Este
proceso lievado adelante por la Gerencia de la FBE, cont6 en todo momento con el apoyo
del Banco Mundial y sin embargo de haber opacado la imagen de la instituci6n, tambi6n
ha servido como aviso de alerta y un precedente para gestores de otros proyectos que
consideran que los recursos aportados por la FBE, pueden ser distraidos.
Vll. PERSPECTIVAS
42)  Actualmente el Directorio de la FBE se encuentra analizando estrategias y
opciones para garantizar los objetivos y la continuidad de la FBE. Una vez que se ha
concluido la relaci6n con el Banco Mundial, las opciones institucionales que se estan
estudiando son la creaci6n de un ente mercantil (Sociedad An6nima) con participacion de
la FBE e instituciones financieras nacionales y extranjeras.
43)  Es necesario desde el punto de vista de la FBE, que continue la participaci6n de la
AIF, aun si este organismo ya no se constituye en fuente de financiamientos de la FBE.
Esta necesidad obedece a que se requiere de un paraguas que le permita mantener su
autonomla de gesti6n e imagen, tanto de la instituci6n como de sus empresas asociadas.
44)  Si bien el Proyecto de la FBE ha concluido para la AIF el 31/12/97, es importante
que los Gobiernos de Holanda y Suiza puedan analizar la continuidad del proyecto
otorgando para ello los fondos remanentes de sus donaciones al 31 de diciembre de
1997, y aun si esto no es posible, la presencia de estos financiadores en el seno del
Directorio, creemos que es de importancia para la FBE.
