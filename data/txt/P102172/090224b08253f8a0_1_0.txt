                         Some of Government's main achievements supported under the Project include increased access to family medicine providers, which resulted in an increase of primary care services
                         utilization from 2 to 3.1 outpatient visits per capita between 2009 and 2012. The share of family medicine visits in total visits was also increased from 35% to 38% from 2009 to 2012.
                         Since the implementation of the two-phased support to the Health Transformation Program, patient satisfaction with overall health services increased from 63.4 percent in 2009 to
                         74.8 percent in 2012.

                         After the approval of the Decree Law No. 663 on the Organization and Duties of the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Its Affiliates on November 3, 2011, the MOH completed its
                         restructuring till November 2012, which has further helped establish the legal basis for the reforms being supported by the Project by defining the stewardship role of the MOH,
                         increasing hospital autonomy, expanding family medicine services and further strengthening performance management and pay for performance initiatives. The MOH’s medium-term
                         strategic plan, covering the period from 2013 to 2017, confirms its commitment towards implementation of the reform program, and strengthens the basis for continued support under
                         the Project.

                         Undersecretariat of Treasury countersigned the amendment letter for the first level restructuring on May 21, 2015. After the completion of two-stage restructuring, the project is
                         expected to continue the recent acceleration in activities and efforts to consolidate the reform results. The revised PDO is achievable. The project is being streamlined with the
                         cancellation of components, disbursement has picked up and a new implementation plan is being finalized. The updated procurement plan with all activities has been cleared.

                         The reorganization process of the MOH was completed and the overall implementation capacity - including human resources management and fiduciary issues - of the MOH Project
                         Management Support Unit (PMSU) has been improved significantly.

                         In line with the considerable recovery in the implementation capacity and increased disbursement rate, the Implementation Progress rating of the Project is increased to Moderately
                         Satisfactory.
