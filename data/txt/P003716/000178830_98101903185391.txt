INTER11'ATIONAL DEVELOPI4ET ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO
THE EDXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A SECOND
HIGHW4AY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Indonesia in an amount in various currencies
equivalent to US$34 million on standard IDA terms for a second highway
project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        Indonesia has received fourteen IDA credits for a total amount
of US$178.4 million. The IDA program for Indonesia reflects the priorities
for rehabilitation and development established by the Government and fully
supported by the Bank Group. To support the Government's program for
increasing food production the Association has made several credits for
agriculture, mainly for the rehabilitation of irrigation systems and of
rubber and palm oil estates. These account for nearly half of IDA lending
for Indonesia, and for close to two-thirds if the Association's share in
the PUSRI fertilizer project is included. In addition, to facilitate rapid
rehabilitation in these sectors credits for highways, power, telecommuni-
cations and education have been made. In recognition of the urgent need
for institutional reforms, a number of IDA projects have included major
steps to reorganize existing institutions or establish new ones. At the
same time, to supplement the Government's efforts in improving admini-
stration and management each credit has included provision for consultant
services and technical assistance. A summary statement of IDA credits
and IFC investments is at Annex I.
3.        In addition, two technical assistance credits have been made to
finance part of the cost of pre-investment studies undertaken by the
Government during the last two years. These studies are now helping
to establish investment priorities over a wide range of activities, and
as a result, it is becoming possible to consider project aid in priority
fields not yet assisted. The Association's plans for FY72 take such
possibilities into account. While there is provision for further lending
for irrigation rehabilitation, highways, power distribution and education,
projects are also being considered in six new fields: family planning,
development finance, marine transport, smallholder rubber, industrial
estates and tourism. Each involves difficult issues and new administra-
tive problems, and not all may be ready for the Executive Directorst
consideration in the next fiscal year. In any event, the IDA allocation
for Indonesia may not suffice to cover all. Special emphasis is being






placed, however, on the family planring and development finance projects
which are being appraised in June and September respectively. Each
wiould represent an important step in the institution-building process
and, as with most IDA credits, could set the stage for additional aid
to these sectors from bilateral donors.
4.        The first IDA credit to Indonesia was made in September 1968
and nine of the fourteen credits have been made since June 1, 1970. As
project authorities were unfamiliar with the Association's procedures
and requirements there have been initial delays on some projects. The
implementation of the first and second Agricultural Estates Projects
(Credits 155-IND and 194-IID) has been delayed, mainly due to problems
of organization; progress is being made and the problems are gradually
being resolved. Disbursements from Credit 155-IND are behind schedule,
but the position is expected to improve soon since contracts have been
awarded for US$4.1 million against which no disbursements have yet been
made. Credit 194-IND was made effective on February 9, 1971 and dis-
bursements are expected to start shortly. Progress in executing the
first Highway Project (Credit 15h-IND) is satisfactory even though
disbursements are lower than forecast at appraisal. The major items
of equipment are now being delivered, after some delays due to un-
familiarity with the Association's procurement procedures, and dis-
bursements are expected to speed up. The Third Irrigation Rehabili-
tation Project (Credit 220-IND) was declared effective on Play 28, 1971
and disbursement will start shortly. The Seeds Project (Credit 246-IND)
was approved by the Board on May 11 and has not yet been declared
effective. After a slow start disbursements on the balance of the
credits are now satisfactory.  As of May 31, 1971, of a total commit-
ment of US$178.4 million, US$161.9 million remained undisbursed. The
improving disbursement situation is evidenced by the fact that of the
total disbursement of US$16.5 million, US$7.8 million has occured
during the months of April and May. The pace of disbursements is
likely to quicken further.
PART II - THE ECON0OiY
5.        The Indonesian economy is still recovering from the damage,
physical and institutional, caused by years of mismanagement, hyper-
inflation and civil unrest during the latter years of the Sukarno
regime. Initially the Soeharto Government was forced to concentrate
on immediate objectives: halting inflation, increasing food produc-
tion, rehabilitating infrastructure, attracting foreign investment
and promoting primary exports, particularly minerals and estates crops.
6.        The stabilization has not only brought prices under control
but has also succeeded in establishing an environment conducive to
development. Among measures taken to remove controls and open the






economy to market forces has been the progressive simplification of the
exchange system which is now virtually free of controls. A selective
credit policy has encouraged production from existing capacity and, more
recently, investment in new capacity. A new foreign investment law has
encouraged the inflow of private capital and has been complemented by
a domestic investment law with similar provisions. External and internal
balance has been maintained and, wihere necessary, reinforced by measures
such as the introduction in 1970 of a price support policy which appears
to have had substantial effects on rice production.
7.        A special economic report (EAP-22), prepared for the April
1971 meeting of the Inter-Governmental Group for Indonesia (IGGI), was
distributed to the Executive Directors on April 16, 1971. This report
bears evidence of the continued economic improvement described in more
detail in the last full economic report on Indonesia (EAP-19a of
November 27, 1970). Economic and social data are contained in Annex II.
IJhile reliable statistics are scarce, economic progress is evident in
the marked increased in the production of textiles and other manufactured
goods, in accelerated construction activities and in continuing export
growth. Exports, led by oil, were 15 percent higher in 1970/71 than
in the previous year in spite of lower prices for rubber. Rice pro-
duction appears to have increased by over 5 percent in each of the
last two years and foodgrains imports, which have been approaching a
million tons annually, could be substantially lower this year. The
available data on production, investment and imports indicate a growth
in GDP in 1970/71 of approximately 8 percent.
8.        The Government has a Five-Year Development Plan (1969-7h)
which appropriately reflects the short-term needs of the economy and is
being   implemented as a series of annual programs.   Highest priority
is assigned to agriculture for both food production and export crops.
Special emphasis is also placed on the rehabilitation of infrastructure,
including transport and communications, power and irrigation systems.
Programs covering the more urgent needs for physical rehabilitation
have been drawn up, substantial external aid has been committed, and
many of the works are in progress. More attention is now being given
to new construction. In addition, the Government's energies are being
directed increasingly to other major development problems, including
the population pressures on Java and Bali, the requirements of the
social sectors and the needs for regional balance in development.
9.        Among the most serious and urgent problems at present, for
the public sector as a whole, are those resulting from the deteriora-
tion of the administrative system and of its public institutions and
agencies under the previous regime. The first steps towards the re-
organization of the civil service have recently been taken and suggest
a growing determination to make progress in this difficult field.
Action is also underway to increase the efficiency and viability of
some state enterprises, but there is still scope for considerable
improvement.

10.       Bank Group assistance to Indonesia is part of the international
support being given in increasing amounts through the Inter-Governmental
Group for Indonesia. Commitments of aid have risen from $200 million of
program aid in 1967 to over $600 million in all forms of aid for 1971/72.
The proportion of project aid has increased over this period, but substan-
tial program aid remains essential for balance of payments support and,
in spite of the strong domestic revenue efforts, as a supplement to rupiah
resources for the development budget. IGGI project aid commitments from
1968 to M4arch 31, 1971 armounted to $584 million, of which IDA credits to
that date accounted for $171 million (29 percent) and the Asian Development
Bank for $24 million.
11.       Following the rescheduling arrangements for pre-1966 external
debt, which culminated in April 1970 in agreement on a long-term settlement
of the debts held by Western creditors and Japan, and the subsequent
separate agreement on similar lines with the USSR, the ratio of external
debt service to exports is currently low. It will rise appreciably
throughout the 1970ts, however, as grace periods expire on aid received
after 1966, but should remain manageable during the decade and beyond
if good export performance continues and if new aid remains available
on terms similar to those at present obtained from the IGGI. All aid
from the IGGI donors has been given on concessional terms approaching
the standards set by the DAC; Australia's aid, and half that of the
Netherlands has been in grant form. Several other countries have
recently further softened their loan terms.  Consistently with this
pattern, the Bank Group's assistance to Indonesia (aside from IFC
invesuments) has so far been provided exclusively in the form of IDA
credits.
12.       With recovery so recent, the longer-term prospects of the
economy, including its aid requirements and the possible external debt
trends, cannot yet be adequately assessed. Nor, because no adequate
employment and income distribution data are available, is it yet possible
to assess the social impact, although it has been clearly favorable,
of the recent return to stability and the increase in production and
investment. The national elections scheduled for July 3 are a further
sign of the return to mnore normal conditions. They appear unlikely
to result in any major change in the economic policies which have
proved so effective since 1966.
13.       The most recent economic report (EAP-22) takes a first look
at longer-term economic perspectives. It suggests that satisfactory
economic progress is possible in Indonesia over the next decade, pro-
vided that during the period the annual inflow of external resources,
public and private, is substantially in excess of the 1970/71 level
of nearly $600 million, including a public capital inflow of $400 million.
This tentative conclusion assumes a continuation of sound economic
policies and of present efforts to use efficiently the internal and
external resources available.

PART III - THE? TRiANSPORT SECTOR
14.       Indonesia is an archipelago of more than 3,000 islands,
stretching 5,000 km along the equator. Conseq-uently, marine trans-
port serve as tne miajor trunk system while roads and railways link
the interiors of islands to their ports and provide for internal
transport needs. Air traffic is still very small. As generally in
Indonesia, reliable information for the sector is very scarce. Few
reliable data on the distribution of traffic by mode, general trans-
port costs or charges are available.
15.       The current Five-Year Development Plan (1969-74) includes
a Rp 100 billion (US$260 million) investment target for roads and
road transport -- the sector where rehabilitation needs are most
urgent -- Rp 33 billion (US$87 million) for railways, Rp 46 billion
(US$122 million) for marine transport, and Rp 21 billion (US$56
million) for aviation. The allocation among modes was prepared
without adequate information and is only a rough framework.   Current
trends indicate that actual investments for the whole sector over
the Five-Year Plan period are likely to be close to the original
target of Rp 200 billion, but that there may be substantial depar-
tures from the original allocations among modes in view of the
knowledge and experience accumulated since the basic Plan was
formulated.
16.       Project and budget preparation for highwzay construction
originate in the Directorate-General of Highways in the iinistry of
Public W,1orks and Power;  for other modes they originate in the
Directorates-General of Sea Communications, Alviation, and Land Transport
in the Kinistry of Communications.  The project proposals are re-
viewed by planning bureaus of these NoIinistries and subsequently by
the Communications and Infrastructure Division of the National Planning
Council (BAPPEENAS), which is responsible for determining the total
investment budget for the sector.  However, the original presentations
are such that comparisons of projects even within one transport mode
are difficult.  Neither the N1inistries nor the Planning Council has
adequate staff to prepare or evaluate inves-tment proposals, and foreign
experts from the UiDP-financed Transport Coordination Advisory Services
(TCAS) are being used for tl-is p1arpose.
17.       Urgent requirements of project identification and preparation
in the transport agencies are being met by technical assistance. The
UNDP is financing consulting services to assist the Government's
highway agency in determining investment priorities and planning an
efficient highway organization. The Association is financing technical
support services, as a follow-up to the UNDP-financed services, to
assist and advise on highway planning and on execution of highway re-
habilitation and maintenance programs. The Netherlands Government, is






- 6 -
providing technical assistance in inter-island shipping and is financing
consulting services for port rehabilitation and dredging. The Belgian
Governrment is providing an inland waterway survey team. A consulting
team from the Federal Republic of GermaMry is assisting the railways.
The Canadian Government is expected to begin technical assistance in
aviation in 1971 to complement the on-going assistance from the
Netherlands Government to the national flag carrier, Garuda.   These
technical assistance teams are improving project preparation in the
agencies, but pro-ress in training local personnel is slow.   It is
likely that continued technical assistance will be required in the
foreseeable future.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
18.       This project, which is considered critical to Sumatra's develop-
ment, entails a major investment outside the island of Java and reflects
the growing importance attached by the Government to regional balance in
Indonesia s development. The importance of this consideration is also
underscored by inclusion in this project of financinr for a study whnich
is to lead to formulation of a regional development program for the
influence area of the highway. The proposed project represents the
first stage of a program to rehabilitate and irmprove the trunk road
linking Medan in the north of Sumatra wTith Telukbetung in the south.
The rehabilitation of this artery was assigned highest priority among
development oriented highway investments by UNDP consultants under a
study for wihich the Bank is executing agency. The same consultants
also identified the 50O km central portion of this artery (the
Sawatambang-Muarabungo-Lubuklinggau section) as being most urgently
in need of rehabilitation. This project makes provision for construc-
tion of the first 200 km section of that highway. The main features
of the proposed credit and the project are suxmmarized in Annex III,
which also includes maps.
19.       More specifically the project comprises:
(a) construction to two-l-mne paved standards of about
200 km of a national highway between Sawatambang
and M4uarabungo and supervision by consultants;
(b) detailed engineering of an extension, about 300 Ilm
long, of the national highway be-tween I4uarabungo
and Lubuklinggau;
(c)  a regional study of the area served by the Sawatambang-
Muarabungo-Lubuklinggau national highway and subsequent
detailed engineering of ahout 500 km of feeder roads
in that area; and
(d)  detailed engineering of about 700 km of a national
highway between Padang and Medan and of sorme 500 km
of related feeder roads.






20.       Detailed engineering for the Sawatambang-Muarabungo section
has been completed under Credit 216-111D (Second Technical Assista-re
Project) followring a UNDP-financed feasibility study. Originally the
detailed engineering of the portion between 1luarabungo and Lubuklinggau
was also to have been financed under Credit 216-DID, but has now been
included in this project in order to conserve Credit 216-IND funds for
other high priority studies. Arrangements are being made to have the
feasibility study for the Medan-Padang portion financed out of unutilized
funds in the UNDP Highwiay Assistance and Transport Coordination Studies -
a project designed to assist the Government in planning the country's
transport sector - wJith cost overruns, if any, to be financed by
Credit 216-IND.
21.       As already emphasized, there is a continuing need in Indonesia
to improve the data base for formulation of a comprehensive and rational
transport policy.  Therefore, in conjunction with this project, the
Goverrment has undertaken to carry out a comprehensive national study
of the levels and distribution of road user charges and to continue and
expand traffic counting to include selective counts by vehicle type.
22.       The total cost of the project (including contingencies) is
estimated at $49 million, including a foreign exchange component of $34
million (approximately 70 percent of the total cost) which is to be
financed by the proposed credit. Approximately US$27 million of the
total foreign exchange cost is for construction, including supervision
by consultants and contingencies. The balance represents consultants'
costs in carr-ying out the detailed engineering of the Muarabungo-
Lubuklinggau and Medan-Padang sections and associated feeder roads,
and the regional study of the area served by the Sawatambang-Muarabungo-
Lubuklinggau national highway. Funds from the credit Trill be disbursed
on the basis of 65 percent of the cost of highway construction, equal
to the estimated foreign exchange component thereof, and actual foreign
exchange cost of consultants' services. The Government will cover the
local currency expenditures equivalent to US$15 million.
23.       The Directorate-General of Highways, assisted by qualified
consultants, will be responsible for executing the project. The
Directorate, which is part of the Ministry of Public lorks and Power,
is also responsible for executing the highway rehabilitation project
financed under Credit 154-IMD, and hence is familiar with the Associationts
procedures. Consequently, the delays experienced with that project are
not expected in this one.
24.       The construction portion of the project will be carried out
by contractors, and bidding for construction will be in accordance writh
the Association's guidelines for international competitive bidding. The
civil works will be grouped into bid packages of sufficient value to
attract widespread international competition. Since construction programs
have been small in recent years, grow-ith of local contractors has been
inhibited. There are no local contractors capable of undertaking the
major hir-hway construction involved in this project. The Government,
however, plans to encourage the participation of local contractors in
future projects, which will include considerable feeder road construction.






- 8 -
25.       The area where actual construction is to take place was
relatively well developed before Wiorld W,Jar II but has now been re-
duced to scattered subsistence farming, mainly as a result of the
continued deterioration of the road network.   With the new road, a
rehabilitation of primary production should be possible through the
opening up of new areas for agriculture and forestry and the lowering
of transport costs for the region's exports. IJhile the construction
portion of the proposed project is fully justified on the basis of
immediately identifiable benefits, the re-jional study is expected
to point the way towuard maximizing the highway's impact upon the region.
26.       Population density is low and unemployment is not a serious
problem in the project area.  Construction by labor-intensive methods
is therefore not practicable. As development in the project area
gets undernay this area will become increasingly attractive to po-ten-
tial mi,rants from crowded Java. At that time labor-intensive
methods will become increasingly feasible.   It is unlikely, however,
that sizeable migration into this area will take place prior to
completion of the regional study included in this project and the
subsequent drawing up of a development pro7ram.
27.       The immediately identifiable benefits from the highway
construction are: (a) savings in transport costs; (b) development
induced by the new road (i.e. value added in production of rubber,
rice and timber).  Using these benefits, the most likely rate of
return is 19 percent.  Sensitivity analysis suggests that even with
the worst possible combination of consequences the rate of return
would not fall below 12 percent and could, under more favorable asswup-
tions, be as high as 26 percent. None of these calculations makes
allowance for the increased benefits that would be realized through
implementation of the findings of the regional development study for
which financing is provided in the proposed credit. The project is
not expected to give rise to any serious ecological problems.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUI1ENT2S AND AIUTHORITY
28.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic
of Indonesia and the Association, the recommendation of the Committee
referred to in Article V section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of
the Association, and the text of a draft resolution approving the
proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft Development Credit Agreement is in the usual
form for this type of project.
29.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECC1EIiE.-TD.TTOIT
30.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
