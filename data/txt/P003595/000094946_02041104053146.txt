3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The objective of the project was to increase production and productivity over a wide area of degraded red
soils in the provinces of Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, Zhejiang, and the Guangxi Autonomous Region; to help
alleviate poverty by increasing the income of currently underemployed farmers; and to benefit the
environment by improving soil and water conservation, reducing erosion and promoting sustainable land
use and agricultural practices.
These objectives were in line with the Government's long-term strategies and policies for the agricultural
sector as formulated in the early nineties which sought to increase production to meet the requirements
created by population growth and to increase income and employment in rural areas. In addition, the
objective supported the Bank Group's agricultural sector strategy, as defined in the 1993 CAS, to promote
sustainable agricultural development in impoverished and environmentally vulnerable areas and increase
and diversify agricultural production. The objectives of the project were clear and well-formulated. They
were well designed, consistent with Borrower's and Bank Group's overall strategy at the time of
preparation, and supported by the project's stakeholders.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The original project objectives remained unchanged.
3.3 Original Components:
The project design focused on the transformation of degraded wasteland and semi-wasteland into a
productive, sustainable agricultural resource. It built largely on the experience gained under the first 'Red
Soils Area Development Project' (Credit 1733-CHA) and centered around a comprehensive development of
micro-watersheds with integrated land development, infrastructure, crop and livestock development,
buildings, machinery, rural energy, research, training and TA. In addition to this watershed development
part of the project, an agro-processing component was designed to utilize and add value to the output of
farmers assisted by the project and to increase employment. Specifically, the project had the following 11
original components:
(1) Land Development (costs including contingencies US$41.27 million - 13.9% of total). This
component lays the foundation of the micro-watershed development by developing land both, on the slopes,
mainly through terracing and soil conservation measures, and in the valleys, through the improvement of
drainage of paddy fields. The component planned for 22,229 ha of new terrace development and 2,498 ha
of terrace rehabilitation, including 21,647 ha of grass/soil conservation measures. In addition, 10,712 ha of
paddy rehabilitation plus some bamboo and fishpond development were included.
(2) Infrastructure Development (US$32.22 million - 10. 9%). This component was focusing on irrigation
for both, upland fields and orchards and lowland paddy fields. The construction of storage facilities such as
small reservoirs and ponds, as well as raising of small dams, pumping stations, distribution systems such as
pipes and canals, and sprinkler are part of the construction plan. Specifically, the component included the
improvement of about 10,700 ha of existing paddy land, and the provision of dry-season irrigation for
about 23,700 ha of upland orchards, and fodder and other annual field crops. In addition to the irrigation
infrastructure, the component aimed at meeting the additional power requirement for irrigation,
agro-processing and domestic lighting by installing transmission lines, and at linking project sites to the
existing network of paved country roads by constructing and upgrading about 1,036 km of all-weather
gravel roads (class IV standards).
In September 2001, about SDR8.052 million of the Credit were allocated to a new 'Inner Mongolia Snowstorm Emergency Recovery Component'
(IMSERC) (see Chapter 10). This Component is still under implementation and not part of this ICR.

(3) Buildings (US$24.24 million - 8.2%). About 623,600 square meters of buildings (excluding those for
agro-processing) were planned under this component. This included farmsteads for new settlers (22%),
offices, workshops, storage and warehouses, and service and extension centers (16%), and buildings for
pigs and other livestock (64%).
(4) Machinery and Vehicles (US$14.33 million - 4.8%). This component was designed to provide
vehicles to supplement existing fleets to meet the expected demand for transporting project inputs and
agricultural produce, including 204 trucks of 5- to 8-ton capacity, 304 trucks of 1.5- to 2-ton capacity and
some insulated or refrigerated vans and milk tankers. The design also included the provision of small farm
machinery such as two-wheel tractors and power pesticide foggers to specialized contractor households.
(5) Crop Establishment (US$92.80 million - 31.3%). This component was designed to provide complete
crop establishments in all parts of the micro-watershed under development. About 16,464 ha of fruit trees
were planned, most of which peach and plum, citrus (including rehabilitation), chestnut, and longan, lychee
and ginkgo. This area was also used for inter-cropping at the early stage of implementation when trees were
still sufficiently small. In addition, the component design included 3,353 ha planted to tea, mulberry or
grapes, 10,712 ha of improved paddy on the drained fields in the valleys, 13,755 ha of forests (mostly
Chinese fir and Masson pine), and 1,143 ha of bamboo, plus some seedling nurseries and crops
establishment on up-land area.
(6) Livestock and Aquatic Development (US$43.74 million - 14.8%). The development of livestock and
aquatic production is a crucial part of the comprehensive watershed development and was fully integrated
with the other components by making the number of livestock supported by the project dependent on the
requirements for animal manure in the development area and on the need to provide cash income for project
farmers, in particular early in the project phase when tree crops do yet not provide yields. Specifically, the
component planned the financing of 20,579 breeding pigs and about 410 thousand fattening pigs, about 210
thousand chicken and 236 thousand ducks and geese, and some 759 cows for specialized dairy households
in Jiangxi and Zhejiang. In addition, 765 ha of new and 91 ha of rehabilitated fishponds were included.
(7) Rural Energy (US$2.87 million - 1.0%). Under this component the financing of 9,970 biodigesters
and 24,540 improved stoves was planned in order to make efficient use of the animal manure produced
under the project.
(8) Agro-processing (US$31.57 million - 10.7%). 18 agro-processing sub-projects were planned under
this component, including seven fruit processing and one bamboo and fruit pulp plant, one tea plant, two
cold stores, one cannery, one flavone plant, one silk weaving and one silk reeling plant, two feedmills, and
one wholesale market. Financing plans included land, buildings, equipment, provision for waste treatment,
vehicles, and about 3,781 person months of local training for workers and staff.
(9) Research (US$2.45 million - 0.8%). This component was designed to support research (including
some research equipment) carried out by local research institutes and coordinated by the Technical
Committees. Proposed topics included soil fertility, sustainable agricultural systems, watershed
management including irrigation and water management, Integrated Pest Management (IPM),
agro-forestry, orchard management and post-harvest treatment, animal husbandry and aquaculture.
(10) Training and TA (US$6.45 million - 2.2%). In order to build a stronger capacity for beneficiaries
and project staff, this component provided support for local and overseas training, study tours, and
institutional development TA comprising both foreign and local consultants. Specifically, about 40% of all
participating households, and in particular women, were to be trained for a total of 20,255 person months.
The component also included a total of 1,076 person months of training of agro-technical staff from
townships and counties, 151 person months of higher level training, and 375 person months of long-term
-3 -



domestic and 105 person months of long-term foreign training. Moreover, 211 person months of study
tours and 118 months of TA were planned.
(11) Project Management (US$4.37 million - 1.5%). A project management structure was designed with
implementation responsibility for the Governments of the participating provinces, guiding and supervising
responsibility by Ministiy of Agriculture, and financial responsibility by Ministry of Finance. Project
management included Project Leading Groups (PLGs) and Project Management Offices (PMOs) at central,
provincial, city, county, and township level, and Technical Committees (TCs) at central, provincial, city,
and county level.
The components of the project were clearly linked to the objectives described above, and adequate for their
achievements. They were well designed, building upon each other, and with detailed and practical technical
standards. The relatively high degree of complexity of the project, which was necessary for a successful
watershed development, took into account the capacity of project management. For this reason the
implementing agency was a different institutional set-up than that in the precursor (first) Red Soils Area
Development Project.
3.4 Revised Components:
The design of the red soils area development was well prepared and remained largely unchanged throughout
the implementation period (except for IMSERC, see Chapter 10). However, mainly due to favorable
exchange rate developments, availability of project funds for implementation, in real terms, exceeded
appraisal estimates substantially and the scope of the project was extended by increasing the number of
project watersheds by 49 and expanding 16 out of the original 217 watersheds. Consequently, output
indicators of all micro-watershed development components substantially exceed appraisal estimates. At the
same time some smaller adjustments in the relative importance of components and activities took place, e.g.
the increase in the share of citrus and the number of livestock and the reduction in mulberry trees,
chestnuts, and some other sub-activities. While a number of agro-processing plants were cancelled during
implementation, mainly due to changes in market conditions, the total costs of this component actually
increased because of higher prices of construction works and equipment purchased and because of the
expansion of those sub-projects that were implemented.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at Entry is rated satisfactory, based on the strength of (i) consistency of project objective with the
Bank's long-term strategies and the Government's policies for agricultural and rural development and
poverty reduction; (ii) a project design which incorporated valuable lessons learned and experiences from
other Bank-financed watershed development projects and, in particular, the first Red Soils Area
Development Project, including a greater emphasize on risks management and project sustainability; (iii)
innovative and sound project design including excellent technical specifications and a thorough economic
analysis; (iv) strong Borrower ownership; and (v) the Bank's safeguard policies being adequately addressed
in project design.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The project's objectives and outputs were substantially achieved. Agricultural production and productivity
over a wide area of degraded red soils increased considerably.
Household survey data indicates that the output value in real terms of participating farm households almost
doubled from 1994 to 2000 and exceeded that of nonparticipating households by about 30% at the end of
the implementation period. Before the project, paddy yields in the valleys of the small watersheds were very
low and no production took place on the sloped areas; in 2000, crop yields in the project area exceeded
- 4 -



those outside by more than 25% for most crops.
The project further increased farmers' income and employment and alleviated poverty by directly improving
the living standards of 68,373 beneficiary households or approximately 400,000 people. Given the
expansion of the project area, the project could have benefited even more households. However, the figure
exceeds the appraisal estimate (67,000 households). The average annual per-capita net income of these
beneficiaries, measured in 2000 prices, increased substantially from about 1,200 Yuan in 1994 to about
2,450 Yuan at the end of the project; and this income also exceeded that of non-beneficiaries by about 20%
(see Annex 1). Other measures of living standards were also improved, including access to training,
information, transport, and other resources. Employment increased in virtually all beneficiary households
and also beyond this group since the increased economic activity created employment outside the project
area, in particular in the down-stream sectors. Women benefited substantially from the project. Their
involvement in project activities was very high as the demand for their skills and labor in project
implementation was great. In addition, some farmers in those villages from which beneficiaries moved into
newly developed watersheds benefited indirectly by the freeing-up of resources. The overall financial and
economic Net Present Value (NPV) of the project is positive (see Chapter 4.3), though less than the
appraisal estimate, which is partly due to some output prices being lower than assumed at appraisal and the
a severe frost in 1999/2000.
The environmental impact of the project has also been very positive, primarily as a result of increased
forest coverage and the successful introduction of soil and water conservation measures on slope land.
Reduction in soil loss has been confirmed in the findings of Agro-Environmental Monitoring Stations in the
project provinces, ranging from 24% in a sample watershed in Jiangxi to 78% in one in Guangxi (see
Annex 1).
4.2 Outputs by components:
(1) Land Development (US$44.8 million actual). The component is rated satisfactory. Achievement of
physical targets is high; and the significance of sound land preparation practices for agricultural
development has been widely recognized and adopted, even beyond the project area. About 25,750 ha of
sloped land have been newly terraced and about 3,370 ha of terraces have been rehabilitated. These figures
exceed the original plan by 15% and 23%, respectively. Additional soil conservation measures taken
include the planting of vetiver grass, day lily or other deep-rooted plants to protect terrace lips from
erosion. Generally, terracing and trenching have been executed satisfactorily. Other land development
works include paddy rehabilitation, mainly drainage improvement (11,667 ha, 109% of SAR), construction
of fishponds (202 ha, 231 % of SAR), and land development for bamboo (2,515 ha, 202% of SAR).
(2) Infrastructure Development (US$36.9 million). The component is rated satisfactory. At project
completion supplemental irrigation facilities have been provided for 37,457 ha, predominantly under
orchards, exceeding appraisal target (34,417 ha) by 9%. The need to irrigate up-land orchards has been
successfully introduced under the project and is now accepted as standard watershed development practice.
This is a substantial achievement despite the fact that the performance of the irrigation systems, measured
in terms of adequacy of water delivery and on-farm water distribution, varies among watersheds within and
across provinces. Moreover, operation and maintenance including irrigation cost recovery was addressed
during project implementation, and water charges appear sufficient to cover the cost of operation and
maintenance. Roads constructed under the project total 1,465 kni, exceeding the appraisal target by 49%.
(3) Buildings (US$31.7 million). The component is rated highly satisfactory. Some 860,000 square
meters of building construction, comprising mainly farm housing and pig sheds, were completed under the
project, 40% more than planned. Farm housing accounts for 23% and pig sheds for 63%. About 3,280
farm families, 50% more than estimated at appraisal, were settled in the watersheds, mostly in Jiangxi. Pig
- 5-



sheds can accommodate over half-a-million pigs. Construction quality is generally good, with technical
standards often exceeded. In some watersheds, larger structures such as warehouses and workshops were
over-designed, and, consequently, are under-utilized.
(4) Machinery and Vehicles (US$11.1 million). The component is rated satisfactory. 269 pick-up trucks
and 185 trucks up to 8 tons of capacity (29 and 40 more than planned, respectively) as well as 116
motorcycles were financed by the project. While the pick-up trucks and the motorcycles were used mainly
by the project management offices, most of the trucks, as well as about 1,130 hand-held tractors were
purchased and operated by specialist contract households. Some of the smaller farm machinery planned
under the project was not purchased. In summary, physical targets were largely met and the trucks and
tractors provided valuable means for transportation and production, not only for the household(s) owning
the vehicle, but also for neighboring farmers who contracted the services of these farmers.
(5) Crop Establishment (US$92.7 million). The component is rated satisfactory. Almost all physical
targets have been exceeded. About 20,768 ha of fruit trees have been established under the project, 26%
more than planned at appraisal. Growth and vitality of most plantations are highly satisfactory. In fact,
most fruit trees have generated yields earlier than expected at appraisal. In some orchards the tree
populations are excessive and this is likely to shorten the productive life of the fruit trees. Another problem
is that some areas planted with citrus or other sub-tropical fruits suffered severe frost damage in the winter
of 1999/2000. However, considerable efforts have been undertaken to rehabilitate these plantations,
including replanting worth US$4.2 million. Paddy yields on the improved lowland fields increased
substantially. In many cases, the production cycle increased from one to two harvests. Other crop
establishment activities include tea (1,504 ha new tea, 95% of SAR; and 579 ha tea rehabilitation, 127%),
forests (15,280 ha, 111%) and bamboo (3,024 ha, 265%), orchard inter-cropping (17,124 ha, 122%),
various annual crops on irrigated or non-irrigated upland (6,233 ha, 109%), and seedling nurseries (96 ha,
117%).
(6) Livestock and Aquatic Development (US$49.6 million). The component is rated highly satisfactory.
Physical targets have been exceeded substantially. Some initial reluctance regarding the stocking rate set
under the project was quickly overcome. The economic benefits, especially important at the early
implementation stage, as well as the very positive effect of manure to increase the organic content of
degraded soils, has been widely recognized and integrated livestock and crop production is applied beyond
the project areas. By the end of the project 578 thousand fattening pigs, 27 thousand breeding pigs, 748
thousand chicken, and 361 thousand geese and ducks have been financed, exceeding the original plan by
33% to 256% respectively.
(7) Rural Energy (US$3.1 million). The component is rated highly satisfactory. More than 12,000 biogas
digesters and more than 27,700 improved stoves were financed under the project, exceeding SAR figures
by 21% and 11%, respectively. The use of biogas digesters is a cheap and simple method of producing
energy from renewable resources, leading to a cleaner environment and reduction of other energy sources.
The component has successfully introduced the use of this technology on a large scale.
(8) Agro-processing (US$45.0 million). The component is rated unsatisfactory. Of the 18 sub-projects
planned at appraisal 4 were never realized, 5 were dropped after some initial investments, and 2 have
suspended production, mainly because of strong market competition, a relatively small scale of operation
and weak management. Of the remaining 7 sub-projects, only the Jinhua Frozen Fruits and Vegetables
Plant in Zhejiang can be regarded as being entirely successful in terms of its economic profitability and its
impact on local farmers. The Hangzhou wholesale market, though loss-making in previous years, is likely
to become profitable, and has provided some additional market channel and information to beneficiary
farmers. However, agricultural products from the project areas constitute only a very small part of the
products traded in the market. The two feedmill sub-projects are only partially successful, running on only
- 6 -



about half of their capacity. They are profitable but in a vulnerable financial position, and have limited
impact on farmers. Yushan Silk Weaving Factory in Jiangxi faces serious problems in marketing their
products and, despite having made some profits, is also in a vulnerable financial position. Finally, 2 plants
are still not operational at implementation completion.
(9) Research (US$1.8 million). The component is rated satisfactory. Research results were widely
disseminated and the project has benefited from the introduction of improved varieties of citrus and other
fruit resulting from the work carried out at provincial research institutes and plant breeding stations. The
research results have become an important basis for the further sustainable development of red soils
watersheds.
(10) Training and TA (US$7.7 million). The component is rated satisfactory. Training represents a
crucial element of the project, and considerable more domestic training and study tours have been financed
under the project than originally planned. About 815 thousand person time of training at the farm,
township, county, and provincial level were given in during the implementation period, about 47% higher
than the SAR figure. Training has been highly valued by project farmers and staff.
(11) Project Management (US$4.4 million SAR - US$7.3 million actual). The component is rated
satisfactory. Please refer to the discussion of the borrower's performaance in Section 7.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The economic rate of return for the watershed development part of the project (Components I to 7, 9 and
10) is estimated at 19%. This is lower than the 24% estimated at appraisal, the main reasons for which are
(i) substantial decline in some agricultural output prices, e.g. prices of lychee and longan plummeted by
more than 40 percent in real terms, (ii) losses due to the frost damage of the 1999/2000 winter, and (iii) a
substantial increase in labor costs, from 8 Yuan/day at SAR to 15 Yuan at ICR (2001 prices).
Nevertheless, an economic return on the investments of 19% is still substantial. A comparison of ERRs by
project province is shown below.
Fujian    Guangxi       Hunan       Jiangxi    Zhejiang   Total Project
ERR at ICR        20%        18%          17%         19%         17%          19%

Following the approach used at appraisal, the economnic analysis did not include the agro-processing
component, which accounted for 13% percent of total project costs. However, separate economic analysis
have been carried out for four out of five agro-enterprises which were operational at the end of project
implementation. ERR vary between 10% for the Hangzhou Wholesale Market and 17% for the Jinhua
Frozen Fruits and Vegetables Plant. These four enterprises account for 62% of all investments made under
the component. The returns on those enterprises which have either suspended their production or have not
yet entered into operation as well as that for Hengyang Feedmill where no reliable data could be obtained, is
difficult to quantify (30.6% of total), but the aggregate NPV is highly likely to be negative. Investments that
were made into plants that were abandoned before completion did not generate any return (3.5% of total
investments).

4.4 Financial rate of return:
The financial profitability of watershed development program is generally satisfactory at the household
level, as shown by various crop budgets and activity models (see project files), and at aggregated provincial
level as outlined in the table below. FRR values are lower than their SAR estimnates due to the reasons
provided in Chapter 4.3, but still quite high.

The financial rate of return of the investments made under the agro-processing component is low. Of the
18 agro-processing sub-projects approved in 1994, 9 were dropped outright or after some initial
investments. 2 enterprises stopped production due to unprofitable operations and financial difficulties and 2
others were not yet operational at the time of implementation completion. A financial analysis has been
carried out for 4 of the remaining 5 sub-projects which are currently in operation have been calculated. The
IRR is positive, ranging from 10% to 17%. However, the financial position of several enterprises is
vulnerable.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The institutional development impact of the project is positive and substantial. The project has also
increased the institutional capacity of the various Government agencies involved in the comprehensive
watershed development including Water Conservancy, Agriculture and Livestock Bureaus. Staff at all
levels has acquired valuable experience in land use planning and implementation. The integrated watershed
management approach has strengthened linkages among various Government agencies responsible for
agricultural and rural development. Through the support of research as well as a substantial amount of
training the project helped farmers to improve the management of their resources. Close linkages between
farmers, agricultural extension worker and researchers were established. Institution building under the
agro-processing component was generally ineffective with weak management and ownership structures in a
number of enterprises.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Decline in major agricultural output prices. China continued its market liberalization throughout the
project implementation period and most prices of agricultural commodities have been driven by market
forces. The decline in international prices of major agricultural outputs, in particular those of fruits and
meats, had a substantial negative influence on the project outcome.
Natural disasters. Natural disasters including flooding and frost occurred during project implementation
and affected implementation and outcome negatively. The exceptionally harsh frost in the winter of
1999/2000 had the most damaging impact. It caused widespread damage of citrus and other sub-tropical
fruit trees and reduced yields significantly. Project implementation was somewhat delayed and project
outcome was adversely affected in the short-run.
- 8 -



5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The influence of factors subject to government control has been largely positive. With its continuous
market-oriented reforms, both at the macro- and at the sectoral level, the Government has provided a policy
framework to support the development of household-based agriculture as promoted under the project.
Government conmnitment to the project was high throughout the project and as is reflected in the
establishment and maintenance of an efficient project management, including cooperation between different
line agencies. The organization and administrative arrangements made for the project with PLGs and
PMOs at each level from province to county, further supported by TCs at each level worked well and was a
major factor in successful project implementation. Adverse effects from a comprehensive Government
restructuring program were kept at a minimum as continuity of key project staff was generally maintained.
The one major shortcoming was the scarcity of counterpart funds from some Govemment sources which
had an adverse effect on implementation.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Project management was strong and the performance of the implementing agencies contributed
substantially to successful project outcomes. The PMO system, often in close cooperation with many
different line agencies, effectively supported participating households. There were some shortcomings with
respect to project documentation such as the quality of maps and the attention paid to loan and other
financial records. This resulted in some over-claiming of project funds in the early stages of project
implementation (subsequently resolved), and to slower progress in collection of repayments from
beneficiaries. Nevertheless, overall the implementing agencies have to be commended for their
performance; in particular, given the challenge of managing this project in many locations dispersed over
five provinces.
5.4 Costs and financing:
Actual project costs are US$336.0 million. This is about US$39.6 million or 13% more than the US$296.4
million estimated in the SAR.
IDA's share of project costs was US$139.7 million compared with US$150 million at SAR. The reduced
commitment of IDA funds resulted from a number of factors. A substantial amount of goods under ICB
(with an IDA disbursement share of 100%) were not procured. In addition, the effect of the devaluation of
the RMB from about 5.8Y/US$ at appraisal to 8.3Y/US$ at the beginning of project implementation in
1994 was greater than the price increases anticipated at appraisal. This resulted in a substantial increase of
IDA funds in RMB ternns. More watersheds could be developed with the same IDA funds in US$ terms and
consequently an equivalent of US$10.2 million was reallocated to a new IMSERC (see Chapter 10).
While the amount of counterpart funds was increased substantially, the additional funds mainly came from
the project beneficiaries whose share in total project costs increased from 16% at appraisal to 30%.
Farmers' own funds for project implementation comprise family and hired labor and some purchased input.
In particular, the cost of labor increased substantially leading to an increase in farmers' contribution.
Moreover, the accounting of counterpart funds such as farmer's contribution is difficult and in some cases
counterpart funds may have been overestimated.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Project sustainability is highly likely. The project supported the development of unused, and often barren,
red soils into a productive agricultural resource and pursued the strategy to improve farmers' income with
diversified crop and livestock production. The careful selection of participating households, the application
of comprehensive technical standards and adequate training, and the provision for operation and
- 9-



maintenance for irrigation and drainage facilities including farmers' involvement in water management are
important factors contributing to a high probability that the project achievements will be maintained and
even increased with further tree crops growth. The sustainability of the project would be reinforced by the
issuance of long-term land-use contracts to the beneficiaries and the continuation of the Government's
commitment to the project. Given the measures taken and technologies adopted, the project has also proven
to have sustainable environmental benefits, most importantly the improved soil fertility, reduced soil
erosion, improved water availability, and increased forest coverage. All these features are highly likely to
be sustained given the understanding of the farner beneficiaries and their economic incentives. The
sustainability of the agro-processing component is less certain with some enterprises not yet into production
and where progress in strengthening management through further privatization is not yet assured.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The Government is committed to take full advantage of the potential of the Project and arrangements for
future project management have been made with responsibilities assigned to the relevant line agencies or
commercial entities. Detailed plans for future operation include: (i) continued applied research in project
watershed and continued training to beneficiary households, including on pest management issues; (ii)
assistance to beneficiaries in marketing through provision of price and quality information and facilitation
of formation of marketing groups; (iii) support in the establishment of institutions for self-managed
infrastructure and other works; (vi) improvement of irrigation and other works where such works have not
been constructed up to the optimal standard; (v) improvement of project documentation, including maps
and financial records, and continued monitoring and evaluation of the project; and (vi) ensure cost
recovery. Management of agro-processing enterprises, presently under Government management, would be
strengthened through greater private sector involvement.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
Overall performance, including identification, assistance in preparation, and appraisal is rated satisfactory.
The Bank's input in terms of staffing and skill-mix was adequate. The Project identified was consistent with
the Government's and the Bank's strategies to develop environmentally sustainable agriculture, increase
employment and income, and help alleviate poverty. It built on the successes of the first Red Soils Area
Development Project, and took the concept further by planning an integrated, sustainable development of
entire (micro-)watersheds.
The Bank also provided valuable assistance to the borrower in its substantial preparation efforts. Between
identification and appraisal, 4 comprehensive missions with 5 to 9 members were sent to assist the
borrower in project preparation. The missions included the following specialists: agriculture, economic
analysis, rural credit, environment, agro-industry, project operations, water resources, and land-use
planning. Technically, the Project was very well prepared with detailed feasibility studies for 30 watersheds
and all agro-processing sub-projects and studies assessing environmental impact and project-relevant issues
such as, among others, frost risks and marketing. Close attention was also paid at an early stage to ensure
sound Project management.
The Bank's performance at appraisal was also satisfactory. The Bank's team was a nine-member mission
which reflected the comprehensive skill-mix used during preparation and included also a marketing and a
procurement specialist. The appraisal itself was comprehensive covering all necessary areas including
governnent commitment (including financial commitment) and capacity, project risks, the technical design,
safeguard issues (environment, resettlement, dam safety), and procurement and financial management. The
economic analysis for the Project was very sound. In retrospect, the one significant shortcoming in
- 10-



preparation and appraisal was the overestimation of the management capability of publicly owned and
operated agro-processing enterprises.
7.2 Supervision:
The Bank's supervision quality is rated satisfactory. Size and frequency of supervision missions must be
regarded as low for a project as large, complex and wide-spread as this one and more regular advice might
have lead to improved implementation. Only 9 full supervision missions with on average 3.5 members took
place over 7 years of project implementation. Given the resources, the composition of the missions was
appropriate, and staff continuity was well maintained despite the long implementation period. The task
team managed to identify and address implementation problems in an active and flexible manner, the advice
given to the implementing agency was constructive and highly valued, and follow-up action was effective in
solving the problems. Cooperation between the Bank and the borrower during implementation was close.
While the project would have benefited from a more detailed documentation of implementation,
performance ratings were generally realistic and adequate attention was paid to legal covenants and
safeguards.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory. Project objectives were relevant to the country's needs
and in line with Government and Bank development priorities and strategies; project preparation and
appraisal were sound; and project supervision, though less than desirable, identified major issues and
provided effective implementation support.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Project preparation by the borrower was satisfactory. The lessons and experiences from the first Red Soils
Area Development Project were adequately incorporated into the project design (see Section 3.5). All major
technical, institutional, economic and environmental aspects were addressed in a sound manner. While a
fully participatory approach to preparation should have had greater involvement of farmers, their needs
were taken into account, and the views of all stakeholders at central, provincial and local level were taken
into account. The Government committed substantial resources to the preparation efforts leading to a sound
preparation of the relatively complex, comprehensive watershed development approach. As part of
preparation, criteria for site selection were established, detailed designs were made for 30 watersheds and
all agro-processing sub-projects, and implementation arrangements were elaborated. Moreover, cooperation
between the Government and the Bank was close and the Bank's advice was well reflected in the final
project design.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Government implementation perfornance is rated satisfactory. As discussed in Section 5.2, the
Government provided the basis for the development of private agriculture as promoted under the Project
with its ongoing market-oriented reformns, both at the macro- and at the sectoral level, throughout the
Project implementation period. The commitment to agricultural development, poverty reduction, and
environmental objectives was high. This is reflected in the Government's overall policy, administrative, and
technical support. Moreover, PMOs at all levels were adequately maintained with trained and capable staff
of various specialties. Staff continuity was generally ensured despite the overall Governnent restructuring.
A shortcoming of the Government's implementation performance was that Government counterpart funding
was not always provided in a sufficient and timely manner.
7 6 implementing Agency:
The performance of the implementation agency is rated satisfactory. PMOs were overall adequately
staffed, both in terms of skills, training, and size and Project management was overall very effective.
- 11 -



Consequently, the quite time-consuming implementation process of this relatively complex and widespread
Project was accomplished almost within the time planned at appraisal, even though the project got
expanded substantially. Substantial technical knowledge was available and this capacity, in particular, still
increased over the course of the Project. Despite some shortcomings to carry out ICB procedures,
procurement was also satisfactory. However, an improved quality of documentation and record keeping and
a greater emphasize on financial management would have strengthened project management and better
facilitate the repayment of funds from the beneficiaries.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The overall borrower's performance is rated satisfactory. The Government and the implementing agency
have been committed to the project since its very beginning, and shortcomings in terms of counterpart funds
or some other aspects of project management are minor compared to the overall effective management of
the project.
8. Lessons Learned
The project has demonstrated the feasibility of a comprehensive development of small watersheds,
integrating crop and livestock, as a means to rehabilitate largely abandoned and infertile soils. The model
developed under the project can be further refined for wider application on large areas of similarly
under-utilized red soils in Southern China.
A project management structure that is embedded in the existing line agencies rather than a project-specific
management structure, as was done under the first Red Soils Area Development Project, is more likely to
assure long-term sustainability of project achievements.
Building up the fertility of degraded red soils takes several years and requires large quantities of animal
manure, green manure, and crop residues which are not readily available at the start of the development
process and need to be accumulated by increasing livestock production and annual cropping in the initial
years of implementation.
Important factors contributing to the success of the project are: (i) the development and application of
comprehensive technical standards; (ii) adequate training of both project staff and farmers, particularly
during the early years of the project; (iii) the selection of capable and highly motivated beneficiaries; and
(iv) the timely availability of counterpart funding, which is particularly crucial for the implementation of
common goods such as irrigation, drainage and roads.
During the first two years of the project the implementation of land development, crop establishment and
irrigation was too rapid and resulted in poorly executed works in some areas. This shows that the speed of
implementation should be in line with the capacity of project management staff and farners.
The need for diversification of production was already learnt from the first Red Soils Area Development
Project and was addressed in the design of this project. Considerable success has been achieved under the
project in diversifying orchard crops with deciduous fruits such as plum, pear and peach as well as various
citrus varieties and lychee, longan, and loquat. The serious frost damage which occurred in the winter of
1999/2000 underlines the need to minimize the risk of weather-related crop-damage. Farmers should be
encouraged to diversify orchard cropping and pay attention to the site selection of frost-susceptible crops.
The volatility of agricultural market prices during project implementation underlines the need for sufficient
diversification of crop and livestock production. At the same time, the marketing of production, in
particular of high-value fruit output, requires strengthening of market informnation systems and assistance
to growers in setting-up marketing groups.
- 12-



Investments into small and medium-sized agro-processing enterprises which are Govenmment-owned and
operated have generally been unsuccessful. By contrast, the project has shown that the involvement of the
private sector through joint-ventures or buy-outs has provided a much-needed injection in management
skills and working capital, which has resulted in efficient and profitable enterprises.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
Comments from CPMO
We believe the assessment of the project in the ICR generally reflects the actual situation of the project and
we appreciated very much for the efforts made by all of the ICR mission members. Here, we wanted to
emphasize some aspects of the project.
The design of this project, which takes watershed as a basic unit for development, is very successful and
will be valuable for other similar projects to follow.
We are satisfied with the assessment made on achievement of project objectives and outputs in ICR. The
project has really achieved a lot of benefits especially the social and ecological benefits such as poverty
alleviated, fanning practice changed, farmers' living conditions and environment improved.
We are also satisfied with the assessment made on economical and financial rates of return in ICR. The
figure was lower than that of SAR and we think the main reason for it was the substantial decline of the
project output price and the unusual disasters occurred in project area.
We agreed the analysis made on the Agro-processing plants in ICR. This component is not successful
because of decline of the output price, weak management, strong competition in the market and
time-consuming ICB procurement procedure.

10. Additional Information
A. Inner Mongolia Snowstorm Emergency Recovery Component
The amount of IDA financing used for the Second Red Soils Area Development Project was less than
appraisal. This reduction in costs stems from a more favorable exchange rate than estimated at project
appraisal, and from less ICB than estimated and beneficiaries purchasing certain inputs used under the
project themselves. The red soils development used some of these funds by increasing the project scope: 16
of the original 217 watersheds were expanded, and another 49 added.
In addition, the Borrower and IDA agreed in 2001 to use other cost savings for a new 'Inner Mongolia
Snowstorm Emergency Recovery Component' (IMSERC), an operation beyond the original project
objective and outside the red soils provinces. The component has the objectives to restore social and
economic infrastructure critical to the lives of nomadic herders devastated by an unusually severe
snowstorm in hard hit areas of Inner Mongolia and to enhance and strengthen the disaster response capacity
of the local government and affected herders." The credit amount of Jiangxi, Zhejiang and Fujian was
- 13 -



decreased by SDR3.095 million, SDR3.102 million and SDR3.528 million, respectively, while the credit
amount of Guangxi was increased SDRI.683 million. The net amount available from this reallocation,
SDR8.052 million, was reallocated to the new component. IMSERC became effective on September 24,
2001, shortly before the closing of the Credit Categories for the red soils development. It is sill under
implementation and not part of this ICR. IMSERC will be evaluated after its completion in a separate
document.

Outcome/impact indicators were not clearly defined in the SAR and were not reflected in the Bank's project
documentation. For the purpose of this ICR, the following impact indicators are reported to reflect the
achievements of the Project objective:
(1) Percentage of agricultural output value of project beneficiaries exceeding that of non-participating households
(in 2000).
(2) Income of project beneficiaries exceeding that of non-participating households (in 2000).
(3) Poverty share in project area (in 2000); baseline (1994) figures range from 14% in Zhejiang to 30% in
Guangxi.
(4) Percentage points of women employment share in project areas above share in non-project area (in 2000).
(5) Percentage of reduction in soil run-off coefficient in project areas compared to non-project (in 2001).
The figures are based on the household surveys carried out annually in each province (1-4) and agro-environmental
research in sample watersheds in Jiangxi, Hunan and Guangxi (5).

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits
Major economic benefits achieved by the project are the increase in agricultural production, farmers'
income and rural employment through the rise of productivity and marketability of agriculture, horticulture,
livestock, aquaculture and agro-industries in the project areas. These benefits have been quantified and
compared to project costs following basically the methodology used for SAR. Data sources are actual costs
from project records, actual production data and prices obtained from surveys and field visits, and up-dated
estimates for future prices, yields, etc. based on discussions in the fields and estimates of expert from
PMOs. Financial flows are converted to 2001 equivalent by applying the national CPI.
Incremental costs and benefits for watershed development as a whole are estimated by comparing "with"
and "without" project scenarios. For instance, for new cropland development, the entire costs of the
components and all benefits are incremental as there are no crops produced in the "without" project
situation and opportunity cost of the use of this land is assumed to be zero. New orchard investments covers
land terracing, soil improvement, irrigation facilities and crop establishment. Apart from investment costs,
incremental operation and maintenance costs including water charges for irrigation systems are all taken
into account.
In order to evaluate the watershed development, crop budgets and livestock activity models are developed
for each of five project provinces to reflect the regional differences. The financial analysis uses actual
market prices for inputs and outputs less transportation and handling costs to reflect farm-gate prices. For
the economic analysis tradable farm inputs and outputs are valued at border (parity) prices. In the case of
fruit, aquaculture products and live animals, which are technically tradable but actually sold in the domestic
markets due to quality and trade restrictions, financial prices are used as proxies for economic prices.
Similarly, no further adjustments are made for non-tradable farm inputs and outputs. In line with the
Bank's recent analyses of agricultural projects of similar nature in China, a Standard Conversion Factor
(SCF) of I is applied. This implies that no adjustments are needed for converting financial prices for
non-tradables into economic prices. The province level FRR and ERR calculations take into account all
incremental benefits and costs as they are arising according to the actual implementation progress achieved
in each province. FRRJERR for the whole project is derived as the weighted average of the provincial
FRRs/ERRs.
In line with the SAR's approach, the economic analysis of the agro-processing component is undertaken
separately. The analysis includes only enterprises which were operational at implementation completion.
Sub-projects that were either cancelled, or dropped after some initial investments or have stopped
production or are still not operational with limited information on their likely future available could not be
included in the analysis. The economic and financial return of these investments is assumed to be very low.
The calculations which are underaken are based on actual data provided by the management of the
enterprises. Future revenues are derived from sales prices and the operating capacity achieved in past years.
Tax expenditures are actual; in general, VAT is 17% with the amount paid to supplier's recoverable, and
corporate income tax is 33% of taxable income, i.e. with depreciation taken into consideration. In theory,
the IRR after tax and financing, which measures the return on the owner's equity (ROE), should be the real
financial IRR to the owner. However, all enterprises were set up as state owned. Consequently, the
distinction between debt and equity financing is blurred. Therefore, the return after tax is treated as FRR.
Detailed calculations of the economic and financial analyses including crop budgets and activity models, as
well as an assessment of each agro-processing sub-project, are provided in the project files.

Additional Annex 8. Borrower's ICR Summary
Implementation Completion Report
of China - Second Red Soils Area Development Project
I. Introduction
1.1 Project Background
The success of the First Red Soils Area Development Project funded by the World Bank in
red soils areas of Fujian and Jiangxi Province excited the World Bank's interest, and it was agreed
to loan a new credit to develop red soils in southern China on a larger scale. The project was
prepared by the Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Zhejiang and Guangxi provinces and MOA at the
beginning of 1990. The pre-appraisal was undertaken in March and finished in July by the World
Bank in 1993. The Negotiation was finalized in December 1993. The Credit Agreement and the
Project Agreement were signed between the People's Republic of China and the World Bank on
March 23, 1994 and the agreement was set effective on 23 June in the same year. The proposed
implemented duration was 6 years.
1.2 The Project Area
The project areas are located in the south-east of China, extend from 20014' to 33009' north
latitude and from 104°3 ' to 120043' east longitude. The landform is mainly hilly with elevations
from 65m to 1000m. The soil types are mostly red soils, while some are crimson soils. The annual
mean temperature varies from 160 to 200, the annual accumulated temperature is 55000 to 5800°,
annual sunshine period is 1360 to 2119 hours and frost-free period is 241 to 31 Idays. The annual
rainfall is 1100mm to 1900mm. Natural disasters include floods, droughts and frosts. The total
population in the project area is 43 million, with a rural population of 38 million. The number of
beneficiary households are 68 thousand and beneficiary farmers are 300 thousand.
1.3 Project Description
China Second Red Soils Area Development Project (Credit No.: 2563-CHA) is based on the
Development Credit Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the World Bank.
The project implementation lasted 7 years from June 21, 1994 to Sept. 30, 2001. The appraised
credit amount was 108.4 million SDR (about 150 million USD).
The credit funds was onlent by MOF to the five provincial governments at annual interest
rate of 5.38%, commitment fee of 0.5%. The annual onlending interest rate decreased to 2% after
the year 2001. The repayment period is 20 years, and the grace period is 6 years.
The CPMO established in Foreign Economic Cooperation Center of MOA and PPMO in
five provinces were responsible for the project implementation. Project Leading Groups, Project
Management Offices, and Project Science and Technologic Committees were set up at different
levels.
The project was designed to develop 217 watersheds with a total area of 52,500 ha and to
build 19 agro-processing factories. The main contents included: 1. Land development; 2. Crop
establishment; 3. Livestock and aquatic development; 4. Infrastructure; 5. Buildings; 6. Rural
energy; 7. Machinery and vehicles; 8. Agricultural Processing; 9. Research and Training.
- 29 -



During the mid-term amendment period in July 1997, the number of watersheds was
increased from 217 to 266, and 16 watersheds were expanded in scale. The project contents in
some watersheds were changed, area of citrus increased, scale of pig, sheep and chickens raising
expanded, mulberry area and chestnut area reduced. Procurement of some goods and some
agriculture processing plants were cancelled. The World Bank approved the proposal in June,
1999.
In 2000, according to the progress of the project and the financial budget, the credit amount
for Jiangxi, Zhejiang and Fujian was decreased by SDR 3.095 million, 3.102 million and 3.528
million, respectively. The credit amount of Guangxi was increased by SDR 1.683 million.
II. Objective, Design and Appraisal
2.1 Project Objective
The project objective is to improve the ecological environment, develop the large degraded
red soil areas in the south of China, promote agriculture production capacity and sustainable
utilization of soils through improving the quality of the water and soil, reducing the soil erosion
and changing farming practices, reduce poverty through increasing the income of the farmers who
are not fully employed in rural areas and obtain better economic, social and ecology benefit.
2.2 Project Design
The success of the Red Soil I project provided the experience and lessons for Red Soil II
project: improving the soil by increasing application of the fertilizer, especially organic fertilizer;
selecting capable farmers to take part in the project and establish the family farm; extending
advanced and suitable technologies; combining the agriculture with stock raising to supply more
organic fertilizer.
The innovations of the Red Soil II project were as follows: The project was designed with
watershed as unit for development; water and soil conservation strengthened; making full use of
water resource in the watersheds was emphasized and long-distance water conveying abandoned;
crop variety diversified; the demonstration effect stressed, extension and training of the new
technology in project and non-project areas strengthened; agro-processing investments were
focused on updating the existence equipment.
2.3 Appraisal of Project Design.
2.3.1 Six years of experience of project implementation proved that the design and the
technical pathway of the project are practical and have the following advantages: 1. Taking
watershed as the basic unit for development was very good for water and soils conservation and
sustainable agricultural development; 2. Planting vetiver grass and hedges to protect the lips of
terraces and increase ground cover to prevent soil erosion; 3. Application of more organic
fertilizer and low-residue, highly effective pesticides to reduce pollution; 4. Good varieties and
diversification of fruit crops to meet the requirements of market, increase economic benefits and
overcome market risk; 5. Emphasizing the water balance in watershed and enhancing the
irrigation facility construction to increase effectiveness of the irrigation system; 6. Strengthening
research and extension of the new technology; 7. Combining the development of crop, animal
raising and agro-processing to expand the production chain; 8. Developing forestry and bio-gas
to increase renewable energy resources.
- 30 -



2.3.2 There are some shortcomings in the design and planning due to the lack of
experience, the variation of watersheds and volatile markets, such as: 1. Estimated data were
based only on typical watersheds and these watersheds were different from some other
watersheds. This brought the unsuitability of some goods under international procurement; 2.
Underestimate of the market and weather risks. Project products such as silk could not be sold
well due to the sharp price decline in domestic markets, Longan and Lychee trees in some sites
were damaged by frozen disaster; 3. Speed of development at the early stage was faster and the
grade A of planting materials could not all be ensured; 4. Infrastructure investment was slightly
higher; 5. Agro-processing plants took longer time from designing to operating. The products
could not keep up with market change.
m. Achievement of Project Objective
3.1 Development of Watersheds
3.1.1. Land Development: The completed area of new and the rehabilitated terrace was
25590 and 3083 ha., accounting for 115.1% and 123.5% of the SAR target. The paddy

methods included international and domestic bidding such as ICB, LCB, LS and so on. The goods
procured included equipment, vehicles and materials. Equipment valued 23 million Yuan used for
irrigation, construction, agriculture, research and training, accounting for 45.6% of the SAR
target. The procured vehicles valued 76.376 million Yuan, accounting for 121.5% of the SAR
target. Materials included construction materials, agricultural inputs and livestock/aquaculture
- 31 -



inputs valued 1.48 billion Yuan, accounting for 134.5% of the SAR target.
Because of the changing market, high procurement commission fee, complex procurement
procedure taking a long time, the difficulties of the transport and delivery and the adjustment of
the project contents, some of the goods were not procured, including Power pesticide foggers,
fish pond aerators, feed processing machine, insulated vans, fish meal, amino acids, and some
office equipment.
3.3 Research
The 5 provinces have planned 56 research topics, 11 for Fujian, 8 for Jiangxi, 6 for Zhejiang,
6 for Hunan, 25 for Guangxi. The research topics covered the improvement of soils, fertilization,
water and soil conservation; cultivation technology for fruit trees; pest and insects control;
popularization of new varieties; models of red soil development; utilization of water resources;
project monitoring and evaluation; and so on. All these topics were carried out by agricultural
universities, agricultural technical institutes, forest technical institutes, and other research units in
each province. All these topics were finished. Utilization of these results were widely used in the
project area and helped the farmers on land developing, planting, management and establishing the
eco-agriculture models.
3.4 Training
The project conducted a lot of training, consulting and study tours during the project
implementation. These activities promoted the capability of project official and technicians on
project management and technology and were very helpful for project construction.
3.4.1 Domestic training: Farmers trained 895,831 person days. The subjects included
cultivation technology, pest and insects control, livestock raising, aquiculture, water and soil
conservation, land development, and marketing. Project officer and technicians trained 104,896
person days. The subjects included project design, project management, financial management,
monitoring and evaluation, agricultural engineering, technical service and marketing. The
domestic study tours completed 15,217 person days.
3.4.2 Overseas training and study tours: A total of 2,126 person days of overseas training
and study tours were completed, mainly in the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Israel,
and Japan on fruit cultivation and processing, environment protection, project monitoring and
evaluation and so on.
3.5 Investment and Costs
By June 2001, the project investment completed was 2.76 billion Yuan, accounting for
140% of the SAR target, including 97.33 million SDR (about RMB 1.1 billion Yuan) of IDA
Credit, accounting for 89.8% of the SAR target. The domestic counterpart funds was 1.66 billion
Yuan, accounting for 162.84% of the SAR target, of which 280 million Yuan was loan from
ABC, 560 million Yuan from the government and the rest 820 million Yuan was farmers'
contribution.
The project costs by components were: Land development 370 million Yuan, accounting for
172.6% of the SAR target; Infrastructure 305 million Yuan, 178.3% of the SAR; Buildings 260
million Yuan, 209.7% of the SAR; Vehicles and machine 88.69 million Yuan, 115.2% of the

development 410 million Yuan, 181.4% of the SAR; Rural energy 25.72 million Yuan, 177.6% of
- 32 -



the SAR; Agro-processing 370 million Yuan, 226.3% of the SAR; Research 15.3 million Yuan,
116.2% of the SAR; Training and study tours 63.76 million Yuan, 191.8% of the SAR. Project
management fee 60.52 million Yuan, 266% of the SAR. Frost rehabilitation took 20.84 million
Yuan.
3.6 Agro-processing plant
The project planned to construct 18 agro-processing plants and 1 wholesale market. Most of
the plants were cancelled because of changes of the market and economic conditions. At the end
of June, 2001, there were 8 plants and I wholesale market left. Of these, 2 plants were under
construction, 6 plants and the wholesale market had been completed and put into operation.
IV. Results of Project Implementation
4.1 Economic Benefit
4.1.1 Agricultural production capacity were increased
Output of agricultural, livestock and aquatic products from the 266 watersheds developed in
five provinces was greatly increased. At the end of 2000, production of the main products such as
citrus, peach and plum, chestnut, lichee, longan, and paddy was 30% to 50% higher than that in
non-project areas and had doubled compared to the yields measured before the project.
4.1.2 Financial analysis
Financial analysis from the provinces showed the good economic benefits of the
development of the watershed. The FRR was 18.26% in Fujian, 16.85% in Jiangxi, 17.94% in
Hunan, 18.62% in Zhejiang, and 19.21% in Guangxi. The FRR was lower than SAR estimation
because: I. The project cost increased as prices of project inputs increased. II. Prices and markets
changed. III. Output prices decreased and the market became small for the project output
products. This decreased the income to the project area. IV. The nature disaster caused much
economic loss in the project area especially the frost happened in December, 1999.
4.1.3 Agro-processing subproject
In general, most of the agro-processing subprojects did not meet the estimated target. Some
plants were cancelled, some were completed but stopped production, some are using only half of
their capacity. Economic benefit for these plants is not good except for Zhejiang Jinhua frozen
fruit and vegetable plant. Main reasons were the market changed and the competition increased in
the long period of implementation due to complex procedure of the procurement.
4.2 Social Benefit
4.2.1 Life of Farmers Improved
According to statistics by the five provinces, net income of farmers in the project area in
2000 had increased by 3 to 4 times over that in 1994 (before project), 15% to 30% higher than
non-project areas. Number of poor farm households below the poverty line decreased: before the
project the proportion was 15% to 30%, but in 2000 the number was under 5%, in some
watersheds, the poverty proportion was down to zero.
4.2.2 Employment Increased
The project provided many jobs in the project area and promoted the development of related
industries and increased the employment of labor forces, exploring a new way to transfer surplus
labor in rural area.
- 33 -



4.2.3 Women's Position and Role Strengthened
Large number of women attended technical training classes organized by the project to study
the skills of animal raising, farming and courtyard-economy management, playing a more and
more important role in family economic activities.
4.2.4 Transportation Improved
The construction of the pathway in orchards and new/upgraded village road brought many
conveniences to farmers in the project area.
4.3 Ecological Benefit
4.3.1 Increased vegetation cover, soil and water conservation.
The development models combing the cropping of forestation and vegetation changed the
traditional cultivation and formed an ecological agricultural system. Soil erosion was prevented
efficiently.
4.3.2 27700 sets of fuel wood saving stoves and 12000 biogas digesters were build under
the project. Agricultural waste were fully used to develop the biogas that alleviated the shortage
of rural energy and cleaned the rural environment.
4.3.3 Sustainable use of land promoted.
Combination of cropping and livestock raising promoted the sustainable use of land. Organic
matter content of the soil in orchards increased by 0.5-0.6% from that before the project.
4.3.4 Impact on environment is positive
The monitoring and evaluation on soil erosion, water quality, agro-chemical residue,
treatment of waste water and exhaust gas showed that the project implementation had little
negative impact on the environment, but positive. Environment benefits: improved soil fertility,
reduced soil erosion, improved water quality and increased forest coverage.
V. Analysis on Major Factors Affecting the Project
5.1 Factors difficulty controlled by Government
5.1.1 Market and price
"General Index Table of Agricultural Products Purchasing Price 1993-1999" showed that
agri-products price in 1994 was the highest while that in 1999 was the lowest. Major
agri-products of Red Soil II started to enter the market from 1997. Decline in major agricultural
output prices had a direct negative influence on farmers' income.
5.1.2 Natural Disasters
The disasters happened in project areas are drought, floods, cold temperature and typhoon.
Unusual rainstorm and flood disasters happened in some project areas in 1998, 70% of the
farmers affected by the floods and direct economic loss was more than 100 million Yuan. The
severely strong frost happened in December of 1999 affect more than 90% of the fruit trees in
some project areas, which had the most damage to orange, pomelo and other sub-tropical fruit
trees. This disaster not only increased project cost, but also delayed the time of harvesting and
reduced outcome of the projects.
5.1.3 The international bidding method of procurement
The international bidding procurement is the most economic and effective procurement
method in theory. But there were four shortcomings while utilizing the theory to implement the
project for procurement of the goods. Firstly, there are difficulties in the transportation of large
- 34 -



quantity agricultural materials needed in large areas in five provinces, and it is difficult to keep the
materials with short shelf-life. Secondly, the procedure is too complex and usually takes a long
time to be approved. Thirdly, the bidding cost is relatively high. Fourthly, some materials or
equipment could not be suitable to every place in a large area covering 5 provinces.
5.1.4 Exchange Rate Risks
The exchange rate was I SDR: 1.4873 USD and I USD: 8.60 Yuan in 1994, and changed
to 1 SDR: 1.3047 USD and I USD: 8.28 Yuan in 2000. The World Bank credit was withdrawn
from 1994 to 2000 when the exchange rate of USD and RMB was up, so the USD and the RMB
used by project was relatively less. If USD and RMB depreciated in the future years of
repayment, more USD and RMB will be paid.
5.2 Factors generally influenced by the Government
5.2.1 The Macro Economic Policy
The macro economic policy often affected the project, the poverty alleviation policy
increased investment in project area, the state sustainable agriculture development policy
emphasized the environment protection, the tax policy adjusted the farmers' activities, the
agricultural structure adjustment and the industrialization policy helped improve crop varieties and
increase the farmer's income.
5.2.2 Department Policy
During the implementation of the project, important supports were given by relevant
departments such as departments of finance, taxation, agriculture and water resources etc. One
shortcoming was the scarcity of counterpart funds from some Government sources which had an
adverse effect on implementation of project.
5.2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation
Monitoring and evaluation on project implementation were carried out in every watershed.
15 watersheds and 18 agro-processing plants were chosen for environmental monitoring and
evaluation. Monitoring and evaluation has played and will continue to play an important role not
only in the implementation but also in the operation of the project.
5.2.4 The participation of farmers
The farmers, the men and the women were encouraged to participate in the project
implementation. They were not only the participants but also the beneficiaries of the project. Their
hard working and expectation of a better life were the basic factors for the final success of the
project implementation.
VI. Sustainability
6.1 Major technical results achieved are sustainable. Major technical approaches of
development under the project such as contour terracing and planting, orchard irrigation systems,
intercropping, deep application of mixed chemical and organic fertilizers, different operation
models of production systems, self -management farmer groups and new farming practice are
widely accepted by farmers. The project has become demonstration of new technology.
6.2 Notable economic benefit achieved by the project could ensure the sustainable
development of the project. With the project, production and the productivity of agriculture have
been promoted and the economic income has increased notably which will ensure a sustainable
development of the project.
- 35 -



6.3 Improvement of water and soil conservation has provided a good ecology condition for
sustainable development of the project. The project implementation had a positive impact on
environment. The wasted or barren land was changed into cultivated land and. Soil lost was
controlled and fertility of the soil improved. Production in project area will increase continually.
6.4 Incentives given to the participants support the sustainable development of the project.
The stabilization of the long-term land use contract and the preferential policy for agricultural
development encouraged the farmers to work harder and get more benefit from the project.
6.5 High quality construction of watersheds established good examples for further
development. High standard of watershed development has achieved high yields and quality of
project products and brought higher income to the farmers under the project, which will
encourage more and more farmers to follow the example established by the project.
6.6 Continuous attention will be paid on the operation of the project. Long-term land use
contracts to the beneficiaries will be issued. Government's commitment to the project will be
continued. Operation plan of the project has been formulated.
VII. Performance of the World Bank and the Borrower
7.1 Performance of the World Bank
The performance of the staff from the World Bank has been excellent. It was good for
project unit staff using for reference.
7.1.1 The World Bank played a very important role in project identification and preparation
of the project. The staff from the World Bank showed excellent ability and high efficiency when
they worked in China. They brought many good ideas to improve the project design.
7.1.2 Great contribution were made by the World Bank supervision missions during
implementation of the project
Many valuable suggestions were brought out during the supervisions by the World Bank
missions such as establishment of 20 ha. demonstration site in each watershed., enhancing the
construction of the irrigation facility to meet the water requirement of the crops, diversification of
cropping to reduce the risks of market and climate disasters on certain crops, paying more
attention to the development of the livestock, water and soils conservation and agro-processing.
All these suggestions were very helpful for implementation of the project.
7.2 The Performance of the Borrower
7.2.1 During the preparation of the project, the government gave strong support to the
project preparation in the following fields: 1. site choosing; 2. financial support; 3. establishment
of PMOs; 4. project design; 5. pilot project construction and demonstration.
7.2.2 During the implementation of the project, commitments to the project implementation
by the governments at all levels were carried out. Great support from the government helped to
overcome difficulties occurred during project implementation.
Cooperation between the government and the World Bank was quite close and Bank's
suggestions were well adopted.

VIII. Experience and lessons learned from the project
8.1 Main experiences
8.1.1 The support from government was the precondition for successful project
implementation. The central government paid much attention to this project and issued
preferential policies for it. Local governments regarded this project as a sample of agricultural
development and economic development and gave support on establishment of the PMOs,
provision of counterpart fund, coordinating the relative department and making decision to solve
key problems of project implementation.
8.1.2 Establishment of an effective operation mechanism was the foundation of successful
implementation.
8.1.3 Establishment of a sound management system was the key point of project
implementation.
8.1.4 Establishment of a professional technical team was the guarantee of successful
implementation of the project. This team made their effort in every period of project
implementation. They went to the field to study and research, made project designs, provided
technical training, technical assistance and technical service to the farmers. They will continue to
work hard for project operation.
8.2 Main lessons
8.2.1 More attention should be paid to the construction of high quality works. Fast built
works in some project area did not match the technical standards and caused much repairing and
rebuilding.
8.2.2 Funds should be allocated to project implementation units in time. In general, the
credit funds were allocated to the project in time, but sometimes the credit funds were delayed in
some project area. This brought shortness of funds and impacted the project progress. The
counterpart funds were not enough in some project area and delayed the project implementation.
8.2.3 It was necessary to fully understand the standards and regulations made in SAR.
Because of misunderstanding to the SAR, the over claim of the World Bank credit occurred in
some project area and delayed the project implementation progress.
8.2.4 The long term enthusiasm of the project participants should be full cultivated. It is the
guarantee of sustainable project development. Some project orchards were given up by the
farmers in some areas. Some farmers were satisfied with the fact benefit gained from the project
and ignored the long-term development.
8.2.5 Agricultural industrialization should be enhanced. Small scale and separated operations
can not meet the market demand and compete with the foreign companies after entering the
WTO.
8.2.6 The complexity of the agricultural product processing component should be paid with
more attention. Most of these plants were designed in 1993. But the price and the market of the
agricultural products changed a lot after 1994. The price of pig, fruit and silk declined
continuously. Some agro-processing plants were cancelled. And some established plants has
stopped their production. To construct the agro-processing plant by utilizing the World Bank
credit often missed the development opportunity since the ICB procurement of the equipment
would take much time. So a new way must be explored about the agro-processing project
supported by the World Bank credit.
