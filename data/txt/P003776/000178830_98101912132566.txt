PERUSAHAAN UMUM LISTRIK NEGARA (PLN)
Appraisal of the Seventh Power Project
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
1 l.      This report covers the appraisal of a power generation project
for Perusahaan Umum Listrik Negara (PLN), the national power company of
Indonesia charged with the responsibility for power generation, transmission
and distribution throughout the country.  The proposed project includes the
third, oil-fired thermal power unit (200 MW) at the Semarang Harbor power
station in Central Java, associated transmission lines (121 km) and substations,
consulting services for engineering and procurement of major equipment for a
dual-fired (oil and coal) thermal power station in West Java (Suralaya), and
consulting services for a feasibility study and site investigations of a new
dual-fired thermal power plant site in East Java.
2.        The Semarang no. 3 unit will primarily serve the Central Java area
where additional generating capacity is most urgently needed. It will also
be most favorably located to meet the requirements of Java since Central Java
will be interconnected with the western and eastern areas by 1981. This
interconnection, at 150 kV, would be sufficient for satisfactory operation of
Semarang no. 3 unit.
3.        The engineering services for the dual-fired Suralaya and East Java
power stations are a consequence of the Government's decision to diversify
the pattern of utilization of the country's energy resources. Engineering
services must commence in 1978 to permit commissioning of the first two units
of the Suralaya plant in 1984 when they are required to meet expected
system demand.
4.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$161.5 million
equivalent, of which US$112.0 million represent the foreign exchange component.
A Bank loan of US$109 million equivalent is proposed covering the total
foreign exchange cost with the exception of those engineering services
(US$3.0 million) which were included in Loan 1365-IND.
5.        The project cost estimate for the Semarang unit no. 3, including
transmission, was prepared by PLN with consultants' help. It is based on
bid prices recently obtained for equipment for similar units (Muara Karang 4
and 5) as well as transmission equipment. Physical contingencies of 5% on
the total cost of the generation unit and tranmission equipment, and 10% on
the civil works for transmission lines and substations have been included.
Price contingencies of 35% overall have been provided to allow for future
price increases.
6.        Procurement under the proposed loan will be on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. Some
Participation by Indonesian manufacturers is envisaged, in which case a 15%
margin of preference on the c.i.f. price, or the prevailing duties, if lower,



will be applicable for purposes of bid evaluation. Over the past several
years, Indonesia has developed local construction industries capable of
performing civil works construction similar to that required for the proposed
project. One such contractor is performing satisfactorily on the Bank-financed
Muara Karang project. Consequently, the documents for the proposed loan
provide for the 7.5% preference in bid evaluation for domestic civil works
contractors for which Indonesia qualifies on the basis of its low GNP per
capita level.
7.        Independent reviews by two consulting firms confirm that the growth
opportunities of PLN's market are large, particularly in the industrial
sector where many captive generating plants exist. It is estimated that PLN
is presently serving only about 50% of the underlying demand. Consequently,
PLN's annual growth rates during the next several years are entirely a
function of its capability to provide increased power service. It is esti-
mated that PLN will be able to attain average annual growth rates of about
16% to 22% per year during FY78-83 as it increases its share of the total
market to about 80%. After 1983, the growth rates are expected to gradually
decline to about 15% per year.
8.        Power sector development in Indonesia, more specifically in the
island of Java which accounts for about 75% of PLN's market, has now reached
a stage where very large investments are required and coordinated system
planning is essential. Consequently, the assurances given by PLN under Loan
1365-IND with respect to system planning have been included in the documents
of the proposed loan. In addition the Government and PLN have agreed to take
the necessary steps to implement the development program as agreed with the
Bank during annual reviews.
9.        The 200 MW Semarang unit no. 3 represents the next step in the
least cost Java system expansion program. It is more economical than the
next best alternative of two 100 MW thermal units at the same location to be
commissioned in FY83 and FY84 for discount rates up to 20%. The i.nternal
economic rate of return is about 19%.
10.       "LN having achieved financial recovery, defined as operating
revenues covering operating expenses, the documents of the proposed loan now
include conventional financial targets consisting of gradually increasing
internal contributions to investments, minimum debt service coverages and
maximum debt/equity ratios.
11.       The average price level for power sales after the next proposed
tariff increase will be close to the long run marginal cost level of energy
supplied. However, the structure of tariffs needs revision. A new tariff
structure will be designed for implementation not later than April 1, 1979.
12.       The proposed project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$109 million equivalent for a term of 20 years, including 5 years of
grace. The loan would be made to the Government, which in turn would relend
the funds to PLN on terms equivalent to the Bank loan. However, following



- iii -
preferred public utility practice, the Government would finance interest and
commitment charges during the grace period of the loan.

PERUSAIAAN TIJUM LISTRIK NEGARA (PLN)
Appraisal of the Seventh Power Project
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Indonesia has requested Bank assistance for a
project consisting of the following elements:
(a) the third, oil-fired thermal power unit (200 MW) at
the Semarang Harbor power station;
(b)  associated 150 kV transmission lines (121 km) and
substations;
(c) consulting services for engineering and procurement of major
equipment for a dual (coal/oil) fired thermal power station in
West Java (Suralaya); and
(d) consulting services for a feasibility study and site investigations
for a new dual-fired thermal power plant site in East Java.
1.02      The proposed loan would be the seventh Bank Group operation in the
power sector with PLN the beneficiary in all cases. Credits 165 and 334 and
Loan 1259-IND were made to help finance a large distribution rehabilitation
and expansion program in the Jakarta and West Java areas. The third credit
(399-IND) and Loans 1127 and 1365-IND are financing part of the foreign
exchange cost of the five oil-fired generating units at the Muara Karang
steam power station (3 x 100 MW and 2 x 200 MW) on the outskirts of Jakarta.
1.03      In its power lending operations the Bank has been promoting a
balanced program between generation and distribution which is important for
the development of an organized power system. Furthermore, it has provided
funds for extensive engineering and management consulting services as well
as training of PLN's personnel. These efforts, on balance, have been
successful and the progress achieved is encouraging.
1.04      This report was prepared by Messrs. K. Stichenwirth, C.K. Chandran
and M. Munasinghe and is based on information obtained during missions to
Indonesia in March and August 1977.

2. THE POWER SECTOR
Background
2.01      The public power sector is synonymous with PLN, a Government-owned
enterprise statutorily responsible for all generation, transmission and
distribution of electricity in the country. Despite PLN's exclusive respon-
sibilities for electricity supply, companies and individuals have been
allowed to install generating stations for their own use when PLN was
not able to meet the demand. Partly due to inadequate and unreliable public
power supply in the past and because of the country's economic growth, much
of the power demand increase was satisfied by these small, private diesel
generating stations. They now account for about half of the country's total
capacity, representing uneconomic investments at high capital and operating
costs. PLN's major programs of distribution, rehabilitation and expansion
have, however, just begun to take effect. During 1977-82 economic new
generating capacity will also be added. PLN's large generating stations are
expected to gradually take over the developed market outside PLN's present
scope of supply and meet the bulk of future overall growth. PLN has thus
reached the take-off stage of development.
Existing Public Power Facilities
2.02      PLN's total installed generating capacity at the end of FY77 was
1,502 MW./1 It comprises 30% hydro, 17% steam, 22% diesel and 31% gas
turbine capacity. The island of Java accounts for about 75% of PLN's supply
with the bulk of captive generating plant also located there. Java has three
presently isolated power systems - West, Central and East; their present and
future installed capacity is given in the table below:

2.03      The attached map no. 12435R1 shows the existing 150 kV system and
the major extensions committed and under construction. The West and Central
Java systems will be interconnected by 1980 and East Java by 1981, to form an
all-Java Grid. The distances involved, however, will limit interregional

Authority from which PLN purchases the output.

power transfers to about 100 MW. More effective higher voltage interconnection
at either 400 kV or 500 kV is therefore planned for the mid-eighties.
Energy Resources
2.04      Indonesia has several alternative energy resources - hydroelectric,
oil, natural gas, coal and geothermal. The country depended largely on
hvdroelectric resources in the initial stage of development of its electricity
£ )ply; it is now predominantly oil based.
2.05      The hydroelectric potential is estimated at 31,000 MW, of which
only 2,500 MW is in Java, the main load center. Present utilization is 1.5%.
Wi 1 a few exceptions, unfavorable location of potential hydroelectric sites,
th. nondependable capacity value, particularly of projects associated with
ir-. gation, and long gestation periods limit hydroelectric development in the
near future.
2.06      A 30 MW pilot geothermal plant is to be set up in Java in collabor-
ation with New Zealand; if successful, it could lead to commercial developments
of an important nonfuel energy source in Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
2.07      The country has large reserves of oil and natural gas.  Intensive
explorations are being carried out to assess the total oil potential. Proven
crude oil reserves are about 15 billion barrels. Current production is about
1.7 million barrels per day.
2.08      Indonesia has large gas reserves.  Annual production is about
200 trlion cubic meters, used mainly for domestic production of fertilizer
and petrochemicals. Its use for export as liquified natural gas is being
increaFnd. This source will be available for electricity production only
where it is surplus to other users.
2.09      Indonesia's coal reserves are estimated at about 1.2 billion tons,
85% of which are in Sumat.a and 10% in Kalimantan.  Actual coal prc uction
has declined from about 2.0 million tons per year in 1940 to about 0.25 million
tons per year, but recent oil price increases have spurred efforts by the
Government to develop the cointry's coal resources.  The Bank is considering
n engineering loan designed to prepare an integrated coal mine and land/sea
cransportation project which would provide coal for the planned Suralaya
team plant in West Java. The proposed loan includes funds for financing
A ltailed igineering of the Suralaya plant (para 4.06).
I e Power Market
2.10      Several attempts have been made in recent years to prepare a
usable demand forecast for Indonesia. This has been difficult because of
lo consump ion levels and a background of public power supply which covered



- 4 -
only a fraction of the total market (para. 2.01). Furthermore, severe
restrictions on PLN's ability to supply including financial, management and
technical constraints made PLN's past record of sales an exceedingly unreliable
base for future projections. In 1973, a consultant, Chas. T. Main of the USA,
applied an indirect method of using growth probabilities in selected sensitive
economic sectors and their probable impact on other sectors. A more direct
detailed assessment of the underlying /1 demand in Java was made during 1974-76
by Preece, Cardew and Rider (PCR) of the UK as a part of the Bank financed
comprehensive Java System Development Study (Credit 399-IND). This study
quantified the effects of restrictions on supply during peak hours, low
voltage, self-generation and PLN's waiting lists. PCR's projections up to
1995 based on the underlying demand are given in Annex 2.
2.11      Realizing that PLN's sales would not immediately rise to the levels
of the underlying demand and that a certain portion of this market will
continue to be met indefinitely by captive installations, PCR also indicated
what it considered realistic targets of sales on which PLN could base its
future development program. This lower forecast is also shown in Annex 2.
It is substantially lower than the underlying high market forecast, but of
the same order of magnitude as an independent macro estimate which used
per capita GNP projections/2. These studies show that PLN's future sales, in
the short and medium term, will depend entirely on the rate at which PLN is
capable of satisfying an increasing proportion of the existing demand
whereas, in the long term, they are expected to reflect more closely the
growth of the power market based on the overall level of economic develop-
ment.
2.12      In 1976, PLN and the Bank accepted the PCR low forecast as a
reasonable basis for planning PLN's long-term development program (para. 2.14).
Based on this, a comprehensive, optimized program of generation and
transmission expansion was prepared by PCR. It was felt, however, that this
program should be jointly reviewed by PLN and the Bank and modified annually
to ensure that in the short and medium term, it is consistent with PLN's
actual development of generation, transmission and distribution facilities,
and with the growth of sales. The latest such forecast of PLN's sales, made
in August 1977, is indicated in Annex 1. It is about 20% lower than PCR's
low forecast in 1983 but catches up with it by about 1990. Accordingly,
growth rates between 1978-1983 are expected to increase from about 16% to
about 22% per year while PLN increases its share of the total market from
about 50% to about 80%; thereafter growth is expected to gradually decline to
about 15% per year.

Sector Development
2.13      The main sector objectives at this stage are:
(a) on the organizational side, to ensure that PLN expands its
sales in step with the growth of its generation, transmission and
distribution facilities; and
(b) on system planning, to ensure the lowest possible future cost of
supply.
PLN's system is currently characterized by extremely high costs, due both to
its widely spread out and fragmented systems, inefficient operations and the
ad hoc approach in the past to system expansion.
2.14      PLN's planning capabilities, particularly in system planning, have
been inadequately developed in the past leading to imbalances between gener-
ation, transmission and distribution facilities. Power sector development in
Java is now reaching the stage where very large investments are required and
coordinated system planning for the whole island is essential. Recognizing
the need for balanced development of generation, transmission and distribution,
the following agreements were reached in connection with Loan 1365-IND and,
with the addition of the requirement to take the necessary steps for implemen-
tation of the development program (subparagraph (b)), have been repeated in
the loan documents:
(a) PLN will adopt the lower forecast of the Java System Development
Study as a guideline for power development in Java until FY86/87;
(b)  PLN will review annually with the Bank the potential changes in
the load growth and the variations of its development program for
Java that are required as a result of such changes and it will take
the necessary steps to implement the program as annually reviewed
with the Bank; and
(c) PLN will review annually with the Bank its investment budget for
the next fiscal year before final Government approval. This
enables the Bank to express its views on the priorities assigned
to the investments included in the budgeL and on the resulting
balance among genieratioi, transmission and distribution inveitlnt-s
2.15      A generation development program for FY78-87 has been prepared by
PLN (Annex 1, page 2, and Annex 9) and submitted to the Government in August
1977. This program is based mainly on the most economic projects outlined in
the PCR study, rescheduled to take into account likely commissioning dates
and the latest demand forecast (para. 2.12). An understanding was obtained
from Government and PLN that this program will be used to plan PLN's
future investment during FY78-87 and, in particular, to initiate the prepar-
atory steps which are required for timely implementation of the projects in
the program. This program will be annually reviewed with the Bank.



-6-
2.16      As mentioned above (para. 2.11), the increase in PLN's market
share will depend on its capability to supply and, consequently, on the rate
at which it connects new customers. It is important, therefore, that PLN
adopt an aggressive marketing policy, an essential component of which is the
connection policy. PLN has therefore agreed during negotiations to submit
annually to the Bank for review its customer connection program for the
following fiscal year and, subsequently, shall implement the program in a
manner satisfactory to the Bank.
2.17      PLN's system losses, currently of the order of 25%, are high; the
figure has not changed significantly since the early seventies. Although
these losses are expected to fall to about 21% by FY85/86, more comprehensive
metering than presently used and efficient monitoring of all losses in genera-
tion, transmission and distribution on a detailed basis is essential to ensure
maximum possible improvement. PLN has prepared a detailed program of improve-
ment of metering and action to reduce these losses, together with more
comprehensive monitoring systems. This program was reviewed during negotia-
tions and performance targets agreed. Further reviews will be made from time
to time to agree on specific regional targets as well as targets for elec-
tricity generation, transmission and distribution.
2.18      The necessity for PLN to develop capabilities to evolve optimum
development programs was discussed with PLN during appraisal. PLN is in the
process of strengthening the existing system planning unit. Among other
responsibilities this unit will be in charge of updating annually PLN's
optimal generation and transmission programs on the basis of PLN's actual
performance in reaching its sales targets.

3. THE BENEFICIARY
Background
3.01      Although created in 1965, PLN's corporate existence is based on
the 1972 Electricity Act which was issued as Presidential Decree No. 18/1972
(Annex 3). In addition, a number of decrees interpret or amend the basic Act.
They are not only used to clarify issues not sufficiently treated in the existing
laws but also to regulate managerial and operational responsibilities.
3.02      The Electricity Act, drafted with the assistance of SOFRELEC,
PLN's management and distribution engineering consultant, originally aimed
at creating an autonomous public utility which would have been fully respon-
sible for all its activities. This was considered important because PLN
functioned as a Government agency reporting to the Directorate General of
Electric Power, a Department of the Ministry of Public Works and Electric
Power. PLN's responsibilities were ill-defined and, in fact, consisted only
of those for day to day operations. Important matters such as system
planning, construction, procurement and finance were the responsibility of
the Directorate General, relegating PLN's management to a secondary role.
3.03      However, during the discussions on the Act it became clear that
the Government preferred a partially rather than fully autonomous entity
since total autonomy would have been inconsistent with its policy of con-
trolling important sectors of the economy. Consequently, it was agreed
that the Government would retain responsibility for matters affecting the
national economy, for instance tariffs and approval of investment plans, and
it would exercise control over other matters it considers important such as
evaluation of bids and decisions on contract awards for investments financed
through the Government budget. PLN would be charged with the responsibility
for executing power development, drafting development plans for Government
approval and all aspects of operation. The Directorate General of Electric
Power was abolished.
Legal Status and Responsibilities
3.04      PLN is a public enterprise (Perum).  It is the executing agency
of the Ministry for power development throughout the country, carrying out
its objectives within the National Development Program in accordance with
Government policies.
3.05      PLN reports to the Ministry of Public Works and Electric Power.
The Minister determines its policy and exercises general control over its
activities. He is assisted by an Advisory Board consisting of the Minis-
ters of Finance, Industry, and National Development Planning (Chairman of
BAPPENAS) in making decisions on important matters.
3.06      PLN is responsible for construction and operation of power facil-
ities throughout the country, drafting of power development plans, draft-
ing of regulations on standardization, safety and licensing of captive
plant, and entering into contracts for purchase or sale of electricity.



- 8 -
It is also in charge of research activities in the field of electric power
and for organizing personnel training. Its draft regulations must be
approved and made public by the Government to gain legal force.
Organization and Management
3.07      PLN's organization comprises three operational levels:
(a) leadership level;
(b) supporting services; and
(c) execution level.
The leadership level, consisting of the management together with the deputy
directorships, is responsible for overall planning and guidance, data col-
lection, and central accounting and budgeting. It also maintains contact
with all Government agencies. In the field of construction it reviews the
bidding documents and proposes contract awards for major projects. The
suppotting services consist of the power research center and the training
center. The execution level includes the regional offices which are respon-
sible for all activities within their respective areas, including minor
construction, and the offices for major construction, called Special Projects.
Special projects are established as and when the need arises to carry out
projects too large or too important to be handled by the regional offices.
3.08      PLN's management (Board of Directors) consists of a President
Director and at least two other Directors. In addition to the President
Director, there are presently five, responsible for planning, operation,
construction, finance and administration (including personnel). The mem-
bers of the Board are appointed and dismissed by the President of Indonesia
upon the recommendation of the Minister. They normally serve a five-year
term, but may be reappointed. The President Director is responsible to the
Minister and the Directors report in their respective fields to the President
Director.
3.09      PLN's middle management (deputy directors, and chiefs of regional
offices and special projects) is appointed by the Minister upon the recom-
mendation of the Board of Directors. The deputy directors are responsible
to the directors in their respective fields whereas the regional chiefs
report to the entire Board of Directors.
3.10      The organization scheme is appropriate for delegating the
responsibility for day to day operation and construction implementation to
the regional managers. This is particularly important in the light of the
large area PLN has to cover and the long distances involved.



- 9 -
3.11      In certain areas, for instance accounting, annual reports and
maintenance of statistics, PLN's performance has improved significantly in
recent years. Project implementation has also improved. However, as pointed
out in paragraphs 2.14 and 2.17, PLN has not made sufficient progress in
other aspects of operational efficiency and system planning. In future, PLN
must therefore focus its attention particularly on these urgent needs.
Steady, but slow progress is expected because of the magnitude of the task
involved.
Performance Under Earlier Bank Operations
3.12      In the past the Bank has concentrated on providing funds for
a balanced power generation/distribution program in the Jakarta and West
Java area./l Three distribution projects (Credits 165 and 334, and Loan
1259-IND) for the rehabilitation and expansion of the distribution facilities
in the greater Jakarta area and three power generation projects (Credit
399, and Loans 1127 and 1365-IND) for the same area were undertaken to help
PLN in commencing the necessary modernization programs in and around the
capital city. The past loans and credits also provided funds for a number of
consulting services such as the large management consulting effort of SOFRELEC,
the Java System Development Study undertaken by Preece, Cardew and Rider
(PCR), feasibility studies of the 1,400 MW Saguling hydroelectric project,
the West Java dual fired (coal and oil) thermal power project (Suralaya), and
the study for a Java Extra High Voltage Interconnection.
3.13      PLN's performance in implementing the above projects was uneven
during the period 1969 through about 1975. The earlier distribution
projects (Credits 165 and 334-IND) are now expected to be completed about
two years behind schedule./2 PLN's overall inexperience in project imple-
mentation in the early stages of the projects was as much to blame for
the delay as was the lack of coordination between the Government, more
specifically the city planning department of the municipality of Jakarta, and
PLN which made it virtually impossible for the consultants to design a
distribution project for ultimate implementation. Similarly, construction of
the first three 100 MW units at the Muara Karang thermal station (Credit 399
and Loan 1127-IND) has fallen behind schedule by about two years. Cost
overruns in the wake of the oil crisis and consequent time-consuming problems
in raising the necessary additional funds, a prerequisite for PLN to be able
to let the affected supply contracts, were the main reasons for the delay.
3.14      Project implementation has improved since about 1975 and progress,
although still sometimes slow, is encouraging. It is unfortunate that the
delays mentioned in para. 3.13 together with other earlier deficiencies
(para. 3.11), the effect of which is now apparent, largely obscure the
progress PLN has actually achieved. Better progress in future is expected
when the benefits of earlier projects materialize.
/1 The Bank commitments in the Indonesian power sector so far, excluding
the proposed loan, amount to US$348 million equivalent.
/2 Credit 165-IND is fully disbursed. Since Credits 165 and 334 are con-
sidered to finance one project, a completion report will be issued
only after full disbursement of Credit 334-IND.

4. THE PROJECT
Description of the Project
4.01      The proposed project consists of:
(a) construction of a third oil-fired thermal power unit (200 MW)
at the Semarang Harbor power station;
(b) construction of 121 km of 150 kV transmission lines connecting the
Semarang Harbor power station to Ungaran, West Semarang and
Kudus;
(c) construction of two new 150 kV substations at Ungaran and
Kudus and extension of the existing Semarang Harbor, West
Semarang, Jatingaleh and Solo substations with a total transformer
capacity of 150 MVA;
(d) consultants' services for engineering and procurement of major
equipment for a new, dual (coal and oil) fired thermal power
station in West Java (Suralaya); and
(e) consultants' services for the preparation of a feasibility study
and site investigations for a new dual (coal/oil)-fired thermal
power plant site in East Java.
4.02      At the Semarang Harbor site in Central Java, two 50 MW oil-fired
units presently under construction, are being financed by the Agency for
International Development (AID) of the United States. Engineering is being
carried out by Black and Veatch International (BVI) of the USA. These units
will be commissioned early in 1978. The power station site has been laid out
for convenient extension. The proposed project will add a single, oil-fired,
thermal unit of 200 MW at this site during the latter half of 1982.    A
provision of US$3.0 million was made in Loan 1365-IND to cover engineering
and design, including preparation of bid documents and evaluation of bids for
the third unit to ensure its timely implementation, BVI was engaged for this
work.
4.03      Central Java is presently served by two separate, rapidly expanding,
150 kV power systems - the Tuntang in the east and the Ketenger in the west -
and some isolated diesel power stations. They will all be interconnected by
1978 on completion of the 150 kV Semarang-Pekalongan line to form the Central
Java grid. The Semarang thermal station, the major energy source in Central
Java, would essentially meet the electricity needs of Central Java, but its
timing and operation would be in the context of the all-Java grid (para. 2.03).
During the last few years, a major program of transmission and distribution
extensions has been undertaken in Central Java. Therefore, the only trans-
mission line extensions which are required to distribute the additional
power from Semarang Harbor station are those needed to link it to:



- II -
(a) new substations to be built up at Ungaran (which will have
adequate space for expansion and for future interconnection to
the Java EHV line - para. 2.03) and Kudus (a developing center
on the Semarang-Surabaya coastal route, along which a second
150 kV Central-East Java tie line is proposed); and
(b) the substation at West Semarang.
The aggregate capacity of step down transformers at the new substations at
Ungaran and Kudus and for extension of other substations at West Semarang,
Jatingaleh and Solo is 150 MVA. These essential transmission lines and
substations are included in the project.
4.04      Distribution extensions required in Central Java are minimal at
this stage and can be implemented under PLN's normal construction program.
4.05      The third power unit at Semarang Harbor will enable the growth of
demand in Java to be met until the end of 1983. A new major thermal station
must therefore be commissioned early in 1984 to meet further growth of
demand. The Java System Development Study (paras. 2.10-2.12) indicates a
number of economic projects of which the West Java thermal power station
(paras. 3.12 and 4.06) is the only one which can be implemented by early
1984. It also recommends that this station should use larger unit sizes (up
to 500 MW) than those currently under consideration (200 MW), and should be
designed to use both coal and oil.
4.06      Loan 1127-IND provided for feasibility stage engineering services
for the new West Java (Suralaya) thermal plant, in particular for selection
of the site, choice of unit sizes and conceptual design. Montreal Engineering
Company (MONENCO) of Canada was selected for this assignment. The field work
has been completed and conceptual designs are being prepared. MONENCO has
recommended a site at Suralaya on the West Coast of Java, across the Sunda Strait
from Sumatra, and the use of 375 MW sets initially. To meet a commissioning
target of early 1984, consultants would have to be selected to commence detailed
engineering by mid-1978. US$3.0 million have therefore been included in the
proposed loan to cover detailed engineering and procurement action up to the
stage of evaluation of bids for major equipment.
4.07      PLN's long-term planning for Java calls for developing new power
station sites on the island. In line with the Government's policy of using
indigenous coal to the extent possible for electricity generation, PLN has
requested the Bank to finance under the proposed loan the consultants'
services for physical investigations of a new site for a dual-fired thermal
power station in East Java. Consequently, an amount of US$1.5 million
(foreign exchange cost) is included in the cost estimate for this purpose.

4.09      The cost estimate for Semarang unit 3 was prepared by PLN with the
assistance of BVI. It is based on bid prices recently obtained for similar
units in Muara Karang 4 and 5 (West Java), experience of civil works construc-
tion at Muara Karang 1-3 and Semarang 1-2, and bid prices obtained recently
by PLN for transmission line and substation projects. The prices are net of
customs duties since all imports financed from aid funds are exempt from
payment of duties.  Physical contingencies have been provided at 5% of the total
cost of Semarang unit 3 and foreign cost of transmission/substations, and 10% of
the local cost (foundations and erection/supervision) of the latter. They are
reasonable. Annual price contingencies have been provided at 7.5% (1977-79) and
7% (later years) on foreign costs and, on average, 10% on local costs.



13 -
4.10      The specific cost of Semarang no. 3 unit is estimated at US$403 per
KW installed at early 1977 price levels and US$548 per KW, including escala-
tion up to mid-1983.
Amount and Term of the Loan
4.11      A Bank loan of US$109 million equivalent is proposed.  It would
cover the total foreign exchange cost of the project with the exception of
the engineering services for Semarang unit no. 3 covered under Loan 1365-IND
(US$3.0 million). The loan would be for a term of 20 years, including 5
years of grace.
Procurement
4.12      Procurement of materials and equipment under this loan would be
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank's guidelines. Some participation by Indonesian equipment manufacturers
for minor equipment items is envisaged, in which case a 15% margin of prefer-
ence on the c.i.f. price, or the prevailing duties, if lower, will be appli-
cable for purposes of bid evaluation. Documents of the proposed loan will
also include a 7.5% preference in bid evaluation for domestic civil work
contractors for which Indonesia qualifies on the basis of its low per capita
GNP.
Disbursement
4.13      The Bank loan will be disbursed against the following items:
(a)  major equipment - 100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported
goods, 95% /1 of the ex-factory cost for locally manufactured goods
and 65%/1 of the total expenditures for imported goods procured
locally;
(b) general construction:
(i) civil and structural works - 69% of total expenditures
(representing the estimated foreign cost)
(ii)  ancillary mechanical arid etri-L ecnis - 100% of  ror',
expenditureb, and
(c) consultants' services lO-OZ of foreign expenditures.
No disbursements will be made for expenditures prior to loan signing. The
closing date of the loan is December 31, 1983 or such later date as the Bank
will establish.
Engineering and Construction
4.14      As mentioned in paragraph 4.02, BVI will be responsible for
engineering design and construction supervision of Semarang 3. Loan 1365-IND
/1 The percentages represent prices net of taxes.



- 14 -
includes funds for consulting services up to the stage of bid evaluation
whereas the proposed loan will include funds mainly for construction super-
vision and training of PLN personnel in plant operation. The total consulting
effort is estimated to require 1,074 man-months at a foreign cost of
US$5.50 million (814 man-months in the home office at a man-month cost of
US$3,900 and 260 man-months in the field at a man-month cost of US$6,800 plus
direct expenses). The contract would be on a similar basis as that for Muara
Karang units 4 and 5. Bank approval of the contract will be required.
4.15      The estimate for design and engineering of the associated trans-
mission system has been made on the basis of 196 man-months at an estimated
foreign cost of US$1.47 million (109 man-months in the home office at a cost
of US$3,900 per man-month and 87 man-months at a man-month cost of US$6,200
plus direct expenses). PLN has asked Bank approval for appointing BVI which was
granted. The appointment is expected to be made in February 1978.
4.16      Detailed engineering and procurement action, up to evaluation
of bids for the major items of equipment for the West Java (Suralaya) thermal
station, is expected to take about a year and involve about 600 man-months at
a foreign cost of US$3.0 million. The estimate for the East Java Thermal
Power Site study is based on about 230 man-months at a foreign cost of
US$1.5 million. For both consulting services PLN will be required to invite
proposals from firms experienced in such work, and to appoint consultants
satisfactory to the Bank.
4.17      No problems of any significance are expected in the construction
of the project, as the Semarang thermal station site has been fully acquired
and partially developed for the proposed expansion.  The main fuel and water
supply system will be built in the initial phase, which will be completed
in 1978.
Ecology
4.19      Indonesia has not yet ruled on matters of environmental quality.
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards are being used as
design criteria. Maximum particulate concentration at ground level due to
exhaust gases will be below EPA standards and a mechanical precipitator will
be sufficient to remove solid particles from the gas. However, space will
be provided for future installation of electrostatic precipitators, should
they become necessary. Stack height will keep the sulfur pollution below EPA
standards even for high-sulfur Middle East oil which may be used instead
of Indonesian low sulfur oil. BVI will carry out surveys of atmospheric and
oceanographic conditions in the vicinity of the project area so that conditions
before and after the plant installation will be monitored.

5. JUSTIFICATION
Demand Forecast
5.01      On the basis of the latest forecast of PLN's sales (para. 2.12 and
Annex 1), its generation facilities will be unable to meet the forecast load
by 1982/83. The capacity reserve margin /1 will by then have been reduced
to the low level of about 12%.
Least Cost Solution
5.02      In the comprehensive Java System Development Study PCR has recom-
mended a least cost sequence of generation expansion which remains unchanged
when tested for sensitivity within the wide limits of the latest sales
forecast and PCR's high load forecast (which represents the total underlying
market - Annex 2). The next step in this expansion plan is a third thermal
unit of 200 MW at Semarang Harbor which can be added by 1982/83. The PCR
study shows that the above project is more economical than the next best
alternative of two 100 MW thermal units at Semarang Harbor when these are
scheduled in 1982/83 and 1983/84 respectively, for discount rates from zero
to 20%. This result is acceptable.
5.03      The programmed island-wide 150 kV interconnection, which will be com-
pleted by 1981/82, as well as the 121 km of transmission line extensions and
substations proposed under this project, will be adequate to distribute power
from the 200 MW unit. The distribution system, recently strengthened,
requires only minimum additions. The new generating capacity made available
under the Semarang 3 project in Central Java will thus be located advanta-
geously and where it is most urgently needed.
Internal Economic Rate of Return
5.04      The internal economic rate of return (IERR) is the discount rate
which equalizes the economic costs and benefits attributable to the project.
The project cost and benefit streams, and details of shadow pricing are
provided in Annex 8. Ideally, the benefits should be measured in terms of
the consumers' willingness to pay, but since this is practically impossible
to evaluate, the incremental revenues based on the average 1977 price of Rp
30.5 per kWh was used as a proxy for total benefits. The above is a minimum
measure of benefits principally because consumer surplus is ignored. On this
basis the IERR is about 19% which indicates that the incremental cost of
supply of project output is somewhat below the prevailing average tariff
level. The main reason for this is that there will be significant unutilized
capacity in Central Java's subtransmission and distribution network, which is
advantageous to the project. However, the long-run marginal cost of supply
(Annex 8) based on PLN's 1978-86 investment program is only slightly above
the existing average price.

6. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Past Performance
6.01      PLN's past financial performance has been closely linked with the
management consulting effort and the Financial Recovery Plan. The objective
of the Plan was to achieve full revenue/cost coverage in FY79, with interim
targets of 80% in FY75 and 90% in FY77.  Revenue/cost coverage was defined as
revenues from sales of power plus other operating revenues divided by operating
expenses consisting of expenses for fuel, operation, maintenance and adminis-
tration as well as depreciation, allowance for bad debts, and interest and
similar charges on debt, if any. Furthermore, it was agreed that all funds
provided by the Government /1 would be in the form of equity or borrowings on
terms not requiring debt service payments on the part of PLN during the
recovery period FY74-FY79. This was considered appropriate because burdening
PLN with debt service requirements at a time when it was hardly able to meet
its cash expenses would have had a retarding effect on its recovery process.
6.02      PLN has met the targets set for financial recovery as the following
table indicates (for details see Annex 10):

The recovery was achieved particularly through tariff increases totaling
214% between FY71 and FY77. It was attained three years ahead of schedule
(in FY76 instead of FY79). Consequently, the conventional financial targets

behalf. The interest provision in the revenue/cost coverage clause was
included as a precaution in case PLN should borrow minor amounts of
short-term funds from local banks.

discussed below have been substituted for the "Financial R1-very Pi ~" in
the proposed loan and all references to the Plan have been deleted from the
documents of earlier loans.
Financial Targets after Recovery
6.03      Bearing in mind that the revenue/cost targets of the recovery plan
were of a temporary nature, it was agreed in connection with Loans 1259 and
1365-IND that PLN would develop, in consultation with the Bank, a system of
conventional financial targets to apply after financial recovery had been
achieved. Such targets were designed over the past several months, were
discussed during appraisal and were agreed on during negotiations.
6.04      In designing the new financial targets special consideration was
given to PLN's circumstances, which are characterized by:
(a)  operations involving heavy costs due to small and fragmented sub-
systems, spread out over vast areas, outdated installations, gas
turbine operation for base load, and high system losses;
(b)  a large investment program to be added to a comparatively small
asset base; and
(c)  the desirability of beginning to finance a reasonable share of new
assets by debt and by internal cash generation.
6.05      The resulting agreements reached during negotiations are as follows:
(a)  a minimum contribution of 30% to capital expenditures through funds
from PLN's internal sources during any consecutive three-year period
starting with fiscal years 1982/83 through 1984/85 and continuing
thereafter; /1
(b)  to achieve above target PLN will make all efforts to reach the fol-
lowing interim targets which will serve as an appropriate indication
of the due diligence exercised by PLN in improving its operational
efficiency: /1
Contribution From Internal
Sources to PLN's Capital Expenditures
(consecutive three-year periods)
Fiscal years 1976/77-1978/79                        17%
Fiscal years 1Q79/80-1981/82                        21%
Fiscal years 1981/82-1983/84                        25%
Above targets will be periodically reviewed between the Bank and PLN;
/1 The performance test will be made on the basis of historic years. The funds
from internal sources (the numerator in the calculation) will comprise the respec-
tive three-year average of all of PLN's internal sources, including consumers'
capital contributions after allowing for debt service and variations in working
capital, the denominator will consist of the respective three-year average of
PLN's capital expenditures including interest during construction.

(c) a debt service limitation of 1.3 /1 to ensure that PLN refrains
from excessive medium-term borrowing; and
(d) a debt/equity ratio of not more than 60/40 to assure reasonable
borrowing levels.
Financing Plan

6.07      During the project construction period (FY78-FY83), net internal
cash generation is expected to finance about 20% of PLN's financial require-
ments. Internal cash generation is expected to increases to about 25% of
PLN's investments during FY78-FY86 which are estimated at about US$13.6 bil-
lion. PLN's gross fixed assets will increase to about ten times the 1977
level.  Despite the expected earnings improvement, the equivalent of $10.1
billion will have to be raised through bilateral and multilateral aid and
through the Government budget in the form of loans and equity input./l New
foreign aid equivalent to about US$7.8 billion will have to be sought./2  The
rate of return on average net fixed assets in operation will increase to
about 8% in FY83 remaining at about this level thereafter. The above data
illustrate the large efforts PLN has to undertake in order to transform
itself into a financially viable power utility capable of satisfying an
increasing share of Indonesia's power market.
Corporate Income Tax
6.08      PLN is beginning to earn profits which, in accordance with pre-
vailing tax legislation, would be liable to corporate income tax at the rate
of 45% of taxable profit. With the exception of a three-year carry over of
past losses, no system of investment incentives such as tax credits, acceler-
ated depreciation or reinvestment in PLN of levied taxes, now apply for PLN.
However, such investment incentive benefits are common in other countries and
are being applied to some revenue earning corporations in Indonesia. PLN is
also expected to enjoy the same treatment. Consequently, the attached
projections do not assume an income tax liability on the part of PLN.
Subsidiary Loan
6.09      As in previous operations, the Government has agreed to relend the
proceeds of the proposed loan to PLN on terms equivalent to those of the Bank
loan. In addition, interest and commitment charges during the grace period of
the loan will be capitalized, a procedure which is in line with financing
practices in public utilities. Signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement is
a condition of loan effectiveness.
Audit
6.10      As agreed under earlier operations, the Directorate General of
State Financial Supervision, which by law has to audit PLN, will audit PLN's
accounts as long as it continues to provide satisfactory audit. However, an
understanding was reached during negotiations that, in addition to the
Government auditor, PLN will employ on a one-time basis a commercial auditor
acceptable to the Bank so that PLN can benefit from the views of a new
auditor. Audit reports will be sent to the Bank annually not later than six
months after the close of the fiscal year.
/1 Because of the absence of a working local capital market in Indonesia,
both Government contributions and borrowings have to be made available
through the Government budget.
/2 The total foreign cost of all PLN capital expenditures, consisting of
projects either already under construction or construction of which is
planned to start during FY78-86, is estimated at US$10.2 billion. Of
this amount, about US$2.4 billion are committed.

Insurance
6.11      PLN does not presently insure its property in operation although
insurance against hazards of acquisition and transportation and delivery of
goods is regularly arranged. A review by SOFRELEC revealed that insurance
rates are exorbitantly high in Indonesia and would be prohibitive for PLN.
As an interim measure, an understanding was reached in earlier operations that,
pending development of a self-insurance plan by PLN, the Government will pro-
vide PLN with the funds required to cover normally insurable damage minus a
deductible amount equivalent to $100,000. This arrangement will continue under
this project.
Tariffs
6.12      PLN's basic tariff is based on the 1972 tariff study by SOFRELEC
and introduced by Government decree on June 12, 1973. Subsequently, sur-
charges have been levied which have raised the level of average revenues to
about 100% of the basic tariff. The surcharges were only on the energy
charge, leaving the demand charge unchanged. This has led to distortions in
the tariff structure and requires correction.
6.13      The average price per kWh after the next tariff increase in FY78/79
(Annex 10) will approximate the long run marginal cost (LRMC) of energy supplied,
based on a nine-year investment program (Annex 9). However, although the
average price level is acceptable, the structure of tariffs needs revision. As
a first step, agreement was reached in previous operations that PLN will design
a new tariff structure to become effective not later than April 1, 1979.
The Bank will assist PLN in designing such a tariff structure. In the present
operation agreement was reached that the new tariff structure will reflect as
closely as possible the long run marginal cost to the economy of meeting the
demand for electricity.
6.14      At present PLN collects high connection charges which deter customers
from seeking connections. This policy is in any case not appropriate with PLN's
increasing supply capability and its objective of increasing its share of
electricity supply. Together with the new tariff structure (para. 6.13), the
Bank will assist PLN in reviewing its customer connection policy (para.
2.16), treating it as an integral part of the overall financial policy.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the followitig
principal points and appropriate covenants were included in the documents:
(a)  adoption of the lower of two projections of the Java System Develop-
ment Study as a guideline for system development in Java until FY87
(para. 2.14 (a));
(b)  annual review with the Bank of potential load growth changes and
variations in the Java system development program (para. 2.14 (b));
(c)  annual review with the Bank of PLN's annual investment budget
(para. 2.14 (c));
(d)  annual review of PLN's customer connection program (para. 2.16);
(e)  implementation of plans to attain specific targets on reduction of
system losses (para. 2.17);
(f)  achievement of (para. 6.05):
(i) specific internal contribution to investment targets;
(ii) a debt service limitation of 1.3; and
(iii) a maximum debt/equity ratio of 60/40; and
(g) design and implementation of a new tariff structure to be
implemented not later than April 1, 1979 (para. 6.13).
7.02      Signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and
PLN is a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 6.09)
7.03      The proposed Project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$109 million, for a term of 20 years including five years of grace.

and Business Rules of PLN. This regulation revokes
Decree No. 1/PRT/1973; and
(d) various decrees on budget administration.
Status
2.        PLN is a Public Enterprise (Perum).  It is the executing agency
of the Ministry of Public Works and Electric Power for power development
throughout the country, carrying out its objectives within the National
Development Program in accordance with Government policies. All legal
provisions existing in Indonesia and not revoked or modified by above decrees
continue to apply.
Responsibilities
3.        Most of the activities mentioned below are PLN's exclusive res-
ponsibility. In some cases, however, the Government retained the right of
final decision, and if so, appropriate notes have been made. PLN's respon-
sibilities are:
(a) construction and operation of generation, transmission
and distribution facilities including procurement. Despite
Decree No. 12/PRT/1975, which provides the Government with
the authority for procurement of goods and services financed
from the national budget, an undertaking was received from
the Government during negotiations that it will restrict
its involvement to bid evaluation only.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
(b) drafting of power development plans based on demand surveys and
load forecasts. These programs become part of the national
development plan and, consequently, are subject to Government
approval;
(c) drafting of regulations licensing power installations owned by
third parties. After approval by the Minister, administration of
the regulation becomes PLN's responsibility. At the moment the
following licensing rules apply:
(i) no registration is required for power generators
of less than 2 kVA capacity;
(ii) generators with a capacity of 2-25 kVA must be
registered with PLN;
(iii) prior to installing a generator of more than
25 kVA capacity, a permit must be obtained from
PLN; and
(iv) installations existing before May 18, 1972 (date
of PLN's Charter) are exempt from above licensing
provisions.
(d) entering into purchase or sales contracts of electric power with
third parties;
(e) organizing of training for its personnel; and
(f) conducting research in the field of electric power.
In exercising its responsibilities, PLN is entitled within the framework
of existing laws and regulations to:
(a) make use of private and public roads;
(b) enter into and/or make temporary use of public and
private property;
(c) install wires and cables above or under public and
private property; and
(d) dig in public as well as private roads.
Supervision by Government
4.        The Minister determines PLN's policy and exercises general control
over its activities. He is advised by an Advisory Board consisting of the
Ministers of Finance, Industry and National Development Planning (Chairman
of BAPPENAS) on all policy matters, including annual and long-range development
programs, tariffs, audits and other issues of major importance for PLN's
activities.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
Management
5.        PLN's management is in the hands of a Board of Directors consisting
of a President Director and at least two Directors. At the moment there are
five Directors responsible for planning, construction, operation, finance
and administration. The President Director is responsible to the Minister,
and the Directors report to the President Director in their respective fields.
6.        In performing its management functions the Board acts as an agent
of the Minister. The members of the Board are appointed by the President
of the Republic for a maximum period of five years. They are eligible for
reappointment.
7.        PLN's middle management consists of (see also Organization Chart
on page 6):
(a) Deputy Directors in headquarters;
(b)  Director Power Research Center;
(c)  Director Training Center;
(d) Chiefs, Regional Offices; and
(e) Chiefs, Special Projects.
They are appointed by the Minister upon recommendation of the Board. The
officials mentioned in (a) through (d) are responsible to the Board.
Concerning the Chiefs, Special Projects the decree is not clear. For all
practical purposes, however, they can also be considered as responsible to
the Board.
Organization
8.        The organization is divided into three distinct levels which
reflect the fact that PLN has to cover a huge area with largely inadequate
communication and transportation facilities:
(a) Leadership - Board of Directors together with the deputy director-
ships, all located in headquarters. Internally the leadership
level is responsible for overall guidance, planning and policy
matters in coordination with the Ministry. Externally it keeps
contact with all agencies of the GoVernment, particularly the
Ministries of Public Works and Electric Power. Operationally
headquarters performs all the tasks prior to implementation (for
instance drafting and review of bidding documents, budget, and
operation of the central warehouse and workshop) and collection
and finalization of statistical and accounting data.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
(b) Supporting
Services       - Power Research Center and Training Center.
(c) Executing
Level          - Regional Offices and Special Projects.  The
regional offices are responsible for all opera-
tional matters within their area as well as the
implementation of minor projects. Special
Projects are construction implementation units
for projects too large or too important to be
handled by regional offices.
9.        PLN's directorates in headquarters have the following responsi-
bilities:
(a) Directorate
Planning       - Technical as well as management planning; input
for the national development plans; designing of
technical standards throughout the country; evalua-
tion of application for captive plant licenses;
and bid evaluation and bid award.
(b) Directorate
Operation      - Guidance and supervision in matters of operation
and maintenance of generation transmission and
distribution facilities; construction of minor
distribution facilities; operation of the central
workshop and warehouse; and drafting of power
supply contracts with third parties.
(c) Directorate
Construction   - Guidance and supervision in project implementation;
research on improvement of construction methods;
procurement of construction equipment, if required;
construction contract supervision; and drafting
and supervision of construction budget.
(d) Directorate
Finance        - Central accounting and financial management;
drafting and supervision of the revenues and
expenditures budget; and internal audit.
(e) Directorate
Administration - Performance of administrative services; personnel
management; legal assistance; Board secretariat;
and personnel safety.
Audit
10.       PLN's external audit is the responsibility of the Directorate
General of State Financial Supervision. PLN has to submit its annual accounts



ANNEX 3
Page 5
for auditing not later than six months after the end of the fiscal year.
The audit should normally be completed within three months. The Directorate
maintains staff in PLN's headquarters who are responsible for a permanent
audit.
Budget
11.       The budget of revenues and expenditures is within PLN's authority
and has to be submitted to the Government only for information and as
supporting data on internal cash generation. The investment budget, however,
is subject to strict Government regulations and, although PLN enjoys slightly
more autonomy than other state enterprises, the budget process is still
cumbersome. The following paragraphs illustrate the preparation, approval
and supervision process of PLN's investment budget.
12.                            Budget Calendar
(Fiscal Year April 1 - March 31)
September
through    -  After negotiations with BAPPENAS on work programs to be
December       performed in the coming fiscal year as well as budget
ceiling settings (this is in fact a continuous process),
the final budget proposal (Daftar Usulan Projek - DUP) is
submitted through the Minister of Public Works and
Electric Power to BAPPENAS and the Ministry of Finance
to be included in the Rencana Anggaran Pendabatan dan
Belanja Negara (RAPBN), the overall budget proposal.
January    -  The President of the Republic submits the overali
budget proposal to the Parliament for approval.
March      -  Before the end of March the Parliament has to finish
its deliberations on the budget proposal which, after
approval, becomes the final budget (Anggaran Pendapatan
dan Belanja Negara - APBN).
April      -  The Ministry of Finance through the Minister of Public
Works and Power informs PLN of its share of the final
Government budget. This is called Daftar Isian Projek
(DIP).
13.       For each fiscal year regulations on budget withdrawal procedures
are stipulated by decree. They may differ somewhat from year to year, but in
principle remain unchanged. In the case of PLN the various regional Treasury
offices receive authorization to release quarterly the budgeted amounts over
which PLN then has spending authority.

Coal - US$25 per ton (assumed supply cost in Suralaya).
From the above table, the long-run marginal cost (domestic prices)
equals Rp 31.3 per kWh for a 10% discount rate and Rp 34.2 for a 12%
discount rate using a standard conversion factor of 0.87 to convert
from border prices to domestic prices. The actual average tariff for
1977 is Rp 30.5 per kWh, the expected average tariff for 1978 is
Rp 34.9 per kWh.

SEVENTH POWER PROJECT
Notes and Assumptions on Financial Data
Sales of Power
The forecasts of electricity sales are based on the mission's best
estimates of the market share PLN will be able to satisfy. As shown in Annex
1, this results in annual sales increases of 12% to 22% between FY1977 and
1983, gradually decreasing to lower growth rates thereafter. The high growth
rates in the earlier years are expected to occur because PLN has already made
large investments in distribution facilities (particularly in Java) which
after commissioning of generation capacity, presently under construction,
will permit it to pick up demand with only minor additional investment.
Revenues from Sales of Power
Starting from the 1977/78 budget level of average Rp 29 per kWh,
tariff projections and increases believed to be feasible have been included
in the forecasts.
Purchased Power
The bulk of the power purchases is from the Juanda hydroelectric
station (Jatiluhur Authority) and amounts at present to Rp 1.47 per kWh
(USj0.35 per kWh). This expense increases in step with PLN's tariff
adjustments.
Fuel
Present fuel prices (effective April 1, 1976) are (at PERTAMINA
terminal):
Bunker "C" Oil               :   Rp 22 per litre /1
High Speed Diesel (HSD)           Rp 25 per litre
Industrial Diesel (IDO)    :   Rp 22 per litre
In addition there are surcharges for the cost of transportation which vary
according to the location of the power stations. On average the charges are
Rp 0.55 per litre for Bunker C, Rp 1.237 per litre for HDS and Rp 4.4 per
litre for IDO.
/1 This is equivalent to US$8.43 per barrel and compares to about US$11.60
per barrel in the world market. Indonesia's oil price is based on
PERTAMINA's cost plus about 20% profit margin.



ANNEX 10
Page 5
The cost of coal for the planned Suralaya power station is not known
yet. For the financial projections the comparative prices with the world
market price of crude oil resulting from the study undertaken by the Montreal
Engineering Company (MONENCO) have been assumed. They are:
US$24.98 per metric ton plus 10% (mission assumption)
to allow for 1977 price escalation (at a discount rate
of 10%).
Assuming a specific consumption of 0.5 kg per kWh generated, the resulting
production cost is Rp 5.70 (USt 1.37) per kWh.
To take into account future inflation, 10% price escalation per year
has been assumed.
Personnel Expenses
The projections of personnel costs are based on PLN's staffing plans
which assume increases from presently about 21,000 to 27,000 in FY 1986 (opera-
tion personnel from 16,200 to 19,900).
Material
The cost for materials and supplies has been increased in step with
the commissioning of the projected plant.
Depreciation
The depreciation rates are those used by PLN in the past and applied
in other countries for similar type of plant. On an average these are 5% per
year for thermal plant, 2.5%, for hydroplant and 3.5% for transmission and dis-
tribution equipment.
Consumers' Contributions
Consumers' capital contributions have been assmad to reach their
peak in FY1984 gradually receding to lower levels later.
Borrowing and Debt Service
It must be assumed that the Government, the only source of capital
in Indonesia, will only gradually shift to lending at a large scale. In
particular, it is likely that the ongoing projects will continue to be financed
through equity. The assumed average terms of the loans are 19 years,
including four years of grace, and 9% interest per year (capitalized and
financed during the grace period).
