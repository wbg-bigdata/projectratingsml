INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A
SEVENTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of $109 million to help
finance a Seventh Power Project. The loan would have a term of 20 years,
including five years of grace, with interest at 7.45% per annum. Proceeds of
the loan would be onlent to Perusahaan Umum Listrik Negara (PLN), the electric
power authority on the same terms as those of the proposed loan. Interest
during the grace period would be capitalized.
PART I - THE ECONOIMY
2.        The last economic report on Indonesia, "Indonesia:  Recent Develop-
ments and Medium-Term Perspective," of March 8, 1977 (1516-IND) described the
recovery of the economy from the world recession and the financial troubles
of Pertamina, the state oil company, and examined some of the important
development issues which the country faces in the next few years.
3.        During Indonesia's First Development Plan period (1969/70-1973/74) L1,
the rehabilitation of the Indonesian economy was almost completed. Transport,
power, irrigation works and other infrastructure facilities, after years of
neglect, were greatly improved and strengthened. Agricultural output expanded
at an average rate of 4.5% a year and the foundations of modern industry -
fertilizer, cement, etc. - were laid. During this period, the annual rate of
economic growth exceeded 7.5%; domestic savings and investments also rose
rapidly. With the start of the Second Development Plan period (1974/75-1978/79),
the Government expected that rehabilitation would be completed and a start
made on a course of long-term development which would assure not only a
satisfactory rate of economic growth but also a wider distribution of income.
The first two years of the Plan were dominated by the developments in the oil
sector - the sharp increase in the price of oil and Pertamina's serious
financial difficulties. The latter arose from Pertamina's undertaking of a
large and diversified investment program wiLhout arranging satisfactory
financing. With the onset of the world recession, bank credit became more
restrictive. Pertamina was unable to roll over its short-term debt and
failed to meet the financial obligations which were falling due. In these
circumstances, the Government stepped in and undertook to assume the oil
company's obligations.   The repayment of these Qbligations, along with the
fall in export earnings as a result of the recession, necessitated large
/1 Indonesian fiscal year April 1 to March 31.



foreign commercial borrowing, seriously strained the Government's budgetary
resources and Indonesia's balance of payments, and led to a sharp decline in
the foreign exchange reserves.
4.        During 1976/77 Indonesia's exports recovered strongly following
improvements in the world economy, and rose to a level higher than expected
earlier. Imports continued to increase rapidly, but the rate of increase
of import prices slowed down, and Indonesia's terms of trade improved. Most
of Pertamina's short-term debt had been repaid by the end of 1975/76, and
disbursements on foreign borrowing continued to be high in 1976/77. As a
result, Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves rose to a more comfortable
level i.e. $1.5 billion at the end of 1976 or the equivalent of three months
of imports. In the course of 1977, the foreign exchange position improved
still further with reserves amounting to $2.4 billion in September.
5.        The Government's budgetary position was also much better in 1976/77.
With the boost in oil exports and a further renegotiation of oil contracts,
oil revenues rose by close to 40%. Non-oil revenues also rose over and above
the amounts budgeted, mainly as a result of Government efforts to curb
smuggling and a more rigorous collection of customs duties. The additional
revenues together with continued restraint in increasing current expenditures
enabled the Government not only to increase development expenditures substantially
but also to repay the debt to Bank Indonesia, which it had incurred in the
previous year.  This helped to neutralize the monetary expansion on aqcount
of the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. In the course of 1976/77,
inflationary pressures eased resulting in a lower inflation rate averaging
15% for the year compared with 20% in 1975/76. A further slight reduction in
inflation is anticipated for 1977/78.
6.        In 1976/77, the domestic economy recovered in other respects also.
The available indicators suggest that industrial output and private investment
rose faster than in the previous two years. The output and prices of tree
crops rose with foreign demand, thus raising the incomes of the producers.
This provided a welcome relief to the small producers, who had previously
suffered from the declining foreign prices of their produce combined with
rising domestic prices of consumer goods. However, the production of food
crops slackened and rice output failed to rise appreciably for the third year
in succession. The domestic price of rice has been kept stable only by means
of very substantial imports. In 1976/77 these amounted to 1.6 million tons
(about 10% of domestic consumption) and in 1977/78 imports are expected to
reach 2.5 million tons - or approximately 15% of domestic consumption and 30%
of the international trade in rice. In both years drought affected the
harvests, but, more importantly, a pest infestation afflicted large areas in
Java, particularly those planted with the high yielding varieties of rice.
Rice output also failed to increase because the use of fertilizer did not
rise, despite ample availability. The Government has now relaxed controls on
the distribution of fertilizer and set its fertilizer/rice price ratio at a
level that should encourage fertilizer use.
7.        The large increase in the oil revenues over the past three years
has been invested, not consumed. Government development expenditures more
than quadrupled over this period and in 1976/77 amounted to Rp 2 trillion



- 3 -
(or about $5 billion); even after allowing for the high rate of inflation,
development expenditures rose in real terms by 35% a year. Rough estimate
indicate that more than 20% of GNP was invested in Indonesia in 1976/77.
Recent indications suggest that in 1977/78, there will be a decline in real
terms in Government savings, and hence in domestic funds available for
development expenditures as a result of a deceleration of the growth of oil
production and continued rapid growth of current expendiures. A further and
sharper decline in Government savings in real terms is expected in 1978/79
and the declining trend will continue during the next few years unless
rigorous new measures are taken to increase non-oil revenues and to improve
tax collection further.
8.        The effect of the high level of investment expenditures in recent
years, however, cannot yet be seen in the growth of the lndonesian economy.
In fact, the economic growth in the first three years of Indonesia's Second
Development Plan (1974/75-1976/77) has been somewhat slower than the
observed long-term trend rate of 7.5% a year. The world recession, uncertain-
ties following the Pertamina crisis and domestic inflation (which made some
domestic industries uncompetitive with imports), all had a dampening effect
on the growth of the economy. Indonesia's growth rate also failed to accelerate
because the economic benefits from investments in recent years have been slow
in coming and because the growth in the private sector slackened. New
investment has been concentrated on relatively capital-intensive industrial
and infrastructure projects with long gestation periods; some projects, such
as Krakatau steel, have been further delayed by slow implementation. Moreover,
the realization of economic benefits from investments in such sectors as
transportation, telecommunications, etc. depends on the growth in demand which
in turn is determined by the growth of the rest of the economy, mainly the
private sector. Unfortunately, the private sector seems to have failed to
provide the necessary momentum of growth. The indications are that investments
in this sector, because of the Government's attempts to control domestic
inflation or because of the world recession, rose only modestly in the first
three years of the Plan.
9.        The orientation of public sector investmenrs was partly affected
by the Government's takeover of Pertamina's projects in the non-oil sector,
but was also a result of its attempt to raise investment rapidly in response
to the sharply rising oil revenues. It was easier and quicker to develop
capital-intensive projects, plans for several of them in fact existed even
before the improvement in public finances. on the other hand, new projects
in such sectors as rural development, transmigration, health and education
generally required not only innovation but also the sctting up of new insti-
tutions.  The Government continues to view this orientation of its investment
program with concern, particularly in light of the recent stagnation of
Government savings. As part of its efforts to rescue Pertamina from bankruptcy,
it initiated a careful review of all public sector investment proposals anid
strengthened its control over the direction of investments. Where practicable,
the Government rejected or scaled down costly proposals. The budget for
1977/78 provides for a larger share of development expenditures in such sectors
,-as agriculture, health, family planning, education and regional developmenit.



10.       Reliable data on recent trends in employment are not available.
The labor force has been increasing at a rate of more than one million
persons a year, but the current level of unemployment and the extent of
underemployment are not known. While considerable investment activity
is in evidence in urban and rural areas of Indonesia, there is no indication
that the labor market has tightened or that the wages of unskilled workers
have more than kept pace with domestic inflation. However, the Government's
efforts at family planning appear to have yielded impressive results.
Preliminary estimates from an inter-censal survey in 1976 indicate that since
1971 the birth rate in Java and Bali has significantly declined.
11.       The prospects for Indonesia's exports in the short and medium
term are somewhat less favorable than previously expected. In particular,
there is a growing doubt as to whether crude oil production will rise much
above the current level of 1.7 million barrels per day during the next few
years. Also, most of the large non-oil, mineral projects for export develop-
ment are experiencing production or implementation delays, which will defer
their contribution to foreign exchange earnings to the middle or end of the
next decade. On the other hand, LNG and fertilizer exports are being effected
a little earlier than expected. The implications of recent developments for
imports, net foreign exchange earnings and future capital inflow requirements
are currently under study, but, for the most part, it would appear that the
quantities available for export rather than foreign demand will constitute
the principal constraint. Nevertheless, it should not be difficult for
Indonesia to meet its debt service obligations, and still to finance essential
imports of consumer, intermediate and capital goods. To maintain the pace of
development, however, Indonesia will continue to need a substantial inflow of
foreign assistance on concessional terms.
12.       External borrowing in 1977 has remained well within the limit of
$2 billion that had been recommended in the last Bank Economic Report. At
the meeting of the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) in April 1977,
aid pledges of over $500 million from bilateral sources were made. The likely
commitments from those IGGI donor countries which did not pledge, from the
multilateral agencies and from OPEC and East European countries should raise
the total of official development assistance to $1.5 billion. In the course
of 1977 foreign exchange reserves, as mentioned above, have increased sub-
stantially as a result of favorable export developments in 1976/77.
13.       The long-term consequences of the Pertamina crisis remain in the
form of large foreign debt and some burdensome investment projects. The
heavy foreign borrowing in 1975 and 1976 has raised the level of debt service,
which is now projected to reach $1.6 billion in 1978 or more than 18% of
projected export earnings compared to 13% in 1976. This does not take into
account the $255.8 million settlement incurred with regard to the hire
purchase of tankers, which is to be repaid in four equal annual installments
between now and 1980, interest free. However, a large cash loan made by a
syndicate of private banks in 1975 to help resolve the Pertamina crisis was
recently rolled over on more favorable terms. This provides an indication



of Indonesia's improved creditworthiness rat-ng on international capital
markets and should also ensure a reduction by 1980 in Indonesia's debt service
ratio to under 13%. Nonetheless, our previous conclusion, that in order to
keep the debt service burden manageable, commercial borrowing should be kept
to a minimum, remains valid. Net resource transfers from abroad are expected
to decline from $1.56 billion in 1976/77 to about $640 million in 1980/81, or
from about 5% to 1% of GNP,  In order to maintain the high rate of domestic
investment already reached, the Governmen' would need to raise substantial
additional revenue over the next few years, the bulk of which would have to
come from non-oil sources. The additional revenue raising effort is also
necessary to keep inflation under control0
14.        On balance the medium-term outlook for the Indonesian economy remains
favorable. Over the last eight years, GNP rose at an average rate of 7.5% a
year, and food production expanded in step, except for the past three years.
This rate of growth could be maintained in future provided that the rate of
investment continues to be high and the orientation of investments is shifted
to less capital-intensive forms. Thus, the Government's efforts in mobilizing
domestic resources and in careful investment planning would be crucial in
maintaining the relativeiy high rate of economic growth and creation of
employment opportunities. The Government also needs to pay special attention
to the production of rice, and food crops generally, so that the recent
setbacks do not recur.
PART II - WORLD BANK OPE>ahTTON IN INDONESIA
15.       The discussion in Part I c.f this report underscores the need for a
development program which provides zroduct:;ve work opportunities (with resul-
tant increased incomes) for Indonesia"s presently underemployed and growing
labor force. Major efforts are needed to 'rncrease labor-intensive employment
and programs directed towards improving the incomes of the poor and their
living standards.  To assist the Governwenlt ir. attaining its goals the Bank
is planning to increase its commitmenfs  eo Tndonesia and in particular to
support projects designed to; improve agricuiltural credit; rehabilitate and
expand irrigation systems; assist transmigration and other land development
outside Java and Bali for smallhoLders, increase nonagricultural employment
in the rural areas and small towns through the establishment of small-scale
industries; develop the electric power- sys.eia; construct: urgently needed
water supply and transport facili ties; expand the national family planning
program; and improve higher educaticoa programs, particularly for technicians
and accountants.
16.       As of November 30, 1977, Indones la had received 37 IDA credits
totaling $561.8 million and 30 Bank Ioans amount-ing to $1,417.0 million. At
that date, IFC investments totaled $6Lo 3 million. The share of the Bank
Group in Indonesia's total external. debt ,disbursed) outstanding at the end
of 1976 was about 6% and the share of debt service was less than 1%. By 1978
these ratios are expected to increase to around 12% and 5%, respectively.
Annex III contains a summary of IDA Credits, Bank Loans and IFC Investments as
of November 30, 1977, as well as notes on the execution of ongoing projects.



- 6 -
17.       To date, agriculture accounts for just over one-third of all Bank
lending to Indonesia, including four IDA credits for estate rehabilitation,
ten Bank loans and IDA credits for the rehabilitation and expansion of the
irrigation systems, two for fisheries, and one each for seeds production,
beef cattle, sugar, smallholder tea, smallholder rubber, agricultural research,
food crop extension services, transmigration, nutrition development and nucleus
estates and smallholders. In the industrial sector, the Bank has assisted in
three projects to expand PUSRI's fertilizer production and distribution
capacity, five for development finance institutions (Government-owned and
private) which play a major role in fostering the growth of industrial enter-
prises, and one for the Pulo Gadung industrial estate. Loans and credits
have also been extended to the following sectors:' education (including
technical, agricultural and non-formal education, teacher training, textbook
production and vocational and public service training); telecommunications;
tourism; power generation and distribution; transportation (including highways,
inter-island shipping and ports); population, urban; and water supply. Also
a loan was extended for a national resource survey and mapping project and
four credits for technical assistance to aid the Government in preparing and
formulating its development programs and projects.
18.       Bank lending to Indonesia started with an IDA credit in 1968 for
irrigation rehabilitation, with lending on Bank terms commencing in June 1974
Disbursements on loans and credits are now at satisfactory levels.
The Indonesian authorities have become increasingly aware of the cost to the
country of the delays in project execution caused by cumbersome procedures
and the need to establish an effective control system in Bappenas (the
National Development Planning Agency). At the Government's request, the Bank
arranged in 1974 for assistance under the Fourth Technical Assistance Credit
(Cr. 451-IND) to help set up a monitoring and control system. It is hoped
that the system which is now in operation will lead to better project
administration.
19.       The proposed loan is the third presented to the Executive Directors
this fiscal year and would bring total lending to Indonesia this year to
$189 million. Projects for small enterprise credit, rural credit, irrigation
and nucleus estates and smallholders are expected to be ready for presentation
in the next several months.
Performance Under Earlier Bank Operations
20.       IDA has made three credits and the Bank three loans totalling
$101 million and $247 million, respectively for the Indonesian power sector.
The main objective of these operations has been to provide funds for a
balanced power distribution/generation program in the Jakarta and West Java
area and to strengthen PLN organizationally and financially. Three projects
(Credits 165- and 334-, and Loan 1259-IND) for the rehabilitation and expansion
of the distribution facilities in the greater Jakarta area and three for power
generation (Credit 399-, and Loans 1127- and 1365-IND) in the same area (Muara
Karang) were undertaken to help PLN in commencing the necessary modernization
programs in and around the capital city. Funds were also provided for a



- 7 -
number of consulting services, including the large management consulting
effort of SOFRELEC of France (the basis for the "Financial Recovery Plan" -
para. 42), the Java System Development Study undertaken by Preece, Cardew and
Rider (PCR) of the United Kingdom, field studies of the 1,400 MW Saguling
hydroelectric project and the West Java (Suralaya) thermal power project
(ultimately 3,000 MW) and the study for a Java Extra High Voltage
Interconnection.
21.       PLN's performance in implementing the above projects was uneven
during the period 1969 through about 1975. The earlier distribution projects
(Credits 165- and 334-IND) are now expected to be completed about two years
behind schedule. Credit 165-IND is fully disbursed; as of November 30, 1977
ahout $2.0 million remains undisbursed under Credit 334-IND. PLN's inexperience
in project implementation in the early stages of these projects was as much
to blame for the delay as was the lack of coordination between PLN and the city
planning department of the municipality of Jakarta; this made it virtually
impossible for the consultants to design a distribution project for speedy
implementation.   Similarly, construction of the first three 100 MW units at
the Muara Karang thermal station (Credit 399- and Loan 1127-IND) has fallen
behind schedule by about two years. Cost overruns and consequent time-consuming
efforts to obtain the required funds from the Government and difficulties in
awarding contracts were the main reasons for the delay.
22.       Project implementation has improved since 1975 and progress,
although still sometimes slow, is encouraging. The delays mentioned in the
preceding paragraph, coupled with PLN's past operational deficiencies (the
effect of which is now apparent particularly in its lack of progress in
reducing its system losses and in increasing its sales) largely obscure the
considerable progress in a number of areas, chiefly the improvements in
financial performance which PLN has achieved; further progress is expected in
future as the benefits of earlier projects materialize.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
Energy Resources
23.       Indonesia has several alternative sources of energy - hydroelectric,
oil, natural gas, coal and geothermal. The hydroelectric potential is
estimated to be large (31,000 MW), of which only 1.5% is presently utilized.
With a few exceptions, unfavorable location of potential hydroelectric sites
and long gestation periods involved limit hydroelectric development in
Indonesia in the near future. A small pilot geothermal plant (30 MW) *is to
be set up in Java in collaboration with New Zealand; if successful, it could
lead to the development of an important non-fuel energy source in Java,
Sumatra and Sulawesi. The country also has substantial reserves of oil and
natural gas and intensive exploration is being carried out to assess the
total oil potential. Current production of oil is about 1.7 million barrels
per day. For electricity generation the country uses mostly fuel oil,, the
greater part of which is imported. Annual production of natural gas is about
20 trillion cubic meters, mainly for export in liquified form but also for
domestic production of fertilizer and petro-chemicals.



- 8 -
24.       Indonesia's coal reserves are also estimated to be large, about
1.2 billion tons, but actual coal production in 1974 was only about 250,000
tons. Prior to World War II, the production was of the order of two million
tons per year. Recent oil price increases have spurred efforts to increase
production for domestic use, primarily for electricity generation. As a
result of these efforts, a resurgence of coal production is expected with
major implications for the power sector. As one important step in this
direction the Bank has been asked to assist in financing an integrated coal
mine development and transportation project in Sumatra with an estimated
output of about 2.5 million tons per year to be used in a proposed new
thermal power station (Suralaya) in West Java.
The Power Sector
25.       In the last few years, Indonesia's overall economic growth outpaced
the development of the country's public power sector, which suffered from
both financial and implementation constraints. Consequently, Indonesia
now consumes less electricity per capita than most other developing countries;
estimates show that per capita installed capacity, excluding that of the
captive market, was only about 13 watts in 1975/76 and per capita sales about
30 kWh compared to about 114 kWh in India. System losses (station consump-
tion plus transmission and distribution losses) are still high at about 25%.
The distribution of energy sales among the various consumer classes has also
been different from other countries; in 1974/75 sales to industrial consumers
accounted for only 30% of energy sold, as compared to about 70% in Malaysia
and Taiwan and about 50% in Pakistan. Absence of a reliable public power
supply has forced most industrial consumers to install their own captive
generating capacity, which taken together are equal in capacity to that of
the public power sector. These small installations constitute an inefficient
use of the country's financial and energy resources, and explains why the
Government, with the assistance of the Bank and other external lenders, has
allocated a sizeable part of its budget to development of an efficent central-
ized public power supply system over the last few years. The results have
been encouraging, and the Government is now embarking on a new major investment
program requiring total financing estimated at about $13 billion equivalent
over the next nine years to enable the national power authority (Perusahaan
Umum Listrik Negara = PLN) to meet about 80% of the country's electricity
requirement by 1985.
Existing Public Power Facilities
26.       Under an investment program financed in part by six Bank loans and
credits, PLN has rehabilitated the badly deteriorated electric power distribu-
tion system in Jakarta and its environs and increased its installed generating
capacity. It has also improved its organizational capabilities and financial
situation.
27.       At the end of FY77 PLN's total installed generating capacity,
including the 125 MW Juanda hydro plant owned by the Jatiluhur Authority, was
1,502 MW, consisting of 30% hydro, 17% steam, 22% diesel and 31% gas turbine
capacity. About 75% of PLN's generating capacity is in Java. There are



- 9 -
presently three isolated power systems in Java - West, Central and East -
but the West and Central Java systems will be interconnected by 1980 and all
of Java by 1981. The distances involved,however, will limit inter-regional
power transfers to about 100 MW. (The attached Map No. IBRD 12435R1 shows
the existing 150 kV system and the major extension committed and under
construction). More effective higher voltage interconnection at either 400
kV or 500 kV is, therefore, planned for the mid-eighties.
The Power Market
28.       Several attempts have been made in recent years to prepare a
reliable demand forecast as a basis for the development of public power
supply in Indonesia. The most detailed assessment of tne underlying demand
/1 in Java was made during 1974-76 by Preece, Cardew and Rider: (PCR) of the
United Kingdom as a part of the comprehensive Java System Development Study
(financed under Credit 399-IND). The study contains two sets of projections;
a high forecast that is based on the assumption that publicly owned generating
capacity will meet the entire underlying demand of absut 549000 GWh by 1990
and the other which assumes the development of furtfier captive plant and
forecasts a lower rate of growth of public supply to about 34.,000 Glh irn the
same year.  PLN's future sales, in the short and medium term, -'ill depend
entirely on the rate at which PLN is capable of connecting to its system an
increasing portion of the existing demand; in the long term  its sales will
reflect more accurately the growth of power demand based on the overall level
of economic development.
29.       In 1976, PLN and the Bank accepted the PCR lower f!eczst .s a
guideline for planning PLN's development. An optimized progranr of generation
and transmission expansion to meet this demand forecast is also included in
the PCR study. Present indications are that even the lower rate of growth of
public power supply appears too optimistic, and targets have been lowered
accordingly. The latest such forecast of PLN's sales, mafe in August 1977,
is about 20% lower than PCR's low forecast in 1983, but catches up with it by
1990.  Accordingly, the rate of growth of PLN's sales is expected to increase
from about 17% in 1978 to about 22% in 1983 while PLN's share o-i the total
market would increase from about 50% to about 80%; after 1983 the rate of
growth would gradually decline to about 15% per year.
Future Development
30.       Power sector development in Indonesia has now reached a stage
where very large investments are required and coordinated system planning is
essential.  The main sector objectives at this stage are,  (a) to ensure that
PLN expands its sales in step with the growth of its getiera-ionr  Lransmission
and distribution facilities; and (b) to obtain by systez. plaenlug and a
program of improvement of its operationlal efficiency the iowest poLsiLe
future cost of supply.
/1  The demand PLN would have served if its installations had been adequate
and all self-supplied installations had been served by PlN.



- 13 -
31.       A generation development program for 1978-1986 has been prepared
by PLN and submitted to the Government in August 1977. This program is based
mainly on the most economic projects outlined in the PCR study, rescheduled
to take into account likely commissioning dates of the projects and the latest
demand forecast. This program was reviewed at negotiations and an under-
standing was reached with the Government and PLN that the program would be
used by PLN to plan its future investments during 1978-1986 and in particular
to initiate the preparatory steps which are required for timely implementa-
tion of the projects included in the program. The program will be reviewed
annually with the Bank (Section 4.02 [b] of the draft Loan Agreement).
32.       PLN's overall operational performance and system planning capability
are still weak and imbalances have developed between generation, transmission
and distribution facilities. In order to ensure that its future development
program is continuously updated and properly balanced, PLN had agreed under
Loan 1365-IND:
(a) to adopt the lower forecast of the Java System Development Study
as a guideline for power development in Java until 1983/84. (Under
the proposed project (Section 4.02 [a] of the draft Loan Agreement)
this target date has been postponed to 1986/87);
(b) to review annually with the Bank the potential changes in the load
growth and the variations of its development program for Java that
are required as a result of such changes; and
_(c) to review annually with the Bank its investment budget for the next
fiscal year before final Government approval thereof.  This would
enable the Bank to express its views on the priorities assigned to
the investments included in the budget and on the resulting balance
among generation, transmission and distribution investments.
33.       Under the proposed loan, the Government and PLN have further agreed
to take the necessary steps to implement the program as annually reviewed
with the Bank (Section 4.02 (b] of the draft Loan Agreement).
34.       As noted earlier, the increase in PLN's share of the underlying
power market will depend largely on the rate at which it connects new
customers. Now that PLN has built up adequate facilities, it should adopt an
aggressive marketing program, an essential component of which will be its
connection policy. PLN has agreed to review annually with the Bank its
customer connection program for the following fiscal year and subsequently
to make every effort to adhere to the agreed program (Section 2.08 of the
draft Project Agreement). The Bank staff will assist PLN in formulating such
an efficient customer connection policy.
35.       PLN's operational performance is reflected in its current system
losses (about 25%) and has not improved significantly since the early 1970s.
With Bank assisted and other distribution and expansion programs beginning
to take over the demands of the older systems hitherto heavily overloaded,



- 11 -
the situation should improve markedly in the future. A detailed program
designed to reduce system losses was prepared by PLN and reviewed with the
Bank during negotiations. This program outlines specific measures to pro-
gressively achieve a target of total system losses of about 21% by 1985/86.
In addition, an understanding was reached that PLN would further refine this
program by setting out measures for annual progress, with breakdowns by
category - generation, transmission and distribution - and by regions
separately indicated and that it would discuss with the Bank these specific
subsectoral and regional targets.
36.       Finally, to improve its system planning capability, PLN is also
strengthening the existing small system planning unit through recruitment of
additional staff and special training and scholarship programs.
Beneficiary
37.       The beneficiary of the proposed project would be Perusahaan Umum
Listrik Negara (PLN), the national power company of Indonesia. PLN is a
public enterprise (Perum), responsible for power development throughout the
country; it reports to the Ministry of Public Works and Electric Power,
and carries out its objectives within the National Development Program in
accordance with Government policies. The Minister determines PLN's policy
and exercises general control over its activities. In making decisions on
important matters he is assisted by an Advisory Board consisting of the
Ministers of Finance, Industry, and the Chairman of the National Development
Planning Agency (BAPPENAS).
38.       PLN is a semi-autonomous organization and has generally been able
to carry out its operations with considerable independence. Drafts of power
development plans and of regulations on standardizations safety and licensing
of captive plant are prepared and contracts for purchase or sale of electricity
are signed by PLN. However, the draft regulations must be approved and made
public by the Government to gain legal force. PLN's investment plans and
tariffs must be approved by the Government, which also exercises control over
the evaluation of bids and award of contracts financed through the Government
budget.
Organization and Management
39.       PLN's management (Board of Directors) consists of a President
Director and five other Directors responsible for planning, operation,
construction, finance and administration, including personnel. The members
of the Board are appointed and dismissed by the President of the Republic of
Indonesia upon the recommendation of the Minister. The President Director is
responsible to the Minister, while the other Directors report on their
respective fields to the President Director.
40.       The organization appears effective.  It places the responsibility
for day-to-day operation and construction implementation on PLN's Regional



- '2 -
Managers, who report directly to the Board of Directors. This delegation of
responsibility is particularly important in the light of the large area PLN
has to cover and the long distances involved. While it places a large work
load on the Board of Directors, the organization appears appropriate for PLN.
41.       In certain areas, for instance accounting, annual reports and
maintenance of statistics, PLN's performance has improved significantly in
recent years. Overall project implementation has also improved. However,
while some pogress in operational efficiency and system planning has been
made, it has not been as rapid as expected due to the magnitude and difficulty
of the task involved.
Financial Aspects of PLN
42.       Past Performance.  PLN's past financial performance has been
closely linked with the management consulting effort and the Financial
Recovery Plan (FRP) included in Credit 399-IND (1973). The objective of the
FRP was to achieve full revenue/cost coverage in FY79, with interim targets
of 80% in FY75 and 90% in FY77.
43.       In the implementation of the FRP, PLN has performed well and full
revenue cost coverage was achieved three years earlier than originally
planned (in FY76 instead of FY79) mainly because of tariff increases aggre-
gating 214% between FY71 and FY77. Consequently, under the proposed loan the
conventional financial targets discussed below have been substituted for the
FRP and all references to the FRP in earlier loan documents have been deleted.
44.       Financial Targets After Recovery.  Bearing in mind that the revenue/
cost targets of the FRP were of a temporary nature, PLN agreed in connection
with Loans 1259- and 1365-IND to develop, in consultation with the Bank, a
system of conventional financial targets to apply after financial recovery
had been achieved. Such targets were prepared over the past several months,
taking into account PLN's special circumstances which are characterized
by:
(a) heavy operating costs due to small and fragmented sub-systems
spread out over vast areas, outdated installations, gas-turbine
operation for base load, and high system losses;
(b)  a large investment program to be added to a comparatively small
asset base; and
(c) a decision to finance a reasonable share of new assets by debt
and through internally generated funds.
45.       Consequently, PLN has agreed that it will take the necessary steps
to generate during consecutive three-year periods from 1977/78 through 1983/84,
sufficient funds from internal sources as contribution to its capital expend-
itures at such levels as shall be agreed with the Bank and for periods from



- 13 -
1982/83 through 1984/85 and thereafter the level of such funds will be
equivalent to not less than 30% of the capital expenditures (Section 4.04 of
the draft Project Agreement). An understanding was reached that PLN would
make all efforts to cover the following interim percentages of its capital
expenditures from interal cash generation:
Periods                                   Percentages
Fiscal years 1976/77-1978/79                   17%
Fiscal years 1979/80-1981/82                   21%
Fiscal years 1981/82-1983/84                   25%
In order to take into account factors which may adversely affect PLN's
ability to produce the required funds from internal sources, the above ratios
for 1976/77 to 1983/84 will be periodically reviewed between the Bank and PLN.
46.       In addition PLN agreed to maintain a debt/equity ratio of not more
than 60:40 and a debt service coverage of 1.3 to avoid excessive medium-term
borrowing and to keep overall borrowing at reasonable levels (Sections 4.05 and
4.06 of the draft Project Agreement).
47.       At the end of its fiscal year 1985/86, PLN's gross fixed assets are
estimated to be about ten times the 1977 level. The rate of return on average
net fixed assets in operation is projected to increase to about 8% in fiscal
year 1983 and remain at about this level thereafter, which is satisfactory.
48.       PLN's Financing Plan.  PLN plans to implement an investment program
with an estimated total financing requirement of about $13 billion equivalent
between 1978 and 1986, of which the proposed project represents only about
One percent. The financial projections based on the agreements mentioned in
para. 45 above indicate that during this nine year period, PLN's net internal
cash generation would cover about 29% (or $4.0 billion) of the total investment
costs. Despite the expected improvement in earnings, the equivalent of about
$9.0 billion will have to be raised through foreign loans and credits and
through the Government budget. The Government has agreed to provide PLN with
sufficient funds to finance PLN's capital expenditures as annually reviewed
and agreed with the Bank (Section 3.01 [b] of the draft Loan Agreement).
49.       Tariffs.  PLN's present average.price per kWh reflects approximately
the long-run marginal cost of energy supplied and is therefore acceptable but
the structure of the tariffs needs revision. Under previous operations it
was agreed that PLN would design a new tariff structure to become effective
not later than April 1, 1979. The Bank staff will assist PLN in designing
such a tariff structure. PLN has agreed that the new tariff structure will
continue to reflect as closely as possible the long-run marginal cost of
energy supplied (Section 4.07 of the draft Project Agreement).

PART IV - THE PROJECT
50.       The project, which will enable PLN to meet the increase in load
forecast for Java by 1982/83 by adding 200 MW to its generating capacity, was
prepared by PLN and appraised by a Bank mission which visited Indonesia in
March and August 1977. A report entitled "Indonesia - Perusahaan Umum
Listrik Negara - Appraisal of the Seventh Power Project" (No. 1638-IND,
dated January 19, 1978) based on its findings is being distributed separately.
Supplementary project data are given in Annex III. The negotiations were
held in Washington, DoC. on November 28 - December 14, 1977; Mr. Ely Soengkono,
Secretary General of the Ministry of Public Works and Power, led the government
delegation.
Description of the Project
51.       The proposed project consists of construction of the third oil-fired
thermal power unit (200 MW) at the Semarang Harbor power station in Central
Java and its associated transmission lines and substations, consulting
services for engineering and procurement of major equipment for a new, dual
(coal and oil) fired thermal pourer station in West Java (Suralaya) and a
feasibility study and site investigations for a new dual (coal and oil) fired
thermal site in East Java.
52.       Two 50 MW oil-fired units presently under construction at the
Semarang Harbor site, are being financed by the Agency for International
Development (AID) of the United States. These units will be commissioned
early in 1978. The proposed Bank financed project will add a single, oil-
fired, thermal unit of 200 MW during the second half of 1982. A provision of
$3.0 million was made in Loan 1365-IND to cover engineering and design,
including preparation of bid documents and evaluation of bids for this third
unit at Semarang to ensure its timely implementation. The field work for the
Suralaya Thermal Power Station has been completed by Montreal Engineering
Company of Canada financed under Loan 1127-IND and conceptual designs are now
being prepared. With the engineering and procurement services financed under
the proposed loan, PLN would be able to meet the target date for commission-
ing of the Suralaya Station in early 1984.
Cost Estimates and Financing
53.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $161.5 million of
which $112.0 million (or 69%) would be in foreign exhchange. The cost
estimates include physical contingencies amounting to 5% of the total cost of
Semarang Unit 3 and the foreign exchange cost of transmission/ substations,
and to 10% of the local cost of the latter. Annual price contingencies have
been calculated at 7.5% (1977-79) and 7% (later years) on foreign costs and,
on average, at 10% on local costs. The prices are net of customs duties
since all imports financed from aid funds are exempt from payment of duties.



- 15 -
54.       The proposed loan of $109.0 million would cover the foreign
exchange cost of the project with the exception of the engineering services
($3.0 million) for Semarang Unit 3 which was financed under Loan 1365-IND.
The Government will make available the proceeds of the proposed loan to PLN
on the same terms as those of the Bank loan under a subsidiary loan agreement
acceptable to the Bank. In addition, interest during the grace period will
be capitalized, a procedure which is in line with financing practices in
public utilities. The signing of the subsidiary loan agreement is a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed loan (Section 6.01 (b) of the draft Loan
Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
55.       Procurement of materials and equipment would be on the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines
for procurement. Some participation by Indonesian equipment manufacturers is
expected, in which case a 15% margin of preference on the c.i.f. price, or
the prevailing duties, if lower, will be applicable for purposes of bid
comparison. In bid evaluation a 7.5% preference for domestic civil work
contractors for which Indonesia qualifies on the basis of its low per capita
GNP will also be applied.
56.       The proposed loan will be disbursed against the following items:
(a)  major equipment - 100% of foreign expenditures for directly
imported goods, 95% of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured
goods and 65% of the total expenditures for imported goods procured
locally (the latter two percentages represent prices net of taxes);
(b)  general construction:
(i) civil and structural works - 69% of total expenditures
(representing the estimated foreign cost);
(ii) ancillary mechanical and electrical works - 100% of foreign
expenditures; and
(c) consultants' services - 100% of foreign expenditures.
No disbursements will be made for expenditures prior to loan signing.
Engineering and Construction
57.       The project will be implemented by PLN, with the assistance of its
consultants, Black and Veatch International (BVI) of the United States. BVI
is already responsible for the work of engineering and design of Semarang
Unit 3 up to the stage of bid evaluation with financing under Loan 1365-IND;






- 17 -
63.       Thie proposed project is also expected to achieve further improve-
ments in the organization of PLN to enable it to cope with its growing
responsibilities.
64.       The internal economic rate of return (IERR) calculated by a discount
rate equalizing the economic costs and benefits attributable to the project is
about L9%, which is satisfactory. The world market price of fuel was used
in the cost stream, and incremental revenues based on the average 1977 price
of Rp 30.9 per kwh were used to measure benefits.
Ecology
65.       Indonesia has not yet ruled on matters of environmental quality.
The TS Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards are being used as
design criteria. Mtaximum particle concentration at ground level due to
exhaust eases will be below EPA standards, and a mechanical precipitator will
be sufficient to remove solid particles from the gas. Moreover, space will
be provided for future installation of electrostatic precipitators, should
they become necessary. Stack height will keep the sulfur pollution below EPA
standards even for high-sulfur Middle East oil, which may be used instead of
Indonesian low sulfur oil. Consultants will carry out surveys of atmospheric
and oceanographic conditions in the vicinity of the project area so that
conditions before and after thie plant installation will be monitored.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMIENTS AND AUTHORITY
66.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Indonesia and the
Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and Perusahaan Umum Listrik
Negara (PLN), and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
67.       In addition to the features of the Loan and Project Agreements
which are referred to in Section III of Annex III, the additional conditions
of effectiveness of the Loan (Section 6.01 of the draft Loan Agreement)
include:
(a) the execution of the Project Agreement on behalf of PLN has been
duly authorized or ratified by all necessary corporate and govern-
mental action; and
(b) the execution of the subsidiary Loan Agreement on behalf of the
Borrower and PLtl, respectively, has been duly authorized or ratified
by all necessary corporate and governmental action.



- 18 -
68.       T am satisfied that the proposed loan wqould comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
69.       1 recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /1
Credit No. 195   Second Irrigation Rehabilitation:  US$18.5 Million Credit
of June 15, 1970; Effective Date: December 31, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Initial progress was delayed by difficulties in equipment procure-
ment and civil works execution, and later, by rising construction costs. The
project is expected to be completed by March 1979. The credit is about 98%
disbursed. The rehabilitated and new facilities are technically sound and
hydraulically adequate. The quality of maintenance of completed works is
improving with the availability of operation and maintenance funds substan-
tially higher than previous levels. The estimated project cost has more than
doubled since appraisal due to high inflation rates and increases in contract
quantities, but the estimated economic rate of return remains satisfactory
because rice prices and yields have been higher than those projected during
appraisal.
Credit No. 220   Third Irrigation Rehabilitation:  US$14.5 Million Credit
of November 6, 1970; Effective Date: May 28, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Overall project completion is expected by about September 1978,
about 3 years years behind schedule. The problems which caused this delay -
difficulties in preparation of contract documents, late financial allocations,
heavy rains in the 1973 construction season and, more recently, high inflation
rates and consequent civil works cost overruns - have been overcome, but
time lost cannot be regained. The project is now essentially completed with
97% of the Credit disbursed. The quality of maintenance of completed works
is improving with the availability of operation and maintenance funds substan-
tially higher than previous levels. The estimated project cost is about twice
the appraisal estimate, but rice prices and yields substantially higher than
those projected at appraisal enable the project to achieve an estimated
economic rate of return of over 20%.
Credit No. 246  Seeds:   US$7.5 Million Credit of May 19, 1971;
Effective Date: December 7, 1971; Closing Date:
June 30, 1978.
At Sukamandi 1,600 ha have been developed and it is planned to develop
an additional area of 400 ha in 1978. Significant results as of 1976/77 season,
/1 These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

expressed as percentages of appraisal estimates are: (a) area under pro-
duction - 2,020 ha (54%), (b) yields of rice seed - 2.9 tons/ha (72%), and
(c) production of certified seed - 4,900 tons (42%). Due to cost escalations
and implementation difficulties, only one seed multiplication district,
Klaten, out of the three planned at appraisal, has been developed. Total
area developed so far is 250 ha of a total estimate of 500 ha. National
Seeds Corporation's cost of production continues to be high and it is not
commercially viable even with increases in production. The Corporation will
need continued financial support from the Government.
Credit No. 259  Tea:   US$15 Million Credit of June 24, 1971; Effective
Date: September 17. 1971; Closing Date:
June 30, 1978.
Nearly all the targets set at appraisal have been achieved one year
before project completion, but factory capacity still has to be increased
to take account of the increased production which exceeds appraisal estimates
by about 5,000 tons or 25%. Inflation and additional construction and
equipment costs are expected to increase project costs by about 17% above
appraisal estimate.
Credit No. 260   Second Highway:  US$34 Million Credit of June 24, 1971;
Effective Date: August 10, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31J1978.
Quality of work is satisfactory and cost overruns have been rela-
tively small (despite sharp price increases) due to efforts to reduce
construction quantities, and to cost savings for consulting services.
Construction work is completed; but work is still proceeding on detailed
engineering of the Padang-Medan Road, the initiation of which was delayed to
reconsider road design standards in relation to those recently developed for
the highway betterment program and to take into account IDA's recommendations
regarding standards for urban portions of the road.
Credit No. 288   Second Education:  US$6.3 Million Credit of March 9,
1972; Effective Date: June 7, 1972;
Closing Date: March 30, 1978.
The project is being implemented with minor delay. All civil
works, delivery of furniture and equipment and expert services are virtually
completed. Progress of the fellowship program and teacher training is also
satisfactory. The Government has made budgetary provisions to meet the cost
overruns. Disbursements have improved. Delayed implementation required
postponement of the Closing Date by 15 months to March 30, 1978.

Credit No. 289   Fourth Irrigation Rehabilitation:  US$12.5 Million Credit
of March 9, 1972; Effective Date: May 5. 1972; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978.
The construction program has escalated in cost by 190% over the
appraisal estimate due to an increase in the magnitude of the works and price
escalation due to unexpected inflation. About 70% of the works are finished
and completion of the project is expected by March 1979. The Credit is
about 92% disbursed. Feasibility studies included in the project have been
concluded and groundwater investigations are nearing completion.
Credit No. 300   Population:  US$13.2 Million Credit of April 20, 1972;
Effective Date: November 2, 1972; Closing Date:
June 30, 1978
The national family planning program, of which the project is an
integral part, is expanding in terms of the numbers of new acceptors recruited
annually and now covers about 18% of all married women in the reproductive
age group. Implementation of the civil works component is now on schedule.
Credit No. 318   Inter-Island Fleet Rehabilitation:  US$8.5 Million
Credit of June 28, 1972; Effective Date: October 19,
1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1978.
At the request of the Government the Closing Date has been postponed
to September 30, 1978 in order to provide additional time for several new
projects of ship rehabilitation and the technical assistance to be developed.
Due to sharply increased costs and lack of creditworthy applicants, just over
half the tonnage of shipping expected at appraisal will be rehabilitated.
Credit No. 319   Fourth Agricultural Estates:  US$11 Million Credit of
June 28, 1972; Effective Date:  January 30, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
Progress of the project continues to be good with planting of
rubber and oil palm ahead of appraisal estimates and in excellent condition.
The project has been expanded to l5,000 ha (originally 11,400 ha). The
remaining area to be planted is about 3,500 ha of which 2,300 ha have been
cleared and are ready for planting in early 1978. Technical problems exist
in processing and equipment maintenance but construction of the oil palm mill
will be accelerated and additional capacity for crumb rubber production will
also be provided. Profitability and cost of development at PNP X are satis-
factory, while the capital structure of PNP X is to be improved during the
course of the Nucleus Estates and Smallholders I Project.(NES I -
Loan 1499-IND) PNP X is participating in both the NES I project and the
Transmigration and Rural Development Project (Loan 1318-IND).

Credit No. 334   Second Electricity Distribution:   US$40 Million Credit
of September 29, 1972; Effective Date:  March 12, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
The Jakarta distribution program financed from Credits 165-IND
and 334-IND (together $55 million) encountered setbacks in implementation
due to delays in the preparation of designs for the system expansion because
of constantly changing city development plans during the early period of
implementation, procurement problems and cumbersome management procedures.
As a result the project is two years behind the original schedule. These
difficulties have been resolved and recent progress is encouraging. The
Closing Date has been postponed from December 31, 1977 to June 30, 1978
to allow additional time for the delivery of some recently ordered goods.
Completion of voltage changeover and connection of consumers will require
another 12 months after Closing Date.
Credit No. 355   Beef Cattle Development:  US$3.6 Million Credit of
January 31, 1973; Effective Date: May 30, 1973;
Closing Date: September 30, 1980.
Several problems have seriously delayed project implementation.
Government's budget allocation has been insufficient, and financial manage-
ment and coordination have been weak. The January 1977 review mission's
recommendations, which included major changes in project scope and objectives,
were approved by the Executive Directors in June 1977, These amendments
reflected a change in the project from one of breeding and fattening of beef
cattle for export to that of production of improved cattle for domestic sale
as draft and breeding animals. The project was reveiwed in November 1977 and
the mission found the state of ranch development and management satisfactory.
Credit No. 358   North Sumatra Smallholder Development:  US$5 Million Credit
of February 14, 1973; Effective Date: August 13, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
Progress of this project continues to be satisfactory, and the full
program of planting 9,000 ha of rubber and oil palm by smallholders was
completed by the end of 1977. By 1981, when the project is completed, these
plantings will have been brought to maturity. Government has decided not to
expand the project in its present location because of the extensive support
already given to North Sumatra Province through this and other Bank supported
projects; instead, Government is seeking the Bank's assistance for smallholder
development projects in other Provinces, including Aceh, Jambi, Riau, S. Sumatra,
W. Kalimantan and S. Kalimantan.

Credit No. 387   Third Education:  US$13.5 Million Credit of June 1, 1973;
Effective Date: August 29, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project finances the production and distribution of 138 million
primary school textbooks, and related in-service training for 350,000 primary
school teachers. Printing of 81 million textbooks has been completed,
generally about nine months behind schedule. Similar delays are expected in
the printing of 31 million books for 1977/78, due in part to delays in paper
procurement. Teaching equipment has been procured and delivered. Teacher
training is on schedule and 3,800 tutors and administrators and 370,000
teachers have participated in training seminars. Due to delays in book
production, it has proved difficult to keep the training program in phase
with book deliveries. Project management has been strengthened by addition
of Indonesian staff to a reorganized project unit, and by recruitment of
specialists under a technical assistance contract signed with UNESCO. The
Government is presently seeking additional technical assistance in publishing
and paper procurement. Disbursement has improved and is now 91% of the
appraisal estimate as against 69% a year ago. The Government is planning a
major review of the project to focus on its relation to other ongoing Govern-
ment textbook projects and to overall future needs for production of
instructional materials.
Credit No. 388   Third Highway:  US$14 Million Credit of June 1, 1973;
Effective Date: June 25, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Construction work on the two North Sulawesi road sections in the
project was started early in 1974 under two contracts. Contractors have been
delayed mainly because of long mobilization periods and unusually adverse
climatic conditions. Construction costs will likely exceed original estimates
by more than 100%, mainly caused by increased quantities combined with
sharply escalated prices. The project also included feasibility and detailed
design studies of highway betterment works. Most of the studies are now
completed and formed the basis of the Fourth Highway Project (Loan 1236-IND).
However, work on a few studies will continue for another 3-4 months and will
then form the basis for lending by ADB or bilateral agencies. The training

Credit No. 399   West Java Thermal Power:  US$46 Million Credit of
June 22, 1973; Effective Date: August 28, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
Bids received for the first two 100 MW units at Muara Karang (Part
A of the Project) were about 65% higher than estimated at the time of
appraisal. This, together with construction cost increases, has resulted in
an increase in the total project cost of more than 100%. Government will
provide the additional 'unds required.  The additional financing requirements

led to a delay in the award of the general construction contract and, as a
result, the project is about twc years behind schedule. PLN has satisfactorily
met the targets in its financial recovery plan (Part B) provided for
under the terms of the Credit Agreementi  The Java System Study (Part C) has
been completed. The Citarum Hydroelectric Feasibility Study (Pard D) had to
be extended by another working season to complete additional field work. It
is likely that the Closing Date of the Credit will need to be postponed by
about 12 months.

Disbursements are si'Jer than anticipated and are about a third of
appraisal estimates.  This ia, 3.ue to k-ewez than anticipated credit applica-
tions mainly because smaliholder tea price has been higher than anticipated
at appraisal, which reduce6 the nred .^-or subloans.  Also private estates have

June 26, 19713  Effective Date:  April 22, 1974;
Closing  Date:  June 30_ 1979.
The project is on schedule and about 75% completed.  The Joint
Sugar Projects Unit is efficiently supervising the procurement and installa-
tion of machinery and equipment. The Lwo PTPs which are involved in the
rehabilitation process are both in a w_ak financial position and this
problem requires attention. Consultant6 services are gradually being phased
out as planned except for the sugar research station which still requires a
major input.
Credit No. 428   Pula GaduaR Xadustrial Estate:  US$16.5 Million Credit
of September 14, 1973; Effective Date: November 13,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The estate is progressing satisfactorily. Of 430 ha of raw land
earmarked for acquisition, 290 ha hod been acquired as of May 1977 and



ANNEX II
Page 10 of 18 pages
acquisition of another 31 ha is under negotiation. 104 ha of the 129 ha of
developed land have been sold to 83 firms. Factory employment at full capa-
city will be around 17,000 and an estimated 1,400 are employed on the average
in both factory construction and land development. Overall, operations are
rofitable. The return on capital investment, which is now projected to be
:?0.6%, is significantly higher than the appraisal forecast of 13.4%. This is
due to the fact that developed land values are rising faster than the cost
of raw land and development.
Credit No. 436   Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia
(PDFCI): US$10 Million Credit of November 2, 1973;
Effective Date: March 6, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Despite a long start-up period and difficulties in recruiting
qualified staff, the project has progressed satisfactorily. The Credit is
fully committed.
Credit No. 451   Fourth Technical Assistance:  US$5 Million Credit of
January 2, 1974; Effective Date: February 15, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Progress under the project is satisfactory.
Credit No. 479   Bali Tourism:  US$16.0 Million Credit of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: December 4, 1974; Closing Date:
August 31, 1979.
The construction of major infrastructure for the Nusa Dua tourism
estate, including the hotel training school is under way and is scheduled for
completion in December 1978. The completion of project components outside
the estate (roads) is scheduled for October 1979, about one year later than
planned at project appraisal. Visitor traffic to Bali has increased rapidly
due to a considerable number of charter flights coming to Bali. Promotional
efforts to encourage investors have been intensified. Agreement has been
reached for the construction of the first 300-room hotel in Nusa Dua.
Credit No. 480   Fisheries Credit:  US$6.5 Million Credit of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: January 8, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
After some initial delays, the project has generally been progressing
satisfactorily. Construction of shore facilities at Ambon is virtually
completed. Boat construction is under way and all related equipment is on
site ready for installation. While the quality of fishpond lending has
suffered some deficiencies in the past, remedial action taken by Bank Rakyat
Indonesia is gradually improving the situation.

Credit No. 514   Jatiluhur Irrigation Ext:ension:  US$30 Million Credit
of October 3, 1974; Effective Date: January 10, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
Initial organizational difficulties and a delay in awarding the
first construction contract have caused a delay of about 2 years in the
project schedule. The first construction activity started in February 1977
and good progress has been achieved. The remaining contracts are expected to
be awarded in the next 6 months. Based on bid prices for the first contract
and revised quantity estimates on the basis of detailed design, the total
project cost is now estimated to be about 140% over the appraisal estimate.
Loan No. 1005 Railway: US$48.0 Million Loan of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: August 16, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Procurement is now well under way and almost all contracts have
been signed or are about to be signed. Project execution is behind schedule
due to initial slow procurement and execution of works. Freight and passenger
traffic declined in 1976, due largely to poor service. However slight
improvements were made in the second '.alf of 1977 after the arrival of new
locomotives and rolling stock, and with operations improved with the aid of
consultants. The financial performance of the railway deteriorated in 1976
and 1977 due mainly to the declining traffic and to an increase in cost
including a large wage raise in early 1977. The overall situation is being
reviewed with the railway administrators and the Government.
Loan No. 1040  Jakarta Urban Development:  US$25 Million Loan of
September 27, 1974; Effective Date:  January 15, 1975;
Closing Date:  March 31, I978,
The kampung improvement part of the project is substantially
complete. Some 2,080 ha have been upgraded as compared with the original
plan of 1,980 ha. The sites and services component is about 15 months behind
schedule. This is primarily due to land acquisition problems encountered in
the early stages of the project. Project costs for the sites and services
component are expected to be about 7% above the appraisal estimate. Some
problems have arisen with regard to the standard of materials and the procedures
to be utilized in allocating the plots, and these are being reviewed currently
by the Government.
Loan No. 1049 Five Cities Water Supply: USS14.5 Million Loan of
October 31, 1974; Effective Date: May 21, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Due to administrative and managerial problems the project is
running 18-24 months behind schedule. This delay together with higher rates
of inflation than anticipated is expected to increase project costs about 14%

above the appraisal estimate. Detailed engineering and preparation of tender
documents have been completed and the project has reached its construction
phase. The reorganization of the Directorate of Sanitary Engineering and the
establishment and development of local water enterprises are proceeding
satisfactorily.
Loan No. 1054 Development Finance Co. (BAPINDO II): US$50 Million
Loan of November 20, 1974; Effective Date: January 14,
1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The loan is expected to be fully committed in the fourth quarter of
1977. Despite significant institutional improvements achieved by BAPINDO,
the company has still a high level of arrears; its appraisal work is slow and
administrative costs are excessive. These problems are being addressed
through a Program of Action discussed and agreed among the Government,
BAPINDO and the Bank.
Loan No. 1089 Second Fertilizer Expansion: US$115 Million Loan of
February 28, 1975; Effective Date: April 29, 1975;
Closing Date: August 31, 1978.
The project (PUSRI III) was mechanically completed in December
1976, one month ahead of schedule. Some operational difficulties are yet to
be resolved. The PUSRI III gas system has been completed. Total cost of
PUSRI III is expected to be within the appraisal estimate.
Loan No. 1100 Sixth Irrigation: US$65 Million Loan of April 10,
1975; Effective Date: June 20, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1982r
Most of the project programs have advanced well during the past
year. Design of works for the Cirebon and Rentang subproject systems is
beyond the capability of PROSIDA to execute, and assistance has been provided
under Loan 1434-IND to expedite this work through the use of local consultants.
Critical review of the program for benefit monitoring is under way.
Loan No. 1127  Fourth Power:  US$41 Million Loan of June 17, 1975;
Effective Date: October 23, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1980,
Part A of the project provides for the expansion of the Muara
Karang thermal power station at Jakarta by addition of a third 100 MW
generating unit. The general construction contracts covering this unit as
well as the first two financed under Credit 399-IND have been awarded although
after some delay because of the problems of cost-overruns for the first two

units. The Financial Recovery Plan (Part B) and feasibility study for a new
thermal plant in West Java (Part C 1) have been completed. The Training
Program (Part D) is proceeding satisfactorily. Implementation of the project
is now satisfactory but final completion will be about 18 months behind the
original schedule.
Loan No. 1139 Fertilizer Distribution: US$68 Million Loan of
July 10, 1975; Effective Date: August 28, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
All the contracts for the original project have been let and most
materials and three ships have been delivered to Indonesia. Savings of about
$12.5 million from the loan were realized in the original project. Procurement
of an additional ship and bulk reception facilities to serve expansion of
fertilizer output beyond that anticipated at appraisal were approved by the
Executive Directors on April 5, 1977. The expanded project is under way and
is likely to be completed successfully.
Loan No. 1179 Agricultural Research and Extension: US$21.5 Million Loan
of December 19, 1975; Effective Date: February 23, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The project having suffered initial delays is about one year behind
the appraisal report schedule, but is now progressing satisfactorily.
Architects for civil works construction have now completed schematic drawings,
a contract for provision of technical assistance for research is under active
implementation and an agreement with FAO for technical assistance in extension
of agricultural information was signed in October 1977.
Loan No. 1197 National Resource Survey and Mapping Project: US$13.0 Million
Loan of February 5, 1976; Effective Date: April 2,
1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The project is essentially on schedule. Construction of BAKOSURTANAL
headquarters and facilities, including cartographic, printing, photographic
interpretation, and data processing wings, is about 50% complete. Contracts
covering about 40% of the equipment to be procured under the project have
been awarded. The first new topographic map sheets of Sumatra have been
completed, and an orderly schedule for several hundred additional sheets are
in various stages of compilation and production. Training programs and the
work of expert advisors engaged under the project are progressing well.
Final loan documents for a parallel CIDA financed project are in Jakarta,
awaiting government's signature.

Loan No. 1236  Fourth Highway Project:  US$130 Million Loan of April 15, 1976;
Effective Date:  August 13, 1976; Closing Date:  December 31,
1980.
Nearly all key activities in the initial implementation schedule
agreed with the Government have been completed, although with delays ranging
from nine months to about one year. Construction contracts for almost 900 km
of roads have been awarded, and tender evaluation has been completed for the
remaining about 380 km. Some problems in the execution of the road works
have been revealed on contracts started in 1976 but it is still too early to
assess the future impact of these difficulties on the overall construction
progress and project completion.
Loan No. 1237 Fourth Education Project: US$37 Million Loan of April 15,
1976; Effective Date: June 17, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
The project suffered initially a ten-month delay due to late
signing of the Funds-in-Trust agreements with the UN agencies providing
technical assistance and slow site selection. However, since January 1977,
no further delays have occurred and good progress is now being made in
implementation. Cumbersome implementation procedures in the Department of
Manpower are still a potential source of delay for that Department's sub-
project and should be kept under review. Architectural designs for all three
subprojects have been prepared by consultants and approved by the Bank. Most
sites have been acquired and surveyed. Construction firms have been prequal-
ified. Tenders for construction of 14 to 24 project institutions will be
called in the next six months. Equipment lists are in advanced stages of
preparation. Eleven additional technical assistance specialists assumed
their posts over the last six months and the technical assistance program is
proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan No. 1250 Second Shipping Project: US$54 Million Loan of May 20, 1976;
Effective Date: October 8, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
Delay in the appointments of a number of consultants, most of
which have now been made, has caused a slow start to the project and has
slowed project implementation and disbursements. The financial position of
the state shipping company (PELNI) is unsatisfactory, and further deterioration
could cause financial problems for the project entity (PANN). The Government
is considering steps to deal with this problem and with the acquisition of
high-cost new ships. Solutions likely to be proposed may require amendment
to the project description. It is expected that such a proposal will be
discussed with the Bank in March 1978.

Loan No. 1259 Fifth Power Project: US$90 Million Loan of May 20, 1976;
Effective Date: September 20. 1976; Closing Date:
March 31, 1981r
The procurement of equipment is under way but disbursement is
substantially behind schedule. Orders have been placed for the first of
three lots of equipment for about US$11.0 million; these are now being
received enabling field work to be commenced. Bids are being issued for the
second lot worth about US$40.0 million and arrangements for construction
altered to speed up implementation. Nevertheless a delay of about a year is
expected in completion of the Project, due to the slow start. Part B of the
Project (the financial recovery plan) has been completed.
Loan No. 1267 National Food Crops Extension Project; US$22 Million Loan
of June 4, 1976; Effective Date: September 21, 1976; Closing
Date: June 30, 1982.
The construction and procurement programs, after a somewhat slow
start, are now on schedule. Staff appointments are on schedule with the
exception of some supervisory staff and subject matter specialists outside
Java. The new extension methodology has been adopted in all project provinces
and is being gradually applied. The coordination of extension services between
the five directorates general in the Ministry of Agriculture has not been
finalised; this matter is being closely followed. Improvements in project
management, and accounting are also being sought.
Loan No. 1268 Seventh Irrigation Project: US$33 Million Loan of June 4,
1976; Effective Date: September 21, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31. 1981.

in 1978; 50 more houses are under construction and the remaining houses
should be started soon. Physical layout plans for Villages 3 and 4 have been
completed and will be reviewed with the Bank in January. Project progress is
generally satisfactory. Continued improvement is expected in project adminis-
tration following the appointment of consultants to the Project Management
Unit in mid-1977.

November 4, 1976; Effective Date: March 28, 1977; Closing Date:
March 31, 1980.
The progress of civil works is ahead of schedule, and costs are
generally within the estimates. Although land acquisition is causing some
delays, efforts are being made to speed up procedures. Progress is being
made in developing Government capabilities in undertaking a nationwide
kampung improvement program in the future.
