SEVENTH POWER PROJECT (Loan 1513-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Completion Report (PCR) for the project financed under
the Seventh Power loan to the Republic of Indonesia. The US$109 nillion loan,
which became effective on June 30,1978, was provided to finance the foreign
cost of a project consisting of the construction of one 200 MW oil-fired
generiting unit at Semarang in central Java, associated 150-kV transmission
lines and substation and consulting services for the above, as well as for
coal-fired power plants in West and East Java.
Although the construction of the power plant, transmission lines and
substations was completed by October 1983, disbursements, mainly for payments
of contractor's retention monies and procurement of spare parts, continued
till December 1985. The project cost was about 30% lower than estimated,
mainly due to lower than expected prices, in dollar terms, for imported
equipment. A cancellation of $15 million from the loan amount was effected in
December 1980, and the balance of the saving of $15.6 million was cancelled
when the loan was finally closed.
This report was prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Projects
Department, Energy Division, following missions in September 1985 and 1986.
It is based in part on completion reports prepared by the consultants retained
for the project.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performan-'
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft
report to the Borrower and the Executing Agency for comments. Couments
received from the Executing Agency have been reproduced as Attachment A to
the report.

SEVENTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1513-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
A US$109 million loan was made to the Republic of Indonesia in 1978
to finance the foreign expenditure for constructing one 200 MW oil-fired
generating unit at Semarang thermal power station in central Java,
construction of the associated 150 kV transmission lines and substations, and
consulting services for the detailed design, procurement and construction
supervision for the above (para. 2.04). The loan also financed consulting
seTvices for the coal-/oil- fired plant at Suralaya, feasibility study for a
coal-fired plant in East Java (Paiton), feasibility study for a Java-Sumatera
submarine interconnection, and the design of a management information system
(paras. 2.04 and 2.06). The Semarang unit was commissioned in September 1983
which was six months behind the appraisal schedule and 17 months behind the
revised schedule established subsequent to appraisal, and the transmission
lines and substations were commissioned progressively between July and October
1983, which were about 11 months behind the schedule (paras. 3.04 and 8.04).
Major reasons for project delay were delays in finalization of contracts,
unexpected difficulties in piling work, tatly performance of some contractors
and periodic shortage of local funds (paras. 3.03-3.05 and 8.04). There was a
cost underrun of about 30% in the overall project cost, primarily because of
the lower-than-estimated cost of imported equipment and materials in dollar
terms (para. 3.06).
The generating set at Semarang has been operating satisfactorily
with anticipated level of efficiency (paras. 4.01-4.04). The transmission
lines and substations are operating as designed (para. 4.08). The internal
economic rate of return of the project is 11X against the appraisal estimate
of 19%, mainly because of lower than anticipated utilization factor of oil
fired generating plant due to its high marginal production cost and low tariff
level in Rupiah terms due to the devaluation of the Indonesian currency in
September 1986 (para. 7.06). The studies included in the project formed the
basis of subsequent Bank lending for Suralaya coal fired power plant (Loan
1708-IND) (para. 4.09). Other studies, such as feasibility study of a coal
fired power plant in East Java, have been further developed in subsequent
operations to assist in future lending operation (para. 4.10).
During the project construction (1978-83), PLN's sales increased at
an average annual growth rate of 19%. The project was timely in meeting the
increased demand.
During the period 1980-84, the Government progressively eliminated
subsidies for the fuel oil by increasing domestic prices. The price of
residual fuel oil used in the power plants increased from about Rp 22 per
liter in 1978 to Rp 200 per liter in 1984, the current level being



- iv -
significantly above the international price. PLN has been permitted tariff
increases to compensate for the increases in fuel prices, but such increases
have generally lagged behind the fuel price increases, reflecting in PLN's
financial performance (paras. 5.07-5.08). PLN's future performance will
significantly depend on timely tariff adjustments, improvement in its
operating efficiency and the pace of institutional development to cope with
the increasingly complex task of managing the power utility.
PLN's institutional develormnxit has been impressive and various
initiatives are already in place for achieving further progress in various
fields. The issues which are being addressed are: improving operating
efficiency, strengthening corporate and financial planning, improving
engineering and design capabilities and manpower development and training
(paras. 6.01-6.08).



INDONESIA
SEVENTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1513-IND)
Project Completion Report
I. INTRODUCTION
The Power Sector
1.01      The generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in
Indonesia is the responsibility of PLN, a government-owned enterprise.
Captive power plants installed by private parties also play a predominant role
in the power sector, which in addition, comprises municipal franchises and
cooperatives supplying power in a few remote rural areas. The activities of.
the power sector are regulated by the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MHE)
established in 1978, through its Directorate General of Electric Power
(DCEP). By a legislation enacted in 1979, DGEP acquired from PLN the
responsibility for policy planning, licensing of franchises and general suler-
vision of the power sector. PLN started to function as an autonomous publis
corporation in 1972, when its status was changed from that of a department in
the ministry of public works to a public corporation. Thereafter, it under-
took the urgently needed rehabilitation and expansion programs. PLN's
subsequent growth was rapid and in 1985/86 it had about 5.9 million consumers
and supplied about 651 of the total electricity in the country. The growth in
generating capacity of PLY in Java since the time of appraisal in 1977/78 and
projected up to 1990/91, is shown in Table 1.1.

1.02      Following the steep increases in oil prices from 1979, diversifica-
tion away from oil was established as a policy objective and coal was estab-
lished as the primary fuel choice for thermal power plants. The first two
coal fired units with a capacity of 800 MW were commissioned in 1984 and
1985. Geothermal energy is also expected to play an increasing role in the
power sector; oil-fired capacity will be used for intermediate load factor
duties and gas turbines will be progressively phased out.
The Borrower/Beneficiary
1.03      The borrower was the Republic of Indonesia and loan proceeds were
on-lent to PLY on the same terms and conditions as those of the Bank loan.
The operations of PLN are managed by a board of directors (presently comprised
of five directors, respectively of planning, construction, operations, finance
and administration) headed by a President-Director, who is appointed by the
President and accountable to the Minister of Mines and Energy. The directors
perform more of a policy setting role, with line responsibility devolving from
the board as a whole to 16 regional operating managers and 30 construction
project managers. PLN's major policies and programs--including its investment
plans, budgets and tariffs--are subject to review by a supervisory board
chaired by the DGEP, and by the Ministery for Mines and Energy. PLN's
procurement activities are controlled by a Proci-rement Control Team in the
National Secretariat (SEKNEG) set up in 1980.
1.04      Since 1969, the Bank has played a significant role in the develop-
ment of power generation and distribution facilities in arid around Jakarta and
in West and Central Java, through four distribution projects (Credits 165-IND



-3-
and 334-IND and Loans 1259-IND and 2056-IND) and ten power generation projects
(Credit 399-IND and Loans 1127-IND, 1365-IND, L513-IND, 1708-IND, 1872-IND,
1950-IND, 2214-IND, 2300-IND and 2443-IND). Those loans and credits encour-
ajed some major institutional, organizational ani financial reforms in the
sector, including providing PLN with a new charter giving it substantial
autonomy. They also provided funds for consulting services notably the large
management consultancy effort, the Java System Development Study, and the EMV
System Study, among a host of other technical and institutional studies. Six
power projects have been completed so far and PLN's performance in
implementation has been uneven, with significant improvement in the fourth and
fifth projects, but with substantial delay in completion of the sixth project.
Source of Data for PCR
1.05      This PCR is based on:
(a) information available in Bank files;
(b) quarterly Progress and Financial reports submitted by the
consultant;
(c) project completio;x report furnished by the consultant;
(d) SARs for Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth,
Thirteenth and Fourteenth power projects;
(e) discussions with PLN personnel and field visit to Semarang power
station during the Bank mission to Indonesia from July 2 to
16, 1985; and
(f) finatization of the cost data for the project during the Bank
mission to Indonesia from September 1 to September 30, 1986.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origin
2.01      The Bank has had a continuing participation in the power developnent
program of Indonesia since 1969, and the present project was the next logical
step in this development process. The Java System Development Study carried
out by PLN's consultant, had identified the addition of 2 x 200 MW units at
Muara Karang power station (Bank'.s sixth power project) followed by the
addition of 1 x 200 MW unit at the. existing 2 x 50 MW Semarang power station,
as the least cost sequence of development, to meet the demand by 1982/83.  At
the Bank's instance, the consultant reviewed the earlier studies, considering
a lower demand-growth scenario anti taking into account the formulation of the
all-Java EHV grid. It was concluded that a 200-MW unit at Semarang would be
well -laced to meet load growth in central Java until 1983. From 1984 onwards
it was expected that the ERV lines would facilitate pooling of units between
west Java (where large coal-fired units would come into operation) and central



- 4 -
Javc. The Bank, accordingly, was not in favor of constructing at that ste'ge 2
x 200 MW units at Semarang as proposed by PLN, which anticipated slippages in
the commissioning of Suralaya thermal station in west Java. Both
materialization of the system demand as well as commissioning of generating
capacity were delayed by about 18 months from the original forecast. The
installed capacity to peak-demand ratio for Java in 1982/83 was 1.41 as
forecast and 1.56 as actually obtained.
Preparation and Apgraisal
2.02      The project was conceived in late 1976 and was prepared by PLN in
about one year's time with the assistance of Bank missions and the consultants
who were working on Semarang units 1 and 2 and who were appointed as
consultants in May 1977. The Semarang site did not have adequate space for
coal storage, hence the unit was designed for oil firing with provision for
future gas firing. It was also decided to go in for a reheat-type unit for
the first time to rtalize higher efficiency. SemArang site facilities were
planned to be developed for the addition of a fourth and final 250-MW oil/gas
fired unit in the future, bringing the total station capacity to 550 MW. The
feasibility study having been completed for the coal-fired thermal station at
Suralaya in West Java (under Loan 1127-IND), it was decided to provide some
funds for detailed engineering of Suralaya in the project to meet the target
commissioning date of 1984. Likewise, it was decided to incorporate
feasibility studies for the next coal-fired station in east Java, thus
preparing the stage for an all-Java power grid linked by the EHV system, for
which engineering and design were already in progress.
Pro]ect Objectives
2.03      The main objectives of the project at appraisal were to augment
PLN's system capabilfty to meet the rapidly growing demand, to strengthen the
150-kV transmission aetwork and substation facilities for utilizing the
additional 200-MW power output from Semarang, and to initiate action for the
next stage of generation development by financing detailed engineering for the
Suralaya thermal station in west Java and a feasibility study for a coal-fired
station in east Java. The introduction for the first time (following the
earlier financial recovery plan) of specific financial covenants relating to
self-financing, debt service and debt/equity ratios, was a major objective
aimed at strengthening the institution. During the course of project
execi-tion, additional studies having technical and institution-building
objectives, were added to the project scope and financed by the Bark (tee
para. 2.06).
Project Description
2.04      The project as appraised comprised the following components:
(a)  construction of the third 200-MW oil-fired thermal power unit at the
Semarang Harbor power station;
(b)  construction of 121 km of 150-kV transmission lines connecting the
Semarang Harbor power sLation to Ungaranj, West Sema-ang and Kudus;



-5-
(c) construction of two new 150-kV substations at Ungaran and Kudus and
extension of the existing Semarang Harbor, West Semarang, Jatingaleh
and Solo substations with a total tranformer capacity of 150 HVA;
(d) consultants' services for engineering and procurement of major
equipment for a new, dual- (coal-/oil-) fired thermal power station
in west Java (Suralaya); and
(e) consultants' services for the preparation of a feasibility study and
site investigations for a new dual- (coal-/oil-) fired thermal power
plant site in east Java.

Subsequent Additions
2.06      During the course of project implementation it was realized that
there would be considerable savings in the loan due to much lower than
anticipated equipment prices. On request from GOI/PLN, the Bank agreed to
incorporate financing of the following items from the loan proceeds.
(a) Addition of 57 km of 150-kV second circuit from Jolok through
Salatiga and Boyolali to Solo Barat substation on existing double
circuit towers. The need for this circuit was established by load
flow studies, carried out by consultants in 1979/80;
Estimated total cost US$0.70 million
(b) Addition of 150-kV switching bays at Jolok, Salatiga, Boyolali and
Solo Barat substations to control the second 150-kV circuit;
Estimated total cost US$0.91 million
(c) Feasibility study of Sunda Strait (between Java and Sumatera) to
establish whether a submarine cable could be laid for transporting
power from mine-mouth coal fired stations in Sumatera to the load
center in Java;
Estimated total cost US$0.97 million
- Rp 100 million
(d) Preparation of a management information system for the power sector
(subsequently limited to the DGEP)
Estimated total cost US$1.05 million
+ Rp 2.0 billion
III. IMPL!MENTATION
Implementation Arrangements
3.01      In the absence of an organization in PLN for designing thermal
stations (which situation prevails today, although plans are presently afoot
for creating an engineering services center) it was decided at the time of
appraisal to entrust--design, preparation of bid documents, assistance to PLN
in bid evaluation and contract award and construction supervision of Semarang
thermal station--to a consultant. The Thermal Projects division of PLN
provided a construction supervision team, under a project manager, to assist
the consultant's staff. Evaluation of bids was accomplished at PLN'e head
office with the consultant's assistance. With regard to the transmission line
and substation component, it was decided that PLN should play a major role in
design procurement and installation, for the first time, with limited
assistance from the consultants. PLY already had an organization for
supervising transmission line and substation works.
3.02      The consultants, already engaged on Semarang units 1 and 2, were
appointed directly by PLN as consultants for Semarang unit 3 and for the 150-
kV transmission lines and substations. Other consultants were selecte4 for



- 8 -
the East Java thermal station feasibility study, the Sunda Sea Bed feasibility
study, the Management Information System study and the engineering and
procuremernt phase of the Suralaya project, all after obtaining consultancy
proposals from short listed firms.
Implementation Schedule
3.03      Delays in Contract Awards.  An analysis of the scheduled and actual
dates of contract award and contract implementation for major project compo-
nents is presented in Annex 1. There were delays of about two months only in
signing of most of the contracts except for a delay of four months in the
contract for site development and six months in the contract for piling. The
time interval between tender invitation and contract signing was of the order
of 12 months for some of the major contracts. Signing of the piling contract
was delayed due to introduction of a Presidential Decree requiring observance
of stringent procurement procedures.
3.04      Major Problems and Delays in Construction.  The project was beset
with several problems during the conscruction phase which resulted in lengthy
implementation delays. The major problem areas are highlighted below:
(a) Site Development and Piling (10 months' delay)
Site development work (mainly covering oil and vater tanks) was
delayed by about 7 months, but being independent of other works, did not
contribute to project delay. A total delay of 17 months in completion of
the piling works, contributed to an overall project delay of about 10
months as many of the key areas piled could be released progressively for
further construction work. Of the total delay of ten months, three and
one-half months' delay was due to late signing of piling contract, two
months' delay due to poor workmanship in sections of the circulating
water tunnel necessitating breaking of concrete and recasting of some
tunnel sections, three months' delay due to tardy work and inefficiency
of the contractor, one month's delay due to necessity to cast boiler
foundation beams prior to boiler erection due to settlement of piles and
about one-half month's delay due to the necessity to predrill the soil
before pile driving in many instances, as direct drivinL of piles caused
movement of adjacent civil works. The circulating water intake tunnel
work encountered problems of heaving of trench bottom, toeing in of sheet
piles and lateral movement of piles. Pile driving for the steam
generator caused cracks to appear on the circulating water intake line,
due to soil movement. As a result, subsequent piling operations near
completed works, necessitated predrilling of soil with special equipment,
as the problem could not be solved by using low displacement pipe piles.
(b) Civil Construction (5 1/2 months delay)
This contract was beset with several problems such as shortage of
cement, lack of coordination in material procurement, delays in final-
izing coffer-dam design and difficulties in its construction, misfabri-
cation of steel by the subcontractor, and need for repairs at the site
leading to severe construction delays. It must be mentioned here that



- 9 -
fabricated steel supply was entrusted to this contractor after termin-
ating the contract of the original contractor for this item, owing to the
latter's poor performance. All this contributed to an additional delay
of about five and one-half months towards project completion.
(c) Other Contracts
All activities which followed the completion of the piling and civil
construction works suffered from the delays of the latter and ultimately
resulted in an overall delay of about 17 months in the co=zissioning of
the unit. This delay refers to the revised commissioning date of
April 1982 which was established subsequent to appraisal, although
according to the SAR's schedule (March 1983) the delay was only six
months, The performance of all contractors was generally satisfactory.
3.05      Transmission Lines and Substations.  In order to enable many small
contractors to gain experience, PLN awarded the transmission line foundation
contracts to 14 contractors. This strategy worked well, except in a very few
cases; foundation work was completed more or less on schedule. Erection of
towers was entrusted to four contractors and work was completed in June 1983,
about three months behind schedule. Line stringing contracts were awarded to
four contractors and were completed with minor delays which did not affect the
project schedule. The main problem encountered in substation work was
shortage of funds with PLN, which necessitated rescheduling of completion
dates. The performance of the substation equipment supply contractor was not
satisfactory with regard to meeting delivery schedules and timely supply of
design information. Construction of the eight substations was accomplished
through a number of contractors, and the substations with the associated lines
were progressively commissioned between July and October 1983. Although the
overall transmission and substation component of the project suffered a delay
of about one year, its completion synchronized with the commissioning of the
generating unit in September 1983.
Project Costs
3.06      The estimated and actual costs of the original project components
are detailed in Annex 2 and a summary of comparison with the SAR estimates is

There was an underrun of almost 40% in the cost of the Semarang main plant
equipment although estimates were based on the tenders for Muara Karang power
station. The higher cost of engineering and contruction supervision was due
to later addition of operation training of PLN personnel and retaining one of
the consultant's engineer, after project completion, for developing
maintenance information systems. The underrun of about 39% in the cost of
transmission lines and substations was partly due to devaluation of the rupiah
vis-a-vis the dollar, partly due to strong dollar in international markets and
partly due to lower-than-anticipated equipment prices. The overall project
showed an underrun of about 30X.

/a   US$15.0 million was cancelled from the loan amount on December 10, 1980.
3.08      The delayed disbursements are due to procurement and implementation
delays and cost savings.
Performance of Consultants
3.09      The performance of the consultants  on the Semarang unit 4 and
associated transmission lines and substations was satisfactory. The perform-
ance of consultants on the various engineering studies was also satisfactory.
Reporting
3.10      PLN and the consultant submitted a total of 19 physical progress and
financial reports. The format of the reports was useful in monitoring
progress of the project. The consultant also submitted a detailed completion
report, which, though not following Bank guidelines, contained a detailed
documentation of the project activities.
Procurement
3.11      Procurement for Semarang termal power station was accomplished
through a total of about 10 contract packages only. Site development and
piling were local contracts paid for entirely in Indonesian rupiahs. The
civil construction and mechanical and electrical contracts were supply-and-
erect contracts and involved both foreign and local cost components. A 7.5%
price preference was permitted in the loan agreement f,r local construction
contractors. The civil construction contract was won oy a local firm after
having recourse to the price preference. The mechanical and electrical
contract was won by a Japanese firm which was the lowest evaluated responsive
bidder, as the lowest price bid from an Indian firm was ruled out on the basis
of lack of experience. The case was strongly contested by the lowest bidder,



- 12 -
but the Bank maintained its acceptance of the recommendation made by the
consultant and PLN. The boiler contract was awarded to a Japanese trading
company for a boiler from a Japanese firm whose equipment had the backing of
expertise from a boiler manufacturer in the US. This award was strongly
contested by Japanese and American boiler manufacturers on grounds of
eligibility, but the Bank maintained its acceptance on the basis of the
successful consortium accepting responsibility jointly and severally. Except
for control and instrumentation, which was entrusted to a US firm, all other
equipment supply contracts were won by Japanese firms. The contract for
structural steel, which was awarded to a local firm (based on price
preference), had to be terminated due to poor performance, and the work was
entrusted to the local contractor for civil construction.
3.12      Transmission line and substation equipments were procured from
foreign sources through three contracts (one each for structures, conductors
and accessories and insulators) for the transmission lines and one contract
for substation equipment. Due to subsequent addition of a 150-kV line section
and the refusal of the selected bidder to accept the original rates for the
increased quantity of conductors (due to sharp increase in aluminum prices)
PLN proposed and the Bank accepted reinvitation of tenders from the next four
lowest bidders. Tower deliveries were delayed due to failure of two types of
towers during testing but this did not upset project schedule. Problems were
encountered in deliveries of substation equipments due to improper shipment
and tardy submission of information by the vendor.
3.13      There were no major problems in procurement, apart from delays in
evaluation and award of contracts.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Semarang Thermal Station
4.01      The operating performance of Semarang unit 3 as briefly narrated
here is based on discussions with PLN engineers during site visits in
July 1985 and September 1986.
Operating Efficiency
4.02      The average gross heat rate of the unit for the year 1984/85 was
0.244 1/kwh corresponding to a gross efficiency of about 35.0%. On a perform-
ance test at 100% load the efficiency would be higher, although such a figure
is not available. Compared to this, performance figures for the 50-MW units
at Semarang for 1984/85 were a gross consumption of about 0.293 1/kwh and an
efficiency of about 29%.
Operating Problems
4.03      There have been no major operating problems with this unit.  Some
minor operating problems are: (a) choking of flue gas analyzer sample tube by
deposits due to high (3.5%) sulfur content in the fuel oil; (b) sluggish



- 13 -
response of drum level control due to steam entry into the instrument;
(c) difficulty in controlling the unit below 50% load; (d) breakage of fiber-
glass piping for steahl and air flow indicators; and (e) breakage of outdoor
switchyard disconnect switch contacts. Though minor, these problems needed to
be rectified.
4.04      The unit has been in service for about 3 years; it had a forced
outage factor of only 2.1% and a planned outage factor of 20.5% in 1984/85.
These figures are considered to be within acceptable range for good operating
practice.
Engineering, Design, Operation and Maintenance
4.05      The engineering and design of the plant are generally satisfactory
exept that not enough space has been provided in the circulating water pump
house for major overhauls on pump units. Further, there is a fairly major
problem of soil subsidence (due to inadequate cotIsolidation of fill and
original layer of alluvial soil), which results in cracking of the groundworks
such as slabs, trenches, etc., and leakage of pipes. Very little can be done,
except patchwork repairs, to mitigate this problem. Although the plant is
generally well maintained, there are certain aspects which need to be looked
into: (a) repairs to sea water booster pump of the desalination plant which
has been out of service for almost two years; (b) replacement of disconnect
switch contacts; (c) leakage of stop logs; and (d) nonavailability of internal
wiring drawings from the consultant. The operators have been well trained
during the construction phase, under the consultancy contract, in Indonesia
and abroad. Simulator training was given to key personnel in the works of the
turbine generator supplier in Japan and on steam generator operation at Taiwan
Power in Taiwan. However, as in rest of PLN, there is a shortage of trained
maintenance personnel and difficulty in understanding manuals in English by
maintenance personnel. An engineer from a consultant was engaged to provide
and train staff in the use of a computerized management information system for
preventive maintenance. Presently no maintenance work is given out on
contract; supervisors from equipment suppliers are, however, engaged during
major overhauls. A major unit overhaul takes about 60 days and there are
proposals for cutting this period to 45 days. The station employs a total of
348 persons (175 operation/maintenance), which is somewhat on the high side.
Environmental Aspects
4.06      The Semarang power plant was designed using the standards set by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the US as criteria. Environmental
measurements were made by PLN's research department in 1983 and yielded the
following results. The maximum values obtained during measurements were:



- 14 -
Cooling Water
Temperature differential °c                                7
Alkaline level (pH)                                        8.7
Dissolved oxygen (ppm)                                     8.7
Turbidity (NTV)                                            4.8
Suspended solids (g/liter)                                15
Free chlorine (ppm)                                        0.055
Oil (ppm)                                                  2.7
Air
Sulfur dioxide (ppb)                                       0.489
Oxides of nitrogen (NOx)  (ppm)                            0.02
Flue Gas
Carbon monoxide (CO)  (Z vol)                              0
Oxygen (02)  (% vol)                                       3.37
Carbon dioxide (CO2)  (2 vol)                             14.3
Nitrogen (Na)                                             84.0
Oxides of nitroen (NO.)                                    0
Absence of NO in flue gas leads to the conclusion that the source is
elsewhere.  TKe concentration of CO2 is within permissible limits.
4.07      The stack-monitoring systems and the mobile atmosphere-pollution
measuring stations, procured under the Sixth power project, were received in
1984/85 and have been recently put into operation. The effluent treatment
plant is not in operation. On-line monitoring of cooling water temperature is
not done, and waste effluent water is not monitored. Periodic monitoring of
air and effluent water at the station needs to be undertaken, and periodic
monitoring of atmospheric pollution should be carried out.
Transmission Lines and Substations
4.08      There were no significant problems in the operation of the
tranmission lines and substations.
Engineering Studies
4.09      West Java Thermal Power Project.  This study was satisfactorily
completed and the same consultant was subsequently appointed for implementa-
tion of the Suralaya thermal power station project.
4.10      East Java Thermal Power Station.  This study was successfully
completed and resulted in the selection of Paiton as the site for the next
thermal power station. An independent consultant was appointed by the Bank to
review the findings of the study particularly in regard to the soil
investigations and civil engineering aspects of the study. Several useful
suggestions made by him were given due consideration.
4.11      Sunda Sea Bed Study.  This study was satisfactorily completed.  It
established that it would be technically feasible to lay submarine cables on
the Sunda sea bed; however it was found more economical to transport coal from



- 15 -
Sumatera to a thermal stations in West Java, than to construct a mine mouth
thermal station in Sumatera and transmit power to Java. This was mainly due
to the very high cost of transmission, mainly associated with the submarine
cables.
4.12      Management Information Study for DGEP.  The study culminated in
several volu'ies of report and DGEP subsequently appointed a local consultant
for implementing some of the recommendations. Until the time of this report
no significant progress was made in implementation due to several reasons, the
most important of which were that the recommendations were more of an academic
nature and required a large staff to implement.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Financial Objectives
5.01      Earlier Bank projects in the power sector had laid stress on the
Financial Recovery Plan (FRP). The objective of the FRP for PLN to achieve a
full revenue/cost recovery was met in 1975/76, three years ahead of schedule.
5.02      In view of PLN having met well in advance the targets set for finan-
cial recovery, ccnventional financial performance targets were substituted for
the FRP, under this project. A self-financing ratio (SFR) covenant was
adopted because of the desirability of financing, out of internal cash
generation, a reasonable proportion of PLN's investment program. The agreed
SF  was 30% by 1985/86, with indicative targets for the intervening years.
Performance Results
5.03      PLN was able to maintain a position slightly above breakeven in
terms of operating income during the year 1976/77 through 1978/79.
5.04      The quantification of SFR indicative targets had been revised in
1979 under the Eighth Power Project (Loan 1708-IND), and subsequently in 1982
under the Twelfth Power Project (Loan 2214-IND), to take into account signifi-
cant changes in PLN'9 capital expenditures and fuel costs. The SFR target for
1985/86 and onwards was reduced from 30% to 20X under the Twelfth Power
Project. A mechanism was introduced at the same time to adjust the minimum
indicative targets inversely with any significant changes in PLN's capital
expenditures and fuel costs. PLN's financial performance in terms of cash
generation is shown in Table 5.1.

/a   The percentage of PLN's capital expenditures for the target year plus the two preceding
years covered by its net revenue plus depreciation retentions less debt service for the
same three years.
5.05      PLN was able to meet the revised minimum SFR targets.  The total
capital expenditure over the period 1977/78 to 1984/85 was Rp 4,244 billion
compared to appraisal projection of Rp 4,537 billion and corresponding values
of internal cash generation were Rp 937 billion (actual) versus Rp 1,319
billion (appraisal).
5.06      Actual operating revenues increased, over the period 1977/78 through
1984/85, at 41X p.a., as against the projected 352 p.a.  As regards PLN's
sales in GWh, the actual results were close to the projected sales until
1982/83. In 1983/84 and 1984/85, the actual sales were about 141 and 21Z
lower, respectively, than the projections for those years mainly due to
(a) delays in some consumers connection program due to budget constraints; and
(b) the economic recession in the last few years leading to lower consumption
from existing consumers. A comparison between the projected and actual
financial results is summarized in Annex 4. Delqiled comparative financial
statements are given in Annex 5, Tables 1 to 3._
Tariffs
5.07      Fuel price increases following 0o0's policy of removing domestic oil
subsidies significantly increased PLN's operating expenses.  The average fuel
price paid by PLN remained at abouLt Rp 25/liter until 1978/79 and increased by
about 30X in 1979/80, 40X in 1980/81, 201 in 1982/83 and about 601 p.a. in
1/   PLN's actual financial results as presented in this report are based on
its fixed assets which are revalued up to March 31, 1979 and on
subsequent fixed asset acquisitions which are appraised at cost. They do
not take into account the impact of Government Regulation No. 45/1986
dated October 2, 1986, which provides for the revaluation of assets of
business and public corporations as of January 1, 1987, for assets
acquired during the years 1970 to 1986.



- 17 -
1983/84 and 1984/85.  The fuel cost as a percentage of total operating
expenses rose from 27.7% in 1977/78 to 65.5% in 1984/85.
5.08      While fuel prices increased significantly, PLN's tariff remained
unchanged until 1980/81, when it was raised by about 50% as a condition of the
Bank's assistance in the financing of the Ninth Power Project (Loan 1872-IND,
1980). Tariff adjustments since 1980/81 have been intended merely to offset
the fuel cost increases and in addition lagged behind the fuel price adjust-
ments. Consequently, PLN's tariffs were not sufficient to cover the full
increases in its operating expenses, resulting in operating losses in 1979/80
and 1982/83.
5.09      In May 1974, PLN instituted a mechanism of tariff surcharges through
which adjustments of revenues were made possible. Repeated use of the sur-
charge mechanism introduced distortion into the tariff structure. The conse-
quential pricing anomalies were rectified in the tariff revision of May 1980,
which was based on the Long Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) pricing principles.
However, till 1983, all tariff increases were effected entirely through
changes only in the energy charges. The failure to adjust the demand charges
thus reintroduced distortions in the tariff structure.
5.10      In 1983, the Bank assisted PLN in its studies of costs and tariff
structure. Based on the results of these studies, PLN agreed to revise its
tariff structure to reflect better the LRMC of electricity supply. The Bank's
continued involvement in the Power sector and its support in tariff studies
has been an important contributing factor in motivating PLN towards economic
efficiency pricing. In January 1984 PLN introduced an increase of about 24%
in the demand as well as energy charges.
Financial Management
5.11      The necessity to build in adjustments to modify the SFR targets and
the fact that PLN was able to meet the SFR covenant while its operations had
been incurring losses indicated that the SPa type of measure with the covenan-
ted levels was less appropriate from the viewpoint of financial viability.
Under the Fourteenth Power Project (Loan 2443-IND, 1984), GOI/PLN agreed to a
rate of return (ROR) covenant of at least 8% from 1986/87 onwards, with a
minimum target of 6% in 1985/86. The SPR was retained as one of the
performance indicators to be monitored regularly to ensure PLN's self-
financing capability. thile PLN was able to meet the indicative SFR target
for 1984/85, unaudited financial results for 1985/86 and estimates for 1986/87
suggest that PLN will be unable to satisfy the requirements of the ROR
covenant adopted under Loan 2443-IND. The Government, PLN and the Bank have
recently concluded that an ROR covenant for PLN's operations as a whole is not
appropriate in view of the largely socially-oriented and fragmented nature of
PLN's operations outside Java which have been sustaining large operating
losses. Consequently, under the proposed next project for PLN (Power
Transmission and Distribution Project), separate financial performance targets
will be adopted for PLN's operations in Java and outside Java, and the
existing revenue covenant will be modified. Under the modified revenue
covenant, PLN will be required to achieve: (a) for its operations in Java, a
ROR of not less than 8% by no later than 1988/89 and to maintain it at or



- 18 -
above that level for fiscal years thereafter, and (b) for its operations
outside Java, a break-even situation by no later than 1990/91.
5.12      Under the Fifth Power Project (Loan 1259-IND), two covenants were
introduced to ensure PLN's prudent debt management: (a) minimum future debt
service coverage of 1.0; and (b) settlement of all its debts within one month
when due. These covenants (which also applied for the Sixth Power Project,
Loan 1365-IND) were replaced under the Seventh Power Project (Loan 1513-IND)
by: (i) minimum future debt service coverage of 1.3 times; and (ii) a
debt/equity ratio of 60/to. The Thirteenth Power Project (Loan 2300-IND,
1983) adopted only one debt management covenant which required a minimum of
1.5 times coverage of future debt service each year out of the forecast
internal funds for that year; this requirement replaced all earlier debt
limitation covenants. This change reflected the growth of a company like PLN,
and at the same time, made allowance for the added future earning power. PLN
has been complying with this covenant.
5.13      PLN's collection performance has been generally satisfactory.  The
accounts receivable position of customers other than government users has been
improved to under two months of billing. PLN's sales to government users
account for about 102 of its total sales; but collections from some government
users (including Army users and local governments) have not been promptly
settled when due.
5.14      The Government has taken various measures to improve the payment
performance by government users. Outstanding government accounts receivable
were reduced from over one year in 1981/82 to about five months of billing in
1983/84. An action plan was agreed under the Fourteenth Power Project (Loan
2443-IND) to reduce the arrears further. It was also agreed under the
Fourteenth Power Project to modify the earlier covenant, which required each
government user to pay its bills promptly, to a covenant that required the
amounts owed by all government users in aggregate to be kept to less than two
months of total billings for such users. PLN is also required under the new
covenant to keep collection data for government users adequately disaggregated
so that the source of any overdue payment problems could be identified. As a
result of continued efforts by concerned ministries and PLN, the overdue
government accounts receivable have been reduced considerably over the last
two years and are currently equivalent to less than two months of annual
billings.
Auditing
5.15      PLN's accounts are required by its charter to be audited by
Government auditors. The audit reports are acceptable to the Bank, but are
subject to long delays. In 1983 special efforts were made by PLN's Accounting
Department to expedite the closing of accounts within six months after the
close of the fiscal year as stipulated in PLN's charter. This was a signifi-
cant improvement. Government audit would normally take two to three months.
To be more realistic and also in line with PLN's charter requirement and
Government's regulations, the Bank's audit submission covenant was amended
under the Fourteenth Power Project (Loan 2443-IND) from six to nine months
after the close of the fiscal year. PLN, however, is required to submit its



- 19 -
unaudited accounts to the Bank for early review and, as required of all public
corporations, to the Government for audit within six months of the end of the
fiscal year. These reporting requirements are being met.
VII. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.01      At the time of appraisal in 1977, PLN had begun to emerge and was
continuing to develop into a well-organized power utility. The present
project contributed to the further institutional development process, through
continuous review of financial  hrformance and organizational development as
also through several major techzical studies, which had built-in components
for truining and enhancement of expertise in specific areas. PLN's institu-
tional development and Bank's involvement in this process is briefly narrated
be_.ow.
Management
6.02      PLN's management systems have in general been well designed; however
there are still certain weaknesses, notably the division of responsibility
between the regions/construction divisions on the one hand and the central
departments on the other. The process of decentralization of responsibility
to the regions/construction departments is under consideration, but its
implementation will be gradual as improved and restructured information
systems are still being developed. A management audit was commissioned by PLN
in 1980/81 and was undertaken by a local firm working in association with
international management consultants. Their recommendations for establishment
of a more comprehensive corporate plannning process, improvement in coordi-
nation between the various headquarters departments and between headquarters
and the regions, adoption of common design standards and procurement meth-
odology and improvements in accounting, computing, inventory control and
personnel management were reviewed by an in-house committee and several
recommendations were implemented. The Bank has financed several management
studies: Project Management Advisory Services (under Loan 1708-IND)p Account-
ing, Budgeting and Management Information Systems (under Loan 2056-IND), and
Management Information Systems for PLN (under Loan 2214-IND). Sustained
efforts at implementation are expectea to considerably strengthen and stream-
line PLN's management capabilities.
Planning, Design and Research
6.03      PLN has acquired adequate expertise in generation, transmission and
distribution planning. Steps towards greater regional involvement in planning
were taken in 1981, and a series of management development courses have been
instituted for regional and branch managers. Several Bank-financed studies
have been devised for enhancing PLN's planning capabilities notably Power
Market Study (under Loan 1708-IND) and the Hydro Potential Studies under
Loan 1365-IND. Towards strengthening PLN's engineering and design capabil-
ities, in 1985, PLN established an Engineering Services Center as agreed under
Loan 2443-IND. The Bank proposas to support the development of this center
through consultancy assistance in the next operations. With all these
efforts, PLN's dependence on consultants is expected to continue to decrease
over the years.



- 20 -
Manpower and Training
6.04      PLN's staff increased from a Jevel of about 21,000 in 1976/77 to
about 51,000 in 1985/86. About 60% of the staff is in technical and 40% in
administrative cadres. In spite of efforts such as student scholarships and
i.centives of foreign technical training, PLN has always faced and continues
to face difficulties in recruiting university graduates as a result of the
nationwide shortage of such personnel, whose composition continues to remain
at an unsatisfactorily low level of less than 5% of total staff.
6.05      PLN's efforts at training and Bank's involvement in this field, have
been considerable. PLN has a separate function (Pusdiklat) for education and
training. Its staff of about 200 (including 48 trained instructors) trains
annually about 1,300 personnel in technical and financial disciplines. Five
training centers were built under earlier Bank loans. The Ninth Power Project
(Loan 1872-IND) provided for an advanced training school for thermal power
plant operators, including a facsimile digital training simulator which is now
functioning at Suralaya. The Ninth Power Project also provided for training
in the fields of systems protection, thermal station operation, maintenance
and design and in EHV practice, while the Tenth Power Project (Loan 1950-IND)
provided for on the job training in the country in selected fields like civil
works contract administration. The Twelfth Power Project (Loan 2214-IND)
includes a large training component of US$25.0 million to (a) reorganize and
enlarge the entire manpower development, training and personnel management
functions for middle and lower level staff, improving job performance
evaluation systems and introducing in-house management training; (b) start
five more training centers; and (c) develop and implement a training/develop-
ment program for PLN's senior staff. These steps are currently under
implementation.
Accounting and Budgeting
6.06      The present system of accounting, installed in the early 1970s,
though generally following normal utility practice, is in a need of redesign-
ing. Presently, severe delays take place in the finalization of accounts,
which are prepared in 120 brarch offices.  PLN's procedures for budget prepar-
ation and monitoring expenditures still need to be properly coordinated
between departments and between regional offices. PLN's management initiated
a detailed review of the procedures. Under the Eleventh Power Project (Loan
2056-IND) Bank funds were provi'ed for management consultancy in setting up an
appropriate accounting system, strengthening budgetary control procedures and
computerizing the accounts. This study is completed and implementation of its
recommendations is in progress. PLN has also engaged consultants to improve
asset evaluation, inventory control and project-cost accounting. A major
constraint to PLN's accounting has been a lack of trained senior
accountants. Steps are being taken to redress this situation through the
training program and transfer of personnel from the Ministry of Finance.

Procurement
6.07      Procurement of goods and services has a major influence on PLN's
overall performance in project implementation. Procedures introduced by GOI
since 1983 for external control of procurement of both consultants services
and of goods and services have reduced PLN's autonomy in procurement. These
procedures have also considerably lengthened the time required in the procure-
ment cycle, particularly in bid evaluation, approval of evaluation, contract
negotiations, etc. PLN is looking into this problem to find ways and means of
simplifying internal procedures to reduce delays. The organization of
procurement has been reviewed (inter alia) by consultants in the context of
the project management study under the Eighth Power Project (Loan 1708-IND).
The development of an Engineering Services Center (para. 6.03) is expected to
centralize procurement function for all major projects.
Overall Performance
6.08      PLN's overall performance from the time of appraisal in 1977/78 till
1985/86 has been impressive. Its sales increased annually by an average of
about 17%, and performance indicators such as the number of consumers per
employee increased from 59 to 116 (i.e., by 97%) and energy sold per employee
increased from 147 MWh to 248 MWh (i.e., by 69%).  Its ambitious customer-
connection programs were fulfilled year after year. Standards of reliability
of supply were improved. The rate of growth of uneconomic captive plants in
the country declined after 1977. Improvements in the speed of implementation
of projects have been eroded by slippages of over a year in construction of
major thermal projects like Muara Karang, Semarang and Suralaya. The main
problems have now shifted to complex procurement procedures and resource con-
straints. PLN's drive to reduce transmission and distribution losses, which
appeared to have run out of momentum in 1982/83, has recently been revived,
and an intensive loss-reduction effort has been initiated. Losses have
declined in 1984/85 and 1985/86.
VII. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
7.01      An economic reevaluation of the 200 MW unit for Semarang has been
done, essentially on the line of the SAR. The re-evaluation is based on
constant end 1981/1982 prices. The main points which highlight the differ-
ences between the data and assumptions used in the SAR and those used in the
re-evaluation are summarized below.
Plant Capacity Factor
7.02      The SAR assumed a capacity factor of about 68% for the first 10
years, reducing to about 55% for the next 4 years and about 30% towards the
end of the plant life of 30 years. The PCR uses actual gross generation
values for 1983/84 to 1985/86 and declining values with capacity factor of 551
from 1986/87 to about 30% in 2008/09 as shown in Annex 6, assuming a plant
economic life of 25 years. The reduction in capacity factors reflect shift
from oil to coal burning power stations for base load duties.



- 22 -
Fuel Price
7.03      The economic evaluation at project appraisal was based on a fuel
price of US$11.6 per barrel of Bunker C oil (US cents 7.3/liter or
Rp 30.3/liter in 1977 prices); the equivalent energy cost being Rp 9.4/kWh
generated. Prior to 1984/85, the fuel-oil prices to PLN were subsidized. In
1984/85 the fuel-oil price for PLN was slightly above the international
price. The PCR uses the prevailing domestic fuel prices for the years 1983/84
thru 1985/86, the last being Rp 220 per liter, equivalent to about US$35.0 per
barrel, actual gross fuel efficiency of 0.24 1/kWh, amounting to an energy
cost of Rp 50.6/kWh in 1984/85 and Rp 52.6 per kWh in 1985/86 in current
prices. Fuel prices from 1986/87 onwards are used at the border price of
about $15 per barrel or Rp 150 per liter.
Operation and Maintenance Cost
7.04      The SAR had assumed an operation and maintenance cost of 21 of the
capital cost for Semarang and the associated transmission and distribution.
The PCR uses actual O&M costs for Semarang and Central Java operations for
1983/84 through 1985/86 and the 1985/86 value throughout the remainder of the
plant life. O&M and administration costs are based on actual costs furnished
by PLN per kWh of electricity sales in Central Java area where Semarang is
located. These costs are much higher than the SAR value of 2% of the capital
costs, partly because they are average costs rather than incremental costs.
Benefits
7.05      The SAR evaluated the benefits on the basis of average sale price of
fp 30.5 per kWh in 1977 prices. The PCR evaluates the benefits based on
actual average revenues per kWh for 1983/84 through 1985/86 and the 1985/86
value for the rest of the plant life. This is a pessimistic assumption since
tariff revision of about 25% is expected in 1988.
EIRR Computation
7.06      Details of the economic reevaluation are presented in Annex 6,
Tables 1, 2, 3. The IERR (internal economic rate of return) works out to
about 11%. This is below the SAR figure of 19X, mainly because of much higher
O&M costs, lower-than-desirable level of tariff and lower expected capacity
factor for the oil-fired unit than were assumed at the time of the appraisal.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
Achievement of Project 0Ojectives
8.01      Construction of the 200-MW unit at Semarang was a timely augmenta-
tion of the generation capability of PLI, as borne out by the sustained load
growth at an average annual rate of about 19%.



- 23 -
8.02      The 200-MW unit has been operating at about 691 capacity, which is
very close to the value of 68X assumed in the SAR. With a shift away from
oil-fired generation to coal, the capacity factor for Semarang has been
reduced and will be progressively reduced further. The Semarang unit achieves
an internal economic rate of return of only about 111, with benefit evaluation
based on prevailing tariff levels. This is substantially lower than the SAR
value of 191, for reasons explained in para. 7.06.
8.03      The technical studies associated with the project have served as
useful preparatory ground for future bank operations in the power sector. The
recommendations of the Management Information study for DCEP have, however,
not been fully implemented.
Project Implementation and Operating Outcome
8.04      Implementation of the project was achieved with an inordinate delay
of 17 months in commissioning of Semarang and of about 11 months in commis-
sioning of the 150-kV transmission lines and substations. These delays refer
to target commissioning dates, which were subsequently set and which were
about 11 months earlier than SAR assumptions. The delays were due to a
combination of factors, the most important of which were (a) delay in signing
of piling contract, (b) problems in piling work coupled with tardy performance
of the piling contractor, (c) tardy performance of the civil works contractors
and (d) rupiah finance constraints for substations and tranmission lines.
8.05      The power plant has been operating satisfactorily and has achieved
guaranteed figures of performance. The outage record of the unit has been
good.
8.06      PLN accomplished for the first time engineering and design of the
substations (and to a substantial extent the transmission lines) with minimum
assistance from the consultant. PLY continued to maks progress in institu-
tional development, the financial performance was uneven over the tenure of
the project. While a lot has been done in these fields, much remains to be
done, and PLN is making serious efforts towards maintaining the momentum of
progress.
Performance of External Agencies
8.07      The Bank not only continued but also intensified its involvement in
the growth of PLY and in the development of the power sector. PLN extended
excellent cooperation to Bank missions and appreciated the Bank's role in its
development.

Uote:  The revaluation index is based on price deflators 1tsed by PLN for
revaluation of their assets (the 1985/86 figure is an assumed value).
The expenditures are total expenditures on foreign and local components
(the foreign cost being converted to local costs by using the exchange
rate prevailing in the particular year) and are exclusive of duties and
taxes and interest during construction. The Standard Conversion Factor
(SCF) for local cost components is assumed as 1.O, although the SAR had
assumed an SCF of 0.87.
