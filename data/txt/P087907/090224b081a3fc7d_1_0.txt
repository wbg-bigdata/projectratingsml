                         The revised objective of the project is to improve conditions of learning of students in primary and scondary schools in Iraq through the construction of new schools,
                         the extension of existing schools, and the rehabilitation of schools in need of urgent repair.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Ministry of Education (MOE) has continued its commitment and has broadly fulfilled the actions agreed during the October 2012 mission. This is evident in the sustained
                         momentum over the past year and a half. At this point of the project, it is critical to maintain a close oversight of the project's activities, including the capacity of the Project
                         Management Team (PMT) to ensure successful implementation and satisfactory closing. Special attention is required to resolve the issues associated with the remaining 11 six-
                         classroom blocks to ensure successful completion of project activities and fulfillment of its objectives.

                         A reallocation of proceeds was approved by the Bank on December 6, 2012; this has allowed the Project to make use of the savings in training and operational costs.

                         Construction of 50 new schools: This includes 32 primary and 18 secondary schools (which are all 12-classroom schools). The number of new schools increased by 1 between
                         October 2012 and February 2013, in line with the expected achievement in the October 2012 Action Plan. Of the 50 planned new schools, 45 have now been completed, with 39

                         operational, benefiting approximately 22,000 children. The PMT has successfully terminated a contract due to less than satisfactory performance(with 3 schools) and the new
                         contractors have started construction for the remaining works for these 3 schools. The average physical progress for the remaining 5 schools has increased from 71 percent (in
                         October 2012) to 79 percent (in February 2013).

                         Six-classroom blocks (and toilette extensions) at 21 schools: The project added this sub-component when it was restructured in September 2010. There are now 10 completed six-
                         classroom blocks (out of the 21), one more than the target set in the May 2012 Action Plan. Yet, there has been slow implementation progress for the remaining 11 six- classroom
                         blocks (and toilet extensions) due to a contractor (with who is building 9 of the 21 six-classroom blocks) who has an ongoing legal issue with the Ministry of Higher Education and
                         Scientific Research (MOHESR). Physical progress for the remaining 11 planned six-classroom blocks has improved from 46 percent in October 2012 to 60 percent in February 2013
