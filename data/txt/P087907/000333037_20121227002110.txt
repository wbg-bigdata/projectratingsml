2.       The Ministry of Education/Project Management Unit (MOE/PMT) has continued its
commitment and has largely fulfilled the actions agreed during the May 2012 mission. This is
evident in the sustained momentum over the past year since the October 2011 mission. To date,
disbursements have reached US$48.24 million, with total net commitments at US$10.25 million,
and uncommitted funds at US$1.51 million. Out of the 50 schools planned, 44 have been
completed. May 2012 targets were met as follows: 7 additional schools and 10 six-classroom
blocks have been completed (one more than the target set in May 2012 Action Plan). The average
physical progress for the remaining 6 schools is 71 percent. Physical progress for the remaining
11 planned six-classroom blocks is 46 percent. Over this period, the PMT continued to exert
efforts to address issues at construction sites, undertaking regular communication with contractors
and directorates of education (DOEs), frequent field visits and direct supervision of sites.
Training in financial management was delivered in June 2012 and training in contract and
construction management was delivered in September 2012. The training plan was updated
during the October 2012 mission to include contract and construction management training and
monitoring and evaluation training as per the following table:

        3.       The proposed reallocation is necessary to make use of the cost savings made under the
        “Works? expenditure category to finance training (Table 1) and to cover operational expenses
        arising from the closing date extension of one year, from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013.
        Previously, the training was funded through two expenditure categories: “Consultants’ Services?
        to finance the cost of the training service providers, and “Training? to finance all costs related to
        the participants. To better account for funds allocated to training activities, it was agreed to
        reallocate relevant funds from the “Consultants’ Services? category to the “Training? category;
        this would fund all training related costs, including costs of trainers, training material, training
        venue, participants’ travel, accommodations and per diem, as well as the cost of printing and
        translation as follows:

              Category (1): Reallocate US$600,000 to Category (4) and (5).

              Category (2): No change.

              Category (3) Reallocate US$489,000 to Category (4) and (5).

              Category (4) US$839,000 through adding US$600,000 from Category (1), and US$239,000
               from Category (3).

              Category (5) US$250,000 through adding same from Category (3).

              Category (4) will finance all training related costs; whereby expenditures, inter alia, per diem,
               travel, and visas will not be included in the Procurement Plan.




                                                              5
4.     It was also agreed to historically adjust training-related disbursements made against the
“Consultants’ Services? category to be disbursed against the “Training? category as follows:

remaining works is signed.
3/ For numbers to add up to the values included in other parts of this document, an amount of US$1.85 in
the DA should be added.
