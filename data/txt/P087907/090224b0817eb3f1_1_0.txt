                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Ministry of Education (MOE) Project Management Team (PMT) has continued its commitment and has largely fulfilled the actions agreed during the May 2012 mission. This is
                         evident in the sustained momentum over the past year since the October 2011 mission. At this point of the project, it is critical to maintain the PMT capacity at an adequate level of
                         staffing to ensure successful implementation and satisfactory closing.

                         To date, disbursement has reached US$ 48.24 million, with total net commitments (unpaid amounts) of US$10.25 million.

                         Construction of 50 new schools: This includes 32 primary and 18 secondary schools (which are all 12-classroom schools). The number of new schools increased by 7 between May
                         and October, 2012, in line with the expected achievement in the May 2012 Action Plan. Of the 50 planned new schools, 44 have now been completed, with 37 operational, benefiting
                         approximately 20,000 children. The average physical progress for the remaining 6 schools is 71 percent.

                         Six-classroom extensions at 21 schools: The project added this sub-component when it was restructured in September 2010. There are now 10 completed six-classroom blocks,
                         one more than the target set in May 2012 Action Plan. Physical progress for the remaining 11 planned six-classroom blocks is 46 percent.
