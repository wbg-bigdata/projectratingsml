                         The revised objective of the project is to improve conditions of learning of students in primary and scondary schools in Iraq through the construction of new schools,
                         the extension of existing schools, and the rehabilitation of schools in need of urgent repair.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Ministry of Education (MOE) has continued its commitment and has broadly fulfilled the actions agreed during the March 2013 mission. This is evident in the sustained
                         momentum since October 2011.

                         Rehabilitation of 133 existing schools. This sub-component was completed by the end of 2006. It included a range of interventions (such as the addition of new classrooms,
                         upgrading of electrical and plumbing systems, painting, roof repairs and new toilets) that benefited more than 82,000, which is well above the initial target of 44,848 students.

                         Construction of 50 new schools (target was revised to 48 new schools as part of project restructuring): This includes 32 primary and 18 secondary schools (which are all 12-
                         classroom schools). The number of completed new schools increased by 3 between March 2013 and May 2013. Of the 50 planned new schools, 48 have now been completed, with
                         42 operational, benefiting approximately 27,000 children. This is well above the target figure of 23,040 students.

                         Six-classroom blocks (and toilet extensions) at 21 schools: The project added this sub-component when it was restructured in September 2010. The number of completed six-
                         classroom blocks (out of the 21 planned) remains at 10. The slow implementation progress for the remaining 11 six- classroom blocks (and toilet extensions) has notably picked up
                         following the resolution of a legal issue with the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MOHESR) involving a contractor (who is building 9 of the 21 six-classroom
                         blocks). It is envisaged that the Project will be able to meet its end of project targets by end of June 2013; as 10 blocks stand at 70 - 90 percent, and one six-classroom block at 65
                         percent.

                         activities and fulfillment of its objectives by June 2013. In particular, efforts should be made to ensure that the remaining unfinished schools affected by the security conditions and
                         recent floods in the southern areas, be completed to the maximum extent possible.

                         There is a mission scheduled for June 16 - 20 where an in-depth discussion is planned to: (i) discuss the time line for the government and the Bank’s Implementation Completion
                         Report; and (ii) identify key lessons learned from the Project that could be reflected in the ministry's activities, as well as how best to disseminate the project achievements and
                         lessons learned.
