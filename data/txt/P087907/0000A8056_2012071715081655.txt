                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Ministry of Education's request to extend the ESCRP closing date to June 30, 2013 was approved in June 2012. The PMT is strongly encouraged to increase the momentum to
                         ensure complete and satisfactory fulfillment of project objectives. An Action Plan has been agreed to further accelerate progress, in order to make up for the cumulative delays over
                         the past years. Progress will be re-assessed during the forthcoming mission planned for October 2012.
