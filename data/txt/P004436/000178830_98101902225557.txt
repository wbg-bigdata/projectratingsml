REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION OF THE
PHILIPPINES TO BE GUARANTEED BY THE REPUBLIC
OF THE PHILIPPINES FOR A SIXTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the National Power Corporation for the equivalent of $61.0 million
with the guarantee of the Republic of the Philippines. The loan would be
for a term of 25 years including a four-year grace period at 7-1/4% per
annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent Economic Report - "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of the Philippines" (No. 78-PH of April 20, 1973) was circulated
to the Executive Directors on May 2, 1973 (R73-85). An economic mission
visited the Philippines in April and its preliminary conclusions are
incorporated below. The full report of the mission will be distributed to
the Executive Directors in due course. Annex I contains country data.
Recent Developments
3.        Since 1972, the Government has re-formulated its development
strategy by introducing a number of important and potentially far-reaching
economic and social reforms through decrees in such areas as agrarian reform,
taxation, customs administration and tariffs, banking and government organi-
zation. These reforms provide an opportunity to improve the performance of
the Philippine economy. Aided by the recent commodity boom in the inter-
national markets, economic activity in the Philippines has increased consid-
erably. The growth in real GNP, which had been about 5% a year for more
than a decade, is estimated to have doubled and reached 10% in 1973. However
underemployment and unemployment remain quite high, and in common with most
other countries the rate of inflation has increased appreciably in the past
year. These problems and the long-term implications of the energy crisis
for domestic production, the balance of payments, costs and employment are
now being examined by the economic mission.
4.        The strong recovery of the economy in 1973 resulted from increased
agricultural production, a recovery in the industrial sector including
manufactured exports, a boom in export incomes and an expansion in public
and private investment. The agricultural sector, which had suffered from
adverse weather conditions during the previous three years grew by 11% in
1973. Rice production in the present crop year is estimated to have increased
by 30% over the level of the previous year when floods reduced production
levels. This increase has been mainly due to favorable weather conditions,
increased use of fertilizers, more supervised credit and increased investments
in supporting rural services as part of a general drive for rice self-suffi-
ciency. The Government has vigorously implemented a program of agrarian re-
form among rice and corn tenants concentrating mainly on the larger holdings
in the first phase. Titles are being transferred to tenants and supporting
services improved.



- 2 -
S.        The increased activity in agriculture has provided the base for
renewed expansion of the industrial sector.    The growth of industrial produc-
tion for exports has also been stimulated by the Government's Industrial
export drive which included a range of export incentives. Nontraditional
industrial exports, which have been increasing since 1970, are estimated to
have doubled in 1973 to about $200 million.    The prospects of increased
profitabilitv are attracting a large amDunt of new investment into industries
such as plywood, textiles and garnments, handicrafts, light consumer durables
and electronics.
6.        The growth in production was also assisted by the sharply acceler-
ated public development outlays in 1973 made possible by a signlficant iW.-
provement in the financial position of the Government. The Government has
implemented a series of long--needed tax reforms and improvements in tax
administratior., such as customs and tariff reform, tax amnnesties, reforms
in corporate and local taxation, continuation of the export tax, and increased
taxation on luxury itemis and on gasoline. These reforms resulted in a 37%
increase in tax revenues in FY 1973, and an estinated 40% this fiscal year.
As a result the ratio of Central Government tax revenues to GNP has increased
from an average of 9% in recent years to an estimated 129% this fiscal year.
High prices for the Philippines' chief exports, including coconut
products, sugar, copper and wood products, were largely responsible for an
increase in merchandise receipts of almost 70% in 1973.    The merchandise
trade account recordled a surplus of about $270 million, as compared wit.h a
$120 million deficit in the previous year. International reserves rose by
$594 million during the year and stood at $876 million, equivalent to about
five months of imports, at the end of the year.
8.        However, in the latter part of 1973 inflation emerged as a major
problem in. the Philippines.  Since mid-1973 consumner prices have been rising
at an annual rate of more than 40%. This has been caused by the higher rate
or world inflation, bty higher export prices, by domestic food shortages, and
more recently by the increased cost of petroleum.    Provided the Government
obtains sufficient cereal imports for the coming July-September lean period
for domestic supplies, and provide   Lthere is a good harvest later in the
year, the rate of inflation should moderate in 1973, but it probably will
take 1-2 years for the price effects of the energy crisis to work themselves
out fully. Trie rapid inflation has also exacerbated the decline in real
wages whichi fell by a total of about 25% between 1969 and 1973. The urban
wage earners have been most affected. In the past year, agricultural incomes
have improved very substantially, while, with some exceptions, entrepreneurs
have been. able to pass oni increased costs. Money wages will have to be raised
in the near future if further deterioration in the living standards of wage
earners is to be avoided.
The Energy Crisis
9.        Imported petroleum provides some 93% of the Philippines' total
energy requirements. In 1973 the equivalent of 71 million barrels of
petroleum crude and other petroleum products were imported at a cost of
about $230 million e.i.f.   When the energy crisis developed late last year,



-3-
it looked as though economic activity in the Ehilippines would be severely
disrupted. There were temporary dislocations while reduced quantities of
petroleum were available, but the Government moved quickly with conservation
measures to reduce non-essential consumption. By March these problems had
been overcome and the Philippines is now obtaining sufficient petroleum for
its needs. In 1974 imports of petroleum and products are likely to be about
73 million barrels at a cost of about $820 mi.'.lion c.i.f.
10.       In response to the energy crisis the Government has decided to
accelerate the development of local energy sources, especially hydropower
and geothermal energy. These will be supplemented with nuclear energy in
the 1980's. The transport sector, which now accounts for 40% of total
energy consumption, is likely to continue to be the major consumer of energy.
The growth in demand for energy will therefore be influenced by policies
that affect the pattern of expansion in this sector. In any event, total
demand for energy is expected to grow at about 10 percent a year, and even
with more rapid development of natural power sources, petroleum would still
account for 85% of total energy needs by 1980. The Philippines does not
have any commercial oil fields, but the Government has recently taken steps
to encourage more exploration.
Growth Prospects
11.       Earlier this year the Government decided that, despite the energy
crisis and rapid inflation, the growth momentum built up last year should be
maintained, to provide for a continued increase in employment and to ensure
that export income expands rapidly enough to meet most of the country's for-
eign exchange needs. The labor force will continue to grow at almost 3% a
year for another decade. Providing half a million new jobs a year as well
as dealing with unemployment and underemployment will be a major task.
12.       The economy has the potential to continue growing at 7-8% a year
in real terms. This growth is not likely to be seriously constrained by lack
of foreign exchange, for despite the big increase in the cost of petroleum
and other imports, continued high prices for major export commodities will
result in another overall balance of payments surplus this year. Moreover,
the rapid increase in export prices at a time when external debt has not been
changing, has resulted in a sharp fall in debt service from 23% of export
earnings in 1972 to an estimated 14% this year. There has also been a sub-
stantial improvement in the climate for private investment in the Philippines,
especially in exports. Unless there is a calamitous drop in export prices,
the Philippines should be able to maintain a reasonable balance of payments
position throughout the rest of the decade. There will probably be a substan-
tial increase in financing requirements, but with rising domestic incomes and
a substantially improved capacity to borrow abroad, it should be possible
to mobilize the needed resources.
13.       A substantial increase in both public and private investment to
support the growth and employment strategy is required, with priority being
given to increasing food production, to export ventures and to selective
import-replacing investments. The Government plans to spend about P 17 bil-
lion on infrastructure and other public investments during FY 1974-77; about



- 4 -
40% of the proposed investment program would be allocated to the transport
sector, 21% to power and 13% to irrigation. This would mean doubling the pro-
portion of these expenditures to GNP from 1.7% in FY 1968-72 to about 3.5%
in FY 1974-77. To finance this program, the ratio of taxes to GNP would
have to be increased to 15-16%, and public savings would have to be raised
from the present level of 1.4% of GNP to beyond 2% in the next few years.
With the Government's program for further tax reforms, there are reasonable
prospects for achieving these objectives. Even so, it would mean continued
heavy reliance on public borrowing from the local market and from abroad.
Implementing this program would also call for continued improvements in
public sector management which has already been strengthened by the Govern-
ment reorganization.
14.       The improved climate for private investment is attributable to the
strong performance of the economy in 1973 after three years of stagnation,
the current higher prices for many commodities, and the efforts of Govern-
ment to attract more foreign investment. A number of big projects are pro-
posed in mining, wood processing, fertilizer, steel, aluminum and other
industries which seem likely to push up the private investment rate from
recent levels of about 16% of GNP to perhaps 22% by the latter part of the
decade. A large portion of the funds for these projects is likely to come
from abroad. Even so, the supply of long-term funds from domestic sources
will need to increase substantially.
Balance of Payments
15.       Because of continued high prices for major export commodities,
export receipts are expected to increase by 33% this year to $2.5 billion.
Merchandise imports are likely to increase by about 66% to $2.6 billion,
largely because of the increased cost of petroleum. In response to the
energy crisis the Central Bank negotiated a series of standby credits with
various foreign commercial banking groups earlier this year. However, be-
cause of the improved outlook for export receipts, these standby credits may
not be used this year. The economic mission estimates that the overall
balance of payments will record a surplus of about $250 million this year,
with international reserves increasing to about $1.1 billion, the equivalent
of about 3-1/2 months of imports. With export prices continuing at relatively
high levels, a small deficit in the overall balance of payments is likely in
1975.
16.       After allowing for continued reserve accumulation and repayment of
loans, the total foreign exchange requirements for the period 1975-79 would
be about $7 billion. About $2.5 billion would be provided by remittances,
official grants, direct investment, and short-term trade finance. The re-
maining $4.5 billion would have to come from foreign borrowing. Last year
the Bank estimated total requirements for 1974-78 at about $4 billion. In
June 1973 the Consultative Group for the Philippines met and accepted the
need for rising levels of commitments for development projects to support
the Philippines' increased development program. The increased estimate of
requirements reflects the effects of inflation, the more optimistic outlook
for growth in the Philippines, and the improved capacity to carry foreign
debt.



-5-
17.       Borrowing on this scale would not pose serious problems for balance
of payments and external debt management. At the end of 1973, the Philippines'
medium and long-term external debt stood at about $1.9 billion, of which pub-
lic debt was 44%. Because the Government has exercised strict control over
the amount and type of new external borrowings, the total amount of debt out-
standing has not increased much since 1970, and the maturity structure has
improved. Moreover, the debt service ratio is expected to remain at about
14% in 1975. With this moderate debt burden the Philippines will be able to
contract substantially larger amounts of external debt which would probably
lead to a small increase in the debt service ratio, perhaps to about 14-15%
by the early 1980s.
18.       The Philippines' development program will continue to require re-
sources in excess of the foreign capital which will become available for fi-
nancing the import component of development projects. Some financing of local
currency expenditures will be justified, especially for projects of economic
and social importance which need only limited amounts of foreign exchange.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES
19.       The Philippines has received 23 Bank loans and three IDA credits
totalling $466 million, net of cancellations. About 48% of the Bank/IDA
lending, about $225 million, has been for infrastructure projects in power,
transportation, water supply and for education. The remainder has been
divided about equally between agriculture and industry. About $126 million
of this has been for irrigation, livestock, rice processing and rural credit
and about $115 million for industry in three loans to the Private Development
Corporation of the Philippines and one loan to the Development Bank of the
Philippines. There has been a marked improvement in the way our projects
in the Philippines have been executed in the last two or three years compared
with experience in the 1960's when shortages of peso counterpart funds com-
bined with poor administration caused serious problems. Apart from the rice
processing project, where some major changes made necessary by changed
circumstances have been proposed, all our projects are now going well.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC
investments as of May 31, 1974, and notes on the execution of on-going
projects.
20.       The size of our lending program increased substantially in FY1974
reflecting the ambitious development program of the Government and its
improved capacity to prepared and implement projects. Our lending in FY1974
amounted to $165.1 million compared to an average of about $30 million a year
in the previous five years. Future Bank lending will continue to concentrate
on public infrastructure and agriculture. We will also continue to help
industry and provide more assistance for projects in the social sectors.
21..      The following projects are among those which may be ready for Board
consideration in FY 1975 - Population, Inter-Island Shipping, Tarlac Irriga-
tion, Mindoro Rural Development and Small Industry. The population project
would assist the broad objectives of the population program and strengthen



- 6 -
the health and famuily planning delivery system of the Department of Health.
The loan for inter-island shipping would be relent through DBP to private
shipping companies for the acquisition of new and used ships and conversion
and repairs of existing ships of the inter-island fleet. The Tarlac Irriga-
tion project would help rehabilitate irrigation systems in a lheavily tenanted
area of Central Luzon, while the Rural Development project would help finance
a range of rural investments designed to promote the integrated development
of the island of Mindoro. The small industry loan would provide funds for
relending to small firms and technical assistance to help strengthen the
institutions serving these firms.
22.       Since 1972 the Philippines has received a limited amount of assist-
anice from IDA, but on the basis of a reappraisal of the prospects for the
Philippines' balance of payments in the light of changes in commodity prices,
and in view of the sharply increased needs of the poorer members of IDA for
conicessional assistance, further IDA lending to the Philippines does not
appear to be justified. The Philippines now has the capacity to borrow
larger amounts abroad to meet the needs of the increased investment program
now planned. The Bank's share in this higher level of foreign borrowing
will be reviewed in the light of the findings of the recent economic mission.
At present, the Bank/IDA share in total debt outstanding is about 9% and its
share in debt service is about 5.5%. Since the Philippines will have the
capacity to service more commercial debt in future, it is unlikely that the
Bank's share in debt service will rise even with a higher level of lending.
23.       IFC has made commitments in the Philippines totalling $68.0 mil-
lion for investments in ten companies in the fields of development banking,
power, telecommunications, ceramic tiles, paper, petroleum products, nickel
mining and refining, chemicals and synthetic fibers. Of these investments,
as of May 31, 1974, $18.2 million have been sold, $0.4 million cancelled
and $1.3 million repaid, leaving a net portpolio of $47.6 million.    On the
same date $12.6 million was undisbursed. Preliminary proposals have been
received for an aluminum smelter and other projects in the pulp and paper,
dinner ware, metal alloys and shipbuilding fields.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
24.       Development of the power sector in the Philippines has been
hindered by haphazard planning and poor coordination, particularly between
the National Power Corporation (NPC) and the Manila Electric Company (MECO),
the two largest entities. This arose partly from a strained relationship
between NPC, which is wholly Government owned, and MECO, which is privately
owned. A major change in sector policy occurred with the publication of
Presidential Decree No. 40 of November 7, 1972. A long range electrification
program, involving industrial development, dispersal of industry and rural
electrification, was announced based upon establishing island grids, integ-
rating power generating systems and consolidating electric distribution
franchise systems.   NPC was made responsible for the construction of national
grids, the development of all future generation supplying the grids, and
ultimately for owning and operating all generating facilities. However the



- 7 -
terms and timing of the implied transfer of MECO's existing generating
facilities remain to be decided. The National Electrification Administration
(NEA) was made responsible for reorganizing the distribution sector and
implementing rural electrification, while the Power Development Council was
to prepare an integrated plan of electrification and power development and
to coordinate its implementation.
25.       The Philippines is not rich in energy resources.    Coal deposits
are limited in amount and quality and although some gas reserves have been
found, they are insignificant for the electric power sector. More than 90%
of total energy consumption and 80% of electric generation is thermal and
dependent on imported oil. The energy crisis has accelerated the Govern-
ment's plans for development of indigenous geothermal and hydro energy and of
nuclear power. The hydroelectric potential is estimated at 3,600 MW, two-
thirds in Luzon and one-third in Mindanao; 16% of this has already been
developed. The capacity of the geothermal field at Tiwi, Southern Luzon
has been estimated at several hundred megawatts and NPC has begun development
of a geothermal plant there. A feasibility study for a nuclear power plant
has been completed and a 600 MW nuclear power unit is planned for operation
in the early 1980's.
26.       Electricity supply nationwide is provided by more than 400
utilities of which one-quarter are public, including NPC. The remainder are
privately owned, of which the Manila Electric Company (21ECO) is much the
largest. MECO now accounts for 66% and NPC for 26% of the country's totai
generation, the remaining 8% being provided by small self-generating
utilities. MECO depends almost entirely on oil-fired thermal generation
while NPC's generation is primarily from hydroelectric resources.
27.       MECO serves the Greater Manila area and expects load growth to
increase at about 8% a year as it has in the recent past. NPC is a bulk
supplier and serves 177 small electric utilities and 104 non-utility
customers throughout the Philippines. NPC's load growth has increased by
15% a year during the last five years, reflecting the Government's policy
of total electrification. However, electrification is far from complete
and rural areas in particular have only limited service. In Luzon, the
most developed region, 242 small towns and villages out of a total 636 have
no power supply at all.
28.       Before the energy crisis NCP's long-term generation expansion
program for the combined NPC-MECO Luzon grid, and the Visayas and Mindanao
regions was expected to almost double total capacity from 2058 MW in 1973 to
4018 MW in 1980. To finance this program, total investment of about US$463
million is planned in FY1975-78 to be financed from internally generated
funds (15%), borrowing (84%), and equity contributions (1%). NPC requires
US$286 million in foreign currency financing. It has firm commitments of
US$157 million including the proposed loan. Arrangements for the balance
are being discussed with bilateral and multilateral donors. NPC will raise
the required peso financing (US$177 million equivalent) through retained
earnings (39%), sale of bonds (59%) and equity contributions (2%). In
response to the energy crisis the government and NPC are now revising the



above program in order to further accelerate hydro, geothermal and nuclear
power developments and reduce dependence on oil-fired thermal plants. The
new program will probably increase NPC's total investment requirements. In
considering the size of the new program NPC will have to take account of its
ability to raise and service foreign and domestic borrowings.
29.       NPC and MECO have been operating independently with only seasonal
and emergency exchange of energy between the two systems. Joint operation
in the future will yield technical and economic advantages and will be
necessary when MECO becomes dependent on NPC for its power supply. The
NPC-MECO task force study on "combined operation" of the two systems would
be reviewed by the consultants who would prepare a feasibility study for a
load dispatching center (para 37). In Mindanao, NPC plans to increase
installed hydro capacity on the Agus River from 150 MW in 1973 to 440 MW
in 1978.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.       The proposed project was identified by a Bank mission in June
1973. A Bank mission appraised the project in November/December 1973 and
negotiations were held in May 1974. The leader of the Government's negotiating
team was Ambassador Eduardo Z. Romualdez. The Appraisal Report (No. 421-PH)
on the proposed project is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors. Annex III provides a loan and project summary.
Description of Project
31.       The proposed project would provide for the construction of the
100 MW Pantabangan hydro power plant and another portion of the transmission
system expansion program in Luzon. The Pantabangan hydro power plant is
an addition of power generating facilities to the dam and reservoir being
financed under the Bank loan for the Upper Pampanga River Project (UPRP)
(Ln. 637-PH). Two 50 MW units would be installed and a re-regulation
dam would be built downstream of the plant to regulate the river flow for
irrigation purposes. The plant would have a firm capacity of 70 MW and
would supply the Luzon grid via a 230 KV transmission line. Commissioning
is planned for April 1977. The Luzon transmission grid would be extended
by constructing about 210 km of 230 kv and about 535 km of 69 kv transmission
lines and 33 substations with a capacity of 1,375 MVA. Of this, about 250 km
of 69 kv lines and 13 substations (75 MVA), included in the Fifth Power loan
but for which bids have not been invited, have been transferred to this project,
because funds in the Fifth Power loan are insufficient to finance the total
project as defined at the time of that loan (Loan Agreement, Section 7.02).
This is because of sharp cost increases since 1971. The present cost of the
transferred items is $10.1 million. The transmission expansion program would
be complete by December 1977. The loan would finance the feasibility studies
for the Chico River hydro power development, which was identified as one of
the better potential areas in Luzon for power generation by studies financed
under the Fifth Power loan and credit. It would also finance a study to
determine the site and detailed design for a dispatching center for NPC. This



- 9 -
would permit effective pooling operations of the combined NPC-MECO system
and efficient use of the second Bataan thermal unit when it becomes operational.
The Borrower
32.       NPC was created in 1936 and in 1960 was converted to a stock
corporation wholly owned by the government. Presidential Decree No. 380
of January 22, 1974 revised NPC's Charter by raising the authorized share
capital from P 300 million to P 2,000 million, by raising the total peso
indebtedness ceiling from P 500 million to P 3,000 million and by placing
NPC under the direct supervision of the Office of the President. The life
of the corporation, due to expire on January 4, 1976, was extended by 50
years.
33.       NPC's management was hampered in the past by inadequate organization
and management information. With the advice of consultants financed under
earlier Bank loans, NPC has now reorganized its management, overhauled its
accounting and reporting procedures and provided on-the-spot training for
staff implementing the revised procedures. All this has provided the neces-
sary base for NPC to become a well-managed utility. The most recent revision
of the Charter authorized NPC to prescribe a standard form of contract for
the supply of power, and appropriate rules and regulations for uniform
application to apply to both new and existing customers; permitted NPC to
sell bulk supplies of power to enterprises in franchised areas; simplified
NPC's compensation procedures; and directed that all industrial disputes of
the Corporation will be settled by compulsory arbitration. This has further
strengthened NPC.
34.       The Bank Group has made five loans and one credit to the Nationial
Power Corporation (NPC); the most recent of which was a loan of $22.0 million
(Ln. 809-PH) and a credit of $10.0 million (CR. 296-PH) made in 1972 to
finance the Bataan No. 2 unit and a part of NPC's ongoing transmission
program. Following initial delays, this project is proceeding satisfactorily
and commissioning is now expected in April 1976, about 10 months behind the
original schedule.
roject Execution
35.       The National Irrigation Authority (NIA) would execute the Pantabauigan
plant on behalf of NPC under the terms of a Memorandum of Agreement on Imple-
mentation of the Power Phase of the Upper Pampanga River Project (UPRP) between
NIA and NPC dated January 22, 1973. The Pantabangan plant is one part of the
UPRP, a major on-going multipurpose project, for which the NIA is executing
agency. Since NIA already has shown itself fully capable of managing the
UPRP project, the Government decided that it should be responsible for con-
structing the Pantabangan plant as well. NPC would cooperate very closely
with NIA and supplement NIA personnel to ensure efficient implementation of
the project. Under the Agreement, NPC would be the borrower for the Bank loan
and responsible to the Bank for salisfactory compleLion of the project, in-
cluding procurement. NPC would own the facilities on completion of the project
and water releases would be in accordance with guidelines set out by NIA. NPC
would bear only the incremental costs of the power phase. The civil works



- 10 -
contractor for UPRP will undertake the Pantabangan civil works under the terms
of a negotiated contract, in order to implement the Pantabangan project as soon
as possible. These works would not be financed by the proposed loan, but
additional materials and equipment needed by the contractor would be financed
by the loan and procured through international competitive bidding. NPC
would execute the transmission projects and carry out engineering and
construction supervision of the transmission projects using its own staff.
NPC's experience makes this arrangement satisfactory.
Cost and Financing of the Project
36.       The estimated total cost of the project is $84.5 million, with
a foreign exchange component of $56.0 million (66% of total project costs).
The estimates include the cost of a small number of items which may be
manufactured locally. They also include a 5% allowance on all items for
physical contingencies and an allowance for annual price increases of 7.5%
to 18%, depending upon the particular item and the year in which it would
be purchased. The proposed Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange
component of $56.0 million, and interest during construction of $5.0 million
for a total loan of $61.0 million. The local cost component of $28.5 million
and interest during construction of $2.4 million would be financed by NPC
from internally generated funds and sales of bonds.

37.       NPC has a history of chronic financial problems, due in large
p;rt to difficulties in securing timely rate increases.    Recognizing this,
the Govertnment amended NPC's Charter in September 1971 to exempt NPC rate
acttons from lower court injunctions and to exempt NPC from all taxes

including income and other taxes. However the rate of return for FY 1974
is forecast at only 6.2% compared to the minimum of 8% required under the
Bank's fifth power loan to NPC (809-PH) and which would be required under the
proposed loan (Loan Agreement, Section 5.05(a)).    NPC has reviewed its tariff
schedule and is implementing increases to be effective on July 1, 1974,
which should yield sufficient revenue to achieve the required overall rate
of return of 8% in FY 1975. NPC has agreed to take the action necessary
to reduce unpaid bills to not more than the revenue of the previous 3 months
by December 31, 1976 (Loan Agreement, Section 5.06). A special committee
has been set up, chaired by the Executive Secretary, to look into the
management and financial affairs of NPC's delinquent customers. The Govern-
ment has allowed the cement companies, who are the worst delinquents, to
increase cement prices by 40%.
38.       As in previous agreements with the Bank, NPC has agreed to seek
Bank approval before incurring any long-term debt if its revenue is less
than 1.3 times the maximum debt service for any succeeding year, including
the debt to be incurred. As in the past, the Government will ensure that
NPC obtains the domestic capital required for its investment program. In
considering the size of its future investment program, NPC will have to take
account of its ability to raise and service foreign and domestic borrowings.
39.       A fuel adjustment clause for NPC's rate schedule in Luzon became
effective in July 1973. This empowers NPC to pass on to the consumer any
variation in the average cost of fossil fuel above a stipulated base price.
In November 1973 the cost of fuel oil at NPC's Bataan Thermal Plant was $4.40
per barrel, which was included in the average price of $1.05 cents per kwh
sold by NPC to its Luzon customers. A doubled fuel oil price would raise
the average price to customers by US$0.19 cents per kwh, equivalent to an 18t',
tariff increase.
40.       NPC has a service contract with an international company to
provide geothermal steam for the Tiwi project. Payment will be subject to
escalation according to mutually acceptable cost indices still to be arranged,
but subject to geothermal power remaining competitive with alternative gene-
rating sources. Before the Tiwi geothermal plant is commissioned in 1979,
NPC's fuel clause formula will need to be amended to cover changes in the
cost of steam.
Procurement
41.       The goods and services to be financed by the proposed loan,
including basic materials and equipment for civil works construction, would
be procured through international competitive bidding in accordance withi
the Bank's Guidelines. Since some of the project items may be manufactured
locally, a preference of 15% of the c.i.f. price of imported goods or the
custom duty if lower, would be extended to domestic manufacturers in the
evaluation of bids. Bidding for the Pantabangan project and the items
transferred from the Fifth Power Project is underway but no contracts would
be awarded before the loan is approved. On the basis of the present procure-
ment schedulle, it is unlikely that contracts would be ready for award before
the loan is signed.



- 12 -
Disbursement
42.       Disbursements would be made against 100% of the c.i.f. cost of
imported equipment, 100% of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured
equipment and 100% of the foreign expenditures for professional services.
Retroactive financing is recommended for about $100,000 for foreign costs
of consultants' services incurred between December 1, 1973 and loan signing.
Economic Justification
43.       Electricity consumption in Luzon for the combined NPC-MECO
interconnected system has increased at 10% a year since 1967; and is fore-
cast to grow at about the same rate, up to 1982. However the growth rate
in energy requirements and peak demand in NPC's market is expected to remain
substantially higher than for MECO's, reflecting the Government's policy of
rural electrification.
44.       When the Malaya No. 2 thermal unit is completed in 1978, the
combined NPC-MECO system will meet energy requirements up to 1981.    However
a deficit is expected in peak-supply capability from the dry season in 1977
onwards. NPC's four hydro plants do not have sufficient reservoir capacity.
Consequently their plant capacities are reduced to only 302 MW in the
December to June dry season compared to 427 M.W during the wet season.
Irrigation releases from the Pantabangan reservoir, with their potential
for power generation in the dry season, would complement the existing power
system. The Pantabangan project would be more economical than gas turbine
capacity, the only alternative peaking source, for discount rates up to 35%.
The financial return on the Pantabangan plant would be 18% on the basis of
additional revenues.
45.       The transmission facilities comprise two parts.    One would
connect the Tiwi geothermal plant to the Mfanila area increasing the
electricity supply available to MFCO; the other would extend electricity
supply by 1980 to about 130 towns and municipalities not connected to the
Luzon grid, and connect about 60 large consumers including 27 pumped
irrigation projects to the NPC grid. Of the towns to be connected, 60 now
rely on small high-cost diesel plants and 70 have no electricity supply at
all. These grid connections would make reliable, lower cost electricity
available to consumers and would encourage pumped irrigation, agro-industry
development and the dispersal of industry. A rate of return for the
transmission projects was not calculated because of the difficulties in
quantifying benefits and allocating incremental revenues to the facilities.
NPC however has justified each of the rural electrification projects as
the optimum scheme for the purpose.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.       The draft Loan Agreement between the National Power Corporation
and the Bank, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of the



- 13 -
Philippines and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article IIl, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and
the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being
distributed separately to the Executive Directors. The draft agreements
conform to the normal pattern for loans for power projects.
47.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
48.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.   Projects in Execution -
Ln. No. 607-PH      Second Rural Credit; US$12_.5' million Loan of
June 4, 1969; Closing Date:   June 30, 1974
The slow progress of the project at the beginning was mainly
due to the steep rise in the prices of farm machinery after the peso was
allowed to float in February 1970.   the subsequent increases in prices of
farm produce together with decentralization of loan approvals, strengtheTn-
ing of staff and promotional efforts have helped improve the pace of
disbursement. This has particularly quickenied over the last nine months.
The Closing Date, originally March 31, 1973,, has been postponed to
June 30, 1974.  As of March 25, 1974, a balance of only $42,450 remained
uncommitted.
Ln. No. 637-PH      Irrigation; US$34.0 million Loan of August 18, 1969;
Closing Date: June 30, 19-76
This is the first major irrigation project in the Philippines
and will supply water year-round to nearly 77,000 hectares. The project's
on-farm development scheme is setting a pattern for future irrigation
development in the country. Some delays were caused by the 1972 floods
but construction of the dam is now progressing ahead of schedule. All
work is expected to be completed and the loan fully disbursed by June 30,
1976, the original completion date. Project costs have increased 34 percent
over appraisal estimates largely due to inflation, devaluation of the peso
and design changes in the dam. However, as a result of close coordination
established between irrigation and agricultural supporting services, the
project is expected to reach full development in 7 years after completion
of construction instead of 13 years as appraised. The project remains
economically viable.
Ln. No. 720-PH      Rice Processing and Storagei US$14.3 million Loan of
February 4, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
This project provides long-term credit through the Development Bank
oi the Philippines to finance a program for the development and modernization
of the private sector of the rice processing industry. It included six large
integrated processing plants to produce the high quality rice required for
the anticipated exportable surplus, which did not materialize owing to set-
backs in rice production. The President's memorandum to the Executive
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 6 pages
Directcrs dated June 8, 1972 (R72-LO) proposed amendments to the loan
agreement to shift the emphasis to rehabilitation of existing facilities
and to streanilire procuren,ent procedures.  In spite of this the project
has made very little progress and by the end of February 197h, only
US$O. r million had been disbursed.  During the critical shortage of rice
las-. year the Government successfully encouraged an increase in maize
production, and the consumption of maize mixed with rice.   This has led to
a demand for maize processing, storage and handling facilities, and
Government has proposed the project be expanded to include grains other
than rice.   Much of the new demand will come from public entities and
small individuals, so that Government has proposed they also be included,
and that the minimum size of sub-loan be reduced to cover the smaller
processors.   These amendments, designed to widen the project's objectives,
to cover the changed conditions and to facilitate speedy and full
implementation, were presented to the Executive Directors in the President's
Memorandum dated April 15, 1974 (Sec M7h-2b4).   The Executive Directors
approved the proposals and the Loan Agreement has been amended accordingly.
Ln No 731-PH    Highway;  US $8.0 million Loan of April 14, 1971;
Closing Date: May 15, 1975
The project for the constructior. and improvement of the Cotabato-
Digos road (160 km) in Mindanao is in general progressing satisfactorily.
Work was suspended in March 1973 because of civil disturbances in the
Cotabato area, but the contractor has since resumed work from the Digos
end which is outside the area affected by the fighting.   The project also
includes two components financed by UNDP: technical assistance to the
Bureau of Public Highways (BPH) for operational improvements and feasibility
studies for future highway projects.   Work on the technical assistance
component is progressing well and the feasibility studies have been
completed.
Ln No 809-PH and   Fifth Power;  US $22.0 million and US $10.0 million loan
Cr No 296-PH       and Credit of April 3, 1972; Closing date:   June 30, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
ilinance the construction of a second thermal unit of l10-MW at Bataan and
t,rans'iission facilities in Luzon.  The project is behind schedule because
procirrement has taken longer than expected.  The Closing Date has been
rostponed to June 30, 1978 to allow time for delayed procurement and because
retention monies will not be paid to the major equipment supplier until
at least, one year after the plant is commissioned.  A tariff increase was
imposed in January 1973 because of rapid domestic inflation.   The situation
lhas also been improved by the imposition in July 1973 of a surcharge to
cover increased fuel costs.   A further tariff increase has been approved,
effective July 1, 197L and this should enable NPC to achieve its covenanted
rate of return in FY 74/75.

PROCUREMENT:              (a)  Goods and services, including additional
materials and equipment for civil works
construction, would be procured through inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's guidelines. Since some of
the project items may be manufactured locally
a preference limited to 15% of the c.i.f. price
of imported goods, or the customs duty if lower,
would be extended to domestic manufacturers
in the evaluation of bids.
(b) Civil works for the Pantabangan project will
be undertaken by the UPRP contractor under
the terms of a negotiated contract. This
contract would not be financed by the Bank.
CONSULTANTS     Consultants (Engineering Consultants, Inc. and
Engineering Development Corporation) were appointed
by NPC to prepare the specifications for the power
phase of the Upper Pampanga River Project and will
continue as the consultants during its implementation.
Consultants (Lahmeyer International Gmbh.) were
appointed by NPC to conduct the feasibility studies
for one power plant on the Chiico River. Consultants
for the dispatching center study have yet to be
selected.
RATE OF RETURN:           The Pantabangan project would be more economical
than gas turbine capacity for discount rates up
to 35%. Fuel cost savings would be larger than
the cost of the Pantabangan plant for discount
rates up to 16%. The financial return on the
Pantabangan plant wouldl be 18%. No rates of return
were calculated for the transmission items.
