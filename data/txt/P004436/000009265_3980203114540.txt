SIXTII POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1034-PR)
PROJECT COMPLETIONI REPORT
Preface
The project comprised construction of a 100 NW hydroelectric power
plant at Pantabangan, on the Pampanga river in Luzon; various transmission
lines and substations on Luzon; and feasibility studies for another
hydropower plant and for a load dispatching center for the Luzon grid. The
borrower was the 'National Power Corporation (NPC), which implemented the
transmission component of the project; the generation component was
implemented by the National Irrigation Adwinistration (NIA).
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the East Asia
and Pacific Regional Office on the basis of the Appraisal Report,
Supervision Reports and other docunents in the Bank's files, Completion
Reports prepared by NPC and NIA, and a project completion mission to the
Philippines.
A project audit was not performed by the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED).
Following standard OED procedures, a copy of the draft report
was sent to the Borrower (NPC) and to the Government of the Philippines
for comment. Comments were received from NPC and from the National Econo-
mic Development Authority (NEDlA); they are reproduced at Annex 13 and have
been taken into account in finalizing the report.

SIXTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1034-PH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Hlighlights
The objectives of the project were the expansion of the
availability of electric power through extension of the transmis6ion systen
to facilitate connection of further rural electric coope-ratives, and the
augmentation of NPC's peak generating capability. The project was successful
in achieving both of these objectives, as evidenced by the growth of energy
sales in provincial Luzon, which advanced at an average of over 10% p.a.
between 1977 and 1980 without deterioration in the reliability of service
(para. 6.05). Facilities constructed under the project have operated
satisfactorily since entry into coamercial use (paras. 3.23-3.24). However,
some of the subprojects in the transmission component were completed very
late (para. 3.03).  Changes in the design of various subcomponents and slow
procurement procedures were the principal causes of delay (paras. 3.04-3.09).
Largely as a consequence of this slippage, there was a considerable cost
overrun, especially on the local currency element (para. 3.19). The genera-
tion component was completed on time, and although there was a cost overrun
it was largely attributable to exceptional circumstances (para. 3.18). This
component shows a satisfactory rate of return in terms of fuel oil savings
(pars. 6.03).
NPC's financial condition was under considerable pressure during
the period of project construction as a result of the rapid rise in fuel
costs (para. 4.03) and the burden of debt service associated with its
substantial development program (para. 4.05).  Tariffs did not keep pace
wlth the increase in NPC's costs and, as a result, NPC was unable to meet
the rate of return target of 8% covenanted with the Bank (para. 4.06).



PHILIPPIRNS
SIXTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1034-PH)
Project Completion Report
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The supply of electric power in the Philippines involves a number
of entities in both the public and private sectors. Power generation is prin-
cipally the responsibility of the National Power Corporation (NPC), which
transmits it to a number of large industrial users, and to the retail distri-
butors. These include a number of private utilities, of which MgRALCO,
serving the Metro Manila area, is by far the largest, municipalities, and
over 100 rural electric cooperatives.
1.02      Since 1957, the Bank has made nine loans to the power sector in the
Philippines amounting to US$290.2 million equivalent, including seven loans
amiounting to US$218.2 million to NPC.  The first loan to NPC (183-PH,
US$18.4 million, 1957) helped finance the Binga Hydroelectric Project and
the second (297-PH, US$33.5 million, 1961) financed the Angat Hydroelectric
Project. The third loan (325-PH, US$3.3 million, 1962) was used to finance
the third unit of the Maria Cristina hydroelectric power plant, located in
Mindanao. The fourth loan (491-PH, US$12.0 million, 1967) was used for the
construction pf a thermal power plant (75 MW) at Bataan, Luzon, and addition
of a fourth unit at Maria Cristina hydropower plant. The fifth loan
(809-PH, US$22.0 million, 1972) and credit (296-PH, US$10.0 million, 1972)
financed the second (150 MW) steam power plant at Bataan and extensions to
the transmission system. Apart from considerable slippage in the project
construction schedules and a consequential cost overrun on the fifth
project, all these projects were completed without major problems and are
operating satisfactorily. The sixth power project, financed by Loan
1034-PH, is the subject of this report. The seventh loan, which is the
Bank's latest operation with NPC (1460-PH, US$58.0 million, 1977) is
financing the expansion of the transmission system in Luzon and construction
of a load dispatching center, and is expected to be completed in 1984.
1.03      Bank Group lending to the Philippines power sector has also
included: (a) a loan to the National Electrification Administration (NEA)
for US$60 million in 1978 to help finance the 1979/80 portion of the rural
electrification program; and (b) a commitment by the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) equivalent to US$12 million in 1967 to MERALCO.

II.  PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Original Project Description
2.0l      The original project description for the NPC Sixth Power Project
included the following items:
(a) Generation, Construction of Pantabangan hydropower plant (100 MW)
as a part of the multi-purpose Upper Panpanga River Project,
already being assisted by the Bank under Loan 637-PH. The power
addition financed by this loan includes:
(i)  construction of an enclosed type power plant at the foot of
the dam and installation of two 50 MW turbine generators;
(ii)  construction of a switchyard adjacent to the power house with
two 64 MVA step-up transformers and associated 230 kV
switching equipment;
(iii)  construction of a 230 kV double-circuit transmission line
about 23 km long to connect the Pantabangan plant to the
existing 230 kV Luzon grid; and
(iv) construction of a re-regulation data about 24 m high between
the power plant and the downstream irrigation diversion dam.
(b)  Transmission.  A transmission program for Ilocos, Central .uzon,
Zamfbales, Laguna, Batangas, Southern Luzon regions and a
"Special Project" (consisting of isolated works in various other
regions), comprising altogether:
(i) 301 km of 230 kV lines;/l
(ii) 444 km of 69 kV lines;/l
(iii)  33 substations with a total capacity of 1,375 EVA.
Of these, 91 km of 230 kV lines, 162 km of 69 kV lines and 13
substations (75 MVA) originally included in the Fifth Power

Changes to the Project
2.02      The scope of the project remained essentially the same as
envisaged at appraisal, with the exception detail changes in the works
for the transmission expansion program and the suspension of design work
in Chico II.
2.03      During implementation of the transmission expansion program, a
large number of detailed changes in sub-projects were made. The changes,
however, did not affect the original objectives to meet increasing demands
of existing NPC customers in the Luzon grid and to ex.end electricity supply
to rural areas.
2.04      Major changes in transmission subprojects include the following:
(a)  Several transmission lines were rerouted or revised after more
detailed investigation, either to avoid poor soil conditions which
would necessitate the use of costly special foundations or to
avoid traversing more populated areas. This resulted in changes
to the terminating points and/or originating points of the lines,
as well as relocation of substation sites.
(b)  Some load-end substations were already provided by the Electric
Cooperatives in their areas, hence the intended substation
equipment for the specific areas was allocated to other areas.
(c)  Some transmission lines, which were proposed to pass specific
areas as indicated in the original study, were rerouted to other
areas where such lines were more urgently needed to supply
increased demands for electricity.
Annex 1 shows details of these changes, which also indicates the increases
or decreases in length of the lines.
2.05      A comparison between the original estimates and actual lengths of
transmission lines and capacity of substations is shown below.  The overall
result was a net decrease in lengths of transmission line and numbers of
substations, suggesting that implementation changes resulted in better and
more economical routing of lines and location of substations. Details are
shown in Annex 2.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ANI) COST
Project Execution
Pantabangan Hydropower Plant
3.01      The construction of the Pantabangan Hydropower Plant was implemented
by the National Irrigation Administration, which already had responsibility
for construction works at the damsite as part of the Upper Pampanga irrigation
scheme. The civil works were undertaken by Hydro Resources Contractors
Corporation. The Engineering Consultants of Denver, Colorado, together with
the Engineering and Development Corporation of the Philippines, provided
engineering consulting services.
3.02      The Pantabangan Hydropower Plant, the downstream Masiway re-regula-
tion dam and the associated transmission line to the Luzon grid were completed
on schedule as appraised. The first 50 111W generating unit was placed into
commercial operation on April 10, 1977. Commercial operation of Unit No. 2
commenced on April 15, 1977. The project was officially turned over to XPC
for operation and maintenance in June 1977.
Transmission
3.03      The transmission program for Ilocos, Central Luzon, Zambales,
Laguna, Batangas, Southern Luzon regions and Special Project was less than
half completed by the scheduled date of December 1977; the final subproject
was completed only in December 1982. The delays in execution of the trans-
mission subprojects were mainly due to inadequate planning and the slow pace
of engineering design, delays in procurement and acquisition of right-of-way.
These are described briefly below; suggestions for improvement of performance
in future projects are at para. 7.03.
3.04      The loan was signed on July 31, 1974 and became effective in
November of that year. The only funds utilized in the first twelve months
from effectiveness were the $8 million portion of the loan allocated to the
cost overruns in the Fifth Power Project (Loan 809-PH and IDA Credit 296-PH),
in order to 'ontinue the ongoing construction of lines and substations that
were being carried over to the Sixth Power Project.
3.05      NPC delegated the planning, surveying and  construction functions to
the regional offices, but retained all design activity at headquarters. Head
office staff design all the details for each and every project of NPC, regard-
less of type, voltage or capacity. This has created a tremendous burden on
the design division at headquarters, wihich contributed to the delay in
implementation.
3.06      Survey and the preparation of plans and specifications were done
mostly in the latter part of 1975, and it took almost the entire year of 1976
and a part of 1977 for NPC to advertise, bid out, evaluate bids and recommend



- 6 -
award up to contract approval for the supply contracts for furnishing and
delivering of transmission line materials, steel towers and substation
equipment and accessories.
3.07      About 50% of the 230 kV transmission line from Naga-San Antonio-
Tiwi and San Antonio-Daraga bed to be rerouted, new soil tests conducted,
and special tower foundations redesigned, due to poor soil conditions in
that area. This accounted for about a 30% time delay, based on the
construction contract time.
3.08      Almost 70% of the line routes were affected by right-of-way
problems where landowners and tenants refused entry unless their
right-of-way claims were settled outright.
3.09      Numerous delays in the delivery of transmission line materials and
substation equipment naturally affected the local labor contracts for
construction of the transmission system, so that final completion of one
subproject was on December 31, 1982, which is five years later than target
completion date.
Feasibility Studieq
3.10      The feasibility study of Chico River hydropower development was
completed. However, due to the local security problem the consultant could
not get necessary data for the completion of Chico II definite design.
3.11      The feasibility study of NPC's dispatching center was completed.
The dispatching center was financed by the Bank's Seventh Power Project and
is now under construction.
Procurement and Award of Main Contracts
3.12      Procurement of the equipment and materials for the Pantanbangan
Hydropower Project was arranged through 16 contract packages during September
1974 through August 1976. The contract of hydroturbines governors and inlet
valves was awarded to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (Japan). Generators,
transformers and associated equipment was awarded to Mitsubishi rlectric
Corporation (Japan). Details of other contracts are given in Annex 3.
3.13      The major civil works contract for the Pantanbangan Hydropower
Project was divided into two contract schedules. Schedule I covers the
construction of the powerhouse complex while Schedule II i%ivolves the
construction of the Masiway re-regulation dam and appurtenant structures.
The whole contract was negotiated with Hydro Resources Contractors Corpora-
tion as an extension of Contract for construction of the Pantabangan Dam.
Payments for the contract work were made. under two categories, the fixed
price and cost plus basis.
3.14      The contracts for the transmission program were awarded between
1974 and 1980. Those for transmission equipment and materials were awarded



- 7 -
mainly to foreign s:uppliers thronpgh local. representatives; t.hose for
construction and installation works were awarded to local contractors.
Details of major contracts are given in Annex 3.
3.15      Despite the delivery periods set in the procurement and construc-
tion schedule of the transmission program, most of the deliveries by
suppliers were delayed by about six months and the longest delnys in the
deliveries were by:  (a) Apar Private Ltd. - an Indian firm, for the supply
of conductors, delayed by 27 months; (b) Connell Bros. for the supply of
substation steel structures and grounding materials, delayed by 41 months;
(c) Kanematsu Gosho for the supply of metal clad switchgears, delayed for
36 months; (d) Kanematsu for the supply of power transformers, delayed for
31 months; and (e) Dodsal Private Ltd. for the supply of steel towers and
transmissioni line materials, delayed for 22 months.  Late deliveries were
mostly without peralty. The award, and later the contract approval for the
turnkey contract fcr the Dolores-Sapang Palay 230 kV transmission line, was
delayed by more than two years.
Project Cost
3.16      The actual total project cost is $130.33 million against the
appraisal estimate of $91.96 million. The comparison of appraisal estimate
and actual costs is detailed in Annexes 4 and 5 and summarized below (in
US$ million):

3.17      The total project cost exceeded the appraisal forecast by about
US$38 million equivalent (or 42%).  The major cost overrun was on the local
peso portion of the project cost, a total of P 261.92 million (US$32.5 nil-
lion equivalent), representing 124% of the appraisal estimate of P 212.10
million (US$30.96 million equivalent).



-8-
3.18      A local cost overrun of P 97.85 million (US$11.9 million) in the
construction of Pantabangan Hydropower Plant was due to increased civil
works, including those works which had not been well defined in the prelim-
inary design, and those in connection with heavy rains and floods in
December 1974 which caused a major landslide at the right abutment of the
Masiway re-regulation dam.
3.19      Out of the local cost overrun of P 168.19 million (US$21.38 mil-
"ion equivalent) in the construction of the transmission system, P 100
million (60%) represents the difference between the appraisal estimate and
the original contract costs as awarded to the various contractors; of this,
approximately half can be directly related to the project slippage,
resulting in works being carried out at higher prices than anticipated at
appraisal. A further 35% represents change orders and extra works required
to complete and protect the various subprojects; and 15% represents the
price adjustments due to escalation.
3.20      A foreign cost overrun of $6.0 million in the procurement of
transmission lines equipment and materials is attributed to quantities being
greater than anticipated from the rough designs used for appraisal, and to
certain prices and price adjustment due to escalation. This cost overrun
represents 9.8% of the total foreign cost of the project. It was financed
out of commercial funding arranged by NPC.
3.21      Considering that the actual contract implementation was prolonged
to about 8 vears vs. 3 years, the contemplated contingency could not cover
the additional costs of the prolonged project. The additional local costs
were financed out of NPC's own cash flow and equity capital subscription by
GOP. Despite the cost-overrun, interest during construction was slightly
less than estimated at appraisal, mainly as a result of a lower-than-
expected debt component in the financing plan (para. 4.07)
Disbursements
3.22      Because of project delays, the Bank extended the closing date from
December 31, 1978, to June 30, 1981 and then to March 31, 1982. The final
payment from the loan was made on March 9, 1982, more than three years
behind appraisal schedule.  The loan account was closed on July 1, 1982 with
the cancellation of a balance then remaining of $507,971.41. The total
disbursed was $60,492,028.59. A summary of estimated and actual loan
disbursements is shown in Annex 6.
Operating Performance
3.23      From April 1977-82, the Pantabangan power plant has contributed
electric power on average about 239 GWh annually to Luzon grid, less than
the expected 293 GWh due to three consecutive dry years after commencing of



the power plant. The installed capacity is fully utilized for peaking.
Operation of the plant has been satisfactory.
3.24      The operation of the transmission subprojects is also
satisfactory.

IV. rINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
4.01      Summarized financial results /1 of NPC during the period of
project construction (1974-82) appear at Annex 7 through 9, together with
the appraisal forecasts, which were prepared for the period 1974-80.
4.02      NPC consistently earned a positive net income throughout the
period, as anticipated at appraisal. However, the actual results differed
substantially from the forecasts as a result chiefly of three factors:
(a)  the escalation of fuel costs;
(b)  the acquisition of MERALCO's generating facilities in 1977-79; and
(c)  the rate of growth of NPC's expansion program and the associated
financing requirements.
4.03      Fuel Costs.  The appraisal assumptions on general cost inflation
(about 9% p.a.) were close to the actual, which averaged 10% over the
period. But the rapid rise in international fuel prices and the deprecia-
tion of the peso, which for most of the period st ,d about 10% below the
assumed rate of P 6.85 = $1, soon raised NPC's cect of generation well
above forecast levels. By 1977, it was 6.5 centavos/kWh sold compared to
2.5 forecast, and by 1980, after assimilation of the ex-MERALCO plants into
the system, it had reached 24 centavos/kWh compared to 2.8 forecast. NPC
was able to recover these additional costs through its fuel cost adjustment
(FCA) mechanism; as a result, the average revenue per kWh sold reached
34 centavos in 1980 compared with 9 centavos forecast.
4.04      MERALCO.  The significance for NPC of the acquisition of MEKALCO's
generating facilities is described in para. 5.02. Financially, the acquisi-
tion increased NPC's sales and costs to such an extent that the forecasts
for those years are no longer comparable.
4.05      Expansion Program.  Acceleration of NPC's expansion plans as a
result of GOP's drive for imported fuel substitution, as weli as normal load
growth (para. 5.03), raised capital expenditures increasingly higher than
appraisal expectations from 1976 onwards; by 1980 at P 4.5 billion, they
were running over seven times appraisal forecast.
/t NPC changed its financial year-end from June 30 to December 31, in
1976. Appraisal estimates are based on the former; actual results for
individual years are as published. Aggregates for the construction
period have been adjusted to a December 31 basis throughout.



- 11 -
Rate of Return
4.06      Although NPC was able to recover its increased fuel costs through
FCA (para. 4.03), its basic rate schedule was not moved along fast enough to
keep pace with the growth of its other costs and provide the 8% rate of
return covenanted with the Bank. Actual annual rates of return ranged
between 3.9% and 7.7% during the period of project construction. The rate
base was revalued each fourth year as agreed with the Bank, and in the
intermediate years was updated by reference to a composite construction cost
index compiled by NPC for the purpose.
Financing
4.07      The acceleration of the expansion program called for the mobiliza-
cion of much larger amounts of finance than envisioned ar appraisal.
Borrowing was over four times greater than forecast in the period through
1980, and in some cases involved substantially harder terms, To mitigate
the overall cost of funds to NPC, GOP has made annual subscriptions to NP?C's
equity capital since 1975 in the ratio of approximately 1:2 to aggregate
borrowings, which had not been anticipated at appraisal. As a result, NPC's
capitalization at the end of 1980 was 54:46 debt:capital, compared with
70:30 forecast. The sources and uses of funds for the period of construc-
tion was as follows:
1975-80                         1975-82

Financial Covenants
4.08      NPC's compliance with the main undertakings in the loan agreement
is summarized in Annex 12.  It has been noted (para. 4.03) that UPC was not
able to reach the covenanted rate of return of 8%. With operating casb flow
thus constrained and faced with a rapidly rising burden of debt service as a
result of accelerated borrowing (para. 4.07), NPC was also urnable in most
years to achieve the covenanted 1.3-times coverage of debt service.
However, receivables, which had escalated rapidly in 1975/76, were brought
under control in 1977 and reduced below the covenanted level of 3 mornts'
billing in 1978. NPC has consistently provided the Bank with audited
financial statements in a timely manner.



- 13 -
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOP1ENT
5.01      As noted earl.er (para. 4.02), the appraisal mission did not anti-
cipate NPC's rate of growth during the project construction period. Some
indicators of the latter are given below:
1974      1982       Increase
Energy generation (GWh)                           2,650      17,413         6.5x
Energy sales (GWh)                                2,360      16,000         6.8x
Installed capacity (NW, year-end)                   501       4,324         8.6x
Capacity under construction (MW, year-end)          225       2,210         9.gx
Employees                                         4,060      11,980         3.Ox
5.02      Early in the construction period of the project, NPC began to
assume the responsibilities assigned to it by Presidential Decree No. 40 of
1972, including in particular planning and operating all power generation
facilities throughout the Philippines. A major step in this process was the
takeover from MERALCO of the latter's generating plants serving the Metro
Manila area. This takeover - implemented in stages over 1977-79 - trebled
NPC's generating capacity and energy sales, and required the assimilation of
about 1,000 ex-MERALCO personnel into 1NPC's organization.
5.03      During the same period, the sudden escalation of fuel oil prices
prompted an amnbitious and urgent GOP program of fuel oiL substitution in
electric power generation, and NPC commissioned the first geothermal power
plants (Tiwi and Mak Ban) in the Philippines in 1979, as well as initiating
exploitation of other geothermal fields, commencing construction of the
first nuclear povier plant (PN?P) and continuing developrent of hydropower
resources, particularly in Mindanao.
5.04      These activities, combined with the normal system growth attribu-
table to increasing energy use and new connections and with the requirements
of the expanding rural electrification program, placed heavy demands on
NPC's organizatiou.l capability. Since their timing was uncertain when the
Sixth Power project was appraised - and in the case of the consequences of
the oil price explosion, could hardly have been foreseen - the project
itself contained no components specifically designed to address then.  How-
ever, the Seventh Power project (loan 1460-PH) contained a number of techni-
cal assistance components designed to assist corporate development, and with



- 14 -
these inputs and under the direction of a strong top management team, NPC
gained in strength throughout the period. The rapid expansion of the system
- especially in Luzon - provoked some faltering in service standards towards
the end of the seventies, but this has now been largely overcome. Apart
from this, NPC vas able to sustain its expansiorn without deterioration in
efficiencv, as evidenced by the following indicators:
1974                 1982
System losses (%)                                       10.9                   8.1
Energy generation per employee (kWh)                652,000              1,454,000
Installed capacity per employee (kW)                    123                    361

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Load Growth
6.01      From the commnissioning of the Pantabangan power station (1977)
through the end of the appraisal forecast period (1980), both energy sales
and peak demand on the Luson grid grew rather more slowly than anticipated
(Annex 10). Major influences were the effect of fuel costs in raising the
average price per kWh much higher than expected (para.. 4n03), and the impact
of several consecutive years of drought on the supply capability of the
hydro plants (including Pantabangan itself, para. 3.23). Nevertheless,
during the same perlod NPC maintained its construction of new generating
capacity exactly on program; one of the consequences of the resultant
enhanced reserve capacity wEs a gradual improvement in the reliability of
supply on the Luzon grid.
Least-Cost Solution: Pantabangan
6.02      The appraisal mission compared the efficiency of the Pantabangan
station in providing peak power to the Luzon grid with the alternative
available in a similar time frame, a gas turbine plant of equivalent size.
It found the Pantabangan project to be more economical at discount rates up
to 35%. The comparison has been recalculated at 1982 prices projected to
the end of the 50-year estimated life of the hydropower plant, and the
choice of Pantabangan as the least-cost solution is confirmed. The project
is more economical even at its current reduced level of operation (para.
3.23) at discount rates up to 37%; at the full level of operation envisioned
at appraisal, the eutoff rate rises to 41%.
Rate of Return: Pantabangan
6.03      The appraisal report measured Pantabangan's economic benefits by
reference to the fuel savings that would be secured by substituting power
generation by existing thermal stations, disregarding Pantabangan's capa-
bility for pealcing power and its superiority over gas turbine generation for
that purpose. On this relatively conser-vati.ve basis a rate of return of 16%
was forecast for the project. Recalculated on the same methodology at 1982
prices, the rate of return is 16% at the current level of operation and
would be 20% at full operation. Cost and benefit data are at Annex 11.
Transmission Component
6.04      The Appraisal Report did not attempt to calculate a rate of return
on the transmission facilities "due to the difficulties in quantifying
economic and social benefits and allocating meaningful incremental revenues
to the facilities."  However, it may be noted that the Philippines' rural
electrification program for the years 1979-82, (which about half of the
transmission component was designed to serve) has recently been reevaluated

in the context of the completion report on the First Rural Electrification
project (Loan 1547-PH), and yields a rate of return of about 16% after
taking into account the full economic costs of bulk power generated and
transmitted by NPC.
6.05      The transmission facilities included in the project, particularly
the extension of the 141 kn, 230 kV transmission line backbone to the Bicol
region, insured the transmission of 200 MW generated power from the Tiwi
Geothermal Power Plant to Metro Manila. As of 1982, the installed capacity
of the Tiwi Geothermal Plant was 4 units of 55 MW each, augmenting the
Makban Geothermal Plants in Los Banos, Laguna, of a similar capacity. The
completion of the Sapang Palay-Dolores 230 kV transmission line finally
established a strong link between the North and South Luzon power systems of
NPC. On the other hand, the extension of 69 kV transmission lines and
installation of load-end substations extended the electricity supply to
about 130 towns covered by the newly organized Rural Electric Cooperatives,
provided industrial power to the EBxport Processing Zone Authority at Bataan
and expanded various stubstations in terms of transformer capacities and
9witching facilities for reliability and flexibility of system operations.
These additional transmission facilities enabled Luzon Grid, excluding the
Meralco franchise area, to maintain a 10.7% annual growth rate in the sale
of electric energy from 1977-80.

VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01      The Pantabangan hydropower plant was constructed efficiently under
the supervision of NIA, and commissioned and turned over to NPC for operation
on schedule in 1977. The local currency cost overrun on the project is
attributable in large measure to the effects of severe weather at an early
stage of project construction.
7.02      The implementation of the rest of the project was not so successful.
The transmission component was completed with its last subproject only in
December 1982, five years late, and at a cost nearly double the appraisal
estimate.
7.03      Design proceeded at a slow pace, and extensive rerouting of the
subprojects and redesign of structures evidenced a lack of adequate planning.
In order to improve the preparation of future projects, it is recommended that
organization for the planning and design works be reviewed and functional
authority and responsibility be redefined. The following measures are also
recommended:
(a) early negotiations of rights-of-way;
(b)  thorough physical (subsoil) studies during detailed engineering; and
(c) early preparation of letters of credit for procurement of foreign
supplies.
7.04      Project implementation was  also affected by some of the delays in
the procurement process which contributed to the late conpletion of the Fifth
Power Project (Loan 809-PH and Credit 296-PH). These included factors beyond
NIPC's control; in particular, government regulations in force at that time
required all publicly bid or negotiated contracts with values exceeding
P 2 million (about $250,000) to be submitted to the UEDA Contracts Review
Committee for review and subsequent endorsement and approval by the President
- frequently a time-consuming process./I  UPC itself was slow in dealing with
procurement.  Revised GOP procedures introduced between 1978 and 1982 will
alleviate causes of delay external to NPC.
7.05      Although not specifically the subject of any components in this
project, NPC's organizational growth was rapid and sound during the project
construction period. Financially, problems began to emerge toward the elnd
of the 1970s as a result of the accelerated pace of the construction program
at a time when basic electric rates were being advanced only slowly. NPC
/1 NEDA have commented that in according to their records, the Contracts
Review Committee was not a "significant cause of delay" (Annex 13, pg. 6).

never attained the 8% rate of return on assets employed envisioned at
appraisal and covenanted in the loan documents, and by the early 1980s cash
flow was reduced to a point where debt service (inflated by high interest
rates and the depreciating peso) had become a matter of concern. In 1982
and again in 1983 NPC's basic rates were increased, and at the same time
recession in the Philippines slowed the capital program. Although NPC's
financial condition is still difficult these measures have stabilized the
situation. The Bank continues to work with NPC on this and other aspects of
its development through the ongoing Seventh Power Project (Loan 1460-PH) and
the second Structural adjustment Loan.

Mr. Shiv S. Kapur
Director, Operations Evaluation Dept.

1818 H Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C., U.S.A. 20433
RE: Project Completion Report on the Philippines: Sixth Power Project
(Loan 1034-PH)
Dear Mr. Kapur:
We thank you for sending us for comment a copy of the draft Project Com-
pletion Report on the Philippines: Sixth Power Loan Project (Loan 1034-
PH). We have reviewed the document and following are our comments.
Project Components
From para. 2.01 of the report, it is understood that the Sixth IBRD Power
Loan financed the power generation component of the multi-purpose Upper
Pampanga River Project (UPRP) whose irrigation compoaent and the study
for the power phase were financed earlier under IBRD Loan No. 637-PH
(1969). In NIA's Project Completion Report of the UPRP (June 30, 1977),
the power phase was included among the completed physical components of
the project (Loan 673-PH), however, without mentioning that it was
separately funded by another loan (1034-PH). This should be clarified
in the Bank's report.
Project Changes
Comparison of actual with original (planned) lengths of transmission lines
and number of substations show that actual length of transmission lines
is shorter in total and there are less 69 MVA substations installed          [para. 2.05
(para. 205). Inasmuch as the original objectives to meet demands were not
affected, and considering that system losses were even reduced to 8.1%,
the changes might indicate that better, more economical routing of lines
and location of substations resulted in the changes.

Delays in Project Implementation
The report identified the various factors that caused the delay in
implementation, particularly in the transmission cotaponent. On the
basis of past experiences with other pover projects in the Phi2.ippines,
the same reasons have been cited. Regarding delays in delivery of
foreign supplies, however, specific reasons should be identified.
As have been recommended in the past, we likewise recommend the foLlowing,
where applicable, to avoid similar delays in the future:
(i) early negotiations of ROW;
(ii)  thorough physical (sub-soil) studies                   (paras. 3.03
during detailed engineering; and                        and 7.031
(iii)  early preparation of letters of credit
for procurement of foreign suppLies.
Project Cost
Considering the substantial delay and extension of implementation schedule
which was a major reason for the large cost overrun, we noted that
Interest during construction for foreign cost counterpart did mot increase
while interest on local cost counterpart even decreased reLative to apprai-
sal estimates.  It is more reasonable to expect increases in interest    [paTa. 3.211
charges.
We also noted that actual foreign exchange cost e2ceeded appraisal estimate
(para. 3.20) although a balance of US$ 507,97L remained as of loan cLosing.
We wish to clarify whether any provision in or amendment to the loan was
made to cover the excess foreign exchange cost.                               (paTa. 3.20]
Fi nancial Performance
An analysis of growth of revenue rates vis-a-vis costs (capital and 0 & M4)
per kilowatt-hour might be added to the financial assessment of 1NPC.
Project Justification
(a) Rate of Return
The rate of return for Pantabangan power was based on fuel savings by
substitution of hydropower to thermal power. Presently, there is an
on-going project to rehabilitate existing thermal plants. If such is the
case, Pantabangan's justification would be linited to its peaking capa-
bility (para. 6.03).

ANNEX 1.3
Page 6 of 6
(b) Transmission Component
While we agree that it is quite diffieuLt to estimate economic benefits
for transmission lines alone, they shouLd also be subjected to cost-
benefit analysis. The costs of transmission lines in the past have been
so large as to bring down a project's economic worth substantially.    [para. 6.04]
Perhaps, benefits could be quantified in temns of the extent to which
the transmission lines have actually connected potential users and
increased the market for electricity measured by the additional revenues
generated.
Conclusions
Para. 7.03 of the PCR has pointed out that delay in implementation was
partly due to NPC's organization and functional distribution with respect
to planning and design. Accordingly, the Report recommends "that organi-
zation for the planning and design works be reviewed and functional autho-
rity and responsibility be redefined". We think that this matter should
be taken up under section III (Project Implemnentation, and Cost) if the  [paras 3.05
Bank considers It to be a major delay factor, rather than appearing only and 7.03]
at the Conclusion.
Also regarding implementation delays, para. 7.04 mentions in particular
that among the delay factors in the procurement process is the review of
contracts involving amounts exceeding B2 million by the NEDA Contract
Review Committee. We wish to inform you that per the Committee's records,
the NPC contracts related to the subject project were acted upon within
15 working days. Relative to the delays in delivery of supply, this
could not be considered a significant cause for the total delay.           [para. 7.04]
We hope that our comments will be helpful in the finalization of the Pro-
ject Completion Report.

VICENTE B. VALDEP  AS
