APPRAISAL OF THE SIXTH POWER PROJECT
SUMKARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers an appraisal of a project consisting of a
hydroelectric generating installation of 10) MW at Pantabangan as an exten-
sion to the Upper Pampanga River Irrigation scheme, additions to the National
Power Corporation (NPC)'s transmission grid on Luzon, and technical studies
by consultants. The estimated total cost of the Project is US$92 million.
A Bank loan of US$61 million equivalent including interest on the Bank loan
during construction of US$5 million is proposed to meet the foreign cost of
the Project.
ii.       NPC has received five loans and one IDA credit from the Bank Group
amounting to US$99.3 million equivalent. The project being financed by
the most recent loan 809-PH and Credit 296-PH will be completed about
April 1976.
iii.      The Government's policy of total electrification, declared
by Presidential Decree No. 40 of November 1972, aims at forming island
grids, integrating power generating facilities and consolidating the elec-
tric distribution franchise system. NPC was made responsible for future
development of generating plants and transmission systems. The National
Electrification Administration (NEA) was made responsible for reorganizing
and expanding the distribution sector. The Power Development Council will
coordinate the planning and implementation of electrification projects.
This provides a good basis for sector development.
iv.       The recent price of oil and uncertainties of its future supply
have given priority to the development of indigenous hydroelectric and
geothermal energy sources and nuclear power. The initial findings of
geothermal explorations are encouraging and NPC has obtained a loan from
Italy to finance construction of its first geothermal power plant by 1979.
NPC has also initiated detailed site investigations and preliminary design
for the first nuclear plant to be commissioned in 1984.
v.        Demand for electricity in the Philippines is concentrated in the
island of Luzon, especially in the Greater Manila area where it is increasing
steadily. The Pantabangan project will provide ideal peaking capacity by
utilizing irrigation water releases during the dry season. It is the least
cost solution for discount rates up to 35%. In the provincial area reliable
supplies of electricity are available only in large cities and towns; the
rest of the people either have supply on a limited and very costly basis or
none at all. The proposed transmission project will extend power supply to
rural areas by connecting about 130 towns and 60 large consumers including



- ii -
pumped irrigation projects. Thus, the project would make a substantial con-
tribution towards implementing the national policy of total electrification.
vi.       Total investment equivalent to about US$463 million is planned
by NPC in FY 1975-78, to be financed from internally generated funds (15%),
borrowings (84%) and by equity contribution (1%). NPC would require US$286
million in foreign currency. It has firm coumitments of US$96 million, with
an additional US$61 million by the loan now proposed. A gap of US$129 mil-
lion remains in respect of which the Government has applied to the Overseas
Economic Corporation Fund (OECF) of Japan for US$16 million, t;ie Asian Devel-
opment Bank (ADB) for $24 million, and anticipates assistance from the ADB,
the World Bank Group, and others for the balance. NPC will raise its domestic
capital through retained earnings, the sale of bonds, and from funds available
through Commodity Loans.
vii.      NPC was expected to.earn a minimum rate of return of 8% on its
net fixed assets in operation in FY 1974 but a return of 6.2% is now forecast
due to slowness in increasing tariffs and to salary and wage increases and
to continuing inflation during the year. NPC has now approved revised
tariffs to be effective from July, 1974 which should ensure the required
return of not less than 8% in F! 1975.
viii.     NPC's financial perforu)ance in the past was poor, but it has
improved considerably since the revision of its charter in 1971, by con-
tinued implementation of recoumendations made by management consultants
employed as a result of Loan 491-PH, tariff increases, exemption from in-
come taxes, realty taxes, duties and other charges, a rate base maintained
at current values, and a much Improved financial reporting system.
ix.       The Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$61 million equivalent,
with a term of 25 years, including 4 years of grace on amortization.

APPRAISAL OF THE SIXTH POWER PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers the appraisal of a project consisting of a
100 MW hydroelectric plant at Pantabangan, further expansion of the trans-
mission system in Luzon, and the services of engineering consultants to
undertake engineering studies of the Chico hydroelectric development and a
dispatching center. The Project would be completed by December 1977. The
National Power Corporation (NPC) supported by the Government has requested
a loan equivalent to the foreign c-ost of the Project, estimated at US$61
million equivalent. The Project'i total cost is estimated at US$92 million.
The borrower would be the NPC, a government-owned corporation established in
1936.
1.02      The Bank Group has made five loans to NPC and one IDA credit to
the Government for power projects, amounting to US$99.3 million, net of
cancellations, as follows:
Net Amount

Total:                 $99.3
1.03      The projects undertaken through the first four loans have been
completed and are in satisfactory operation.  Following initial delay in
project preparation for the Bataan No. 2 unit and transmission lines, im-
plementation is now proceeding satisfactorily. Commissioning is presently
expected in April 1976, about 10 months behind the original schedule.
1.04      The institutional objectives of Loan 809-PH and Credit 296-PH are
being achieved. The consultants' feasibility studies of possible hydro-
electric schemes and of the pumped storage scheme at Kalayaan have been



- 2 -
completed; fixed assets have been revalued; a national policy has been in-
troduced for coordinating the development of the power sector and the NPC
Charter has been further revised. NPC now has the necessary structure and
powers for sound and efficient public utility operation. It achieved the
6% rate of return stipulated in Loan 809-PH for FY 1973, with a forecast
6.2% return in FY 1974 compared to 8% required by the Agreement.
1.05      This report was prepared by Messrs. R. Maeda and S. S. Scales who
visited the Philippines in November/December 1973 to appraise the project.
II. THE ECONOMY
2.01      The Republic of the Philippines c9nsists of over 7100 islands,
all of which lie within the tropics in the Western Pacific. Only 154 of
the islands have a land area in excess of 13 square kilometers. The largest
eleven account for 95% of the total land area of 184,000 square kilometers.
The Philippine archipelago is divided into three regions as are NPC's opera-
tions, Luzon in the north, the central islands known as the Visayas, and
Mindanao (including Sulu islands) in the south. All the regions lie within
the typhoon belt.
2.02      The population is approximately 40 million, over one half of which
live on Luzon, over 4 million being concentrated in the Greater Manila area.
About 25% of the population live in the Visayas, and the remainder in the
Mindanao region. The population is growing at the rate of 3.1% a year.
2.03      In the three years 1970-1972 the performance of the economy was
disappointing with a growth of only 5% a year in GNP. The Government's
policy of monetary and fiscal restraint had improved the maturity autructure
of external public debt, but the country had suffered considerable disruption
of its agricultural output which had retarded food production, a deteriora-
tion in external trade, and rapid inflation. The real gross national income
per capita in 1971 and 1972 remained at about US$240.
2.04      The situation changed favorably in 1973.  The recently increased
world prices of commodities exported by the Philippines such as sugar,
lumber, copper and gold contributed to the higher economic growth and in-
creased foreign exchange reserves.
2.05      The recent economic mission is assessing the impact of higher
oil prices on the Philippine economy. Preliminary analysis indicates the
continuing favorable situation in 1974 with an expected surplus of US$250
million in overall balance of payment, which would increase international
reserves to about US$1.1 billion, the equivalent of about three and half
months' imports. In 1975, sustaining high prices of exports will likely
offset the increased cost of fuel imports, resulting in only a small deficit
in overall balance of payment.

III. IrE POWER SECTOR
3.01      Prior to measures introduced in November 1972 to improve the opera-
tion of the power sector, as discussed in the following paragraph, sector
development lacked a cohesive plaa and was poorly coordinated, even between
NPC and Manila Electric Company (AECO), the largest entities. Loan 809-PH
in early 1972, focused on the need for more effective coordination of planning
of power development and implementation among power suppliers, and the Govern-
ment had undertaken to prepare proposals for improving the situation by
December 31, 1972.
3.02      On November 7,' 1972, Presidential Decree No. 40 (Annex 1) directed
that attainment of a national policy objective of total electrification
(Annex 2) involving industrial development, dispersal of industry, and rural
electrification should be achieved by establishing island grids, integrating
power generating systems, and consolidating electric distribution franchise
systems. This was a major change in sector policy. NPC was made responsible
for the construction of national grids and the development of all future
generation supplying the grids and ultimately for owning and operating all
generating facilities.   This implies that existing generating facilities of
MECO, representing two-thirds of the total capacity in the country, will be
transferred to NPC.   However, the terms and timing of the transfer remain
to be decided. The distribution of electric power will be undertaken by
electric cooperatives, and municipal and private electric utilities. The
National Electrification Administration (NEL.) was made responsible (Annex 3)
for reorganizing the distribution sector and implementing rural electrification.
The Power Development Council 1/ was made responsible for the preparation of
an effective integrated plan of electrification and power development and to
coordinate all activities and operations in its implementation. The Decree
is more comprehensive and far reaching than had been contemplated by the
covenant in the 809-PH Guarantee Agreement.
Energy Resources
3.03      The country is not rich in energy resources.  Coal deposits are
limited in amount and belong to a geologically young variety with low
heating values. The hydroelectric potential is estimated at 3,600 MW, two-
thirds in Luzon and one-third in Mindanao; 16% of it has already been dev-
eloped. Oil and gas explorations are in progress in Cebu and off-shore in
Palawan. Some gas reserves have been found, but these are insignificant
for the electric power sector. More than 90% of total energy consumption
and about 80% of the electric generation are presently dependent on imported
oil. Its price and the uncertainties of future supply have accelerated NPC's
and Government's plans for development of indigenous geothermal energy and
1/   A Government agency formed in 1970 to carry out research and coordinate
the development of the power sector, and which reports to the Office of
the President.



nuclear power. The initial findings of geothermal explorations at Tiwi,
Southern Luzon, are encouraging. High pressure steam sufficient to produce
20 MW of electric power has been found and the capacity of the field is
estimated at several hundred megawatts. NPC has entered into a contract
with Philippine Geothermal, Inc., subsidiary of Union Oil of California for
the supply of steam uip to 250 MW. Exploration of another geothermal field
started on the island of Leyte recently. A feasibility study for nuclear
power has been completed by Electrowatt of Zurich for the International Atomdc
Energy Agency, and NPC has engaged consultants for the detailed site investi-
gations and preliminary design. The first 600 MW unit is likely to be in
operation by 1984.
Power Supply
3.04      Electricity supply is provided by more than 400 utilities.  One
quarter are public, the largest by far being NPC. The rest are privately
owned, dominated by MECO. NPC accounts for about 26% of total generation
and MECO for 66%; the remaining 8% being provided by the self-generating
small utilities. NPC's generation is primarily from hydroelectric resources;
MECO depends almost entirely on oil-fired thermal generation. In addition,
some industries have captive plants, totalling about 18% of utility capacity.
3.05      MECO serves the greater Manila area, the center of the country's
industrial and commercial activities. Industrial and commercial load re-
present 41% and 24% of MEC0's total sales, respectively.  MECO's fixed serv-
ice area which has been well served for years, and the industrial dispersal
policy of the Government combined to stabilize load growth to a moderate 8%
annually during the 5 years 1967-72. As this growth rate is not likely to
change significantly (para 6.01), the extent of MECO's participation in the
sector will gradually decline. NPC, as a bulk supplier of electricity to
small utilities, serves 177 electric utilities and 104 non-utility customers
spread over about half of Luzon, in small areas of Mindanao and in the
Visayas islands. NPC's provincial demands in Luzon have been growing at an
average annual rate of 15% during the past 5 years, reflecting the Govern-
ment's policy of total electrification.
3.06      However, total electrification has a long way to go.  Although
about 30% of the total population enjoy the benefits of electricity, most
of them live in urban areas. In rural areas small private and municipal
utilities provide limited service but reliable supplies are available only
in large cities and towns where utilities are connected with the main grids.
The rest of the utilities generate power on a 6-10 hour daily basis from
small diesel units averaging in capacity less than 500 kW; services are
substandard. Even in Luzon, the most developed region, 242 towns and villages
out of a total of 636 have no power supply at all. NEA has already initiated
plans for their electrification (para 3.11).
Development Program
3.07      NPC has prepared a long-range generation expansion program for the
combined NPC-MECO Luzon grid based on recommendations by its consultants,



-5-
International Engineering Co. (IECO) of San Francisco. Projects included
in the program for early commissioning are listed below:

8.  Chico II 1-4    240        hydro            NPC               1981
Total installed capacity in the Luzon grid will increase by 70% from 1,896 MW
in 1973 to 3,186 MW in 1980. Existing facilities of the Luzon grid are shown
in Annexes 4-5.
The program has three distinctive aspects:
(a) NPC will be responsible for all the future generation
expansion after Malaya 2 as stipulated by Presidential
Decree No. 40 (para 3.02);
(b)  indigenous resources of hydro and geothermal energy
will be utilized instead of conventional oil-fired
steam plants (para 3.03); and
(c)  emphasis is placed on the development of peaking capacity
required in late 1970's when about 84% of total capacity
will consist of base-load thermal plants.
The future generation development policy is to provide the base load energy
from geothermal and nuclear sources, and peaking capacity from pondage hydro
and pumped storage schemes. However, oil-fired generation might have to
replace Tiwi geothermal should sufficient steam not be available.
3.08      In response to the energy crisis, the Government and NPC recently
revised the above investment program in order to further accelerate hydro,
geothermal and nuclear power development and reduce dependence on oil-fired
thermal plant. This revised program is now being reconsidered by NPC and the
Government since it appears too ambitious both in terms of executing a large
number of additional projects and in terms of finding foreign and domestic
financing for them.



- 6 -
3.09      NPC and MECO have been operating essentially independently with
only seasonal and emergency exchange of energy between the two systems.
Joint operation would not only yield technical and economic advantages but
will become inescapable in the future when MECO becomes dependent on NPC
for its power supply. A task force consisting of NPC and MECO personnel
and a professor from the University of the Philippines has been studying the
technical and economic aspects of 'combined operation' of the two systems.
The results of the study are to be reviewed by consultants proposed to be
retained for the preparation of a feasibility study for a load dispatching
center (para 5.05).
3.10      In Mindanao, NPC relies entirely on the hydroelectric development
of the Agus river. The installed capacity is presently 150 MW at the Agus
VI plant. NPC is planning to triple its generating capacity by 1978 to meet
growing industrial demands by adding a 5th unit of 50 MW to Agus VI and by
developing Agus II (180 MW) and Agus VII (60 MW).  The Agus river can be
further developed to a maximum capacity of about 900 MW, which would be
sufficient to cover demands expected by the early 1980's. In the Visayas
region NPC has only two small hydropower plants (2 MW) and demand is sup-
pressed. A power development study has been carried out and NPC plans to
install 5 x 10 MW diesel units by 1977 and a 50 MW coal-fired steam plant
in 1978 on the island of Cebu.
National Electrification Administration
3.11      NEA was empowered by Letter of Instruction No. 38 (Annex 3) to
implement Presidential Decree No. 40, and was given certain powers, duties,
and functions to attain total electrification; to set up cooperatives for
the distribution of power; and to determine which privately-owned public
utilities should be permitted to remain in operation. NEA's organization
was strengthened and made more flexible by Presidential Decree No. 269 dated
August 6, 1973 (called the NEA Decree) which converted it into a corporation,
wholly owned and controlled by the Government, having borrowing authority
and corporate powers. By February, 1974, 47 cooperatives had already been
registered and 18 of them had taken ovet franchises and are supplying
electricity to consumers in approximately 80 towns and villages.
Manila Electric Company
3.12      Although NPC has been given responsibility for the construction of
all new plant additions to meet the increase in power demand, MECO will
continue for the present to complete Malaya 1 (310 MW) to be commissioned
in January 1975, and Malaya 2 (330 MW) to be completed by January 1978.
3.13      MECO was purchased in 1962 by the Filipino owned Meralco Securities
Corporation from the General Public Utilities Corporation of New York and
now generates about 66% of all electric energy in the country, almost en-
tirely from oil-fired plant. It was and is well-managed and until about
1970 profitably operated. Foreign capital was raised by the sale of bonds
abroad, but devaluation of the peso in 1970 combined with inability to se-
cure approval for tariff actions to maintain what had been the allowable
return of 12% on net fixed assets seriously upset its cash flow. A severe
liquidity problem ensued.



- 7 -
3.14      The Meralco Securities Corporation has recently been divested of
MECO in connection with Government's agreement to guarantee repayment of
MECO's debt. It is also the Government's objective that MECO should regain
its financial viability and it has recently approved substantial tariff
increases toward this end.
IV. THE BORROWER
4.01      Created originally as a nonstock public corporation in 1936, NPC
was converted into a stock corporation in 1960. Presidential Decree No. 380
of January 22, 1974 raised the authorized stock from 1 300 million, fully
subscribed by the Government, to f 2,000 million. The life of the corpora-
tion, due to expire on January 4, 1976, was extended by 50 years.
Organization and Management
4.02      NPC's past management suffered from poor financial and operating
information and inadequate authority. The reorganization by consultants of
managerial duties, the overhaul of accounting and financial functions, on-
the-spot training of personnel implementing the revised systems and proce-
dures, and the revision of its charter have provided NPC the necessary base
for sound and efficient public utility operation. Although more time is re-
quired to demonstrate fully the effect of the reorganization, considerable
improvement is already evident.
4.03      NPC's corporate powers are vested in a Board of seven members
including the General Manager who is ex-officio Vice Chairman. The Chairman
and the five directors are appointed by the President of the Philippines
with the consent of the Commission on Appointments. The five directors re-
present Luzon, Mindanao, Visayas, labor, and the business sector, respectively,
and each is required to possess one or more of the following qualifications:
a licensed professional of recognized competence in engineering, in business
management and finance, or in law, or to be a recognized labor leader. Re-
gional representatives must be residents of the regions they represent.
Amendment to the NPC Charter (Republic Act No. 6395)
4.04      Amendments to the NPC Charter in September, 1971 improve rate-
making procedures by exempting NPC rate increases from lower court injunc-
tions which had in the past been the major cause of delay in implementing
such increases. The amendments also grant NPC exemption from all taxes,
including income and other taxes, reflecting the Government's determination
to help it overcome its financial difficulties.
4.05      NPC's Charter was again amended by Presidential Decree No. 380 in
January 1974. The following are the main changes:
(a) NPC was placed under the direct supervision of the
Office of the President, with the Solicitor General
having supervision of the Corporation's court cases.



- 8 -
(b) All industrial disputes of the Corporation will be
settled by compulsory arbitration.
(c) NPC was authorized to p,rescribe a standard form of
contract for the supply of power and appropriate
rules and regulations for uniform application.
Service agreements in torce at the date of the
Decree, which required differing periods of notice
before tariff changes could be implemented, were
considered revised with immediate effect.
(d) The authorized capital stock of the Corporation
was raised to 1 2,000 million to be subscribed
by the Government.
(e) The ceiling on NPC's total peso indebtedness was
raised from 1 500 million to t 3,000 million, and
that on NPC's foreign debt from US$200 million
to US$1,000 million or equivalent in other currencies.
(f) NPC was permitted to sell bulk supplies of power to
enterprises in franchised areas without restriction
when the cost of power to the enterprises would exceed
10% of the total production cost of the goods or
commodities produced.
(g) The assessment of compensation was simplified in
respect of easements or rights of way, land purchase,
or damage to property or crops by basing it on the value
of the property claimed by an owner' s current tax
declaration.
Tariffs
4.06      NPC's tariffs are appropriate for bulk supply. They include demand
(kW) and energy (kWh) charges and, effective from July 1973, the rate sched-
ule in Luzon includes a fuel clause (paras 4.08-4.10).
4.07      To assist NPC in neeting the rate of return agreed in connection
with Loan 809-PH with minimum tariff increases, the Government has not only
exempted NPC from income tax but from other expense such as all franchise
and realty taxes; all import duties, taxes, wharfage fees on the import of
foreign goods required for its operations; taxes, duties, fees, imposts
and other charges imposed directly or indirectly by the Republic of the
Philippines, its provinces, cities, municipalities and other government
agencies, on all petroleum products used by NPC on generation, transmission,
distribution and sales of electric power. Although these exemptions
increase the numerator in the rate of return calculation, a return of only
6.2% is forecast for FY 1974 rather than the minimum 8% required.  However,
NPC has approved revised tariffs for implementation from July 1, 1974,



- 9 -
which should produce revenue adequate to achieve a rate of return of not
less than 82 in FY1975.
Fuel Clause
4.08      The fuel clause referred to in paragraph 4.06 was first proposed
by NPC during FY 1971 to enable it to pass on to the consumers any variation
in the average cost of fossil fuel above a stipulated base price. This
applies only to Luzon where the cost of fuel oil is apportioned over total
sales in calculating the surcharge per kWh payable by customers. The
following table shows the cost of fuel oil at NPC's Bataan thermal plant
and the amount of the surcharge per kWh payable by customers prior to com-
missioning of Bataan unit No. 2.
Cost of Fuel Oil Only          Average Revenue per kWh Sold

at Bataan         Schedule         Surcharge       Customers
(US$)      (US cents)       (US cents)        (US cents)        (US cents)
4.40         0.74             0.89             0.16              1.05
8.80         1.48             0.89             0.35             1.24
4.09      The November 1973 fuel oil price at the Bataan plant was US$4.40
per barrel which was included in the average price of US 1.05 cents per kWh
sold by NPC to its Luzon customers. A doubled fuel oil price would raise
the price to customers by US 0.19 cents per kWh (equivalent to an additional
18% tariff increase). This comparos with a US 1.00 cent per kWh increase
in the cost of generation by MECO which in addition to paying taxes and
duties from which NPC is exempt (para 4.07), depends upon wholly oil-fired
generating plant.
4.10      NPC has a service contract with Philippine Geothermal, Inc., sub-
sidiary of Union Oil of California for drilling operations. Payment for
geothermal steam will be at a rate which is subject to escalation according
to mutually acceptable cost indices still to be arranged, but subject to
geothermal power remaining competitive with other alternative generation
sources. NPC's fuel clause formula will require amendment, prior to the
commissioning of geothermal generation plant in 1979 at Tiwi, to cover
changes in the cost of steam.
Staff
4.11      The following table shows the number of NPC employees at the end
of FY 1969 through FY 1973:



- 10 -
Permanent       Temporary/Casual
Employee            Employee            Total
June 30, 1969             1,261                625               1,886
1970             1,219                692              1,911
1971             1,107              1,039              2,146
1972             1,135              1,336              2,471
1973            1,057               1,906              2,963
4.12      A preliminary evaluation of permanent employees made by consult-
ants in 1968 indicated substantiel surplus staff.  These have been reduced
by attrition by 16% to 1057 as of June 30, 1973.  However, NPC now faces
a shortage of permanent staff in the skilled and supervisory categories,
partly due to the establishment of regional offices, but largely due to
Presidential Decree No. 40 which accelerates the investment program. Tempo-
rary and casual employees are hired for specific work orders of limited
duration in plant, substations, surveys and investigation work, and con-
struction projects. The increase of temporary employees in FY 1973 re-
flects the increased work, particularly on hydrologic surveys and in respect
of the accelerated development program.
Audit
4.13      The Commissioner on Audit, which replaced the Auditor General of the
Philippines in January, 1973, is ex-officio'auditor of NPC. He is empowered
to appoint his representative, known as the "Auditor of the Corporation".
He also appoints staff to assist his representative and fixes their salaries.
The existing loan agreement required NPC's accounts to be audited by an in-
dependent auditor acceptable to the Bank, and the Bank has accepted the
Auditor of the Corporation.
V. THE PROJECT
Project Description
5.01      The proposed project comprises:
(a) the 100 MW Pantabangan hydropower plant (para 5.02
and Annex 6);
(b) the transmission system expansion programs in Luzon
(para 5.03 and Annex 6); and
(c) the feasibility studies of the Chico river hydropower
development and a dispatching center (paras 5.04, 5.05).
5.02      The Pantabangan hydropower plant is an addition of power gener-
ating facilities to the Upper Pampanga River Project (UPRP) presently in
the final stage of construction by the National Irrigation Administration
(NIA) with the assistance of Bank Loan 637-PH. Two units of 50 MW each will
be installed in a surface power house at the foot of the irrigation dam.



- 11 -
A re-regulation dam will be built downstream of the plant to regulate river
flow for irrigation purposes. The plant would have a firm capacity of 70
MS, with an annual energy output of 293 GWh, and would supply the Luzon grid
by a 23 km 230 kV double circuit transmission line which is also included in
the Project. Commissioning is planned for April 1977.
5.03      The transmission system eIxpansion program will continue work fi-
nanced in part by the 5th Power Prcject. The Luzon grid will be extended by
constructing 210 km of 230 kV and 535 km of 69 kV transmission lines and
33 substations with a total capacity of 1,375 MVA. Of this, 250 km of 69 kV
lines and 13 substations (75 MVA) originally included in the 5th Power Loan,
but for which bids have not been received, have been transferred to the pro-
posed project because funds remaining in the 5th Power Loan are inadequate
to cover the originally envisaged program due to sharp cost increases in
the supply and erection of transmission facilities since its appraisal in
1971 (Annex 7). The transmission expansion program would be completed by
December 1977.
5.04      A pre-feasibility study financed umder the 5th Power Project iden-
tified the Chico river as one of the better potential hydropower resources
in Luzon with a. total available capacity of 1,000 MW and 2,200 GWh. The
study included in the proposed project would advance the preliminary investi-
gations to feasibility grade level and prepare the definite design for the
Chico II site, which was given the highest priority among the four proposed
development sites in the pre-feasibility report. Pre-feasibility studies
of two tributaries of the Chico river are also included in the study.
5.05      NPC has no dispatching center and its daily operations are based
on pre-determined loading curves for each hydro plant. With the commissioning
of the second Bataan thermal unit and the need for pooled operation of the
NPC-MECO system for maximum fuel economy, it is essential for NPC to have
reliable dispatching facilities. The proposed loan would finance a study
to determine precise requirements and the design of the facilities.

5.07      The cost estimate for the Pantabangan project was prepared by
Engineering Consultant Inc. of Denver (ECI), the consultant for UPRP.
It is based on world market prices which prevailed in late 1973. The esti-
mate for the transmission system expansions was made by NPC on the basis of
the latest tenders received for similar work in the 5th Power Project. Both
estimates are considered reliable. As the project is well prepared, physical



- 13 -
contingencies of 5% should prove adequate. Various percentages of price es-
calation ranging between 7.5-18% per year haive been applied to various items
in each year during the construction period. Overall price contingency
amounts to 21% of the project cost. Considering recent trends of world-wide
inflation, the provision is reasonable.
Amount of Proposed Loan
5.08      The Project's foreign exchange component of US$56.0 million equiv-
alent represents about 66% of the total cost of US$84.5 million equivalent
before interest. This percentage is high because the Project contains very
little civil works. The proposed loan would cover the full foreign exchange
cost and the interest on the Bank loan during construction amounting to
US$5.0 million. The total amount is thus US$61.0 million.
Engineering and Construction
5.09      ECI has prepared the specification for the power phase and will
continue as the consultants during its implementation. This has been agreed
by the Bank.  During negotiations NPC confirmed that ECI would be retained
as consultants for the power phase. NPC and NIA have agreed in connection
with the implementation of the power phase that:
(a) NPC shall be the Borrower and shall be responsible to the
Bank for the satisfactory completion of the project,
including procurement;
(b) NIA shall be the implementing agency on behalf of NPC to
avoid duplication of facilities and field organization;
(c) NPC shall bear only the incremental costs of the power
phase; and
(d) NPC shall own the facilities associated with the power
phase and operate them in accordance with guidelines
set out by NIA.
The terms of the agreement are satisfactory.
5.10      NIA has been implementing UPRP satisfactorily.  Its project
organization at the site with experienced personnel, equipment and other
facilities permit it to complete the power part of the project, with
some NPC staff seconded, more expeditiously than NPC could itself.
5.11      In the interest of expediting the implementation of the Pantabangan
project, NPC has requested and the Bank has agreed that the civil works con-
tractor for UPRP undertake the 'Pantabangan civil works under the terms of a
negotiated contract. This contractor has been performing satisfactorily
for UPRP and also has experience in the construction of hydropower plants
in the country. The contract would cover the civil works for the power-
house, switchyard and the re-regulation dam. This contract would not be



- 14 -
financed by the proposed loan. However, im;orted materials and equipment
necessary for the civil works would be provided by NPC and financed by the
loan (para 5.15).
5.12      NPC has gained sufficient experience in the execution of transmis-
sion projects through the on-going 5th Power Project and plans to carry out
the engineering and the construction supervi sion of the transmission project
using its own staff. This arrangement would be satisfactory.
5.13      The transmission project includes the expansion of the Dolores
substation, the interconnecting point between NPC and MECO, but the extent
to which NPC and MECO would be responsible for the construction and operation
of the substation is not clear. The project cost estimate assumes that NPC
would be responsible for the high voltage side of the substation. A satis-
factory agreement between NPC and MECO on this matter would be the condition
of disbursement against this specific item.
5.14      For the purpose of the Chico II project feasibLlity study, NPC has
retained Lahmeyer International of Germany who carried out the pre-feasibi-
lity study of the Chico river development. The consultants are acceptable
to the Bank.  The proposed loan would finance the detailed field i3vestiga-
tion and the definite design of the project and pre-feasibility studies of
hydropower development on the Pasil and Tanudan river, tributaries of the
Chico river. The study for the dispatching center will be carried out
separately by engineering consultants yet to be selected. NPC has agreed
to retain consultants satisfactory to the Bank for this purpose.
Procurement and Disbursement
5.15      The goods and services financed by the proposed loan, including
basic materials and equipment for civil works construction to be provided
by NPC, will be procured through international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with the Bank's Guidelines. Since some of the project items could be
manufactured locally, the Loan Documents include the usual margin of pre-
ference for local manufacturers.
5.16      The preparation of bidding documents is underway for the Pantabangan
project and the items transferred from the 5th Power Project. To avoid undue
delay in the implementation of the Project, the Bank has agreed to the issu-
ance of bid invitations for these items providing no contract commitment is
made in advance of loan approval. On the basis of the present procurement
schedule it is unlikely that contracts would be ready for placing before the
loan is signed.
5.17      Disbursements would be made against the full foreign exchange costs
of equipment and services. No disbursements would be made for goods bought
prior to approval of the loan, but foreign costs of the consultants' services
incurred between December 1, 1973 and loan signing, amounting to about
US$100,000 would be financed retroactively. The estimated schedule of dis-
bursements is shown in Annex 9. Any surplus funds remaining after completion
of the Project would be cancelled, unless there were good reasons for applying
savings to related works.



- 15 -
Ecological Aspect
5.18      No ecological problem is expected to arise from the Project.  The
re-regulation daim will eliminate any effect on the downstream river flow
and the siting of it will not introduce relocation problems. Transmission
lines will mainly pass through rural and mountainous areas.
VI. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
Power Market in Luzon
6.01      Electricity consumption for the combined NPC-MECO interconnected
system has increased at the average rate of about 10% per year since FY 1967.
NPC's provincial market has grown by 15% annually, a much higher rate than
MECO's 8%, reflecting the Government's policy of bringing electricity to
rural areas. This tendency is expected to continue, although at slower
rates. Annex 10 and the attached graph (No. 8574) show the peak-demand and
energy requirements up to FY 1980 and the corresponding supply capability.
The forecist is summarized below:
Peak Demand                 Energy Requirement
FY 1972 FY 1980 Growth Rate    FY 1972 FY 1980 Growth Rate
…     14W------ --% p.a.--    ------GWh------ ---% p.a.--
NPC                    250      762     15.0          1,467   3,930      13.1
MECO                 1,002   1,827       7.8          5,427  10,200       8.2
NPC-MECO             1,214   2,512       9.5          6,894  14,130       9.4
The forecast for the NPC service area is based on a comprehensive study com-
pleted in 1973 by IECO as part of the project financed by the 5th Power Loan.
The study combined a macro-economic survey of the power market with basic
forecasts for each electric utility and specific non-utility customers within
NPC's provincial service area. The projection for the Greater Manila area
were prepared by MECO using techniques correlating macro-economic data with
projections of electricity sales. The forecast is conservative for a devel-
oping country like the Philippines, but is considered adequate as a basis
for investment and revenue projections because of the uncertain economic
outlook caused by recent increases in petroleum prices.
6.02      With the completion of Malaya No. 2 thermal unit in 1978, the com-
bined NPC-MECO system will be capable of meeting energy requirement of the
system up to 1981. However, there will be a deficit in the peak-supply ca-
pability, after provisions for adequate reserve, in the dry season of 1977
and thereafter. This reflects the system's heavy dependence on base-load
thermal generation.

Economic Justification
6.03      NPC's 4 hydropower plants, 419 MW installed, do not have sufficient
reservoir capacity for seasonal regulation. Therefore firm capacity during
the dry season, December through June, is reduced to only 302 MW, compared
to 427 MW during the wet season. Irrigation releases from the Pantabangan
reservoir, with consequent potential power generation concentrated in the dry
season, will perfectly complement the existing power system.
6.04      The only alternative peaking source which could be installed by
1977 would be gas turbine capacity. However, this would be less economical
than Pantabangan capacity for discount rates up to 35% using fuel prices
suggested in the Bank's Energy Guidelines of January 11, 1974 without further
escalation after 1980. Disregarding Pantabangan's superiority over gas tur-
bine capacity for peaking power use, its benefit derived from fuel savings by
replacing existing thermal power generation would still be greater than the
project cost for discount rates up to 16% (Annex 11).
6.05      The transmission facilities included in the Project are required
(a) to transmit power from the Tiwi geothermal plant to the Manila area and
to increase the supply capacity to MECO and (b) to meet increasing demands
of existing NPC's customers and to further extend electricity supply to
rural areas. The first function, the cost of which accounts for 57% of the
total transmission project, is essential for the development of the Tiwi
geothermal field and for supplying the Manila area in the future; the proposed
schem! has been found technically sound and economically viable by NPC and
its consultants. The second function will extend electricity supply by
1980 to about 130 towns and municipalitJes presently not connected to the
Luzon grid, of which 60 towns have limited power supply from small diesel
plants at very high prices and 70 towns have no electricity supply at all.
About 60 large consumers including 27 pumped irrigation projects will also
be connected to the NPC grid under the program. NPC has justified each rural
electrification project as the optimum scheme for the purpose. Connections
of these towns to the grid would make reliable supply available 24-hours a
day, reduce the high tariffs presently paid by consumers, assist dispersal
of industry and encourage pumped irrigation and development of agro-industry.
A rate of return on the transmission facilities has not been estimated due
to the difficulties in quantifying economic and social benefits and allocating
meaningful incremental revenues tCo the facilities.
Return on Investment
6.06      The financial return on the Pantabangan investment is 10% if the
benefits are measured by incremental revenues attributable to the project
by using tariffs prevailing before the adjustment for increased fuel costs.
With 70% tariff increase to reflect the fuel cost expected in 1978 when
Pantabangan is in full operation, the financial rate of return would be 18%
(Annex 11).

VII. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
7.01      NPC has had chronic financial troubles in the past, having had
difficulty in securing tariff increases when required and being unable to
earn the minimum return on net fixed assets agreed in successive Loan Agree-
ments with the Bank. It was also hampered by administrative restrictions,
a lack of adequate authority and management information. However, the situa-
tion has improved substantially following the revision of the NPC charter in
1971 and implementation of recommendations of management consultants employed
by NPC in connection with past loans.
Earnings Record
7.02      NPC's rate of return in FY 1969 was only 4.6% calculated on the
rate base before revaluation. The Corpbration therefore requested waiver
of the 8% minimum return required for FY 1970 by Loan 491-PH as it was pro-
posing a 73% tariff increase early in FY 1971. This increase was estimated
to raise the rate of return to over 5% on the revalued rate base after tax
(35%) which had been imposed in the previous year. Shortly afterward a 50%
devaluation of the peso further aggravated NPC's financial position and the
need for a much larger tariff increase became obvious. A special Presiden-
tial Committee was set up on May 4, 1970 to conduct a public hearing on NPC's
rate application. It held the view that tariffs should not provide funds to
finance future construction, and recommended in September 1970, a 42% in-
crease subject to NPC being exempted from income tax, otherwise a 70% in-
crease would be necessary. Tax exemption was granted. Subsequently, the
Government agreed in principle that tariffs should provide funds to finance
future construction and that NPC's tariff should be increased to achieve
the required rate of return.
7.03      Although NPC's return improved to 5.9% in FY 1972 following imple-
mentation of the revised tariffs, it was obvious that the mimimum return
could still not be achieved without further increases. It was therefore
agreed in connection with Loan 809-PH that NPC should achieve a reduced
interim return of 6% in FY 1973 on the current value of its net assets in
service and 8% in FY 1974 and subsequent years. NPC met the 6% return re-
quired in FY 1973.
Present Financial Position
7.04      NPC's financial position at June 30, 1973 is much improved; net
debt represented 48% of capitalization; current assets were over 1.7 times
current liabilities (including the current portion of long-term debt); the
operating ratio was 50%; and internal cash generation covered debt service
for the year by 1.5 times.
7.05      NPC maintains its fixed assets at current values by arranging for
review every 3-4 years by an independent appraiser, and in the interim by
updating the rate base values by a process of trending based upon a combina-
tion of the wholesale price index of imported manufactured goods in Manila
(as prepared by the Central Bank of the Philippines) and a construction



- 18 -
labor cost index developed by consultants. Gross plant in service and
accumulated depreciation were revalued as of July 1, 1972 by independent
appraisers by increasing their net aggregate value by t 262 million, or by
25Z of their pre-appraised value. The revaluation was accepted by NPC and
the book value adjusted as of June 30, 1973.
7.06      NPC's capitalization at June 30, 1973 was as follows (Annex 12):
Equity                              V Million      US$ Million       %

7.07      Equity represents 52% of capitalization.  Part of this is represented
by an appraisal surplus after revaluation of net fixed plant. During FY 1973
NPC revalued its foreign debt which had been recorded at exchange rates pre-
vailing on the dates the loans were withdrawn. Revaluing this debt increased
NPC's debt liability by F 194 million. This increase in value was adjusted
by the transfer of an equivalent sum from the revaluation reserve.
7.08      Over three-fifths of long-term debt represents foreign currency
obligations. The Bank is the main creditor. Other loans include the balance
(US$2.01 million) of an Export-Import Bank loan which matures in 1975; the
balance (US$3.4 million) of a loan from the Morgan Guaranty International
Finance Corporation maturing in 1990 and partial releases (US$0.29 million)
in respect of two loans amounting to US$44 million from the Asian Development
Bank (ADB).



- 19 -
7.09      NPC bonds are subscribed mainly by Government institutions.  The
bonds carry interest at rates varying between 4% and 7% per annum. Sinking
funds which have been created to repay them are administered by the Central
Bank. A recent revision of NPC Charter (para 4.05) provides for the conver-
sion to equity capital of the existing bonded indebtedness of i 246.93 mil-
lion, and this will be reflected in NPC's Balance Sheet as at June 30, 1974.
Accounts Receivable
7.10      NPC agreed in connection with Loan 809-PH that by June 30, 1973
unpaid accounts for electricity supplied would not exceed the three previous
monthis' revenue. However, outstanding accounts at that time amounted to
i 60.8 million which was equivalent to six months' revenue.
7.11      During FY 1973, agreement was reached between NPC and certain
delinquent power consumers for repayment: by monthly installments (with
interest) over periods ranging from 36-60 months, along with the current
billing. These include the City of Olongapo (i 5 million), other Electric
Utilities (I 11 million) and others, leaving current receivables of i 39.8
million as follows:

7.12      NPC has already introduced revised billing and collection procedures
as well as revised conditions of supply which involve a discount for prompt
payment, disconnection for nonpayment, an interest charge of 1% per month on
amounts not paid and reconnection fees after disconnection for non-payment.
In addition the Government has recognized NPC's difficulties in collecting
its unpaid accounts and has set up a special committee chaired by the
Executive Secretary to look into the management and financial affairs of
NPC's delinquent customers, particularly cement companies, which claim that
the controlled price of cement is too low, and to recommend the action which
the Government and/or NPC should take.



- 20 -
7.13      NPC's current receivables have further increased as of March 31,
1974, to ) 59.3 million due chiefly to continued nonpayment by eight
delinquent cement companies and Baguio City and partly to increased amounts
billed due to the fuel surcharge. In view of a recent increase in the
controlled price of cement, companies should now be able to pay current
bills and gradually liquidate back accounts of over t 17 million. The
cement companiesi have agreed to such an arrangement by monthly installments
(with interest at 6% p.a.) spread over periods varying between 12 to 36
months. The first payments began at the end of May 1974. Default will
involve disconnection and interest at the rate of 14% per annum. The city
of Baguio owes 1 5.4 million. An NEA assisted cooperative has now taken
over the Baguio electric power system and under arrangements with NEA about
F 3.0 million representing the approximate deduction from the ;urchase
price is to be turned over to NPC. Arrangements are being madu with the
Government for the liquidation of the balance of Baguio's account.
7.14      Similarly, disconnection of service to utilities has forced
members of the Philippine Electric Plant Owners Association (PEPOA) to
undertake similar arrangements for paying current billings and gradually
liquidating arrears. Also, in the takeover of utilities by NEA assisted
cooperatives (para 3.11) arrangements have been made with NEA to hand over
to NPC amounts corresponding to the indebtedness of these utilities. In
view of these arrangements NPC agreed it would be able to meet the test
established with Loan 809-PH, by December 31, 1976.
Proposed Financing Plan
7.15      Annex 13 contains consoLidated income statements for FY 1974 through
FY 1980. Tariff increases as necessary to meet the annual rate of return of
not less than 8% are assumed for FY 1975 and in later years. Annexes 14-16
and 18-20 give information relating to NPC's separate operations in its Luzot,
Visayas and Mindanao regions. They are based on sales forecasts by IECO for
Luzon; by a survey team from the Electric Power Development Company (EPDC)
and the Overseas Technical Corporation Agency (OTCA) of Japan which prepared
a study in connection with the Cebu Electric Power Grid Project in Visayas;
and by NPC in respect of the Mindaz%ao development. Annex 17 presents con-
solidated sources and applications of funds for FY 1974 through FY 1980.
These forecasts (Annexes 13 through 20) are based on the investment program
shown by Annex 21, the debt service schedule shown by Annex 22, and the
assumptions made in preparing the forecasts, Annex 23. These forecasts
produce the following financing plan covering the project construction period
FY 1975 through FY 1978:

7.16      NPC's construction expenditure would amount to US$463 million, of
which 54% would be spent in Luzon, 5% in the Visayas region and 41% in the
Mindanao region.
7.17      Forecast cash generation (net of debt service) would finance 15%
of capital expenditure during the construction period. On a regional basis
Luzon's net cash generation would finance 22% of its investment program,
and the Visayas and Mindanao regions would finance 11% and 6% respectively.
The cash generation available in Visayas by the small isolated plant would
be negligible before the proposed new plant is commissioned in FY 1976. The
internally generated funds in Mindanao would also be small until the hydro-
electric projects and transmission lines financed by ADB are commissioned in
about 2 years' time. Some delay in the Mindanao investment program may well
result due to the continuing unrest in the area.
7.18      Borrowing would finance 84% of the investment program with the
balance of 1% being supplied as an equity contribution equivalent to the
value of Japanese reparation goods received during the period. Borrowings
would be as follows:

7.19      NPC would have firm foreign currency commitments for $157 million,
assuming the proposed Bank loan of $61 million is approved.  It includes
$43 million of the $50 million loan from a group of Italian banks, repre-
sented by Interbanca to finance the proposed Kalayaan pumped storage project
(300 MW) and Geothermal projects (100 MW). The loan, at 6-1/2% per annum,
is repayable over 15 years (including 5 years' grace). A gap of $129 million
in foreign capital exists in the 4-year financing plan in connection with
the following:
(a) Diesel (5 x 10 MW) - Coal Plant (50 MW)
including Transmission (Visayas)                     $16 million
(b)  Cost Overrun on ADB Projects (Mindanao)              $24 million
(c)  Additional Hydroelectric Plant (Mindanao)            $58 million
(d) Nuclear (600 MW), Chico II Hydro Plant (240 MW)
and Other Transmission (Luzon)                       $13 million
(e)  Cagayan Transmission & Tiwi plant (Luzon)            $18 million
NPC has asked ADB for supplemental loans to meet cost overruns on ADB
ongoing projects, and agreement is anticipated. ADB is also expected to
finance additional hydroelectric facilities in the Mindanao development
program.
7.20      The US Exim Bank is expected to finance the proposed nuclear
power project. Discussions were initiated by NPC and the Government in
May, 1974. A turnkey package is being considered.
7.21      NPC proposes to obtain domestic capital of about ' 718 million
(US$105 million equivalent) during the four-year period chiefly by the sale
of 7% Bonds maturing after 25 years, and partly by borrowing the peso count-
erpart funds of about f 100 million from the Government's Commodity Loan,
funded by Japan, needed for those projects which OECF agrees to finance.



- 23 -
These funds will be provided for in the Government's four-year infrastructure
programs, approved by the President each year for the following four-year
period. However, in view of the possible revision of the investment program
(para 3.08) the financing plan would require reconsiderations particularly in
connection with NPC's ability to service its debt.
Future Operating Results
7.22      NPC's total energy sales are estimated to increase from 2,011 GWh
in FY 1973 to 7,358 GWh in FY 1980 which is an average annual growth rate
of about 20%. A growth rate in Luzon region of about 13% per annum is esti-
mated, while in Mindanao and Visayas regions, the estimated annual growth
rates are about 34% and 90%, respectively. The extraordinarily high growth
rate in Visayas arises because the base is small and demand suppressed.
With the commissioning of the proposed new generation plant energy sales
are expected to jump from 6.7 GWh in FY 1973 to 151 GWh in FY 1976, to
308 GWh in FY 1978, and to 528 GWh by FY 1980.
7.23      The fuel clause which was effective from July 1973 would compen-
sate for variations in the cost of fuel and its operation would have negli-
gible effect upon the annual rate of return, although it would increase the
price of energy sold to the consumer. Assuming the cost of fuel at US$8.80
per barrel, average fuel surcharges to Luzon consumers would amount to
USO.35 cents per kWh or a 39% over scheduled tariffs. Forecast earnings
in FY 1974 show that NPC would only achieve a 6.2% rate of return compared
to the 8% minimum required by Loan 809-PH. This is mainly due to a lack of
action to increase tariffs, to salary and wage increases, and to continuing
inflation. In FY 1975 and subsequent years tariff increases 1/ are assumed
which would produce revenues to meet the 8% rate of return required.
7.24      Condensed balance sheets at June 30, 1973 through June 30, 1980
(Annex 12) show that NPC's gross plant value would increase 3.5 times from
) 1,440 million (US$210 million) to t 5,043 million (US$736 million). Plant
in the Luzon region would increase by US$292 million (2.5 times), that in
Mindanao by US$211 million (12 times), and that in Visayas by US$22 million
(14 times).
7.25      NPC's capital structure is satisfactory.  The Charter, revised by
Presidential Decree No. 380 in January 1974, provides for increased capital
subscription by the Government by an amount equal to the outstanding cost
of reparation goods and existing bonded indebtedness. The cost of repara-
tion goods that may be allocated to NPC in the future and certain future
bond issues will also be subscribed. The conversion of about 0 247 million
from existing debt into equity would be implemented during FY 1974. The
debt/equity ratio would nevertheless increase from 37/63 in FY 1974 to
70/30 by FY 1980 reflecting the large borrowings required to finance the
investment program. The ratio would be acceptable.
1/   Paragraph 4.07.



- 24 -
7.26      The ratio of current assets to liabilities would be 1.7 in FY 1974
and 1.8 in FY 1975 before reducing gradually to 1.1 by FY 1980. Net income
(before interest) would cover annual interest chargeable to revenue by
2.4 times in FY 1974 rising to 6.2, 12.4 and 4 times in FY 1975 through
FY 1977. The high coverage in F-Y 1975 through FY 1977 coincides with the
period of construction when a major part of the interest would be capital-
ized. The coverage would fall to 1.9 times in FY 1978 and to 1.7 times by
FY 1980.
7.27      The existing debt limitation covenant requires NPC to obtain the
Bank's agreement before incurring long-term debt when its current revenues
are less than 1.3 times the maximum future debt service on existing debt
including the debt to be incurred. The covenant is repeated in the proposed
loan agreement.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following points
and appropriate covenants included in the legal documents for the proposed
loan:
(a) consultants services (paras 5.09, 5.14);
(b) NPC-MECO agreement (para 5.13);
(c) level of account receivables (para 7.14); and
(d) debt control (para 7.27).
8.02      With the above assurances, the Project is suitable for a Bank
loan of US$61 million equivalent for a term of 25 years, including a grace
period of 4 years.

ESTABLISHING BASIC POLICIES FOR THE ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY
WHEREAS, one of the primary concerns of the government in pro-
moting the economic welfare of the people is to hasten the electrifi-
cation of the entire country, more particularly the rural areas; and
WHEREAS, it is necessary to establish certain basic policies for
the attainment of said objective;
NOW, THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E. MARCOS, President of the
Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the Constitution
as Commander-in-Chief of all the Armed Forces of the Philippines; and

PHILIPPINES
National Policy Objective for Total Electrification
(extracted from Presidential Decree No. 26Y dated August 6, 1973)
t'SEC. 2. Declaration of National Policy. -- The total electri-
fication of the Philippines on an area coverage basis being vital
to the welfare of its people and the sound development of the Nation,
it is hereby declared to be the policy of the State to pursue and
foster, in an orderly and vigorous manner, the attainment of this
objective. For this purpose, the State shall promote, encourage
and assist all public service entities engaged in supplying elec-
tric service, particularly electric cooperatives, which are willing
to pursue diligently this objective.
"Because of their non-profit nature, cooperative character
and the heavy financial burdens that they must sustain to become
effectively established and operationally viable, electric co-
operatives, particularly, shall be given every tenable support
and assistance by the National Government, its instrumentalities
and agencies to the fullest extent of which they are capable;
and, being by their nature substantially self-regulating and
Congress having, by the enactment of this Decree, substantially
covered all phases of their organization and operation requir-
ing or justifying regulation, and in order to further encourage
and promote their development, they should be subject to minimal
regulation by other administrative agencies.
"Area coverage electrification cannot be achieved unless
service to the more thinly settled ares and therefore more costly
to electrify is combined with service to the most densely settled
areas and therefore less costly to electrify. Every public ser-
vice entity should hereafter cooperate in a national program of
electrification on an area coverage basis, or else surrender its
franchise in favor of those public service entities which will.
It is hereby found that the total electrification of the Nation
requires that the laws and administrative practices relating to
franchised electric service areas be revised and made more effec-
tive as herein provided. It is therefore hereby declared to be
the policy of the State that franchises for electric service
areas shall hereafter be so issued, conditioned, altered or re-
pealed, and shall be subject to such continuing regulatory sur-
veillance, that the same shall conduce to the most expeditious
electrification of the entire Nation on an area coverage basis.t"

T2: The National Electrification Administration
In view of the desire to effect changes and reforms in the social,
economic and political structure of our society, and with the promul-
gation of Presidential Decree No. 40 dated November 7, 1972, as a
means of converting small private/municipal systems to electric co-
operatives in accordance with Republic Act No. 6038, the National
Electrification Administration (NEA) is hereby directed to immedi-
ately implement and enforce strictly the provisions of the
Presidential Decree No. 40.
The NEA is hereby directed to establish procedures, systems and
organizations with defined functions for the prompt implementation
of said decree.
The NEA as the implementing agency shall determine which systems
should be converted or integrated in accordance with the following
criteria:
1) Systems with exorbitant rates and notoriously
poor service.
2) Systems which are delinquent in their amortiza-
tion payments to NEA and other banking institutions
and/or payment to NPC of their power bills.
3) Systems connected to NPC or Meralco and therefore
do not have generating plants.
4) Systems within the proposed 36 cooperative areas.
The following shall be the priority list of municipalities of the
seven (7) provinces considered as pilot projects:

PHILIPPINES - NATIONAL POWER GORPORATION
SIXTH POWER PROJECT
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
The protect comprises:
1.        the Pantabangan hydroelectric plant. (100 W) as a part of
the multi-purpose Upper Pampanga River Project;
2.        part of the transmission expansion program in Luzon comprising
transmission lines of 210 km at 230 kV and 535 km at 69 kV and
33 substations of 1,375 MVA aggregate capacity; and
3.        feasibility studies for the Chico river development and a
dispatching center.
1.        Pantabangan Hydroelectric Project
The Pantabangan power plant is one of the major components of the
Upper Pampanga .River Project (UPRP) which was envisioned to be a multi-
purpose development aimed at regulating and utilizing the seasonal flows of
the Pampanga river and its tributaries for irrigation, flood control and power
generation. The National Irrigation Administration (NIA) is implementing
the UPIRP with the assistance of Bank Loan 637-PH; the principal features are:
(a)  construction of an earth-fill dam of 110 meters high
to provide a reservoir with a storage capacity of
about 3,400 F1CM;
(b) rehabilitation of existing irrigation systems serving
about 46,000 ha; and
(c)  construction of new irrigation systems to serve about
31, 000 ha.
The dam will be completed in mid-1974 and the remainder of UPRP is expected
to.be completed by the end of 1975.
The power addition to be financed by the proposed loan includes:
(a) construction of an enclosed type power plant at the
foot of the dam immediately below the outlet of diversion
tunnel No.2 and installation of two 50 MW turbine generators.
Tunnel No.2 was built for diversion purposes but planned
for use as a power tunnel by installing a 270 m long penstock.
Tunnel No.1 will remain as an irrigation outlet. If a
diversion from an adjacent water shed is realized (the
Casecnan project), tunnel No.1 would be utilized as a power
tunnel for two additional units with a possible capacity
of 65 i4W each;



ANNEX 6
Page 2 of 3 pages
(b) construction of a switchyard adjacent to the power
house with two 64 MVA step-up transformers and associated
230 kV switching equipment;
(c) construction of a 230 kV double-circuit transmission line
about 23 km long to connect the Pantabangan plant to the
existing 230 kV Luzon grid; and
(d)  construction of a re-regulation dam about 24 m high
between the power plant and the downstream irrigation
diversion dam. The reservoir would have storage capacity
of about 3.6 MCM, sufficient to permit daily regulations
of water releases from the power plant.
Since the benefits from irrigation are substantially higher
than those from power generation, the water releases will be dictated by
irrigation demands. The reservoir operating pattern will release water in
the rice growing period during the dry 3eason, December through March;
practically all inflow be stored during the wet season. With the re-regulation
dam downstream NPC will be able to operate the plant according to its system
requirements without detriment to irrigation. During the dry season, the
plant would operate at full turbine capacity of between 100 and 70 MW depending
on the reservoir level, for nine hours during the peak demand period. The
balance of the available energy would be spread more or less evenly over the
remainder of the day. During the wet season, the minimum required discharge
from the reservoir would give NPC average 5 MW of power; on this basis the
plant would be used for peaking at 70 Hi for about two hours a day. The average
annual energy is estimated at 262 GWh. Additional 31 GWh could be added after
the completion of the Aurora diversion scheme in 1976.
The reservoir operating pattern described above fits very well into
the Luzon system operation.  During the months of maximum irrigation usage,
December through March, the reservoirs of existing hydro plants on the NPC
system are being drawn down rapidly to provide energy to the system. The
energy produced by Pantabangan during these months would reduce the drawdown
of existing hydro reservoirs, thereby increasing both the capacity and energy
available during April through June, the critical months for NPC hydro power.
2.        Transmission Exansion Program
The program, Phase IV of the Luzon Electrification Plan, consists
of the following:
(a) Ilocos Region Electrification Project (IREP)
(b) Central Luzon Electrification Project (CLEP)
(c) Zambales Electrification Project (ZEP)
(d) Laguna Batangas Electrification Project (LBEP)
(e) Southern Luzon Electrification Project (SLEP)
(f) Special Project
The IREP, CLEP, ZEP and LBEP projects wi-'l expand system capability to meet
increasing demands in the provincial areas by reinforcing existing facilities
and extending new facilities into rural areas. The SLEP project will extend
230 kV transmission from Naga to Legaspi via the Tiwi geothermal field. The



ANNEX 6
Page 3 of 3 pages
output of the Tiwi plant will be transmitted to the Greater Manila area over
this line. The link between the Manila area (the Malaya thermal plant) and
Naga is included in the 5th Power Project. The line is designed for double
circuit but only one circuit will be strung initially.  This will provide
ransmitting capacity of 150 MW from Tiwi to Mani-la.  After 1980, when the
Tiwi. field is developed to over 150 MW, the second circuit will be added.
rhe SLI2 project also includes subtransmission projects to supply electricity
to towns and municipalities in the Southern Luzon Region. The Special Project
would consist of a double circuit 230 kV line between the Dolores and the
Sapang Palay substations and 230 kV/115 kV/69 kV transformers and associated
switching equipment at both substations.  The project will transmit the output
of the M4alaya plant to two main Load substations in the Manila area, will
increase the power interchange capacity between NPC and MECO and will interconnect
the NPC's main grid in the north to the grid in the south including the future
Tiwi and Kalayaan power plants.

SIXTH POWER PROJECT
TRANSFER FR)M FIFTH POWER PROJEThT
The Fifth Power Project (Loan 809/Credit 296-PH dated April 3,
1972) consisted of the No.2 thermal unit at Bataan (150 NW), transmission
system expansion and management and engineering consulting services.
(Contracts for the Bataan unit have been awarded; all consulting services
included in the project have been contracted, and some of them have already
been completed. Consequently, the funds available for the transmission
element of the project can be estimated fairly accurately. The total
amount available is US$ 11.0 million, consisting of an initial allocation
for transmission facilities of US$ 9.0 million plus US$ 2.0 million
reallocated from contingency provisions.
'The original transmission program included in the Fifth Power
Project consisted of:
(a)  317 km of 230 kV lines and 90 km of 115 kV lines;
(b)  440 Ian of 69 kV lines and 586 km of 13.8 kV lines;
(c)  8 large substations (245 MVA) at 230 kV and 115 kV; and
(d)  16 load-end substations (95 MVA) at 69 kV.
Implementation of the program has been slow;11 the bids for large transformers
and 230 kV lines were not invited until October and November 1973, respectively.
aidding results revealed considerable cost increases as compared to appraisal
estimates  with the foreign exchange component for only 230 kV lines and
large transformers amounting to US$ 11.0 million, total amount available for the
entire program. The breakdown of the cost increases is shown below:

1/ Due to the need to engage consultants and the time required by them to review
and revise NRCts design.
2/ A ranre of estimates by major suppliers of increases between the time of the
the appraisal estimate (late 1971) and the time of bidding.



ANNEX 7
Page 2 of 2 pages
After review of the original plan by consultants, the originating point
of the 230 kV line to Southern Luzon was changed from the Caliraya hydro
plant to the Malaya thermal plant.  This, together with deviations from
the originally planned route after survey, resulted in an increase in the
total length of the line of 36 km. The original underestimate can be
mainly attributable to the omission of foreign exchange costs in the
erection portion of the contract.
(2)   Large Transformers
The cost of large transformers was included in the total cost
of substations and not separated in the original cost estimate. However,
an increase in tran3tormer capacity from 2)45 "IVA to 315 MVA would account
for any cost increases. The foreign exchange cost of the transformers
contracted for is relatively small compared to that for transmission lines,
amounting only to US$ 1.15 million equivalent.
As shown above, it is apparent that funds available for the
transmission program in the Fifth Loan are only sufficient for the 230 kV
lines and large transformers. The remaining items, not having been put
to bid, are prcposed to be transferred to and financed under the Sixth
Loan. There have been additional changes in the schedules of the remaining
items due to utilization of war reparation materials, transfer of 13.8 kV lines
to NEA. and design changes recommended by consultants. Thus, items transferred
from the Fifth and included in the Sixth Power Loan are:
(a) Major substations:
Switching equipment and steel structure for 230 kV and
115 kV substations
(b) 69 kV transmission lines:
About 250 km of 69 kV lines
(c) Load-end substations:
13 substations at 69 kV with the total capacity of 75 INIVA
(d) Power line carrier equipment and relays.
The total foreign exchange cost of these items is estimated at US$ 8.0 million.

SIXTH POWER PROJECT
ECONOMIC EVALUATION OF PANTABANGAN INVESTMENT
Economic viability of the Pantabangan project has been evaluated
by three different ways:
(1) Costs comparison of Pantabangan versus gas turbine
- least cost calculation
(2) Costs of Pantabangan versus fuel replacement benefits on
existing thermal plant.
(3) Return on investments for Pantabangan using revenues as benefits
- finazcial rate of return
1. General Assumption
(a) Plant data
firm capacity            -     70 MW
firm energy              -     140 GWh (85 MW x 9 hr/day x 6 months)
secondary energy         -     153 GWh
total annual energy      -     293 G(h
(b) Capital Cost
1973 price             1977 price      Other cost         total cost
Pantabangan US$ 21.2 million  US$ 28.3 million  US$ 5.6 million  US$ 33.9 million
Gas turbine US$ 150/kW        US$ 180/kW              -           US$ 180/kw
1977 price was calculated in accordance with the "Revised Interim Guidelines on
Treatment of Project Cost Increases" of March 29, 1974. Other cost includes
engineering cost, physical contingency and interest during construction. Plant
life of 50 years for Pantabangan and 25 years for gas turbine were assumed.
(c) O/M cost
pantabangan: 1% of capital cost annually
Gas turbine: 3% of capital cost annually
(d)  Fuel cost
1977-1980 - prices suggested in the 'Interim Guidelines for
Energy" of January 11, 1974.
1981 and thereafter - fixed at 1980 price.

(e) Heat rate
gas turbine - 13,,400 Btu/kWh
existing thermal - 10,000 Btu/kWh
vf) Tariffs based on fuel price of P 1.10/MBtu (fuel price included
in the present tariffs)
Average tariff level in 1973 - P 0.063/kWh
demand charge  first   1,000 kW           P 5.0/kW/month
next    9,000 kW          P 3.0/kW/month
energy charge  first   300 kWh per kW    (load factor up to 42%)
P 0.07/kWh
next    150 kWh per kW    (load factor between 42-63%)
P 0.05/kWh
all excess                P 0.04/kWh
Annual revenues from Pantabangan based on the above rate schedule:
demand charge 70 x 103 x 4 P/kW/month x 12  = P 3.36 million
energy charge 140 x 106 x 0.07               = P 9.80 million
153 x 106x 0o045              = p 6.89 million
Total                                           P20.05 million
Primary voltage discount 5%                     P19.04 million
Average tariff level expected in 1978 - P 0.083/kWh
Annual revenues from Pantabangan 19.04 x 0.083/0.063 = P 25.08 million
(g)  Tariffs based on fuel price of 1978.
If the tariffs were adjusted to cover the fuel price
expected in 1978, P 0.059/kWh in average would be transferred from
fuel surcharges to the tariffs on the basis of hydro-thermal mix
in 1978. This would increase revenues from Pantabangan to P 42.8
million.
Least Cost Calculation
Alternative 1 (Pantabangan)
Capital cost in 1977 and 0/M cost for 50 years were
considered in the cost stream.



Annex 11
Page 3 of 3 pages
Alternative 2 (Gas turbine)
It was assumed that a gas turbine would generate firm
energy equivalent of 140 GWh only and secondary energy
equivalent of 153 GWh would be produced by thermal
generation. After 25 years of gas turbine life, total energy
of 293 GWh would be supplied by thermal generation.
Capital cost and 0/1 cost of a gas turbine and fuel costs
for both gas turbine and thermal plant were considered in
the cost stream; incremental 0/M cost of thermal plant were
neglected.
Alternative 1 was found more economical for discount rates
up to 35%.
3. Costs of Pantabangan versus Fuel Replacement Benefits
In case demand growth prove to be lower than estimated,
Pantabangan might not be needed on the basis of supply-demand balance.
Yet it would have benefits of reducing existing thermal generation by
293 GWh annually thus saving fuel costs.
Benefits were found larger than costs of Pantabangan for
discount rates up to 16%.
4.  Financial Rate of Return
Benefits were measured by incremental revenues attributable
to the project using two different tariffs before and after adjustments
for fuel cost increases. The financial rates of return thus obtained
are 9.7% and 17.6%, respectively.

PHILIPPINES
NATIONAL POdER CORPORATION
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
The financial statements in this report cover NPCts electricity
supply operations in each of the regions of Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.
Separate income statements (Annexes 14-16) and sources and application
statements (Annexes 18-20) have been prepared for each region. These
statements have been consolidated to show NPC's overall position including
condensed Balance Sheets as at June 30, 1973, through 1980 (Annex 12).
The results for FY 1973 are based on the audited accounts for that year.
Income Statements
Luzon
Luzon Grid energy sales are based on forecasts made by
NPC's consultants (IECO)and are projected at an average annual
rate of 1210 from FY 1973 through FY 1980.
Isolated plant generation is projected assuming normal
operations until FY 1976 when about half the plant will be
connected to the Luzon Grid.
Visayas
Sales forecasts are based on a study by a survey team
from the Electric Power Development Company (EPDC) and the
Overseas Technical Corporation Agency (OTCA) of Japan. These
forecasts have been adopted by NPC in planning its construction
program in connection with the Cebu Electric Power Grid.
Mindanao
Sales forecasts are based on a comprehensive study by
NPC's consultants. The estimated load growth over the period
FY 1973 to FY 1980 averages a little less than 34% per annum.
Tariffs
Separate accounts are now prepared for NPC's operations in each
region, and the rates to be charged in each of the regions are determined
independently of each other in accordance with NPC's Charter (Republic
Act 6395 as amended by Presidential Decree No. 380). This means the tariffs
should be set with a view to making each region financially viable.
Luzon Grid
An increase of PO.005 per KWh sold is assumed from
July 1974, with additional increases of PO.006, and PO.0107,
PO.006, and PO.006 in FY 1977, FY 1978, fy 1979 and FY 1980
respectively. A fuel clause, in operation from July 1, 1973,
assumes recovery of all fuel costs in excess of the oase price



Annex 23
Page 2 of 3 pages
of P1.10 per million Btu's or USW1.02 per barrel.  The
fuel cost in FY 1974 is based on actual prices up to
November 1973 by which time fuel was US$4.40 per barrel.
Although prices subsequent to November 1973 have risen,
no attempt has been made to estimate them because the
additional expenses would be recovered by the surcharge.
NPC is exempt from all duties and taxes on fuel oil.
Luzon Isolated Plant - are producing losses. A tariff
increase of P0.027 per KWh is assumed from FY 1975 although
this will not produce sufficient revenue to meet operating
expenses.
Visayas - Isolated Plant - an increase of PO.033 per KWh is
assumed to bring the tariff into line with the rate of P0.12
for energy supplied by the Luzon Isolated Plant. This increase
would not produce sufficient revenue to meet operating expenses.
Visayas - Thermal Plant - A new tariff is assumed for application
in FY 1976 when the diesel plant is commissioned. A separate
fuel clause is also assumed.
Operating Expenses
The 1974 expenses were forecast on the known changes which have
taken place during the year, particularly on the restructuring of salaries
and allowances in accordance with recommendations of the management consultants
as approved by the Government. Inflation at about 9g per annum has Deen
assumed.
The forecast of operation and maintenance takes into account the
number and qualifications of staff employed at the end of FY 1973, and on
the forecast number required for the additional facilities as they are
commissioned.
Depreciation
N?Cts depreciation is based on the straight line method. Accrual
rates shown below, were calculated on the gross value of plant in service
at any given date.

Power Interchange
The power interchange agreement NPC/MECO is assumed to continue --
the net interchange in the projections is calculated on the basis of November
1973 fuel oil prices., However, any subsequent variation affecting the cost
of the energy supplied would also be discovered.
Interest Capitalised
Interest during construction was capitalised. The calculation
was made by applying the assumed rate of interest on foreign and local
loans to the foreign and domestic expenses on accumulating work in progress
up to the dates the plant or parts thereof are assumed commissioned.
Balance Sheet
NPC receivables at June 30 1973 of P60.82 million (current
customers - P39.85 million, and under the deferred payment plan -
P20.97 million) exceeded the sum equivalent to three previous months'
revenue required by the test imposed by Loan 809-PH. The forecasts
assume the continuation of regular payments in respect of all deferred
plan accounts. The forecast current accounts receivables were assumed at
the equivalent of three months revenue in FY 1974 reducing to 2½ months in
FY 1975 - FY 1977 and to two months revenue equivalent in FY 1978 and
thereafter. The reduction is now possible since discounts for early payment
can be obtained and clinquent customers will be subject to review by a
special Government Committee. Any fuel price escalation over the November
1973 price used on the Income Statement would increase the accounts receivable
e.g. a doubled fuel cost to US$8.80 would increase the price per KWh and
would involve an increase of over 10% in the accounts receivable from customers.
Inventory and materials
Assumed at 3yO of net plant until FY 1977 and thereafter at 2%
on the much increased value of plant commissioned.
Interest Payable
Assumed approximately 3 month interest accruals on outstanding
debt.
Accounts Payable
Based on the routine delay of about one month in paying for
supplies of fuel, operation and maintenance (other than salaries, wages,
and depreciation) and equipment and materials for construction.
