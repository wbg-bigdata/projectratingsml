Program Development   Development Objectives. The BEPSG-1-3 supports the
Objective(s) and      Government’s Ten-Year Basic Education Sector Program
Contribution to CAS   which aims to (i) Improve access and equity in basic education
                      (ii) Improve quality, efficiency, and relevance of basic
                      education and (iii) Strengthen sector management.
                      Contribution to the CAS. The Basic Education Sector
                      Program is consistent with the country’s Strategy for
                      Sustainable Accelerated Growth and Sustainable Development
                      (SCADD) and the CAS priorities for the period 2010-2012.
Risks and Risk        Macroeconomic risk. The recent rebound in gold and cotton
Mitigation            prices has helped Burkina Faso recover from the global
                      economic crisis. However, the country remains heavily
                      exposed to swings in its terms-of-trade and weather-related
                      shocks. Growing import demand and increasing oil prices,
                      coupled with a deterioration of the terms of trade, could
                      weaken the country’s external position. Other potential risks
                      include a decline in foreign aid that threatens debt
                      sustainability and allocations to the education and training
                      sector. Effective implementation of growth-enhancing reforms,
                      export diversification availability of GPE funds will help
                      mitigate these risks. vii education sector is also prioritized in
                                            The
                      the MTEF. Reforms related to multi-grade classes, abolition
                      of biennial intake, enrollment and equity might trigger
                      resistance. This is being addressed through sound consensus

                 PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
   PROPOSED THIRD BASIC EDUCATION PROGRAM SUPPORT GRANT
                      TO BURKINA FASO

I. INTRODUCTION
1.      Financing of BEPSG 1 – 3. Burkina Faso requested and obtained assistance
from the Education for All/Fast-Track Initiative (EFA/FTI) in the amount of US$102
million in 2008 to complement financing from the government and other partners for the
implementation of its Ten-Year Basic Education Development Program (PDDEB) 2000
to 2010. These resources were provided from the EFA/FTI’s Catalytic Fund which was
set up by the EFA/FTI, to help countries reach the EFA goals. The Government and the
World Bank decided that the EFA/FTI funds would be provided through a programmatic
series of three single tranche development policy operations governed by the World
Bank’s Operational Policy 8.60, to support sector policy reforms and institutional
strengthening (the Basic Education Program Support Grants (BEPSG 1-3).

2.      The EFA/FTI whose name has since been changed to the Global Partnership for
Education (GPE) is a partnership of developing and donor countries and agencies
designed to support EFA goals by focusing on accelerating progress towards the core
EFA goal of universal primary school completion (UPC). It was established in 2002,
following the development consensus reached at Monterrey. It is a compact for the
education sector that explicitly links increased donor support for primary education to
recipient countries’ policy performance and accountability for results. Specifically, the
GPE aims to accelerate UPC by promoting: a) More efficient use of aid for basic
education; b) Sustained increases in aid for basic education to reach minimum acceptable
levels; c) Sound sector policies in education; d) Adequate and sustainable domestic
financing for education and e) Increased accountability for sector results.

3.     The agreement for the first EFA/FTI grant in the amount of US$22 million was
signed on June 29, 2009, and the agreement for the second grant of $45 million was
signed on March 29, 2011. This third and final Grant of $35 million is planned to be
approved in March, 2012.

4.      Context and Evolution of BEPSG 1 – 3.           The BEPSG 1-3 series is designed
to support introduction of policy and institutional reforms to remove constraints that have
limited government efforts to develop the sector. The first phase implementation of the
PDDEB emphasized expansion of the system through direct investments and included
few key policy reforms and institutional changes needed for sustained development of the
sub sector. As a result, even though substantial progress was made, the absence of needed
policy reforms limited the contribution of these investments to achievement of the MDGs
related to the basic education sub-sector. The reforms proposed to be supported in this
final grant are directly linked to the objectives of PDDEB which are to (i) Improve
access, equity, and expand coverage of basic education (preschool, primary, lower

                                               ix
secondary education and vocational training as well as literacy programs); (ii) Improve
quality, efficiency, and relevance of basic education; and (iii) Strengthen sector
management (fiduciary, administrative, and pedagogic management) and monitoring, in
the context of decentralization of management of basic education services.

5.      The PDDEB was updated and approved by the Council of Ministers in June,
2008, and re-endorsed by members of the LDG in September, 2008. The PDDEB which
was expected to end in 2010 was initially extended to 2011, but was further updated and
the revised plan will now be implemented through 2012. The updated plan retains
essentially the same overall objectives but the contents reflect progress made in the sector
over the last ten years and the objectives of the new SCADD (new development strategy
that replaces PRSPs). A new ten-year Plan for 2012 to 2020 is being finalized and will
include greater emphasis on post primary and technical education as well as vocational
training without prejudice to basic education.

6.     Progress under BEPSG 1 and 2.    Several important reform actions took place
under BEPSG 1 and 2, as detailed in annex 1. These measures have led to significant
improvements in the education sector:

a.   Improvements to annual work programs, budgeting and financing of the education
     sector have strengthened collaboration between the government and partners and
     has improved predictability in the availability of resources.

b.   The expansion of multi-grade teaching has resulted in increased and more equitable
     access to primary education. Between 2008/09 and 2010/11, the enrollment rate
     increased from 72.4% to 77.6%, and girls’ enrollment rate increased from 67.7% to
     75.0% much higher than for boys. The number of schools that do not offer a full
     cycle of six grades from 3,062 in 2008/09 to 2,014 in 2010/11, representing a 37%
     decline.

c.   With regard to decentralization of education sector management to communes the
     process is now well advanced and support has been provided to increase their
     effectiveness. The foundation is now set for further decentralization of some
     responsibilities to the Community/school based local education management
     committees (COGES) and a prior action on such further decentralization is included
     in this operation.

d.   The new university based program for training secondary Science and Math
     teachers is in place and the distance education program, which is a prior action for
     the BEPSG 3 has started. While in previous years’ science and math teachers were
     difficult to recruit, in 2009/2010 732 such teachers were recruited satisfying 85% of
     the needs.

e.   The primary level repetition rates dropped substantially from 10.6% in 2008 to
     8.1% in 2010. For first cycle of secondary education, the repetition rate fell
     modestly from 26.3% in 2008 to about 26% in 2010. Similarly, from 2009/10 to

                                             2
     2010/11, dropout rates fell in the first two sub-cycles of primary education from 6%
     to 4%.

f.   Effective teaching time in primary education has increased from 574 hours or about
     59.6% of the total to an estimated 736, 76.5% of the total.

g.    It is too soon to attribute changes in completion rates to the measures related to
     student assessment. However, Completion rates for primary education rose from
     41.7% in 2008 to 52.1% in 2010. In first cycle secondary education, completion
     rates increased from 15.8% in 2008 to 17.5% in 2010. Focus on student might have
     contributed to this improvement.

h.   The issue of adequate HIV/AIDS, health and nutrition education is now being
     systematically addressed, as the strategy was approved by cabinet in October 2009
     and a new curriculum for these areas was introduced in lower secondary education
     in 2010.

i.   The shared use of resources by training institutions resulted in 1,411 apprentices
     from programs run by the Ministry of Youth and Sports being certified in 2009.

7.       The prior actions for this third operation are based on the results achieved from
the first and second operations and are aimed at deepening implementation of the reform
program.

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT
Political Developments

  8.    During February and June 2011, Burkina Faso experienced episodes of civil
unrest unprecedented in the 23 years of President Blaise Compaoré’s tenure.
Demonstrations by students, the military, labor unions and the political opposition led to
frequent incidents of looting. Popular dissatisfaction was sparked by rising fuel and food
prices, limited political debate, perceived corruption, abuse of procurement processes and
mistrust of the justice system. In mid-April, after ad-hoc measures to contain the
violence proved ineffective, the President dissolved the cabinet and appointed many
newcomers to the Government. The situation improved, although sporadic incidents of
military unrest continued, including the mutiny in Bobo-Dioulasso on June 3 which
resulted in the deaths of six protesting soldiers and one innocent bystander.

9.      The Government has initiated a dialogue with different socio-political groups
and stakeholders, responding to demands for institutional and political change. In
July, the Government also terminated employment of 566 military officers, of which 217
were arrested pending legal proceedings for their involvement in the unrest. A
Consultative Council, consisting of members of the opposition, government officials and
civil society representatives, was established to promote dialogue and reflection on
political governance and institutional reform. On July 14, the 68 member Constitutional
Council produced a report of its recommendations, including: the introduction of a

                                            3
Senate, constitutional recognition of traditional chiefs and a limited amnesty for former
heads of state. Although some opposition parties and civil society organizations
boycotted the Council, the Government has called for open participation in the national
hearings planned for September. During the recent Council report ceremony, the
President has confirmed his commitment to deepen reform, although many challenges
remain. The important objective will be to address fundamental issues of injustice and
corruption in a transparent and equitable manner and to ensure the reforms are
implemented.
Recent Economic Developments in Burkina Faso

10.    Growth: In 2010, economic growth accelerated to 7.9 percent, up from 3.2
percent in 2009. Growth is projected at 5.8 percent in 2011. A combination of favorable
weather conditions and better incentives for farmers, higher gold production and prices,
and increased public investment have helped fuel this recovery. The large share of growth
in 2010 was accounted for by industry, in particular gold mining, although agriculture
and industry contributed their share. A decrease in the rate of economic growth to 5.2
percent of GDP is projected, partly due to a weaker agricultural performance.

                           Figure 1: Sectoral Contribution to Growth




11.     Growth and investment have had multiple drivers. In 2009, growth was
mainly driven by exports of goods and services and consumption. Consumption absorbed
most of the GDP in 2010, reaching 90 percent. Public consumption has absorbed around
one-fifth of the GDP in 2010. The investment rate has fluctuated in recent years, but in
2010, it reached 19 percent of GDP. Private investment has also fluctuated and stayed at
about 10 percent of GDP in 2010. The recent social unrest has adversely affected
investment, and early estimates in 2011 suggest a possible decrease in both public and
private investment by about 0.7 percent of GDP.

                        Figure 2: Demand Side Contribution to Growth




12.     Fiscal situation: The overall fiscal deficit, including grants, is projected at about
4 percent of GDP in 2011. A preliminary assessment of the first revised budget law for
2011 shows that new measures enacted in response to civil unrest (lower taxes on
salaries, abolition of the communal tax, payment of housing allowances for military
personnel, compensation to small merchants for property damage, and fixing the price of
food items of vital importance to the poor) will have at most a marginal impact on the
fiscal deficit since the bulk of the proposed expenditure increases will be financed
through a reallocation of investment expenditures from non- priority sectors. The
financing from project loans currently stands at US$183 million (50 percent of the
forecast amount); central bank credit has covered the deficit for US$132 million, while
commercial banks have contributed over US$10 million. Also, the authorities have
succeeded in launching four T-bill operations within the WAEMU financial market. An
amount of US$79 million has been mobilized, demonstrating the credibility of the
national treasury.

13.     The resource mobilization effort remains satisfactory. Although in the last
three years, expenditures have increased at a faster pace than revenues, there has been an
increase in the pace of resource mobilization. Revenue collection has strengthened due to
administrative efficiency gains, and one-off nontax revenue from the renewal of cellular
phone licenses. By the end of July 2011, revenue collected stood at US$1 million out of a
US$1.6 million forecast, around 65 percent of the IMF revised program targets, the result
of improved tax administration and new contributions from the mining sector, whose
exemption period has come to an end. Value-added taxes have been collected at more
than 60 percent of the total envisaged annual target as of July, and are on track with the
IMF program. Customs has reached their mid-year targets of duty collection. At this
point, the reductions in the salary tax rate and elimination of the communal development
tax, introduced to address demands during the social unrest, have not significantly
impacted public revenues. At the same time, the grants were only 26 percent of the
forecasted amounts compared to 35 percent in June 2010, due to delays in donor

                                             5
disbursements. Therefore, the overall revenue collection needs to improve by the end of
the year to get closer to the regional target of 17 percent for WAEMU.

                      Figure 3: Revenues and Expenditures (% of GDP)




14.     Current expenditures are rising, while the pace of executions of investment
spending has been slow. Current expenditure is forecasted at 13.5 percent of GDP,
partly because of measures undertaken to mitigate the crisis, amounting to 26 billion
FCFA. Capital expenditure, which has increased in recent years, due to special
infrastructure projects, has slowed down, while the wage policy, despite some reforms,
continues to remain prudent. Total expenditures stand at 48 percent of forecasted annual
amount by end of July. Current expenditures reached US$737 million over the first seven
months of 2011, salaries have been paid for 58 percent of the total annual wage bill,
while current transfers account for 45 percent despite the increased subsidies for food and
fuel to address the social unrest. Conversely, public investments have been slower
compared to 2010 because of uncertainty in the mobilization of budget support following
the social unrest. Investments financed by internal resources (US$316 million) are
currently more than those financed by foreign resources, demonstrating the weak
mobilization of project and program grants. Despite the new agenda of aid efficiency, the
Government still faces some problems with donors’ grant/loan procedures. Commitments
are on track in resource allocation to priority sectors such as health and basic education.
Also, expenditures on priority sectors represent 80 percent of the total amount.

15.     Burkina Faso has improved budget transparency over the years. In 2010, the
PEFA exercise highlighted the improvements in publishing budget figures by the
Ministry of Economy and Finance on their website. The system was graded A, both in
2007 and 2010. Currently, central budget figures are published on the MEF’s website and
hard copies are also available for line ministries and civil society including local NGOs.
Starting 2011 the draft budget law of 2012 has been posted on the website and translated
into three native languages. This translation aims at increasing awareness of the
population at large about the budget proposals before they are adopted by the parliament.


                                            6
16.     Balance of payments: In 2011, the current account deficit (excluding grants)
was 11.2 percent. While the country has solid export performance from cotton and gold
exports, rises in global oil prices and higher non-oil imports used for investment purposes
have led to deterioration in the trade balance. This has been partially offset by increases
in transfers and remittances. The overall balance of payments financing will continue to
depend on public and private financing flows, particularly donor aid (mostly grant and
concessional) and remittances over the short and medium-term.


                         Figure 4: Current Account Deficit (% of GDP)




17.     Money and Banking: Monetary policy has remained prudent. The regional
central bank (BCEAO) has maintained prudent monetary policy through careful injection
of liquidity into the economy. There has been some increase in money supply, reflecting
the increase in net foreign assets of the banking system, while credit to the economy has
risen to finance the rising services sector.

18.      The inflation rate remains contained at low single digits. The inflation rate
stands at 2.8 percent in 2011 and has increased due to spillover effects from the Ivorian
crisis, increased global food and fuel prices, and supply disruptions from the social
unrest. From January to July, there has been a slight increase in food prices as the rise in
world prices has been largely offset by a favorable domestic harvest and subsidies in food
prices earlier in 2011, while the other expenditures, such as housing and electricity, have
risen to 5.3 percent. The subsidies for imported rice, oil and petroleum have been set up
only for three months as a response to the social unrest. Therefore, some inflationary
increase might be expected if subsidies are not maintained.

                           Figure 5: CPI end of period 2009-2011 (%)




19.     Burkina’s banking sector remains healthy, and the banks have been
observing regional prudential norms. The net credit to the economy has increased
US$44 million from January to June, 2011. The net government position has been
positive at US$138 million due to cautious monetary policy management during the
political crisis.

20.     Poverty: About 44% of the population is poor. In general, the impact of growth
on employment has not been strong, partly due to the enclave nature of the mining
industry. There has been some improvement in poverty over the years due to higher
agricultural production.

Medium Term Outlook

21.     Political stability is foreseen in the near future after the recent social unrest.
The Government has taken action to improve governance, although important challenges
remain. The overall context is more peaceful and stable compared to the last four months.
Some risks remain with regard to the military after the forced resignation of the 566
soldiers. Also, some points are important like the decisions on Article 37 of the
Constitution, which stipulate a limit of two five-year terms for the Presidency, and
governance reforms are still being implemented. The political and social crisis faced by
Burkina Faso in 2011 may have short-term adverse consequences, but the general trend is
positive.

22.     Expected economic growth in 2011 remains positive, but challenges remain.
The medium-term macroeconomic prospects are positive. Economic growth is
expected to average 5 percent between 2011 and 2015, due to higher cotton and gold
prices, a resilient services sector, and improved public investment in infrastructure.
Agricultural, mining and services will remain the pillars of the economy. The forecast is
for continued price stability over the medium-term, as inflation will remain in the low
single digits. In spite of spikes in 2011 with increases in food and fuel prices, the
projection is for annual inflation to reach the regional convergence criterion of 2 percent
on average. The fiscal position is projected to be sustainable as revenue increases will be
matched with expenditure increases to finance the new investment expenditures. On the
balance of payments side, the external current account deficit is forecast to widen to more


                                              8
than 5 percent of GDP as there will be strong domestic demand for imports, particularly
for capital goods.

23.     Despite the rebound in international prices and the introduction of a new producer
price, the recent social and political unrest and climate factors may have a negative
impact on the cotton sector this year.
                     Figure 6: World Cotton Prices ($US cents per pound)




24.     The delay in the arrival of the rainy season may have an adverse impact on
agricultural production, as nine out of thirteen regions of Burkina Faso show risk of
drought. However, the rise in international cotton prices for 2011 will benefit the cotton
sector over the next year (Figure 6). Despite some projected decline in 2012, the price of
cotton is still projected to remain above $ 1 per pound, much higher than the historical
average. The fiscal impact of reforming agricultural input markets will be significant in
the medium-term. According to estimates from the Permanent Secretariat in charge of
cotton sector reforms, bringing this year’s input prices back to last year’s price levels
would require approximately US$36 million in additional subsidy from the Government
while only US$7 million has been forecast in the budget law. While mining revenues
have been increasing due to favorable international prices, the challenge will be to use
these revenues to benefit local communities and create employment.

25.     The risk of debt distress in Burkina remains high, and there is a need for a
prudent debt policy. Results from the latest Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicate
that under current policies, the present value of debt-to- exports ratio would breach its
indicative threshold around 2026 in the baseline scenario and under stress tests. In the
baseline scenario of the DSA, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio is projected to increase
from 71 percent in 2011 to 114 percent by 2021, and 176 percent in 2031, well-above the
150 percent threshold. The narrow export base of Burkina suggests a need to maintain a
prudent borrowing policy, relying mostly on grants and highly concessional loans.
However, the DSA shows that the risk depends on a variety of factors and can be
mitigated by stronger export performance and more favorable financing terms. Some
flexibility in borrowing conditions under the current IMF/World Bank Debt Limits
Framework could help Burkina Faso obtain investment financing for implementing the
SCADD.

                                             9
26.    Overall, the macroeconomic policy framework is acceptable as there is sufficient
financing to fund the current account deficit. Economic growth is expected to be in line
with projections for 2011, while inflationary pressures will remain moderate. The
government has demonstrated commitment to fiscal discipline to consolidate recent
progress in fiscal sustainability and to support macroeconomic stability.           The
government recently implemented its economic and financial program under the IMF
Extended Credit Facility. The Third Review concluded satisfactorily in November, 2011.
The macroeconomic framework is adequate to support this operation.

Future Prospects and Outlook.

27.      Over the medium term, Burkina has a favorable growth prospects although
downside risks remain. The country is projected to have respectable growth, price
stability, and positive export performance from 2011 to 2015. Growth is expected to
remain in the range of more than 5 percent, but will remain reliant on volatile commodity
prices over the medium-term, economic growth is projected to remain strong, mostly
driven by agriculture, cotton, mining, and services sectors, as well as higher public
investment in infrastructure. Agriculture production will benefit from continued
implementation of measures aimed at supporting higher productivity and agricultural
food supply, although there will be challenges from a variable Sahelian climate. Mining
export revenue is projected to account for more than 70 percent of export revenue by
2015. Fiscal and monetary policies will remain prudent as the government will try to
ensure macroeconomic stability. There will be no anticipated major increases in
expenditures, but there will be a great focus on capital expenditure over the medium-
term. The current account deficit (incl. transfers) is projected to widen to more than 7
percent of GDP due to increase in capital goods for construction and oil imports. External
transfers in the magnitude of close to 4 percent of GDP are expected to continue to keep
the current account sustainable. However, volatility in international cotton prices,
decreases in gold prices, and an increase in oil prices could have an adverse effect on the
macroeconomic balance in the medium-run. The risk of debt distress, which remains
high, can be also hamper growth in the long-run.

Poverty Reduction
28.     Less than one year after the heavy floods of 2009, unusual rainfalls were
recorded again in 2010, affecting the living standards of many households. However
the exceptional level reached by cotton prices may have mitigated some of the
consequences of this natural disaster. The rainfall in July 2010 caused at least 16
deaths, and left 84,395 people homeless corresponding to 13,193 households. People
experienced considerable material damages and loss in livestock. In parallel, historically
good prices recorded for cotton this year should contribute to improve the subsistence
conditions of about 3 million people and mitigate the reduction of well-being of some of
those affected by floods. Macro-simulations forecast a 6.9 percent increase of income for
cotton producers in 2010. The good prices recorded for gold might also benefit some
households involved in traditional mining.

29.     The overall poverty rate seems to be decreasing, but it is rather unevenly
distributed over the population. Methodological issues make it difficult to compare
survey data from 2003 and 2009, but there is a general consensus of a poverty estimate of
44 percent in 2009 as well as a decline from 2003 to 2009. According to some evidence,
during 2003 – 2007, it was estimated that the share of population in poverty decreased by
around 7.9 percent at the national level. With the rebound in economic growth expected
with the implementation of the new strategy of socioeconomic development, the
government has retained its objective of achieving a poverty rate of 35 percent by 2015 in
the framework of the MDGs. According to the provisional results, poverty was reduced
in rural areas but increased in urban areas over the period 2003-2009. While this will
have reduced inequality, the government will have to tackle a growing phenomenon of
impoverishment in the urban areas.

30.     Access to basic services has improved thanks to increased public expenditure
and targeted social service provisions. Government spending on education, health,
water and sanitation has increased steadily, and the social sectors have been protected
even during budgetary shortfalls. During the period 2002 to 2010 budgetary allocations to
the education sector showed an upward trend as shown in Table 3 below. Budgetary
allocations to the sector increased from 15 percent in 2002 to 22 percent in 2008, but
dropped to 18 percent in 2009 rising again substantially to 22 percent in 2010, higher
than the 18.7% average or 19.1% median for SSA countries. The drop in allocations
shown for 2009 can be partly explained by the shift of resources to emergency
expenditures associated with the floods. In 2010, allocations to the sector started
increasing as in previous years. The priority given to education in the SCADD (new
PRSP) confirms the Government’s commitment to the education sector.

31.     Good progress was also made in the health and water sectors over the same
period. According to a national survey in 2009, underweight malnutrition has come
down from 35% to 26% and acute malnutrition dropped to 11% (21% in 2003) which is
category III (high). The trend of worsening malnutrition was reversed through political
recognition in 2003 and concerted action since 2006. Among the population 15-49 years
old, the prevalence rate is estimated at 1.2% (2009). However, the national prevalence is
estimated at 2.0%, with a higher prevalence in urban areas (3.1%). The HIV/AIDS
program received an enormous boost following a Presidential decree that made access to
ARV treatment free of charge since January 2010. As a result, the number of people on
ARV has now exceeded 30,000 compared to just 8,000 in 2005. Controlling and treating
epidemic diseases also had good results, thanks to prevention and public awareness
efforts and improved hygiene. Major progress has been made in increasing access to
drinking water, which now covers about two-thirds of the population.

32.     Nevertheless, there is still significant scope for improving the efficiency and
equity of public spending as well as the quality of services. Public finance
management reforms, stronger sector policies, and a new focus on social protection and
safety nets will all be crucial to further underpin human capital development and poverty
reduction. The recent Social Safety Nets (SSN) Review (2010) has shown that the scope
and coverage of the existing social safety net is too limited and that most interventions
are fairly small in scale and designed as temporary programs. On average, excluding fuel
subsidies, spending on social safety net programs was about 0.6 percent of GDP from
2005 to 2009, while about 20 percent of the population is food insecure and lives in
chronic poverty. Universal fuel subsidies are very expensive (0.7 percent of GDP in
2007) and have a very limited impact on the poorest decile (84 percent of the benefits go
to the non-poor). Among the remaining programs, food transfers are the main form of
social safety net programs in Burkina Faso, accounting for 69 percent of total SSN
spending and over 80 percent of all estimated SSN beneficiaries in 2009 (excluding fuel
subsidies). However, most of the financing for social safety net programs comes from
external and ad hoc resources.

33.      Despite progress in social indicators, Burkina Faso continues to remains near
the bottom of the Human Development Index. Despite improvements, Burkina Faso
still ranked 161 out of 169 countries in the UNDP Human Development Index (HDI)
2010 and dropped further to 181 out of 187 countries in 2011 according to the recently
published UNDP data. The evolution of the human development index remains slow

                                                       14
despite steady increase in social expenditures and institutional reforms. This is because in
large part the overall education level of the population remains low, with mean years of
schooling of 1.3 years per person whereas the average in the low HDI countries is about
4.1 years. In addition a high fertility rate of 6.2 children per women, a population growth
rate of 3.1 percent per year and an increase in life expectancy make it costlier to the
government to respond to the human development needs of a young population.

34.     Moreover, it is unlikely that the country will reach several important MDG
targets by 2015, such as halving the proportion of people with incomes less than US
$1.25 a day, ensuring completion of the primary education cycle for all children, and
eliminating gender disparity in primary and secondary education. The adult literacy rate
was only 28.7 percent in 2007, and the quality of education remains low. Health
outcomes for children and women have not shown any improvement: only 41 percent of
births were attended by trained medical personnel, the maternal mortality ratio was
estimated at a very high 700 per 100,000 child births, and infant mortality remained at
around or slightly above 100 per 1,000 child births between 2000 and 2008. Some
progress has been made in other areas, specifically those related to HIV prevalence, and
environmental sustainability. The SCADD highlights important delays in designing and
implementing sectoral programs and allocating adequate public resources, including at
the local level, which are critical to help achieve the MDGs, especially the ones where
progress has been slow (literacy rates, health and sanitation). In order to help improve
Burkina Faso’s human development indicators, the proposed series of operations would
directly target improved quality and equitable expansion of the education sector to
complement the current PRSC series which focus on growth rather than equity as well as
other IDA activities, which directly target reproductive health and improved social
service delivery.

35.      In order to address these issues, the government has been steadily improving
its budgetary process. Since 2002, the government has prepared a global Medium term
expenditure framework (MTEF) as the first step in the budget preparation process. The
global, top-down MTEF prepares sector envelopes for line ministries on the basis of
macro-economic projections and government priorities. The allocations of the MTEF are
in line with the SCADD priorities as the government devotes a large share of the
discretionary budget to priority sectors. The implementation of the MTEF allows Burkina
Faso to be responsive to changing fortunes as well as to translate growth and poverty
priorities in the annual budget. The MTEF has brought substantial changes in budget
allocations by introducing effective rules-based criteria and promoting pro-poor
spending. Under the MTEF, the priority sectors are rural development, environment,
justice, health and basic education. The priority sectors receive 60 percent of overall
additional resources, with basic education and health receiving 50 percent of resources
allocated to priority sectors.
36.     The main elements of forward budget planning are in place. Sector strategies
have been developed for sectors representing 40 percent of primary expenditures and
related costing is comprehensive for each strategy, in order to complement the top-down,
MTEF approach. They display three-year program-budgets that are built with information
provided by the ministries and are consistent with the expenditure projections on a yearly

                                            15
basis. To improve the budget process and ensure alignment between the budget and
policy priorities, Burkina started, in 2010 with support from donor community, to
implement program budgeting by the creation of a Technical Secretariat in charge of
piloting and monitoring the reform program in line with WAEMU recent PFM
Directives. To this end, 16 ministries have been selected for the 2011 program budget
preparation with the aim to fully cover the remaining ministries by 2015. The budget is
formulated through systemic consultations with spending ministries and the National
Assembly, adhering to a fixed budget calendar.

III. THE GOVERNMENT’S TEN-YEAR BASIC EDUCATION
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY
PROCESSES
Basic Education Sector Issues
37.     Despite progress made in the recent past, Burkina Faso continues to have
some of the lowest education indicators in the region. These comparatively low returns
to investments in education in Burkina are partly related to the need for the introduction
of policy and institutional reforms that would help improve the operational efficiency of
the system. The key issues in the education sector are: (i) inadequate and inequitable
access to education, particularly for the poor; (ii) low quality and mismatch between
curriculum and the needs of local economy; (iii) inadequate financing of education and
inefficient use of resources; and (iv) weak sector management. One area of particular
concern is the participation of girls in the education system. Despite recent progress
access to all levels of education through the implementation of the ten-year education
program (2001-2011), girls' education is hampered by various socio-cultural and
economic factors as well as by the organization of schools and training. This under-
education of girls and women has negative consequences on the lives of women at the
individual and collective level, but also deprives the country of some of its economic
development potential.

Access and Equity

38.     Primary Education: Although the gross primary enrollment rate (GER)
increased by 7.5 percentage points per year on average since 2000 to reach 77.6 percent
in 2010, this rate is unlikely to allow Burkina to achieve universal primary education
(UPE) by 2015. Current government projections suggest that UPE will be achieved in
2020. The primary education completion rate in 2010 was only 52 percent compared to
the Sub Saharan average of 70% even in 2006/2007. The low enrollment and completion
rates are partly the result of very low internal efficiency. Improvements in curriculum and
teaching are having an impact as substantial progress is being made to improve internal
efficiency with repetition rates declining from 17.5 percent in 2004 to 7.25 percent in
2010 and drop-out rates also improving over the same period from 17% to 11.7%,
although the rate remains high.



                                            16
39.     Access to primary education is also inequitable although the gender gap is
narrowing. From 1999 to 2009 the proportion of girls in primary education increased
from 35% to 44.8% in 2007 and further to 47.2% in 2010. The gap between the 48
poorest performing Communes and the rest of the country continues to be a concern1.
Despite the progress in narrowing the gender gap, experience suggests that, in addition to
resources, a combination of structural factors constrains household incomes, and cultural
practices ̶ especially in difficult geographic areas ̶ cannot be addressed by existing
policies and strategies. Some of the remaining differentials between boys and girls would
therefore require targeted policy interventions to achieve equity.

40.      The reason for the low and inequitable enrollment rates are related to both
demand and supply factors. Demand side factors include unaffordable costs of
education to households such as informal school fees, costs of textbooks and other
teaching materials as well as the opportunity costs of education. On the supply side, long
distances to school, poor quality physical facilities and an inappropriate school calendar
are key factors which adversely affect access. The direct and indirect costs of education
are still prohibitive for some families, especially for those in low income areas. Primary
education is free, but the subsidies provided by the Government are inadequate to cover
the costs of a good quality education. Schools therefore continue to impose unregulated
fees on students, which some parents find unaffordable.

41.     On the supply side, the Country Status Report shows the gross enrollment
and admission rates become progressively lower as the proportion of children who live
45 or more minutes away from a school rises. This is particularly true for girls in rural
areas, who are considered to be at greater risk when they have to travel long distances on
isolated roads. Poor physical facilities also limit access to education. Many primary
schools are overcrowded because they are run in temporary structures with inappropriate
architectural designs and low quality construction. The practice of biennial school intake
in sparsely populated areas also restricts access to school. Under BEPSG 1 and 2 the
Government began addressing this through introduction of multigrade teaching and
expansion of school construction and results are promising as summarized in annex1.

42.    Secondary Education: The shortage of secondary school places is even more
severe. The surge in primary education enrollment and completion rates has increased
the need to accommodate graduates at the lower secondary level. In 2010, out of the
253,553 students completing primary education, more than 119,000 students, mainly
from rural areas, were unable to enter secondary education. The secondary level as a
whole has experienced only modest progress in enrollment growth during the period:
GER increased slowly between 1999 and 2004, and picked up with support from the IDA
financed Post Primary Education project launched in 2006, to reach 29.90 percent in
2010 (32.30 % in lower secondary and 10.70% in upper secondary). The GER for lower
secondary education continues to be on an upward trend. However, reforms are needed to
increase enrolment in quality secondary education to support the growth objectives
defined in the current PRS.


1
    The Gross Enrollment Rate in these 48 Communes is 43.7%, with 44.9% for boys and 42.4% for girls in 2010.

                                                          17
43.    Internal efficiency in lower secondary education is lower than for primary
education and has remained unchanged over the past few years. For the 10 years
preceding 2006/7, the repetition rate fell by less than 3 percentage points from 28.4% to
25.9% and has continued at this level until 2010. It takes 9.5 years on average to produce
a lower secondary school graduate (the level consists of xxx grades); 2.4 times longer
than necessary. This imposes an additional average cost of 51% to produce a low
secondary school graduate.

44.     The opportunity and direct costs of secondary education are higher than for
primary education. Therefore, parents have to make significant investments/sacrifices
to enroll their children in secondary school. Thus, parents’ propensity to withdraw their
children from school if they judge the quality of education to be low or if the child is not
making good progress is higher than in primary education. Reforms are needed at this
level to improve quality and increase internal efficiency to provide an incentive for
increased participation in the system.

Low Quality and Relevance of Education

45.    The quality of education is low, although evidence in this area has been
limited due to lack of reliable national student assessment data. However, the basic
education sector is building its students learning assessment system. In 2006 and 2010,
two national assessments were piloted at the primary level with external support, but the
national systems still need to be strengthened. Overall, the pilots indicated no progress in
learning outcomes from 2006 to 2010 in Math and French. Students’ performance at
grade 2 and 5, both in French and Math remained weak (average score for both ranging
between 40 and 54 out of 100). Although examinations pass rates are not reliable
instruments for measuring learning outcomes because they often serve to filter students
for the next level of education, they could be used as a proxy to measure quality,
especially at the lower levels. Examination results show that pass rates were only 66% in
2010.

46.    Low quality in primary education can be explained by in part by low
learning time, limited school inputs and teacher effectiveness. There is also some
disconnect between the curriculum and the needs of the economy. The instructional time
in primary and especially secondary education is lower than internationally accepted
norms. It is even lower than the nationally prescribed time due to unauthorized school
closings, inefficient bureaucratic procedures and practices and absences and tardiness of
students and teachers. These factors dramatically limit student-teacher interaction and
learning opportunities. The quality of learning time is also adversely affected by a
shortage of textbooks and other instructional materials. Low quality of education is
worsened by the shortage of qualified teachers, particularly in science and math. Reforms
are needed to increase the amount and use of learning time, to improve teacher
management and to make textbooks and teaching materials more easily available.

47.    The current curriculum focuses on preparing students for secondary
education followed by tertiary education, with little focus on skills development. A
good proportion of students who exit the system at the primary or secondary levels are
                                            18
denied marketable skills. This limits the returns to investments in these students and
constitutes missed opportunities for producing better trained manpower that could help
increase individual incomes and promote economic growth.

48.     There is no recent study of labor market skill shortages in Burkina. However, it is
acknowledged that skills in the areas of building trades, metal work, science and
technology are in short supply in the economy. There is a shortage of skills to match the
construction boom, and technology has advanced to the extent that even the simplest
household equipment, motor cycles and cars are increasingly being computerized and
require some exposure to science and technology for proper maintenance and repair. This
advance in technology is making it increasingly difficult for school leavers and informal
sector labor without basic skills in these areas to find suitable employment. Repair and
maintenance of equipment has been a significant part of the informal sector so unless
these challenges are addressed, growth can be adversely affected. Burkina also has
ambitions to become the technology hub of the sub-region given its limited supply of
natural resources and difficult geographic and climatic conditions. The aim therefore is to
provide students with basic concepts in science and technology and to help train the labor
force in core basic skills that could be used in a broad range of enterprises. The emphasis
on apprenticeship is to allow enterprises to train youths with these skills to meet their
specific needs.

49.      Since the system for assessing learning outcomes is yet to be fully developed,
it is difficult to determine how well the system is performing from one year to the next or
even in comparison with other countries in the region. In addition the absence of a fully
developed assessment system reduces the opportunity to analyze learning weaknesses
that could help inform the teaching/learning process. This capacity is being further
developed to help improve the pedagogical management of the system.

Weak Management of Education

50.    Although the government is making every effort to finance the education and
training system, the resources are inadequate given the needs and over-
centralization of management leading to a number of inefficiencies. The Government
increased budgetary expenditures on the education sector from 3.6% of GDP in 2000 to
4.7% of GDP in 20072 and 2008. However, the share fell to 4.1% in 2009 due to the
shocks during that period and then recovered to 4.5% in 2010. This trend shows that the
government is keeping allocations to levels well above the 3.5% recommended in the
GPE framework, and the 4.7% share is above the 4.6% median share of education in
GDP for SSA, IDA and FTI countries as well as world-wide median. Although the 4.5%
for 2010 is lower than the referenced median, allocations in the medium term are
expected rise again to the 4.7% level or higher in the future. High priority is put on
investments in the sector as Burkina allocates 43.9% of these expenditures to investment
expenditures and ranks second in the world in this respect.

51.     Much of this increase was allocated to primary education, but this is not
enough to meet the current needs for this level of education because of the large share
allocated to salaries and inefficiencies in the system. The share of primary education
increased from 57% of the recurrent budget for education in 1996 to 62% in 2007, then
dropped to 58%3 in 2008 and then rose again to 65% in 2009 but fell to 62% in 2010.
The levels recorded for the recent past are above the parameters set in the GPE
framework, and Burkina ranks highest in Africa and sixth in the world regarding the
share of per capita income it spends on primary education, 29.2%. However, only about
10% of these expenditures were allocated to educational materials. Sixty-five percent was
allocated to salaries and 30% for transfers.

52.     To protect these expenditures, a software tool, “Circuit Informatisé de la
Dépense? has been used since 2002 to decentralize budget management and track
public expenditures in line ministries such as education, health and water. This tool
provides data used by the government and partners to monitor allocations to these sectors
based on the matrix of performance criteria used by donors for disbursement of general
and sector budgets for each fiscal year. In addition, the government has set up a treasury
committee lead by MEF to mobilize and allocate resources equitably for the social
sectors, to monitor social sector budget execution and to protect these sectors during
periods of shock. Allocation of resources within the sector to address any distortions is
carried out by the joint government/donor collaboration in the preparation of annual
action plans that are reviewed twice a year. The measures to increase expenditures on
textbooks and teaching materials are part of the interventions being made to increase
expenditures on non-salary expenditures and this should result in a reduced share of
salaries and transfers in education expenditures in the short to medium term.

53.      In addition, inefficiencies are observed in the use of resources. At the primary
level, 25% of the staff are not teachers and this rises to 39% at the secondary level. The
level of salaries based on multiples of GDP per capita is also relatively high compared to
those in the region. At the primary level, average teacher salaries are 5.3 times GDP per
capita compared to 4.4 for the region and 3.5 recommended by the GPE framework.
Similarly, the average teacher salary in first and second cycles of secondary education
are 8.8 and 9.6 times GDP per capita respectively compared to an average of 6.6% for
both cycles in the region. It is not clear to what extent these high salaries are generated by
a relatively high cost of living in a landlocked economy which relies largely on imports.

54.     Management of the system is also over centralized, making it difficult to
ensure efficient utilization of resources at the lower levels of administration, including
schools. As a result, the impact of resources provided in the central budget at the school
level is limited. One of the major inefficiencies related to this is the inequitable
distribution of teachers. According to the CSR, 22% of the teachers in primary education
are not allocated in accordance with the number of students. At the same time central
administration of the system forces teachers to absent themselves from schools to obtain
decisions on routine matters. At the secondary level there is a wide disparity among

3
 This was due to the unusual increase in the post primary budget at the start of 2008 with the start of the 15
billion FCFA post-primary project financed by Netherlands and IDA.

                                                     20
regions in the number of hours taught, and there are serious teacher shortages in some
subjects such as science and math. Teacher accountability is reduced since attendance
and performance is not monitored at the local level.

55.     The education sector is one of the priority sectors in the government’s
decentralization program. However, there are significant challenges that need to be
addressed to fully implement this policy. First among these is weak capacity in the
communes and in the education administration at local levels. A school based
management system could be an effective approach to improve capacity in the short-
term, but there is still a need to expand the COGES, to clearly define their roles and to
put in place the organizational and management systems within which they would
function. The aim would be to integrate the COGES into the decentralized structures to
work with communes to manage school level resources and carry-out oversight functions
that cannot be efficiently carried out by communes. Resolving the capacity and political
economy issues at the commune level would require substantial amounts of time,
resources and political will. Experience in other countries has shown that quick positive
results can be achieved at the school level if beneficiaries are involved in the delivery of
services. Pilots in this respect have been carried out with some success in Burkina Faso
and there is a new JICA financed project aimed at taking this approach to scale.

Objectives of the Ten-Year Basic Education Development Program
56.    The Government is addressing these issues through the PDDEB, especially
those related to equitable access and quality. The main objectives of the government’s
Ten-Year Basic Education Development Program (PDDEB), which is summarized in
Annex 3, are to raise the educational level and diversify the skills of the labor force to
help promote equitable economic growth.

Description of the Ten-Year Basic Education Development Program
57.     Burkina Faso has adopted a number of reforms in response to the
constraints in basic education. The priority in basic education is to fully operationalize
the principles of compulsory and free public education. Specifically, the aim is to create
greater coherence in the curriculum between grades and cycles and to reform education
and training to increase the employability of youths by establishing links between non-
formal and formal general and technical education and vocational training. To promote
girls education, a key priority, the program consists of various strategies and specific
measures funded by the Government and development partners to address the limited
access of girls and women to education. These actions have helped to reduce the
education gap between boys and girls, but gender parity is yet to be achieved.

58.     To increase the synergy of actions aimed at improving multisectoral participation
of women in social, economic and cultural development, the government intensified its
interventions on girls/women’s education by consolidating and expanding all the diverse
actions undertaken previously into a national gender strategy that was adopted in 2009.
This strategy is included in the SCADD and cuts across all sectors. The strategy provides,
inter alia, measures for improved access and monitoring of men and women to basic
social services in a fair and equitable manner. As part of the strategy a ministry for

                                            21
women’s affairs was created to exercise oversight of all issues and programs related to
the roles and the participation of girls and women in the development process. Programs
for enhancing girls and women’s participation in education is thus well integrated in
strategies at both the sectoral level and at the Ministry for promotion of Women’s affairs.

59.     Consistent with this, programs have been implemented at each level of the
education sector, ranging from basic education to higher education, including TVET, to
address the key issues related to girls education and training including demand and
supply constraints to increasing access and retention, as well as the achievement of girls
in the system. Specifically, the reforms in PDDEB include the following:

60.     Pre-School Education reforms aim to revise the policy and institutional
framework for pre-school education to permit further development of a community based
approach in partnership with public sector pre-school centers. A regulatory framework is
also planned to encourage private sector participation in pre-school provision while
ensuring minimum standards of quality. This would help reduce the costs of pre-school
education on the government budget while helping to meet the objective of expanding
coverage from 2.1% in 2006 to 8.3% in 2015. The target is for communities to increase
their share of coverage from 24% in 2006 to 73% in 2015.

61.    Primary Education– reforms aim to introduce policies and regulations detailed in
annex 3 to facilitate better utilization of school places, increased availability and
performance of teachers, increased supply of schools, textbooks including learning
materials and improved management of the education system. The learning assessment
system is also being strengthened. Particular emphasis is placed on rural areas and
provision for children with special needs, girls and the poor.

62.      Specific actions to address gender issues in primary education include: (i) the
adaptation of school facilities, including separate latrines for girls, (ii) the establishment
of satellite schools with three classrooms in villages to reduce distance to schools, with a
quota system of 50% female students where possible, (iii) the creation of Mothers for
Education Associations (MEAs) in all schools to support the enrollment and retention of
girls in school;(iv) the removal of the annual financial contribution of girls to school
funds, (v) the distribution of school kits to girls, (vi) the distribution of food rations to
girls, (vii) teacher training and community awareness to reduce the effects of stereotypes
and (viii) the organization of literacy classes adapted to a schedule convenient for
women.

63.     Reforms in private education are also planned to increase its share, which has
been relatively low especially in upper secondary education. From 2002 to 2010, the
number of private schools increased from 776 to 1,965 accounting for 13% and 18% of
the total number of schools respectively. The scope for provision of private primary
education is mainly in urban areas where the population has relatively higher access to
monetary resources and incomes. Due to poverty that is more widespread in rural areas
and the need to stimulate demand in some of these areas, the government made the
strategic decision to stress the development of private primary education in urban zone.

                                             22
Towards this end, the Government policy reform program includes the revision of
education norms, including those related to school construction with a view to
stimulating the participation of the private sector in expanding the education system.
However, this does not include private primary education in rural areas where the need
for expansion is greatest. Poverty in these areas limits the demand response to this
strategy in these areas. The objective for 2020 is therefore to maintain the current share of
private schools in the rural areas.

Lower Secondary Education and Secondary Vocational Education Training
64.    The Government has embarked on a major reform program for first and
second cycle secondary education and technical education and vocational training.
Specific measures are designed to achieve the following objectives: (i) improve
management of the transition from primary to first cycle secondary education; (ii) reduce
overcrowding and (iii) ensure class sizes that allow provision of quality secondary
education. The policy of free education is also to be gradually extended to first cycle
secondary education to increase access; also management of schools will be strengthened
to ensure quality improvement and efficiency.

65.     Priority is to be given to underserved areas and vulnerable groups. Strategies
to promote girls education include:(i)the creation of small schools in rural areas to reduce
distance travelled to school, (ii) free distribution of school kits to girls, especially those
from disadvantaged backgrounds; (iii) school canteen subsidy for girls from
disadvantaged backgrounds, (iv) psychological training for girls to increase their self-
confidence; (v) training of teachers on gender issues; (vi) tutoring of girls in certain
subjects such as Math and Science, especially those in difficulty, (vii) appointment and
training of focal points in all regions for counseling/guidance of girls and (viii)
organization of sex education for girls during the school holidays.

66.     Vocational training is to be reorganized to introduce short courses, some based on
apprenticeship adapted to labor market needs. The main thrust of the reforms is to
establish structures for short-term and or apprenticeship training in partnership with
master craftsmen and other accredited businesses. A specific initiative is being introduced
with the support of the private sector for the training of graduates of first cycle secondary
general education. This would permit establishment of a capacity for short-term courses
and training attachments for 50,000 youths by 2015. It is expected that in the medium to
long-term, these measures would help to absorb 40% of primary school graduates
annually in first cycle secondary general education and vocational training.

67.     Secondary general education reforms would permit provision of high quality
education especially science education and technical/professional training. The
regulations for private provision of secondary education are to be revised to increase their
participation and provide incentives for the development of applied and scientific
research.

68.   Initiatives to support girls include counseling and guidance provided by the
Department responsible for girls’ education and an NGO comprised of women

                                             23
scientists. The NGO promotes the enrollment of girls in science courses. Despite the
progress made, the proportion of girls in higher education remains limited, accounting for
only 33% of the total number of students enrolled in 2010-2011.

69.     The provision of private secondary education continues to increase to satisfy
unmet needs. From 2002 to 2010, the proportion of pupils enrolled in lower secondary
private education more than quadrupled rising from 9% to 41%. The share of the private
sector in upper secondary education is much higher but the increase at this level was
more modest, increasing from 41% in 2002 to 48.9% in 2009. The government’s
objective is to increase the contribution of the private sector to secondary education to
50%. Given the constraints of limited access to cash incomes in rural areas where the
need for expanding secondary education is higher, the government will encourage the
private sector to invest in urban areas. The proposed incentives for private sector
expansion in this area comprise the construction of schools for private promoters in urban
areas such as those tested in Bank financed Post-Basic Education Project. By supporting
the expansion of private sector education to meet the demands of the urban population,
the government expects to mobilize more public, donor and NGO resources, to increase
the supply of education in rural areas.

70.     Adult and non-formal education, reforms include establishment of new and
alternative approaches to the provision of adult education including the “le Faire faire?
model at decentralized levels. These and other interventions are expected to promote
acquisition of basic education skills by out of school youth and adults and are expected to
have a positive effect on socio-economic development.

71.    Pre-service teacher training policy is being redesigned to change the
requirements for entry, the duration and contents of the program as well as the balance
between theory and practice, thus preparing teachers to teach the new curricula, which is
focused on greater coherence between primary and secondary education.

72.     The Government’s matrix of proposed policy and institutional reforms is guiding
the implementation of the sector program and is shown as annex 3. BEPSG 1-3 have
been supporting the implementation of the program and critical measures in the
Government’s matrix have been selected as the prior actions for the three operations.
Progress in implementing the Sector Program
73.     Implementation of the first phase of the PDDEB started in 2002, with the
support of development partners within the context of the GPE, and was completed in
2007; the second phase started in the same year. Good progress has been made in
implementing the reform program including in the following areas that were not covered
by BEPSG 1-3. First, the government has implemented its policy of expanding the
provision of community based pre-schools and is advocating the inclusion of pre-school
education in the budgets of local authorities. As a result, provision of preschools by the
private sector dropped from 72% in 2007/08to just over 47% in 2008/09 largely in urban
areas. To ensure quality, the pre-school curricula are being revised and teacher
supervisors and teachers are being trained for pre-school run by communities. The sale
of textbooks for pre-schools has also been decentralized to increase availability to

                                            24
schools. These interventions have helped enrollment in pre-school education to rise by an
annual average of about 28% from 12,057 in 2000-01 to 43,165 in 2009-10.

74.     At the primary level the government has implemented a number of reforms
especially with regard to the enrolment of girls. Public subsidies for girls in first
grade primary education were increased to 189,981 in 2009-10 from 143,333 in 2008-09.
In addition, the government and partners provided support for the association of mothers
(AMEs) supporting education which helped increase the number of these organizations
from 50 in 2007-2008 to 62, in 2008-09 and 315 in 2009-10, reaching a grand total of
427 AMEs. This has re-energized the AMEs and in turn has resulted in increased
enrollment of girls in the beneficiary schools and promoted greater involvement of AMEs
in school management.

75.     Access, retention, success and protection of girls in school are also being
supported through the establishment and expansion of monitoring clubs. The
number of these clubs increased from 20 in 2007-08 to 97 in 2009-10. School
lunchrooms have been expanded to cover from 972,000 students in 4,873 schools to over
1 million in 5524 schools and this is further helping to increase access and retention.
Policy reforms to expand private sector participation in primary education has resulted in
an increase in enrollment in private schools by an annual average of 13.9% between
2007-08 and 2010-11, raising the share of the private sector in the sub-sector from 13.1%
to almost 15% during the same period. To improve quality, the curricula are being
enriched with the introduction of emergent themes such as environmental studies and
education citizenship, and improved national capacity for authoring and production of
textbooks for both primary and post-primary education is being pursued to ensure regular
availability of these materials at affordable prices.

76.     These actions have also led to substantial progress in girls' education. For
example, for the period 2005-2010, the number of girls in primary schools increased from
614,810 to 1,041,511, an increase of 70% in five years. The parity indexreached0.93.
Over the same period, the completion rate for girls increased from 28.5% to 49.1% and a
reduction of the gap with boys was about 4 percentage points. In non-formal education,
the number of women attending literacy centers more than doubled in 9 years from
61,198 in 2002 to 124,494 in 2010.Women made up over 60% of those enrolled in
literacy centers in 2010.

77.     Post primary education is being promoted through sensitization sessions
especially with regard to girls’ retention in these schools and promotion of private sector
participation. The interventions to promote girls education in secondary education cited
above have resulted in improved girls’ participation in secondary education. In the first
cycle of secondary education, the number of girls increased from108,469 in 2005 to
221,080 in 2010,an increase of 104% in 5 years. The completion rate for girls in the first
cycle also increased from 10% (12% for the national average) to 14.3% (17.5%for the
national average) over the same period.




                                            25
78.    In upper secondary education, the number of girls increased by 65%, from 23.472
in 2005 to 38,678 in 2010. The completion rate in this cycle has almost doubled for girls
from 3.9% in 2006 to 6% in 2011, with an average completion rate of 8%.

79.     Interventions at this level to promote private education consist of inclusion of
private sector teachers and teacher supervisors in teacher training conferences and in-
service training as well as provision of textbooks and teacher guides. Student teachers
from private teacher training colleges are also allowed in public sector practice schools.

80.     Despite these measures, the share of the private sector in post-primary education
remained around 40.5% between 2008-09 and 2009-10. This stabilization follows a
period during which the private sector grew faster than the public sector as a result of the
decision to include evening class students in the private sector enrollment and the
decision to provide scholarships for students who pass the examinations to enroll in
private schools.

81.     Further development of TEVT is being promoted through residential, sandwich,
in-service and modular training. Modular training has been introduced for apprentices,
managers and workers in industry in the areas of building trades, metal work including
aluminum and carpentry. The French language curricula for the third and fourth years
have been adapted to the requirements for TVET and physical sciences, and the teacher
guides have been updated to match the revised curricula.

82.     Private sector participation is also being promoted and this has allowed private
sector training of 8,602 youths in 2010 an increase of 11.7% from 7,705 in 2009 and
5490 in 2008.An external evaluation of the PDDEB showed that substantial progress had
been made especially in terms of access to education as shown in Table 3. These
achievements continued in 2008 and 2010 during phase two implementation of the
PDDEB.

83.     The external evaluation of the 2000 – 2007 PDDEB I benefitted from discussions
carried out during the 2007 joint government/LDG education sector review and the
national consultations on the status of education including options for the reform of the
education system. The results of the evaluation and consultations formed the basis for
drafting and approving the 2007 Education Law, and led to a national consensus on the
purpose and role of education in Burkina as well as on the key priority areas in the sector
during the 7 years from 2008 to 2015. The PDDEB II (2008-2011) introduced further
reforms for the development of basic education while maintaining focus on quality and
improving management of the sector. The PDDEB II also aims at improving the quality
and relevance of the curriculum and increased retention at all levels. Achieving these
qualitative and quantitative objectives require reforms in the administrative, fiduciary and
pedagogical management of the system to optimize utilization of resources.
Implementation of the reform program in BEPSG 1- 3 is helping to achieve the objectives
of PDDEB II. However, it is clear from various evaluations of the interventions related
to gender that the current rate of progress will not result in Burkina achieving the goal of
parity between girls -boys by 2015. An updated national strategy for accelerating girls'

                                            26
education with deeper reforms is therefore in the process of being approved for
implementation between 2012 and 2020. It builds on lessons learned from the decade of
implementation of policy of girls’ education. The main objective is to achieve gender
parity during this period.

84.     Participatory Processes Stakeholders’ consultation. Experience with the first
generation of PRSPs in Burkina Faso showed that consultations with civil society
organizations was not systematic and that impacted negatively on the program
achievements, including in the education sector. The joint annual review of the education
sector plan implementation held in September 2003 which involved teachers’ unions, also
made the same observations and recommended regular involvement of teacher’ unions,
students and parent/teacher’ associations in these reviews. Since that review, stakeholder
and civil society consultations have become systematic in the education sector.
Preparation of the second phase of PDDEB (2006-2011) was carried out in this
participatory manner. Teachers’ unions and students’ parent/teacher associations are now
involved in early stages of program preparation, from analysis of sector issues to plan
approval and implementation. For example, during preparation of the national policy on
secondary education, a national workshop was organized from August, 24-29, 2009, to
discuss and confirm the conclusions of the analytical work. Five networks of teachers’
unions, students and parent/teacher associations as well as other civil society
organizations participated in the process. This workshop concluded a set of regional
consultative workshops with all stakeholders, including teachers. Following the joint
acceptance of the results of the analytical work the national policy was prepared and
formally approved at a national workshop involving different stakeholders including

 2008 indicators are calculated based on 2006 census data except for those relating to Pupil/teacher ratio
and number of classrooms built per year which are derived from school administrative data.

which teachers’ unions on November 5, 2010. This approval was the culmination of an
approval process that included regional stakeholders consultations held during October
2010.

85.     More specifically, the following are examples of involvement of and
consultations with civil society, particularly teacher representatives, in the design of the
sector program, including examination of a variety of policy options from which the prior
actions for the IDA-supported BEPSG operations were selected, and in the adoption of
the sector program policy options and arrangements for implementation. To facilitate
this process the following monitoring arrangements were put in place:

(i) The PDDEB Board Meeting chaired by the prime minister, is generally held in June
    each year, to assess implementation progress, to discuss and adopt annual sector
    strategic priorities and to agree on key recommendations for the future. Participants
    at this Board Meeting include civil society, notably teachers’ unions, students’
    parents associations, and Mayors from representative communes, ministries
    responsible for Education and donor partner representatives. In October 2008, the
    PDDEB Board discussed and approved the key reforms in the program, including
    those related to the BEPSG operations, and endorsed the request to the FTI
    Secretariat.

(ii) Joint Reviews: Two principal sessions are organized annually to assess progress
     toward reaching the PDDEB objectives (April-May) and policy outcomes, as well as
     to identify policy measures and possible conditions for future support (October-
     November). The results of these consultations also feed into the national PRSP
     report on the sector and inform the budget allocations for the ensuing year. Teachers’
     unions and Parent/teacher associations are institutionally participants in these
     reviews as stated in Government PDDEB M&S rules. The participants in the joint
     reviews make recommendations on program implementation and policy reforms to
     be monitored by thematic working groups. The series of BESPG 1-3 and associated
     policy reforms were discussed and approved with civil society participation during
     joint reviews held in December, 2008, April 2009 and April 2010. With regard to the
     policy measures, teachers’ unions focused mainly on multi-grade classrooms
     expansion, monitoring of teachers’ time on task and reform of regulations regarding
     students’ repetition. They made the following specific comments and
     recommendations on the design and implementation of these reforms to help
     increase the chances of success: (i) include teacher training and information
     campaigns to sensitize teachers and parents about multi-grade teaching, (ii) carry-out
     an extensive information campaign on reducing repetition rates and (iii) fully inform
     teachers about the objectives of monitoring teachers’ time on task. The approved
     reform program incorporated these recommendations and they were reflected in the
     reformulation of associated policy measures. For the secondary education program,
     as a follow up consultative meeting was organized in November 2011 with civil
     society on the theme of monitoring teachers’ time on task. The monitoring report
     prepared during the school year 2010-2011 was presented and further actions were
     agreed to reinforce the system.

                                            28
(iii) Joint Monthly meetings: The main objectives of these meetings are to monitor
      implementation progress of the PDDEB, including the reform program. Civil
      society, particularly teachers’ unions and parents’ associations participate in these
      meetings where all stakeholders, including civil society and donor partners are
      regularly informed about the status of the various reforms and participate in the
      reformulation of the prior actions for donor-financed operations if needed.

(iv) The thematic groups and associated sub groups in each region of the country, focus
     on specific issues of the program (access, quality, sector management and fiduciary
     management). Government representatives, partners and civil society members are
     included in these groups, which meet regularly to monitor implementation and
     progress in carrying-out the recommendations of the joint annual reviews on the
     various themes. During the November 2011 meeting of the access group for
     Secondary education, a decision was made to organize further information
     campaigns throughout the 13 regions starting December 20, 2011 to raise teachers’
     awareness on how to implement the new policy on repetition while maintaining the
     quality improvement agenda. The campaign is being jointly organized by the
     Ministry, teachers’ unions and student parents association.

86.     This consultative process was maintained in the preparation of the PDDEB II
(2012-2020). Teachers’ unions as well as other civil society organizations are members
of thematic groups which are responsible for preparing the three components of the
program, notably access, quality, and sector management including fiduciary
management. A schedule for program preparation and approval including the various
participatory steps outlined above which now characterize the system is available.


IV. WORLD BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S
PROGRAM
LINK TO THE CAS

87.     BEPSG 1-3 were designed to support the priorities in the Government’s SCADD
and help achieve the strategic objectives of the CAS for the period 2010 – 2012 which
was endorsed in August 10, 2009. The SCADD includes the following priorities: (i)
reinforcement of access to quality basic education, (ii) development of post-primary,
secondary and higher education, (iii) promotion of technical education and vocational
training and (iv) the continued fight against HIV/AIDS and STDs.

88.     To support the government’s strategy, the CAS is framed around the following
two strategic objectives and two cross cutting themes:

89.    Strategic theme one: Minimizing economic vulnerability and promoting growth
through economic transformation. Strategic theme two: Promoting shared growth
through improved social service delivery. Cross-cutting issues: Weak institutional and
human capacity and rapid population growth.
                                            29
90.     The proposed Grant is an integral part of the FY10-12 CAS. It aims at assisting
Burkina Faso to transform its economy by improving the relevance of secondary and
vocational training, supporting equitable and shared growth and making progress on
human development by improving the quality of education services for the poor regions.
The reforms supported by this operation harness the Government’s commitment to
improved governance and enhanced public participation and aim at improving social
service delivery. The Grant adopts new ways of doing business, which involve better
positioning the country’s development in a regional context; strengthening analytical
support and developing results-focused approaches to the development of the education
and training sector.

91.     BEPSG- 1- 3 support CAS Theme One by helping to raise the overall level of
education of the population, especially disadvantaged groups, to participate in and
generate economic growth, and thereby raise incomes. BEPSG- 3 will help establish the
foundation for increased employment and diversified growth through reforms related to
raising the quality and relevance of technical education and vocational training to
promote coherence between the training programs and the needs of the labor market.

92.     BEPSG-3 will also directly support strategic Theme Two, which aims at
increasing access to quality social services, as well as the objectives of PRS pillars 2 and
4 by increasing access to quality primary and first cycle secondary education. BEPSG-3
will also help, better manage population growth and promote good governance through
strengthening technical and administrative management of the education system.




                                            30
COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

93.    IMF and World Bank staffs have coordinated closely on the identification of
the respective institutions’ areas of focus. The IMF finalized the First Review under the
Three-Year Arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility and Request for a Waiver of
Non-observance Criterion on November 4, 2010. IMF and World Bank staff are assisting
the authorities in the implementation of the country’s SCADD, providing them with
technical assistance on areas such as resource mobilization and budget management and
education sector policies and programs. This collaboration has continued following the
recent demonstrations to help the government introduce reforms and investment
programs to respond to the crisis within an acceptable fiscal framework.

94.     Twenty seven donors currently support the implementation of the
Government’s SCADD through various modes of assistance: general budget support
(GBS), sector programs, investments operations, capacity building operations and
technical assistance. Investment financing accounts for two-thirds of external aid, while
budget support accounts for approximately one-third of total donor support. Currently,
nine donors support the joint CGAB on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding
(MoU) signed in 2005. Donors have progressively moved into a joint Performance
Assessment Framework (CGAB Matrix) which includes policy actions and performance
indicators for monitoring progress.

95.    Joint development of the Government’s PDDEB as required by the GPE
framework enabled the sector ministries to strengthen harmonization among development
partners. Following the successful harmonization of major donor policies around the
Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) in 2005, Local Donor Group (LDG) coordination in
the education sector was strengthened through participation of all donors in the cadre
partenarial and the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that governs
collaboration on all aspects of the program.

96.    Most partners in the education sector, eleven in all, focus their support for the
education sector on the government’s education sector plan using budget support through
a common fund, the CAST. A few others provide direct investment financing. In 2010,
the CAST partners pledged 13.8 billion FCFA and 89.3%, or 12.3 billion FCFA, was
disbursed. Total resources in the CAST for 2010 were 13.2 billion FCFA5 and
expenditures amounted to almost 11.0 billion FCFA, representing an absorption rate of
about 83%. Table 4 below shows the distribution of these expenditures by PDDEB
components.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER WORLD BANK OPERATIONS

97.     The PRSCs and PRSGs, which are the main instruments for supporting the
SCADD, cover three areas that complement and reinforce the impact of the
Government’s education sector program viz. sustainable and equitable growth; the use of
public sector resources to promote human capital development, decentralization and the
modernization of public sector management. PRSG 11 was approved on July 26, 2011. In
addition to the PRSCs and PRSGs, the following Bank-financed operations complement
and reinforce the BEPSG operations: the Administration Capacity Building Project
(US$7 million equivalent, FY05); the Statistical Capacity Building Project (US$10
million equivalent, FY04); the Decentralized Urban Capacity Building Project (US$10
million equivalent, FY07); the Second Community Based Rural Development (CBRD)
Project (US$74 million equivalent, FY07) which aim to build capacity in public
administration for policy formulation, implementation and monitoring, streamlining
public administration, modernizing personnel management, and enhancing the poverty
focus of expenditure in the context of decentralization. The Local Government Support
Project approved in November, 2011 will help lay the foundations for increased
decentralization of the education sector as planned including in increasing the
participation of beneficiaries in program implementation.

98.     In the social sectors (education and health), the following Bank-financed projects
support social services delivery, particularly for the poor: the recently closed Basic
Education Sector Project (US$36 million equivalent, FY02 and additional financing of
US$15 million in FY08), the Post Primary Education Project (US$23 million equivalent,
FY06) in education, the HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project (US$22 million equivalent,
FY02), the Health Sector Support and AIDS Project (US$63 million equivalent, FY06
and additional financing in FY08) and the Reproductive Health Project (US$ 28.9
million equivalent, FY 12).Both the Basic Education Sector Project and the Post-Primary
Education Project were designed to support implementation of the PDDEB and to
strengthen institutional capacity in the sector to prepare for the use of policy
based/budget support instruments by the World Bank and other partners consistent with
the CASs at the time. Specifically, the PDO of the Basic Education Development Project
which was designed to support implementation of PDDEB 1 included “….Further, to
prepare for a shift from project to programmatic support, the Bank's assistance will also
aim to build the capacity of the Ministry of Basic Education (MEBA) with particular
attention to the areas of financial management budgeting, procurement, monitoring,
evaluation and donor coordination.? Similarly, the PDO of the Post-Primary Education
Project which was designed to support implementation of PDDEB 2 included “…. the
Ministry of Secondary and Tertiary Education and Scientific Research (MESSRS) will be

                                           32
supported to strengthen its capacity for financial management, procurement and
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems to move rapidly toward a programmatic
approach and budget support.? In line with this, both projects focused on investments
such as school construction, teacher training and textbooks procurement while the
complementary policy and institutional reforms that would ensure successful
achievement of the sector plan objectives were to be included in BEPSG 1-3. The
proposed BEPSG-3 operation will also set some policy foundations for the preparation of
the new Local Government Support Project. All three health sector projects will help
reinforce the interventions on health, nutrition and HIV and AIDS in BEPSG 1-3.
LESSONS LEARNED

99.    The design of the proposed operation draws on lessons from the Implementation
Completion and Results Report (ICRR) for the PRSC 4-6 series that was circulated to the
Board in February 2008, as well as from the Implementation Completion Report (IF-
N0070) for the Post Primary Education Project – P000304. The key lessons focus on the
experience in implementing policy and institutional reforms through general budget
support, promoting equity through reforms, decentralization and partnership with the
private sector. The key lesson is that general budget support needs to identify an
appropriate institutional anchor for reforms.

100. Ownership. Experience with previous PRSCs show that consistent progress was
made in areas under the direct control of the central ministries, notably the Ministry of
Economy and Finance, whereas progress was uneven where implementation of reforms
depended upon the involvement of sector ministries while the Ministry of Economy and
Finance managed the operation. This series of operations, while benefitting from general
budget support and the macro-economic and fiscal policies, would rely on the relevant
ministries responsible for education and training for implementing the sector reform
program. This would ensure greater ownership and commitment to the reforms during
implementation leading to greater chances of success.

101. Gender Equity. A key lesson learnt from the CAS is the need for better
understanding of challenges faced by women and girls through AAA in order to
mainstream gender in all operations. Interventions included in this series of operations
are based on the specific constraints analyzed in the CSR that prevent girls and other
disadvantaged groups from benefiting from education. Targeted responses for different
parts of the country have been identified and will be implemented with community
support to increase participation and learning achievement for girls in particular. This is a
continuation of an approach that has allowed Burkina Faso to make substantive efforts to
increase girls’ share in education as shown by the parity index girls/boys = 0.90.

102. Decentralization. The absorptive capacity of the budget is weak due to
centralized management which stretches government capacity in responding effectively
to requirements at the local level, while procedures for involvement of local authorities in
the management of schools remain unclear. In further pursuit of the decentralization
policy, responsibility for school construction has been expanded to include the private
sector and communes to increase the rate and quality of the infrastructures to be built. In

                                             33
2009, the ministry transferred infrastructure funds to 13 communes and in 2010 the
transfer was subsequently expanded to the 49 urban communes. This approach will be
deepened through decentralization/deconcentration in the management of the education
system, including expanding the use of the school based management approach.
Experience with decentralization, especially school based management, has demonstrated
that effectiveness in the use of resources and absorptive capacity can be substantially
increased through these methods. Ownership and participation by local communities is
stronger and more meaningful when communities are consulted and participate in the
decision-making process. The current ad hoc arrangements under which COGES function
will be better structured to avoid the existence of parallel structures to the local
government system including the communes. Schools through the COGES will therefore
gradually be made an integral part of the decentralized management system to
complement the functions of the communes starting with their participation in the
supervision of school construction in selected communes. Experience in the ongoing
Basic Education Project has shown that much better quality schools are built more
quickly when the private sector and communities are involved in the process.

103. Partnerships with the private sector and NGOs especially at the decentralized
levels are alternative ways to enhance post-primary education with low recurrent costs to
the Government and households. Access to private schools can also be more equitable
than for public schools. The Government is developing an appropriate regulatory
framework and specific incentives for municipalities and the private sector to increase
their participation in the provision of secondary education. Such efforts have already
started with the ongoing Post Primary Project.

104. Ensuring full involvement of all Government agencies involved with the
policy program before they are finalized. The experience in preparing the second
operation in these series suggests that while the government was fully committed to the
prior actions, the key units responsible for implementing the reform program had not
been fully involved in assessing the appropriateness and/or feasibility of undertaking the
proposed actions prior by the expected date. This has now been corrected and there is
full engagement of the key stakeholders in the dialogue that will lead to final approval
and implementation of the operation without any obstacles.
ANALYTICAL UNDER PINNINGS

105. The BEPSG- 3 benefited from several analytical reports. In FY08, the Country
Status Report and a regional water and sanitation PER helped deepen the World Bank’s
understanding of two key sectors in the decentralization process. The education sector
review was the basis for preparing the GPE request. A set of studies was completed in
FY06 to assist in identifying priority reforms for spurring growth, diversification and
employment. These studies included a labor market study and an investment climate
assessment (ICA). In FY07, an ESW on Decentralization and a PEFA were made
available.

106. The design of The BEPSG-3 also benefitted from the actual experiences of
PRSC series (7-10), and other sources including a report on the diagnosis of the

                                           34
Independent Audit Institution (Cour des Comptes) and its Action Plan (European
Commission, October 2006), as well as a report on the sources of growth and the
vulnerability of Burkina Faso’s Economy to exogenous shocks (Government - MEDEV,
December 2005). These studies helped identify the strengths and main shortcomings in
Burkina Faso’s fiduciary system and served as inputs for the authorities’ update of the
budget management reform program (Programme de Réforme de la Gestion Budgétaire).
This program, supported by all donors, is a key instrument toward increased donor
harmonization in Burkina Faso.

107. The Education Sector Review has assisted the Government in readjusting the
national program towards the development of the education sector as a whole. The report
concluded that expansion of basic education is hampered by costs associated with
schooling, and therefore free basic education will increase the demand for education,
particularly for rural communities and vulnerable families. It also underlined
shortcomings on quality due to poor management of teachers, low learning time,
inefficient use of classrooms with bi-annual student intake, and the need to expand multi-
grade classrooms as an alternative teaching method for cost effective expansion of the
system. Given the rapid expansion of the basic education sub sector, the shortage of space
in secondary education, and the need to increase the workforce ability to adapt to the
growing economy, alternatives for developing vocational training have been identified.
The adjusted national program has addressed these issues through the second phase of
PDDEB which is supported by the BEPSG 1-3.

108. The Making Decentralization Work study in 2007 identified key challenges
in this area. In particular, the report concluded that at the central level, the complex set
of decentralization and de-concentration structures requires further rationalization and
that the mechanisms for intergovernmental transfers needs to be clarified to ensure
development of an appropriate system, as well as regular and transparent transfer of
resources to the communes. The report also clarified that at the commune level, limited
basic capacity in planning and budget management constitutes a major obstacle, and that
local revenue collection and adequate staffing need to be addressed. A fund for municipal
development (Fonds Permanent de Développement des Collectivités Territoriales or
FPDCT) was developed in response to this diagnosis to facilitate local development. In
addition to the decentralization ESW, the World Bank commissioned a political economy
analysis in 2008, which highlighted that civil society and the media are constrained by
weak capacity and limited access to information pertaining to public decision making and
governance. The study concluded that to improve accountability and transparency, the
government needs to revisit the framework for access to information and develop
appropriate avenues for engaging more openly with civil society and the media. Using
these findings, the education sector has been at the forefront of implementing the
government’s agenda on decentralization. Both studies helped deepen the World Bank’s
understanding of two key sectors for the decentralization process and informed the policy
measures proposed in the matrix to improve access to quality basic education.

109. The CEM on growth, competitiveness and diversification prepared by the
World Bank highlights the critical importance of reforms in the country’s sustainable

                                            35
development strategy and in competitive human capacity building. The labor market
study conducted in 2006 identified priority reforms for spurring employment that
provided relevant insights into the choice of policies supported by the operation. The
PER (FY10) takes stock of recent trends in public spending and proposes a road map for
decentralization in health, education and rural development. It proposes ways to leverage
the decentralization process in order to improve public service delivery in these sectors.
Some of its early findings on the importance of transparency and accountability at the
local level have informed this operation.

110. Implementation of the Recommendations of the education sector in-depth
Public Financial Management assessment conducted by the World Bank and the
PER will ensure existence of effective controls. The assessment made recommendation
to: (i) improve the budget process (from preparation to execution) to prevent the loss of
funds due to in-year budget “regulation? and delays in school construction, (ii) use funds
for the purposes intended in an economical, effective and efficient way, and (iii) improve
accountability and transparency in funds management. The mechanisms to reinforce
financial management include: (i) preparation and adoption every year of a national
procurement plan; (ii) production of semi-annual financial and procurement
implementation reports; (iii) adoption of a decree on MOD (maitrise d’ouvrage
déléguée); (iv) transfer of funds to communes and deconcentrated units; (v) creation of
specific units in charge of procurement within each ministry; (vi) capacity building of
staffs on fiduciary aspects; (vi) mid-term review of the budget. Technical Assistance has
been put in place to improve fiduciary capacity building in order to test the program
budget approach and to implement an adequate internal audit arrangement including
physical control of infrastructures in the education ministries. The design of this
proposed BEPSG-3 Grant also benefitted from the results of the 2010 PEFA and the
Social Safety Nets Review 2010.

V. THE PROPOSED THIRD BASIC EDUCATION
PROGRAM SUPPORT GRANT
111. To achieve the objectives of the PDDEB to raise the educational level and
diversify the skills of the labor force to help promote equitable economic growth, the
proposed PEBSG-3 operation will support Government reforms and further strengthen its
education sector institutions to: (i) Increase access and equity to basic education (ii)
Improve the quality, efficiency, and relevance of basic education, and (iii) Strengthen
sector management and monitoring and evaluation of the sector.

112. As was the case for the earlier BEPSGs, the prior actions for BEPSG 3 are drawn
from measures in the PDDEB matrix (see measures highlighted in Annex 3) and have
been adjusted to meet the criteria for a DPO. The criteria for selecting the policy areas,
prior actions and triggers of BEPSG 1 - 3 were that they support and complement those
covered during phases 1 and 2 of the PDDEB and the efforts of other partners. For
example, adult education is not covered by BEPSG 1 - 3, as CIDA and Swiss
Cooperation are providing support in this area, while policy measures are included in
BEPSG 1 – 3 to complement the efforts of the Luxemburg and others in the further

                                           36
development of technical education and vocational training. Given the challenges
associated with the development of the technical education and vocational training sector,
reforms proposed in BEPSG 1- 3 are focused on refining the policies, strategies and
institutional frameworks that would permit a more rapid pace of reform in these areas in
the medium-term. Further development of TEVT will be more fully addressed in the
proposed Bank-supported skills development project under preparation. The policy areas
in BEPSG 3 are based on these criteria and are selected to further deepen the reforms
started in BEPSG 1 and 2.

Proposed Prior Actions for BEPSG 3

113. A key lesson learned during the processing of the BEPSG 2 has been applied in
the selection of the prior actions for BPESG 3: key stakeholders directly responsible for
the design and implementation of reforms should also be directly involved in the dialogue
to ensure realism, full commitment to the proposed actions and feasibility in carrying out
the reforms by the agreed deadline. The prior actions are shown in Table 5 below and in
Annex 4. They complete some of the reforms undertaken in BEPSG 1 and 2 and further
deepen others. No further measures are included for reforms already completed. For
example, no prior actions are included for roll-over of funds for school construction.
This issue was resolved by strengthening the management capacity of the agencies that
are responsible for the construction process and this permitted transfer of funds to these
agencies for use in more than one fiscal year. Similarly, no prior actions are included in
the area of repetition. The pedagogical and institutional reforms for this area were carried
out under BEPSG 1 and 2 and the next steps are to monitor continued implementation of
the approach and its impact on reducing repetition.

114. The specific prior actions for the third operation are shown in Table 5 below and
all the actions have been completed.

                                 Box 1: Good Practice Principles for Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership. The grant is embedded in the country’s education sector program-PDDEB-
which serves as an organizational framework for coordinating all interventions in the sector and is consistent
with the SCADD and the CAS. It defines the country priorities, strategic choices, and policy reforms to be
carried out for the education sector toward achieving the MDGs. It focuses on (i) ownership of the reform
process; (ii) alignment with the country’s PRSP; (iii) predictability of funds flow; and (iv) a results-based
approach which is coordinated and agreed upon with the Government, civil society, and the donors involved in
the sector. The World Bank, in conjunction with other donors, has supported the country in conducting a country
status report, and other analysis which have been the basis for framing sector reforms.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework. This series of DPOs is the first one in the education sector in Burkina Faso. It has been a joint effort
by government and donors based on the analytical work also jointly done, and on a common results framework.
The request was prepared by the government in 2007, endorsed and supported by local donors group (LDG) in
2008, and submitted to the FTI committee in December 2008. The LDG and the government conduct two annual
joint review missions based on the approved results framework, annual action plan, and MTEF which are
reviewed jointly and constitute the principal tool for coordination and evaluation of sector interventions. This
procedure allows for accountability based on the shared objectives and performance indicators.
Since 2002, IDA’s as well as LDG support through PDDEB has been part of the PRSP framework in response to
Government demands to align donor support to lower transaction costs and to harmonize the policy dialogue
with the other donors around the Government’s program and priorities, as well as the accountability framework
for the sector. This operation is completely aligned with the program which offers two principal sessions with
the Government to assess progress toward the objectives and policy outcomes (April-May), as well as to identify
policy measures and possible conditions for future support (October-November). The results of these reviews
also feed into the PRSP report on the sector. Only reforms truly owned by the Government, however sensitive,
have been retained in the program.
Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of World Bank support to country
circumstances. The first phase support for the Government’s Basic Education Sector Development Program, has
enabled the MENA to establish a process of harmonization among key development partners in the sector
through a harmonization framework which uses national systems and by supporting further improvements to
bring them to international standards. This includes: (a) joint supervision and review missions of PTFs and
government; (b) oversight by the MENA of donors interventions, which have contributed to ensuring
consistency of the interventions with the Government’s Program; and (c) signing and implementing a MoU
which governs collaboration on all aspects of the program.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement. The operational
policy matrix uses a limited set of conditions (7 in total for this third operation), which function as prior actions
for approval and future disbursement. The chosen policy measures were identified jointly with the Government
as well as the other donors from the policy matrix of the sector program (Annex 3) to ensure that they form an
integral part of the Government’s reform program and to ensure proper coordination with the other conditions
necessary for successful implementation of the sector program. The prior actions are focused only on critical
operational actions which would move the Government’s reform agenda forward. The matrix provides further
program benchmarks, some of which can be used as conditionality for subsequent operations.
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support. Progress in implementing the PDDEB is monitored and evaluated continually especially with regard to
policy implementation through the semi-annual joint government/partner reviews. These two sessions are
chaired by the Minister of Basic Education, supported by a secretariat made up of a representative of the
administration and the lead donor. The two sessions are open to interested parties, and the principal results as
well as a summary of the discussions are documented and are publicly available. The Government incorporates
feedback into its own reporting, including for the Annual Progress Report.

POLICY AREAS
115. The policy measures included in this operation are designed to address key policy and
institutional constraints to good quality basic education to a larger proportion of children,
especially girls and those in the rural areas, and to expand training opportunities for youth and
better align skills training with the labor market. Rural children and girls who are currently
disproportionately disadvantaged will be the main beneficiaries of these reforms. Specifically,
the main policy areas to be supported in BEPSG 3 are shown below.

Policy Area 1: Launching the system for multi-grade teaching.

116. Description: Government has fully launched the system for multi-grade teaching by
updating and distributing the guide for management of multi-grade schools and trained teachers,
school directors and teacher supervisors in their use.

117. Challenge: Children in areas with sparsely distributed population are disadvantaged
with regard to access to school because of inadequate school places and inefficient use of
teachers. Government regulations prohibiting “biennial? school intake6 and requiring multi-grade
classes in areas with low class sizes, were often not observed in Burkina Faso because of the
absence clear guidelines on the required organizational structures for multi-grade schools,7
absence of multi-grade teacher training and teacher supervision, as well as limited provision of
appropriately designed textbooks and school materials to support this new teaching method. In
addition, there was resistance from some teachers and the public, who were unfamiliar with the
method and feared this approach would be incapable of providing quality education.

118. Government Actions and Future Actions: The Government recognized the challenges
involved with the introduction of multi-grade teaching and took several steps to initiate the
required changes under BEPSG 1 and 2. The first step was to identify all the schools that were
practicing or that should have been practicing multi-grade teaching to assess the magnitude of
the problem and the effectiveness of what was being done, including identifying the specific
reasons for resistance from some teachers and communities. Based on this the government
established criteria for schools that would introduce multi-grade teaching, launched a
communications plan to inform the teaching profession and the public about multi-grade
teaching and strengthened institutional support for implementation of the system. To further
build confidence in the approach and to ensure its success in providing quality education, the
government also developed, with the participation of all stake holders, administrative and
organizational procedures as well as pedagogical methods and materials for multi-grade
teaching. These procedures were included in a guide that was field tested during school year
2010/2011 and subsequently revised to reflect the inputs of the users and stakeholders. Under
BEPSG 1 and 2 multi-grade classes were expanded through training of about 3,400 teacher
supervisors and teachers involved with multi-grade schools in the management of multi-grade
classes/schools, distribution of the draft multi-grade management guide to supervisors and
teachers, introduction of appropriate architectural designs for multi-grade schools and provision

6
  Anew class of first grade students is started only every second year so that children who would normally enter first
grade during one of those two years are grouped together in one class
7
  These include the criteria for deciding which schools would practice multi-grade, class sizes and combination of
grades in the same class and teacher/pupil ratios.

                                                         42
of appropriately designed textbooks and teaching materials. The government will fully launch
the multi-grade system by institutionalizing the changes in the organizational structure for
schools, teacher/pupil ratios and pedagogical and student testing methods required for multi-
grade teaching through the distribution of the revised guide to schools during school year
2011/12.

119. Specific Measures: The Recipient has fully operationalized the multi-grade system for
Primary Schools (in particular rural Primary Schools), commencing Academic Year 2011-2012,
by: (a) finalizing the guide for multi-grade teaching based on feedback from teacher and teacher
supervisors in the field to ensure acceptance of the guide by the users; (b) distributing the
updated guide to all teachers and supervisors involved with multi-grade teaching; and (c)
offering training for all teachers and supervisors newly involved with multi-grade teaching to
carry out and manage such teaching properly in the classroom.

120. The evidence for this would be: (i) Updated guide as adopted and report by the MENA
of the process of adoption and how these steps were completed; (ii) Report by MENA on the
distribution of the guide with signed delivery slips in the regions and provinces as well as a table
on the distribution by the CEB and (iii) Report by the MENA of the training of teachers and
teacher supervisors newly involved with multi-grade in the utilization of the guide.

121. Expected Results: The targets for the adoption and rolling out of this multi grade
management system are: (i) the primary level gross enrollment rate will increase from 72.4% in
2008/09, to 74.8% in 2009/10, to 77.1% in 2010/11 and to 82.4% in 2011/2012; (ii) all multi-
grade classes have been provided with a minimum pedagogical kit;

Policy Area 2: Further strengthening the decentralization structure by including the
COGES in school management including construction.

122. Description: The Government has expanded the scope and coverage of the
decentralization reforms from the communes to the COGES by involving the latter in school
management, especially construction, in areas in which they are being piloted to increase the
pace of establishing new and quality school places at affordable costs.

123. Challenge: School construction costs are high and the pace of construction, textbook
distribution and acquisition of school materials are slow in rural areas partly due to the
centralized management system. As a result, establishment of new school places falls far short
of requirements especially in remote and difficult areas. To address this issue, the government
decided to decentralize management of the education system to the communes. However, it
became evident from experience that this approach achieved only limited success as the
communes were not close enough to schools to have a significant impact on their operations.
This occurred even though there was a Presidential Decree permitting COGES participation in
school management. Pilot programs and research in Burkina Faso and other countries in sub-
Saharan Africa have shown that decentralization of school management including school
construction down to the community level with the involvement of COGES can make a positive




                                                43
difference in results. A comparative study8 on school construction concludes that of all the
various approaches to school construction, delegating contract management and supervision to
local communities is the most cost effective and can increase the pace of construction. It also
emphasized that community management can produce good quality construction. This is partly
because communities are able to quickly identify and resolve local priorities as well as prepare
and execute action plans quickly9.

124. Government Actions and Future Actions: As part of its decentralization strategy, the
government has fully transferred responsibilities for management of funds for school
construction, purchase of school materials and school operations to communes, starting with all
the 49 urban communes and 53 additional rural communes, consistent with its regulations
governing decentralization. To support this process the Government has also put in place a
mechanism for monitoring school construction in collaboration with the Ministère de l’Habitat et
de l’Urbanisme to ensure that minimum professional standards are maintained in the process. To
further strengthen the decentralization process, the government now plans to involve COGES
more closely in the planning and monitoring of the school construction to complement the
actions being taken at the commune level. Involvement of the COGES in the supervision of
school construction is only the first step in a reform process that would change the paradigm in
the relationship between the community and the school. The final objective is to encourage
school autonomy by including the community in school management committees that would be
responsible for managing the human and material resources of the school and oversee
educational outcomes and service standards, including teacher behavior. This reform is being
implemented in phases since all of the required changes cannot be implemented in one year. To
facilitate the reform process and to ensure success, this first step is being carried out in parallel
with measures to create awareness in communities about their new roles, build capacity in
communities to undertake these roles and establish institutional structures that would permit
efficient and effective flow and use of funds and smooth relationships among the various levels
of central and local government administration. This program will be gradually expanded to
cover the whole country through the implementation of the JICA financed Project for Support to
School Management Committees10. These reforms will build on successful experiences in
Burkina, the region and the world. Compared to what was done for the BEPSG 1 and 2 as well as
under the PRSC/Gs, the number and nature of the communes covered and the scope of
responsibilities transferred in the prior action for BEPSG 3 constitute further steps in the reform
process. In the first BEPSG operation, the transfer covered mainly the 49 urban and 20 rural
communes on a pilot basis and responsibilities delegated were limited to the management of the
entire cycle of school construction. The responsibilities delegated have now been fully extended
to all 49 urban communes and an additional 53 rural communes for a total of 73 rural communes.
Additional responsibilities have also been transferred to communes to cover purchase of school
supplies and management of school operational funds. The COGES are now being involved in

  These conclusions are based on regression analysis of 215 school construction projects in 30 countries (23 in
Africa) and 7 others in Latin America, East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia and compared various management
approaches such as centralized management by the MOE, contract management agencies (CMAs), NGOs and Social
Funds when acting as CMAs.

the over sight of school construction on a pilot basis as the COGES are closer to the schools and
have a direct influence on school operations because of their responsibility to develop and
monitor the implementation of school plans. This program is being implemented in communes
that have the capacity to ensure success as a way of testing approaches and determining how best
to organize this intervention before it is taken to scale. This is a further institutional change that
would deepen the decentralization process in relation to management of the education sector.

125. Specific Measures: The Recipient has enhanced the involvement of local communities in
the education process by expanding the decentralization process to ensure that: (a) over time, the
school construction programs in each Municipality where a Local Education Management
Committee has been established (53 Municipalities) are finalized and initiated only after
consultation with said Local Education Management Committee on the implementation of such
construction program; and (b) ensuring that starting Fiscal Year 2011, the school construction
programs in at least 12 of said (about 23 percent) Municipalities have been finalized and
initiated only after such consultations with their Local Education Management Committees.

126. The evidence for this is: Minutes of the commune meetings in twelve communes which
confirm that COGES were involved in the discussions regarding monitoring of the school
construction program.

127. Expected Results: The expected results are that unit costs of construction would drop and
that the pace of construction would increase without prejudice to the quality of school
construction. The unit cost of school construction by private contractors is 8,624,000 FCFA.
This cost has dropped by one third to 5,700,000 FCFA with the involvement of communities in
pilot programs. This should increase the rate of building new schools leading to increased
enrollment, internal efficiency and improved quality. With greater decentralization of
management of funds for school operations and school materials, availability of school materials
will increase and school operations will become more effective leading to overall increase in
learning achievements and school completion rates especially in rural areas.

Policy Area 3: Launching a new distance education training program for secondary school
student teachers in Math and Science.
128. Description: The Government plans to improve teacher quality by expanding the output
and increasing hiring of university graduates in math and sciences. It also plans to improve
management of the actual hours spent by teachers in secondary education to reduce the use and
cost of part-time teachers (heures de vacation).

129. Challenge: The supply of qualified teachers in math and sciences is inadequate to
meet the needs, while some teachers in other subjects do not carry the full required number of
teaching hours even when the authorized overall teacher/pupil ratio is applied. Schools in rural
areas are particularly deprived as the few qualified teachers in math and science are reluctant to
be assigned to these areas without adequate incentives. This anomaly is because teachers are
recruited based on the teacher/pupil ratio even though some of the teachers cannot teach math or
science. As a result, schools are assigned many more teachers than they need in non-math and
science courses and these teachers become underemployed. At the same time, science and math
classes are not properly manned. To address this issue, schools hire part-time teachers for math

                                                 45
and science. This increases the teacher/pupil ratio above the approved levels incurring additional
teacher salary costs that are even higher than needed because the guidelines for managing these
part-time teachers are not clear and are not fully respected by schools. For example part-time
teachers covered over 157,000 teaching hours at a cost of 2,000 FCFA per hour not all of which
was needed. The government has been trying to address this issue but the key constraints are
limited supply of teachers with these specializations because of inadequate training capacity, the
design of training programs and some resistance from teacher unions to the proposed corrective
measures.

130. Government Actions and Future Actions: The government has been trying to reduce the
use of part time teachers by introducing special allowances to encourage teachers to serve in
rural areas. This however has not been enough because of limited supply of math and science
teachers. Not only are there not enough teachers trained to cover the required teaching load, but
there is competition for those who are trained in these subjects from the growing and
diversifying economy. The government is therefore introducing reforms in BEPSG 1 -3 to
increase teacher supply in these subjects. Specifically, the Government is implementing a
strategy to improve the quality of regular and distance education university pre-service and in-
service teacher training programs in math and science. The new systems and training modules
for the pre-service and distance training programs were completed and approved under BEPSG 1
and 2. As a prior action for BEPSG 3 the institutional arrangements for administrative and
pedagogical management of the system and supervision of system quality for distance-training
will be put in place and the program launched. This will include regulations relating to inter alia
entry qualifications, criteria for establishing distance education centers, structure for delivering
the program and for evaluation and certification of students.

131. In addition, to overcome resistance from unions, a monitoring system, including
collecting, compiling, analyzing and publicizing information on the misuse of part-time teachers
has been established, to support debate on further measures that would ensure that full-time
teachers respect the required number of hours and that use of part-time teachers follows the
prescribed guidelines. The information collected through this monitoring system is considered
essential as a basis for discussions with stakeholders, including trade unions, on what measures
should be taken to reduce the use/cost of part-time teachers. Stakeholders are sometimes
reluctant to accept measures proposed by the government to reduce the use of part-time teachers,
considering the proposals as punitive because the total costs and inefficiencies are not fully
understood.

132. Specific Measures: The Recipient has introduced a new distance education training
program for students training to become math and/or science teachers in Secondary Schools and
has enrolled at least twenty-five new students in said program for Academic Year 2011-2012.

133. The evidence for this is: (i) Ministerial order nominating the officials responsible for the
training; (ii) Ministerial order defining the organizational and operations of the distance training
program and (iii) Report by MESS on the implementation of the distance training program
showing that at least 25 students have been enrolled in the program.
134. Expected Results: The target for this module is that the university based program is in
place and the distance education program will be put in place as a prior action for this operation.

                                                46
The target is to train between 50 and 150 math and science teachers annually through the
distance training program. It is expected that this will reduce the number of hours (157,144)
covered by part-time teachers and eventually the overall costs of the teacher salaries.

Policy Area 4: Reducing the amount of lost Teaching Time in Primary and Secondary
Education.
135. Description: Introducing mechanisms at the school level to increase the actual number
of teaching hours in basic education to complement the administrative measures already taken at
the central level.

136. Challenge: The number of hours teachers spend in the classroom is substantially lower
than that prescribed because of unauthorized/unplanned school closures, cumbersome
administrative procedures and unauthorized and lengthy teacher and student absences. Time is
lost at the start of the school year while schools are being prepared for school opening. School
materials arrive late, delaying opening; teacher transfers take place at the start of the school year,
leading to late arrival of teachers at their assigned schools; and some schools need repairs before
they can be used. Rural communities are disproportionately disadvantaged in this respect as
teachers often have to travel long distances to deal with official and personal/family issues.
Monitoring of school closures in these areas is also difficult as supervisors/inspectors have to
travel longer distances to observe these events.

137. The National Law 13 of April 28, 1998, Decree No. 98 of September 15, 1998, and Law
19 of 2005 regulate the absence of all civil servants in Burkina. These texts apply to teachers and
sanctions provided are gradual and vary according to the duration of absence. The application of
these Acts has not been very effective. In April 2010, an assessment revealed that from 2000 to
2010, more than 200 cases of sanctions had not been processed up to the final step in accordance
with the provisions of the laws. Two main reasons partly explain the weak application of the
texts. The first reason was related to lack of information and knowledge of the texts by school
officials who are responsible for implementing them, including those responsible for human
resources management at the decentralized levels and school heads who are in a position to
notice any absences. The second reason was related to poor communication between the
decentralized levels and the central level where important decisions on sanctions, such as
suspension of salary and dismissal are taken.

138. Government Actions and Future Actions: The government has implemented measures to
increase the time spent by teachers in schools via better management of school closures and
teaching time, and improved teacher management. With regard to school closures, the
government has issued instructions in its “School Opening Circular? addressed to all schools that
unauthorized school closings should be reduced. Better management of teaching time is being
handled through introduction of a period of administrative school opening prior to the arrival of
students in October 2011 to permit preparation of schools, including teacher appointments and
deployment, repair of classrooms and acquisition of desks and teaching materials to reduce time
lost at the start of the school year . With respect to teacher management, the two bottlenecks
identified were addressed. Training programs were organized in 2009 and 2010 to improve
knowledge of the regulations by human resource managers at local levels and all directors
responsible for deconcentrated entities. In addition, communications have been enhanced to

                                                 47
enable the Human Resources department to reach managers in the decentralized structures more
easily to facilitate application of the regulations. An annual report presenting the follow up of
sanctions taken during school year 2009-10 using the new procedures concluded that these
measures have improved application of the laws and hours of schooling (see annex 1).

139. In addition to the administrative measures already taken under BEPSG 1 and 2, the
government will, as a prior action for BEPSG 3, introduce a system for monitoring the actual
number of hours spent by teachers in class and publicize the results in the press. This is partly to
deal with some of the sensitivities11 associated with some of the proposed actions needed to
ensure compliance with current regulations. The government will use this information to build
consensus with the public on further measures by informing them of the gravity of lost time on
task and the corrective measures it plans to take to improve the situation. In addition, through
this monitoring system, school heads will be required to systematically monitor and report on
teacher absences and they will be subject to a continuous auditing process by the school
communities who will be aware of teacher attendance and sanctions. This will induce greater
discipline in the behavior of school directors, teachers and supervisors who will be responsible
for supervising schools in the implementation of the system and the imposition of sanctions at
the school level.

140. Specific Measures: The Recipient has introduced a system for monitoring the time spent
by Primary and Secondary School teachers throughout the Recipient’s territory in the classroom
actually teaching and has published the results of said monitoring for Academic Year 2010-2011
in newspapers of wide circulation, all with the objective of improving the amount of time spent
by said teachers effectively teaching students.

141. The evidence for this is: (i) Report by MENA of the monitoring of actual teaching time
including (a) a presentation of the complete monitoring system and its tools and (b) analysis of
the data obtained; and (ii) Copies of the publication of the results in the press.

142. Expected Results: The target for this measure is that effective teaching hours would
increase from 574 in 2007 to 736 in 2010 and 800 in 2011. As a result of these measures already
implemented it is estimated that the time on task in primary education has increased from 574 or
about 59.6% of the total to 736, 76.5% of the total. The 194 hours lost due to teacher absences
has been reduced by 69 or 36% while lost teaching hours due to organizational and
administrative reasons dropped even more sharply from 194 to 101 or by 48%. The results on
lost time due to teacher absenteeism for 2010 and 2011 were published and civil society
responded positively to the report. However, they recommended that teachers be further
sensitized to fill in the forms and that the report be distributed widely. Increased focus on teacher
absences as planned for this operation will further reduce the lost time in this area while work
continues on the other administrative issues.
 Policy Area 5: More Effective use of the Results of the Assessment of Student Learning.
143. Description: The Government has launched a system for the utilization of the results of
student assessment to improve student learning outcomes in both primary and secondary
education.

11
  The argument of trade unions is that teachers are being unfairly punished for lost time on task when some of the
reasons have to do with overall management of the system

                                                         48
144. Challenge: Improving student achievement is constrained by the lack of reliable
information on student performance and areas of pedagogical weaknesses that need to be
addressed. This is because the system for student learning assessment is still embryonic and there
is no consistency between the methods used at the primary and secondary levels. Also, in the
past the results were not analyzed to identify learning weaknesses nor publicized to generate civil
society debate as a foundation for building consensus on possible solutions. In addition, there
was little coordination among the various departments responsible for pedagogical management
and preparation and implementation of the assessments as well as provision of feed back to
schools.

145. Government Actions and Future Actions: In order to monitor student learning and to
help identify difficulties in the way teachers teach and how students learn, the government has
implemented assessments of student learning in 45 provinces for primary education and 23
provinces for secondary education and has publicized the results in the press. At the primary
level, student assessment focuses on French grammar and reading, math and science of
observation. In post-primary education student assessment is carried out on French grammar and
writing, Math, Science, History and Geography in the second year of junior secondary education.

146.     The government now plans to launch a system for using the results of these assessments
to improve learning outcomes. This system will include designing these assessments to ensure
that they could identify specific learning weaknesses so that the results of the assessments can be
used by schools/teachers to focus attention on specific areas of learning weaknesses in the
teaching process. To achieve this the government will also establish structures to ensure
systematic collaboration among the departments responsible for basic education (primary and
lower secondary education), the inspectorate, curriculum, examinations and policy and planning
as well as the regional directorates of education in the preparation and implementation of the
assessments, the production and the dissemination and use of the results to inform the public on
the one hand and as a feedback to schools directors, teachers and inspectors to improve the
teaching process.

147. Specific Measures: The Recipient has operationalized a system, commencing Academic
Year 2011-2012, designed to provide to all Primary and Secondary Schools, and their teachers,
as well as Primary and Secondary School teacher training institutions throughout the Recipient’s
territory, performance assessments of such entities’ students, and recommendations, based on
said assessments, of ways to improve teaching approaches, with the objective of improving pre-
service training and teaching in primary and secondary level classrooms.

148. The evidence for this is: For the primary level: (i) a note from MENA and MESS
presenting the production and distribution of the student assessments and (ii) a synthesis by
MENA and MESS presenting the assessment of student achievement by province showing the
key weaknesses of students by zone and instructions on how these weaknesses should be
addressed; for the secondary level the note will include an example of the delivery note for
signed by each school when the report is received and (iii) a Circular letter from the Secretary-
General of MENA to teacher supervisors instructing them on how to use the student assessments



                                                49
to provide support to teachers through the various in-service teacher training mechanisms
including the GAP, Education Conferences, PAI, PAC etc.

149. Expected Results: The expected results are that: (i) Primary Completion rates will
increase from 41.7% in 2008/2009 to 45.9% in 2009/2010, to 51.4% in 2010/2011, to 56.3% in
2011/2012, 75.7% in 2015 and to 100% in 2020. (ii) Low secondary Completion rate will
increase from 15.8% in 2008/2009 to 17.1% in 2009/2010to 17.6% in 2010/2011, to 18.8% in
2011/2012.

Policy Area 6: Improving the Quality and Relevance of Technical Education and
Vocational Training.
150. Description: The government has introduced a system for dual apprenticeship12 training
in technical education and vocational training

151. Challenge: The education and training system has been unable to respond adequately to
the skills needs of the economy due to the absence of an appropriate strategy, a lack of focused
interventions, and inefficient and uncoordinated training institutions. This has made it difficult to
establish a robust investment program for skills development. Where training has been provided
in public institutions, practical application of theories learnt has been weak, making it difficult
for students to perform in the job market immediately after training.

152. Government Actions and Future Actions: Conscious of these weaknesses, the
government has established a strategic framework for technical education and vocational
training. This strategy is being implemented through realigning training programs to the needs
of the economy and promoting collaboration among training institutions to improve efficiency
and to reduce costs. To further develop the system, the Government has finalized arrangements
to make training institutions autonomous, including allowing them to provide paid services to the
private sector and retaining the revenues to cover their recurrent costs. The government now
plans to further develop technical training by introducing dual apprenticeship in at least four
institutions and creating awareness in the public about the opportunities for skills training. This
dual apprenticeship will allow students in public training institutions to spend time in private
enterprises for practical training to better prepare them for the job market.

153. Specific Measures: The Recipient has: (1) adopted a regulatory framework designed to
encourage the introduction of Dual Apprenticeship training programs, whereby students
attending technical and vocational training programs intern in private enterprises as part of their
training; (2) introduced and operationalized, commencing Academic Year 2011 - 2012, said
programs in at least four training institutions; and (3) informed the public through appropriate
media channels of such Dual Apprenticeship opportunities available to primary education
graduates who attend technical education and vocational training programs.

154. The evidence for this is: (i) ministerial (MENA) instruction authorizing the
establishment of dual training (ii) the final regulatory framework under which dual training will

   “Dual apprenticeship? refers to a partnership between public training institutions and the private sector that would
allow students in training institutions to undergo practical training in private enterprises as part of their training
programs.

                                                          50
be will be carried out following comments from the Bank and (ii) a note by MENA presenting
the current status of dual training in at least 4 establishments carrying out dual training in 2011-
2012 with the number of students involved. Expected Results: The targets are: (i) short training
courses and dual apprenticeship training would be in place; (ii) Increase in the annual flow of
young people from 25,877 in 2008/09 to 28,500 in 2009/10, to 30,000 in 2011/12, and to
50,000 young people in 2015; (iii) Common management tools are available that allow for
planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of TVET; (iv) Intake to the post-primary
are streamlined between the various sub-sectors (general education and TVET); (v) % of public
schools practicing TVET as a training mechanism; (vi) the number of public institutions
practicing TVET dropped from 10.35% in 2008 to 8.76% in 2010.

155. With this shared use of resources in 2009, 1,411 apprentices were certified in programs
run by the Ministry of Youth and Sports because of access to 7 workshops and 14 trainers under
the MESS. Supply of relevant skills at affordable costs for the labor market will continue to
increase as the program expands.

Policy Area 7: Extending Teaching of School Health and HIV/AIDS to Upper Secondary
Schools.
156. Description: Revising the curricula for upper secondary education to include material on
school health and nutrition and HIV/AIDS.

157. Challenge: Many communities especially in the rural areas suffer from food insecurity
and the impact of HIV/AIDS, but designing and implementing cost-effective programs to meet
the diverse and sometimes difficult conditions in schools has been a challenge. Some
communities are reluctant to have schools introduce material on sexual behavior even if it has to
do with serious illnesses such as HIV/AIDS. Collaboration amongst the Ministries responsible
for health, nutrition and HIV/AIDS and education has not always been easy. It has therefore
been difficult to limit the impact of these factors on access to and quality of education.

158. Government Actions and Future Actions: MEBA, MESSRS, MOH and the HIV/AIDS
Commission have finalized a strategy on school health, nutrition and HIV/AIDS which was
approved by the council of ministers in December, 2009. The Government has started
implementing the new policy and strategy on managing health and nutrition in lower secondary
schools (orientations stratégiques du secteur de l’éducation pour la lute contre les IST-VIH, la
malnutrition et les autres problèmes de santé (2009-2011) by (i) revising the lower secondary
school curriculum to include the relevant contents related to health, nutrition and HIV/AIDS and
(ii) using the revised curriculum in lower secondary schools with the support of Teachers’ guides
in these areas. The government will further extend these interventions to upper secondary
education by revising the curricula for this level and subsequently introducing them it in schools.

159. Specific Measures: The Recipient has adopted and introduced, commencing Academic
Year 2011, a revised curriculum for upper secondary education that integrates health, nutrition
and HIV/AIDS education.

160. The evidence for this is: (i) a note presenting the process for preparing the curriculum
including the manner in which the curriculum was made available to schools through the

                                                51
electronic resource centers and (ii) the circular sent by the DG for Training through the Regional
Directors instructing them to implement the new curriculum.

161. Expected Results: The target is that the curricula for lower and upper secondary schools
include material on health, nutrition and HIV/AIDS issues .The strategy was approved by cabinet
in October 2009. With this approval, a new curriculum including health nutrition and HIV/AIDS
was introduced in lower secondary education in 2010. In this operation, the curriculum for upper
secondary education will be revised to include material on these subjects.

162. Expected impact of the BEPSG Series:            Implementation of policy and institutional
reforms contained in these series of operations will positively impact expansion of quality
education and increased supply of skilled labor to the economy. With regard to enrollment, the
program will ensure that adequate resources are available for continuation of the school
construction programs from one fiscal year to the next to help raise the enrollment rate in
primary education. The primary level gross enrollment rate increased from 72.4% in 2008/09, to
77.6% in 2010/11, slightly beyond the expected target (77.1% in 2010/11) and is expected to
reach 82.4% in 2011/2012. Expansion of secondary school places is also expected partly from
increased supply of qualified teachers especially in math and science.

163.     The program will help improve quality and internal efficiency through introducing a
viable system for multi-grade teaching, increasing the number of effective teaching hours by
reducing teacher absences and the number of unauthorized school closings. As a result repetition
rates fell from 10.6% in 2008/09 to 10.12 % in 2009/10, to 8.1% which was the result expected
in 2015. At the secondary level, the decrease of repetition rate is almost insignificant going down
from 26.31%% in 2008/09 to 25.9% in 2010/11 against the 19.2% expected. The primary
completion rate increased from 41.7% in 2008/2009 to 45.9% in 2009/2010, and to 52.1% in
2010/2011which is beyond expectation (51.4%). It is anticipated that the Completion rate will
reach 56.3% in 2011/2012. The lower secondary completion rate increased from 15.8 in
2008/2009 to 17,1% % in 2009/2010, and to 17.5% in 2010/2011 as planned and it expected to
reach, 18.8% in 2011/2012.

VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION
POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

164. The BEPSG 1-3 is expected to have a significant positive direct impact on poverty
reduction. First, the expansion of quality basic education targeting in particular rural areas as
supported by the proposed operation will help increase individual and family incomes and
economic growth by providing opportunities for increased productivity in the rural and urban
economies. In addition, targeted interventions to increase the participation of disadvantaged
groups, including girls in the education system, would help promote greater social cohesion and
increased productivity of groups now largely on the margins of economic growth. In turn, this
will help increase individual and community incomes for disadvantaged groups. Externalities
from increased levels of education will help raise the standards of living of communities and
disadvantaged groups through improved practices in child bearing and rearing, nutrition, health
and sanitation. Improved practices in these areas will in turn reduce the burden on the public
sector to provide social safety nets, thereby creating fiscal space for increased investment in
development expenditures.

165. Second, the strengthening of public financial management is expected to enhance
efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources. Such measures will
increase the country’s absorptive capacity for external resources as it will enhance social service
delivery, particularly for the poor. Both of these measures will help increase returns to
investments in the education sector.

166. Third, the reforms related to decentralization/deconcentration including piloting
initiatives for closer involvement of families and communities in the management of schools will
help promote efficient use of resources and increased learning outcomes by building stronger
community/school organizations that would work more effectively to improve the
teaching/learning process. A significant byproduct from increased transfer of resources to
communities would be higher incomes in those areas as a result of increased demand for local
goods and services.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARD ASPECTS

167. Under Operational Policy 8.60 on Development Policy Lending, the Bank is
required to determine whether specific country policies supported under the operation are
likely to cause significant effects on the country’s environment and, in the event of such
likely effects, assess country systems for reducing any such adverse effects and enhancing such
positive effects. In the event of significant gaps in the analysis, or shortcomings in the country
systems, the Bank is required to identify how such gaps or shortcomings would be addressed
before or during program implementation, as appropriate.

168. The specific reforms supported by the proposed development policy grant are not
likely to have significant negative effects on the country’s environment, forests and other
natural resources. The potential environmental effects associated with the implementation of
                                                53
the reforms supported by the proposed BEPSG-3 are mainly related to school construction and
unlikely to have significant negative environmental effects. For the education sector, any likely
adverse environmental effects associated with school constructions or rehabilitations are
expected to be minor, site-specific and manageable. While conducting the PRSC in May 2007,
the environmental team assessed the readiness of the government to deal with environmental
issues. The assessment found that Burkina Faso has the necessary regulations pertaining to
environmental assessment but that compliance with such regulations is weak. To overcome that,
the Ministry of Environment has prepared a program budget to reflect its institutional and
technical capacity needs until 2010. In this light, ongoing Bank projects in some cases provide
training and capacity building in environmental assessments and environmental management to
the Ministry of Environment staff.

169. The ongoing Bank-financed education sector projects provide adequate support for
environmental capacity building and compliance in the education sector. In general, review
of Burkina Faso’s environmental management activities has been conducted across a number of
sectors through IDA-financed investment projects, in particular, the education, agriculture,
health, natural resources management, and energy sectors; none of the environmental
assessments for these operations revealed any major environmental issue. With respect to the
education sector specifically, environmental and social compliance is ensured through the
insertion and implementation of the environmental and social management clauses in contracts
for enterprises that are involved in schools constructions and rehabilitation; and this is still done
in the ongoing Basic Education Support Project and the Post Primary Education Project.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

170. The Ministry of Economy and Finance will be responsible for overall management of the
Grant. The Permanent Secretariat for the Monitoring of Basic Education Development Plan (SP-
PDDEB) in the MENA will lead the Government’s technical team responsible for
implementation of the policy reforms and institutional strengthening supported by BEPSG 1-3,
with representatives of the Ministries of Economy and Finance; Youth, Vocational Training and
Employment; Social Action and National Solidarity; Basic Education and Literacy; Secondary
and Tertiary Education; Decentralization; Public Administration; and representatives of teachers
unions and parents associations.

171. The World Bank’s supervision effort will be aligned with the Government-led
Monitoring and Evaluation system underpinning the PDDEB, the Annual Sector Action Plan,
and the two joint (donors and government) supervision missions conducted each year. The
specific benchmarks and outcomes to be monitored under the proposed Grant (Annex 4) are
extracted from the Basic Education Development Program as synthesized in the Letter of
Development Policy (Annex 2), thus providing significant benefits in reducing transaction costs
for the Government. These outcomes are included in the joint performance matrix of the
education sector under the SCADD. IDA staff has been working with the authorities and other
donors under the SCADD to ensure that coordination of the supervision efforts will increase
predictability and aid alignment with the budget cycle. Output indicators used for program
monitoring for the sub sector are reflected in Annex 5.


                                                 54
172. On the technical aspects, the program management and monitoring mechanism set-up
during the first phase of PDDEB implementation has been strengthened and expanded at the
central and de-concentrated levels to cover new ministries included in the basic education reform
(Youth, Vocational training and Employment, Social Action and National Solidarity, Secondary
and Tertiary Education,). In each ministry, the Directorate for Studies and Planning (DEP) is
responsible for data collection and program monitoring; they will provide annual information for
program monitoring and evaluation. Each DEP will provide data on a timely basis to SP/PDDEB
for consolidation and analysis in order for them to prepare the periodic reports in accordance
with PDDEB M&E manual. A small committee comprising each DEP will validate the data as
consolidated by SP/PDDEB before convening the session of the National Steering Committee.
The framework for implementation will include the following:

173. The National Steering Committee under the Prime Minister’s Leadership. This
committee consists of ministers, directors of ministries in charge of basic education,
representatives of teachers’ unions, parents’ associations and NGOs. The committee meets
annually to assess progress and make recommendations for policy adjustments and improved
implementation.

174. The Permanent Secretariat of PDDEB (SP/PDDEB), in place since 2000, coordinated the
first phase implementation of the program. Its authority was extended, in line with the broader
education sector reform program, to include other relevant line ministries, in particular the
Ministry of Secondary and Higher Education.

175. In addition to these institutional arrangements, there are three instances where
consultations, coordination, and team work will take place: (i) The Joint Reviews which are
governed by the Partnership framework (“Cadre Partenarial?) based on an MoU signed by all
donors active in the sector; (ii) The joint supervision missions (field visits and technical working
groups); and (iii) the thematic groups and associated sub groups in each region of the country,
which are focused on specific issues of the program (access, quality, sector management and
fiduciary management).

176. Deconcentrated units of line ministries in charge of basic education are organized into a
single regional unit which will carry out planning, coordination, and monitoring activities under
regional governors’ responsibility. These units will produce quarterly reports to inform their
direct supervisors and the SP/PDDEB on program implementation progress and issues to be
addressed. Their specific mandates are to:
-   monitor implementation on a daily basis;
-   assess reports presented by each local unit and ensure effective coordination among various
    representatives of line ministries (MEBA, MESSRS, MASSN et MJE);
-   conduct field visits to collect information and monitor implementation progress of the
    various components;
-   produce required reports, propose and implement corrective measures for sound activities
    implementation;



                                                55
-   monitor closely the education sector program activities: each region will hold a bi-annual
    regional steering committee session to assess progress and address major issues.
- participate in the joint supervision missions at the national level.
177. In addition to regular monitoring of implementation to assess in achieving the program
objectives, assessment of the impact of the reforms carried out under these operations have
started and will continue following the closure of this operation. For example, the results of the
actions taken to increase time on task in the first two operations as shown in par. 8 and annex 1,
were obtained through impact evaluation studies conducted as part of the reform agenda. The
impact of the measures to deepen reforms in these areas as well as assessments of student
learning will also be carried out following the closure of this operation. The latter will also
measure the impact of all the measures taken to improve quality in the PDDEB. In addition to
these studies on specific measures, a more comprehensive assessment of the impact of the series
of operations will be included in the assessments to be carried out as part of The Africa Program
on Education Impact Evaluation.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

178. Since the BEPSG 3 operation is a DPO processed under OP 8.60 there needs to be
assurance that the country’s fiduciary, including anti-corruption, arrangements are adequate to
ensure transparent and efficient utilization of the funds. The following provides a brief
assessment of the current fiduciary system in Burkina Faso, including plans for further
improvement and concludes that the system meets the requirements for a DPO. However, given
the “Burkina paradox? which suggests that improvements at the macro level do not sufficiently
impact on the poor to alleviate poverty, efforts are being made to address this issue including two
operations aimed at strengthening demand-side fiduciary interventions which are being
implemented in parallel with this operation.

179. Financial Management.              Overall, the Bank has judged implementation performance
of the PFM reform program to date and Government’s commitment to PFM improvements as
exemplary. This was evidenced by repeated PEFA assessments, showing progressive
improvements and good overall performance, and was also reflected in Burkina’s relatively high
CPIA score. Fiduciary arrangements were reviewed by the Bank in the context of the new
Growth and Competitiveness (GC) DPO series, the first of which is under preparation, and
updated in May 2011 following the unrest. The fundamental PFM systems have not changed so
far. There is no evidence that the systems and institutions have changed as a result of recent
events. Burkina has made efforts to align the composition of its spending to the priorities laid
out in its poverty reduction strategy, and to introduce a medium term outlook in the budget.

180. One of the remaining challenges for Burkina Faso’s PFM is to move from a focus on
inputs and compliance to a greater emphasis on performance, value for money and service
delivery. The country’s outcomes in terms of poverty reduction do not yet match its good PFM
and macroeconomic performance, and part of the reason lies in its insufficient effectiveness of
public spending (the recent PER calls it the “Burkinabè paradox?). The Government has realized
this and has been at the forefront of the push within WAEMU to shift the focus of the PFM
directives towards performance budgeting, and the GC-I DPO is expected to include triggers to


                                                56
foster this important aspect. At this stage, programs have been designed for all line ministries
(including education sectors) and institutions with support from IMF and UNDP.

181. The Central Bank of the West African States (BCEAO), including Burkina Faso,
continues to improve its governance structure. The updated safeguards assessment of BCEAO
issued by the IMF in March 2010 revealed that the Institution continues to have adequate
controls in place at the operational level. However, the IMF noted that, the overall governance
framework should nonetheless be strengthened by the addition of an audit committee to ensure
that the Board of Directors exercises appropriate oversight over the control structure, including
the audit mechanism and financial statements. The upcoming implementation of the Institutional
reform of the West African Monetary Union (WAMU) and the BCEAO should help correct that
situation. In addition, efforts to fully implement International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) should be pursued as adopted internationally by other central banks.

182. Bank financial management specialists reviewed the flow of funds arrangement between
the Central Bank (BCEAO) and the Treasury (DGTCP), taking into account the findings of an
audit of the flow of budgetary funds between the Central Bank and the Treasury funded by the
multi-donor Budget Support Group. The team concluded that current arrangements are adequate,
with fiduciary risks within acceptable risk tolerance levels. However, the team recommended
that the information systems of these two institutions be linked, so as to minimize delays and
discrepancies in flows reporting, thus eliminating cumbersome reconciliations. At the request of
donors involved in budget support operations, the Government annually contracts an external
auditor to provide assurance on the flow of funds of budget support operations between the
BCEAO and the Treasury. The 2009 audit report on the flows of funds, which was produced in
September 2010, included an audit opinion with some disclaimers due to delays from two donors
in disbursing budget support operations. These disclaimers have no impact on the fiduciary
arrangements for this operation. The 2010 audit report will be finalized before end of the fiscal
year.

183. At the decentralized level, expenditure control mechanisms are in place to mitigate any
possible shortcomings. Specifically, the existing reporting system at the decentralized level is
based on financial management procedures that allow for tracking expenditures with a very
detailed breakdown per chapter, article and paragraph including a split between capital and
operating expenditures per sectors (education, water and sanitation, health, sport, and culture)
transferred as part of the administrative decentralization process. The PRSC 9 has promoted
transparency and accountability in the use of financial resources transferred to the decentralized
levels by getting from the Authorities the consolidation and the posting on the Ministry of
Finance's website13 for all rural and urban communes in the country, the detailed expenditures
(including education sector) and revenues either transferred from the center or mobilized at the
decentralized level. In addition to the prior reviews conducted by local financial controllers
(decentralized at the province level), annual post reviews have also been conducted by the
auditing department of the Treasury since 2007. Since 2010, internal audit missions at the
ministry in charge of education are performed based on a risk based methodology. The first audit
report highlighted a set of weaknesses mainly related to the lack of manual of procedures. The
independent Supreme Audit Institution is being made more independent and its capacity is being
13
     http://www.dgb.gov.bf/comptes_A/CA_2009.htm

                                                   57
strengthened. A system was also created for delegated audit of small communes’ accounts by
regional treasurers acting on behalf of the Court of Accounts. It is anticipated that these measures
will secure essential conditions required for an independent and effective Court of Accounts.
Existing flow of funds audit arrangements in place for all budget support operations will
continue to be performed. In preparation for the shift toward program budgeting, the Ministry of
Finance is currently piloting at the Ministry of Education, the deconcentrated execution of
budget procedures through a FM shared service unit (unité de vérification des mandats) located
within the Ministry of Education with the aim of providing in situ budget, financial control, and
payment services. Lastly, the Bank is currently supporting the piloting of a complaint handling
system in the projects involved in the decentralization sector (including the education’s sector).

184. Procurement. As with all DPO operations, this proposed third and final in the series of
operations does not finance specific expenditures, and the Bank Procurement and Consultant
Guidelines do not apply. Further strengthening of national public procurement continues, and the
focus is equally split between progressively reforming the legal and regulatory framework as
well as focusing on strengthening the procurement capacity and the transparency of the
procurement system. In this regard the Government has taken the following steps: (i) adopted an
action plan based on the findings of the 2005 Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR),
and prepared an additional action plan in 2010 based on an update using the same methodology
(ii) setup several new legal and regulatory reforms under the new procurement Code, and (iii)
issued procurement regulations and Standard Bidding Documents, which are being further
refined, and (iv) established a new regulatory agency for public procurement14. Furthermore on
the capacity issues, the government continues to deconcentrate and decentralize procurement
functions for procurement units to the regions and ministries, including the Ministry of Basic
Education and Literacy.

185. In 2008, the Government adopted a new procurement regulation which builds on
weaknesses identified during various review missions and audits conducted by the Government
and donors. In 2009, the Bank conducted a diagnostic study based on the OECD DAC
methodology, the assessment is finalized, and the government has decided to implement the key
recommendations of the assessment to improve its national procurement system.

186. The government has already started implementing its new regulations, which provide a
sound framework for carrying out procurement activities with the goal of meeting regional and
international standards. It has set key ministries, such as the Ministry of Basic Education, as
ministries of focus for strengthening of procurement capacity and is closely monitoring
procurement processes. It is expected that these arrangements, will enhance procurement
activities.

187. Corruption. The Government is also making good progress in fighting corruption.
Although Burkina’s ranking and score in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception
Index declined in 2010 (from 81/180 to 98/178 and 3.6 to 3.1 respectively), it remains among the
better-ranked WAEMU countries. Following the adoption in May 2006 of a national anti-
corruption policy (which is currently undergoing revision), the Government committed to step up
efforts to fight corruption with the establishment of an independent audit institution, the High
14
     Autorité de Régulation des Marchés Publics (ARMP).

                                                          58
Authority for State Oversight (Autorité Supérieure de Contrôle de l’Etat, ASCE), and the
dissemination of a good governance plan. The publication of annual audit reports by both the
ASCE and the Court of Accounts since 2008, strengthened and de-concentrated administrative
and fiscal inspections and expanded powers of the Court of Accounts to sanction misconduct
have all increased the visibility and demand for action against corruption. In the wake of recent
civil unrest, the Government has re-affirmed its commitment to fighting corruption. Several
major procurement processes were cancelled following the discovery of irregularities related to
corruption, steps have been taken to expedite pending corruption proceedings, and the ASCE has
committed to developing an inclusive national corruption tracking tool to monitor trends in
corruption and better target anti-corruption reform.

188. Social Accountability Interventions. Over the years, the government has been
promoting participation of beneficiaries in service delivery in the education sector through a
variety of interventions including the establishment of Parent/Teacher Associations, Mothers for
Education and COGES by various decrees and regulatory orders (arretés). Through these
associations beneficiaries are able to ensure that development plans are properly adapted to the
local needs and circumstances and that allocations and use of resources are fully transparent and
efficient. To further increase the impact of these associations on the management of the
education system, the COGES is being taken to scale and institutionalized through the JICA
financed Support to School Management Committees Project. This project will support the
COGES in designing and using school plans for management of resources to increase their
effectiveness. The links between the COGES, communes and the center will also be
strengthened to promote efficiency in the decentralized structure.

189. The Community Monitoring for Better Health and Education Service Delivery Technical
Assistance Grant financed by the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) is also helping to build
local capacity to engage in the provision of local services as a way of improving service delivery
and accountability. Specifically, that project is raising awareness of communities and
beneficiaries about the value of monitoring service delivery and building links among the various
organizations and training their members to strengthen their effectiveness. In addition, various
monitoring tools such as community score cards, trace-in-kind approaches and inspection of
public works projects will be introduced and expanded. This approach could eventually evolve
into the contract watch approach which is being implemented in selected countries in the region.
Further the JSDF Grant will promote dissemination of the results of the application of these tools
to the wide public to seek their reactions. The grant also includes an evaluation component that
will assess the objectives of the Grant as a basis for refining the approaches.

190. To complement measures taken at the community level, the Bank Country Office is
proactively implementing the Bank’s policy on access to Bank-related information by creating
awareness at all levels of society about this policy and encouraging project staff to facilitate
access to such information by the public. This initiative also includes e-ISRs through which the
public will be provided information on progress in the implementation of Bank-financed
operations for their assessment and feedback.

191. Disbursement and Auditing. A single tranche of US$35.0 million will be disbursed
against satisfactory implementation of the prior actions under the program. The proposed

                                               59
grant will follow the World Bank’s disbursement procedures for development policy operations.
At effectiveness and upon receipt of a withdrawal application from the Government, and
provided the World Bank is satisfied with the implementation of the program being carried out
by the Government and with the adequacy of the Government’s macroeconomic policy
framework, the proceeds of the grant will be deposited by the World Bank into a Government
account at the Central Bank (BCEAO) which forms part of the country’s foreign exchange
reserves. As a due diligence measure, the World Bank will seek confirmation from the
Government that an amount equivalent to the grant proceeds has been credited to the
government Treasury account (DGTCP), (within 30 days of disbursement) with an indication of
the exchange rate applied and the date of the transfer. If, after being deposited to this account,
the proceeds of the grant are used for ineligible expenditures as defined in the Grant Agreement,
the Government will be required to refund, promptly upon notice from the World Bank and
directly to the World Bank, an amount equal to the amount of said payment. Amounts refunded
to the World Bank upon such request will be cancelled. No dedicated account is required as no
concerns with the fiduciary safeguards environment have been identified. The closing date will
be September 30, 2012.

192. Fiduciary obligations of the program will be carried out by regular units of ministries,
and each Budget and financial management unit will be responsible for overall activity
implementation and management of funds. The grant will be managed by the Ministry of
Economy and Finance.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

193. Macroeconomic risk. The recent rebound in gold and cotton price has helped Burkina
Faso recover from the global economic crisis. However, the country remains heavily exposed to
swings in the terms-of-trade and weather-related shocks. The growing import demand consistent
with economic activities and increasing oil prices, coupled with a deterioration of the terms of
trade, could weaken the country’s external position. Other potential risks include a decline in
foreign aid and hence budget support that may generate negative effects on expenditure
dedicated to public investment and on debt sustainability. This could make it difficult for the
government to make the necessary budgetary allocations to the education and training sector.
Effective implementation of growth-enhancing reforms and export diversification will help
mitigate these risks. Also, the availability of the GPEF has helped the government minimize the
negative impact of expenditures on reconstruction following the floods on the education sector.
The long-term risk of falling budgetary allocations to the education sector is also minimized by
the inclusion of this sector as one of the priorities in the MTEF and recent trends continue to be
positive in spite of exogenous shocks.

194. The macro-economic risks were heightened in 2011 following the social unrest which
threatened to disrupt public sector operations partly by diverting resources from essential current
and development expenditures to security and emergency operations. However, based on
assessments of the impact of these events to date the impact has been minimal and future
prospects are projected to be good.




                                                60
195. The macro-economic risks were heightened over the past few months following the social
unrest which threatened to disrupt public sector operations partly by diverting resources from
essential current and development expenditures to security and emergency operations. However,
based on assessments of the impact of these events the impact turned out to be minimal and
future prospects are projected to be good.

196. Reforms related to multi-grade classes, abolition of biennial intake, enrollment and equity
may trigger resistance. To mitigate these risks, the Government has as part of the prior actions
for the second operation implemented a communications plan aimed at seeking the views of all
stakeholders on the issues and building consensus on the proposed solutions. In addition, the
guide for the implementation of multi-grade classes was piloted during school year 2010/11 and
revised before it was finalized and distributed for use in schools along with the necessary
training and resources. This gradual approach is consistent with and part of the government’s
nationwide campaign to build consensus on sensitive issues before they are implemented.
Progress in implementing these reforms indicates that the inclusive and consultative approach
has been working well.

197. The decentralization strategy raises significant challenges, including in the education
sector. Officials at the center may resist the transfer of responsibilities to local Governments,
while local Governments may lack resources and capacity to carry out their new responsibilities.
To address this issue, the Government has adopted a participatory and gradual decentralization
approach using the DFGG tools that includes establishing a framework for increased
collaboration between the de-concentrated units and local government authorities as well as
increased involvement of communities in the management of schools. The Government also
plans to involve communities in the oversight of management of resources at the school level to
bring significant benefits to schools in the short term while capacity for full devolution is being
put in place. The financial flows system is also being strengthened as part of capacity building
for decentralization to ensure adequate and predictable transfer of resources to lower
governmental levels.

198. These interventions are part of a multipronged approach the government is using to
address the wide scope and complexity of the decentralization program. In the SCADD the
government committed to transfer 4 percent of national government revenues to be transferred to
communes by 2013.

199. In addition, initiatives aimed at reinforcing capacity at the local level are included in
other programs financed by the Bank such as the Local government Support Project and other
members of the donor community. The decentralization projects financed by the Bank and the
EU are designed specifically to address commune capacity issues. As part of the Bank financed
Local Government Support project, initiatives will be put in place at the central government level
(including the PM and Ministers of Finance and MATD) to address the lack of transparency and
predictability of fiscal transfers.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Burkina Faso
Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 11/162
December 27, 2011

  Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency
  of the IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of
  the country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of
  Article IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the
  regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries
  with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board
  discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a
  particular case.
On December 21, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV
consultation with Burkina Faso.1
Background
Sustained implementation of sound policies and reforms in recent years, as well as strong performance in key sectors
driving growth helped the Burkinabè economy withstand several exogenous shocks in 2008-10. Economic growth has been
robust; inflation has been trending down since the flare-up in 2008 caused by the global food and fuel prices; and the
external current account deficit has narrowed, mostly reflecting the significant increase in gold exports. The authorities have
maintained fiscal consolidation efforts, while mitigating the impact of exogenous shocks, and enhancing poverty reduction
programs. In the later area, the authorities implemented a number of initiatives and took measures to support vulnerable
groups. Key programs included school lunches, support to the elderly, and a cash transfer program. During 2001-10, the
share of poverty reducing spending in total expenditure rose from 17.5 to 28 percent. These efforts were aided by progress
in revenue mobilization and financial support from Burkina Faso’s development partners.
The authorities made important progress in implementing structural reforms in recent years, particularly in revenue
collection, expenditure and Treasury cash flow management, cotton sector rehabilitation, the business environment, and the
financial sector. In the later area, the authorities prepared strategies for the development of the financial and microfinance
sectors, and implemented a divesture and rehabilitation program for selected banks. They continue to seek funding for the
efficient implementation of the financial sector strategy. The authorities have also maintained a prudent borrowing policy,
consistent with debt sustainability analysis that points to a high risk of debt distress for Burkina Faso.
In 2011, economic growth is projected at 5.6 percent, from7.9 percent in 2010, mostly driven by an expansion in the
agriculture and mining sectors, which were marginally affected by the social turmoil and exogenous shocks in the first half
of the year. Thanks to a good harvest, inflation is estimated to average 1.4 percent. The external current account (including
grants) is projected to stabilize around 3½ percent of GDP, benefitting from the projected improvement in terms of trade;
and the overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) would increase to 10.9 percent of GDP, from10.1 percent of GDP in 2010,
partly reflecting measures taken by the authorities to address adverse shocks in 2011.
The medium-term outlook is promising. Economic growth is forecast to reach 6.4 percent by 2013, thanks to the
programmed public investment scaling-up, particularly in infrastructure; continued structural reforms; and the projected
expansion in the mining sector. Inflation is expected to remain below 3 percent, thus complying with the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) convergence criterion. The external current account deficit is projected to widen
from 8.2 percent of GDP in 2011 to 10.9 percent in 2013, mainly because imports demand is expected to remain strong and
to grow faster than exports in 2012-13. With continued measures to enhance revenue mobilization and expenditure
management, the fiscal position is projected to improve in 2012 and over the medium-term, with the overall deficit
declining from 10.9 percent of GDP in 2011 to 9 percent in 2013, notwithstanding an increase in investment and pro-poor
spending.

Key risks to the economic outlook are related to the economy’s vulnerability to terms of trade shocks that might affect
commodity prices, particularly for cotton, gold, and oil; and adverse changes to climatic conditions that would weaken
growth prospects.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the authorities’ sustained implementation of sound policies and structural reforms, which
has contributed to robust economic growth, low inflation, and a broadly favorable external position. They noted, however,
that global uncertainties and climatic conditions pose downside risks to the near-term outlook. In addition, daunting
macroeconomic challenges remain, and poverty is still widespread. Directors underscored that continued fiscal
consolidation, improved social policies, and decisive implementation of structural reforms will be critical to achieve
sustained, broad-based economic growth and poverty reduction.
Directors encouraged the authorities to maintain fiscal discipline within the context of a medium-term fiscal framework,
while increasing investment and social spending. They welcomed the continued focus on revenue mobilization to boost
domestic resource availability. Directors also emphasized the need to strengthen expenditure management, contain current
spending, and increase targeted poverty-related spending. In particular, they underscored that wage policy should remain
prudent and supportive of medium-term fiscal objectives, and they encouraged full pass-through of international fuel price
movements to domestic fuel prices.
Directors agreed with the authorities’ focus on scaling up investment to close the infrastructure gap and boost economic
growth. Nevertheless, they stressed the need to improve investment efficiency, and to ensure that investment financing
strategies are consistent with long-term debt sustainability. They noted that Burkina Faso remains at a high risk of debt
distress, and called for continued prudent debt management anchored on grants and highly concessional loans.
Directors stressed that further progress on structural reforms will be critical to enhance competitiveness and stimulate
broad-based economic growth. They highlighted the importance of reforms to improve the business environment and
support private sector development, including strengthening the regulatory and judicial framework. Continued rehabilitation
of the cotton sector will be crucial. Directors also urged acceleration of financial sector reforms to reduce financial sector
vulnerabilities and to broaden access to financial services.

  Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and
policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing
Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in
summing up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.
