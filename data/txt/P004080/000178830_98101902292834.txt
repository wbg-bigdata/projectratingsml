REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED SECOND LOAN TO
THE MEDIUM INDUSTRY BANK
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $55.0 million to the
Medium Industry Bank (MIB) to be guaranteed by the Republic of Korea.
Interest on the loan would be at 7.9% p.a. The loan would be repaid
in conformity with a schedule based on the aggregate of the amortization
schedules of MIB's subloans, and would have a maximum repayment period of
17 years, including 3 years of grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest Economic Report ("Growth and Prospects of the Korean
Economy") was distributed under cover of SecM77-158 dated March 4, 1977.
The Country Data Sheets are attached as Annex I.
Recent Economic Developments
3.        During the last few years, the external economic environment has
been subject to unexpected, sharp and sudden changes which seriously affected
economic activity in Korea and, more particularly, its external trade and pay-
ments situation. The boom in world trade led to increases in the volume of
Korean exports of 46% and 54% in 1972 and 1973 respectively. But in 1974,
the quadrupling of oil prices combined with a sharp rise in the prices of
foodgrains and capital goods led to a deterioration of 18% in the terms of
trade. At the same time, the deep recession in the industrialized countries
caused a slackening in the growth of exports to some 9%. The purchasing power
of exports, which had expanded by over 46% each year in 1972 and 1973, actually
decreased by nearly 11% in 1974. During 1975 export volume grew by a remark-
able 23%, assisted by the devaluation of the won in December 1974 and a very
vigorous drive to expand and diversify markets. However, part of this gain
was offset by a further deterioration of 10% in the terms of trade.
4.        Among the major economic targets set by the Government in 1976 were
the containment of inflation to 10% and a reduction in the balance of payments
current account deficit substantially from $1.9 billion in 1975 to $1.4 billion.
The former goal was achieved and the latter substantially surpassed. Wholesale
prices, which had increased by nearly 80% between the end of 1973 and the end
of 1975, increased by around 9% in 1976, primarily because import costs (which
more than doubled between 1972 and 1974) apparently decreased by about 2% in
1976; moreover, the growth in domestic credit was limited in 1976 to 21%
(compared with increases of 54% and 32% in 1974 and 1975 respectively).
5.        Primarily, as a result of the recovery in the OECD countries,
Korea's exports increased in 1976 by 36% in volume and there was an improve-
ment of 14% in the terms of trade. While part of this increase in exports
may have been supplied by a drawing-down of inventories, it is evident
that it could not have been achieved without substantial additions to



- 2 -
production capacity in the last couple of years. A remarkable feature of
Korea's economic management through the crisis of 1974 and 1975 was that
fixed investment continued to grow at an average of 11% p.a. in constant
1970 prices, raising its ratio to GNP from 24.3% in 1973 to 25.6% in 1975.
6.        The real growth of GNP in 1976 was 15.2% as compared with an
average increase of 8.5% in the two previous years. This was the result
primarily of buoyant exports, but the extraordinary growth in agricultural
output was also a significant factor. Value added in agriculture grew
at over 7% in each of the last two years. While weather conditions were
favorable over the past three seasons, there has also been a real improvement
in yields as a result of better technology and the more effective use of the
various inputs.
7.         At the end of 1976, total outstanding debt was about $7 billion
in medium and long-term maturities and an additional $2 billion in maturities
of less than one year. Debt service payments of nearly $1 billion in 1976
were well within Korea's repayment capacity. The ratio of debt service pay-
ments to exports (of goods and nonfactor services) declined from an average
of 21% in the early 1970s to 11% at the end of 1976.
8.        It would appear that Korea achieved several of the objectives it
set for itself in the Third Plan, despite the balance of payments difficul-
ties experienced in 1974 and 1975 and a generally less favorable international
economic environment than had been expected. The rate of growth of GNP
was 11.2% p.a. compared with the original target of 8.6%. Considerable
progress has also been made in expanding the manufacturing sector. Progress
in reducing reliance on foreign savings and in restraining inflation
fell short of expectations. Furthermore, even with employment growing at
4% p.a. during the Third Plan period, there has been little improvement in
the unemployment situation.
9.        Preliminary indications suggest that industrial production, exports
and balance of payments targets for 1977 will be realized and perhaps slightly
exceeded. Industrial production, which rose at an annual rate of over 9%
during the first four months of 1977, increased at a faster pace in the
subsequent months; a real growth rate of GNP of 10% appears to be achievable.
Exports are now expected to rise by about 30% and imports by 27%. Services
receipts may be higher than originally projected due to a considerable increase
in both tourism and remittances from workers and construction companies
overseas. The current account deficit may be as small as it was in 1976 or
even slightly lower. Price increases are averaging about 10% as planned. The
introduction of the value added tax as well as increases in money supply
resulting from rising levels of net foreign assets are exercising pressures on
prices, and the Government plans to hold the price line by further liberaliza-
tion of food and other imports as well as by keeping low the prices of grains
released from government stocks under the Grain Management Fund.



-3-
Longer-Term Prospects and Program
10.       The preparation of the Fourth Plan (1977-81) afforded an oppor-
tunity for a comprehensive review of Korea's economic problems, prospects and
priorities. Korea's longer-term goals as specified in the Plan are "growth
with enhanced self-sufficiency" and "greater equity and social development."
It is the firm intention of the Korean Government to achieve a maximum rate
of growth consistent with a sound balance of payments and also with the main-
tenance of internal financial stability. The Plan projects that the current
account deficit will be eliminated during the next few years. National sav-
ings are expected to finance as much as 92% of total investment as compared
with about 72% in the Third Plan period (1972-76). However, these projections
may prove overly optimistic. The domestic savings target appears somewhat
ambitious, while the projected investment requirements may turn out to be too
low.
11.       Growth and stability are not the only objectives.    Enhanced equity
and greater social development are also of importance in the Korean scheme of
things. The main emphasis is: (a) on providing adequate employment oppor-
tunities for the rapidly growing labor force to prevent any increase in the
unemployment problem; and (b) on achieving a wider distribution of the bene-
fits of growth. Rising employment is the most important instrument for
achieving an equitable distribution of the benefits of growth. This is all
the more so because, despite the success in reducing the rate of growth of
population to around 1.8% p.a., the labor force continues to grow at over
3% p.a. because of the baby boom following the Korean War in the early 1950s.
Health outlays will increase as a proportion of total investment with special
stress on preventive care and an innovative health delivery system to service
low income families, especially in the rural areas. Rural incomes are
expected to increase as a result of a further improvement in agricultural
terms of trade and increased opportunities for nonfarm employment, primarily
through the Saemaeul (New Community) Movement and small industries development.
The quality of life in the rural areas is to be further enhanced by the
provision of additional infrastructure facilities.
12.       The achievement of these goals would not require a change in
the basic development strategy of export-led growth, which Korea has
followed so successfully since the mid-sixties. GNP is expected to rise
at 9.2% p.a., fueled by the growth of 16% p.a. in the volume of manufactured
exports. The manufacturing sector, which now contributes 32% of GNP, is
expected to provide 54% of the increase in GNP during the Plan period,
increasing at 14.3% a year. The ratio of commodity exports to GNP is
expected to rise from the current level of about 30% to about 42% in 1981,
with the manufacturing sector providing about 92% of total exports compared
with 90% in 1976. This demands the achievement of continuous gains in effi-
ciency and productivity. Korea's comparative advantage will gradually shift
towards manufactures, such as machinery, electronics and shipbuilding, which
require relatively more skilled labor. It is also necessary to achieve some
import substitution in steel and chemicals to ensure an adequate supply of



- 4 -
intermediate inputs for the export industries. These changes in the indus-
trial structure will require intensive efforts to improve the mechanisms for
the transfer of foreign technology and the development of appropriate indi-
genous technology.
13.       The Plan targets for exports are challenging but appear to be
attainable, given the extraordinary drive of the Korean exporters, a con-
tinuation of the present level of export incentives and the assumption that
the economies of the OECD countries will grow at an average rate of around
4-5% annually while the volume of world trade expands at an annual rate of
about 8% during the period.
14.       Strong policy measures are envisioned in the Plan to increase the
mobilization of domestic resources. Success in restraining inflation is
expected to have a significantly favorable effect on the mobilization of
private savings. In the past, private savings have fluctuated with the move-
ment of the terms of trade and the rate of inflation. The terms of trade are
projected to be fairly stable through the Fourth Plan period and a rate of
inflation of the order of 8-9% a year is foreseen. The Government has taken
measures designed to channel the higher private savings likely to be gener-
ated by these developments to an increasing extent into the financial sys-
tem, and, thereby, into more effective use for productive investments. In
addition to restoring a positive real rate of return on financial forms of
savings, the measures include the imposition of a capital gains tax at the
rate of 50% on undeveloped land, and 30% on nonprincipal household dwellings.
Funds that went into real estate are now flowing into the securities market
where the after-tax yields are more attractive. At the same time, direct
measures have been taken to force corporations to "go public," thus increas-
ing the supply of corporate securities. Steps are also being taken to
increase the variety of financial securities in terms of maturities, yields
and conditions that would constitute an attractive package to investors.
15.       The measures to increase the mobilization of private savings
are supplemented by fiscal actions to increase public savings. The defense
tax surchage imposed in 1975 is to be continued and a value added tax has
been introduced. The extent of the subsidization of farmers and urban
consumers through the Grain Management Fund is being reduced. The increased
resource mobilization and the strong restraint on most current expenditures
will make substantial budgetary surpluses available to finance capital
expenditures.
16.       The Plan's priorities, strategy and programs are sound.    The con-
tinued emphasis on relatively rapid growth is essential in the light of the
need to create additional employment for the growing labor force. Further-
more, the predominant role the export sector is expected to play is appro-
priate in view of Korea's limited natural resources. Moreover, Korea has the
manpower and the entrepreneurial capacity to implement the Plan's invest-
ment program. The Plan strikes a reasonable balance between the various



- 5 -
objectives of increasing employment, maintaining a minimum growth of per
capita incomes, strengthening the balance of payments and making progress
towards diversifying the industrial structure so as to sustain export growth
in the 1980s.
17.       Notwithstanding the efforts being made to increase the mobilization
of domestic resources, Korea's ability to meet its investment requirements
from domestic savings may fall short of the Plan projections, and a sizeable
continuing inflow of external capital will be necessary. It is estimated
that Korea may need to borrow an average of $2.5 billion p.a. over the next
several years. Its ability to obtain foreign capital in these amounts on
reasonable terms will continue to be a challenge. The servicing of the debt
should not pose serious difficulties given the present debt service ratio
and the prospects for continued export growth, provided that the proportion
of external debt incurred on shorter term and at high interest rates is not
excessive. On the assumption that Korea can obtain the required inflow of
capital on reasonable terms, the debt service ratio which now stands at
around 11% is expected to decline slowly to just under 10% at the end of the
decade and remain at about that level during the 1980s.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
18.       As of October 31, 1977, Korea had received 34 Bank Loans (including
one Third Window Loan) and 8 IDA Credits, totalling $1,588.8 million in loans
and $106.9 million in credits (taking into account cancellations and the
refinancing of one IDA Credit in a subsequent Bank Loan).
19.       A substantial part ($558.2 million) of Bank financing has been for
the transport sector - $219.7 million for railways, $191.5 million for
highways and $147.0 million for ports. $289.5 million has been lent for
agricultural projects. The Korea Development Finance Corporation (KDFC) has
received $220 million, the Korea Development Bank (KDB) $142.5 million, and
the Medium Industry Bank (MIB) $30 million in Bank loans for relending to
private industry. An additional $80.0 million has been lent directly to
industry in support of a heavy machinery project. A total of $103.3 million
has been provided for three education projects and a vocational training
project; $25.0 million for a tourism project; $15.0 million for a secondary
cities project; and $60 million for a rural infrastructure project. In
addition, two Program Loans amounting to $175 million have also been granted
to Korea.
20.       As of October 31, 1977, $648.4 million of the total Bank lending
remained undisbursed on effective Loans and Credits, mostly from commitments
in the past two years. The rate of disbursement has increased quite markedly
in recent months. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Loans,
IDA Credits, and IFC Investments as of that date and Notes on the execution
of ongoing projects. As indicated in the Notes, progress on project imple-
mentation is generally satisfactory.
21.       Excluding one project that was subsequently cancelled, IFC had by
October 31, 1977, entered into 18 commitments totalling $73.0 million (net
of participations and cancellations). Under consideration are projects in
soda ash manufacture, plastic film, and a lead smelter.



- 6 -
22.      The emphasis which the Government places on agricultural and
rural development is reflected in the Bank's proposed lending program.
A second rural infrastructure project has been appraised and a multi-
purpose project, including an irrigation component is under preparation.
23.       The further development of the industrial and agricultural
sectors and the anticipated growth of exports will require concurrent
infrastructural development. Although the transport sector will be given
less emphasis than in the past, the investments required are large, and thus
there is considerable support for this sector in the proposed program.
24.       The share of the Bank Group in Korea's total external debt dis-
bursed and outstanding at the end of 1976 was about 8.9%, and the share of
debt service was of the order of 4.9% at that time. These ratios are
expected to increase to around 18% and 11% by the end of the present decade.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Industrial Development in Korea
25.       Korea has been able to sustain an impressive record of economic
performance for more than a decade, achieving an average growth rate of
aggregate real GNP of nearly 10% p.a. since 1962. This appears all the more
remarkable when judged in the context of the country's poor endowment of
natural resources. Since most of the country is mountainous, only about a
quarter of the land area is cultivable. Korea's mineral resources are also
limited: the country's principal known mineral resource still is anthracite
coal, available in quantity, but of relatively poor coking quality.
26.       Given the poor natural resource endowment, Korea's growth strategy
has been based on the expansion of manufacturing activity and of manufactured
exports, rather than on import substitution as has been the case in several
developing countries. Rapid growth induced considerable structural changes
in the economy. Though agriculture grew on average at a rate of 4% p.a.
between 1961-76, the rapid growth of the manufacturing sector, at nearly 19%
p.a. (almost double the rate of growth of real aggregate GNP), transformed the
nature of the economy from a predominantly agricultural one (the share of
agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, in GNP was 44% in 1961, while that
of mining and manufacturing was only 12%) to one which is significantly
dependent on mining and manufacturing (by 1976, the share of mining and
manufacturing in GNP rose to around 31%).
27.       The principal impetus to this extraordinary transformation of the
economy came from the growth of manufactured exports. In the early 1960s,
exports, though growing in relation to GNP, were still not very significant.
In 1965, commodity exports were $175 million; of this total, manufactured
exports amounted to $144 million, constituting about 8% of manufactured
output. By 1976, commodity exports growing at about 32% in constant prices
over the past decade rose to almost $8 billion; the share of manufactured
exports in the total exceeded 90% and their share in manufactured output



- 7 -
was over 25%. The growth of manufactured exports was accompanied by some
changes in the structure of exports. Though Korea's export pattern continued
to display a high degree of reliance on a few labor-intensive traditional
exports: textiles, clothing, footwear, plywood, electronics, and certain
miscellaneous manufactures, there was a discernible trend in the direction of
more sophisticated skill-intensive products. Several new light industry
products, such as travel goods and plastic articles, and heavy industry goods,
such as electrical machinery and transport equipment (including ships), were
added to Korea's range of manufactured exports. At the same time, despite the
relatively negligible role of import substitution in the aggregate, the
pursuit of backward linkages, usually from exports, enabled domestic production
to replace imports in certain selective sectors, e.g. textiles, apparel,
sewing machines, certain metal products and chemicals, and particularly after
1968, in particular sectors of the basic metal, petrochemical and machinery
industries. This has enabled Korea to prevent its aggregate dependence on
imported intermediates and investment goods from rising significantly over the
last decade.
28.       Korea's export performance and its efforts at selective import sub-
stitution were also reflected in the structural changes which occurred in
the manufacturing sector over the last decade. While value added in manufac-
turing rose at an annual rate of about 18.7% p.a. (in constant prices),
between 1962 and 1975, the composition of manufacturing output changed quite
significantly in favor of the metals, machinery and chemicals subsectors. The
share of these three major manufacturing groups rose from 21% in 1961 to
about 33% in 1975. The most striking increase was registered by the combined
machinery, electronics and shipbuilding industries spearheaded by electronic
products.
29.       Several factors have contributed to this remarkable industrial and
export performance: e.g. the impact of the concentration on labor intensive
activities; the efficiency of factor use in manufacturing (the sector is
characterized by low capital-output and capital-labor ratios); the rapid
growth of labor productivity, due to the high levels of education, skills and
labor discipline, as well as the maintenance of a high level of investment in
industry, at an average rate of about 7% p.a. during the last decade; the
monitoring of wage and productivity levels which has helped to maintain
Korea's competitive position with respect to its competitors - other developing
countries such as the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, as well as the Republic
of China, Singapore and Hong Kong in certain product categories; and not the
least important, the combination of a broad range of export incentives
maintained the profitability of Korean exporters in the face of relatively
high rates of domestic inflation without jeopardizing the efficiency of
resource allocation.
30.       Korea's long-term development plans are formulated on the premise
that its growth over the past decade, which was based on rapidly expanding manu-
factured goods exports, can be extrapolated through the early 1980s. To this
end, the Fourth Five Year Plan (1977-81) aims at the achievement of an
increase in manufactured exports of the order of about 16% p.a. This
target, together with a greater domestic demand for manufactured goods, will



- 8 -
require a growth rate in the output of the industrial sector of around 14%.
The Government is also convinced that the long-term viability of the Korean
economy depends upon reducing its reliance on imported capital and interme-
diate goods. Further, there is also a. realization that the continued growth
of the industrial sector will be instrumental in providing employment
opportunities for the country's growing labor force. Korea's industrial
development strategy for the Fourth Plan period centers around export expan-
sion, net import substitution and meeting the growing home market demand.
31.       The Plan's estimate of total investment required for the expan-
sion and restructuring of Korea's industrial sector has been set at around
$10.5 billion over the 1977-81 period. There are grounds for believing,
however, that Korea's investment needs for 1977-81 may have been underesti-
mated, while the domestic savings target appears somewhat ambitious. The
conjunction of these two possibilities would lead to a continued reliance on
substantial inflows of foreign capital. The Korean Government has in recent
years undertaken a major effort to mobilize domestic resources. Apart from
the establishment in 1973 of the National Investment Fund (NIF), which is
expected to finance a sizeable portion of the investment needs of Korea's
major industries, the Government has also embarked on a comprehensive capital
market development plan, including the restructuring of the Korean Securities
Financing Corporation and the development of new financial institutions such
as merchant banks and the Korea Export Import Bank. Over the period 1977-81,
the Plan expects domestic funds to provide 63% of the aggregate investment in
manufacturing and foreign capital to provide the remainder. About three-
quarters of this foreign investment is expected to be directed to the heavy
and chemical sectors.
32.       The timely provision of long-term finance for the key industries
will depend to a large extent on the efficient operation of the NIF and the
tapping of other sources of funds such as Korea's three major development
finance companies, the Korea Development Finance Corporation, the Korea
Development Bank and the Medium Industry Bank. These three institutions
were responsible for 64% of the total medium- and long-term loans in Korea
in 1975. The Bank has already made two loans to KDB and six to KDFC; the
proposed loan will be the Bank's second to MIB and represents the continua-
tion of our support of the Government's efforts to encourage the location of
relatively small industrial units in the rural areas and so increase off-farm
employment opportunities. All three institutions have obtained loans from
the Asian Development Bank; KDFC and KDB have also been successful in borrow-
ing from commercial sources abroad. The magnitude of the demand for term
finance in Korea is such that these three institutions, even if their
operations increase significantly, will continue to act in a complementary
rather than a competitive manner.
The Small and Medium-Scale Industrial (SMI) Sub-Sector
33.       "Small and medium industrial enterprises" in the Korean manufactur-
ing sector are defined as those with less than 300 employees or with total
assets not exceeding W 500 million. Within this sector, there is no
official differentiation between small and medium-scale enterprises. The
SMI sector is an important segment of the Korean industrial structure;



- 9 -
it accounted for 96% of the total number of industrial establishments, 32%
of industrial value added, 45% of industrial employment and 34.5% of total
exports in 1975. SMI's share of fixed industrial investment in that year
was only 20%, reflecting the high degree of labor-intensiveness. One
indication of the sub-sector's efficiency is that labor productivity within
it increased during the 1968-75 period by an annual average of 26% compared
with 23% for large enterprises. As a consequence of the rapid growth of the
industrial sector as a whole, many of the small and medium-scale enterprises
have expanded their size and employment and moved into the large-scale group
of industry. In terms of value added, textiles is the most important group
in SMI (20.4%), followed by food processing (18.4%), machinery and fabricated
metals (17%) and chemicals (17%).
34.       Government efforts to assist SMI started in the early 1960s with
the establishment of the Medium Industry Bank (MIB) and the Small Industry
Bureau. These efforts were initially confined to the provision of financial
assistance and extension services through MIB, and a statutory requirement
enacted in 1965 that commercial banks direct at least 30% of their total
lending to SMI enterprises. In recognition of SMI's important role in
generating export earnings and employment outside the main urban areas, the
Government subsequently enacted several measures (in addition to incentives
common to industries of all sizes) to assist SMI. These included, inter
alia: (a) the establishment, in 1962, of the National Federation of Medium
Industry Cooperatives (NFMIC), recently renamed the Korea Federation of
Small Businesses (KFSB), an apex cooperative system; (b) the creation in the
early 1970s of industrial estates, and particularly specialized single-trade
estates catering to SMI enterprises with a view to enabling them to take
advantage of economies of scale and common infrastructures and facilities;
and (c) in 1971, as part of the Saemaeul (New Community) Movement, the
establishment of small factories in rural areas with the main objective of
providing off-farm employment.
35.       The three main sources of finance for SMI are:
(a)  IIIB, which provides both short-term and long-term credits
in domestic and foreign currencies;
(b) the Citizens National Bank (CNB) which makes small domestic
currency loans to individuals, households and enterprises
in the unorganized subsector of small business; and
(c) the commercial banking network, which is the principal
source of short-term working capital loans for SMI.
The Small Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry plays a
central regulatory role and formulates and implements policies in the SMI
sector; the Korean Federation of Small Businesses serves as the apex institu-
tion for the nationwide network of 164 SMI cooperatives, and performs impor-
tant duties including assistance in arranging credit, disseminating technical
information, providing marketing services and maintaining quality standards.
36.       As of June 30, 1977, total outstanding loans to SMI from MIB, CNB and
commercial banking sources amounted to W 1,145 billion, of which the banking



- 10 -
system accounted for 61%, MIB for 22% and CNB 17%. In addition, the Credit
Guarantee Fund, a public institution, issues guarantees to enable small
entrepreneurs who do not possess adequate collateral to borrow from commer-
cial banks. Over the past three years, loans to SMI by the banking system
accounted for 35% of all loans to the industrial sector, which, compared
with SMI's share of 32% of industrial value added, suggests that SMI enter-
prises have had good access to financing, relative to larger enterprises.
37.       Nothwithstanding the considerable success of the Government's
efforts to help industry in the past, it is re-examining some of its
policies and institutional framework, with a view to SMI's further strengthen-
ing. Some of the measures being contemplated are: (a) the reorganization of
the administrative machinery involved in SMI; (b) the reorganization and
strengthening of the existing SMI cooperatives system; (c) the review of the
existing extension services system (which at present relies essentially on
MIB's Extension Services Department) with a view to facilitating the transfer
and introduction of appropriate technologies; (d) mergers of SMI enterprises
to achieve economies of scale; and (e) increasing the financial resources
available to SMI.
38.      The prospects for Korean SMI are good.    It is expected to maintain
its share of manufacturing value added at 30-32% and its share of fixed
manufacturing investment of 20-22%. Assuming the growth target of 9.2%
for Korea's economy is achieved for the Fourth Five-Year Plan period (1977-81),
with an annual growth rate of 14.2% of the manufacturing sector, fixed
investment in SMI is projected by MIB to rise from W 172 billion in 1977 to
W 300 billion in 1981, representing an annual increase in monetary terms of
about 15%.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
39.       A staff Appraisal Report entitled "Staff Appraisal Report of the
Medium Industry Bank" (No. 1797-KO dated November 30, 1977) is being dis-
tributed separately. Supplementary project data are provided in Annex III.
Negotiations were held in Washington from November 23 to 28, 1977 with a
Korean delegation led by Mr. H. K. Kang, Counselor at the Embassy of the
Republic of Korea in Washington.
40.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's second to the MIB.    The
Bank's first loan of $30.0 million (No. 1175-KO) was made in November 1975
and has been fully committed. MIB's performance during the past two years
has been highly satisfactory.
MIB's Legal Framework and Scope of Activities
41.       MIB was established in 1961 under its own Act as a government-owned
specialized development finance institution to promote and assist small and
medium-scale industries. The MIB Act, as successively amended, sets out the
broad framework for its policies, activities and administration. ln adddition



- 11 -
MIB is subject, with the exception of the specific provisions of the MIB Act,
to the General Banking Act and the supervision of the Superintendent of Banks
in connection with its commercial banking activities. As a specialized
financial institution, MIB also comes under the broad supervision of the
Ministry of Finance. MIB operates within the ambit of government policies but
enjoys adequate autonomy in its operational decisions.
42.       Within Korea's development banking system, MIB occupies a median
position between, at one end, the government-owned Korea Development Bank
(KDB) and the privately-owned Korea Development Finance Corporation (KDFC)
which concentrate on relatively large enterprises and, at the other end
of the institutional spectrum, the government-owned CNB which operates pri-
marily in the unorganized subsector of small-scale enterprises and provides
consumer Joans and small domestic currency loans to firms of an individual,
household or cottage type. The MIB Act confines its financing to enterprises
meeting the official definition of SMI, i.e. those with total assets not
exceeding W 500 million or with less than 300 employees. MIB assists both
small and medium-scale enterprises and its lending policy, in line with the
Government's SMI policy, does not differentiate between these two cate-
gories./l Whereas the CNB, as noted above, concentrates on the unorganized/
traditional segment of small industries, MIB's normal business focus is on
the organized/modern segment. Further, in view of the fact that the CNB is
not authorized under its charter to deal in foreign exchange, MIB in practice
is the sole institutional source of foreign currency financing for Korean SMI
enterprises.
Organization and Management
43.       MIB is a well-managed and well-organized institution, with a
competent staff. Apart from its head office, consisting of 17 departments,
it has a nationwide network of 65 branches and 13 deposit offices which
enables it to reach SMI firms throughout the country. As of June 30, 1977,
its staff totaled 3,533, of whom 77% worked in the branch network. Staff
training is methodical. Staff turnover has increased in recent years but
remains within manageable proportions.
44.       MIB's management structure consists of a Board of Policy and a
Board of Directors. The former deals with broad policy matters and comprises
/1  This definition of SMI in terms of either employment or asset size actually
leaves open the possibility for some capital-intensive projects to
qualify for financing by MIB as long as they meet the employment size
limit. This may have happened in the past when the asset limit was
fixed at the somewhat unrealistic level of W 50 million (about $100,000).
It is expected, however, that with the higher asset limit adopted in
1977 most projects financed by MIB will qualify under both criteria.
Based on these new criteria more than 95% of the loans committed by MIB
in 1976 complied with both the employment and asset limits.



- 12 -
seven members including MIB's President (as Chairman) and designated represen-
tatives of relevant government departments/agencies and of cooperatives and
small entrepreneurs. The latter is the principal executive body and comprises
MIB's President (as Chairman), its Deputy-President and five Directors, all
of whom are full-time MIB executives with the five Directors each assuming
direct managerial responsibility over three to four departments. MIB's
President, Mr. Sang Jin Nam, a former Vice-Minister of Finance, has consider-
able experience in financing and banking. He provides MIB with strong
leadership.
Operations and Developmental Impact.
45.       Apart from term finance (in both foreign and domestic currencies)
MIB provides short-term working capital loans and other commercial banking
facilities (e.g. deposits and letters of credit) to SMI enterprises. MIB is
the predominant source of term finance, and virtually the sole source of
foreign exchange loans, for SMI. As of June 30, 1977, MIB's clients totaled
over 15,000, or almost 70% of the total number (about 22,000) of SMI units
operatinlg in Korea, reflecting MIB's extensive coverage of the sub-sector.
As of the same date, MIB's total outstanding loan portfolio amounted to
W 266 billion ($548 million equivalent), of which 31% represented equipment
term loans and the balance, working capital loans. MIB's disbursements for
term loans are estimated to have financed about 23% of total fixed investment
in the SMI sub-sector over the past three years. MIB's projects are heavily
export-oriented, with about 55% of the output of its foreign exchange borrowers
expected to be sold on overseas markets. Data on a representative sample of
projects show financial and economic rates of return generally exceeding 20%
and 30% respectively. The average size of recent equipment term loans is
W 16 million ($33,000 equivalent) for domestic currency and $125,000 for
foreign currency, which indicates that MIB's financing to a satisfactory
extent has been oriented to smaller enterprises, as opposed to the medium-
sized ones.
46.       With a view to broadening its developmental impact in support of
general Government policies and programs, MIB formulated a development
program for 1976-77 at the time the first Bank loan to it was made. It
included inter alia:
(a)  increasing the proportion of its lending to areas outside Seoul
and Busan;
(b)  expanding the scope of its technical and extension services,
including in-plant consultancy services; and
(c)  stepping up efforts to undertake sector studies, feasibility
and market studies on selected SMI activities, with a view to
identifying suitable investment opportunities and/or improving the
operation of existing industries.
47.       MIB has made commendable progress in achieving these goals.     Its
lending in the past two years has shown a significant shift away from Seoul
and Busan, the two main industrial centers. MIB financing has accounted for
approximately one half of all small factories established in rural areas



- 13 -
since 1973 under the Saemaeul Movement. Apart from its financing, MIB has
been active in providing technical assistance and extension services
to SMI firms through its Extension Services Department. MIB has also
conducted a number of useful studies on specific problems being encountered
in a number of subsectors in which it is active e.g. textiles and metals.
48.       Having by and large achieved the developmental objectives it had
set out in 1975, MIB has formulated a new development strategy for 1978-79
which includes: (a) a continuing effort at improving the geographic disper-
sal of its financing; (b) an emphasis on assisting a greater number of
small, labor-intensive projects; (c) intensified assistance to small projects
within the Saemaeul Program; and (d) intensification of research, including
feasibility studies and market studies for selected SMI activities.
Policies and Procedures
49.       To supplement the broad policy guidelines contained in its Act,
IIIB has adopted a Policy Statement outlining in more specific terms its
operating and financial policies and procedures. In addition, an Opera-
tional Manual, periodically revised, spells out in more detail the opera-
tional and administrative procedures. MIB's appraisal standards are satis-
factory. Its project supervision work is sound and effective for the type
of enterprises (i.e. small enterprises) being financed, as reflected in the
good quality of its loan portfolio. MIB's procurement and disbursement
practices are efficient. It usually requires that import procurement be
based on three or more competitive quotations from foreign suppliers, and
its staff carefully checks the price and suitability of the equipment in
question.
Financial Position and Performance
50.       As of June 30, 1977, MIB's total assets stood at W 378 billion
($780 million equivalent), of which 70% represented the outstanding loan
portfolio. MIB's capital structure has been considerably strengthened in
the past two years with an increase of W 10 billion in its share capital as
a result of an agreement reached between the Government, MIB and the Bank
during negotiations for the first Bank loan. MIB's net worth as of June 30,
1977, amounted to W 21 billion, compared to W 5 billion at end-1975. Its
financial position is sound, with a long-term debt/equity ratio of 7.4:1 (as
against a contractual limit of 10:1), a current ratio of 1.12:1 as of the
above-mentioned date, and a debt service cover around 1.2 for the past three
years. MIB's profitability is modest, with a return (before tax and interest
payments) averaging 8% of total assets and net income averaging 7.5% of
equity in the three-year period 1974-76. This relatively low profitability
does not reflect institutional inefficiency or an insufficient gross interest
rate spread./A Rather it reflects the fact that MIB, as a public development
finance institution, undertakes a broad range of developmental functions (e.g.
extension services at a nominal fee and research activities) and maintains a
/a MIB's gross interest rate spread stood at about 4% in 1976 which is
adequate.



- 14 -
large countrywide network of branches to collect savings from small depos-
itors; it also results from the high overhead usually associated with small
business lending.
51.       MIB's loan portfolio is exceptionally sound.    As of June 30, 1977,
total arrears of principal and interest (for both short and long-term loans)
amounted to W 9.2 billion representing 3.5% of the total outstanding port-
folio. The ratio of loan collections has averaged 92% for equipment loans
and 99% for working capital loans in recent years. This is a remarkable
achievement considering the magnitude of MIB's portfolio (about 40,000
accounts for some 15,000 clients) and the fact that MIB operates in the
small business sector in which risks are high. The good repayment record of
MIB's clients is partly attributable to the excellent performance of the
Korean SMI subsector over the past several years.
Business and Financial Prospects
52.       MIB expects to expand its commitments annually by about 25% for
equipment term loans and 30% for working capital loans over the five-year
period 1977-81. This would gradually increase MIB's share in fixed SMI
investment from 23% as at present to 33% in 1981. MIB's total assets are
forecast to grow from W 340 billion at year-end 1976 to W 1,080 billion in
1981, with the total outstanding loan portfolio growing from W 244 billion
to W 784 billion. MIB's financial position, as projected, would remain
sound, with the current ratio improving from 1.12 to 1.31, the debt service
cover from 1.2 to 1.4 and the long-term debt/equity remaining within the
10:1 limit during the projection period. MIB's total debt equity ratio,
taking into account its short-term borrowings, stands at around 26:1 at the
moment. This is expected to decline to about 22:1 by 1981. However, this
indebtedness is not excessive for an institution which is heavily involved in
commercial banking operations and obtains a substantial proportion of its
resources from deposits. MIB's earnings performance is expected to improve
marginally. The quality of MIB's portfolio is expected to remain sound.
53.       The Government has indicated that it would make available to
MIB adequate long-term won resources, through both budgetary allocations and
the NIF, to enable MIB to sustain its volume of lending in the next few
years. On the foreign currency side, MIB is likely to need over the 1977-81
period about $200 million which it hopes to borrow mainly from the Bank and
the Asian Development Bank. The proposed Bank loan of $55 million is
expected to cover over one half of MIB's foreign currency commitments over
the two-year period 1978-79.
Main Features of Loan
54.       Component for Financing Projects Addressed to the Alleviation of
Urban Poverty. The first Bank loan to MIB has adequately achieved the spe-
cific objective of enabling MIB to reach smaller industrial projects which,
owing to their size, are not usually financed by the other two Korean finan-
cial intermediaries which the Bank is assisting, namely, KDB and KDFC. Under
that loan, the average size of MIB's subloans averaged $210,000, the cost of
subprojects $0.4 million, the total assets of subborrowers $0.6 million and



- 15 -
the gross capital cost per job $8,700. The foregoing data indicate that MIB's
subborrowers are considerably smaller and its subprojects much more labor-
intensive than those financed by KDB and KDFC. It is important that under the
proposed loan MIB should continue or even intensify its endeavor to reach
smaller enterprises (in terms of total assets) and more labor-intensive
projects (as measured by the capital/labor ratio). This would be consistent
with both MIB's own emphasis on assisting a larger number of small entrepre-
neurs and the Government's objective of contributing to the alleviation of
poverty through the financing of labor-intensive productive projects. Toward
that objective, a component of $20 million (or 36% of the loan amount of
$55 million) would be earmarked for financing specifically: (a) projects
creating employment at a gross capital cost per job not greater than $6,000;
or (b) enterprises whose fixed assets do not exceed $250,000 equivalent
(Section 2.02 (a) of the draft Loan Agreement). The $6,000 capital/labor
limit is approximately equivalent to the Bank's urban poverty threshold for
Korea ($5,120 based on 1976 prices, adjusted for inflation during 1978-79, the
expected period of commitment of the proposed loan).
55.       Other Features, Terms and Conditions of the Loan.     Apart from direct
imports, the proceeds of the loan would be utilized by MIB to finance the
foreign exchange component of domestically procured capital goods estimated
at 60%. The long-term debt/equity limit of 10:1, set under the previous Bank
loan, would be maintained (Section 4.06 of the draft Loan Agreement). It is
also recommended that the free limit for subloans be maintained at $0.5 million
(Section 2.02 (b) of the draft Loan Agreement). The ceiling of $1 million on
individual subloans and the limit of W 600 million on total assets of eligible
subborrowers, set under the previous Bank loan, would be raised to $1.5 million
and W 1 billion respectively (Section 2.02 (a) of the draft Loan Agreement),
to bring them in line with a recent Government decision to relax the eligibility
criteria of MIB's foreign exchange subborrowers (Section 2.02 of the draft
Loan Agreement). MIB intends to relend the loan proceeds at a rate that would
give it a spread of two percentage points, with the foreign exchange risk
borne by subborrowers. This spread is in line with the practice of government-
owned development institutions such as NIB and KDB in relending the proceeds
of their borrowings from institutional sources (such as the ADB and the Bank)
and is adequate to cover the costs associated with the processing of foreign
currency lending. The other terms and conditions of the loan would be similar
to those of recent Bank loans to DFCs, including a flexible amortization
schedule conforming substantially to the aggregate of the repayment schedules
of subloans.
Benefits and Risks
56.       The continued growth of SMI in Korea is an important element of
Korea's development strategy, especially as it relates to employment creation
in the country as a whole and the deconcentration of industry. MIB's
experienced and competent staff and its relations with the Government and
business community make it a particularly suitable channel for providing
finance and technical assistance to SMI enterprises.
57.        For the future, MIB's growth is not expected to be constrained by
lack of demand for the financing and other services it offers. The main
objective of the proposed Bank loan, in addition to the provision of finance



- 16 -
for investment in SMI, is to assist MIB in expanding its operations on an
economically and financially sound basis by improving its appraisal standards
and financial structure. Further, MIB's intention of directing a greater
share of its lending for the establishment and expansion of SMI enterprises
in the areas other than the Seoul and Busan industrial complexes will help in
the realization of more equitable regional distribution of jobs and income.
In sum, the proposed loan will increase the flow of resources to SMI, con-
tribute to greater regional dispersal of investment and strengthen the
capability of MIB to service the needs of the SMI sector in Korea. The
project does not entail any unusual risks.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
58.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and MIB, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Korea and the Bank, the Report of
the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a draft resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The Loan and Guarantee Agreements follow the normal pattern of Bank agreements
for loans of this kind. The special features of this loan are described in
Section III of Annex III of this Report.
59.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Arti-
cles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
60.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /1
Agricultural Sector
Loan No. 795      Yong San Gang Irrigation Project; $33.0 Million Loan
Credit No. 283    and $15.0 Million Credit of February 2, 1972; Effective
Date: September 15, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project, located in one of the most drought-prone areas of
Korea, provides four storage dams, canal systems and land development to
irrigate 33,700 ha. The project was delayed initially by modifications
in the design of the dams and later when rapid inflation outpaced the
allocation of local funds. The dams have now been completed and about
19,000 ha was irrigated in 1977. Good progress is being made on other
works; these works are expected to be completed in mid-1978, about
18 months behind schedule. Consequently, the Closing Date has been
extended from September 30, 1977 to December 31, 1978. The project cost
is estimated at about $151 million compared to $88.6 million at appraisal
but because of increases in rice and barley prices, the economic rate of
return is expected to be close to the appraisal estimate of 13%.
Loan No. 942      Seeds Project; $7.0 Million Loan of November 16, 1973;
Effective Date: April 24, 1974; Closing Date: December 31,
1978
The project consists of: (a) the installation of five field crop
seed processing and storage facilities; (b) farm machinery for seed pro-
duction; (c) procurement of seasonal seed inventories through the operation
of a revolving fund; (d) seed testing laboratories and equipment; (e) crop
research (financed in part by USAID); (f) feasibility studies for irriga-
tion and area development; and (g) technical assistance. The necessary
legislative and administrative action for revising the Seed Law and estab-
lishing an "Office for Seed Production and Distribution" has been taken.
Project implementation, although one year behind the appraisal schedule, is
proceeding satisfactorily. Project cost (OSPD/NAPIO components) have increased
from the appraisal estimates of about $14.0 million to about $35.0 million.
Disbursement has been somewhat slower than expected at appraisal but is
expected to substantially improve in FY78.
Loan No. 994      Integrated Agricultural Products Processing Project;
$13.0 Million Loan of June 7, 1974; Effective Date:
March 19, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This project provides long-term funds to the Agriculture and
Fishery Development Corporation (AFDC) for onlending to subborrowers in the

progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-

them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

private sector for the purpose of integrating on-farm production of fruits and
vegetables with modern hygienic processing facilities, using land that is
presently idle or underutilized. The vegetables and fruits involved are
mainly asparagus, shiitake (oak mushroom), spinach, mushroom, strawberry and
peach. Implementation of the project as a whole has been slow. This is
mainly because loan demand for processing facilities, specifically included
in the project and which account for nearly 70% of total project cost, has
been negligible. Changes in market conditions which have been primarily
responsible for the lack of demand for such facilities are expected to
persist during the project period. Accordingly, it is essential that the
project scope be widened to allow AFDC to lend for other agricultural
facilities. If the revised project scope proposed by AFDC is agreed to by
the Bank, AFDC is confident that this would accelerate project lending so
that implementation of the project, already behind schedule, would not be
unduly delayed.  Disbursements, as of October 31, 1977, were about 16% of
the total loan.
Loan No. 1193     Second Integrated Dairy Development Project;
$15.0 Million Loan of June 4, 1976; Effective Date:
November 11, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The project consists of:   (a) the establishment of about 450 new
dairy farms; (b) the continuation of the development begun as part of the
First Integrated Dairy Beef Project on about 400 dairy farms; (c) the expan-
sion of existing processing plants, the diversification of their production,
the establishment of 2 milk collection centers and 50 small milk cooling
units and the construction of a milk products plant at Yeongnam; and (d) the
expansion of technical services for both farm development and milk processing.
Loan No. 1216     Rural Infrastructure Project; $60.0 Million Loan of which
Loan No. 1218T    $40.0 Million Third Window; Effective Date:   June 4. 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Project implementation is proceeding very well. The Fuelwood
component has been completed, while the Roads and Bridges, Water Supply and
Rural Electrification components will be completed by the end of 1977. Minor
Irrigation has experienced some delays, mainly the result of budgetary
shortages and a cost overrun of 18%, but should be substantially completed by
the end of 1978. Upland Reclamation is proceeding in accordance with the
revised time schedule and will be completed in 1978. Project monitoring and
reporting continue to be satisfactory and a good start has been made on the
Hydrologic Services Study and a major project evaluation study. The estimated
cost of the project is likely to be 16% above the appraisal estimate, mostly
as a result of cost overruns for Minor Irrigation and Rural Electrification
and an increase in the size of the Water Supply component. Disbursements are
practically in line with appraisal estimates.

performance in using the loan has been highly satisfactory.
Loan No. 1145    Fifth Korea Development Finance Corporation Project;
$55.0 Million Loan of July 23, 1975; Effective Date:
September 5, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The loan covers about half the KDFC's foreign exchange require-
ments through the end of 1977. The proceeds are used to finance direct
imports of machinery and equipment, and the foreign exchange component
of domestically produced capital goods and of civil works. About 94% of the
loan proceeds have already been disbursed. KDFC's performance in using
the loan has been highly satisfactory.

Loan No. 1466    Heavy Machinery Project; $80.0 Million Loan of
June 23, 1977; Effective Date:/1; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
The project is designed to manufacture most of the equipment
required for power generation, steel mills, and chemical and petrochemical
plants. It consists of (a) foundry and forge shops, (b) fabrication shops,
(c) machine shops, (d) assembly and test shops, (e) support facilities,
(f) other auxiliary facilities, and (g) technical assistance. Project imple-
mentation is on schedule: preparation of detailed equipment specifications has
been completed, prequalification of suppliers and distributing of tender
documents is well underway, and order placement for most items will begin
shortly. Initial site preparation work is presently 70% complete.
Education Sector
Loan No. 906      Second Education. Project; $23.0 Million Loan and
Credit No. 394    $20.0 Million Credit of June 13, 1973; Effective Date:
September 10, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project provides equipment for, and extensions to, 85 educa-
tional institutions at secondary, post secondary and university levels. It
also includes preinvestment studies on health and management education.
The project execution is now about two years behind schedule. The principal
causes of delay have been slow equipment procurement owing to staff shortages
in the Office of Supply (OSROK) and an internal Korean review of procurement
procedures. Implementation is now proceeding satisfactorily. Covenant
requirements under the Development Credit Agreements are largely met. The
project is now expected to be completed by mid-1979, which requires an
extension of the Closing Date.
Loan No. 1096     Third Education Project; $22.5 Million Loan of March 31,
1975; Effective Date: June 6, 1975; Closing Date: June 30,
1980
The project includes assistance for extensions and equipping of
nine institutions (technical, agricultural and fisheries) under the Ministry
of Education (MOE) and seven vocational training institutes under the Office
of Labor Affairs (OLA). Project implementation is about nine months behind
schedule mainly due to earlier difficulties with counterpart funds. These
shortages resulted in part from the delay of the Second Education Project and
ensuing bunching of financial requirements. However, substantial progress
has been made and disbursements are on schedule. All sites have been acquired
and site layouts and sketch plans have been approved. Five institutions are
under construction and one institution has been completed. About 60% of the
equipment has been tendered. No cost overrun is anticipated at this time.
Both MOE and OLA project units are functioning satisfactorily.

Closing Date:  December 31, 1978
The project forms part of the first phase of the planned development
of the Bomun Lake resort near Kyongju. It provides for a multipurpose dam;
an irrigation system for about 1,200 ha; improvement and expansion of the
water supply and sewerage and solid waste disposal systems for the city of
Kyongju and the resort area; installation of electrical supply and telecom-
munication facilities for the resort area; the construction and/or realign-
ment of about 57 km of roads, infrastructure, including storm water drainage,
environmental sanitation, community facilities, and a golf course; a school
for training hotel personnel; and a feasibility study for the development
of tourism on Cheju Island. Construction of the dam, work on the irrigation
system and civil works for the Kyongju City water supply and sewerage component
have been completed. Work on the electricity component is progressing well
and is expected to be completed shortly. Work on the water supply and
sewerage system in the Bomun area which was delayed because of groundwater
investigations has just started as has work on the golf course. Road work
in the project area was delayed due to the shortage of local funds, but is
now progressing satisfactorily. Construction of the first hotel at Bomun
Lake has started and negotiations for a second are well advanced. About 43%
of the loan has been disbursed and project completion is now scheduled for
December 1978.
Regional Development
Loan No. 1070     Secondary Cities Regional Project; $15.0 Million
Loan of January 15, 1975; Effective Date: August 18,
1975; Closing Date: March 31, 1979
Implementation of the Secondary Cities Regional Project is pro-
ceeding satisfactorily. Two housing sites and a city market have essentially
been completed. Progress in the remaining five subprojects is nearly on
schedule. Tenders are being invited for the sixth subproject. Allocation of
housing plots has been made at the Gwangju site; there was a strong demand
for such plots. Efforts to cross-subsidize smaller plots for lower-income
families through the sale of larger plots have been most successful. Alloca-
tion of plots at the two other housing units is underway. The project is



ANNEX II
Page 9 of 11 pages
nearly a year behind appraisal schedule, mainly due to delays in fulfilling
conditions of effectiveness and establishing the Gwangju Regional Development
Unit. Total project costs are now estimated at $22.6 million compared to the
appraisal estimate of $25.0 million. A surplus of nearly $2.0 million is
anticipated in the loan amount, mainly due to devaluation of the won in
December 1974. As of October 31, 1977, disbursement was 41% of the loan
amount.

Maritime and Port Authority (KMPA) is being adequately staffed, but there has
been a delay ir. adopting operational and financial procedures recommended by
consultants appointed to advise KMPA on these matters. Proposals for this
work, from three consulting firms, are now being evaluated. The financial
situation at the project ports is satisfactory and will be further improved
if the proposed tariff increases in January 1978 are effected.
Loan No. 956     Second Highway Project; $47.0 Million Loan of January 25
1974; Effective Date: April 4, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978
The works, consisting of construction, chiefly on new alignments,
of about 130 km of highways and paving, chiefly on existing alignments, of a
further 634 km of national highways were completed on schedule and the high-
ways opened to traffic in October 1975. The cost, in US dollar equivalent,
exceeded the estimate by about 5%. Feasibility studies for future projects
of about 1,000 km of roads were started in August 1975, followed by detailed
engineering. Delay occurred in setting up a new nationwide highway maintenance
organization but the organization has now been established in accordance with
decrees published in June 1975. All the maintenance offices have been
constructed and staffed and equipment procured under the loan. The Government
has been requested to increase the budgetary allocation to enable an adequate
program of periodic maintenance to be carried out. By the end of October 1977,
disbursements were above 97%, but the Closing Date has been extended by a year
to use the balance in the loan account for procurement of spare parts needed
for the maintenance equipment.
