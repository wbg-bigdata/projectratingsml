(Loans 1507 and 1749-KO)
PREFACE
This project completion report covers the evolution of the Small and
Medium Industry Bank (SMIB) of Korea and the Bank's relationship with it,
particularly over the period 1980-84. The report focuses on subprojects
financed under Loan 1507-KO which was closed on December 31, 1982 and
Loan 1749-KO which was closed on December 31, 1983. This PCR was prepared by
the IDF Division of the Projects Department, East Asia and Pacific Regional
Office, on the basis of a mission to Korea and a draft PCR and additional
information furnished by SMIB.
In accordance with the revised project performance reporting
procedures this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion
Report was sent to the Borrower for couments. A copy of their response
is included as an Attachment.

PMOJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA: THE SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRY BANK
(Loans 1507 and 1749-KO)
HIGHLIGHTS
This report reviews the evolution of the Small and Medium Industry
Bank (SMIB) and the Bank's relationship with it particularly over the period
1980-84. A PCR and a Project Performance Audit Report on Bank's first loan
(No. 1175-KO) to SMIB covering developments up to 1979 were issued in 1980 and
1983, respectively. Both these documents concluded that the objectives of
that Bank project were satisfactorily realized. Special attention is given in
this PCR to projects financed under the second and third loans (Ln. 1570-KO
for US$55 million and Ln. 1749-KO for US$60 million).
Following up on the Bank's first loan to SMIB, the objectives of
Lns. 1507 and 1749-KO were to: (a) transfer foreign currency resources for
the development of SMI enterprises, with a particular emphasis on reaching
smaller and labor-intensive projects; (b) contribute to further institution
building of SMIB; and (c) support SMIB in its efforts to realize its major
development objectives incorporated in its Development Strategy such as
geographic dispersal and the Saemaul Program (para. 3.03). These objectives
have been largely achieved. A total of 550 subprojects with a total invest-
ment of W 119.4 billion (US$201.1 million) were financed under the two loans
(para. 4.04), resulting in the creation of about 10,300 new jobs (para 4.09).
Financial results of subprojects have been adequate (para 4.08) and 'AIB's
portfolio has remained relatively trouble-free (para 4.08). A component
included under each project to reach smaller enterprises and labor-intensive
projects elicited a greater response than expected as total lending for this
purpose under each loan surpassed the targeted amounts (para 4.09).
Since SMIB was already a well-managed organization at the time of
the first Bank loan, its involvement with the Bank resulted in some modest
further institution building. As under the first project, SMIB continued to
follow satisfactory operational procedures (paras. 5.03, 5.04 and 5.05).
These procedures were further strengthened by introduction of a systematic
staff training system under the two projects under review. SMIB's branch
network expansion has been carefully planned and it has maintained the quality
of its management and staff despite its considerable growth over the past
several years. SMIB has generally maintained a satisfactory financial
performance and position (paras. 6.07 and 6.08). SMIB's portfolio is in a
satisfactory condition; adequate provisions for possible bad debts have been
maintained. It has been in compliance with the long term debt/equity ratio of
10:l, covenanted under the Loan Agreement, having received additional equity
contributions from the Government as needed.
The major governmental priority outlined in SMID's Development Stra-
tegy, formulated in consultations with the Bank, was to disperse industries
from the Seoul and Busan areas (para. 4.06). Toward this objective, project
subloans to Seoul and Busan were limited to 50% of the loan amount under Ln.



- v -
1507-K0 and 451 under Ln. 1749-K0.  Actual figures were 481 and 331, respec-
tively, and thus well within the target.
Having achieved the major objectives of the second and third
projects, SMIB's goals under its most recent Bank loan, Ln. 2515-KO are:
(a) to reduce arrears, and (b) to define its role in a liberalized financial
sector. The arrears reduction program aims at maintaining arrears to a level
of 31 of portfolio during 1985-89, which would be remarkably good for an
institution dealing with the relatively risky SMI sectir. In order to help in
the definition of the role of a specialized SMI bank in a liberalising
financial system, and to examine whether SMIB should develop alternative
sources of funding and broaden its clientele and the financial services it
provides a study has been commissioned. The study which would review this
issue will be completed by July 30, 1986.
From the review of performance of Ins. 1507-K0 and 1749-KO, the
following lessons emerged:
(a) although the objectives of the two loans were fully achieved, with
hindsight the Bank could have been more active in supporting the
institution building of SMIB. For example, the study on the future
of SMIB, which is to be implemented under the SMI loan (Ln. 2515-K0)
could have been incorporated under the two earlier loans. In
addition, some measures to reduce SMIBs substantial reliance on the
Government for term resources, could have encouraged SMIB to move
towards self reliance for term resources (for example, commercial
borrowing and other longer term financial instruments);
(b) despite the fact that the overall performance of the subprojects
were satisfactory, the ex-post ERRs of a number of subprojects fell
below SMIB's estimates (para. 4.09).  It is an indication of SMIB's
economic appraisal, generally, being optimistic. The Bank could
have focussed its attention to making suggestions for improving this
aspect. Fortunately, however, this optimism in economic evaluation
has not resulted in the financing of any unviable projects;
(c) prepayments to SMIB by relatively a large number of subborrowers
under the two loans was prompted by subborrowers' perception of
continued decline in the value of Won vis-a-vis US dollar and their
reluctance to carry the exchange risk on their subloans
(para. 4.08). In other words, the effective carrying cost of Bank
funds to the end users far exceeded the cost of domestic currency
funds used to repay the Bank subloans; invariably the domestic funds
carried interest rates lower than the free market rates. In recent
years this issue has become quite serious and has adversely affected
the rate of utilization of Bank loans for SMI enterprises. Consi-
dering that there is a role for the Bank to play, both in the SMI
subsector and institution building of SMIB and CNB, a workable
mechanism should be developed so as to eliminate the bias against
foreign exchange loans; and

(d) besides its sound appraisal quality, the success of SMIB in devel-
oping and financing SMI enterprises is, to a large extent, a func-
tion of (a) its large branch network and (b) its commercial banking
activities which enable 3MIB to maintain a constant close contact
with its borrowers. This provides in most cases an early warning of
potential operational and debt service problems. This institu-
tional model could be reflected by the Bank in its SMI operations in
other countries.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA: THE SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRY BANK
(Loans 107 and 1149-KO)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Project Context.  The Bank's relationship with SKIS dates back to
1975 when the first Bank loan (No. 1175-KO) for US$30 million war approved.
The first loan was followed by five additional loans to SMIS amounting to
US$304 million: Ln. 1507-KO, 1977, for US$55 millions Ln. 1749-KO, 1979, for
US$60 million; Ln. 2004-KO, 1981, for U8$60 million, Ln. 2213-KO, 1982, for
US$29 million (a component of a US$70 million loan for the Small and Medium
Machinery Industry Project) and Ln. 2515-KO, 1985, for US$70 million (a com-
ponent of a US$111 million loan for the Small and Medium Industry Project).
All these loans were to assist the development of the country's SMI sector.
In accordance with the general guidelines for preparing PCRs, the present
report covers the evolution of SMIS and the Bank's relationship with it par-
ticularly over the last five years (1980-84), and focusses on the subprojects
financed under the second and third loans (Ln. 1507-KO and Ln. 1749-KO).
1.02      Evaluation of Results of Previous Bank Assistance.  In 1983 OED
issued a Project Performance Audit Report (No. 4577 dated June 23, 1983)
covering first Bank loan (Ln. 1175-KO) to SMIB, on tha basis of a PCR done in
1980.
1.03      Status of Bank loans to SKIS is given below:

II. ENVIRONMENT
The Industrial Sector
2.01      Rapid industrialization has been the cornerstone of Korea's long-
term economic growth. At 15%, the growth rate of Korea's manufacturing sector
ranked among the highest in the world between 1960 and 1983. Dynamic growth
has been led in particular by manufactured exports, which primarily consisted
of light industrial goods in the early 1960s but today include a diverse range
of goods including steel products, electronics and chemicals.
2.02      During the 1960s Korea's development was associated with an inter-
ventionist approach by Government whose key policies included: comprehensive
export incentives; an extensive system of directed, concessional credit; and
substantial spending on human and physical infrastructure. This approach was
successful until the two oil crises in the 1970s when it was found that: the
promotion of heavy and chemical industries had led to an increase in debt and
excess capacity; directed credit for priority industries had crowded out a
large numbers of companies, particularly SMIs and forced them to resort to
informal credit markets; and despite the continuous emphasis on technology
diffusion and technical training, a wide gap had emerged between the
capabilities of smaller companies and the larger corporate groups that were
the main focus of Government attention.
2.03      Recognizing these weaknesses, the Government adopted a new approach,
emphasizing the bigger role of market mechanism, under the Fifth Five-Year
Plan (1982-86). Government is now committed to policies of industrial, trade
and financial liberalization. Given these initiatives the prospects for
further industrial development are bright provided that recovery in the OECD
countries can be strengthened.
SMI Sector
2.04      Small and Medium Industries (SMIs), which are defined as having
total employees of 50 to 700, depending on industries, with an assets ceiling
of W 4 billion to 8 billion, have played a significant though declining role
in Korea's industrialization. In 1963, SHIs accounted for 62% of manufactur-
ing jobs and for 50% of manufacturing value added compared to 541 and 361,
respectively in 1982. This decline occurred due to (a) the growth of success-
ful SMIs into large-scale firms taking advantage of economies of scale; and
(b) previous Government policies which hampered SMI access to credit and other
needed resources.
2.05      Recognizing these weaknesses the Government under its Fifth Five-
Year Plan (1982-86), adopted a new approach, aimed at strengthening the SMI
sector in the context of Government's broader objective of improving indus-
trial efficiency. Specific policy measures in support of SMIs include:
(a) financial assistance; (b) extension services, provided primarily by the
Small and Medium Industry Promotion Corporation (SMIPC); (c) promotion of
subcontracting, which remains underdeveloped and problem-prone; and (d) tech-
nology development assistance provided by institutions like the Korea



Technology Development Corporation, the Korea Technology Advancement Corpora-
tion and the Korea Institute of Economics and Technology.
2.06      Financial Assistance.  In the early 1960s, in addition to the
establishment of SMIB and CNB, the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund was set up to
guarantee debt repayment, earmarking 40% of total outstanding guarantees for
SMIs. City banks are expected to allocate 35% of their incremental loan
portfolio to SMIs every year, while regional banks are supposed to allocate
55Z. The Government has also set up the Small and Medium Industry Promotion
Fund (SMIPF) to help redress the neglect of SMIs in the allocation of credit
during the 1970s. SMIs can use the proceeds of the SMIPF to finance both
domestic and imported equipment. SMIPF, channeled mainly through SMIB,
accounted for about 10X of SMI capital investment in 1984.
III. SMIB'S ROLE AND BANK LOANS' OBJECTIVES
3.01      SMIB was incorporated under the Small and Medium Industry Act of
July, 1961 to extend financial and technical assistance to SMIs (as defined in
para 4.02). As a bank, it engages in commercial banking, including the mobi-
lization of deposits, issuance of credit and short-term lending for working
capital. As a development institution owned by the Government, it provides
long-term finance to its borrowers, the SMI sector in Korea. Like other
specialized institutions, SMIB is subject to the broad supervision of the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) whose approval is required for the revision of
SMIB's by-laws, operating manuals, annual plan of operations, and the appoint-
ment of top management. Regarding commercial operations, SMIB is further
subject to supervision by the Bank of Korea (BOK).
3.02      The Bank's association with SMIB dates back to 1974, when the Korean
Government submitted an application to the Bank for a first loan of US$30 mil-
lion. The loan was approved and signed in November 1975 and became effective
in January 1976. It was closed without an extension in March 1980. In June
1983 OED prepared a Project Performance Audit Report (Report No. 4577, dated
June 23, 1983) on the loan which was based on the first PCR on SMIB prepared
by the East Asia and Pacific Regional Office. The PCR and PPAR covered the
evolution of SKIB to 1979. The PPAR supported the conclusion of the PCR that
the Bank's objectives of resource transfer and institution building were
achieved successfully. It also pointed out that the appraisal goals for the
project which included employment creation, increased sales and exports were
attained. As an appropriate allocator of Bank resources to SMIs in Korea and
with its operational capability, SMIB was recommended for a new loan of US$55
million. The second loan (Ln. 1507-KO) was approved in December 1977 and
third loan (Ln. 1749-KO) of US$60.0 million in July 1979.
3.03      Loan Objectives.  The main objectives of the two loans were to:
(a) transfer foreign currency resources to SMIs with an emphasis on reaching
smaller enterprises and labor intensive projects; (b) continue institution
building, which had been remarkably enhanced under the first project; and
(c) help achieve objectives outlined in its Development Strategy such as
geographic dispersal and the Saemaul Program. SMIB's performance in achieving



these objectives has been satisfactory as brought out in the following
chapters of this PCR.
IV. UTILIZATION OF THE BANK LOANS
Rate of Utilization
4.01      Annex 1 gives the schedule of estimated and actual disbursement of
Lns. 1507 and 1749-KO. SMtB's utilization of these loans has been satisfac-
tory and both loans were committed and disbursed at a faster pace than esti-
mated at appraisal; small amounts (US$11,399 for Ln. 1507-KO and US$25,773 for
Ln. 1749-KO) were cancelled. The loans were closed on the original dates, as
stipulated in the loan agreements.
Subborrowers Characteristics
4.02      SMI in Korea were defined 21 by either total assets sizs or number
of employees at the time of processing Loans 1507-KO and 1749-K0._/ As the
two SMI criteria were alternatives, the type of clients qualifying under chis
definition could range from a labor-intensive enterprise with low total assets
to a very capital-intensive enterprise with a small number of employees. With
the ob3ective of demarcating SMIB customers from larger-scale ones who are
eligible to receive loans from the Korea Development Bank (KDB), the Bank
reached understandings with SMIB that financing from Lns. 1507-KO and 1749-KO
would be restricted to enterprises with total assets below W 1 billion. The
new ceiling was an increase from the W 600 million under the first SMIB Loan
(1175-KO), to bring it in line with the Covernment's decision increasing the
total assets limit for SMIs in 1977. SMIB was in compliance with this agree-
ment.
Subprojects Characteristics
4.03      Data on subprojects financed under Lns. 1507 and 1749-KO are
sunmmarized in Annex 2 and the list of these subprojects with some pertinent
details are given in Annexes 3 and 4. Ln. 1507-KO was used to finance
231 subprojects, of which 12 were "A" subprojects (above the free limit of
US$0.5 million) while Ln. 1749-KO was used to finance 319 subprojects, of
which 9 were "A" subprojects. These "A" subprojects were submitted to the
2/   In SMIB Act and Presidential Decree No. 38.
3/   For manufacturing the definitions were either maximum total assets size
of W 500 million or a maximum employment size of 300 workers (revised to
500 workers for selected industries in 1979.) According to Presidential
Decree (No. 11313) amended in 1983, the present criterion is the number
of regular employees, principally. For manufacturing the general limit
is 300 with exceptions up to 700 for some labor-intensive sub-sectors.
Further more, some industrial sub-sectors have restrictions on the size
of total assets, which vary from W 4 billion to W 8 billion.



Bank for prior review and approval. Specific comments were conveyed to SMIB
on only one subproject under Ln. 1507-KO  in respect of all the other sub-
projects, the original submissions were found satisfactory at that time. SMIB
considers the appraisal report review process to be worthwhile, but too time
consuming especially in case of 'A' subprojects. The free limit for both
loans were US$0.5 million. The maintenance of the limit did not imply any
dissatisfaction with SMIB's performance but rather reflected the recognition
that the US$0.5 million limit for the first loan was already high as ahown by
the very small number (4 out of 144) of "A" projects under the firitc loan.
The ceiling on subloans and size of subborrowers were US$1 million and
W 600 million, respectively, under the first loan. To take into account the
steady expansion of SMI these ceilings were revised to US$1.5 million and
W 1 billion, respectively, under Lns. 1507/1749-K0 (outside the special
component for small-scale enterprises and labor-intensive projects). The
average loan sizes under Lns. 1507/1749-K0 were US$238,000 and US$188,000,
respectively."' Expressed in Won, the average loan size of Ln. 1749-KO
becomes W 131.6 million, 13% higher than that of Ln. 1507-K0, reflecting the
considerable devaluation of the Won and economic growth during this period.
Taking inflation into account this indicates that SMIB catered to the needs of
smaller enterprises.
4.04      Total subproject costs amount#4 to W 49.5 billion (US$101.2 million)
for Ln. 1507-K0, and to W 69.9 billion '  (US$99.9 million) for Ln. 1749-KO,
of which on an average SMIB financed 63% and 69%, respectively (both domestic
and foreign costs). SMIB financing ranged from 25Z to nearly 97% for indivi-
dual subprojects. Subproject cost estimates of SMIB have been fairly accu-
rate; actual total project costs were within 2X of estimates for Ln. 1507-K0
and 9% for Ln. 1749-R0. Causes for major cost overruns/underruns are
explained in Annexes 3 and 4. The largest cost overrun was 39% due to an
increase of equipment cost. The largest cost underrun of 45% was attributed
to the scale-down of a project. Estimated subproject completion dates were
also satisfactory.  The longest delay of 15 months under pn. 1747-K0 was due
to slow delivery of equipment from the US. Procurement 6 of directly
imported equipment was mainly from Japan, accounting for about 80% under
Ln. 159Q-KO and 70% under Ln. 1749-K0 in terms of foreign currency expendi-
tures._7 This reliance on Japanese equipment was mainly due to the economic
proximity of the two countries.
4/   The average loan size under the first loan was US$212,000.
5/   Estimated on the basis of actual data for 220 subprojects (95Z of the
total) for Ln. 1507-K0 and 311 subproject (97%) for Ln. 1749-K0.  Actual
data for remaining subprojects were not available.
6/   SMIB does not insist on ICB; instead it requests its borrowers to obtain
more than two independent quotations from potential suppliers.
7/   The percentage for Ln. 1795-K0 was 77%.



- 6 -
4.05      Sectoral Distribution.  An analysis of the sector distribution of
subprojects financed under the two loans is given in Annex 5. Subprojects
were largely concentrated in two subsectors: (a) machinery/metal products
manufacturing; and (b) textiles. These subsectors together accounted for 41X
and 47X of the amounts of Lns. 1507/1749-KO, respectively. In comparison with
the first loan, which allocated 81X of the loan to these two subsectors,
SMIB's exposure in the two industries had been reduced reflecting the relative
importance of these industries in the SMI sector in terms of their value added
(43X for the two industries in 1982). The remaining portion was mainly
allocated to paper and chemical/petroleum subsectors. Since these were
priority, high growth industries, SMIB's concentration in them was justified.
4.06      Geographic distribution.  In accordance with Government policy, SMI8
tried to reduce the concentration of the industries in Seoul and Busan. The
targets stated in its Development Scrategy were to raduce the proportion of
financing for Seoul and Busan to 501 (under Ln. 1507-KO), and then to 45X
(under Ln. 1749-KO). The actual figures of 481 for Ln. 1507-KO, and 331 for
Ln. 1749-KO were well within those targets. Also in line with this emphasis,
SMIB had financed using its own resources on small rural projects under the
Samaeul program since 1974. By end-1981, 883 of these projects had been
supported by SMIB, with the total financing amounting to W 41.4 billion.,'
4.07      Component for Small-Scale and Labor Intensive Projects.  As part of
its resource transfer objective, the first Bank loan to SMIB attempted to
assist small industrial projects in Korea, which, due to their small size,
were usually not eligible for financing by other Bank-assisted financial
intermediaries namely, Korea Development Finance Corporation (KDFC, which
later became the Korea Long-Term Credit Bank) and Korea Development Bank
(KDB). After the first Bank loan, SMIB continued this attempt to reach
smaller enterprises and more labor-intensive projects. This was consistent
with the Bank's objective of contributing to the alleviation of poverty
through the financing of labor-intensive investment projects. Toward that
objective Ln. 1507-KO earmarked a component of US$20 million (361 of the total
loan amount) for: (a) projects that would create employment at a gross
capital cost per job not greater than US$6,000; or (b) enterprises with fixed
assets not exceeding US$250,000. The total amount financed under this compo-
nent reached US$24.6 million (45% of the total amount) exceeding the earmarked
amount by over 201. As the results of this component were considered to be
satisfactory, Ln. 1749-KO repeated the effort, earmarking US$25 million (421
of the total loan). The gross capital cost per job was increased to US$8,500
and the fixed assets limit became US$300,000. At project completion,
US$37.4 million (62% of the total loan) went to this component, again well
above target. It should be noted that the considerable increase of this
component under Ln. 1749-KO should be appropriately discounted to the extent
that the above-mentioned ceilings, when expressed in Won, shifted considerably
toward middle-scale industry due to the substantial devaluation of the Won
from 1979 to 1981. However, a Bank loan to the Citizens National Bank (CNB)

Saemaeul program was dropped.



-7-
in 1980, intensified efforts toward attainment of this objective since CNB was
established to deal with small business and consumers.
Operational and Economic Performance of Subprojects
4.08      Operational Performance.  Annexes 6 and 7 give operational details
of the subprojects financed under Lns. 15071)749-KO.  Under Ln. 1507-KO, total
sales generated by a sample of subprojects Z1 in the second year of operation
amounted to W 54.5 billion, exceeding the corresponding appraisal estimates
for the year by 27%. At the same time, actual profits fell short of projec-
tions by 10%9lor the same year. Performance of a sample of subprojects under
La. 1749-K0,-  was less successful.  Total sales of W 26.9 billion (US$38.5
million) in the second year were lower than the corresponding appraisal
estimates by 3X and actual profits fell short of projections by 42% reflecting
the depressed state of the economy after the second oil crisis. Reflecting
the difference in profit level of the two loans, repayment performance as of
end-1984 was satisfactory under Ln. 1507-KO, with only three subloans in
arrears, while there are 18 subloans in arrears under Ln. 1749-KO, including
nine of more than six months 1Annexes 8 and 9). Loan arrears on subprojects
financed under these loans - as percent of total loan amounts were 0.2% and
0.8%, respectively, which is a very acceptable range.  According to the more
recent data (as of July 10, 1985), 9 out of 21 defaulting subprojects under
the two loans have since become up to date while 11 of the remaining 12 are in
the process of legal actions, mainly auctions. Subborrowers who opted to
prepay the entire Bank subloans amounted to 35 and 34 for Lns. 1507 and 1749-
K0, respectively.  These prepayments were largely encouraged by substantial
devaluation of the Won over the period as subborrowers perceived a further
decline in the value of Won and tried to avoid further foreign currency
exchange risk losses. Total amounts outstanding under the two loans as of
end-November 1985 were US$12.3 million (22% of the total) for Ln. 1507-KO and
US$25.0 million (43% of the total) for Ln. 1749-KO.  This is in sharp contrast
to outstanding in amortization schedules (stipulated in Loan Agreements) of
US$43.3 million (79% of the total) and US$52.0 million (86.7% of the total),
respectively.  This indicates that repayment periods of the two loans were
significantly shortened due to the prepayment and to a back to back repayment
schedule of each subproject, decreasing the advantage of long-term loans
associated with Bank's financing.
4.09      Economic Perform&nce.  Annexes 6 and 7 present details of economic
performance of subprojects under the two loans. The overall outcome was
satisfactory. The contribution of SMIs to Korea's exports has been signifi-
cant with an average of 21% of industrial exports originating in the SMI
sector during 1982-83.  Under Ln. 1507-KO  exports of W 10.4 billion (19% of
9/   Due to the difficulty to trace all the track records of 550 subprojects,.
a sample of 29 under Ln. 1507-KO and 30 under Ln 1749-KO, representing
various subsectors and regions, were chosen to examine the performance of
the project.

total sales) were realized by sample subprojects in the second year of
operation. The equivalent figure for Ln. 1749-KO was W 5.2 billion, also
accounting for 19X of total sales. These actual results of sample subprojects
were almost identical with projections, which were W 10.5 billion for
Ln. 1507-KO and W 5.8 billion for Ln. 1749-KO.  Both loans contributed to
improvement in productivity and maintaining international competitiveness of
the SMI sector. Estimated total incremental employment totaled 5,175 for Ln.
1507-KO and 5,138 for Ln. 1749-KO, but fell short of projections by 12X and
20%, respectively. The average investment cost per job under Ln. 1507-KO was
US$19,624, compared to the projected figure of US$17,545. The cost for Ln.
1749-KO was US$19,443, 15% higher than the original projection.  Both FRR and
ERR calculated for a sample of 15 projects under two loans are satisfactory.
The FRRs ranged from 19% to 392 and 10 projects remained within 102 of the
estimated FRRs. The ERRs showed a wider range from 202 to 542 and only 5
projects remained within 102 of the estimated ERRs. The four subprojects with
projected ERRs over 602 proved too ambitious s the actuals were between 242
and 482.
V. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
Management, Organization and Staffing
5.01      The SMIB Act provides for a dual Board structure.  The Board of
Policy deals with overall policy matters and comprises seven members including
SMIB's President (acting as Chairman); one representative each from MOP,
Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), BOK, Korea Federation of Small Business
(KFSB) and two members representing SMI entrepreneurs who are selected by
MOF. The Board of Directors which used to be an executing body of management
for daily operations, totally changed its function in April 1984 while the
Board of Policy retains the same function. It now has overall decision-making
authority on important matters related to SMIB's operation and management
which include operational objectives, budget, funding and operational plans,
disposition of retained earnings, etc. It has ten members including SMIB's
President and nine non-standing members comprising a Chairman of the Board of
Directors, vacant as of July 1985, and eight directors. The Chairman and
SMIB's President are appointed by the President of the Republic of Korea. In
connection with this change, former directors were renamed as Senior Vice
Presidents. SMIB has as Executive Officers, one Deputy President and five
Senior Vice Presidents, who are appointed by the President of SMIB out of SMIB
staff. Before this change, the dual board structure performed adequately,
allowing SMIB's management sufficient operational autonomy. As for the new
structure, it is too premature to draw a conclusion.
5.02      SMIB has 21 departments in its headquarters in Seoul, 173
branches/sub-branches distributed throughout the country and three representa-
tive offices located abroad. SMIB has aggressively expanded its branch/sub-
branch network from 116 in 1980 to 173 in 1984. Total staffing increased from
3,535 in 1980 to 7,325 in 1984. At end-1984, its staff strength included
1,611 professionals (22% of total). Administrative expenses in the period
1980 to 1984 have remained at about 32 of average total assets, the same level

as expected at appraisal, indicating that SMIS's expansion during this period
was carefully planned and efficiently executed. SMIB is a well-managed
institution.

5.03      Project Appraisal.  SMIB's appraisal capability was satisfactory at
the time of the first Bank loan and this standard was maintained. Loan appli-
cations are processed by the branch office with assistance when necessary from
the head office's Extension Services Department for technical aspects and the
Credit Analysis Department for credit checks. Working capital loans take into
account an elaborate point scoring system which emphasizes the borrower's
credit rating and collateral. Local currency equipment loans require more
detailed evaluation and basically are approved on the same basis. Foreign
currency equipment loans require much more rigorous analysis with FRR and ERR
calculations required for all "A" subprojects. Both the coverage and quality
of appraisal are sufficient. For free-limit subprojects, SMIB submits t. the
Bank a simplified "Project Summary" giving only the essential financial und
economic project data as agreed during appraisal of Ln. 1507-K0. In general,
SMIB's selection of subprojects has been satisfactory; there were 13 rejec-
tions under Ln. 1507-K0 and 35 under Ln. 1749-K0.  The prudent selection of
subprojects together with relatively high growth in the economy have been
responsible for good repayment performance under both loans. In 1977, SMIS
transferred appraisal and supervision operations for its foreign loans to its
branch offices, and set a free limit for general managers' approval of
US$100,000. The limit was revised to US$200,000 in 1982, and again to
US$300,000 in 1984 in parallel with the upward revision of domestic currency
term loans. The sanction expedited the loan processing period, almost halving
the time between receipt of a subproject application to the opening of a
letter of credit. The training program on appraisal and supervision techni-
ques, which started in 1977 continues on a semi-annual basis. The text covers
broad aspects of loan processing.
5.04      Project Supervision.  During implementation of projects under Loans
1507-K0 and 1749-K0, SMIB continued to follow supervision procedures which
were considered satisfactory under the first projects. All loans are super-
vised by the staff of the branch office involved, with assistance when
required by the head office. Projects are visited at least once a year for
normal projects and as often as necessary for problem projects. Projects
requiring technical input are referred to SMIB's own Extension Services
Department or to Small and Medium Industry Promotion Corporation (SMIPC).
Projects encountering financial or operational difficulties are closely
monitored by the responsible branch office. SMIB branch managers have
received training in basic managerial and financial problem solving. Project
supervision is also assisted by SKIB's Applied Research Department (expanded
as a result of Ln. 2004-K0, SMIB Iv) which periodically prepares and circu-
lates bulletins/papers on practical solutions of common SMI problems.
5.05      Procurement.  SMIB's procurement procedures conform to government
guidelines and to the special requirements of small firms; these procedures
were considered quite adequate to meet the Bank's requirements under its Loans
1507 and 1749-K0. Procurement is normally based on limited competitive bid-



- 10 -
ding procedures with more than two competitive quotations from potential
suppliers. Bid evaluation for foreign currency loans is done by staff of the
Foreign Loan Department. SMIB's procurement procedures were further streng-
thened as a result of measures implemented under Ln. 2004-KO. SMIB's control
over disbursement is satisfactory and ensures that funds are disbursed for
approved purposes.
VI. OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 12/
Operational Performance
6.01      SMIB offers a wide variety of services including equipment loans,
working capital loans, guarantees, checking accounts, overdrafts and extension
services.
6.02      Equipment Loan Operations.  SMIB's equipment loans may be in either
local or foreign currency. Local currency loan approvals showed substantial
growth (a nominal 36%) during 1980-84 (Annex 11). On a yearly basis, actual
equipment loan approvals have invariably exceeded projections done at the time
of appraisal of both Lns. 1507 and 1749-KO. In a sharp contrast however,
foreign -urrency equipment loans have fallen consistently behind the appraisal
estimate , and their annual volume has also fluctuated. The most notable year
was 198' when total foreign currency equipment loan approvals declined to W 28
b-illion   -m W 40 billion in 1983.  This decline can be attributed to the
setting uis if the Small and Medium Industries Promotion Fund which provides
local curr aicy denominated loans for financing of both domestic and imported
equipment and also the fact that more locally manufactured equipment is being
substituted for imported. Of the total loan portfolio outstanding, foreign
currency equipment loans accounted for 17% in 1980 but only 6% in 1984, while
the projection under Ln. 2004 for 1984 expected 10%. Local currency equipment
loans increased from 16% in 1980 to 25X in 1984, which was projected to be
152.
6.03      Working Capital Loan Operations.  Working capital loans have grown
by 24% (nominal) since 1980 in tetrms of outstanding. This growth was much
faster than projected under Loans 1507 and 1749-KO. However, 1984 was excep-
tional in that the actual net increase in working capital loans was less than
the appraisal expectations. Portfolio turnover rate of these loans has
averaged about seven weeks during the past five years.
6.04      Guarantee Operations.  SMIB issues guarantees (almost all short-
term, averaging less than 90 days) against trade documents, payments of import
duties etc. Outstanding guarantees as of year-end 1984 totaled W 158.8 bil-
lion, of which 9Z were in foreign currency. The total is almost four times as
10/ Since projections under Ln 1749-KO covered only up to 1982, projections
under Ln. 2004-KO were used for 1983-84 period to cover the recent five
year period.



- 11 -
much as the projection under Ln 2004-KO. Long-term guarantees are issued,
mainly in foreign currency, to other financial institutions lending to clients
of SMIB whose collateral is already pledged to SMIB.
6.05      Investment Operations.  SMIB invests in government securities, bonds
and debentures, and makes equity investment in SMI companies. For the past
five years, Government securities have accounted for approximately 75-80X of
investments and are typically three to five year National Investment Bonds
redeemable at face value yielding approximately 10% per year. SMI debentures
and bonds are also medium term (2-3 years) instruments yielding 10-14% per
year. As of end-1984 the outstanding balance of SMIB investments in equity or
shares of SMI companies amounted to W 1,710 million or 18Z of total
investment.
6.06      Extension Services  SMIB's extension services, which started shortly
after its establishment, continue to provide appropriate solutions to manage-
rial and technological problems faced by SMI clients. In-plant consultant
services on a no-cost basis were requested by only 46 clients in 1979 but the
number of such requests has since steadily increased and amounted to about
150 firms in 1984, the same as in 1977/78. The Extension Service Department
which has a professional staff of 36 (as of end-1984) also conducts seminars
for SMI executives, assists when necessary in assessing technology require-
ments for loan appraisals, and issues selected studies on SMI topics through a
technical newsletter. Previously, the Extension Department handled foreign
currency loan bid evaluations but in 1983 this responsibility was transferred
to the Foreign Loan Department. Considering that SMIPC's extension services
are available on a referral basis, SMIB's extension services are adequate. On
the whole SMIB's Extension Services Department's performance was consistent
with the expectations at the time of appraisals.
Financial Performance
6.07      Financial Position.  A comparison of SMIB's financial statements and
ratios for 1980-84 with those forecast at appraisal of Lns. 1507, 1749 and
2004-KO is given in Annex 11. As of December 31, 1984 total assets amounted
to U 3,431 billion (US$4.1 billion) showing a growth of 25% per annum since
1980. The total assets were 8% less than the projection under Ln 2004-KO.
SMIB's long-term portfolio has averaged approximately 27X of total assets
during 1980-84. Of SKIS's total assets at end-1984, 67% were financed by
current liabilities (43X by sbort-term deposits), 26% by long-term liabili-
ties, and 7% by equity. BOK borrowing increased from 7% of total assets in
1980 to 14% in 1984. As of year end 1984 SMIB's paid-in capital amounted to
W 157 billion as compared to W 57 billion at year end 1980. Reserve and
retained earnings also increased substantially from W 17 billion to W 70 bil-
lion for the period. Reflecting these improvements, SMIB's long-term debt to
equity ratio has declined from 4.8:1 in 1980 to 3.7:1 in 1984, well below the
covenanted ratio of 10:1. SMIB's total debt to equity ratio has also declined
from 18:1 in 1980 to 15:1 in 1984. The current ratio has varied between 0.9
and 1.1 during the five year period ending 1984; however, SMIB is in no danger
of illiquidity as it has good access to BOK resources. The financial position
of SMIB is satisfactory.



- 12 -
6.08      Financial Performance.  SMIB's projected and audited income state-
ments for 1980-84 are given in Annex 12.  For the period 1982-84 SMIB's level
of income and profits was substantially lower than forecast.  SMIB's gross
spread declined from 5.1 in 1980 to 3.1 in 1982 and 1983, when it suffered
losses. This resulted from Government's decision in June 1982, to reduce
interest rate ceilings on loans from 14Z to 10 and on deposits fr#j 121 to
8Z. The new loan interest rate was mandatorily applied on all outstanding
loans, but the new interest rate was applicable only on new deposits. Since a
large proportion of deposits had longer term maturities extending up to 5
years, there was a considerable imbalance in the structure of SMIB's interest
on lending and borrowing. A new and higher interest rate structure was intro-
duced by the Government in 1984 which along with repayments of older and
higher cost deposits increased SMIB's gross spread in that year to 3.61 and
enabled it to make a profit of W 5.5 billion. Barring any further sudden dis-
tortion in interest rate structure, SMIB's profitability is expected to remain
satisfactory in future years.
6.09      Portfolio Quality.  Considering that SMIB serves the relatively high
risk SMI sector and its portfolio consists of over 50,000 clients with about
160,000 loan accounts outstanding, its portfolio is in an extremely good
conditon (Annex 13). As of end 1984, 1,629 clients were in arrears with
overdue payments of principal and interest totalling W 64 billion or 2.71 of
total loan portfolio; 591 of that amount had been arrears less than three
months and only 61 for more than a year. Total outstanding principal affected
by arrears accounted for 2.91 of total outstanding loans as of end 1984 and is
below the targeted rate of 3.01 to be achieved through an arrears reduction
program agreed with the Bank in 1985. By loan category the same ratio has not
varied significantly: 2.81 for foreign currency loans; 2.91 for working
capital loans; and 3.01 for domestic currency equipment loans. SMIB's loan
collection performance has usually been good with collection rates of 93.81
for local equipment loans in 1984, 95.41 for foreign currency equipment loans
and 99.6% for working capital loans (Annex 14).
6.10      Provisions.  Under the SMIB Act, 251 of net income is to be set
aside as an equity reserve covering possible loan losses. As of end 1984,
reserves and retained earnings reached W 70 billion. In addition, provisions
for doubtful accounts are set aside. In 1980 this was adjusted upward from a
0.031 to 0.71 in view of the adoption of new policy to: (a) increase the
lending ratio to the appraisal value of collateral; and (b) increase lending
to extremely small enterprises without collateral. However, as the actual
write-off rates during 1980-82 were 0.012X on average, SMIB reduced the ratio
to 0.21 in 1983. The ratio is satisfactory in the light of this low arrears
ratio.
6.11      Audit.  SMIB's accounts have been audited since 1977 by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank; their reports have been unqualified. Long
form audit reports were received by the Bank within the specified period of
five months.



- 13 -
Resource Mobilization
6.12      SMIB's efficiency in resource mobilization has been satisfactory
over the period 1980-84 with total resources (domestic and foreign) increasing
at an average rate of 26% per year, allowing the loan portfolio to grow at
approximately the same rate of 24Z (Annex 15). Domestic resources have grown
at a much higher rate (292) than foreign resources (112) and thus the mix of
domestic to foreign resources has gradually shifted from 78:22 to in 1980 to
87:13 in 1984, supporting a higher local currency content in SMIB's portfo-
lio. The share of long-term resources in total domestic currency resources
has remained stable at about 292 over the period 1980-84, reflecting the high
proportion of short-term deposits in SMIB's total resources. This has
constrained SMIB's ability to supply larger amounts of long-term equipment
loans.
6.13      Domestic Currency Resources.  SMIB has become increasingly dependent
on the Government for a large part of its domestic currency resources. During
1980-84, SMIB's long-term and short-term borrowings from various government
funds such as the National Investment Fund (NIF) and BOK grew from 15% to 261
of SMIB's local currency resources. This represents an annual average growth
of 661. Long-term deposits grew at only 19% p.a. during 1980-84, and short-
term deposits by 232 p.a., while borrowing from BOK showed a 412 annual
average growth. However, in an effort to be independent from Government
resources, SMIB has also raised about W 212 billion in the years 1982-84
through the issuance of both long-term and short-term debentures with an
average interest rate of 122 p.a.
6.14      Foreign Currency Resources.  Between 1965 and 1984 SMIB had
mobilized a total of approximately US$607 million in foreign currency
resources. ADB (US$215 million) and the Bank (US$234 million) have supplied
about 742 of these resources while the Korea Foreign Exchange (KFX) scheme was
the next largest source supplying US$75 million or approximately 12Z of the
total. The KFX scheme, which was funded during 1976-80 with the foreign
exchange reserves of the 80K, is no longer active. In recent years (1980-84)
SMIB has received more than 892 of its foreign exchange resources from ADB
(US$90 million) and from the Bank (US$89 million). The balance was provided
by KFW and from Yen-denominated ADB cofinancing.
Vil. CONCLUSIONS
7.01      Following up on Bank's first loan to SMIB, the two Loans (1507 and
1749-KO) under review aimed: (a) to provide foreign currency resources, which
were largely unavailable to SMIs due to a directed credit system, with an
emphasis on reaching smaller enterprises and labor-intensive projects; (b) to
contribute to the institution building process; and (c) to support govern-
mental priorities outlined by SMIB's Development Strategy. These objectives
have been achieved satisfactorily.  The provision of funds to the SMI sector
to finance imported equipment had the intended results. A total of 550
projects with a total cost of W 119.4 billion (US$201.1 million) were financed
under the two loans (para. 4.04) and about 10,300 new jobs were created as a



- 14 -
result of the two loans (para. 4.09). Financial results of subprojects have
been adequate and the portfolio has remained relatively trouble-free. A
component included under each project to reach smaller enterprises and labor-
intensive projects elicited a greater response than expected( para. 4.07), and
total lending for the purpose under each loan surpassed the targeted amounts.
7.02      Since SMIS was already a well-managed organization at the time of
the first Bank loan, its involvement with the Bank resulted in some modest
further institution building. As under the first project, SMIB continued to
follow satisfactory operational procedures. These procedures have been
strengthened by a systematic training system under the two projects under
review. SMIB's branch network expansion has been carefully planned and it has
maintained the quality of its management and staff despite its considerable
growth over the past several years. SMIB has generally maintained satis-
factcry financial performance and position (paras. 6.07 and 6.08). SMIB's
portfolio is in a satisfactory condition; adequate provisions for possible bad
debts have been maintained. It has been in compliance with the long term
debt/equity ratio of 10:1, covenanted under the Loan Agreement, having
received additional contributions from the Government as needed.
7.03      The major governmental priority outlined in SMIB's Development
Strategy was to disperse industries from the Seoul and Busan areas
(para. 4.06). Toward this objective, project subloans to Seoul and Busan were
limited to 50% under Ln. 1507-KO and 45% under Ln. 1749-KO. Actual figures
were 48% and 33X, respectively, and well within the target.
7.04      From the review of Lns 1507-KO and 1749-KO following lessons
emerged:
(a) although the objectives of the two loans were fully achieved, with
hindsight the Bank could have been more active in supporting the
institution building of SMIB. For example, the study on the future
of SMIS, which is to be implemented under the SMI loan (Ln. 2515-K0)
could have been incorporated under the two earlier loans, In
addition, some measures to reduce SMIBs substantial reliance on the
Government for term resources, could have encouraged SMIB to move
towards self reliance for cerm resources (for example, commercial
borrowing and other longer term financial instruments);
(b) despite the fact that the overall performance of the subprojects
were satisfactory, the ex-post ERRS of a number of subprojects fell
below SMIB's estimates (para. 4.09). It is an indication of SKIB's
economic appraisal, generally, being optimistic. The Sank could
have focussed its attention on making suggestions for improving this
aspect. Furtunately, however, this optimism in economic evaluation
has not resulted in the financing of any unviable projects;
(c) sixty-nine subborrowers (out of 550) opted to prepay the entire Bank
subloans (para. 4.08). This was prompted by subborrowers' percep-
tion of continued decline in the value of the Won vis-a-vis the US
dollar and their reluctance to carry the exchange risk on their
subloans. In other words, the effective carrying cost of Sank funds



- 15 -
to the end users far exceeded the cost of domestic currency funds
used to repay the Bank subloans; invariably the tomestic funds
carried interest rates lower than the free market rates. In recent
years this issue has become quite serious and has adversely affected
the rate of utilization of Bank loans for SMI enterprises.
Considering that there is a role for the Bank to play, both in the
SMI subsector and institution building of SMIB and CNB, a workable
mechanism should be developed so as to eliminate the bias against
foreign exchange loans; and
(d) besides its sound appraisal quality, the success of SMIB in
developing and financing SMI enterprises is, to a large extent, a
function of (a) its large branch network (173 branches in 1984), and
(b) its commercial banking activities including deposit taking and
working capital loans which enable SMIB to maintain a constant close
contact with its borrowers. This provides in most cases an early
warning of potential operational and debc service problems. This
institutional model could be reflected by the Sank in its SMI
operations in other countries.

/a   Since 110 subprojects out of 231 for Loan 1507-K0 and 102 subprojects out
of 319 for Loan 1749-KO were already repaid as of end-1984, it became
difficult to trace all the subproject data. As an alternative, a Bank
mission in 1984 agreed that SMIB choose about 30 samptl subvroiects for
each loan, representing various industries and locations. The figures
quoted in the parentheses are based on these sample projects. Average
foreign exchange rate applied is W 489.2 per U8$1 for Loan 1507-K0 and
W 700 per US$1 for Loan 1749-KO.
/b   For 11 subprojects, of wiich actual cost data were not available,
estimated cost of US$7.9 million was used.
/c   Estimates based on the relationship between projected and actual figures
of a sample of subprojects.
/d   For 8 subprojects, of which actual cost data were not available,
estimated cost of US$1.4 million was used.
