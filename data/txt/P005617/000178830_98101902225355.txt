INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
COMPAGNIE DES PHOSPHATES ET DU CIEMIN DE FER DE GAFSA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR THE GAFSA PHOSPHATE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Compagnie des Phosphates et du Chemin de Fer de Gafsa (GAFSA) with the
guarantee of the Republic of Tunisia for the equivalent of US$23.3 million
to help finance a project for phosphate development. The loan would have
a term of 15 years, including 3 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent
per annum. The Government of Tunisia would charge a guarantee fee of 1-3/4
percent per annum on the outstanding amount of the Bank loan, bringing the
cost of the loan to GAFSA to 9 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Tunisia" (EMA-51a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on August 14,
1972. A basic economic mission visited Tunisia in February and March 1973
and is now finalizing its report following discussions with the Government.
The main conclusions of this report are reflected below. Country data sheets
are attached (Annex I).
3.        Tunisia's development has been hampered by scarcity of natural re-
sources including water. Much of the country is arid or semi-arid, and agri-
culture is highly dependent on rainfall. Minerals are mostly of low quality
and, apart from phosphates, limited in quantity. In the mid-1960's, petro-
leum was discovered and has since become an increasingly valuable source of
revenue and export earnings. Industrial development has been handicapped by
the small size of the domestic market, as well as a lack of skills and expe-
rience. Tourism has developed rapidly and workers' remittances have become
a significant item in the balance of payments. Per capita income increased
by 4.4 percent annually between 1961 and 1972 to reach a level of $379.
Tunisia has enjoyed a large amount of external aid and has used this to ex-
pand economic and social infrastructure, broaden the industrial base, increase
the rate of growth, and make available a wide range of social and welfare serv-
ices to a large part of the population. Like most developing countries, how-
ever, it has not yet found a way to eliminate unemployment and poverty and to
achieve a balanced distribution of consumption among income groups, between
urban and rural areas, and among regions.
4.        Government strategy in the 1960's relied heavily on central planning
of investment and resource allocation, with the public sector playing a major
role in production as well as providing infrastructure and services. Foreign



- 2 -
exchange shortages and preoccupation with restraint of inflation led to re-
course to a pervasive system of official price determination and administra-
tive controls. An unusually long series of poor crop years due to shortage
of rainfall slowed down growth of output. Many of the investments in public
enterprises proved to be uneconomic and private initiative in most sectors
except tourism and petroleum was weak. Growth was relatively slow until 1969,
but was combined with the development of infrastructure and a high degree of
domestic price stability.
5.        The Government's present development strategy was introduced after
1969 and forms the basis of the current Fourth Plan, 1973-1976. The principal
objectives are (a) accelerating growth based on export-oriented industries,
mainly by encouraging private initiative, reducing direct Government involve-
ment in production and relaxing administrative regulations; (b) easing the
country's unemployment problem by creating new jobs primarily in the expanding
industrial sector, but also by encouraging worker emigration, reducing popula-
tion growth and improving education and training; and (c) maintaining internal
and external financial stability. The target rate of GDP growth is 7.1 percent,
providing for a 5.4 percent growth rate in per capita private consumption. In-
vestment is projected to increase by 70 percent above Third Plan levels. Na-
tional savings are to finance three-quarters of investment. Exports of goods
and services are projected to grow at 8.8 percent per year at constant prices
and imports at 12.2 percent. An increase in net external capital flows of
almost 100 percent over 1969-1972 average levels would be required, with ex-
ternal capital providing 23.5 percent of total investment; the debt service
ratio would be held to below 20 percent. The Plan targets may be conservative
in terms of both growth and savings potential, and are affected significantly
by the impact of the changed petroleum and phosphates situations on the
Tunisian economy (paragraphs 7 and 8).
6.        The annual growth rate of the gross domestic product over the decade
1961-1970 was 5 percent. A remarkable upsurge has taken place since 1970,
with GDP growing in real terms by 9 percent in 1971, and 18 percent in 1972.
The improvement can be attributed in part to exogenous factors such as good
weather, leading to record cereal crops and a three-fold increase in olive pro-
duction, in part to important growth in several areas (tourism, petroleum and
emigrant workers' remittances) which previous policies had fostered, and in
part to the general reorientation in Government policy since 1969, generating
renewed self-confidence and initiative in the private sector. By 1972, the in-
vestment rate was 23.6 percent of GDP compared to 20.8 percent in 1970; domestic
savings were 21.1 percent of GDP compared to 16.3 percent in 1970, reducing
Tunisia's dependence on external borrowing from 31.6 to 13.6 percent of in-
vestment. The balance of payments has improved steadily since 1967, with the
current account deficit dropping from about D 60 million up to 1967 to D 23
million in 1972. The traditional negative net payments balance was reversed
in 1968, and at the end of 1973 net foreign assets amounted to $256 million,
covering 5.5 months of commodity imports.
7.        Following the very rapid expansion of the economy in 1972, the growth
rate slowed last year to an estimated 2.8 percent. Agricultural output fell



- 3 -
by 11.6 percent from the very high 1972 level, increases in production of
cereals and livestock offsetting only part of the expected drop in olive pro-
duction. Growth may be about 9 percent in 1974. The Government is attempting
to maintain its past success in controlling inflation, though there will be
increased pressures arising from the higher level of investment, the build-up
of foreign exchange reserves and the increased cost of imports. In the medium
terni, and assuming no major recession in developed countries, Tunisia's gain
from the rise in petroleum and phosphate prices should more than offset fore-
seeable adverse external developments on tourism earnings, workers' remit-
tances and other exports due to events abroad. Export earnings from petroleum
are now projected to increase fourfold from $98 million in 1973 to some $368
million in 1976, and phosphate prices have also risen sharply. As a result,
a continued build-up of reserves may be expected over the next several years.
A substantial reduction in the net rate of emigration, originally projected at
20,000 per year, could have serious repercussions on unemployment and income,
particularly in rural areas, unless energetic measures are taken to increase
labor absorption in other sectors.
8.        The increased foreign exchange reserves and Government surplus ex-
pected from higher export prices and consequent tax revenue do not call for
a basic revision in development strategy but suggest that Tunisia could step
up its efforts to achieve higher investment and growth rates and increased
employment, and to depend less on emigration and foreign aid.    The main con-
straints are likely to be the speed at which policies and institutions re-
spond to the challenge and projects are prepared and executed. The new
orientation since 1969 and the improved economic situation provide the Gov-
ernment with an opportunity to step up efforts to achieve its declared social
objectives, including greater impact on employment.
Tunisia has made some impressive social gains.   By 1971, primary
school enrollment had reached 73 percent and secondary enrollment 42 percent
of the relevant age-groups. Public health services have been greatly expanded
with many provided free, a family planning program introduced and social secur-
ity services provided to an increasing proportion of the labor force. Public
social expenditure, both current and capital, has increased at the rate of
9.3 percent per year and accounted for 14.5 percent of GDP in 1970. Nonethe-
less, major social issues remain. Further progress is needed in land reform.
Wide regional and income disparities are persistent and there has been a grow-
ing concentration of productive activities in urban areas. Job creation has
not kept pace with the growth of the labor force, and in 1972 the unemploy-
ment rate was estimated at 14 percent.
10.       Agriculture, the dominant sector in the economy, provides nearly
half of total employment, 30 percent of merchandise exports and 17 percent of
GDP. Food processing industries account for another 5 percent of GDP and over
a third of value added in manufacturing. Agricultural production jumped in
1971 and again in 1972, largely as a result of favorable weather, and the
potential for further growth is clear. While large infrastructure invest-
ments were made during the last decade, current policy emphasizes projects



- 4 -
that make a rapid and direct contribution to production and recognizes var-
ious constraints on agricultural development: absentee ownership and insecur-
ity of tenure, inadequate access to agricultural credit, the need to devote
more resources to extension services and agricultural education, and under-
utiliLation of irrigation investments. D 40 million has been allocated to a
rural development program to be executed by the provincial administrations.
11.       During the 1960's manufacturing production in Tunisia increased by
7 percent annually. There was a remarkable 30 percent further increase in
1972 due in part to a record year for the olive oil processing industry.
The early thrust of industrialization was supplied by large import substitu-
tion projects in the state sector. These suffered, however, from the limited
domestic market and shortages of experienced staff and management. Under the
Fourth Plan, private manufacturing investment, particularly in textiles,
fertilizers and metals transformation, is expected to average D 25 million
per year between 1973 and 1976, compared with D 12 million in 1972, and to
account for two-thirds of total investment in manufacturing. Foreign private
investors have been offered incentives and are expected by Tunisia to contri-
bute through finance, know-how and overseas marketing, in creating competitive
industries producing a wide range of exports. Tunisia's preferential trade
agreement with the EEC, currently being renegotiated, also gives it some ad-
vantages. Preinvestment work, and the preparation of programs for re-equipment
and modernization in priority subsectors have been started. Tunisia aims to
develop petroleum-based industries and production of phosphoric acid and other
phosphate derivatives for export, while possibilities for metal manufacturing
for export are being explored. The Plan further foresees the establishment of
a small-scale industry fund to encourage growth and decentralization of such
industries.
12.       The development of tourism is relatively recent.   Foreign-visitor
arrivals in Tunisia reached 780,000 in 1972, with an annual rate of growth of
30 percent -- higher than any other Mediterranean country. Earnings from
tourism are now a main source of foreign exchange, reaching US$154 million in
1973. The Government actively supports expansion through incentives to
private hotel promoters and has recently embarked on a long-term tourism
infrastructure program.
13.       Since the early 1960's Tunisia has received large amounts of external
capital. Official aid amounted to an average of US$19 per capita per annum,
almost half from the United States, mostly in the form of program loans and
PL 480 commodity aid. Other major lenders were France, the Federal Republic
of Germany, Italy, Kuwait and the Bank Group.   Project loans, particularly for
public enterprises, accounted for 58 percent of total disbursements in 1969-
1972.  Most aid has been obtained on rnclcessionary terms:  from 1969-1972, the
average terms of borrowing from bilateral sources were 2.3 percent interest and
27 years to maturity, including 9 years of grace; from multilateral sources
5.4 percent interest and 28 years to maturity, including 6 years of grace.
For private borrowing (about $40 million annually), average terms were 6.0
percent interest and 9 years to maturity. Direct foreign private investment



- 5 -
in Tunisia has been limited. However, mainly as a result of increasing out-
lays on petroleum exploration and development, it has risen from ar. average
of $19 million per annum in the late 1960's to $40 million in 1972.
14.       Tunis'a's total external public debt was $1,108 million (of which
$693 million were disbursed) at the end of 1972.   Disbursed debt is estimated
to have been $862 million at the end of 1973.   The debt service in 1973 is
estimated to have been 12.7 percent of exports of goods, non-factor services
and workers~ remittances. The ratio is expected to fall significantly by 1976,
folflowing recent petroleum and phosphate price increases.   Government policy
on futujre external borrowing in the light of its new balance of payments po-
sition is still under review. Tunisia is capable of servicing substantial
additional debt on less concessionary terms than it has received in the past.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TUNISIA
15.       Starting in 1962, Tunisia has received a total of eighteen Bank
loans and ten IDA credits amounting respectively to $195.2 million and $65.7
million, net of cancellations and refundings. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of May 317
1974, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
16.       While there have been some problems in project execution, as in the
railways, agricultural credit and family planning projects, on the whole
project implementation has been satisfactory.    Important institutional improve-
ments have been achieved. In both the transport and public utilities sectors,
in lependent agencies have been created or strengthened.   The main Tunisian
development finance company, BDET, has been placed on a sound footing.
17.       In accordance with Tunisian priorities, past Bank Group lending has
emphasized support for long-term investments in infrastructure and social de-
v7elopment. Lending for transport, power and tourism infrastructure, has ac-
counted for 34 percent of Bank/IDA commitments in Tunisia. Lending for urban
and social development, including water suipply, education, family planning and
the Tunis urban planning and public transport project, has recently become the
largest component of Bank lending and accounted for a further 40 percent. In-
dustrial and hotel financing through Banque de Developpement Economique de
Tunisie (BDET, formerly Societe Nationale d'Investissement) comes third with
19 percent. Agriculture and fisheries have received 7 percent of total com-
mitments.
18.       Three more projects, for irrigation rehabilitation in the Medjerda
and Nebhana Valleys, BDET, and urban sewerage, are expected to be presented



-6-
to the Executive Directors this fiscal year. Future lending is expected to
support the Government's policies aiming at rapid growth in a more open,
export-oriented economy, measures to create employment and to achieve a more
equitable income distribution, and institutional reform. The proposed lending
program will emphasize agriculture including rural development. This would
require substantial inputs of -manipower and technical assistance to support
increased production and the creation of new institutions which can reach the
rural poor. Over the next several years, it is expected that a number of
projects will be presented which address the problems of land reform, organiza-
tion for agricultural and rural development, and integration of agricultural
with other aspects of rural development. Urban and social development will
be furthered by a first operation in the sewerage sector involving important
organizational changes, while a third education project would also be presented.
19.       Lending for industry has so far been through the development fi-
nance company, BDET, and has mostly benefited medium-size companies. Such
lending will continue, but at a declining rate as BDET diversifies its sources
of funds. It is expected to be supplemented by direct industrial lending,
first for the proposed phosphate mining project, and later for small-scale
industries and in other priority subsectors, now being studied with Bank
technical assistance, in which Tunisia has a comparative advantage.
20.       The Bank Group accounted for almost 20 percent of disbursements of
official aid to Tunisia between 1969 and 1972 and is expected to maintain its
share, with that of the US declining and that of other, particularly Arab,
sources of funds rising. The Bank Group's shares in total debt outstanding
at the end of 1972 and in debt service during 1972 were 18 percent and 7 per-
cent respectively. Over the rest of the decade, the Bank Group's share in
total external debt is not expected to vary much; its share in debt service
will probably rise to approach the share of debt outstanding.
21.       IFC has invested in a fertilizer plant, in BDET, in COFITOUR (a
company to promote and invest in tourism projects), in RYM (a large hotel
development) and in a promotional company Sousse Nord which is to prepare
plans for an integrated tourism resort development in one of the areas in
which tourism infrastructure is being financed jointly by the Bank, IDA and
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW). IFC's most recent investment, in May
1974, was in Industries Chimiques du Fluor, which will produce aluminum
fluoride from local fluorspar for export. With the inclusion of this in-
vestment IFC's net commnitments in Tunisia total $14.0 million.
PART III - THE PHOSPHATE SECTOR IN TUNISIA
22.       The phosphate sector (mining and processing) had a constant value
of output after 1966, and its share of GDP fell to about 3 percent in 1973.
Tle industry employs 13,000 persons, mostly in the Gafsa area of southern
Tunisia which offers few alternative sources of employment. Export earnings
declined between 1967 and 1973 despite the increase in exports of superphos-
phates and the steady volume of rock exports, as the prices of both phosphate



rock and fertilizers declined by more than 20 percent over this period. As
a result, the contribution of phosphates to total Tunisian export earnings
declined from over 25 percent in the mid-1960s to 16 percent in 1972. This
proportion is, however, expected to increase sharply in 1974 and stay higher
for several years as a result of both a large increase in prices in 1974 over
1973 (para. 26) and a build-up of production and export of rock, acid and
fertilizers, associated in part with the proposed project. Receipts from
exports of processed products exceeded those from rock exports for the first
time in 1972.
23.       Tunisia accounts for about 4 percent of world production of phos-
phate rock with ore which is generally of low to medium quality compared with
that sold by Morocco and other competitors. Output of saleable rock has
fluctuated between 2.6 and 3.4 million tons per annum since 1965. Exports
have remained constant at 2.3 million tons, while consumption of the domestic
processing industry more than doubled, to 1.1 million tons or one-third of
output. Over 90 percent of phosphate rock is produced by the Government-
controlled Compagnie des Phosphates et du Chemin de Fer de Gafsa (GAFSA),
the proposed borrower of the Bank loan (para. 31).
24.       Processing of the sector's output is dominated by the production
for export of phosphoric acid and triple superphosphate from about one-third
of annual phosphate rock output. Four large producers account for nearly all
of Tunisia's phosphoric acid and fertilizer production. The Government and
GAFSA between them hold a controlling interest in each of these companies, in
partnership with various foreign private interests. Total capacity of the
processing plants is 120,000 tons per annum phosphoric acid (as P205), 460,000
tons of triple superphosphate, and 120,000 tons of compound fertilizer. Near-
ly all of this production is exported.
25.       Tunisia's phosphate sector has good potential for future develop-
ment with numerous investment possibilities. The ore reserves presently de-
lineated are sufficient for about 20 years even with major production in-
creases, provided several new mines replace depleted deposits. The Sehib
mine, to be developed under the proposed project, will be the next such new
mine. In addition there are indications of further reserves as large as those
presently known in other parts of the Gafsa area. Over the period 1974 to
1978, investments in mining and beneficiation facilities are expected to be
$122 million (para. 47). Production should increase from the present 3.4
million tons to 4.6 million tons by 1976. Investment in processing may reach
$43 million between 1973 and 1976; one-quarter of this total, however, is for
plants still at relatively early stages of planning. This investment should
double the domestic processing of phosphate rock, to 2.1 million tons or 46
percent of 1976 rock output, with exportable supplies of rock almost unchanged.
Most of the increased acid and fertilizer production would continue to be
for export, with only a small quantity required for the domestic market. The
annual growth in export sales would be between 10 and 15 percent.



-8-
The Market for Tunisian Phosphate Rock
26.       World production of phosphate rock rose from 40 to 90 million tons
between 1960 and 1972, with the US (42 percent), the USSR (22 percent) and
Morocco (16 percent) as leading producers. World export trade increased from
29 to 44 million tons between 1965 and 1972; the main exporters were Morocco
(31 percent), the US (29 percent) and the USSR (14 percent). The world rock
supply/demand situation imoved from a world wide over-supply in the late 1960's
and early 1970's to a serious shortage by late 1973 as a result of increased
worldwide fertilizer demand and supply problems in the U.S. Prices reflected
this development; export prices for the first half of 1974 were three times
higher than those prevailing in 1973 and there was a further rise in July
1974. The sharp increase in prices is also explained by a necessary recovery
following a depressed price situation over most of the last decade. World
rock prices are expected to remain strong through late 1975 because of an
expected continuing tight supply. World rock supply is, however, expected to
improve and balance demand in late 1976. Thereafter a small supply surplus
is expected to persist. Long-term FOB equilibrium prices are therefore fore-
cast to stabilize -- by 1976-77 -- at 20 to 3n percent below January 1974
price levels, and to increase thereafter at a rate close to the prevailing
world inflation rate.
27.       Prices for Tunisian rock tend to follow world trends fairly closely.
Tunisia should be able to maintain its present level of exports without dif-
ficulty in spite of the medium quality of its product. About 40 percent
of exports go to consumers who are considered to constitute a captive market.
Some of these consumers operate plants in Europe designed to accommodate the
specific characteristics of Tunisian rock. In addition there is a large
demand (0.8 million tons in 1972) for Tunisian rock for direct application
because of its softness, reactivity with other soil elements and solubility.
Finally, some traditional markets in South East Asia may be regained if the
Suez Canal is reopened.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
28.       In 1972 the Government requested Bank assistance in rationalizing
the Tunisian phosphate sector and more specifically in the modernization and
expansion of GAFSA's mining operations. Two Bank reports to the Government
and the companv in early and mid-1973 pointed to the need for GAFSA to carry
out further preparatory work on its investment plans, define more clearly
plans for modernizing existing mines, and strengthen management, planning
and financial control. The company took steps to reorganize, established a
planning unit and formulated a modernization program.
29.       A feasibility study of the Sehib project, and preliminary engineer-
ing, were carried out by the consultants Heurtey (France). The project was



- 9 -
ready for appraisal in February-March 1974. Negotiations took place in
Washington in June 1974. The Tunisian delegation comprised Messrs. Amira
(Managing Director), Ben Debba, Beji and Karai (for GAFSA) and Mr. Ennaifer
(for the Government).
30.       A report entitled "Tunisia - Appraisal of the Gafsa Phosphate Proj-
ect" (No. 482-TJN) dated July 12, 1974 is being distributed separately to the
Executive Directors. The appraisal report covers the Sehib project (para. 41),
for which $23.0 million would be provided out of the proposed loan. An addi-
tional sum of $0.3 million is included in the loan for a study of the develop-
ment of the Gafsa region (para. 55) of this Report). A loan and project sum-
mary is attached as Annex III.
The Borrower
31.       The Compagnie des Phosphates et du Chemin de Fer de Gafsa (GAFSA)
was founded in 1887. After Tunisia's independence the Government was invited
to buy participation and by early 1973 held 83 percent of the share capital.
A large number of small holdings account for the remaining shares. After the
Government makes a further equity contribution to GAFSA in 1974 (see para. 35)
its holding will rise to 98 percent.
32.       GAFSA operates four long-established mines and has four other de-
posits in various stages of development, all except one of which are tinder-
ground mines. The extracted phosphate rock is processed in four washing and
three air classification plants to produce 3.3 million tons of saleable product
per annum before being shipped by rail to Sfax (some 230 km away) and to Gabes
(300 km) for export and domestic manufacture of phosphoric acid and fertilizer.
33.       GAFSA employs about 10,000 people.    Efficiency suffers from a lack
of underground face workers and overstaffing in surface jobs, resulting in
low productivity and a high level of absenteeism. Past neglect of training
and safety programs and poor working conditions have been contributory factors.
A manpower study in 1974 has formulated a program for dealing with these
problems and will be implemented in conjunction with the modernization program
for existing mines and plants (para. 39).
34.       Management was poor in the past and was changed too frequently.     Re-
cent steps to reorganize, recruit experienced staff, and review salary policies
have improved the situation. The company is making a determined effort to
improve its managerial effectiveness: cost accounting and inventory control
raave been introduced; the Production Department has been reorganized and the
modernization program formulated by a planning unit established within it.
Better coordination among operating units has been achieved along with higher
motivation and improved productivity and safety consciousness. Training,
budget control, safety and planning have all been improved. However, GAFSA
has still not achieved fully integrated corporate financial planning.     Accord-
ingly, assurances were obtained that GAFSA would consult the Bank annually on
updated 5-year investment programs for all its operations, and submit a plan
of action to improve its corporate and project financial analysis for Bank
review by July 1, 1975 and thereafter implement it (Loan Agreement Section
5.04).

Financial Position of GAFSA
35.       GAFSA's financial record has been poor since 1967. Only in 1972
did riine production surpass 1966 levels. The company's net income dropped
from D 1.7 million in 1966 to a record net loss of nearly D 4 million in 1972.
In 1973 there was some improvement due to an increase in prices and, to a
lesser extent, in production which, however, still resulted in a loss of D 3.7
million. The basic reasons for GAFSA's substantial losses were declining
prices for phosphate rock during the 1960s and early 1970s, and high produc-
tion costs and virtually no cost-saving investments for nearly two decades.
GAFSA's poor position was shown by its lack of working capital (the current
ratio was below 0.7 until 1973) and an unfavorable debt-equity ratio. The
Government has made several capital contributions to the company since 1970
as part of successive financial consolidations. In implementation of the
most recent of these (in 1974) it will make a contribution, already voted by
the shareholders, of D 5 million to GAFSA's equity. The Government will also
convert D 6.5 million in credits to GAFSA into equity. With these contributions,
and after writing off past losses, GAFSA's capital will total D 12.7 million.
36.       For the first time since 1966 GAFSA is expected to realize a posi-
tive net income, amounting to D 34.1 million, in 1974. The main reason is the
large increase in phosphate prices for 1974 over 1973, and to a lesser extent
an increase in production. GAFSA's capital position will also be much improved.
Net income in future years is expected to decline under the impact of the pro-
jected drop in phosphate prices and increasing operating costs. The importance
of the cost-reducing modernization program is shown by the fact that even with
full production from Sehib, the existing mines will contribute 71 percent of
GAFSA's total sales.
37.       GAFSA's annual accounts have been audited by a competent local
auditing firm. Assurances were obtained that the accounts would at all times
be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank (Loan Agreement
Section 5.02).
GAFSA's 1974-1978 Investment Program
38.       GAFSA's investment program during the years 1974 to 1978 is domi-
nated by two large programs and also contains a number of miscellaneous re-
placement investments. At four of its existing mines and the related treatment
plants GAFSA will carry out a modernization program costing an average of $10
million annually (see next section). At the same time the company will proceed
with the exploitation of the Sehib deposit, which is the principal part of the
project for whiclh a Bank loan is proposed (para. 41 et seq.).
The Modernization Prograr
39.       The modernization program was drawn up in 1973 by a newly established
planning unit at the request of the Bank. It aims to improve the efficiency
and safety, lower the costs and increase the productivity of GAFSA's operations
and is essential to strengthen the company against the day when phosphate



- 11 -
prices decline from their current high levels, since GAFSA faces competition
fror lower-cost Moroccan and other producers.    The program will permit an in-
ccrease of about 20 percent in the output from existing mines, to reach a level
of 3.9 million tons of saleable product by 1977. This output should be pro-
duced at costs of operation up to 30 percent lower in the mines and up to 20
percent lower in the treatment plants than at present.
40.       The program involves improvement of working conditions, ventilation
and safety, mechanization of extraction and haulage operations, and expansion
of capacity in the mines; modification and replacement of process equipment
to increase the efficiency and capacity of the washing and air classifying
plants; replacement and upgrading of internal railway transport equipment;
and upgrading of the workshops and materials handling facilities. The gen-
eral nature of the program as defined is technically sound; however, some
work remains to be done to make detailed choices of subprojects. This would
be done by the unit which prepared the program. GAFSA has agreed to strengthen
its staff for planning and implementing the program (Loan Agreement Section
4.02). The modernization program would be updated annually in consultation
with the Bank (Loan Agreement Section 5.04). The Kuwait Fund for Arab Eco-
nomic Development has approved a loan (para. 48) towards the financing of the
program, the rest of which would be financed by GAFSA.
Project Description
41.       The project involves developing the Sehib deposit in southern
Tunisia, near Gafsa, to produce two million tons per annum of phosphate
rock through underground mining by the longwall method (see para. 42 below).
The deposit has sufficient ore reserves to permit twenty years of mining,
The product would be upgraded by washing to produce 1.6 million tons of
marketable product for export. The project includes underground mining and
haulage eauipment, a 6 km conveyor from the mine, a washing plant, water and
power supply, workshops, offices, open and covered storage facilities, service
and repair shops for the maintenance of equipment, housing for supervisory
personnel and some minor roads. Finally, a study of the development of the
Gafsa region would be carried out under the project. In addition, the national
railway company, SNCFT, will provide a 13 km spur line to Sehib, a station and
loading facilities at Sehib, additional rolling stock and some upgrading of
the main line to the port of Sfax to handle GAFSA's increased output.
42.       In the selected longwall mining method a plow, moving along an
armored conveyor, cuts the rock from a face 70 to 100 meters wide in repeated
passes. Hlydraulic-powered props support the roof in the immediate vicinity
of the plow only and advance with it. The cut rock is transported by the face
conveyor to feed into the main mine haulage system. This method achieves high
extraction rates. It would be a marked improvement over existing methods in
GAFSA's mines. Extensive trials at Sehib have demonstrated the technical
viability of the longwall method but also the need for modification of the
equipment to counter roof control problems. A modified system, for which roof
control and production performance guarantees have been given, will be in-
stalled in late 1974. While there is some risk involved in using the long-
wall method, it is considered this has been minimized.

Proj ect Execution
43.       Construction of the Sehib project will be carried out by GAFSA with
the assistance of supervising consultants acceptable to the Bank (Loan Agree-
ment Section 3.02). Heurtey (France) prepared the feasibility study of tile
project and conducted the preliminary engineering. Under a new contract ex-
pected to be signed in July 1974 after consultation with the Bank, Heurtey will
complete the detailed engineering and supervise procurement. They will also
supervise construction and installation of both underground and surface facil-
ities, with assistance from Sofremines (France) for the underground facilities.
44.       Skill levels needed by both underground and maintenance personnel
at Sehib will be considerably higher than in the case of GAFSA's other opera-
tions in view of the more mechanized mining method to be employed. For mining,
on-the-job training has been carried out for the last two years and the men
so trained will help provide on-the-job training for the other miners required.
At least four senior engineers are being hired for the Sehib operations, along
with other more junior staff. To handle the new longwall equipment, nine
underground foremen with specific experience will be required. These foremen
are not available in Tunisia and it is expected they will be recruited under
a contract with the French State Mining Company. GAFSA has agreed to determine
and implement a staffing plan for its Sehib facilities in consultation with
the Bank (Loan Agreement Section 4.01(b)).
45.       Detailed engineering began in July 1974. At the same time Beurtey
began updating the tender documents for international competitive bidding,
which were prepared in 1970 and require only minor modifications. Procurement
of major equipment items should be completed by July 1975. The washing plant
is expected to be commissioned by mid-1977. The development of the mine is
already underway. The first longwall will be installed in early 1975 with
the others starting up from mid-1976 to early 1977.
Project Cost and Financing
46.       The total cost of the Sehib project is estimated at $64.2 million
including interest during construction ($2.5 million). The foreign exchange
component of project cost is estimated at $44.3 million, or 69 percent of the
total cost. The regional development study is expected to cost a further
$0.5 million ($0.3 million in foreign exchange). Equipment estimates are
based on quotations from suppliers received between December 1973 and February
1974 for orders to be placed in late 1974. Civil works estimates are based on
February 1974 inquiries among potential Tunisian contractors. Physical con-
tingencies at a rate of 10 percent have been included. Price contingencies
have been established assuming an increase over past low inflation rates for
local purchases, to 10 percent per annum, and inflation rates of 13 percent
per annum on imported goods and services, after 1974.
47.       The modernization program is estimated to cost $51.3 million over
che five years 1974 to 1978, including interest during construction of $0.9
million, with a foreign exchange cost of $33.5 million. Miscellaneous replace-
ment investments would total $6.4 million to 1978. Total financing needs for

GAFSA's investment program up to 1978 are $121.9 million (D 53.0 mil'lion) and
would be provided as follows:

48.       The proposed Bank loan would provide $23.0 million toward the
finance needed for the Sehib project. The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic De-
velormeiut has approved a loan to Tunisia of 2 million Kuwaiti dinars (equiva-
lent to 86.9 million) for the modernization program. It would be repaid in
15 years including 3 years of grace, with interest at 4 percent per annum.
This money would be relent to GAFSA for 12 years including 2 years of grace,
with interest at 8 percent per annum. The Government would (para. 35) make
a D 5 million ($11.5 million) equity contribution to GAFSA. Over the period
i974-19 78, GAFSA is expected to contribute D 35 million ($80.5 million) or
66 percent of the finance required for its investment program. This relatively
hi-h proportion is made possible by GAFSA's expected large receipts. There is
a comfortable safety factor in the projection of revenues as against financing
needs, and the sales projections are themselves based on relatively conservative
price assumptions (para. 26).   The Government has guaranteed to ensure that
CAFSA has sufficient funds to complete both the Sehib project and the moderni-
zation program (Guarantee Agreement Section 2.02).
Ki.     rTo maintain GAFSA's sound financial structure, agreement was reached
that the company would at all times maintain a debt-equity ratio not exceeding
55:45 and a zurrent ratio of not less than 1.3:1. GAFSA also agreed not to
dIstribute dividends, other than a 5 percent annual dividend provided fcr by
its statutes, unless full provision has first been made for the investment
needs of both Sehib and the modernization program in addition to meeting the
current ratio test. Finally, GAFSA agreed to consult the Bank before making
investments in any year exceeding $5 million (other than for Sehib, the moderni-
zatioio program and normal renewals), until the Sehib project and the moderniza-
tion prcgram have been completed; and exceeding $15 million thereafter (Loan
Agreement Sections 5.05, 5.06, 5.09 and 5.10).
Procuremrent and Disbursement
5R).      All equipment and machinery--independent of whether or not financed
by rhe Ban1k--will- be procured through international competitive tender follow-
Ing Bank guidelines.  Domestic suppliers will be given a preference of 15
percent or the applicable customs duty, whichever is the lower, in bid evalua-
tion, Aln exception is the longwall face equipment and the drifting equipment,
which hew,!ever will rot be financed by the Bank.  Because of the sDecial nature
of the lon,wall equipment and the need to standardize and adapt it to Sehib's



- 14 -
specific mine conditions, it will be purchased from Westfalia (Germany)-the
manufacturer supplying identical equipment for the trial phase. The drifting
equipment will be supplied by Austria for purposes of standardization. All
civil works (none of which would be financed by the Bank) will be carried out
by T,nisian contractors selected after local advertising and competitive bidding.
51.       The Bank loan would be disbursed over the three years 1975 to 1977.
Disbursements for the Sehib project would be made against the c.i.f. cost of
an agreed list of eligible equipment and spare parts, all of which is expected
to be imported.
Public Infrastructure Requirements
52.       GAFSA would install and finance the transmission line and transfor-
mer capacitv needed for the Sehib project and purchase power from the public
power company, STEG. For the Sehib plant's water requirements (for which
GAFSA would install and finance the necessary facilities), the Government has
agreed to provide GAFSA with a concession for exclusive use of a suitable
water source not later than July 1, 1975 (Guarantee Agreement Section 2.04(b)).
Railway facilities required to handle the increased output from both Sehib and
the existing mines would be provided by the national railway company, SNCF'T.
The African Development BBank has approved a loan of $4 million equivalent to
finance wagons. The sane bank has agreed in principle to finance the track
improvements and construction needed. The Government has agreed to ensure the
availability of sufficient funds to SNCFT to complete the railway works, and
to cause SNCFT to carry out the works in accordance with a timetable to be
agreed with the Bank by December 31, 1974 (Guarantee Agreement Sections 2.01
(b) and 2.02).
Employment Effects
53.       The region around GAFSA in Southern Tunisia is heavily dependent
or mining employment, with little alternative employment in agricultural ac-
tivities in and around the desert oases. The Sehib project will create em-
ployment for 660 people at full production, with vastly improved working and
safety conditions and much higher skill levels than in existing mines. The
modernization program will significantly improve working and safety conditions
at the existing mines and plants; at the same time, however, the introduction
of partially mechanized methods of mining will necessitate reducing the labor
force. The net effect over the period 1974 to 1979 will be to reduce the total
company labor force by 860 people. The reduction will be effected gradually
over the whole period by a combination of natural attrition, early retirement,
retraining for employment in GAFSA's programs of general services and housing,
and retention of some temporarily-employed personnel, until the opening of the
Kef Eschfair mine at the end of the period offers some additional jobs.
54.       GAFSA has agreed to consult the Bank annually on, and implement an
updated manpower reduction program, as well as programs for training and the
expansion of social and health facilities for its labor force (Loan Agreement
Section 4.03).



- 15 -
Regional Development Study
55.       In the longer term it seems unlikely GAFSA will be able to offer
significant increases in employment to new job-seekers. Accordingly the
Government has requested Bank financing of a study of alternative development
possibilities in the region to be carried out by December 31, 1975 under the
auspices of a regional planning institute it proposes to create in the near
future. GAFSA would relend $0.3 million of the Bank loan to the Government
on the original terms to help finance the execution of the study. The terms
of reference and arrangements for carrying out the study would be determined
in agreement with the Bank (Loan Agreement Section 3.06; Guarantee Agreement
Section 3.03). It is expected the study would consider possibilities for live-
stock development, artisan activities, urban infrastructure needs, the input
from a master plan for water resource development in the South currently under-
way with Libyan financing, and opportunities for expanding and diversifying
cultivation around the oases.
Project Justification
56.       The Sehib project will produce for export.   Net export earnings
at full production after 1980 will be $39-43 million per annum. The economic
rate of return is little different from the financial rate of return, which
is 30 percent. Even with a 20 percent increase in capital and operating
costs and a six-month delay in project start-up the return declines only
to 16 percent. The project would be marginal only in the event of a drop
in phosphate prices in real terms of about 40 percent below January 1974
prices, an eventuality judged unlikely. However, it cannot be completely
ruled out, even though such a price would be equivalent to a decline in
real terms to a level about 15 percent below the levels of the late 1960s,
which did not give the world phosphate industry a sufficient return to expand
capacity in line with demand. Nevertheless, the Sehib project and moderniza-
tion program are high priority investments, and the financial risk is accept-
able.
57.       The use of a capital-intensive technique (the longwall method of
mining) at Sehib is justified by the great increase in productivity which it
can achieve. It should help to overcome GAFSA's problem of securing suffi-
cient numbers of face workers and improve the working conditions and health
of the miners. At the same time the employment Sehib will provide (660 jobs)
will absorb some workers freed by the modernization program. This program
is necessary both for the long-term financial health of GAFSA, a high-cost
producer, and to improve conditions for the work-force at existing mines.
Only limited mechanization is being introduced under the modernization pro-
gram. The employment reduction will be effected by measures (para. 53) which
will reduce or eliminate hardship.
58.       The regional development study is expected to result in the iden-
tification of projects to develop infrastructure, agriculture, small industries
and tourism in the Gafsa area and provide significant employment opportunities
for future job seekers.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Cr. 94: Second Education Project; US$13 million credit of September 16, 1966;
Closing Date:  (original) December 31, 1970; (current) December 31. 1974.
Physical execution of the project is almost completed. All project
schools have been accepted by the government from the contractors, virtually
all equipment and furniture have been purchased, and most of it has been de-
livered and installed. Despite early delays in the appointment of UNESCO ex-
perts and their counterparts in the Educational Planning Unit, an interim re-
port, including a diagnosis of primary and general secondary education and a
preliminary analysis of higher education, has been prepared. However, the
report does not cover vocational and technical training, education finances
and management, and administration of the education system. To allow for the
utilization of savings and the completion of the technical assistance program,
a further extension of the present Closing Date is likely to be required.
Ln. 573: Port Development Prolect; US$8.5 million loan of November 29, 1968;
Closing Date: (original) December 31, 1972; (current) December 31, 1974.
Project works have been completed at a total cost slightly above ap-
praisal estimates, due mainly to unexpected price increases and unforeseen soil
conditions, which delayed construction. Savings in foreign exchange of about
$0.2 million are being used to finance a ports master plan study whose execu-
tion has begun. The Closing Date has been extended to permit completion of
the study.
Ln. 581: First Water Supply Project; US$15 million loan of January 16, 1968;
Closing Date:  (original) December 31,'1973; (current) December 31, 1974.
Cr. 209:  Second Water Supply Project; US$10.5 million credit of June 30, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974.
Because of problems with locally manufactured asbestos-cement pipe
completion of the First Project was delayed and the Closing Date of the Loan
was extended. It now appears possible that constraints resulting from lack
of capacity in the local construction industry may make it necessary to set
back the Closing Date by a further six months. Final project costs are ex-
pected to be about 6% below appraisal estimates (but 7% higher in dollar terms
because of devaluation). The Second Project is 12 to 18 months behind sche-
dule for the same reasons as well as because of initial delays in final design.
Final costs may be about 5% higher than original estimates because of current
inflation rates, but they will be 20%-25% higher in dollar terms. Because of
delays in execution the Closing Date will have to be extended.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. 606:  Railways Project; US$8.5 million loan and US$3.5 million credit,
Cr. 150:  both of June 4, 1969; Closing Date of loan:    (original) December 31,
1973; (current) December 31, 1975.
The project has been delayed both by floods (one year) and by finan-
cial difficulties (one year). It is now expected to be substantially completed
by December 31, 1974. The financial problems were caused bv non-payment of
freight charges bv the railway's largest customer, the state-controlled Gafsa
Pihosphate Company; operational deficits, due to low rates and fares; and higher
than estimated prices of rolling stock.   Goverinment hias undertaken to reimburse
railwav losses for 1972 and 1973. A new cost-based tariff was introduced on
January 1, 1974; traffic and operating results, hovever, have not improved as
expected, and continuing Government contributions to the railways and further
tariff increases will be required. A reallocation of the proceeds of the loan
and credit permitted the placing of all outstanding orders; cost increases of
about $6 million for items in the original list of goods are being financed by
utilizing a Spanish line of credit.   The credit has been fully disbursed; the
Closing Date of the loan lhas been extended to permit completion of project
execution.
Cr. 238: Population Project; US$4.8 million credit of April 5, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
After a slow start, resulting in a 24-monthi delay, there has been
soine progress in recent months, but several problems remain. A new Director
General has recently been appointed to the National Office for Family Planning
and Population.   Program performance, though showing signs of improving, is
still inadequate. An Association sector report incorporating a Four Year Plan
of Action will shortly be forwarded to the Government.    This, together with
thle appointment of the new Director General, should assist in improving programn
performance.  Tihe Avicenne School is now expected to admit students for thle
fall 1974 session.   A provisional award has been made for construction of the
Tunis maternity hospitals and work is due to start in October.    W-lork on the
Sousse and Sfax maternity hiospitals shou-ld start in November and December
respectively. Construction of a ma-ority of the 29 M1CH centers could start
in October.  one urban maternity hospital and two rural maternity centers may
be eliminated from the project. The total cost of the project after revision
is now estimated at some $14 million, in place of the $7.7 million estimated
at acppraisal. Intensified supervision of the project is being maintained.
Ln. 746:  Highways Project; US$24 million loan of June 9, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
E'roject execution, which fell behind schedule initially due to
lengtliy Government procedures and changes in key personnel, is now proceeding,
satisfactorily. The estimated cost of the project has increased significantly,
m,lainly as a result of dollar devaluation.  One major road section may be elim-
inated from the project.   The Government has been requested to provide supple-
mentary funds to permit completion of the othier project components.

Ln. 779: Agricultural Credit Project; US$5 million loan and USS3 million
C-.      credit, both of July 12, 1971; Closing Dates:    July 31, 1975.
Disbursements are behind schedule, especially for mechanization of
grain farms and for dairy farms, since the cost of imported cows has risen
and there is competition between Bank/IDA and other cheaper funds. A severe
flood in 21arch 1973 also affected project progress. Consultations are underway
with a view to accelerating the progress of the project.
Cr. 270: Fisheries Project; US$2 million credit of September 24, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
After unsuccessful efforts to design a completely new and economical
vessel, it was decided to concentrate on improving construction techniques,
materials and design of t1he existing traditional inshore fishing boat. As a
restult of substantJal cost increases due to factors unrelated to the project,
the number of boats which can be procured will be reduced by about 5n percent.
However, demand for boats at the higher prices remains strong as fish prices
have also increased substantially. A procurement dispute delayed award of the
contract for mnarine diesel engines; this has now been resolved. The delivery
of the first equipped boats is expected in November 1974.
Ln. 858:  Tourism Infrastructure Project; US$14 million loan and USSIO million
Cr. 329: credit, botlh of September 28, 1972; Closing Dates: December 31, 1977.
The project experienced initial delays because of the time required
to adopt legislation establishing the public land corporation which is to ac-
quire land in the project zones for resale to investors. The development
studies for the six project zones, being executed by consultants, are almost
on schledule.  Invitations for bids for some project works have been issued.
A study of Government incentives for investmenit in tourism  is underway.  New
heads of the Mational Touirist Office (ONTT) and the project unit have been
appointedi.

Ln. 648:  Third Development Finance Company Project; US$10 million loan of
December 24, 1969; Closing Date: (original) December 31, 1973;
(current) September 30, 1974.
Ln. 798:   Fourth Development Finance Company Project; UJS$10 million loan of
February 9, 1972; Closing Date: March 31, 1976.
Ln. 881:  Fifth Development Finance Company Project; US$14 million loan of
February 20, 1973; Closing Date:   March 31, 1978.
Disbursements under Ln. 648 are almost complete; those under Ln. 798
are slightlv behind schedule, while disbursements under Ln. 881 are ahead of
schedule. Business greatly exceeded projections in 1973 and is continuing at
an accelerated rate. Persistent problems are the substantial amount of arrears
of hotel borrowers and the lack of valid mortgage security for certain sub-
loans; these are being closely watched. The dependence of BDET (ex-SNII) on
the Government and the IBRD is expected to be reduced by BDET's raising con-
siderable funds from local and other foreign sources and by discussions in
progress on Government-BDET financial arrangements.    A request for a sixth
loan is under consideration.
Ln. 937:  Tunis District Urban Planning and Public Transport Project; US$11
Cr. 432:  million loan and US$7 million credit, both of October 5, 1973;
Closing Dates: December 31, 1976.
Due to delays in appointment of consultants and preparation of the
necessarv legal opinions, the loan and credit for this project have not yet
become effective.   As the offer of the Tunisian supplier fell within 15 percent
o.' the international reference price agreed with the Bank/IDA, the public trans-
port company (SNT) has decided to award him the contract for supply of project
buses.
