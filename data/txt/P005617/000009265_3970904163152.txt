PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TUNISIA - GAFSA PHOSPHATE PROJECT
(LOAN 1042-TUN)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Gafsa Phosphate
Project in southern Tunisia, for which a Bank Loan (1042-TUN), for US$23.3
million, was approved in July 1974 to Compagnie des Phosphates de Gafsa (CPG).
Following the closing date in December 31, 1981, IND staff visited
Tunisia, in May 1982, and had discussions with the Government and the Borrower
for the preparation of this PCR. The Report reflects findings of this mission
as well as review of Project files and related documents. The purpose of the
Report is to present a retrospective factual review of Project implementation
and outcome. Comments from the Borrower have been taken into account in
finalizing the report and are reproduced in Annex IV.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TUNISIA- GAFSA PHOSPHATE PROJECT
(LOAN 1042-TUN)
HIGHLIGHTS
In the 60's the Tunisian phosphate industry entered a difficult
period. Increasing competition from other world producers such as Morocco
and USA kept prices low.  Production costs of Tunisian phosphate were high
due to low grade, unfavorable mining conditions, old installations and
overstaffing. Managerial problems and lack of expertise, added to the
difficulties.  Against this background, studies were contracted to foreign
consultants by Compagnie des Phosphates de Gafsa (CPG) to investigate
possibilities for expansion and modernization and to lower production
costs. The Sehib mine, which is the topic of the Gafsa Phosphate Project,
was a product of this quest.
The Sehib Project, based on reserves for 20 years of production,
involved development of a new underground mine employing the longwall
method with an annual output of 2.0 million tonnes per year of
gross-sorted-dry phosphate rock to be upgraded in a new waahing plant to
1.6 million tonnes per year of marketable 65/68% BPL rock for export. It
included all necessary auxiliary facilities such as water and power supply,
workshops, offices, housing and some minor roads. In parallel, the
railways company SNCFT was to supply, a 13 km spur line, rolling stock and
upgrading of the main line to the port in Sfax to handle the increased
production. The Sehib Project was conceived in parallel to CPG's
Modernization Program to be undertaken between 1974-78. Cost of the Sehib
Project, including interest during construction (IDC) and working capital
was estimated during appraisal in 1974 to be US$64.5 million. Cost of the
SNCFT infrastructure was estimated at US$10.9 million and cost of the
Modernization Program at US$51.3 million, both including IDC.
The Project's immediate objective was to improve CPG's production
capacity in volume and reduce its unit production costs by mastering a
modern, efficient mining method and beneficiation. A longer term objective
was to adapt the longwall particularly on the so-called Eastern sector
deposits which need an efficient underground method for exploitation.
The planned expansion of production and the reduction of unit costs have
not been achieved mainly due to lengthy trials of technical feasibility,
organizational and project management deficiencies of CPG. The longwall,
while finally operating as trial face, underlined the importance of
organizational and logistic resources for the successful employ of a
mechanized operation. In the absence of these resources, the viability of
the longwall remains unproven. A washing plant was built but is utilized
significantly below capacity (70% capacity utilization in 1983) through
improvised mining operations of limited life span because of (a) inability
of the Sehib mine to produce the expected amount of rock tonnages; and (b)
delays in complet4ng water wells and pipes necessary to provide the plant
with adequate water supply.



v 
In retrospect, the Project was ill conceived. Including the
Bank, CPG and the consultants, all involved parties failed to realize the
technical risks and project management requirements. While both the
Project authorities and the Bank investigated the technical and economic
feasibility of this operation during appraisal , they were too optimistic
as regards its technical feasibility and financial returns, in particular
since this was a new method. In particular, results from trial mines using
special longwall equipment were inaccurately extrapolated for a 2.0 million
tonnes per year operation. Project maragement was never properly
structured leading to excessive delays in installation, trial runs and
trial evaluation. Company organizational, labor and logistic resources
were not developed in parallel to support and assimilate the technology of
longwall which was new to the labor intensive Company and relatively new to
the phosphate mining industry.   Parallel to the implementation of the
Sehib Project, a continued dialogue between CPG and the Bank on the other
rationalization measures and investments was intended within the structure
of the Loan. While such discussions did take place, they had little effect
on the actions taken by CPG.
Some highlights on observations on the Project are summarized
below:
(i) Realization of Objectives
-   The immediate objective of the Project which was to increase
the productive capacity of CPG and reduce its unit costs has
not been achieved, and the differences between planned and
actuals have been very large.
-   Four longwalls were foreseen for 1977 to produce 2.0 million
tonnes per year starting 1979. Presently only one longwall
exists which has given its best performance in 1980 and 1981
with 0.4 million tonnes per year at a unit extraction cost
about twice the Company's average in the rest of its mines.
The high levels of extraction were never continuous enough to
assure an extraction of 1800 tonnes/workable day which is
what *'s needed on a 280-workable-days-a-year schedule to
attain 0.5 million tonnes per year per longwall. This level
was attained only for two months in 1980 and for four months
in 1981. In fact, insplte of thi-s performance, problems, be
it timely mine development or ventilation, do continue to
persist.
-   At the washing plant, planned to be ready in 1977, a
production of 1.6 million tonnes per year coming from 2.0
million tonnes per year feed was foreseen. The plant was
ready only in 1979 and the most active year was 1983 with a
feed of 2.0 million tonnes and 1.1 million tonnes output, a
70% utilization.



- vi -
-   Project cost with four longwalls was estimated at US$62
million. The actual cost with one longwall has amounted to
about US$67 million (65Z foreign) excluding sunk operating
costs and other related investments such as the Secteur 100
and Oum El Khecheb, this cost overrun being mainly due to the
delays in project completlon.
(ii) The Mine
- The longwall method was applied too fast without recognizing
the technology transfer implications, which involve well
structured project management arrangements for implementation
and well assimilated company logistic resources, as described
below, for operation. This is a highly mechanized, capital
intensive method whose unit costs are very sensitive to
discontinuity in production. A logistic build up in the
following key areas is still a prerequisite for any
mechanization to become viable:
p preventive maintenance
spare parts inventory policy
cost control
standards of performance
training for mechanized operations
training for organized team work
(iii) The Plant
- Construction delays were due to lack of proper management.
-  Low capacity utilization has been primarily due to (a) lack of
water, (b) failure of the Sehib mine to deliver expected
feed, and (c) inadequacy of training resulting in long
learning curve.
(iv) Planning and Cost Control in CPG
- Since 1975 an increase in investments, mechanization and
personnel is observed with no increase in tonnages mined
(excluding subcontracting) as opposed to an increase in feed
capacity of plant. Overall an increase in unit costs per
washed tonne is observed. A dispersement of plants and mines
within an area of 50 km has created complex pro-lems. All
this calls for planning and a rationalization of the existing
'traffic" between mines and plants.



- vii -
- The Company still lacks a system of quality and cost control,
standards of performance, timely preparation of reports.
These tools are essential to identify the problem centers and
define accordingly the priorities to be addressed as a
function of financial possibilities. They ought to be in
place before any capital intensive operation is undertaken.
(v) Financial Issues
- The financial situation of the Company has deteriorated in the
past with unexpected low phosphate prices, high unit costs and
an increase of its fixed assets by US$0.6 billion from 1975 to
1981. The liquidity ratio has come down from 2.7 in 1975 to
0.8 in 1981. The debt:equity ratio nas deteriorated from 8:92
in 1975 to 63:37 in 1981. Thus, our financial covenants of
1.3 for liquidity and 55:45 for debt:equity were mostly not
observed. A lesson may be that threat of suspension of the
loan should have been utilized earlier to ensure more timely
implementation of managerial efficiency and to avoid excessive
spending on new investments.
- With its present financial structure, CPG is in no position to
undertake a nev major investment project.
The longwall experience to date does not provide a valid basis
for the adoption of longwall mining in Tunisia. As long as CPG cannot
obtain or provide from its own in-house resources the logistic support
required to install and operate continously a planning-intensive mining
technique such as longwall faces, longwall mining cannot be considered a
viable proposition in the immediate future.
On the one hand, the trials have been completed successfully and
a technically feasible equipment configuration operated at projected output
levels during the trials. On the other hand, technical suitability alone
is insufficient for proving the long term viability of the longwall
technique. As long as the logistic support (organization, management,
maintenance, skilled labor, cost and parts control) is not ensured,
introduction of this method represents a major risk. As a result, the main
benefit of the work to date is the testing experience since 1970 providing
CPG personnel with a valuable exposure to this mechanized operation and
demonstrating the need for organizational and logistic improvement.
A continued cooperation between the Bank and CPG in the form of
technical assistant, is envisaged. Such technical assistance will involve
(a) a diagnostic study to identify means to improve organizational and
logistic deficiencies and to rationalize existing operations; plus (b)
evaluation of certain open pit deposits which offer lower risks and costs
compared to underground operations, in general.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
\.                             TUNISIA - CAFSA PHOSPHATE PROJECT
(LOAN 1042-TUN)
I.   INTRODUCTION
1.01      The following is a Project Completion Report for Gafsa Phosphate
Project prepared by the Mining and Non-Ferrous Metals Division of the
Industry Department. The Project is otherwise referred to as the Sehib
Project. A loan was extended to the Compagnie des Phosphates de Gafsa
(CPG) on October 1, 1974 by IBRD in the equivalent amount of US$23.3
million to finance imported equipment and consultant services for the Sehib
mine development and beneficiation plant in the Gafsa region. The Loan was
made for 15 years including 3 years of grace at an assumed interest rate of
7-1/4Z plus a guarantee fee of 1-3/4Z. The Loan is referred to as Loan
TUN-1042. The closing date of this Loan was December 31, 1981.
1.02      The Sehib Project, based on ore reserves estimated at appraisal
to be sufficient for 20 years of production, involved development of a new
underground mine at Sehib employing the longwall method with a projected
annual output of 2.0 million tonnes per year (mtpy) of gross-sorted-dry
(BTS) phosphate rock to be upgraded by washing to 1.6 mtpy of marketable
65/68% BPL (1.00% BPL - 0.46% P205) rock for export.  The Sehib Project
also included all the necessary auxiliary facilities such as water and
power supply, workshops, offices, housing and some minor roads. Parallel
to the Sehib Project the railways company SNCFT was to supply, a 13 km spur
line, rolling stock and upgrading of the main line to the port in Sfax to
handle the increase in production. The Sehib Project was conceived in
parallel to CPG's Modernization Program to be undertaken between 1974-78.
Cost of the Sehib Project, including interest during construction (IDC) and
working capital was estimated during appraisal in 1974 to be US$64.5
million. Cost of the SNCFT infrastructure was estimated at US$10.9 million
and cost of the Modernization Program at US$51.3 million, both including
IDC.
1.03      The Loan corresponds to about 7.5% of IBRD disbursement to
Tunisia between 1975 and 1981. It is one of the four industrial projects
financed by the Bank in Tunisia during the seventies. Its economic
objectives were to promote the second best Tunisian national resource
beside crude oil and develop competitive exports while also helping one of
the most deprived areas of the country.
1.04      CPG, the beneficiary of the Loan, is an old company.  Its roots
go back to 1887 when it was formed as "Societe Anonyme' with headquarters
in Paris after the discovery of phosphate reserves in 1886 near Metlaoui.
In 1896 authorities granted concessions and exploitation started in
Metlaoui. Output increased as new deposits such as Redeyef (1906/12) and
Moulares (1919/23) were opened. Initially the rock was marketed
dry-and-handsorted. Beneficiation began after Morocco started exploiting
its high grade ore and it took roots particularly in the 50's with the



- 2 -
Redeyef (air classification) and Metlaoui (3 washeries) plants. The
Company joined the cartel CPAN in 1930 and remained in it until 1960, which
restricted it to exports of 1.5 million tonnes a year with regulated price
and sale conditions. In 1960, after Independence, the private shareholders
offered the Government a 50% equity participation which was paid at DN 2.5
million between 1961-64. The Company later in the 60's acquired the
phosphate mining company CIPHOS as part of a settlement of a previous
railway concession it had. This acquisition brought with it among other
things the then operating M'Dilla mine and concessions on the newly
discovered Sehib, Kef Eddour and Sra Ouertane deposits. In 1962, the
headquarters was transferred to Tunis.
1.05      In 1982, CPG is operating 9 mines and 14 beneficiation plants.
Most mining is undergroundl/ except for 2 open pit mines2/ producing a
third of the mine output. About three quarters of realizable feed capacity
in beneficiation plants comes from washeries3/ with the rest coming from
air classification and drying plants.4/ Realizable mine extraction
capacity is 10 mtpy of BTS rock. Realizable plant feed capacity is 12 mtpy
of BTS rock with a realizable output capacity of 8 mtpy of beneficiated
rock. In 1981, mine output was 8 mtpy and plant output was 5 mtpy. CPG is
the only phosphate rock producer in Tunisia. Its rock exports account for
2-3% of world phosphate rock trade and its domestic sales help Tunisia
maintain about 10% of world P205 trade. In 1981, CPG exported 1.0 mtpy of
beneficiated rock and sold 3.2 mtpy to domestic markets. The Company
employs about 13,750 people of whom 2% are professionals. The Company is
owned almost entirely by the State.
II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
2.01      In the 60's the Tunisian phosphate industry entered a difficult
period. Increasing competition from other world producers such as Morocco
and USA kept prices low. However, production costs of Tunisian phosphate
were high due to relatively low grade of the deposits; relatively
unfavorable mining conditions; old installations for mining, beneficiation
and transport; and overstaffing of the operations due to lack of other
employment opportunities. Managerial problems and lack of expertise,
partly as an aftermath of the industry's nationalization in the early 60's
added to the difficulties. Against this background studies were contracted
to foreign consultants to investigate possibilities for expansion and
modernization of the industry with the objective to lower production

costs. In 1966, a foreign engineering company completed a report on
existing installations and possible new projects in the Tunislan phosphate
mining industry. In this report, the Sehib Project achieved the highest
rate of return in comparison with other, not yet fully explored sirface
mine prospects. Following this review, the Sehib Project, located in the
poorly develcped southern region with little employment opportunities,
received priority ranking by the Tunisian authorities. In 1968, another
mining consulting company prepared a report commending on CPG's plans for
mine development in the area around Sehib (Djellabia, M'Dilla aud Sehib
itself). The report confirmed that mining at Sehib could be expected to
involve about the same conditions and production costs as the neighboring
existing M'Dilla mine.  CPG envisaged a mechanized longwall mining system
from the outset. The mining consultant, however, advised to pursue the
Project only after successful operation of a trial longwall.
2.02      In 1968, the Tunisian Government submitted a request to the UNDP
Special Fund for assistance in developing a master plan for the Improvement
of the phosphate industry in the Gafsa Basin. This was in parallel to
other ongoing or proposed studies In the sector amongst which three new
development projects Kef Eschfair (2.0 mtpy BTS), Sehib (4.0 mtpy, BTS) and
Kef Eddour (1.0 mtpy BTS) to produce rock for beneficiation at 73% BPL were
already being considered for inclusion in the 1969-72 Investment Plan. The
Tunisian authorities were contemplating Bank involvement in such
developments and requested the Bank's comments oa the Draft Contract for
engineering services on the development of these three mines. The Bank in
its comments pointed out to the necessity of waiting for the results of the
beneficiation tests and the market study undertaken by outside consultants
before fixing the production targets in volume and grade for the
feasibility studies contemplated within the scope of such contract.
Furthermore, the necessity of coordinating the phosphate development plans
with other infrastructural developments and downstream facilities was
pointed out. Subsequently, r foreign engineering company was given the
contract but only the Sehib proposal was studied and that at a target
production level of 2.0 mtpy BTS as determined by CPG to give a 1.6 mtpy
marketable rock of 65/68% BPL. The marketing study was completed in
mid-1970 and concluded that Tunisia could find markets for 6-7 mtpy
primarily in 65/68Z BPL rock.
2.03      Meanwhile in 1968, CPG had ordered equipment for longwall trials
with financial assistance from KfW. The longwall method had been well
tried and proven in coal mines, but its use on harder rock such as
phosphate was limited to two faces over 5-6 years in Moroccan phosphate
mines. The feasibility study was completed in mid-1971 conceiving a mine
uLilizing the longwall method along with an adjacent new washing plant at
the above production targets. The study was completed awaiting conclusive
resulta from the operation of the trial longwall. The trial longwall was
installed and trial mining started in December 1970.
2.04      The period from late 1970 until appraisal in 1974 was
characterized by trial mining with interruptions to modify equipment. Roof

control, mechanical malfunctions, breakdown of the shearing machine and
unavailability of spare parts were among the major problems. Nevertheless,
it was believed by all concerned, including the Bank, that mechanical
modifications such as closed rather than simple supports, a plow instead of
a shearer and a narrower conveyor would provide the continuity in high
output production. Decision to make these modifications was taken in
February 1974 and the same longwall supplier, under a performance guarantee
for 2,000 tonnes BTS per day over a two month period, entered into a
contract with CPG to equip and operate this new modified longwall. The new
longwall was installed in April 1975, after Bank's appraisal in February
1974.
2.05      The Tunisian authorities indicated their preference for Bank
financing over supplier's credit in mid-72. From the beginning, the Bank
emphasized upgrading CPG and reviewing the total Tunisian phosphate
industry with the objective of modernizing and rationalizing it to restore
its competitiveness among other world producers. Assurances were obtained
from CPG that it would improve its managerial effectiveness through proper
planning,. control and inernal coordination. Annually updated five-year
investment programs were to be prepared and sent to the Bank for review.
The Company was also financially upgraded through an increase in equity
participation by the Government. At the request of the Bank, a planning
unit was established at CPG and a Modernization Program was drawn up in
1973 to Improve safety and efficiency and to lower the costs of the
Company's existing operations. In addition to new projects, Sehib being
one of them, the Modernization Program was to increase production from
existing operations to 3.9 mtpy (20% above 1973 level) of beneficiated rock
by 1977. Although not financed under the Bank's Loan, the Modernization
Program was to be parallel to the Sehib Project. The Company agreed to
strengthen its staff for planning and implementing the Modernization
Program and to update the Program annually in consultation with the Bank
(Loan Agreement, sections 4.02 and 5.04). Since the Modernization Program
would reduce the Company's manpower, a study of alternative development
possibilities in the region (Regional Development Study), such as livestock
development and artisan activities, to be carried out by the Government was
also linked to the Sehib Project.
2.06      The appraisal mission was undertaken in February 1974.  The
Project centered on the installation of new phosphate mining and
beneficiation facilities at the Sehib deposit, consisting of the following:
(a) an underground mine, to be equipped with 4 longwalls, with
an annual capacity of about 2.0 million tonnes BTS of
phosphate ore (Loan Agreement, schedule 2, part A);
(b) a washing and drying plant producing 1.6 mtpy of 65/68% BPL
rock; connected to the mine with a 6 km long conveyor; and
including storage facilities, repair shops and offices (Loan
Agreement, schedule 2, part B).

2.07      For the above installations, the Bank Loan was to finance the
purchase of equipment up to US$23.0 million- An additional US$0.3 million
were included in the Loan to finance consultant services for the Regional
Development Study.
2.08      Parallel to the above, the Project included provision of
infrastructure by CPG consisting of:
-   water supply over 32 km distance;
-   power distribution to mine and beneficiation plant;
-   7 km of new roads between the mine and the beneficiation
plant;
-   upgrading the existing 9 km dirt road connecting Sehib with
M'Dilla into an all-weather road;
-   100 additional houses at M'Dilla.
2.09      Total project cost plus IDC and working capital for above
installat±ons, consultant services and infrastructure were estimated at
US$64.5 million (44.6 foreign and 19.9 local) of which US$41.2 million vere
to be contributed by the company and US$23.3 million by the Bank's Loan.
2.10      In addition to the above, the Project required transportation
infrastructure not falling under CPG's responsibility.  The work involved
improvement and extension of railway facilities by SKCFT: a 13 km spur line
frra M'Dilla to the Sehib plant, about 450 additional cars, minor upgrading
of the Metlaoui-Sfax track and some additional locomotives. This required
an investment of US$10.9 and was to be financed by a loan from the African
Development Bank (ADB).
2.11      The Bank Loan was negotiated in June 1974. There were no special
conditions for the effectiveness of the Loan. It became effective on March
1975.
2.12      Right after appraisal Morocco, the price leader for phosphate
rock more than tripled world market prices. This allowed the Company to
register a substantial net income compared to a long history of net losses
until 1973. While prices decreased steadily over the following four years
leading to renewed losses for the Company by 1977, the hike removed the
sense of urgency to get the Sehib Project working and improve Company
operations in general for tne crucial period of project implementation.
The new circumstances also reduced the Bank's leverage in getting CPG's
full cooperation to follow Bank recommendations.

Achievement of Objectives
3.02      The immediate objective - improvement of the Company's production
capacity in volume and unit cost through a modern, efficient mining method
and beneficiation - has not been achieved:
(a) The mine has, so far, failed to turn out the envisaged
production. Only one longwall face is installei ai.er
trials have been completed, i.e. 25% of planned installed
longwall. In 1981, the year of highest production ever
attained, 500 thousand tonnes BTS were produced of which 400
thousand tonnes BTS came from longnall extraction. This
constitutes 20% of the initial target with one quarter of
the planned longwall equipment installed or 80Z of the
production expected per longwall. The extraction costs in
'80-'81 have been about US$21-24 compared to a Company
average of about US$11-12.
(b) The washing plant has been completed with a delay of two
years. HoDwever, as the trial phase did not give timely
results to allow full development of the mine and because of
insufficient water supply (paras. 4.09-4.11), the plant
cannot yet be operated at full capacity. The main raw
phosphate ore is now obtained from Sector 100 and Oum El
Khecheb, two surface mines located about 25 km. from the
plant. In 1981, about 900 thousand tonnes of ore from
Secteur 100 and 120 thousand tonnes of ore from Oum El
Khecheb were mined and trucked to the Sehib plant by a
contractor. This, together with ore from Sehib (350 tonnes
in 1981) presently keep the washing plant operating at about
5O0 capacity.
3.03      The longwall experience to date does not provide a valid basis
for the adoption of longwall mining in Tunisia. Extraction has been very
low and fluctuating (paras. 4.02-4.08). The method proved to be highly
capital intensive and require skilled dependable workers, managers and
spare parts supply. As long as the CPG cannot obtain or provide from its
own in-house resources, the logistic support required to install and
operate continuously a planning-intensive mining technique such as longwall
faces, longwall mining cannot be considered a viable proposition in the
immediate future.
3.04      On the one hand, the trials have been completed successfully and
a technically feasible equipment configuration operated at projected output
levels during the trials. On the other hand, technical suitability alone
is insufficient for proving the long term viability of the longwall
technique. As long as the logistic support (organization, management,
maintenance, skilled labor, cost and parts control) is not ensured,
introduction of this method represents a major risk. As a result, the main
benefit of the work to date is the testing experience since 1970 providing



-9-
CPG personnel with a valuable exposure to this mechanized operation and
demonstrating the need for organizational and logistic improvement.
3.05       With the outlook of the Sehib underground mine not providing the
required output in the immediate future, the development of economic
alternative ore supplies has become an urgent task. A feasibility study
for the nearby surface mineable Djellai,ia deposit started in June 1980 with
foreicgn consultants under Bankl/ and USAID financing.  In late 1982,
supplementary geological and flotation tests are being completed to proceed
onto the full feasibiiiity stage. If the Djellabia deposit were to be
exploited, this would not be before 1987. In the interim, visual outcrops
at the Secteur 100 and Oum El Khecheb deposits which are supplying the
plant are expected to be depleted by 1986 and 1991 respectively. Finally,
the nearby Sehib South deposit as well as the main Oum El Khecheb deposit
are alternatives to be studied for eventual open pit exploitation.
Nevertheless, any of these operations will require several years of
implementation and considerable additional investments.
Project Scope-and Changes-in Scope
3.06       Table 2 succinctly identifies the changes in scope.  Most changes
directly or indirectly relate to the failure of the longwall method to
provide the expected production. Consequently, deletions from, inclusions
in and modifications to the initial scope are in response to alternative
solutions sought to provide rock for the plant.

3.07      The poor performance in project implementation, lack of
cooperation by CPG to follow up on remedial suggestions agreed to with Bank
supervision missions and breach of covenants in the Loan Agreement prompted
the Bank to issue a letter in June 1978 threatening suspension of the Loan
unless remedial action was taken. In parallel, CPG had decided to (a)
bring in the technical assistance of foreign longwall operators to improve
mine output; (b) examine alternative ore deposits to supply the plant
whereby exploitation of Secteur 100 and evaluation of Djellabia started;
(c) reinstate the original firm to assist with project management and
complete the plant; and (d) raise the Company's sensitivity to planning and
cost control even though a proper mechanism to deal with these aspects in a
timely, systematic fashion is still absent.
3.08      Considering the objective of increasing rock extraction and
reducing overall Company unit costs, the question whether a surface mining
project would not have been more appropriate than an underground mining
project became apparent during the implementation of the Project. Although
the potential of surface mining was not fully known by appraisal, it is
apparent that surface mining was given enough consideration at the early
project preparation stage as a possibly easier and more viable alternative
to underground mining. There was a bias for underground mining as CPG
wanted to adapt a mechanized underground method to be able to exploit its
deposits on the Eastern sector. Since then, Kef Eschfair, a surface mining
project of 2.5 mtpy which was already concepted in 1970 during the Sehib
feasibility study, was later on implemented. It was completed successfully
in 1980 and today shows higher returns than the Sehib Project. Sector 100
has been opened. Djellabia is under study. Kef Eddour, Sehib South and
Oum El Khecheb are considered for surface mining.
3.09      Considering the objective of determining an appropriate
underground method for the Sehib region, the question remains whether it
was prudent to aim from the start for a production level of 2.0 mtpy with a
modern technology, yet unproven in Tunisian phosphate. In retrospect, the
decision to appraise after the input of three years of trials (1971-73)
appear to have been prematurely taken. Obviously more testing was needed
before a full size mining and beneficiation project was conceived. The
phased approach starting with one instead of all four longwalls allowed for
the continuation of the mine tests, however, the plant was prematurely
built. With the momentum of a full sized mining and beneficiation project,
it was too late to prevent the construction of the mine based beneficiat4on
plant after it became apparent that the mine would not be in a position to
supply feedstock at the plant's full capacity.
3.10      The Regional Development Study as well as the control of the
Company's Modern4zation Program did not succeed. The former was declared
unnecessary by Tunisian authorities, because it became apparent that new
investment programs would not release any more labor from CPG's
operations.  Instead, a Retrospective Evaluation of CPG activities between
1975-80 was undertaken which proved to be a most useful exercise. CPG did
a commendable job with frank and constructive self-criticism to delineate
its own problem areas. Hopefully, it will be used for guiding future



- 11 -
planning within CPC. In addition, the proceeds of the Loan category for
the Regional Study were used for outside project management to install and
operate the longwall face at design capacity, thus proving its technical
feasibility. The latter, the review of the Modernization Program and
follow-up on its implementation has proven to be a complex and time
consuming task which could not be effectively achieved in view of the lack
of CPG cooperation and the Bank staff allocation for Project supervision.
There were many disagreements on the Program between the Bank and CPG, the
latter often following its own route against the advice of the Bank and
Loan Covenants.
Project Management and Performance of Consultants
3.11      A foreign consulting firm assisted the Company in the
engineering, procurement, supervision and start-up of all project
components. The same Project Management (PM) assistance firm had also
performed the initial feasibility study. The firm has considerable
experience and is adequately qualified for these tasks as far as they
relate to the washing plant and surface installations. However, it has
little experience in underground mining and therefore occasional assistance
from the foreign mining consultants that had studied Sehib in 1968 was
obtained. After it became obvious (1977/78) that mine development was far
behind and the mine would not be in a position to achieve the required
output, a foreign mining company with longwall expertise, was contracted by
CPG as project manager, at the Bank's request, to run the trial tests for a
six-month period.
3.12      The project lacked proper project management set up:
(a) The contract with the foreign consulting firm was for project
management assistance and thus responsibilities in some
critical areas such as procurement and on-site supervision
were not worked out in detail.
(b) Staffing plan for the PM assistance firm and CPG's key
personnel was not complete at time of contract signature.
Critical tasks such as on-site supervision were partially
left open to availability of staff. The PM assistance firm
had only two people on site who would coordinate with their
headquarters abroad through poor telephone connections. A
lot of work would be carried out at headquarters abroad and
CPG would get final plans, specifications, etc. This soon
resulted in resentment by CPG.
(c) In the absence of well defined responsibilities, lack of
coordination emerged between CPG and the PM assistance
firm. This, coupled with the resentment, resulted in CPG
being unwilling to delegate. In fact, CPG terminated the PM
assistance contract in December 1977 and reinstated it later
only at Bank's request. CPG, however, lacked experience in
projects of similar size and complexity.



-12-
3.13      A well designed washing plant (Pack. 6) capable of producing
within specifications (para. 4.01) was built eventually. Some portions,
such as the product loading (Pack. 3C) and phosphate handling facilities
(Packs. 5, 8) were completed in 1981, well after the PM assistance firm
had left. This, however, as well as the late completion of other plant
components, is entirely due to the managerial deficiencies mentioned above.
3.14      The role of the mining consultants during construction was
limited to studies for alternative ore supplies to the Sehib plant once the
mine failed to meet expectations. By end of 1977 there was no acceptable
production levels attained by the longwall method (TLble 11). The limited
role given to the mining consultants and organizational deficiencies of CPG
prevented timely improvements. The Bank recommended that technical
assistance for the longwall be obtained from an experienced firm.
3.15      The foreign longwall expert firm's first assignment in removing
technical difficulties with the longwall started in 1978. It pointed out
weak technical areas but did not succeed in obtaining sustained higher
production during this first campaign, mainly because of lack of spare
parts. A further contract was signed with them in late 1979, again at
Bank's recommendation. In this contract, the expert firm committed itself
under penalty to reach production of 1400 tonnes per day (tpd) of BTS rock
by June 1980 from the installed longwall at Sehib. The work started late
February 1980. The expert firm staffed key positions (supervisors,
operators, mechanics and electricians) with its own personnel from their
own coal mines abroad and took direct control of spare parts supply. This
contract proved to be a success. Due to their good practical experience in
longwall mining and an extraordinary effort, the firm together with CPG,
achieved the production target, and over a short term even substantially
exceeded it (para. 4.03). Thus, it was demonstrated, at least technically,
that the longwall system can deliver the required production output in
Tunisian phosphate.
3.16      In conclusion, the longwall experts did an outstanding job while
lack of a project management contract from the outset, with direct project
management responsibilities given to the proper experts, resulted in major
delays. If responsibility were given earlier to mining consultants for
mine development, problems related to longwall mining could have been
recognized in advance and remedies or alternatives sought in time. CPG's
less than cooperative attitude with the Bank and the various consultants
also had a negative impact on the Project. Advice given to CPG was either
ignored or implemented with much delay.
Implementation Schedule
3.17      Appraisal estimate for Project completion was 3rd quarter of
1977. By thlat time, the plant would have been commissioned and gone into
production, with raw phosphate being supplied from four longwall units ±n
full production. Due to the failure of achieving the expected production
rate with the first longwall, the scope and implementation of Project
components changed considerably (Table 2). Present status, compared to
appraisal estimate, is summarized below:

3.18      Details concerning changes in implementation schedule are given
in Annex I. The changes in the Sehib mine and the conveyor to the plant
are due to failure of achieving full production from longwall 1 (para.
4.03). The delay in the completion of the plant is due to managerial
(para. 3.12) as well as procurement related (para. 3.20) difficulties. In
retrospect also the appraisl implementation schedule for the long walls may
have been too optimistic since this was a new method for CPG. Regarding
infrastructure, delays have occured in the completion of each and all
components (water, 1982; electricity, 1981; roads, 1978; housing units,
1982; spurline, 1979) mainly because of slippage in the plant construction
plus because failure at the mine caused shifts in plans. Amongst these,
water conduit also encountered problems of its own: (i) scaling and
corosion reduced the water flows from the wells, (ii) the 32 km pipeline

was ill constructed. Remedies are being sought to address both problems by
CPG (para. 4.10).
Procurement and Performance of Suppliers/Contractors
3.19      Procurement for Bank financed equipment was carried out according
to International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedure. Exception was made
for spare parts for the longwall mining equipment. Domestic suppliers were
given a preference of 15% in all ICB. Packages financed by the Bank are
shown in Table 4 and the share of supplier countries in Table 5.

3.20      ICB was an appropriate procurement method for the packages
involved under Bank financing. However, in this Project ICB also helped
highlight some of the managerial problems. Deviations from the Bank's
procurement guidelines have been a serious problem. The Bank had to
decline approval on a number of technically and financially unjustifiable
bid awards. Parallel to this there were two bankruptcies. Separate
contracts were placed with subcontractors to complete these packages (3C, 4
and 8 on Table 4). At that time, relations between CPG and their PN
assistance firm were again strained, and contracts were directly worked out
by CPG. In total, the bankruptcies may have caused a delay of about 27
months in Project completion.
3.21      The underground mining equipment for the longwall was purchased
from a well respected manufacturer for this type of equipment. The
manufacturer rented this equipment on a trial basis to be bought after
successful results were obtained. Despite extensive guarantees by
thesupplier that the equipment would be adequate to meet the planned
production under existing conditions, the phosphate winning unit, a plough,
presented technical problems and in 1976 it was replaced by a shearer
procured from a different supplier as it was not in the former's
manufacturing program. The failure of the plough is no indication of
inferiour equipment quality or gross misjudgement of the supplier as to the
capabilities of their equipment. No operational experience with the plow
in Tunisian phosphate was available. Trials before Project conception were
done with a shearer only. Its failure may be looked upon as one of the
inherent risks in a mining project, particularly regarding unknowns in rock
behavior.

3.23      Project costs, as listed above, refer to a project which changed
considerably in scope from appraisal (Table 2). The basic difference are
as follows:
-   one longwall instead of four at Sehib mine
-   no conveyor from Sehib mine to washing plant
-   unforeseen opening of Sector 100 surface mine to feed Sehib
plant (mainly contractor mining)
-   unforeseen technical assistance for the mine to improve
longwall performance
-   unforeseen feasibility study for alternative Djellabia mine
to feed Sehib plant
-   Regional Development Study was never undertaken.

Prorated to one longwall under following assumptions:
-   mine equipment and development 25% of appraisal
-   plant equipment and civil works 100% of appraisal
-   others 100% of appraisal.
3.24      The variances are extremely high.  rne mine equipment variance is
due to: (a) large spare part purchases unforeseen during appraisal because
of unexpectedly long duration of testing period; and (b) purchase of an
underground conveyor for four rather than one longwall. The high mine
development variance reflects the long-duration/low-production test period
and consists of the sunk operating costs during the period net of
depreciation and value of extracted rock. The variances are also high for
the plant and the other components primarily because of delays in
implementation schedule that reached four years altogether.

3.25      Table 8 shows the actual disbursement of the Bank's Loan and the
appraisal estimate. Disbursements started about 18 months later than
appraisal estimates and extended over five years as compared to the three
years estimated at appraisal. These delays are a consequence of project
management deficiencies discussed earlier (para. 3.12) plus the
misfortunate selection of the plough which resulted in 18 fruitless months
of testing.

3.27      The total financing of the US$64.5 million estimated at appraisal
was to be covered 36% (US$23.3 million) by the Bank's loan and 64Z (US$41.2
million) by CPG's internal cash generation. With CPG finances declining
and Project costs increasing, outside financial support of about US$12.5
million or 13Z was obtained. (To that we should add principal repayments

made by CPG prior to the closing date.  These amount to US$7.4 million in

CPG, but includes IDC.
3.28      Finally, there is the SNCFT infrastructure which was outside the
scope of the Project and was estimated at US$10.9 million to be financed by
an ADB loan. The work involved upgrading the Metlaoui-Gafsa-Sfax (240 km)
railway. The work started in 1975 and by end of 1981 there were about 30
km remaining in areas near Meknessy. This route presently accommodates 4.0
mtpy of phosphate rock. A new railroad connecting GAFSA to Gabes is being
completed presently. The cost is about US$26 million and half of it has
been financed by the EIB. When this route comes on stream in 1983 it will
carry part of the phosphate load.
Information Systems and Reporting
3.29      One of the major organizational deficiencies in CPG has been lack
of strong middle management. A lot of technical reports are generated
within CPG which are constantly fed to top management for use in investment
planning. However, such reports have often been based on an inadequate
cost control system within the Company and nave often drawn parallels from
studies in other mines rather than a thorough analysis of particular
conditions in a given deposit. Investment plans have changed constantly
within the Company, financial projections and budgets have not been close
to actuals and preliminary financial statements for a given year's
performance have often been in dev4ation from audited reports that came too
late to be of any use for planning.

with some limited use of room and pillar method. Before start-up of the
Sehib washing plant (1979), the Sehib mine output was sent to the washing
plant at M'Dilla. Table 11 shows the estimated vs. actual production from
the Sehib mine.

4.04      Following the longriall trials in the years 1971-73, the first new
longwall was installed in 1975. The older tests were carried out with a
shearer the new longwall was equipped with a plow. According to the
supplier and the Moroccan experience, this had several advantages in
phosphate. However, the new machine proved not to be successful mainly due
to lack of control of floor gradient, and in 1976 it Was decided to change
back to a shearer. After its installation, it became apparent that the
conveyor, designed for application of a plow,. had to be reinforced. During
the first years of operation it was learned that roof pressure was high,
that the phosphate tended to break in great lumps and that pulling forces
for conveyor chains and cutting equipment were high. Adequate technical
solutions through modifications to equipment and adoption of operation
parameters, such as face length and method of advancing equipment had to be
found and were found in 1980, when good production rates were achieved.
The initial difficulties are considered an inherent risk of an underground
mining project and do occur in comparable form in many other mining
projects. A time span of two-four years to overcome such problems may be
considered not unusual. Despite the experienced difficulties, the longwall
mining technique can be considered technically suitable for underground
mining of Tunisian phosphate. However, despite the guarantees and
experience of the equipment supplier, it proved to be wrong, to assume that
success could be achieved easily and within a short time period.
4.05      Absenteeism and high manpower turnover, due to the more difficult
working environment, are further risks and difficulties of underground
mining. These factors have more adverse impact in a mechanized than in a
non-mechanized mine. In particular, key technical staff, familiar with the
working environment of the underground mine, must always be available
(para. 4.06).  In Tunisia, this problem is emphasized in so far as it is
generally difficult to attract qualified technical personnel to the
desert-like GAFSA region, irrespective of whether their working place would
be underground or on surface. In view of these personnel difficulties and
the geological/technical difficulties described in para. 4.04 above,
mechanized underground mining would not appear to be the most appropriate
technology, as long as reasonable possibilities for surface mining, which
carries a lower risk and cost, still exist. The later development of
different surface mines in the vicinity of Sehib (para. 3.05) suggests that
those possibilities do exist.
4.06      In addition to the above technical difficulties, there were (and
still are) managerial and training deficiencies which caused delays in the
mine development. One of the major manifestations thereof is the chronical
lack of spare parts supply in Tunisia compared to European mines, which are
near the manufacturer. The only way to overcome this is through adoption
of systematic preventive maintenance with good spare part inventories,
strict control of stocks and timely reordering. It is believed that with a
good maintenance and spare parts supply policy (established early with the
assistance of the suppliers and of an experienced operating company), many
of the delays and production shortages could have been avoided. As for the
training of key technical staff (foreman, machine operators, electricians
and mechanics), while assistance during the start-up from equipment
manufacturers proved to be valuable, it should have been followed up by a
well defined and tightly controlled training program of CPG. As experience



- 22 -
with the longwall experts has shown, a project management and operational
assistance contract with an experienced operating company to set up the
needed logistic control and support system, to implement a training program
and operate the face initially would have been most beneficial and could
have considerably shortened the learning curve.
4.07     The validity of the above observations are exemplified in Table
12 where the dramatic impact of expert intervention is indicated. The
foreign firm first entered the picture in July 1978. They started by
determining the spare parts needed, organized the work for upgrading the
equipment and defined the organizational and personnel needs of the Sehib
seat as well as of the team to work at the face underground. They put
people with appropriate qualifications and procured sufficient spare parts
to last for the six-month testing period. They completed their mission in
June 1980 having obtained an output level over and above the targeted
minimum of 1400 tonnes/workable day. Following that, a gradual transfer of
responsibility to CPG was effected until end of 1980. However, the daily
output during this interim was not as good, particularly because of a
transfer of the equipment to a new working face. Nevertheless, the
experts' February 1981 report summarizes their findings and states that a
1400 t/day output can be attained by CPG staff in the future provided that
training is continued, proper supervision and organization is maintained at
the work face and regular maintenance of equipment with a proper spare
parts inventory policy is established.
4.08     CPG, working alone since January 1981, has, in fact, attained a
performance of 1800-2400 tonnes/workable day between January and April
1981. However, the output declined sharply towards the end of the working
panel and a five-month stoppage followed due to delays in preparing the new
face, the transfer of the equipment to this new face and the intervening
holidavs. Extraction from the new face started in December 1981 at about
1150 tonnes/workable day and had to be stopped by mid-January 1982 due to
ventilation problems. In April 1982, at the time of the completion
mission, extraction was still stopped.

4.10      The washing plant was used in 1983 at 70% of its output
capacity. The plant was completed in 1979 for an output capacity of 1.6
mtpy washed and dry rock based on laboratory yields of 80%. In practice,
the plant capacity may be less due to lower quality input than expected.
Its output has been 150, 700 and 800 thousand tonnes of washed and dried
rock in 1979, 1980 and 1981, respectively. The plant never reached its
capacity because of four reasons:
(a) The Sehib mine did not deliver the expected feed. An attempt
was made to temporarily remedy this by exploiting two nearby
outcrops called Secteur 100 and Oum El Khecheb.
(b) Water has not been sufficiently provided to the plant. The
water is carried from Guiffla through a 32 km pipeline.
Three wells plus one reserve, each of 75 1/sec, are needed
for the plant. Scaling and corrosion have reduced these
flows to 0, 40, 40 and 60 1/sec. CPG has added a new well in
1980 pumping 60 1/sec and is yet working on a new one for
1982. Also they are working on replacing the pump strainers
by inoxidized material while also treating the scaling
problem by javelle water.
Cc) The 32 km pipeline is not properly constructed and problems
continue with pipe junctions and with the electrical
signaling system. This is still being discussed with the
local contractor and pipe manufacturer from whom CPG is still
witholding disbursement of about US$600,000. The pLpeline
package is the-only one amongst all the project packages that
has not yet been formally received by CPG. This package was
financed by CPG funds and supplier credits.
(d) The dryer section of the plant had some technical problems
with the refractory and the fixing of the rotationary crown.
These problems were not resolved until 1980.
4.11      At present time, ore sizing problems and lack of water are a key
factors in the underutilization of the plant's capacity.  Therefore,
Secteur 100 and Oum El Khecheb output has been directed to other nearby
plants with surplus capacity as shown in Table 14.

Environmental Implications
4.12      The Project is located in a desert area on land that lacks
prospects for agricultural development due to arid climate and lack of
adequate water. The surrounding area over a 50 km. stretch is a phosphate
mining district where the major employer is the CPG. The mining method, in
principle, results in caving with surface subsidence of up to one meter.
However, no structures or infrastructure overlie the deposit. Ventilation
in the mine has been a problem when mine development was not adequately on
schedule; however, this is mostly related to Company deficiencies in
planning for face transfers of the equipment after exploiting a panel. In
the plant, the rejects are coarse marl stockpiled next to the plant and
sludge dumped in the seasonal river basin. The chemicals involved in the
sludge are macromolecular added at the decantation pools to settle the
solids. Those remain on the argilaceous surface as the sludge dries and do
not penetrate the water basin which is some 600 m deep. Some washing does
occur during the rainy season and potential for contamination of water at
the so called chott or depression areas exists where water is near
surface. While CPG has conducted no formal tests to this effect, they
claim no indications of contamination exist. Nevertheless, CPG is
undertaking studies to dimension secluded pit areas for dumping the slimes
in the future. Some javelle treatment in water wells has been done against
scaling of pumps but that has been on a one time spot basis and not
continuously.
4.13      On an overall Company level a major rationalization is needed
which should take environmental concerns into account. Occupational health
and safety problems exist in CPG's mine and surface activities which are
related to underground roof conditions, insufficient underground mechanized
transportation and dust emission-all mostly due to ill adapted or old and
inefficient equipment. Some improvement has been brought in with the
mechanization-modernization attempts of the last six to eight years.
However, poor planning and lack of know-how to properly adapt, maintain and
utilize mechanization undermines the potential benefits in store.
Manpower Development
4.14      Table 15 shows the actual manpower employed by the project (mine
and plant) and compares it with appraisal estimate.

-25-
4.15      Considering the change in scope of the Project, the actual
figures compare unfavorably with appraisal estimates. Despite the
additional working places generated by the Sehib Project, CPG expected at
appraisal a net manpower surplus of 860 men over the years 1974-1979, due
to a general surplus of unproductive labor and the impact of the
Modernization Program. At present, CPG's total workforce is 14 thousand
men, compared with 12 thousand at appraisal, so that in effect an increase
of the overall workforce took place. Historically, the employment profile
of the Company has been as shown in Table 16. The figures that appear show
a workforce far above CPG's needs with a content of qualified professionals
far below CPG's needs.
Table 16: Work Force of CPG
'75      '76      '77       '78       '79     '80     '81

4.16     Whereas the recruitment and training of staff for the washing
plant did not present difficulties, due to CPG's familiarity with such
operations, staff development at the mine presented problems contributing
substantially to the Project's delay (para. 3.15). This can be explained
by the lack of a sufficient technological base in the Company and by the
inadequacy of staff recruitment and training programs.
4.17      When the relations between CPG and the PM assistance firm
deteriorated, CPG staff along with various suppliers became more intimately
involved with commissioning and start-up. This provided valuable training
for CPG personnel in operating the plant, however, was not sufficient for
the mine. The mine experience should have been buttressed by the
involvement of an experienced consultant along with a detailed training
program gradually letting the Company increase its know-how and
self-sufficiency in managing a longwall operation.
Market Development and Performance
4.18      With its present annual production of 0.8 mtpy (in 1981) compared
to the Company's total of 5.0 million tonnes of saleable product, the Sehib
plant contributes only 16% to CPG production. The market impact of the
plant can be made quite significant if the capacity utilization can be
increased from its present level of 50%.
4.19      The quality of the product produced by the Sehib plant is 65/68Z
BPL. This compares the same with most of the rest of CPG's production and
with 70-75Z BPL offered by other major rock exporters (Morocco, the USA).

4.20      The exports of Tunisian phosphate rock at the present time and at
time of appraisal are summarized in Table 17. A shift towards domestic
processing can be observed. Tunisian rock exports in 1974 constituted 5%
of world phosphate rock trade. In 1981 this share was 3%.

Financial/Economic Viability
4.21      The Project's financial and economic rates of return are 2.4% and
10.2% respectively. These rates assume that the Sehib plant will reach
100% of its output capacity by 1985 through feed rock by nearby mines and
that phosphate rock prices will increase in real terms by 3% per annum from
1983 onwards. The Project, while unviable, has taught lessons which are
assets that may help CPG improve operations though proper technical
assistance.
V.   COMPANY PRODUCTION PERFORMANCE
Mining
5.01      The extraction activities between 1975 and 1981 are charactperized
by an increase in mechanization. The evolution of tonnage extracted by
different methods is shown on Table 18.

5.03       The reasons for the poor extraction performance observed above
are cited as follows:
(a) Undertaking of certain projects without any techno-economic
studies resulting in costly modifications and improvisations
later on.
(b) Undertaking of certain projects based on studies made for
other locations without taking into account the new
constraints and particularities.
(c) Absence of standards of performance, improvisions in
measurement of output and performance, lack of a compensation
scheme with incentives for high performance.
Cd) Delays in the implementation of planned investments for
extraction activities (DT 22.5 million instead of DT 32.9
million foreseen for the period 1975-79, i.e., 68 percent
realization).
(e) Spare part shortages due to insufficient internal planning
and follow-up.
(f) Absence of preventive maintenance and an unsystematic
maintenance approach unsuitable to the requirements of modern
equipment.
(g) Usage of certain equipment that was either unsuitable or too
fragile for the conditions under which utilized or requiring
long trial periods.
(h) Insufficiency in training for new methods.
(i) Inadaptability of foreman to the new mechnanized operations
resulting in an inability to install the coordination needed
in mechanized operations, to properly direct maintenance
services and conseauently to maintain authority amongst
workers.
(j) Wastefulness and absenteeism amongst workers.



- 28 -
(k) Lack of experienced technical staff and a high reliance on
young inexperienced engineers.
(1) Reluctance to use outside project management or technical
assistance.
5.04      In 1980, total extraction reached 7.8 million tonnes of which 1.7
million tonnes were obtained through subcontracting.  Thus, the extraction
realized by the Company itself in 1980 reached 6.1 million tonnes compared
to the 4.8 million tonnes in 1979. This was a major jump in extraction.
The unit extraction cost (after depreciation but before company overhead
and transportation beyond mine) in 1980 for all extraction operations were
DT 3.346/tonne and excluding subcontracting DT 3.646/tonne comparing quite
favorably with the DT 3.834/tonne and DT 4.509/tonne of 1979 respectively.
5.05      The clear improvement in 1980 unit extraction costs was due to
the start-up of Company operations in the new Kef Eschfaier open pit mine.
Apart from subcontracting, CPG's own extraction activity in this mine was
1,279 thousand tonnes in 1980 compared to the 357 thousand tonnes that the
Company extracted itself in 1979. CPG's unit extraction cost registered
for Kef Eschfaier in 1980 was DT 1.665/tonne compared to the DT 4.543/tonne
in 1979.
5.06      The situation improved even more in 1981.  Total extraction has
increased to 8.5 million tonnes of which 6.8 were extracted by CPG itself.
CPG extraction from Kef Eschfaier increased to 2.4 million tonnes from 1.3
million in 1980. Sehib production reached 0.5 million tonnes compared to
0.4 million in 1980. The unit extraction costs were available only in
standard cost units at time of completion mission.
Beneficiation
5.07      The plant production of beneficiated marketable rock between 1975
and 1981 is characterized by:
(a) an increase in the output capacity of plants and a consequent
increase in coarse rock demand;
(b) an inadequacy in coarse rock supplies;
(c) an increase in the unit beneficiation costs;
5.08      Beneficiated marketable rock production has increased gradually
between 1975 and 1981 (106 tons):
1975    1976     1977    1978      1979      1980     1981

- 29 -
5.09      The output capacities of plants have increased from 3.8 million
tpy in 1973 to 7.7 million tpy in 1981. The corresponding increase in the
rock demand, however, was not matched by the supply (106 tpy):

5.10      The unit beneficiation costs (plant only) in the 1975-1981

5.11      The reasons for the poor production performance observed above
can be cited as follows:
(a) insufficient coarse rock supplies causing not only
underutilization of capacity but also a drop in yields (due
to the continuous need to monitor operating parameters
according to quantity and heterogeneity of rock fed), water
wastage and stoppages;
(b) water shortages;
(c) inadequate qualitative and quantitative control of mineral
flow resulting in suboptimal modes of operation;



- 30 -
(d) lack of experience of responsible plant personnel and
inadequate training;
(e) increase in fuel costs from DT 0.180/tonne of marketable rock
in 1975 to DT 0.854/tonne in 1981 (47%).

observations from these statements are as follows:
(a) Net losses were incurred between 1977 and 1980 (Annex IIIa).
Shortages of coarse rock supplies to feed existing plant
capacities (Table 19), high unit production costs, depresssed
market prices and increasing financial charges have caused
such losses.
(b) The major sources of funds have been long term debt with the
major application being the increase of fixed assets between
1975 and 1981 (Annex IIIb). The ambitious investment plans
have not provided an adequate relief to coarse rock supply
shortages while they have deteriorated the Company's
financial balance. The debt:equity ratio has reached as high
as 68:32 in 1980. (Table 10).
,c) The working capital has deteriorated and has been negative
since 1978. Thus the liquidity ratio has been between 0.8
and 0.9 since. (Table 20).
(d) All operating ratios have deteriorated since 1975 until 1979.
(e) Some improvement Was observed in 1980; and In 1981 for the
first time since 1976 the Company registered a net benefit.

Financial Covenants
6.02      CPG's debt:equity ratio has been above 55:45 since 1979 contrary
to the Loan Agreement section 5.05.
6.03      CPG's liquidity ratio has been well below 1.3 since 1977 contrary
to the Loan Agreement section 5.06.
6.04      CPG has in the past engaged in investments exceeding US$5.0
million per year contrary to the Loan Agreement section 5.10. The highly
leveraged investments not only have put claims on Company financial
resources when servicing such debt was due but also created a dispersion of
human resources into too many project activities.
6.05      Observance of the Bank's reporting requirements as indicated in
the Loan Agreement section 5.02 has not been systematic. CPG has
cooperated in providing data and information requested in the past.
However, reports have often been submitted late. This has been not because
CPG was unwilling to disclose timely information but mostly because a
systematic reporting system is still lacking within CPG.
6.06      The Bank's letter of June 1978 threatening suspension of Loan
activated some remedial actions at Project level but little changed on
Company wide concerns such as the financial ratios, planning, cost control,
etc.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
Overall Assessment
7.01      The ProJect's immediate objective was to improve CPG's production
capacity in volume and unit cost by mastering a modern, efficlent mining
method and beneficiation. A longer term objective was to adapt the
longwall particularly on the so-called Eastern Sector deposits which need
an efficient underground method for exploitation. The planned expansion of
production and reduction of unit costs have not been achieved mainly due to
lengthy trials of technical feasibility, organizational imnd logistic
deficiencies of CPG. The longwall method, while finally operating as trial
face, underlined the requirement for consistent organiza 4onal and logistic
support to demonstrate economic/financial viability. CPG was unwilling to
hire such support and unable to organize these resources in-house. As the
existence of more viable surface mining prospects were confirmed in 1976-78
the urgency of pursuing the Project also declined in relative and absolute
terms. A washing plant was built as part of the Project but is utilized at
only half of its capacity through improvised mining operations of limited
life span due to lack of water and raw rock supplies. The Project has been
a failure for both the Bank and CPG.
7.02      The problems encountered were conceptual, technical and
managerial relating to:



-32-
(a) the underestimation in the feasibility study of the problems
involved in technical trials, project management and
technology transfer, given CPG lack of prior experience in
project management;
(b) the failure of a timely development of the longwall method at
the Sehib mine to provide sufficient quantities of ore to
supply the beneficiation plant;
(c) the lack of overall planning in the Modernization Program.
7.03      The Project was ill conceived.  Including the Bank, CPG and the
consultants, all involved parties failed in structuring the project
properly. Results from trial mines were extrapolated for a 2.0 million
tonnes per year operation. Project management during implementation was
never properly structured leading to excessive delays In installation,
trial runs and trial evaluation.  Company organizational and logistic
resources were not developed in parallel to support and assimilate the
technology of longwall which was new to the labor intens±ve Company and
relatively new to the phosphate mining industry. Longwall mining meant
technology transfer of a highly mechanized nature requiring well
established organizational practices such as labor continuity, preventive
maintenance practices, adaptability to mechanized operatlons, team work and
last but noc least access to spare parts on short notice. While CPG needed
to establish an acceptable underground method to employ in the long run,
none of these logistic prerequisites were in place and taken seriously by
the Company.
7.04      From a technical standpoint the failure of the Project is due to
the failure of the Sehib mine to deliver the planned output. Like other
underground mining projects, there were unforeseen rock mechanical factors
which caused a great deal of the delays and cost overruns. The Sehib
longwall trials undertaken with outside management during 1980 achieved
some encouraging levels of production which were further replicated by
CPG. However, the success was sporadic and did not constitute a continuity
of good performance, required for this capital  intensive extraction
method. It thus failed to restore confidence on the viability of the
longwall method within CPG's present organizational set up. Also, CPG
believes that, even with the production levels reached in 1980, the project
is uneconomic under today's economic conditions.
7.05      A major problem having adverse effects on the Company's
operations in the past has been lack of overall planning and cost control.
During the 70's CPG expanded the scope of its modernization and expansion
program and committed itself to a large number of investments. The
extraction activities between 1975 and 1979 were characterized by an
increase in mechanization, a constancy in the tonnages extracted (excluding
subcontracting) and an increase in unit extraction costs. An improvement
in 1980 was observed on tonnages extracted and the overall unit extraction
costs due to the opening of the Kef Eschfair open pit mine. The plant



-33-
production activities in the above period were characterized by an increase
in the Company's plant output capacity with a consequent increase in coarse
rock demand, an inadequacy in coarse rock supplies and an increase in unit
beneficiation costs. The necessary basic economic and financial analysis
of the various investments were not properly undertaken. New washing
plants were built without a careful assessment of the output obtainable
from various mining operations to feed the overall beneficiation capacity
of the Company. The scattering of washing plants over a 50 km wide mining
area created costly and complex ore transport problems when the nearby mine
failed to supply the ore needed. The absence of performance standards,
inaccuracies in production measurements and lack of systematic cost control
has resulted in an inability to properly detect problem areas and define
priorities in planning.
Lessons for the Borrower and the Bank for Similar Projects
7.06      In retrospect, the timing of the technology transfer was poor.
It had to come after an upgrading of CPG's organizational resources (cost
control, planning, maintenance, etc) and after an optimization was
undertaken to delineate strategic scheduling in investments by priority
(modernization of existing operations, rationalization of mine and plant
relationships, development of open pit mines). In light of the experiences
with the Sehib project, the following major lessons are drawn for lowering
the risk and improving the benefits of similar projects:
(a) Technical:  Underground mining, particularly if mechanized,
presents specific risks related to rock behaviour, difficult
working environment, absenteeism, turnover of personnel and
long learning curve. Before defining and embarking on an
underground mining project, all alternative possibilities of
open pit mining should be carefully evaluated. The choice of
mining method must be based on fully conclusive and
successful trial operations, prior to loan processing.
(b) Managerial: The Project demonstrates the difficulty of
striking the correct balance between project management and
operation responsibilities. CPG took on full project
management responsibility with only occasional consultant
input for the mine to ensure -learning by doing- and
immediate technology transfer. However, they could not
demonstrate viable operation of the system.   The
results could have been avoided if the Project had been set
up with a project management, operational assistance and
training program which fully reflected CPG's strengths and
weaknesses.

In comparing the Income Statements with the Balance Sheets,
the entries on inventories and depreciation show discrepancies. This
is due to reevaluation of inventories, rehabilitation of previously
depreciated assets, retirement of assets and adjustments on deprecia-
tion for prior periods. Such discrepancies are lumped by CPG under
the entries Prior Period Adjustments and/or Extraordinary Items for the
Income Stltement. The following tables are provided to reconcile the
discrepancies on these entries between the Income Statements (I.S) and
the Balance Sheets (B.S). (Figures may not add due to round cff error):
