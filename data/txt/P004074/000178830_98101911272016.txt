KOREA
APPRAISAL OF
KOREA DEVELOPMENT BANK
SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
(i)       This report recommends a loan of $82.5 million to Korea Development
Bank (KDB). As a special feature of this loan, US$7.5 million will be ear-
marked for onlending to the Korea Industrial Leasing Company (KILC), a
subsidiary of KDB.
(ii)      KDB is the largest institution in Korea providing term capital.  In
1975 KDB financed 7% of total fixed capital formation in Korea and was in-
volved in 34% of total fixed investment in the country. It accounts for 43%
of all medium- and long-term loans outstanding in the banking sector. Its
guarantee portfolio accounts for 38% of Korea's total foreign term debt.
(iii)     KDB's appraisal standards are high and its reports usually reflect
thorough competent appraisal work. At the time of the first loan, the Bank
asked KDB to start doing economic rate of return analysis for at least some
projects; the scope of economic rate of return analysis will be considerably
enlarged in the future. KDB will also include explicitly in its appraisal
reports a treatment of the employment impact of its investments. KDB's
supervision procedures are well developed and systematic. Its procurement
and disbursement procedures are also satisfactory.
(iv)      KDB's present Governor has been in office for 4 years; he provides
effective leadership. All Executive Directors have been promoted from within
and have served KDB for many years. KDB's staff is professionally highly com-
petent and efficient.
(v)       KDB's loan commitments increased to W 203 billion in 1975 from
W 153.2 billion in 1974. Equity investments were abnormally high because the
Government transferred W 50 billion in shares to KDB as capital in kind.
During negotiations the Government has given an undertaking that, in future,
equity increases would normally be made by way of cash contributions or loan
conversions.  Adequate safeguards have been provided that in the exceptional
case of increase in equity in the form of transfer of shares, there would be
no overvaluation. Guarantees issued by KDB declined to W 551 billion in 1975
from W 700 billion in 1974; the majority of these were covered under the
Guarantee Release Arrangement made at the time of the first Bank loan.
(vi)      KDB's resource position was tight in 1975 because of its inability
to raise needed funds in international capital markets which were badly af-
fected by the world recession. The resource position has improved in 1976.
Equity capital remains KDB's single largest source of funds, accounting for 30%
of total resources.



- ii -
(vii)     KDB has very low arrears.  To a certain extent, the level of arrears
was affected by the high incidence of justified reschedulings during 1975.
However, KDB's portfolio remains sound even after taking into account all the
reschedulings.
(viii)    Because of large reschedulings in 1975, payment of a large part of
new capital by the government in the form of shares in various companies and
KDB's inability to raise as much in long-term funds as it had planned, KDB's
liquidity position was tight in 1975. It has taken steps to avoid a similar
situation in the future. KDB will also endeavor to reduce the proportion of
2-3 year Industrial Finance Debentures in its total resources. KDB's liquidity
position has already improved in 1976. KDB's operational profitability has
improved in the last two years although the return on equity remains modest.
(ix)      KDB's operational projections show that its commitments in 1976-78
would amount to W 876 billion. It plans to raise a total of W 987 billion dur-
ing this period, including two loans amounting to $180 million from the World
Bank. The proposed loan will help KDB meet a part of its resource require-
ments.
(x)       Financial projections show that KDB's financial position should re-
main satisfactory with improving liquidity and reasonable debt service and
interest coverages. Its profitability will remain modest but, for a state-
owned institution, satisfactory.
(xi)      The proposed loan will have two components: $75 million for the
main operations of KDB and $7.5 million for its subsidiary, the Korea Indus-
trial Leasing Company, Ltd (KILC). The KILC component will be used for pro-
jects meeting specific eligibility criteria. It is proposd to have a fixed
maturity of 15 years for the KILC component and to allow KILC reimbursement
of the foreign exchange component of local procurement of machinery, estimated
at 60%.
(xii)     No change is recommended in the 5:1 debt/equity ratio.  The free
limit is proposed to be increased to $1.5 million; the Bank could expect to
receive projects for prior approval accounting for 70% of the proposed loan
amount. To encourage the diversification of KDB's overall portfolio and
specifically the diversification of KDB's on-lending of Bank funds, KDB
should not lend more than 20 to 25 percent of the proposed loan to any one
sector other than manufacturing. Within the manufacturing sector, the 20 to
25 percent limitation would apply to individual industries. The size of a
single sub-loan should not normally exceed $5 million.
(xiii)    During negotiations for the proposed loan, understandings were
reached with KDB (recorded in agreed minutes) on the following:
(a) KDB's appraisal reports, in the future, will deal
explicitly with the aspects of the choice of technology
and more labor intensive production processes so as to



- iii -
indicate that due weight was given to the employment
effects of the subprojects. Also KDB will enlarge
the scope of the economic rate of return analysis
(paragraphs 2.13 and 2.14).
(b)  In the interest of the diversification of KDB's overall
portfolio and specifically for the diversification of
KDB's on-lending of IBRD funds, KDB will not lend more
than 20 to 25 percent of the proposed loan to any one
sector other than manufacturing; within the manufacturing
sector, the 20-25 percent limitation will apply to
individual industries. KDB will also use $5 million
o- the proposed loan for the domestic construction
industry in view of the potential this industry possesses
for job creation (paragraph 6.15).
(c)  Lending from the KILC portion of the proposed loan will
normally be limited to enterprises with total assets of
up to W 600 million or projects with estimated cost of
up to US$15,000 equivalent per new job (paragraph 6.14).
(d)  An arrangement between the Government and KDB, whereby
the Gove.nmeat would in effect assume the risks on projects
which KDB finances acting as an agent only (paragraph 2.19).
(e)  An understanding by the Government to normally increase
KDB's capital through cash contributions or loan con-
versions. If under exceptional circumstances subscrip-
tions by the Government to KDB's capital would be made
by way of share transfer, the transfer price of such
shares would not be lower than their appraised value
(paragraph 3.22).
(f)  A phasing out schedule of the cases which exceeded the
new financial prud&~--e limits set in KDB's Policy Statement
of April 9, 1975 ( -ragraph 2.10).
(g)  KDB would make an accont-by-account analysis, in collabor-
ation with Its external auditors, to determine the appro-
priate provisions during the course of audit of its 1976
accounts and that such provisions would be properly
treated in its balance sheet (paragraph 4.14).
(h) KDB would make every effort to lessen the importance
of short-term IFD's in its total resources.

APPRAISAL OF
KOREA DEVELOPMENT BANK
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The first Bank loan of $60 million to KDB was signed in March 1975
and became effective in June 1975. KDB's utilization of the loan has been
very satisfactory. As of September 30, 1976, $59.1 million had been authorized
and $39.0 million had been disbursed, ahead of the original estimates.
1.02      This report, based on an appraisal carried out in April 1976, re-
commends a loan of $82.5 million. The main objectives of the proposed loan
are transfer of resources and their efficient allocation, mainly in the
manufacturing sector, and to continue the Bank's "institution building role"
which began with the first loan.  An innovative feature is the earmarking of a
portion of the loan for KDB's subsidiary, the Korea Industrial Leasing Company,
Ltd., for small enterprises with specific project eligibility criteria.
1.03      The Bank's latest report on the Korean economy is "Current Economic
Position and Prospects of the Republic of Korea," dated May 26, 1975. A Basic
Economic Mission visited Korea In June-July 1976; its report is under prepa-
ration. Those aspects of the economic situation which have direct relevance
to KDB's operations are summarized in Annex 1.
II. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
Functions
2.01      Broad functions.  KDB was established in 1954 with the primary ob-
jective of the post-war rehabilitation of Korean industries and infrastructure.
KDB finances such sectors as electric power, coal mining, shipbuilding and
most industries in the manufacturing sector, both public and private. It
makes (a) long- and medium-term capital loans, (b) working capital loans to
enterprises financed under (a), (c) equity investments, and (d) it issues
guarantees in domestic and foreign currency. KDB is now the country's larg-
est term financing institution and it is currently planning to enter the
merchant banking business by establishing a subsidiary.
2.02      Government has consistently depended on KDB as a financing channel
for its development policies. In line with this objective the KDB Share-
holding Act was enacted in 1969 to enable KDB to act as a holding company
for such enterprises the shares of which are transferred to it by the Gov-
ernment. These holdings have declined in recent years, in line with Gov-
ernment s policy gradually to transfer ownership of public companies to the
private sector.



2.03      Share capital.  In December 1974, the KDB Act was amended to in-
crease KDB's authorized capital to W 300 million from its previous level of
of W 150 million. As of December 31, 1975 KDB's paid in capital stood at
W 203.2 billion.
Organization, Management and Staffing
2.04      KDB's organization is shown in Chart 1.  The Head Office has twenty-
two departments. These have been grouped according to broad functions, each
group reporting to one of the seven Executive Directors. Each department
is headed by a Director who reports to the Executive Director in charge.
The operational departments are responsible for processing applications
for loans, investments and guarantees and for all follow-up activities.
Supporting departments undertake technical and financial studies, research
and international transactions. Specialized departments are in charge of
operational planning and internal audit. Supporting departments include
Technical Services, Business Analysis, Research, Foreign Capital and
International Departments. General planning and control is entrusted
to the Planning, Business Control, Operation Development, Special Credit
Control and Audit Departments. The other departments are in charge of the
general administration and secretariat.
2.05      Branches and representative offices.  KDB has nine branches outside
Seoul; one in Ulsan and one in each of the major cities of the eight main-
land provinces. The organization of a typical branch is given in Chart 2.
The Head Office is responsible for all projects located in Seoul area, large
Government projects, and foreign currency financing; the branches identify
and appraise all projects located in their jurisdiction. Apart from small
working capital loans which can be approved by the branches within certain
limits, 1/ the project appraisal is normally forwarded to the Head Office
for approval. KDB also has representative offices abroad which are mainly
in charge of investment promotion and fund raising. In addition to its
offices in New York and Tokyo which were established earlier, KDB opened
two more offices during 1975, in London and Kuwait.
2.06      Management.  KDB is managed by a full-time Board of Executive
Directors composed of the Governor, the Deputy Governor and seven Executive
Directors. The Governor is appointed by the President of the Republic upon
recommendation by the Minister of Finance while the Deputy Governor and Exec-
utive Directors are appointed by the Minister of Finance upon recommendation
by the Governor. The term of office of all Board members is 3 years, and is
renewable. Brief particulars of KDB's Board members are summarized in Annex 2.
1/   W 30 to W 110 million depending on the branch.

2.07      The present Governor of KDB, Mr. Woun Gie Kim was reappointed in
1975 and has now held office for 4 years. Most of his previous career was
spent dealing with fiscal and monetary matters in the Ministry of Finance
of which he was the Vice Minister. The Deputy Governor, Mr. Choon Taik
Chung is new to KDB having been appointed in May, 1976. All the present
Executive Directors have spent their entire career in KDB and its predecessor,
the Industrial Bank of Korea. All members of the Board are well qualified and
experienced. The Governor is well respected in financial and business circles
and in the Government. KDB is a competently managed institution; the Governor
provides effective leadership.
2.08      Staff.  A breakdown of KDB's staffing position by departments as of
March 31, 1976 is shown in Annex 3. As of that date KDB's total staff num-
bered 1,698 of whom 556 should be considered as "professionals". About a
fifth of the total staff is assigned to provincial branches or representative
offices. KDB's total staff has remained at approximately the same strength
over the last five years. Staff turnover has been increasing with the grad-
ual erosion of KDB's comparative salary advantage especially in comparison
with private industry. Although KDB's management is aware of this problem,
its ability to strengthen KDB's remunerative competitiveness is hampered by
Government regulations, and there is a possibility that annual staff turnover
of 5% -10% may become a normal feature. While this will be high by KDB's
historical record, KDB can afford it without loss of efficiency. Professional
staff is recruited through competitive examinations from graduates of both
college and high school. Most all the present senior staff started their
career with KDB. Seniority and performance are the main considerations in
staff promotion.
2.09      KDB provides regular professional training to its employees.  In
1975 a total of over 1,500 persons from clerks to department directors took
part in various training courses of 2 days to 4 weeks. In addition, 24
professionals were sent abroad for training in various private or multina-
tional organizations in 1975. KDB has a systematic and efficient training
and career development program for its staff.
Operational Policies
2.10      KDB's operations are governed by the KDB Act and its Enforcement
Decree, KDB's By-laws, Operating Manuals and a Policy Statement, given in
Annex 4, amendments to which are subject to the Bank's agreement. The Policy
Statement provides for the usual financial prudence limits, among other matters.
As of June 30, 1976, KDB had exceeded various limits in 12 cases, but 11 of
those were already in KDB's portfolio when the new Policy Statement was adopt-
ed. However, additional financial assistance has since been granted by KDB
to 7 of them. On the basis that exceptional cases should be normalized over
a period of time, the Bank discussed during negotiation, and found acceptable,
a plan prepared by KDB to phase out those old cases. During the first half
of 1976, KDB was already able to dispose of two of such earlier cases.



-4-
Procedures
2.11      Appraisal.  Procedures are practically identical in the case of
loans, guarantees and equity investments. All applications go through a
preliminary screening either at the branch or head office before a full ap-
praisal is undertaken. After appraisal of the project, a final recommen-
dation is made by the Loan Officer to the Board of Directors or to the Loan
Review Committee, which comprises the Deputy Governor, the Executive Director
in charge of the Business Control Department and the Executive Director in
charge of the department which conducted the project appraisal. The Loan
Review Committee considers domestic currency loans and guarantees amounting
to less than W 50 million each and subprojects designated by Government
amounting to less than W 200 million each. Guarantees in foreign currency 1/
are processed by the Foreign Guarantee Department and foreign currency loans
by the Foreign Loan Department. Equity investments are appraised by the
Shareholding Department if KDB participation is to exceed 50%, otherwise by
the Investment and Securities Department. While general responsibility for
preparing the appraisal report lies with the Loan Officer, he may, depending
on the complexity of the project, request a technical feasibility analysis
from the Technical Services Department or a detailed financial analysis from
the Business Analysis Department. Consultations with these two departments
are usually waived when the company was appraised by the Business Analysis
Department within the preceding 12 months or a credit research was carried out
within the preceding 6 months. The Loan Officer must also contact the Korea
Appraisal Board to obtain an independent evaluation of the collateral.
2.12      KDB's appraisals are usually thorough and systematic.  The quality
of appraisals reviewed by the Bank under the First Loan has been consistently
good. An ex-post analysis of project costs carried out by KDB in 1975 on a
sample of projects showed a very satisfactory estimation of capital costs in
the original appraisals. For some very large priority projects referred to
KDB by the Government, its role is confined to acting as a channel. KDB's
input in formulation and appraisal of such projects is small, being limited
to checking and supplementing the evaluation work done by the ministries con-
cerned.
2.13      Under the First Bank Loan, KDB undertook to calculate the Economic
Rate of Return (ERR) for all projects with subloans of US$750,000 or more
financed from the loan. After KDB had gained sufficient experience and found
the ERR calculation a useful analytical tool, it recently expanded the
applicability of the ERR analysis to all foreign currency loans exceeding
US$750,000 irrespective of the source of financing. It will henceforth also
include this analysis in its appraisals of all domestic currency loans ex-
ceeding W 2 billion (US$4 million) for which it takes the financial risks
(see para 2.19).
1/   Subject to prior approval by the Foreign Capital Inducement Deliberation
Committee of the Economic Planning Board.



- 5 -
2.14      In accordance with the Government's economic policies, KDB has been
giving primary emphasis to those sectors which contribute to improving Korea's
balance of payments and to heavy and chemicals industries. Although KDB
does a competent job of project appraisal, it will, at the suggestion of the
Bank, give more emphasis in its appraisals of sub-projects to the employment
creation aspects. Its appraisal reports on projects to be financed from the
proposed Bank loan will deal explicitly with the aspects of alternative tech-
nologies and more labor intensive production processes, so as to indicate
that due weight was given to their employment effect. KDB has the technical
capacity to analyze such aspects competently.
2.15      Follow-up.  KDB's follow-up procedure is laid down systematically
in its operating manuals. Supervision guidelines and reporting requirements
are complete and thorough. Supervision is the responsibility of the Loan
Officers, in addition to their appraisal work. Following completion of a
project, all clients are requested to submit quarterly reports on their
operations and financial condition. Annual audited financial statements are
required in the case of all foreign currency loans and for domestic currency
loans exceeding W 100 million. On-the-spot inspections are selectively made
with field audits of the companies' books. Overdue loans or insufficiently
collateralized loans are transferred to the Special Loan Department. When
legal action is deemed necessary to recover overdues, the accounts are trans-
ferred for collection to the Readjustment Corporation. (See paragraph 4.11)
2.16      Procurement and Disbursement.  KDB's procurement policies and pro-
cedures are thorough and satisfactory. No formal competitive bidding is re-
quired by KDB for its domestic currency loans. The Technical Operations De-
partment (TOD), however, closely reviews the adequacy of the proposed machin-
ery as well as its estimated cost. Quotations from several suppliers are
normally requested. For foreign currency loans, KDB normally requires in-
ternational competitive bidding unless another procedure is justified on pro-
ject grounds.l/ KDB's bidding procedures are designed to ensure adequate pub-
licity for bid announcements. Evaluation of bids is performed by the TOD and
final selection of bids is made jointly with the subborrowers. It is KDB's
general policy to accept the lowest bid unless special reasons justify other-
wise. KDB has stated that it will inform the Bank with detailed justification
whenever, in respect of a project to be financed from the proposed Bank Loan
proceeds, procurement is not made on the basis of the lowest bid.
2.17      Regular Project Progress Reports are prepared by TOD as a basis
for allowing disbursements, ensuring that the borrower is fulfilling his
financial commitments and that withdrawals are being made for the agreed
1/   Of the 68 foreign currency loans extended by KDB during 1975 and first
half of 1976, including Bank sub-projects, there were 14 cases where
ICB requirement was waived. Most of these 14 loans were for financing
of second-hand ships where ICB would not be appropriate.

purposes. For loans in foreign currency, KDB follows the procedures laid
down by the lending institutions. At the end of the construction period, a
final Completion Report is issued by TOD.
Relations with Government
2.18      KDB's Autonomy.  The Government is the sole shareholder of KDB, and
as already noted, appoints its Governor, the Deputy Governor, the Executive
Directors and the internal Auditor.  The Minister of Finance exercises direct
supervision over KDB through approval of the Annual Operational Program (see
the following paragraph), audit of KDB's budget and financial accounts, and
examination of the various periodic reports submitted by KDB. The By-laws and
Operating Manuals of KDB and any revisions thereof are subject to the approval
of the Minister of Finance. KDB is also subject to the control of the National
Assembly, the Monetary Board and the Board of Audit and Inspection. Its prof-
its are exempt from income tax and the Government is obliged under Article 44
of the KDB Act to compensate KDB's eventual loss. Government may further
authorize KDB to engage in new activities or in the financing of new sectors
by modifying the KDB Act and its Enforcement Decree.
2.19      KDB has full autonomy in decisions on projects financed from resour-
ces raised independently of the Government, including funds from international
institutions. However, funds provided by the Government are usually earmarked
for certain sectors or, in the case of large priority industries, for specific
projects. KDB has financed and will continue to finance projects in the
selection and formulation of which it could not realistically be expected to
have any meaningful role. Such cases include Korea Electric Company (KECO),
Korea National Railways, Korea Highway Corporation, etc. The large exposure
of KDB in KECO led the Bank to ask as a condition of its first Loan that an
agreement be signed between KDB and the Government whereby, in effect, the
risks were assumed by the Government. A similar agreement, satisfactory to
the Bank, has now been worked out between KDB and the Government which would
relieve KDB of the financial risks in respect of all projects recommended to
it by the Government and for which funds are specifically provided.
2.20      Operational Program.  KDB must prepare annually an Operational Pro-
gram (OP) for the next fiscal year for submission to the Minister of Finance.
The OP is basically a quarterly analysis of the projected uses and sources
of funds. It is prepared from information supplied by KDB's operating depart-
ments and by the various ministries which may propose specific projects to be
financed by KDB. On the resources side KDB outlines how it expects to raise
the necessary funds from the different sources (i.e. government budgetary
funds, IFDs, specialized funds and foreign sources). The OP is approved by
the Minister of Finance after consultation with the Monetary Board, the State
Council and the President; the forecast budgetary funding thereby becomes a
commitment by the Government.

III. OPERATIONS AND RESOURCES
Summary of Operations
3.01      All KDB' s operations fall into one or more of the following three
principal categories: (a) capital loans in foreign and domestic currency and
working capital loans in domestic currency; (b) investments in equity shares,
corporate and municipal bonds and debentures; and (c) guarantees in domestic
and foreign currencies. KDB's loan, investment and guarantee operations for
the past five years are shown in Annexes 5, 10 and 14 and are summarized below
(in billion Won):
1971     1972      1973      1974      1975

Lending Operations
3.02      Operational Trends.  The rising trend in KDB's lending operations 1/
is emphasized by the fact that disbursements for the latest five-year period,
W 645.3 billion (US$1.3 billion) account for 54% of KDB's cumulative
1;   Loan commitments in 1972 were exceptiorally large because of the
direct impact on KDB's operations of the economic, fiscal, and
nimnetary measures taken by the Goverlment in that year (emergency
decree of August 3. 1972).



- 8 -
disbursements since its establishment in 1954 (W 1,196 billion). Total loan
approvals reached W 204.2 billion (US$495 million) in 1975, a 49% increase
over 1974, and were more than three times larger than in 1971. Approvals of
working capital loans accounted for 19% of total approvals in 1975, about the
same proportion as in the previous two years. Total capital loans approved
by KDB in 1975 amounted to W 166.1 billion of which only W 21.9 billion or 13%
were in foreign currency against 21% in 1974, 11% in 1973, 10% in 1972 and 30%
in 1971. Rather than a change in the nature and composition of projects fi-
nanced by KDB, these variations reflect a change in the pattern of financing
of imports, as a sizeable share of domestic currency loans is also used for
the procurement of imported equipment and machinery. Loan commitments and
disbursements have kept pace with increasing approvals over the last five
years and amounted to W 203.1 billion and W 202.6 billion respectively in
1975. As of December 31, 1975 loans outstanding amounted to W 577.8 billion
(US$1.2 billion) representing 2,416 loans to 446 companies.
3.03      Analysis of KDB's Lending Operations.  Annexes 6,7, and 8 show a
detailed analysis of KDB's loan commitments for the years 1973 through 1975
and of outstanding loans as of December 31, 1975. Outstanding loans in
foreign currency accounted for 8.5% of KDB's outstanding portfolio at end
1975. The share of the private sector in KDB's loan commitments has margin-
ally decreased over the last 3 years from 45% to 42%. It accounted for 37.7%
of total outstanding portfolio as of December 31, 1975. In terms of number
of companies, the private sector is dominant with 93% of outstanding capital
loans and 91% of outstanding working capital loans. This reflects the dual
character of KDB's assistance to Korean enterprises: large loans to gov-
ernment industrial projects on the one hand and smaller loans to private
industry on the other hand. This is also in line with the overall industrial
structure in Korea where the Government has financed large projects with
long gestation periods and low initial profitability, but the private sector
is also encouraged and left free to play its role. The average size of loans
committed by KDB to public sector enterprises has marginally increased over the
last 3 years from W 500 million in 1973 to W 550 million in 1975. Conversely
there was a sizeable increase in the average size of loans to the private
sector from W 47 million to W 137 million in 1973 and 1975 respectively. At
the end of 1975, loans exceeding W 200 million (US$417,000) each, accounted
for 22% of the total number of loans but nearly 87% of the total outstanding
amount.
3.04      The average duration of capital loan commitments has increased from
8 to 8.4 years weighted by number of loans and from 8.6 years to 9.9 years
weighted by amounts, for the years 1973 and 1975 respectively. Outstanding
capital loans as of December 31, 1975 had a weighted average maturity of 8.2
years by number and 9.4 years by amount. KDB's working capital loans often
have maturities exceeding 1 or even 2 years. Of the working capital loans
outstanding at end 1975, amounting to W 62.4 billion, 54% had original matur-
ities exceeding 2 years, but 53% by number had original maturities of less
than 6 months. The weighted average maturity of outstanding working capital
loans at end 1975 was 11 months by number and 21 months by amount.



- 9 -
3.r5      The sectoral distribution of KDB's total outstanding loan port-
folio as of December 31, 1975 follows the pattern of previous years with
37% by amount for the manufacturing sector (33% of capital loans and 68% of
working capital loans). Within the manufacturing sector, basic metals indus-
tries account for 8.5% of outstanding loans, followed by transport equipment
(5.8%), petroleum and coal industries (4.4%) and textiles (4.2%). The prin-
cipal non-manufacturing sectors in KDB's portfolio are electricity (34.8%)
and transportation (13.4%).
3.06      The geographical distribution of KDB's lending operations follows
the general pattern of industrial locatLon in Korea. KDB, however, has made
some progress in financing projects in regioris other than the two main indus-
trial centers of Seoul and Busan. Compared with 50.3% of total amounts com-
mitted in 1973, Seoul and Busan regions absorbed 42.1% in 1975. In terms of
outstanding amounts, a similar reduction was achieved with 42.6% at end
December 1975 against 52.7% at end June 1974.
3.07      Loans Financed Under IBRD Loan No. 1095-KO.  As of September 30,
1976, 31 projects had been approved by IBRD for financing under Loan 1095-KO
for a total of US$59.1 million (net of cancellations). Total investment
in these projects would amount to US$245.1 million of which KDB would finance
a total of US$63.1 million or 26%. The 31 sub-projects are expected to
generate incremental export sales of US$99.8 million annually at full capac-
ity and to create additional employment for 7,594 persons at an average
capital investment of US$32,000 per new job.  KDB calculated economic and
financial rates of return for 14 projects. 1/ The economic rates of return
(ERR) ranged from 16% to 46% while the financial rates of return (FRR) ranged
from 14% to 48%. Details of subprojects financed under Loan 1095-KO are given
in Annex 9. The sectoral distribution of subprojects shows that shipping
companies were the main recipients, with 43% of the loan amount; metal
industries come next with 23% and machinery construction 18%.
Investment Operations
3.08      Annex 10 gives a s amary of KDB's investment operations, 1971-75.
The investment portfolio whih had increased at an average rate of 8% p.a.
over the four-year period 1971-74 increased by 91% in 1975, mainly on account
of large share transfers by the Government (see paragraph 3.23). The port-
folio at end 1975 consisted of (i) equity shares, W 131.6 billion (US$271 mil-
lion) or 91% and (ii) bonds and debentures, W 13.5 billion (US$28 million) or
9%.
3.09      Equity Investments.  The average increase in KDB's investment port-
folio was 9% p.a. over the four-year period 1971-74 but an unprecedented
volume of shares transferred from Government in 1975 caused almost a 100%
1/   For which KDB's financing exceeded US$750,000 the cutoff point agreed
with the Bank.

increase over 1974. Annex 11 gives a detailed analysis of KDB's equity in-
vestments for the years 1973-75 and of outstanding portfolio as of December 31,
1975. Twenty-one companies of the 33 in KDB's portfolio at end 1975 belonged
to the public sector and represented 83% of KDB's portfolio. Manufacturing
enterprises accounted for 36% by number and 57% by amount, with chemicals and
metal industries representing 14% and 30% respectively. The non-manufactur-
ing sector amounted to 43% with construction-related and service industries
taking the largest share.
3.10      KDB has acquired its equity portfolio through (a) direct cash sub-
scriptions, (b) conversion of loans into shares and, (c) transfer of shares
by the Government as a contribution to KDB's paid-in capital. The cumulative
acqusition by KDB over the years 1971-74 amounted to W 44.5 billion, of which
W 22.2 billion or 50% was through direct purchase, W 20.5 billion (46%)
through loan conversions and W 1.9 billion only (4%) by transfer of government
shares. In 1975 total acquisitions reached W 69.4 billion (56% more than total
acquisitions over the previous four years). Only W 14.5 billion (21%) was
through direct purchase, one loan conversion of W 4.9 billion accounted for
7% while the balance of W 50 billion (72%) was by transfer of shares.   The
consequences of large transfers of shares are discussed in paragraph 3.22.
3.11      Sales of Equity Investments.  Capital gains on sales of equity in-
vestments amounting to W 1.3 billion and W 1.6 billion were realized by KDB
in 1974 and 1975, which represented respectively 39% and 43% of the original
costs. In 1973, however, KDB experienced a net loss of W 2.6 billion.
Sales in 1974 represented shares in five companies, while shares in two com-
panies were sold in 1975. Three sales in 1974 and one in 1975 were on a
cash basis, the remaining being on a deferred payment basis with interest
at 12% p.a. on the unpaid balance, with maturities of 2 to 9 years.
3.12      Extent of Ownership.  KDB's investment in 6 companies exceeded 50%
of the share capital of the companies concerned, the limit normally imposed
on "DB's participations by its Policy Statement. These six companies account-
ed for 26% of KDB's portfolio. Two of these companies, the Readjustment
Corporation (RAC) and Korea Industrial Leasin-, Company (KIT-) are permanent
subsidiaries of KDB and are ill ^ffect  3i:porate extensions  f KDB's opera-
tions. Details of these two companies appear in Annexes 12 and 13. Of the
four other companies, three were already in KDB's portfolio when the present
Policy Statement was adopted by KDB and no increase in KDB's participation has
been made since. KDB's holding in the fourth company amounted to 52.8% of
the company's share capital as of December 31, 1975, up from 31.7% at end
1974. KDB's acquisition of shares in this company during 1975 totalled W 9.4
billion consisting of W 6.1 billion in shares transferred by the Government
and W 3.3 billion of direct purchase from a cash contribution to KDB's paid-in
capital especially earmarked for that purpose. 1/
1/   KDB duly informed the Bank that an exception was being made to the
Policy Statement guideline in view of the favorable prospects shown
by the company and of government policy to sell part of its holdings
to private interests.

3.13      KDB Shareholding Act and Share Administration Fund (SAF).  The KDB
Shareholding Act was enacted in 1969. Under its scope fall "KDB-invested en-
terprises" i.e. companies in which KDB holds more than 50% of the share capi-
tal. 1/ The Shareholding Act provides for the establishment of (i) a Share-
holding Administration Committee (SAC) which comprises nine members 2/ and
is in charge of the control and supervision of concerned enterprises and
(ii) the Shareholding Administration Fund (SAF) which is established within
KDB as an autonomous fund with separate accounting. The SAF receives its
resources through the sales of shares of enterprises under the SAF, and
dividends received. As of Decemebr 31, 1975 the SAF had made no new invest-
ments but had granted several loans for an outstanding amount of W 5.6 billion.
Of the 17 companies originally brought within the purview of the Shareholding
Act there were only four at end 1975. KDB's holding in the other companies
had either been totally liquidated or reduced to a minority position. The
KDB Shareholding Act has proved very effective in giving KDB close control
and supervision over the management and finances of the companies concerned
and in influencing government policies affecting them. Most companies have
shown considerable improvements in their operations thus enabling KDB to
reduce its exposure. It is expected that the SAF will be phased out in the
next few years.
3.14      Bonds and Debentures.  The average increase in the portfolio over
the past 5 years was 8.5% p.a. Municipal debentures, which accounted for 80%
of the portfolio in 1971 and had risen to 90% by 1975, are subscribed by KDB
at the behest of the Government. The usual interest rate is 7.5% p.a. with a
20 year maturity including 5 years grace. For subscription to corporate bonds,
KDB carries out a detailed appraisal. There were three companies in KDB's
portfolio of corporate bonds as of December 31, 1975. The interest rates
ranged form 10% to 12% and the maturities from 2 to 5 years.
Guarantee Operations
3.15      KDB started guarantee operations in domestic currency in 1961 and
in foreign currency in 1968. Since 1972 KDB has been issuing foreign currency
guarantees directly to foreign creditors and without government counter-
guarantee. KDB's guarantee operations for the years 1971 through 1975 appear
in Annex 14. The outstanding guarantee portfolio as of December 31, 1975

decree (see Annex 11).
2/   The Ministers of (i) Economic Planning Board, (ii) Finance, (iii) Agri-
culture abd Fishery, (iv) Commerce and Industry, (v) Construction,

- 12 -
stood at W 1,480 billion (US$3.1 billion), 2.6 times the size of KDB's out-
standing loan portfolio. The average growth in KDB's guarantee portfolio
over the last 4 years has been 10% p.a. The share of foreign currency
guarantees issued and outstanding since 1971 has remained steady at 93% to
98% of total guarantees. While there was an increase of 157% in 1974 over
the previous year, new guarantees dropped by nearly 80% in 1975. The large
increase recorded in 1974 was due to the issuance of guarantees by KDB for
four very large priority projects amounting to US$1.08 billion or 92% of the
total. KDB's income from guarantee fees represents a substantial part of
total income (W 7.3 billion in 1975 or 11%) although amounting to 0.5% only
of KDB's average guarantee portfolio for the last 3 years.
3.16      Analysis of KDB's Guarantee Operations.  Annex 15 provides an
analysis of guarantee commitments in 1973-75 and of KDB's outstanding port-
folio as of December 31, 1975. The private sector accounted for 40% of KDB's
outstanding portfolio at end 1975 but nearly 77% by number of companies. The
average size of guarantees outstanding to private companies was W 8.4 billion
against W 4.3 billion for public sector enterprises. Of the 90 companies in
KDB's guarantee portfolio as of December 31, 1975, the 10 companies with the
largest amounts of outstanding guarantees accounted for 77% of total portfolio.
Korea Electric Company (KECO) was by far the largest with W 316.8 billion
outstanding or 21% or KDB portfolio. 1/ The sectoral distribution of KDB's
portfolio at end 1975 shows 66% outstanding for manufacturing industries,
with petroleum, basic metals and transport equipment accounting for 23%, 19%
and 11% respectively. Of the 34% outstanding in the non-manufacturing sector,
electricity represented 22% (mainly for KECO) a sizeable reduction from 32% of
KDB's portfolio at end 1973. Outstanding guarantees exceeding W 2 billion
(US$4 million) still represented 90% of KDB's portfolio at end 1975 although
their share of commitments has declined in the last two years. The weighted
average duration of guarantees committed has come down from 10 years in 1973
to 6.7 years in 1975.
3.17      The Guarantee Release Arrangement.  Because of the excessive risks
associated with KDB's very large guarantee operations, 2/ the Bank proposed
a Guarantee Release Arrangement (GRA) between the Government and KDB when
the First Bank Loan was made to KDB. The Government and KDB accepted
that proposal. The GRA applies to all foreign currency guarantees issued
or to be issued to (i) enterprises owned or controlled by Government and
(ii) to priority enterprises as defined in the KDB Act. Under the GRA, Gov-
erment has undertaken to provide KDB with funds necessary to enable it to
meet its obligations on defaulting guarantees and should the defaulting com-
pany be unable to meet its obligations, to reimburse KDB for whatever payments
1/   KECO is also KDB's largest borrower with W 200.4 billion outstanding.
2/   KDB's outstanding guarantee portfolio at end 1975 was twice as large
as its loan and investment portfolio combined and represented 5.8
times KDB's equity.



- 13 -
it had to make. As of December 31, 1975, 78% of KDB's outstanding guarantee
portfolio was covered under GRA. So far there has been only one default on a
guarantee covered under GRA. However, it was not necessary for the Government
to step in and reimburse KDB because the company itself was able to clear its
arrears.
Interest Rates and Guarantee Fees
3.18      Interest Rates - Annex 1 (paragraphs 24 to 27) contains a general
discussion on interest rates in Korea; Annex 16 shows the prevailing interest
rates in Korea and those charged by KDB as of August 2, 1976. Interest rates
in Korea are controlled by the Government through the Monetary Board and
apply to all banking and financial institutions. KDB's interest rate struc-
ture is complex due to its many sources of funds and is further complicated
by a number of priority industries 1/ that the Government subsidizes with low
interest rates. Since August 2, 1976, when the Government raised the general
level of interest rates, the rates charged by KDB range from 13% to 18% for
working capital loans and from 6% to 19% for capital loans. Loans at the
lower end of the scale are extended for projects that are determined by the
Government as priority projects (such as loans to railroads, the electricity
sector or heavy and chemical industries). The higher interest rates are
charged on general loans financed from internal funds. KDB has recently
started to differentijte between prime clients and other clients for working
capital loans out of inL.ernal funds (17% for prime clients and 18% for others).
KDB now also applies different rates depending on the duration of the loans
with most domestic currency loans paying 1 or 2 percent per annum more for
loans with maturities exceeding three and eight years respectively. Loans
made from funds provided by international organizations are on-lent with a
2% spread above KDB's borrowing rate, and the foreign exchange risk is born
by the borrower. Funds raised from foreign commercial sources and revolving
funds (from KfW, AID, ADB) are on-lent in domestic currency at 12% per annum,
but the borrower carries the foreign exchange risk. This rate is reviewed
every quarter and is changed, when necessary, to reflect changes in KDB's
own borrowing rates. The penalty rate on all overdue loans is 25%. KDB re-
quires advance payment of intereqt on its working capital loans. The weighted
average interest rate charged by KDB on all loans outstanding in its portfolio
at the end of December 1975 was 9.4% per annum while it was 10.8% per annum
for all loans committed during 1975 thus reflecting the rise in KDB's overall
lending rate during 1975 before interest rates were further increased in
August 1976.
3.19      Guarantee fees charged by KDB range from 1% p.a. for domestic
currency repayment guarantees to 0.3% p.a. for foreign currency guarantees
issued to the Korea Exchange Bank with a counter guarantee from Government.
The bulk of KDB's guarantee operations are to foreign suppliers; KDB charges
1/   Priority Industries currently comprise (1) industri.es generating, trar.-
miitting and supplying electric power; (2) coal mining; (3) shipbuilding;
(4) iron and steel manufacturing; (5) manufacturers of semi-conductors
and communication equipment; (6) overseas freight lines; and (7) air
transportation.



- 14 -
a fee of 0.58% p.a. Of all guarantees committed by KDB in 1975, the weight-
ed average fee was 0.5%.
Resources
3.20      As of December 31, 1975 KDB had total resources of W 861.8 billion
(US$1.7 billion) of which W 43.3 billion were short-term resources, consist-
ing mainly of short-term deposits (W 41.9 billion). Of the total long-term
resources of W 818.5 billion, 85.7% (W 701.6 billion) were available for
domestic currency loans and 14.3% (W 116.9 billion) for foreign currency
loans. Resources for domestic currency loans amounting to W 49.4 billion
(6.2%) were raised in foreign currency. KDB's resource position as of De-
cember 31, 1975 is summarized in Annex 17. A detailed description of KDB's
long-term resources is given in Annex 18, with the table attached to that
Annex giving the main terms and conditions of borrowed funds.
3.21      As shown in Annex 17, KDB had total resources in domestic currency
of W 744.9 billion of which only 3% (W 18.8 billion) was available for further
commitment as of December 31, 1975. Since a major part of this was in the
form of short-term resources (W 13.5 billion) KDB's long-term resource posi-
tion was very tight. However, according to its operations program for 1976,
the Government has already committed to KDB W 57.8 billion from budgetary
funds and W 98.7 billion of the NIF. Borrowings abroad should also improve
the position. Of its total current resources of W 116.9 billion (US$241 mil-
lion) as of December 31, 1975, KDB had disbursed 41% (W 49.0 billion) and had
W 29.4 billion in undisbursed commitments, leaving W 38.5 billion for further
commitments.
3.22      KDB's equity is its largest single source of funds, accounting for
over 30% of the total resources. Thie authorized share capital is W 300 billion
of which W 203.2 billion had been paid in at the end of 1975.  Of this amount
W 79.8 billion had been paid in cash. W 47.5 billion in the form of loan con-
versions and W 75.9 billion in the form of Lransfer of shares. During 1975,
the Government's trar;fer of shares amoilntr- to W 50 bll-i-.  T  reL>-Ing
KDB's share capital Ln kind does not -rc ride r-- +unOs to  03.  ',Ince r
of the transferred shares are not traded, they cannot be teadily sold oy kUJD.
The problem is aggravated by the fact that, under existing laws, the shares
are transferred on the basis of the "higher of appraised or face value" and
in at least some cases, the transfer price was higher than the book/estimated
value of the shares. To safeguard against the transfer of overvalued shares
to KDB, the Bank sought and received a satisfactory undertaking from the
Government, that in future, equity subscriptions would normally be made
through cash contributions or loan coversion and that in the exceptional case
when subscription is made by share transfer, the price of such shares would
not exceed the appraised value.
3.23      During negotiations for the first Bank Loan, KDB's representatives
stated that KDB would curtail the issuance of short-term IFD's and in the
future would issue more long-term debentures, mainly abroad. During 1975 KDB



- 15 -
was unable to find buyers for such long-term IFD's and all the IFD's issued
(W 17.4 billion) were for two or three year maturities, the proceeds being used
for the redemption of previous short to medium term issues which had originally
been used to finance long-term loans. While the short-term debentures issued
helped KDB's liquidity position and made the low debt service cover less of
a problem, the fact remains that the use of such short-to medium-term funds
for long-term lending distorts KDB's financial structure. Moreover, the issu-
ance of these IFD's in the domestic market is costly for KDB, resulting in a
negative spread (see Annex 18, paragraph 12). KDB's management is aware of
this situation and has already taken a positive measure by limiting future
issuance of short-term domestic IFDs to amounts that would not exceed redemp-
tions of IFDs falling due. During negotiations, KDB's representatives also
stated that KDB would make every effort to lessen the importance of such IFDs
in its total resources.
3.24      KDB has also used its commercial borrowings abroad to make loans
in domestic currency and at December 31, 1975, funds thus utilized accounted
for 6.2% of total resources. During 1975, however, KDB was unable to raise
commercial funds abroad. In particular, plans to issue US$100 million of
long-term IFD's abroad had to be shelved because market conditions were un-
favorable.  Since the beginning of 1976, however, KDB has been successful in
issuing IFD's for US$15 million and US$10 million in Abu Dhabi and in raising
commercially a Eurodollar loan of US$80 million and a loan of M 5 billion
(US$17 million) from a Japanese Banking consortium.  KDB now uses the proceeds
of commercial borrowings abroad exclusively for onlending in domestic currency,
while borrowings from official sources, such as the World Bank and ADB, are
onlent in foreign currency.
3.25      Except for its borrowings from OECF and Ex-Im Bank, Japan, under
the IRF for which KDB takes limited exchange risk (see Annex 18, paragraph 8),
KDB does not assume the foreign exchange risk on its borrowings in foreign
currency but passes it on to its clients. Even the sub-loans which are dis-
bursed in Won currency (from foreign commercial borrowings and revolving
funds) carry the exchange risk through a "maintenance of value" clause. To
avoid the risk even for the short periods between collections of loans and
disbursements of new loans, KDB keeps compensating deposit balances in foreign
currencies.
IV.  FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND PORTFOLIO EVALUATION
Financial Position
4.01      KDB's summarized Balance Sheets as at the end of the years 1971
through 1975 are given in Annex 19. As of December 31, 1975, KDB's total
assets amounted to W 2,311 billion (US$4,765 million) including W 1,480 bil-
lion of outstanding guarantees. Over the four year period between 1971 and



- 16 -
1975 total assets have increased 3.2 times. Excluding guarantees, loan port-
folio accounts for 60% of the total assets; investment portfolio accounted
for 17% and current assets (including current maturities of term debt) for
18% of total assets.
4.02      Of the total assets as of December 3, 1975, 31% were financed by
equity and the balance by long- and short-term liabilities. Borrowings in
domestic currency (W 385.9 billion), accounted for 76% of total long-term debt,
though KDB has increased, during the past two years, its borrowings in for-
eign currency which as of December 31, 1975 stood at W 84.0 billion or 17% of
total long-term debt. Time deposits, at 7% of total long term debt, compared
to 25% at the end of 1971, are no longer an important item. As of December
31, 1975, KDB had financed 18% of its total assets through current liabilities
(including 10% current portion of term debt) which is about double the propor-
tion as at the end of 1971. This increase in current liabilities occurred
almost entirely during 1974 and 1975 when repayments of several government
loans (including NIF loans) started and short-term borrowings increased
sharply.
4.03      Liquidity Position.  KDB's liquidity position deteriorated during
1975 and by the end of the year the current ratio had dropped to 1.0. There
were three main reasons. First, KDB could not raise long-term commercial
funds from abroad, which it had planned at the level of close to W 50 billion,
because of the international capital market situation. Secondly, business
conditions in Korea deteriorated considerably during 1975 and as a result KDB
had to reschedule a number of loans (see paragraph 4.12). Thirdly, capital
contributions by the Government were largely in the form of transfer of shares
(see paragraph 3.23), while cash payments were earmarked for specific projects
and thus could not be used in reducing short-term liabilities. The liquidity
position has improved during 1976 as KDB has been able to raise new long-term
funds abroad (see paragraph 3.24) and collections have also improved. KDB's
current ratio improved to 1.4 as of June 30, 1976 as it was able to re-
duce current liabilities by over 30% during the first half of 1976. The
tight liquidity position at the end of 1975 prompted KDB to formulate a
number of policies that would improve its liquidity position and bring the
current ratio up to a target level of 1.5:1. The measures taken include KDB's
accelerated sale of shares held, more strict matching of maturities of assets
and liabilities, asking for prepayments whenever the financial capabilities
of the borrowers would justify it and an appeal to the Government to pay in
equity capital in the form of cash or conversion of Government loans rather
than by transfer of shares. Cash Flow Statements for the years 1971 through
1975 are given in Annex 20. Despite the rather tight liquidity position, the
debt service cover for 1975 remained satisfactory, being 1.25 times; the
shortfall in collections was compensated by the substantial increase in
KDB's net profits and because some of the loans rescheduled in 1975 were
funded from Government loans which subsequently were also rescheduled. KDB's
interest coverage improved to 1.73 times in 1975 from 1.53 in 1973 and 1.35
in 1974 which is attributable to KDB's higher interest income and profit.



- 17 -
4.04      Debt/Equity Ratio.  The KDB Act stipulates that at any time the
aggregate of outstanding amounts of IFD's and KDB's guarantees shall not
exceed ten times its net worth. As of December 31, 1975 KDB was well within
this limit (5.9 times). A long term debt/equity ratio 1/ limit of 5 to 1 is
included in the Loan Agreement for the First Bank Loan and as of December 31,
1975 KDB was well within that limit, the actual ratio being 3.3:1.
Operational Performance
4.05      KDB's summarized income statements of the years 1971-1975 are given
in Annex 21. Over the past five years KDB's profitability has been low, aver-
aging 1.3% of total assets or 3.3% of equity. However, the profitability has
improved significantly in the last two years. 1974 profits would have been
better but for a non-recurring W 3.1 billion loss due to the 20% devaluation
of the Won in December of that year. This loss occurred because KDB had con-
verted proceeds of its foreign currency borrowings into Won currency before
these funds were on-lent. Since then adequate measures had been taken to
prevent a recurrence of such losses. In 1975, KDB's margin was 2.2% on
average total assets and 6.9% on average equity. KDB's "spread" is now
positive, which was not always the case in the past, and is expected to re-
main positive in the future as KDB is fully aware of the Bank's insistence
on positive spreads. Although improved, KDB's profitability is still modest
and will continue to be so because the Government, the sole shareholder,
considers it essentially a developmental institution without a profit maxi-
mization function.
4.06      KDB's guarantee fee income has been an important source of profits,
especially since defaults in the past from its guarantees have been few in-
deed (see Annex 23). KDB's income including net realized capital gains
from its sizeable equity portfolio has been meager, averaging 3.5% of average
investment portfolio over the past five years. KDB's administrative expenses
increased 2.3 times over the past five years but decreased relative to total
assets from 1.5% in 1971 to 1.1% in 1975. KDB does not pay income taxes but
is required to pay a defense tax introduced in 1975, which for that year
represented about 9% of its net profits.
Audit
4.07      As is usual in Korea, KDB's books are audited by an internal
auditor, appointed by the shareholders, who is also a permanent member of
KDB's Board of Directors, though having no vote. Since 1972, KDB has its
accounts also audited by external auditors, who every year have given an un-
qualified report. For the audit of its 1975 accounts, KDB appointed, with the
concurrence of the Bank, a Korean auditing firm, San Kyong & Company. San
Kyong has prepared a thorough, "long form" audit report which is satis-
factory although, as explained in paragraph 4.14, it is proposed to suggest
a different treatment for provisions for doubtful debts.
1/   Debt as defined under this limit excludes guarantees covered under
the Guarantee Release Arrangement (see para 3.17).



- 18 -
Evaluation of Portfolio
4.08      Loan Portfolio.  An analysis of KDB's loan portfolio from the
point of view of the operating condition of client companies is contained
in Annex 22; arrears situation is analyzed in Annexes 23 and 24. Of the 446
companies in KDB's portfolio, 15 companies' projects were still under con-
struction as of December 31, 1975. Of the 431 companies in operation, 385
companies accounting for 81% of the total portfolio were operating profitably;
33 were operating at a loss but without facing serious difficulties; and 13
companies with outstanding loans of W 24.4 billion (4.4% of total portfolio)
were either facing serious problems or were temporarily closed down.
4.09      As of December 31, 1975 there were 44 companies which had arrears
of principal and/or interest; only 22 of them had arrears exceeding three
months. The number of companies in arrears has significantly declined over
the last three years from 92 companies at the end of 1972 to 44 at the end
of 1975. Total arrears as of December 31, 1975 amounted to only 0.2% of the
total outstanding loan portfolio. The principal amount outstanding of loans
in arrears amounted to W 16.4 billion or 2.8% of the total outstanding port-
folio. Arrears on working capital loans have always been higher than those
on the capital loans. KDB's collection performance has improved in recent
years; in 1975 it was able to collect 95% of the amount falling due and payable
during the year. The sectoral distribution of the arrears does not indicate
any particular industrial concentration.
4.10      Some of the companies in arrears of loans have also received guaran-
tees from KDB.  The total principal amount outstanding of loans and guarantees
to clients in arrears on their loan repayments amounted to W 33.9 billion or
1.6% of total outstanding loan and guarantee portfolio. The value of col-
lateral held by KDB in respect of these companies amounted to W 38.2 billion.
K1DB does not expect to incur any loss in respect of any of these companies.
4.11      The Readjustment Corporation (RAC).  When KDB has concluded that a
particular loan in arrears is irrecoverable, it is transferred by KDB to RAC.
The RAC was set up in 1962 as a wholly owned subsidiary of KDB in order to
exercise the claims of KDB and other banking institutions through foreclo-
sures and disposal of the acquired properties. (For a description of RAC and
its operations please see Annex 12.) During 1975, KDB transferred total
claims amounting to W 0.4 billion to RAC.  RAC settled outstanding KDB claims
for a total of W 1.1 billion during the year, of which it collected W 0.3 bil-
lion. The amount of uncollected settlements outstanding with RAC amounted to
W 9.9 billion as of December 31, 1975; total receivables from RAC amounted
to W 14.5 billion.
4.12      Reschedulings.  Because of the economic conditions during the year,
KDB's rescheduling of loans during 1975 was considerably and justifiably
higher than in the previous years as indicated by the following figures (in
million Won).



- 19 -
1971     1972      1973      1974     1975
Principal Amount Rescheduled  2,492    5,333   18,696   19,712   45,655
(of which due in the year)   (1,581)  (3,972) (16,963) (17,396) (29,143)
KDB contends that the significant increase in the amount rescheduled during
1975 did not indicate an easing of KDB's policy; it showed KDB's realism
in dealing with the difficult situation created by the worldwide trade slump.
Before any loan is rescheduled, KDB undertakes a complete reappraisal of the
project and a revised amortization scheduled is based on such a reappraisal.
4.13      To summarize, if the amounts actually in arrears, all loans resched-
uled, the one loan which was converted during 1975 into an equity investment,
and loans transferred to RAC for collection are all taken together, the total
principal amount affected would represent less than 14% of KDB's outstanding
loan portfolio as of December 31, 1975. KDB's loan portfolio continues to be
sound.
4.14      Provisions for Doubtful Debts.  KDB makes provisions for doubtful
loans on the basis of the historical record of amounts actually written off
during the previous five years. The provision is made by a charge to the
current income. However, the amount is shown in the balance sheet as a part
of the legal reserves and is therefore treated by KDB as a part of its equity.
Because the provision is not estimated on the basis of a company-by-company
analysis at any given point in time, it may be an underestimate. In addition,
the amount of the provision should not be treated as a part of the equity.
These suggested changes were accepted by KDB which gave an assurance that they
would be incorporated in the audit report on its 1976 accounts.
4.15      Guarantee Portfolio.  An analysis of the companies in KDB's guaran-
tee portfolio as of December 31, 1975 appears in Annex 22. There were, as
of that date, 116 companies in KDB's portfolio with outstanding guarantees
amounting to W 1,480 billion including 4 companies with outstanding claims
of W 481 million the liquidation of which had been entrusted to RAC. Eighty-
nine companies with outstanding guarantees of W 1,153 billion (80% of total
portfolio) were operating profitably. Ten were still in pre-operational
stages and 8 had suffered small losses. Five companies with outstanding
guarantees amounting to W 50.1 billion (3.4% of the total portfolio) were
facing serious difficulties or had closed down temporarily.
4.16      Of the guarantee portfolio comprising 116 companies, 4 were being
liquidated by RAC and 5 (4.3%) were in default. Total arrears amounted to
W 2,364 million (W 2,268 million of principal and W 96 million of overdue fees)
or 0.2% of the total portfolio, and portfolio affected had increased to 2.1%
as against 1.3% in 1974. Annexes 23 and 25 provide historical analyses of
the guarantee portfolio in arrears. Of the 5 guarantees in arrears as of
December 31, 1975, only one was a foreign currency guarantee, to a company



- 20 -
in the public sector; as such it is covered under the Guarantee Release
Arrangement (GRA) between KDB and the Government (see paragraph 3.18). The
other four guarantees in arrears were domestic currency guarantees made to
companies in the private sector. Outstanding guarantees affected amounted
to W 31,465 million. Furthermore, KDB had total loans of W 7,063 million out-
standing to these 5 companies. The total principal of loans and guarantees
affected by the 5 guarantees in arrears (W 38.5 billion) represented 1.9% of
the total outstanding portfolio of loans and guarantees. Against the total
principal of loans and guarantees affected by arrears, amounting to W 38,528
million to the five companies with overdue guarantees, KDB held collateral
valued at W 45,850 million. Of the 4 guarantees entrusted to RAC, for a total
of W 481 million, two accounts had been settled as of December 31, 1975
leaving an unsettled balance of W 242 million. KDB's guarantee portfolio
continues to be sound.
4.17      Equity Investment Portfolio.  As of December 31, 1975 KDB had equity
investments in 33 companies (see Annex 11). Of these, one was still in the pre-
operational stage, 22 were operating profitably and 11 were either operating at
a loss or confronting serious problems. While the operational performance of
the companies in KDB's investment portfolio is not quite as good as in the
case of its loan portfolio, this is essentially a reflection of KDB's basic
function in making equity investments. KDB's objective is (i) to assist com-
panies that have temporary management or operational problems but offer fav-
orable prospects in the long run, (ii) to promote companies that are finan-
cially not very attractive in the short run, but which have good long-term
prospects, and (iii) to dispose of its participations once such companies start
operating satisfactorily. Consistent with such a policy the dividend yield on
KDB's equity portfolio remains low but realized capital gains on sales of in-
vestments have improved the total yield. The total acquisition cost of KDB's
equity participations amounted to W 131.6 billion at end 1975 but was esti-
mated by external auditors to represent a value of W 169 billion on the basis
of either market value or book value. Overall, the quality of KDB's equity
investments is satisfactory.
Collateral
4.18      In terms of the provisions of its Policy Statement and Operating
Mianuals, KDB is required to obtain at least 125% collateral coverage against
its loans and 120% against its guarantees. However, such collateral require-
ments may be waived by KDB in the case of Government-owned enterprises,
KDB-owned and controlled enterprises or such priority enterprises as are
approved by the Board of Executive Directors. As of December 31, 1975, total
loans and guarantees outstanding to such enterprises amounted to W 1,731
billion (as against a total portfolio of W 2,058 billion) and collateral
pledged therefor was valued at W 755 billion. However, guarantees valued at
W 1,149 billion were covered under GRA (see paragraph 3.18), and KDB's assist-
ance to Korea Electric Company amounting to W 624.8 billion was also covered
under special agreement with the Government. Against the balance of W 327
billion in outstanding loans and guarantees, KDB held collateral valued at
W 415 billion, a 127% coverage. Collateral values are based on estimates made
independently by the Korea Appraisal Board. They are regularly updated and
are generally considered to be conservative estimates.

V. KDB's DEVELOPMENTAL ROLE
KDB in Perspective
5.01      KDB is by far the largest financial institution in Korea.  With an
outstanding loan balance of W 577.8 billion (US$1.2 billion) at the end of
1975, it accounted for 16% of total loans of all banking institutions in
Korea and almost 43% of all medium and long-term loans outstanding by the
banking sector. KDB directly financed 7% of total fixed capital formation
during 1975 and, including its guarantee operations, it helped in the finan-
cing of 34% of total fixed investment in the country. It is the principal
institution to provide long term capital to the power, transportation and
manufacturing sectors, accounting for almost 100%, 74% and 35% respectively
of all medium- and long-term advances by the banking sector. Its foreign
guarantee portfolio of US$3.0 billion accounts for 38% 1/ of Korea's total
foreign medium- and long-term debt at the end of 1975.
KDB's Role in the Government's Development Strategy
5.02      Within the framework of the Government's development strategy, KDB
plays an important role both by being an instrument of the Government to ex-
ecute its policies and by providing valuable input in the Government's deci-
sion making process.
5.03      KDB as an Executing Arm of the Government.  In terms of its Act,
KDB provides financing, in conformity with Government policies, to major in-
dustrial projects. KDB's support of Government policies is reflected in its
annual Operational Program which KDB formulates on the basis of its own demand
forecast and specific project proposals by various Government ministries.
This OP also contains the sources from which KDB would draw funds including
those provided directly by the Government through budgetary contributions and
the NIF. Hence, KDB is on the one hand a direct channel for the Government
to provide funds for specific priority projects, such as Korea Electric Company,
Korea National Railroad or Pohang Integrated Iron and Steel Company, and on
the other hand it functions as an efficient allocator of resources raised by
itself independently. In 1975, for instance KDB received from the Government
directly W 32.6 billion and through NIF allocations W 80.1 billion, which
accounted for 55% of KDB's total funds for commitment during that year and
16.2 % of the Government's capital budget for 1975. In the allocation of
these resources, and the funds it raised on its own, KDB emphasized Govern-
ment priorities by supporting export oriented projects (its clients accounted
for over 40% of manufacturing exports of Korea in 1975) and has made sizeable
loans to heavy and chemical industries. (Over the last three years it has
extended a total of US$150 million or 41% of its manufacturing loans to these
two sectors.)
1/   On a commitment basis.



- 22 -
5.04      KDB's Input in Developing Government Policies.  KDB has influenced
the formulation of Government policy by (i) giving its opinions on policy
issues when called upon by the Government, (ii) assisting in Government spon-
sored studies and programs, and (iii) the participation of members of its man-
agement in various Government committees. KDB has carried out numerous stud-
ies, often including specific recommendations, which have subsequently been
used as a basis for discussion within the Government or been incorporated in
various policy measures. Studies that have recently been undertaken include
a survey of major export industries with recommendations for specific action,
forecast of supply structure and computation of investment requirements by
type of industry, specific recommendations for increasing resource mobiliza-
tion for the NIF, a study on industrial estates, sector studies of the ship-
building and iron and steel industries, etc. KDB was also involved in draft-
ing the Korean Industrial Leasing Law. Its studies in the establishment of a
merchant banking system are reflected in the recently enacted Merchant Banking
Law. For the preparation of the country's five-year plans, including the pres-
ent planning exercise, KDB has provided valuable assistance by conducting sur-
veys to build up basic targets, including sector demand/supply forecasts and
investment targets. KDB is well qualified to render this service to the Gov-
ernment, since it has a competent, trained staff, performs regular financial
and production surveys and, through its day-to-day operations, is in close
contact with the business community. Particularly for this latter reason,
the participation of KDB's Governor and other members of management in many
Government committees provides the Government with an additional valuable
perspective in its decision-making process. Committees on which KDB is rep-
resented include the Economic Cabinet Meeeting, the Foreign Capital Induce-
ment Deliberation Committee, the Industrial Rationalization Council and the
Advisory Committee for Economic Planning, the NIF Management Council.
5.05      Apart from the specific contributions stated above, KDB's economic
research is well recognized in Korea and many of its regular studies and
surveys are published and receive wide circulation. For instance, KDB pub-
lishes an exhaustive annual survey of the financial condition of enterprises,
a Monthly Economic Review, a half yearly survey on Equipment Investment and
Program, a Monthly Research Report and Weekly Economic Reports which present
studies on topical domestic and international issues.
Economic Impact of KDB's Lending to the Manufacturing Sector
5.06      KDB's manufacturing clients employ 340,000 workers (15% of total
manufacturing employment), their output during 1975 was valued at US$3.6 bil-
lion (one-third of total industrial output) and their exports in that year
amounted to US$2.1 billion, or over 40% of total manufacturing exports of
Korea. The largely export-oriented manufacturing sector has been the main
engine of growth in the Korean economy and has generated the steady rise
over the past decade, in the standard of living of the Korean people as a
whole and the increased demand for an ever-widening range of consumer goods.



- 23 -
5.07      In project appraisals, KDB's staff pays particular attention to
the planned location of the projects and it has often been successful in per-
suading clients to change location, usually out of congested metropolitan
areas in pursuance of a declared Government policy. KDB has particularly
supported moves by client companies to Government-supported Industrial Estates:
of its total loan commitments to the manufacturing sector in 1975, 23% (US$41
million) went for projects located in Industrial Estates.
5.08      Of the total private sector clients of KDB, 82% are joint stock
companies of which 15% are listed on the Seoul Stock Exchange. In comparison,
the 1973 manufacturing census shows that only 13% of all companies in the
country were joint stock companies of which only 4% were listed. At the end
of 1975 KDB's loan portfolio included more than one third of all companies
listed on the stock exchange. KDB has also supported 38 joint venture enter-
prises importing capital and technical/marketing know-how into the country;
(the foreign partners own 44% of the total share capital).
Economic Rate of Return Analysis
5.09      A sample of 33 projects (including 23 Bank subloans for which KDB
calculated the ERR plus ten projects selected by the appraisal mission) showed
satisfactory returns as indicated below; (details are shown in Annex 26).
Number of Projects
Percentage Range                 FRR              ERR
9.1-15.0                      2               0
15.1-20.0                     13               6
20.1-30.0                     12              16
30.1-more                      6              11
Average                       23%             29%
All projects had an economic rate of return of over 15%, which is above the
present Bank estimate for the opportunity cost of capital in Korea; only six
projects had returns of below 20%. On the other hand, there were 11 projects
with ERR's exceeding 30%, the highest being 54% for a synthetic leather and
shoe manufacturing project, producing 60% for export. The calculation of
the ERR's in KDB's appraisal reports wvas necessarily based on estimated costs
and prices, while the sample of 10 projects selected by the mission were all
projects in full operation for at least three years and data for past years
were all actuals. It is interesting to note that the average ERR for both
samples worked out to be exactly the same, namely 29%.
Influence on Project Design and Technical Assistance
5.10      KDB's influence on project formulation is to a certain extent
limited since project sponsors often approach KDB after basic decisions such
as to product, technologies or location have been taken and are not, or only
with difficulty, reversible.  Nevertheless, KDB's appraisal staff has made
sustained efforts to improve the design of projects under consideration, and



- 24 -
often its proposals for change have been accepted by project sponsors. In
various instances KDB's suggestions have resulted in changes in scale of
operations, composition of products to be produced or even location of the
plant site. With respect to plant location KDB has been particularly con-
cerned to induce companies to locate in industrial estates. KDB's thorough
market analyses have led some sponsors to change their marketing strategies
and in a few cases it has led to the postponement or cancellation of projects.
KDB's technical staff carefully examines technical capabilities of sponsors,
particularly if new technologies are to be introduced and has urged project
sponsors to enter into technical collaboration agreements with foreign com-
panies, when appropriate. The type of equipment to be procured is normally
checked with respect to local availability and KDB's suggestions have often
led to savings in foreign exchange and/or project cost. The financial struc-
ture of prospective client companies is always carefully scrutinized leading
in many instances to increased capital contributions by the sponsors (see
paragraph 5.13). In addition KDB provides consulting services to those clients
confronted with managerial difficulties, often in the form of deputation of its
own staff. To improve appraisal quality of Korean banks, KDB keeps special
files on all customers that have received loans exceeding W 50 million. Other
banks have, on request, access to these files. KDB's technical department
performs, for the Foreign Capital Inducement Deliberation Committee, engineer-
ing surveys on all proposed projects requesting foreign loan guarantees.
Resource Mobilization
5.11      As a wholly owned Government development bank, KDB depends to a
large extent on funds provided by the Government, particularly since the
majority of its loans is for long maturities (75% of equipment loans extended
during 1975 had maturities of 8 years or more) and it is not possible to raise
funds of similar maturities in the capital market in Korea. Consequently the
Government accounts, directly or indirectly, for 71% of KDB's total term
resources in the form of equity (31%), direct loans (18%), loans to and
subscription of IFD's under the IRF (7%) and allocations under the Tourism
Development Fund and National Investment Fund (15%). KDB's domestic currency
resource mobilization at market rates has been limited to the issuance of
Industrial Finance Debentures (8%) that were subscribed by commercial banks
(27%) and individuals (73%) and even these funds could only be raised at a
negative margin (see Annex 18, paragraph 12).
5.12      In its foreign currency resource mobilization KDB has been more
successful. Loans raised from commercial and official sources accounted for
17% of total resources at the end of 1975 and would have been higher but for
the general deterioration in the international financial climate during 1975.
This year KDB already has issued US$25 million IFD's in the Middle East,
a Eurodollar loan of US$80 million and a commercial loan of US$17 million in
Japan. KDB is now planning to establish a Merchant Bank with foreign partic-
ipation to give a new impetus to its efforts to raise funds internationally.
5.13      Apart from raising funds directly as described above, KDB has been
able to mobilize resources indirectly by inducing its clients to increase the



- 25 -
proportion of equity financing in total project costs. An indication of KDB's
success in this regard is obtained from the fact that in 9 of 31 IBRD financed
subprojects, KDB was able to persuade its clients to increase their capital
contributions by a total of US$7.6 million (8% of total project cost or 37% of
KDB's loans for these projects) above the levels originally envisaged by the
sponsors. Overall, KDB's share in average project financing is about 40%
which means that each unit of its lending induces one and a half additional
units of investment.
VI. PROSPECTS
General Outlook
6.01      Despite the oil price increases, raw material shortages and subse-
quent world wide recession, the Korean economy grew by 7.4% in 1975 mainly
because of the relatively good export performance during the second half-year
and record harvests of rice and barley. The goal of economic planning for
1976 and subsequent years is the achievement of the maximum rate of growth
consistent with the maintenance of internal financial stability and a sound
balance of payments. To this end the export-oriented manufacturing sector
is expected to continue to be Korea's engine of growth, though the deepening
of the industrial structure, with the aim of increasing the domestic value
added in exports, will receive increasing attention by the Government.
6.02      In this context, the Korean authorities have recognized that ef-
forts to deepen the industrial structure must proceed selectively and in-
vestments must be geared to expand capacity in industries which are skill-
intensive, reflecting the country's international comparative advantage.
This recognition has led to significant modification of the long-term invest-
ment plans which had been prepared in 1973, specifically, a postponement of
planned rates of expansion of petrochemical and steel production capacity
and a shift of priorities towards electronics and machinery, which are rela-
tively more labor intensive and have shorter gestation periods. The vast
amounts that are expected to be spent for industrial investment (close to
US$9 billion over the Fourth Five Year Plan period, 1977-1981) will put a
heavy burden on Koreas financial sector. KDB is well placed to help in the
mobilization and efficient allocation of these funds and to be a leader among
the Korean financial institutions in helping to achieve the overall economic
goals.
Forecast of Commitments
6.03      Detailed forecasts of KDB's business are given in Annex 27.  Fore-
casts of commitments are summarized below (billion Won):



- 26 -
Domestic    Foreign                                Total
Currency    Currency    Total                      Commit-
Loans       Loans       Loans    Investments       ments
1975 (actual)            182.1         21.0       203.1         74.2        277.3
1976                     188.6         32.4       221.0         31.4        252.4
1977                     230.9         36.1       267.0         18.6        285.6
1978                     280.1         37.8       317.9         19.9        337.8
1979                     341.5         43.3       384.8         21.9        406.7
1980                     415.1         45.1       460.2         23.9        484.1
The 1976 commitment estimates are based on firm Operational Program.  Loan
commitments in 1976 will be moderately higher compared with those in 1975.
Beyond 1976, the estimates of loan commitments in domestic currency are made
on the basis of the rate of growth in recent years tempered by a judgement
about resource availability (loans to be funded from general government bor-
rowings are estimated to increase at the rate of 25%; loans to be funded from
National Investment Fund borrowings are estimated to grow at the rate of 20%
which is the estimated rate of increase of NIF itself; and new commitments of
loans to be funded from Industrial Rationalization Fund are estimated to be
equal to collections of past loans made from IRF as no new funds will be
available). Equity investments, all in domestic currency, are estimated to
be at more normal levels after 1976; these were abnormally high in 1975.
Loan commitments in foreign currency are projected on the basis of KDB's es-
timates of the availability of foreign currency resources from official
sources. Foreign currency resources raised by borrowings from commercial
banks will be used by KDB in its domestic currency operations. The projected
volume of operations is fully attainable from an institutional, management
and staff point of view; the actual level of operations will be determined
by resource availabilities rather than restricted by a lack of demand for
capital. The business forecast is, in fact, conservative and the actual
performance may be considerably better.
Resource Requirements
6.04      For the three-year period 1976-78, KDB will need total capital re-
sources of W 875.8 billion as follows:
Loan Commitments
Domestic currency          W 699.6 billion
Foreign currency              106.3 billion   W  805.9 billion
Equity Investment Commitments (domestic)            W   69.9 billion
Total    W  875.8 billion



- 27 -
The projected 13% ratio of foreign currency loan commitments to total loan
comitments over the period 1976-1978 represents a marginal increase from
the 12% share of foreign currency commitments for the period 1971-1975. It
should, however, be noted that the projected foreign currency loan commitments
do not measure the total import requirements of KDB's clients. Such require-
ments are considerably larger; a portion of domestic currency loans is in fact
converted into foreign exchange and spent on imported plant and equipment.
The figure of foreign currency loan commitments, represents direct imports
which will be funded from borrowings from international institutions.
6.05      To meet the projected commitments, KDB's resource planning for the
same period, 1976-78 envisages raising funds from various sources as follows
(Won in billion):
Balance of uncommitted resources, 1.1.76            44.7
Increase in paid-in capital                         53.7
Collections (net of repayments)                    145.7
Sale of investments                                 31.9
Borrowings from
Government                                      106.1
National Investment Fund                        352.7
Foreign Commercial Banks                         72.7
Asian Development Bank                           24.2
KfW                                               7.6
Industrial Finance Debentures (foreign)             60.6
899.9
In addition, KDB's plans include two loans from the Bank, amounting to W 87.3
billion (the proposed loan and another loan in 1978).
6.06      Of the surplus of projected resources over estimated loan and in-
vestment commitment requirements (W 899.9 + W 87.3 - W 875.8 = W 111.4 bil-
lion), W 95.6 billion would be absorbed in improving KDB's liquidity posi-
tion (see projected balance sheets; current ratio is projected to improve
from 1:1 as at the end of 1975 to 1.6:1 as at the end of 1978). On the
basis of these figures, KDB will start the year 1979 with uncommitted re-
sources of W 15.8 billion only. However, depending on the state of the
international capital markets, KDB may be able to borrow more than the pro-
jected amounts, thus reducing the risk that its liquidity position would
be squeezed again or that its operations would be constrained. It has,
in fact, already contracted foreign commercial loans of $97 million over
and above the amounts included in its borrowing program for 1976. KDB's
borrowing program is given in Annex 28.
Financial Projections
6.07      KDB's projected balance sheets as at December 31, 1976 through
1980 are given in Annex 29. The annual growth rate of total assets during



- 28 -
the projected period, 19%, is considerably lower than that in the last five
years. KDB has assumed a lower growth rate on the basis that the very high
rates of growth of the first half of the seventies cannot be sustained indef-
initely. As remarked earlier in paragraph 6.03, KDB's level of operations
and hence the size of its total assets will in all probability be determined
by its ability to raise resources. The projected growth rate of total assets
is the result of KDB's perception of what it can accomplish in terms of re-
source mobilization.
6.08      As to the composition of projected total assets, loan portfolio is
estimated to increase 2.8 times to W 1,422 billion during the five year period,
and at the end of 1980 would account for 72% of total assets compared with
about 60% at the end of 1975. Current assets will account for about 21%
of total assets at the end of 1980 compared with about 18% at the end of
1975; the current ratio will improve from 1:1 at the end of 1975 to 1.3:1
at the end of 1980 after being even better during the intervening years.
Equity investment portfolio will decline in relative importance; it will
account for only about 10% of total assets at the end of 1980 compared with
17% at the end of 1975.
6.09      On the other side of the Balance Sheet, long-term borrowings are
estimated to double between 1976 and end of 1980. KDB's equity is projected
to increase by 1.8 times during the same period to amount to W 451.9 billion
at the end of 1980. Total debt to equity ratio (including in debt all guaran-
tee obligations not covered under the Guarantee Release Arrangement) will
increase from 3.9 at the end of 1976 to 5.2 at the end of 1980. Long-term
debt/equity ratio, as defined in the Bank Loan Agreement will increase from
3.2 at the end of 1976 to 4.3 at the end of 1980 and will still be within
the 5:1 limit provided in the Agreement.
6.10      KDB's projected Income Statements for the years ended December 31,
1976 through 1980 are given in Annex 30. Based on the forecast of commit-
ments and disbursements, Annex 27, net income is expected to increase from
W 14.1 billion in 1976 to W 28.7 billion in 1980. Throughout the period of
projections, KDB is expected to have a positive spread even on borrowed funds
albeit a small one, which has not always been the case in the past. Future
profitability is expected to remain reasonably satisfactory with return on
total assets ranging between 1.5% - 1.7% and on equity between 5.2% - 6.7%.
6.11      Projected Cash Flow Statements are given in Annex 31.  With an im-
proving liquidity position and declining share of relatively short term re-
sources (deposits and domestic IFDs) in KDB's total resources, the debt ser-
vice cover is expected to improve in future years from 1.06 times in 1976 to
1.24 times in 1980. Even with the improvement, the debt service cover will
remain modest because some of KDB's borrowings have back-to-back repayment
requirement (World Bank and ADB) and some others (foreign commercial borrow-
ings) are for medium term (mostly five years) and net earnings provide only
a modest cushion. KDB will need to continue to do skillful resource planning
and management. KDB's projected indicators of financial and operational per-
formance are given in Annex 32.

Proposed Bank Loan
6.12      Amount.  As stated in paragraph 6.05, KDB's intermediate-term
borrowing program includes two loans from the Bank, amounting to W 87.3
billion in total (US$180 million). It is recommended that the Bank con-
sider $82.5 million as the amount for the proposed loan, of which $7.5
million would be for its subsidiary, KILC.
6.13      Objectives.  One of the two principal objectives of the proposed
loan is to continue the Bank's institution building role and beneficial im-
pact on KDB as a whole. Specific actions in this regard have been indicated
at various points in the report. 1/ Transfer of resources to well appraised
projects will be the other principal objective. KDB has demonstrated its
ability to use Bank funds efficiently on projects which are economically
justified and financially attractive. However, as pointed out in paragraph
2.14, KDB will now add one more dimension to its appraisal standards and
criteria: employment impact. During negotiations KDB accepted the Bank's
suggestion that its appraisal reports in the future would explicitly deal
with the aspects of choice of technology and more labor intensive produc-
tion processes. KDB has indicated that the bulk of the proposed loan would
be used in financing projects in the manufacturing sector, which in the Bank's
judgement will continue to be the leading growth sector. KDB has indicated
that the proceeds would be lent to the private sector, although the public
sector would also be eligible to benefit. Direct imports only will be fi-
nanced. Under Loan 1095-KO, sub-loan maturities have ranged (with two excep-
tions) from 10 to 15 years including grace periods of 1.5 to 3 years, with a
weighted average loan life of 12.4 years. The pattern is unlikely to change
materially in the future.
6.14      For the KILC portion of the loan, US$7.5 million, it is proposed
to have specific project eligibility criteria. The aim is to experiment
with a well managed leasing company as an intermediary to reach small scale
enterprises and to have a favorable impact on urban employment. Enter-
prises with total assets of up to W 600 million 2/ or projects with estimated
cost of up to US$15,000 equivalent per new job created would be eligible.
However, if KILC seeks exemption from these limits for projects in health care
(e.g. hospitals) and academic (e.g. schools, scientific research institutions)
fields, the Bank would agree subject to a cumulative maximum of US$1.5 million,
20% of the proposed loan amount for KILC. It has further been agreed that (i)
the loan to KILC be on a fixed schedule for fifteen years so that KILC's
resources are augmented by "revolving funds" (typical lease periods are up to
six years) which it will be able to relend without incurring exchange risk (on
1/   Paragraphs 2.10, 2.13, 2.14, 2.19, 3.22, 3.23, 4.03 and 4.14.
2/   The limit of W 600 million conforms with the definition of small
scale enterprises in Korea for lending in foreign exchange.



- 30 -
"maintenance of value" basis, which is not uncommon in Korea), and (ii) since
the machinery and equipment required by some small lessees would be procured
locally, the Bank would finance the foreign exchange component, estimated at
60%, of locally procured equipment.
6.15      In order to obtain a reasonable sectoral distribution of the sub-
loans, no more than 25% of the proposed loan amount would be used to finance
projects in any non-manufacturing sector; within the manufacturing sector,
this percentage would apply to individual industries. KDB will also use US$5
million of the proposed loan for the domestic construction industry in view
of the potential this industry possesses for job creation. Also, in order to
ensure that the bulk of the proposed loan is not used for just a few very
large projects, it is proposed to limit the size of a normal single sub-loan
to a maximum of US$5 million but to allow larger sub-loans on an exceptional
basis if requested by KDB after its Board has deliberately and explicitly
concluded, on the basis of the merits of the project, that it should request
the Bank to agree to exceptional treatment. The projections show that KDB
will not exceed the 5:1 debt/equity limitation stipulated in the first Bank
Loan Agreement in the foreseable future, and no change is proposed in the
debt/equity ratio limit. The "free limit" is proposed to be increased from
US$750,000 to US$1.5 million; with the proposed "free limit," the Bank could
still expect to receive projects for prior approval accounting for 70% of the
proposed loan amount. Subproject submissions from KILC to the Bank would be
routed through KDB since KDB will be the primary obligor. However, it is
proposed to set up separate and detailed reporting requirements for KILC and
to have semi-annual supervision missions instead of the more normal annual
supervision.
6.16      Agreements Reached.  During negotiations for the proposed loan,
understandings were reached with KDB (recorded in agreed minutes) on the
following:
(a) KDB's appraisal reports, in the future, will deal explicitly
with the aspects of the choice of technology and more labor
intensive production processes so as to indicate that due
weight was given to the employment effects of the sub-
projects. Also KDB will enlarge the scope of the economic
rate of return analysis (paragraphs 2.13 and 2.14).
(b) In the interest of the diversification of KDB's overall
portfolio and specifically for the diversification of
KDB's on-lending of IBRD funds, KDB will not lend more
than 20 to 25% of the proposed loan to any one sector
other than manufacturing; within the manufacturing sector
sector, the 20-25% limitation will apply to individual
industries. KDB will also use $5 million of the proposed
loan for the domestic construction industry in view of
the potential this industry possesses for job creation
(paragraph 6.15).



- 31 -
(c) Lending from the KILC portion of the proposed loan will
normally be limited to enterprises with total assets of
up to W 600 million or projects with estimated cost of
up to US$15,000 equivalent per new job (paragraph 6.14).
(d) An arrangement between the Government and KDB, whereby the
Government would in affect assume the risks on projects
which KDB finances acting as an agent only (paragraph
2.19).
(e) An understanding by the Government to normally increase
KDB's capital through cash contributions or loan con-
versions. If under exceptional circumstances subscrip-
tions by the Government to KDB's capital would be made
by way of share transfer, the transfer price of such
shares would not be lower than their appraised value
(paragraph 3.22).
(f) A phasing out schedule of the cases which exceeded the
new financial prudence limits set in KDB's Policy State-
ment of April 9, 1975 (paragraph 2.10).
(g) KDB would make an account-by-account analysis, in collab-
oration with its external auditors to determine the ap-
propriate provisions during the course of audit of its
1976 accounts and that such provisions would be properly
treated in its balance sheet (paragraph 4.14).
(h) KDB would make every effort to lessen the importance of
short-term IFD's in its total resources.

KOREA DEVELOPMENT BANK
Economic, Industrial and Financial Environment
I.   Economic Overview
1.        For a detailed review of the recent economic situation and pro-
spects please refer to the Bank's last economic report of Korea: Current
Economic Position and Prospects of the Republic of Korea, May 26, 1975,
768-KO. The most recent developments are discussed in the President's
Report on a Program Loan to the Government of Korea, dated February 17,
1976. A Basic Economic Mission visited Korea in June-July 1976; its report
is under preparation.
2.        Overall Economic Performance - In the 1970's the Korean economic
situation has been subject to sudden and sharp changes (see Economic Reports
No. 768-KO of May 1975 and No. 332-KO of February 1974). Following a period
of rapid economic growth the Government undertook a stabilization program
during 1970-72 as a result of which real investment did not increase and the
growth of real GNP slowed to 8% per year. In 1973, international demand grew
rapidly and Korea took full advantage of its opportunities. As a result,
there was an unprecedented boom: real GNP grew by 16.5% and export volume
by 57%; national savings rose to 22% of GNP and foreign savings financed only
about 15% of total investment. However, the situation changed rapidly as the
energy crisis and worldwide recession hit the Korean economy. Fueled by sharp
increases in import prices (55% for the whole of 1974) the domestic wholesale
price index jumped by 42% in 1974 after it had averaged 9% the preceeding five
years. Export prices on the other hand rose at a slower rate resulting in a
deterioration in the terms of trade of around 19%. At the same time, domestic
real demand began to soften and the recession in the industrial countries
which absorbed over 85 percent of Korea's exports in 1973, greatly slowed the
export drive. As a result of these developments, economic indicators for 1974
were markedly lower than in the exceptional boom year of 1973. GNP grew by
8.2 percent, exports and imports (by volume) by 9% and 4% respectively,
national savings as percentage of GNP dropped to 19%, the current account
deficit rose from US$309 million to US$2.04 billion while at the same time net
foreign exchange reserves dropped from US$1.1 billion to US$0.3 billion.
3.        The slowdown in domestic production would have been greater but for
various government measures to sustain employment which during 1971 to 1975
grew at an annual rate of 3.9%. In December 1974, the currency was devalued
by 17.5 percent to Won 485 to US$1. Special credits were extended through the
banking system to enable induLstry to finance accumulating inventories, and the
Government purchased excess inventories of finished goods from industries
particularly hard hit by the fall in export demand. Subsidized credit was
also extended to small firms and exporters to ease their financial situation.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
4.        In 1975 Korea continued to face a protracted recession in inter-
national demand for its exports and added pressures on its domestic resources.
The international terms of trade again deteriorated in 1975 (by about 10 per-
cent), to bring the total terms of trade loss in 1974 and 1975 to about 7 per-
cent of GNP (at 1970 prices and exchange rates). At the same time, domestic
prices continued to rise and, by the end of 1975, the domestic wholesale
price index was 20% ahead of the level of 1974. Consumer demand continued
to be weak, for instance, the retail trade index for Seoul was about 9%
lower in 1975 than in 1974, while investment activities grew slower in 1975
than in 1974 and particularly 1973. Despite the continued weakness of do-
mestic demand, the industrial production index rose by 19% during 1975 owing
partly to official intervention to purchase finished products of export
industries and partly to a sharp increase in the export volume in the latter
part of 1975. Because of the continued growth in industrial and other activ-
ities including agriculture, the unemployment rate remained fairly stable at
4.1% during 1974 and 1975. The rise in exports in 1975 of 13% was remarkable
considering the market conditions and was mainly due to strong efforts to
diversify the concentration of exports geographically and product-wise. Thus,
while in 1973 70% of Korea's exports went to the United States and Japan the
share of these countries in 1974 and 1975 dropped to 64% and 55% respectively.
Particularly, Korea has made, with some success, great efforts to enter the
market for manufactured products in oil exporting countries, and during the
past year has also won sizeable construction contracts in the Middle East.
5.        Current Prospects.  In 1975, the real GNP is estimated to have
risen by 7.4% because of the relatively good export performance and record
harvests of rice and barley. Exports have grown by around 13% (at current
prices) while the growth of imports was contained to around 4% (at current
prices); the trade deficit thus has declined by over US$300 million as com-
pared to 1974. Nevertheless, for 1975 the current account deficit still
reached US$2.0 billion, the same level as in 1974, while it is expected to
drop to US$1.5 billion in 1976. Since net resource had already decreased
to a rather low level through substantial draw-downs in 1974, the 1975
deficit was financed to a larger share by medium and long term capital
movements (57% as compared to 42% in 1974) and other short term capital
and bank borrowings (41%; 14% in 1974). In 1976, the share of medium and
long term capital movements in covering the deficit is expected to further
increase to 78%, the bulk of the increase being from official sources such
as the Bank and ADB, while other short term capital and bank borrowings
would decrease to 18%. The rate of fixed investments is projected to be
sustained, in 1976, at 1974 levels of about 24.5 percent of GNP. The great
bulk of investment resources will continue to go to the manufacturing sec-
tor and immediately associated infrastructure requirements, with export
growth being one of the principal criteria in selecting investment projects.
The ratio of national savings to GNP was 18.1% in 1975 and is expected to
be around 18.5% in 1976 and should continue to improve, resulting from the
variety of measures being undertaken by the Government to improve public
savings and from the expected favorable response of private savings to the
control of inflation.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
6.        The goal of economic planning for the Fourth Five-Years Plan (1977-
1981) is the achievement of the maximum rate of growth consistent with the
maintenance of internal financial stability, employment creation, a sound
balance of payments and a wider distribution of the fruits of growth. To
this end the export oriented manufacturing sector is expected to continue
to be Korea's engine of growth. In order to respond to emerging changes in
Korea's competitive advantage and with the aim to increase the domestic
value added in exports, the Government is also paying increased attention to
the deepening of the industrial structure. In recognition of constraints on
foreign earnings and external borrowings, there has been a significant down-
ward modification of the expected rate of growth of the economy. Previously,
long-term plans envisaged a growth of 11% p.a. in GNP; the current expecta-
tions for the Fourth Plan are in the region of 9%. As with the lowering in
growth forecasts it also became evident that long-term investment plans
would have to be modified to lower similarly planned rates of expansion of
heavy industries especially petrochemical and steel production capacities,
to shift priorities towards electronics and machinery. These sectors are
relatively more labor intensive, thus more readily applying Korea's compe-
titive advantage, and have a shorter gestation period, thus having a more
immediate impact on the balance of payments. The continued growth of labor
intensive technologies will be even more important since Korea will have to
create an estimated two million jobs over the Fourth Plan period, half of
which are planned to be provided by the Industrial Sector. Despite Korea's
recent export performance under difficult circumstances and the demonstrated
flexibility of economic policy making, the recovery of international demand
is the most important element which will determine the extent to which the
Korean economy will be able to achieve the Government's goals, or exceed
them.
II. INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
7.        The Role of Industry in the Economy.  Since the early 1960's manu-
facturing has been the fastest growing sector in the Korean economy with an
average annual growth rate of 19% over the last five years, accountinag for
49% of the increase in GNP during that period. Its share of GNP has in-
creased from 21.6% in 1970 to 28.0% in 1975 being the largest sector in the
economy. The success of Korean manufacturers in capturing markets abroad
has been one of the main factors in the rapid development of the Korean
economy in recent years. In 1975, for instance, exports of manufactured
goods amounted to US$4.1 billion or 82% of total commodity exports (up from
US$650 million or 77% in 1970) and accounted for over one fifth of the
Korean Gross National Product in 1975 (8% in 1970). In 1975 over 2.1 mil-
lion persons or 18.1% of the labor force were employed in the manufacturing
sector (up from 13.2% in 1970) and of all new jobs created over the past 5
years in Korea, the manufacturing sector provided almost 40%. Although Korea
has undertaken many capital intensive industrial projects in recent years the
share of the manufacturing sector in the country's domestic fixed capital
formation has remained very stable amounting on the average to 22.7% over the
last five years comparing to 22.8% for the preceeding five years.
8.        Current Performance.  The manufacturing sector's value added is
estimated to have increased by close to 12% in real terms in 1975, compared



ANNEX I
Page 4
to 17.5% in 1974 and a record growth of 30.9% in 1973. The slowdown in
growth was caused by the effects of the worldwide recessions in 1974 and 1975
on Korea's exports of manufactured goods and the export growth rates of nearly
40% in 1974 and 12% in 1975 were largely due to price increases though the
volume of exports picked up again during the second half of 1975. The pro-
duction index for manufacturing industries rose by 19% in 1975 compared to
27.6% in 1974, whereby the growth was about twice as high in the second half
of the year than in the first half. While production increases in 1974 went
to a large extent into build-up of inventories, which grew at 45.9%, shipments
in 1975 grew faster than production indicating a relative reduction in inven-
tories. The recovery in the second half of 1975 was led by textiles, wearing
apparel, leather and footwear which grew by 35%, mainly due to a recovery in
export demand. Fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment grew also
at a satisfactory rate (18%), while basic metals grew by only 9% compared
to the record growth rates of 87% in 1974, mainly because of the weakness of
demand in export markets.
9.        Structure of Industry.  Measured in terms of value added in 1974,
light manufactures accounted for over two-thirds of total industrial value
added. The growth performance of the sub-sectors varied but was very good
throughout as the following table shows (amounts in billion Won).

ANNEX 1
Page 6
In 1974 the Korean manufacturing activities were still concentrated in the
more labor intensive light industries sector which accounted for over two-
thirds of the manufacturing value added in 1974. Textiles, footwear and
leather is the largest sub-sector and, together with food, beverages and
tobacco, accounted for over 50% of industrial output. The slight increase
in the share of light manufactures over the past 5 years was mainly due to
the excellent export performance of the textiles, leather and small electri-
cal equipment industries. The increased emphasis of the Government on the
deepening of the industrial structure, on the other hand, have not yet
been reflected in 1974 output figures as several heavy industries projects
have only been completed recently or are only in the planning stage.
10.       Of a total of 23,000 industrial enterprises in Korea in 1973 1/
96.5% employed less than 200 workers each. However, in terms of employment
and valued added, such enterprises accounted for only 40% and 27% of the
total, respectively. Despite adequate promotional policies and availability
of finance, the relative importance of small and medium sized enterprises in
the total industrial structure has been declining as the Korean economy
expanded and modernized. In 1973, for instance, small enterprises accounted
for 22% of total fixed investment while it was 31% in 1968. Small enter-
prises' share in total value added (from 36% to 27%) and total employment
(from 54% to 39%) has also declined since 1968. Nevertheless small and medium
scale industries in Korea are competitive with many large scale enterprises
and perform important ancillary functions. An indication of the economic
viability of small and medium industries is given by their exports which
have quadrupled between 1970 and 1973 and accounted for 37% of total
exports in 1973 compared to 32% in 1970.
11.       The largest industrial centers in Korea still are the cities of
Seoul and Busan which accounted for 34% of enterprises, 50% of employment
and 45% of output of the manufacturing Sector. However, the Government has
become increasingly aware of the need for a wider geographical location in
order to achieve a better regional distribution of employment opportunities
and to reduce the congestion and overcrowding in Seoul and Busan. The
Government has therefore been promoting the development of industrial centers
outside these two areas, mainly through the establishment of free trade zones
and industrial estates some of which are planned to eventually become fully
integrated industrial complexes of both large and small-medium enterprises.
The Government provides special incentives for companies to move to such
estates and by the end of 1975 Industrial Estates and Export Zones accounted
for around 5% of industrial enterprises, 9% of industrial employment and 25%
of manufactured exports of Korea.
1/ Figures in this and the next paragraph are based on the latest manufactur-
ing census, 1973. The census does not define "small", "medium" and "large"
enterprises but the Small Industry Basic Act defines small and medium
industries as enterprises with less than 200 workers or with total assets
of less than W 50 million.

12.       Financial Position 1/.  As a result of the remarkable performance
of the Korean economy in 1973 industrial enterprises were able to improve their
financial position and performance considerably. Business profits had been
seriously affected by the slowdown in economic activity during 1970-72 and
the Government had to take strong measures to improve the financial position
of business enterprises, in particular their debt structure which had been
heavily dependent on the high cost, short-term 'curb' market for financing.
The aggregate debt/equity ratio 2/ of manufacturing enterprises fell from
4.2 in 1971 to 2.8 in 1972 mainly as the result of these measures. This
ratio fell further in 1973 to 2.6. Average interest on borrowed funds fell
from 14.1% to 9.3% as a result of the debt restructuring. Profitability also
improved markedly during the period; net income as a percentage of total
liabilities and net worth increased from 0.5% in 1971 to 6.9% in 1973.
Increases in production costs tended to lag behind price increases as demand
for Korea's manufactured goods picked up rapidly. Due to the slackening
demand at home and abroad, the favorable trend of 1973 was reversed in 1974.
Profits decreased to 4.4% relative to total assets (decreasing in absolute
terms by about 17%) mainly due to a disproportionately large increase in
the cost of goods sold (64%) as compared to the increase in the sales volume
(40%). Enterprises had to resort to increased borrowings, particularly
short-term bank and trade credits and the debt/equity ratio increased to 3.0
from 2.6 in 1973. Over 60% of the borrowings was used to finance the increased
inventory, which rose from 17.1% of total assets in 1973 to 20.8% in 1974. It
is interesting to note that despite the deterioration in the financial struc-
ture of enterprises, the loss due to bad debts, though increasing by 13% in
absolute terms, slightly decreased in proportion to sales during the priod.
However, this seems to have been mainly due to the build up of sufficient
reserves in 1973 and may have been reversed in 1975, as reportedly business
failures have increased.
13.       Industrial Policies and Development Strategy.  In order to promote
industrial development in general and to direct industrial investment to par-
ticular sectors, the Government provides various incentives, the package of
which includes reductions in corporate, business and income tax rates, defer-
ment, reduction or exemption from duty, easy access to credit, preferential
interest rates and depreciation and other allowances. Incentives are also
extended to attract foreign investment, encourage public ownership of closely
held companies and to promote decentralization of industries.  Besides these
incentives, a number of other measures aim solely at the small-medium scale
industrial sector. Export incentives have very successfully been provided to
industry though recently such incentives had fallen somewhat compared to the
late sixties and early seventies as the adjusted real effective exchange rate
had fallen from a high of 557.2 in 1973 to 458.2 in the middle of 1975 and

which was since further eroded through a faster inflation in Korea than in her
trading partners. To direct imports and to protect certain industries the
Government has set up a system of import licensing, advance deposits and
tariffs which ranges from the free import of raw materials for which import
licenses are automatically approved to the import of non-essential goods with
import duties exceeding 50% and requiring advanced import deposits to luxury
and other items, the importation of which is altogether prohibited. Of the
1,312 SITC basic items 66 were prohibited from imports in the first half of
1976, while 590 were restricted. Between 1973 and 1976 such restrictions or
prohibitions affected between 13 and 26% of total imports. Advance deposits
are required for most categories of imports. They are to be made mostly at
the time of the issue of the corresponding import license and are retained
for 90 days or up to the time of actual settlement, whichever is longer.
Advance deposits range from 0% for raw materials for exports and oil to 5%
to 10% for grains and 20% for non essential goods. Koreas tariff structure
implies a nominal tariff rate of 31.3% (38.8% before 1973). The number of
exemptions, however, is substantial so that the effective tariff rate,
measured as total duty collection over total imports has amounted to only
5% in 1975.
14.       Over the last decade planning for the development of industry cen-
tered around the aim of expanding the export of manufactures rather than on
concentrating entirely on import-substitution, as many developing countries
had done in the early 1960's. This strategy served Korea well in a period
of continuous growth, but has also made Korean industry vulnerable in a time
of international recession. Korea's industrial plans in recent years have,
therefore, been aimed at diversifying the economy and developing more inte-
grated industries. Since 1970, over half of the total industrial investment
has been allocated to chemical, petroleum and basic metal industries to ensure
the supply of raw materials at stable prices. The establishment of Korea's
first integrated steel plant at Pohang (currently being expanded from an annual
output of 1 million to 2.6 million tons), the large shipyard at Ulsan, and
the naptha cracking plant and related operations at the Ulsan oil refining
complex, were major steps in the deepening of the industrial structure. The
recent economic setbacks have necessitated a re-examination of the long-
term development plans and the strategy underlying them. While the emphasis
on increasing the share of heavy industry in exports and on enhancing the
domestic content of manufactures remain generally valid, the program for
heavy and chemical industries is being critically evaluated and reoriented
to meet changing circumstances; some heavy industry projects have been
deferred, if not altogether eliminated, especially those which are extremely
capital- and energy-intensive. As pointed out earlier, the manufacturing
sector is expected to play a cruc:ial role in providing employment opportunities
during the Fourth Five-Year Plan as the expected growth in the labor force of
3.1% is to be off-set mainly by a 7.4% growth in manufacturing employment (or
half of the total growth in employment). The heavy emphasis in the Government's
Fourth Five-Year Plan on a high growth rate of GNP and labor intensive manu-
facturing exports is, therefore, very sound and makes the provision of suf-
ficient financial resources to the light manufactured goods industries even
more important.



ANNEX 1
Page 9
15.       Notwithstanding the scaling down of Korea's original plans to expand
the very capital intensive heavy and chemical industry sector it is apparent
that the restructuring and expansion of Korea's industrial sector will require
a heavy outlay of capital. The Government has therefore embarked on a major
effort to mobilize the funds required by increasing domestic savings. Apart
from the Government's concentrated efforts to bring inflation rates down and
thereby strengthen the confidence of the public in the financial system, the
first specific measure taken by the Government was the introduction, in April
1976, of the new wage-earners savings scheme. Under this scheme persons with
incomes of W 250,000 monthly or less can save up to 30% of their monthly in-
comes subject to a maximum of W 50,000 in a special 3-5 year loan deposit in
the Citizens National Bank or securities savings plan administered by selected
securities brokerage firms. Through interest subsidies the effective yield
for savers is between 25% and 27% p.a. and thus should provide strong incentives
for savers. Another measure taken was the general increase, on August 2, 1976,
of the interest rate structure, particularly the general increase in deposit
rates (see para 25).   Other measures have not yet been specified but probably
would include a forced savings scheme under a Welfare Pension Plan and a Whole
Life Insurance Scheme. The major channel which the Government set up in 1973
to direct the flow from the various savings institutions to the heavy and
chemical industries is the National Investment Fund (NIF) which by 1981 is
expected to channel, via the banking system, about three-fourths of total
investment needs to major industries.
III. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
16.       Institutional Set-up.  The financial sector of Korea consists of
the Bank of Korea, Deposit Money Banks, non-monetary financial institutions
and a Securities Exchange. The Bank of Korea performs regular central bank-
ing functions, including the supervision of commercial banks. Deposit Money
Banks are either commercial banks or specialized banks. Commercial banks are
those receiving their funds mainly through deposits from the public. They can
make all kinds of loans; however, they have traditionally concentrated on
short-term lending. Recently they have increased their long-term lending
business, and roll-over of short-term loans is also common. Four of the five
nationwide commercial banks are fully controlled by the Government which
under the Korean law automatically receives majority rights if its holding in
a nationwide bank is 10% or more. The fifth bank is controlled by the semi-
official Korean Traders Association. All commercial banks are subject to
control and supervision by the Bank of Korea. Specialized Banks in contrast
are directly controlled by the Ministry of Finance. They were all established
under a Special Banking Act and are subject to only a few specific Articles
of the Bank of Korea Act and General Banking Act. Specialized Banks, as their
name implies, were founded for particular purposes or sectors (such as small-
scale industry financing, agricultural financing) and they receive Govern-
ment funds as part of their financial resources in addition to resources
raised otherwise. At the end of 1973 specialized banks accounted for about\
one-half of total assets of all banking institutions and 60% of the total
number of branch offices.



ANNEX 1
Page 10
17.       There are five nationwide commercial banks, ten banks with localized
operations, nine branches and four representative offices of foreign banks
and the Korea Trust Bank, which together have 495 branches/offices around
the country (all these fall under the term "commercial banks"). Specialized
Banks include the Korea Development Bank, the Korea Exchange Bank, which in
1967 was established mainly to relieve the Bank of Korea of commercial
foreign exchange business, the Medium Industry Bank which extends financial
and technical assistance to small and medium scale industries, the Citizens
National Bank (mainly for mobilizing small savings and financing household
loans and small enterprises), the Korea Housing Bank, the National Agricultural
Cooperative Federation (NACF) and the Agriculture and Fisheries Development
Corporations (AFDC).
18.       Besides the above-mentioned banking institutions (the "Monetary
System") there are several non-bank financing institutions, namely trust
accounts of commercial banks, six life insurance companies, the postal savings
system, the Korean Development Finance Corporation (KDFC) which specializes
in providing medium- and long-term capital, the Korean Investment Corporation
(KIC), primarily a broker for the offering and distribution of corporate
securities, the Korea Investment and Finance Corporation (KIFC) which pro-
vides short-term finance to the private industrial sector, nine other short-
term finance corporations and the Korea Capital Corporation, all of which
deal in short-term money market instruments. In addition, there were 278
mutual savings and finance companies at the end of June 1974 and some 1,300
authorized credit unions. At the end of 1975, the Government had under prep-
aration a new law which is to regulate the establishment of merchant banks.
The main purpose of these merchant banks would be to raise medium- and long-
term funds abroad and in the domestic market and to channel these to private
enterprises. Under the law, merchant banks would be allowed to perform al-
most any kind of financial services (except accepting deposits) including
guarantee of commercial papers, underwriting of securities, issuing of deben-
tures, leasing and trust business. After this law is passed by the National
Assembly, it is expected that a number of new institutions will be set up,
including joint ventures with large overseas banking corporations.
19.       As of December 31, 1975, total loans outstanding to the manufactur-
ing sector by all banking institutions in Korea amounted to over W 1,900 bil-
lion ($3.9 billion equivalent), three-fourths of which was for operating funds,
mainly supplied by commercial banks. The largest supplier of equipment fund
loans was KDB which, as of August 31, 1975, had an outstanding portfolio of
Won 149 billion (about US$307 million) or about 40% of total outstanding medium-
and long-term credit by banking institutions to industry as of that date.
20.       Some Specific Characteristics of the Financial System.  Besides the
division of the banking sector in commercial and specialized banks with a
fairly distinctive division of labor there are several other characteristics
of the Korean financial system which will be dealt with by the current eco-
nomic mission and which are briefly summarized here. First the Government's



ANNEX 1
Page 11
control o' practically all operating aspects of Korean banking institutions
is pervasive extending from the setting of interest rates, specifying of com-
position of assets portfolio and effectively pre-determining the overall
allocation of loanable funds to even setting salary scales for bank employees,
expenditure budgets and dividend payment policies, thus leaving very little
room for independent policy making of the institutions themselves. The
effectiveness of Government controls is supplemented by the dependence of
the major institutions on Government funds and BOK's rediscount facilities.
Second,-the Government has developed a series of preferential schemes which
were developed to direct flows of financial resources to priority sectors,
lower the cost to preferred users or to increase returns to a target savings
segment. Such schemes, most of which are essentially schemes to preempt
available resources from various institutions, include the NIF, which in
only two years has grown to the most important source of funds for the heavy
and chemical industries, the various export promotion schemes, MIB-credit
guarantee scheme, the wage-earners savings scheme (see para. 15), etc. The
Government's restrictive influence coupled with a seemingly long tradition
of centralization of activities has often resulted in operating conditions
that are not competitive in many respects and sometimes inefficient. Pro-
fitability of banks has been modest despite fairly large spreads, and the
Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Korea have recently announced that a
program to rationalize the financial market would be established. Finally,
there exists an unregulated or "curb" market which constitutes, particularly
for small and medium sized firms, a sometimes important source of working
capital funds and for the savers, participating in it, a highly favorable
investment with rates roughly between 3 and 4% per month.
21.       Capital Market.  Some characteristics of the development of the
Korean Stock Market over the last six years are shown in the following

The Korea Stock Market was moribund for many years but showed signs of life
in 1972. Before then the yields on stock were unattractive as both commer-
cial banks and the "curb market" paid high interest rates. The market was
also thin because closely held companies were reluctant to go public. With
the economic boom that got under way from about mid-1972 and with additional
measures the public showed growing interest in the stock market. The curb
market was severely checked as a result of August 3, 1972 measures and
with decreasing interest rates at commercial banks, yields on stocks
became attractive. In addition, the overall investment climate became
very favourable after August 1972 and the campaign for more stock listings
and for companies to go public intensified. The result was a great increase
in stock exchange activity in the second half of 1972 and in 1973. In 1974
trading activities on the exchange slowed down considerably, due to the
gloomy business outlook though stock listings continued to rise reaching
almost 500 million at the end of 1974.
22.       With the general improvement of the business climate, particularly
the turn around in the export outlook, trading picked up again around mid
1975 and for the year the sales volume almost doubled. The Government con-
tinued to give strong incentives for companies to go public, in some instances
even designating companies to open up, and during 1975 the number of listed
companies rose to 189 from 128 in 1974. At the same time the number of share-
holders rose by 46% to 291,000 at year end and the number of listed stocks
reached 825 million having grown by 69% during 1975. Also listed on the
stock exchange at the end of 1975 were 92 issues of corporate bonds and 227
issued of government bonds and bonds by state run enterprises. Yields of
bonds are about 21%-23% while stocks earned around 13%. However, including
capital gains, stocks have had an average yield of about 47% in 1975. Over
the years the ownership structure has broadened as between 1970 and 1975
the share of owners with less than 1,000 shares doubled. Still this group
accounts for only 5% of all shares although it is made up of 83% of all share
owners. At the same time the role of the Government as a major shareholder
on the Exchange was further reduced in recent years, its share dropping from
63% in 1966 to 39% in 1970 and 14% at the end of 1975. The Banks' share in
the market also fell from 15% in 1970 to 8% in 1975. On the other hand in-
dividual ownership rose from 35% to 55% over the same period.
23.       One reason for the fast rise in operations of the Stock Exchange-
daily average sales volumes traded during 1975 were over 1 million compared
to only 170,000 in 1971 - was the improvement of the market system itself.
Among others the call market was replaced by a continuous auction market,
two investment trust companies were established, marked operations were
automatized and the information system greatly improved. Despite the
very impressive growth of the Stock Exchange several weaknesses remain.
One of the more important problems lies in existing laws which specify
that new equity issues have to be at par irrespective of the market prices
of the stocks. Profitable companies are thus unable to take advantage of
high price earnings ratios while companies whose shares are traded below



ANNEX 1
Page 13
par obtain higher prices than is warranted. The Government is presently
studying the pricing system of new shares issues and is likely to take
steps into the right direction as it has recently done with the relaxing
of the rigid yield structure for bond issues.
24.       Interest Rates.  The Government of Korea through the Monetary
Board determines interest rate ceilings on deposits and loans which apply
to all banking institutions. Specialized financial institutions such as
KDFC or the short term finance companies are not legally bound; however,
in practice they, too, have to follow government policies. The develop-
ment of Korea's interest rate structure has, between 1968 and 1973, seen
a continuous reduction in both deposit and lending rates. The lowering
of the rates coincided, in general, with the Government's gradual success
in bringing inflation down until late 1973 when the inflation rate jumped
up again. 1/ With the emergence of the oil crisis and the general world-
wide inflation, Korea's price structure was particularly hard-hit because
of its high foreign trade dependence. The yearly average wholesale price
index increased from 7.6% for the period 1966-1970 to 15.5% for 1970-1975,
as increases of 42% and 26% were recorded in 1974 and 1975 respectively.
While the Government selectively increased interest rates at the end of
1974, raising time deposits for over three months (12%) and over six
months (13.2%) to 15% and preferential rates for loans from the NIF and
IRF from 9% and 8% respectively to 12%, it did not raise interest rates
in general because it felt that enterprises were already under great pres-
sure through the general economic difficulties and because it hoped to
succeed in bringing inflation under control.
25.       Improvements observed in the first half of 1976 - the wholesale
price index rose by only 9.2% on an annual basis - suggest that inflation
could be brought down to an expected rate of 10% in 1976 and slightly
below that level in the following years. Despite this record the
Government revised the interest rate structure as of August 2, 1976
with two main objectives in mind: a) to improve interest incomes for
savers and b) to introduce some explicit differentiation for risk and
maturity in the rates of interest charged by the banking sector. Inter-
est rates on time deposits have been raised by 1.2 to 2.4 percentage
points, depending on maturity with one year time deposits earning 16.2%
and 3 months deposits 15.0%. Interest rates under the Wage Earners'
Savings Scheme, already attractive before August 2, 1976, have been
further raised, with deposits with 5 years maturity earning 28.2%. The
lending rates of commercial banks have been raised by 1.5 to 3.5 per-
centage points, depending on the financial status of the borrower and the
maturity of the loan. In place of a uniform interest rate of 15.5%,
banks now charge 17% on loans for up to 3 years, 18% on loans for 3 to
8 years and 19% on loans for over 8 years maturity. Lending rates are
lower by 1 percent for prime enterprises, to be selected after an
1/   Inflation rates between May 1972 and November 1973, when the impact
of the oil crisis could first be felt, grew at only 7.1% p.a.



ANNEX 1
Page 14
evaluation of the financial status. Government regulations explicitly
state that the "standard for medium and small enterprises shall be less
complex and stringent than the one applicable to large enterprises."
The effects of these changes in the interest rate structure are likely to
be beneficial. The increase in deposit rates relative to prevailing in-
terest rates on the curb market and on financial instruments in the short-
term money market should improve the mobilization of deposits by the bank-
ing system. This is a key element in the program for improved resource
mobilization in the forthcoming Fourth Five-Year Plan period (1977-1981).
By introducing differentiation by risk and maturity, the structure of
lending rates has been rationalized.
26.       As to other deposit rates, rates of short-term finance com-
panies vary between 11% and 18%, Government bonds effectively yield
between 18% and 21%, and dividend yields on the market value of common
stock averaged 13% in 1975 with capital gains during that year averaging
around 30%. Besides the general lending rates of commercial banks (17%
to 19% 1/) preferential rates are granted for various sectors or types
of loans such as loans for exports (8%), equipment loans for the machine
industry production (13% to 15% 1/) and loans made from proceeds of the
NIF (13% to 14% 1/). Rates on the curb market could be as high as 45 to
50% p.a. Rates on foreign exchange loans made by KDB, MIB and KDFC are
usually at 10% to 11% with the exchange risk 2/ borne by the borrower.
General loans of KDB in domestic currency but funded from foreign com-
mercial borrowings carry a rate of 12% with the foreign exchange risk also
passed on to the sub-borrower, through a value maintenance clause.
27.       In evaluating the structure of the lending rates Korean financial
institution charge, due consideration has to be given to the fact that there
exist distinctly two groups of lending rates: preferential rates, and
general rates. Preferential rates, as mentioned above, are given to various
priority sectors and constitute a part of the Government's incentives pack-
age. In the period 1971-1975, such loans accounted for over 40% of all
loans by Deposit Money Banks and KDB. general lending rates are charged
for all other loans and presently are at 17 to 19 percent. However, through
various practices which have developed under the past conditions of limited
capital supply, effective costs to the borrowers are much higher: commercial
banks collect interest quarterly in advance from non-prime customer; for
prime companies interest is collected monthly in advance. Compensating
balances are, in effect, established by implicit understandings between
banks and borrowers that the latter would maintain a predetermined level of
demand deposits. Both these measures add about 5% to the effective cost to
1/   Depending on maturity.
2/   The foreign exchange risk against the USS averaged 6.7% p.a. over the
last 10 years.

the borrower. Finally the most stringent requirement is the opening of
installment savings accounts which are used both as collateral and sinking
funds and which can bring the effective cost of the loan up to 35% p.a.
Thus, while one may argue that a large number of loans receives prefer-
ential interest rates, a remark which questions the basic incentives
policy of the Government, it appears that the real level of interest rates
for general loans, allowing for a 10% inflation rate, has been highly
positive.

Operations
2.          The KDB will carry out its operations in accordance with sound
management and banking principles and practices. It shall endeavour to
specialize in extending capital funds to such industries as are designated
by the Government's economic plans or decrees as priority industries as
well as other major basic industries which form the sub-structure of the
economy. KDB may also make equity investments, provide working capital
loans and render managerial and technical assistance to its Borrowers when
the need arises. KDB will also extend guarantees on behalf of client en-
terprises. KDB, however, will not compete with other financial insitutions
in lending and administering industrial funds to assist major industries.
Project Selection
3.          It will finance enterprises which are soundly managed and which
appear, on careful economic, financial and engineering investigation to be
viable. Following sound banking practices, the projects will be analyzed
taking the following factors into consideration before making a commitment
of financial assistance:  (a) national economic benefits;  (b) technical
feasibility; (c) financial soundness and profitability; (d) marketability
and (e) quality of management.
Criteria for Selection of Borrowers
4.          In its operations, preference will be given to the following
major industries:
(a)    Generation, transmission and supply of electricity;
(b)    Coal-mining;
(c)    Ship-building;
(d)    Iron and steel manufacturing;

Foreign Exchange Risk
7.   -      As a general policy, KDB shall cover itself adequately against
foreign exchange risks in the conduct of its operations. However, in
using "revolving funds" generated in the case of some foreign borrowings,
KDB may assume the exchange risk temporarily. Also in using some funds
provided under the Industrial Rationalization Fund Scheme, KD.Ub may be exposed
to the exchange risk. To cover the risk in the latter case, KDB will make pro-
vision amounting to 1.5% of such funds outstanding from time to time. Exchange
losses exceeding the provision made by KDB, will be reimbursed by the Government.
Security Arrangements
8.   (a)    In accordance with normal business practices,
KDB will obtain adequate security for its loans
and guarantees. In extending a loan to an enter-
prise, KDB shall require such enterprise to provide
security the value of which shall be not less than
125% of the amount of the loan. In the case of
guarantees covered by a Government counter-guarantee
the value of security shall be not less than the
amount guaranteed, and in all other cases of guaran-
tees, shall be not less than 120% of the principal
amount covered under such guarantees.
(b)    KDB may waive any of the foregoing requirements in
cases where the credit or the guara-ntee is extended
in favor of those enterprises enunerated in para-
graph 2, Article 10 of the Operating Manuals of KDB
as of the date of this Policty Statement, provided,
however, that in such cases KD3 will endeavor to
secure a guarantee or counter-guarantee from the
Government of from a suitable bank or banks to cover
the credit or guarantee granted.

able to them constructive and remedial advice on the operation of the project..
When considered necessary, KDB will also dispatch its own staff to the project
companies.

to assist clients in the formulation and execution of their projects, KDB
will maintain an effective organization and an adequate staff, including
financial and economic analysis, engineering, accountancy, marketing and
legal services.

1/ Number of loans
2/ According to the standard banking practice in Korea, KDB credits its sub-borrowers' domestic currency loan accounts immediately
after making a commitment. Consequently domestic currency commitments are equal to disbursements in all the years. The amounts
not drawn down by the sub-borrowers from their respective loan accounts are shown under Credit Control Account' - a current
liability item. The outstanding balances under Credit Control Accounts as of the end of 1971 through 1975 were as follows:

ANNEX 12

KOREA DEVELOPMENT BANK
The Readjustment Corporation
Operations
1.          Establishment.  Establishment of the Readjustment Corporation
(RAC) as a juridical entity separate from the Korea Development Bank is
provided under Article 53-III of the Korea Development Bank Act. Follow-
ing enactment of the Readjustment Corporation Decree, RAC was set up in
April 1962 to (i) protect and collect claims taken over or transferred
to it by KDB and (ii) manage and dispose of properties taken over or
transferred to it by KDB (or such properties acquired by KIB as a result
of foreclosure). The share capital of RAC was wholly contributed by KDB
by transfer of claims and properties valued at W 565 million, title to
which was taken over by RAC as of the date of its establishment. No
increase in RAC's sharecapital has taken place since its establishment.
2.          Scope of operations.  While originally limited to the settle-
ment of accounts transferred by KDB, the scope of RAC's business was ex-
panded by Presidential Decree in 1966 to cover overdue loans of other
banking institutions as well. Title to properties and collateral is
transferred in full by KDB while claims of other banking institutions are
merely entrusted with RAC which acts as an agent for settlement and col-
lection of overdues. Transfers by KDB over the last five years amounted
to W 20.7 billion against W 61.2 billion for other banking institutions.
3.          Organization and staffing. RAC is managed by a President
and three Directors who are appointed by the Minister of Finance upon
recommendation by the Governor of KDB. RAC's President, Mr. Jae Il Kim,
is a former &xecutive Director of the Korea Trust Bank. Mr. Yong Mock
Cho is Director of the Transfer Operations Department in charge of settle-
ments and collection on KDB claims; Mr. Ho Taik Hyun, Director of the
Trust Collection Department in charge of collection of overdue loans
for other banking institutions who also supervises the Property Disposal
Department which disposes of foreclosed properties. Mr. Hang Suck Baik
supervises 3 departments; General Services, Planning and Research, and
Security Control. Two auditors are nominated by the Minister of Finance
to control and audit the operations of RAC. In 1963 RAC opened a branch
office in Busan to collect overdue loans in the Busan/Taegu area. This
branch now has a staff of 21 persons. RAC currently has a total staff
of 152 persons, 53 of which can be considered as professionals 1/ (only
3 of them are former employees of KDB).
4.          Procedures.  Voluntary repayments by debtors account for ap-
proximately 15% of settlements every year. In all other cases, court
action is undertaken and the mortgaged properties are sold at a public
auction by authority of the court. The opening price for bids is based
on an independent appraisal by the Korea Appraisal Board (KAB). After
bid-awardring by the court, the proceeds from the payment of the auctioned
price are allocated to the creditors ir.cluding RAC. RAC may participate
directly in the biddings if (i) the offering price based on KAB's ap-
1/ Defined as including and above Deputy Manager level.



ANNEX 12
Page 2
praisal is lower than RAC's claims or (ii) the offering price is
reduced by court to the level of RAC's claim. RAC thereby acquires
owrership of the properties which are subsequently sold by its Property
Disposal Departmert when a sale can be made at a reasonable price.
Such sales are usually made on an average 4 to 5 years installment
payment basis, with interest ranging from 0% to 15.5% on the unpaid
balance.
5.   -      Income.  KDB's claims consist of the outstanding principal
amount plus interest accrued to the date of transfer of the account to
RAC. Thereafter accruing interest constitutes RAC's income. For over-
due loans entrusted by other banking institutions RAC charges a fee
fixed by agreement between RAC and the Bankers Association. Income
also arises from the disposal of properties transferred by KDB for
which RAC receives the title at the time of transfer. If proceeds
received through foreclosure or disposal of properties are insufficient
to cover outstanding claims, loans must be written off by KDB or the
institution concerned. During the following 10 year period RAC is
legally authorized to attempt to make further recoveries. RAC receives
10% commission on such collections. In terms of the KDB Act, RAC is
exempt from income tax and the net profit is to be set aside as a reserve
for possible losses. RACts profitability has increased markedly over
the last 3 years as compared to the 1970-72 period. However, accounts
transferred or entrusted have decreased rapidly over the last 5 years
(see table 1, attached) and RZAC's income from KDB transfers has been
substantially reduced in 1975 fron its 1974 level. The summarized
accounts of RAC for the years 1971 through 1975 appear in table 2
attached to this annex 1/.
6.          Audit and supervision.  RAC is not legally required to have
its accounts audited by independent external auditors; the two internal
auditors appointed by the Minister of Finance are in charge of the
general audit of RAC's business operations. Financial statements are
prepared yearly and submitted to the Ministry of Finance which also
supervises the general operatilons of RAC. Moreover RAC must submit
monthly reports on the progress of collections to the Superintendent
of Banks.
RAC's Operations on Behalf of KDB
7.          Performance.  KDEB's cumulative transfers of overdue loans
to the end.of 1975 amounted to W 28.2 billion; in addition, transferred
properties amounted to W 4L5 million. RAC's performance in settling
and collecting these overdues is summarized below.
1/ Unaudited accounts based on Korean accounting standards for banking
institutions, i. e. income is reported on an actual receipt basis
and experses on accrual basis thus understating income and retained
earnings.

Total unsettled                           4,604          3
Overall, RAG's performance has been satisfactory; 63% of the accounts
transferred by KDB had been settled by the end of 1975; write offs by
KDB of unrecoverable claims represented 21% of cumulative transfers and
unsettled accounts 16% only.
8.        Transferred loans.  Table 1 attached to this annex shows that
in spite of the growth in KDB's loan portfolio, unsettled claims outstand-
ing with RAC at the end of 1975 stood at W 4.6 billion or 31% of their
1972 level. A particularly high level of settlements and write offs
was responsible for the sharp decrease in 1973 but marginal improvements
were also registered in the last two years as the level of settlements
exceeded that of new transfers. The W 4.6 billion outstanding at end
1975 represented RAC's claims over 46 companies 2/. All these companies
belonged to the private sector and showed a distribution among different
sectors broadly in line with the distribution of KDB's loan portfolio.
Against its claims, RAG held collateral on fixed assets valued at W 1.6
billion or 35% of its unsettled claims. However, past experience shows
that RAC had done very well in collecting payments from personal guar-
antees or through the sale of properties acquired at auctions; RAC is
confident that unsettled claims at end 1975 are fully recoverable. Con-
sequently KDB's write offs in 1975 amounted to W 140 million only.
9.        Guarantees. Unlike the transfer of loans, when overdue guar-
antees are transferred by KDB, RAC acts only as an agent and the accounts
entrusted to RAC for recovery still appear in KDB's guarantee portfolio.
As of December 31, 1975, out of a portfolio of 116 companies 2/, guaran-
tees to 4 companies had been entrusted to RAC for a total amount of
W 481 million. Two accounts had already been settled and were being col-
lected leaving an unsettled balance of W 242 million against which the
value of collateral available exceeded W 1.3 billion.
I/ Includes W 1,693 million of principal and W 231 million of recoverable
expenses.
/ Which compares with 41 companies in 1973 and 44 in 1974 but with larger
overdue amounts.
/ Amounting to W 1,480 billion.

Leasing Business in Korea
1.             Legal Framework.  In December 1973 the Government promulgated
the "Law on Promotion of Leasing Industries" designed to encourage the devel-
opment and growth of leasing in Korea. Under the law leasing companies have
to obtain a license from the Ministry of Finance, which also is the supervising
authority, and to have an authorized share capital of at least W 3 billion.
Leasing companies are accorded some privileges including exceptions to other
laws such as the Customs, Foreign Trade Transactions or Maritime Transportation
Laws. For instance, equipment imported for lease by a leasing company receives
the same preferential tariff concession under the customs law that apply to
imported equipment used for the purposes described by the law. The law also
specifies the interest to be charged on loans by indicating maximum spreads
allowed to be added to fund raising costs. The maximum spreads allowed under
the law have recently been increased and are presently as follows (previous
rates in bracket):
domestic currency leases:          4%    (3%)
foreign currency leases:          5%    (3%)
subleases of imported equipment  5%    (maximum interest
of 15.5%)
Leases can principally be written on full payout or partial pay-out basis.
Because uncertainty existed as to whether the Korean Tax authorities might
consider full pay-out leases as installment sales contracts, in fact, no full
pay-out leases have been written in Korea since 1973 until recently, when the
Ministry of Finance announced its decision explicitly allowing full pay-out
leases.   Hence in the future most leases written in Korea will likely be on
that basis.
2.             Present Set-Up.  Leasing business was introduced into Korea in
1972 when KILC was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of KDB. In early
1975 two more leasing companies were established; Korea Development Leasing
Company (KDLC) with KDFC (37%) and Oriental Leasing Company of Japan (35%) being
the largest shareholders, and Whashin Tiger Leasing Company 'WTLC), a joint
venture between Whashin Industrial Company of Korea (51%) and Tiger Leasing
Company of the USA (49%). According to industry sources it is unlikely that
additional leasing companies will be established in the near future. Merchant
banks on the other hand, which under the M4erchant Banking Act are allowed to do
leasing business are not expected to take part to any significant extent in
lepsing operations for some time to come since the main purpose of their estab-
lishment would be to raise foreign funds for onlending to private industrial
enterprises. As of today no merchant bank has been formed.

3.             The volume of contracts written by the Yorean cornpanies between
1973 and 1975 was as Lollows:
1973          1974           1975
KILC                          1,086          4,081          3,153
KDLC                                                          663
TWTLC                                                         200
TOTAL                   1.086           -081            016
As shown above, KILC's contracts increased sharply in 1974., reflecting the strong
demand for lease financing as recognition and understanding of lease financing by
private enterprises gradually increased. In 1975, however, KILC's lease contracts
fell, which was the result of shortage of financial resources at its disposal.
(see para. 16). KDLC and WTLC accounted for 21% of total contracts written and
their relative share in the market may increase in the future.
4.             Advantages/Disadvantages of Leasing in Korea. There is a chronic
shortage of medium and long-term capital in the private manufacturing sector in
Korea, with enterprises already having high debt/equity ratios. Leasing broadens
the pool of capital available by enabling the companies to get maximum leaverage
out of a limited equity base. Moreover leasing frees funds originally earmarked
for fixed assets for working capital, where there is also a shortage. Furthermore
since leasing companies do not usually require collateral for lease financing in
contrast to banks, business firms whose property has already been pledged in full
for security of existing bank loans are able to obtain additional capital goods.
This may be vital especially to rapidly exp-anding medium-and small sized companies
whose continuous growth is checked by their limited available collateral needed
for obtaining additional bank loans. While well capitalized companies could get
unsecured loans, these are seldom available for smaller companies. Leasing,
therefore, could be particularly beneficial to the medium-and small segment of
Korean manufacturing enterprises.
5.             On the negative side, the cost of leasing is usually higher than
the interest on regular loans. Also high initial depreciation allowances as well
as investment tax credits cannot be availed as they do not apply to leased equip-
ment. For the leasing companies, there exists the risk of unused lease items,
after expiration of the lease, the sale of which may be uncertain.
6.             Prospects of the Korean Leasing Industry.  The outlook for the
Korean leasing industry is favorable. As described in the previous paragraphs,
leasing is an attractive form of financing for many Korean enterprises because
of their already high debt/equity ratios and the often limited available collateral
needed for obtaining additional bank loans. Moreover, there is a general supplier's
market for any type of long-term finance in Korea. Marketing efforts of the
leasing companies therefore are, and will probably continue to be, directed towards
educating potential lessees rather than finding them. Another indicator of the



ANNEX 13
Page 3
potential of the leasing market in Korea is given by a comparison with Japan
where the share of lease financing in total investment is over four times the
current level in Korea. Consequently, the factor which probably will be most
restrictive to the growth of leasing in Korea is the leasing companies' fund
raising capacity as is also documented by the decline in the volume of leases
written in Korea during 1975 despite a long pipeline of applications at the
leasing companies. Since borrowing on the domestic market will continue to be
very limited due to the unavailability and/or high cost of long term funds, the
future growth of the Korean leasing industry therefore will largely depend on
the successful resource mobilization abroad which the parent companies will be
able to arrange for the three leasing companies over the next few years.
KILC - Institutional Set-Up.
7.             Articles of Incorporation, Capital and Ownership. KILC was
incorporated in December 1972, with an initial authorized share capital of
W 300 million, which was fully paid in by its single shareholder, KDB. According
to the Articles of Incorporation KILC shall make long term leases of a broad
variety of facilities, machines and tools, shall extend guarantees relevant to
long term lease for such items and perform any related business. KIIC started
its operations in March 1973 and in December of that year formally received its
license when the Korea Leasing Promotion Law was promulgated. KDB's authorized
capital has been increased in three stages to the present W 3 billion &f which
50% has been paid in,all by KDB.
8.             Objectives and Policies. KIIC's perations are governed by its
Articles of Incorporation, its Operating Manual_ and its Guidelines for Leasing.
According to the Guidelines, set up by KIIL's Board, KILC will give priority to
fostering small and medium scale enterprises and such projects that will have great
impact on employement creation. Industrywise it will concentrate on leasing to
export oriented, import substitution and health industries, industries for the
development of natural resources and for the production of essential goods and other
industries encouraged by the Government (machinery, computer, cargo vessel, etc.).
"Finance prudence" limits are contained in KILC's Operating Manuals.  These limits
are: a) unpaid leases plus borrowings should not exceed 20 times KILC's equity,
and b) uncollected lease rentals to one company should not exceed (i) W 1 billion,
(ii) 10 times the equity of the lessee and (iii) 50% of KILC's equity.
9.             Organization, Management and Staff. KILO is managed by a Board
of Directors, including its President and three Executive Directors. It has four
departments, Planning, General Affairs and two Operations Departments. KILC has
no branches but plans to open one in Busan in 1977. KILC has a staff of 42, 13 of
whon can be considered professional. Mr. Lee, the President, is an experienced,
well regarded banker, who made his career in KDB which he left as Executive Director
at the end of 1974 to join KILC. Mr. Lee provides able leadership to his company.
The present members of the Board and their background is given in Appendix 2.
1/  Some of the more important articles are given in Appendix 1.



ANNEX 13
aige 4
10.            Procedures.  KILC's appraisal criteria are laid down in its
Guidelines for Leasing. The appraisals usually cover all important aspects
of a project with main emphasis being placed on the financial strength and
debt servicing capacity of the client. For the purpose of its credit evaluation,
KILC has developed a Credit Evaluation Table which divides the clients into
four groups depending on an elaborate points system whereby the applicant is
awarded between one and five points for fifteen different criteria such as
current ratio, debt/equity ratio, profitability ratio (client versus etandard
competitors ratio), capacity utilization, export performance, managerial and
technical capabilities and prospects. If an applicant falls into one of the
two lower groups KILC turns down the application or requires security from the
applicant. KILC also makes a check of the leasing item, whether it is acceptable
for leasing, whether purchase conditions are acceptable and, in particular,
whether the machinery could also be procured locally.
Operations
11.            Since its inception in 1973, until the end of 1975, KTIa  has
written 75 lease contracts totalling W 8.3 billion and guaranteed three lease
contracts for imported equipment for US$ 2.6 million. As mentianed in paragraph
3, KILC expanded fastest in 1974 when its resource position was relatively strong
and demand brisk while in 1975 business was curtailed due to the severe resource
constraints (see paragraph 16). For 59 of KILC's lease contracts, equipment had
been delivered by December 31, 1975 accounting for W 7.0 billion (84% of contract
amounts written) of total commitments. The largest share of contracts, 42 of
the 59, has gone to the manufacturing sector (W 4.2 billion) including cement, can
production, textiles and printing. The other industries in KILC's portfolio are:
transportration (mainly shipping - 5 contracts for W 2.4 billion), hospitals (9
contracts for W 421 million) and mining (3 contracts for W 21 million). The average
size of a contract was W 119 million, ranging from W 890 million for a vessel to
w 4 million for office equipment. Lease periods varied between 3 to 10 years
with the majority between six and eight years. Of the total equipment delivered,
28% was locally procured. In the past,KILC has signed lease contracts with both
large and small enterprises with the largest being a synthetic textiles manufacturer
with total fixed assets of US$ 51.5 million and the smallest a bolt and nuts manu-
facturing shop (US$ 37,000). The three lease guarantees were all signed for used
ship leases abroad. The guarantees were given for periods between 5 and 8 years
and KILC collected guarantee commissions of about 5% of the guaranteed values.
Financial Position and Profitability
12.            Lease Accounting.  There are two methods by which a leasing company
may prepare financial reports. One is to treat the leased equipment as a fixed
asset, which is generally called the "Operating Method". Under this method, a lessor
records on its balance sheet the leased equipment at cost and then depreciates the
equipment over the estimated useful life. To determine operating results, lease
fees received durirga fiscal year are measured against the year's depreciation
costs. The other method is the "Financing Methods", under which the lessor carries
the lease receivables as its assets and deducts unearned income from the receivables
or treats the unearned lease income as a liability. The unearned lease income,



ANNEX 13
Page 5
representing the excess of the lease receivables over the cost of the leased
equipment excluding its estimated residual value, is recognized as revenue over
the lease period. There is no notion of depreciation in the Financing Method.
13.            The Operating Method is much more conservative as the depreciation
cost during the first two or three years accounts for a high proportion of the
level payments by the lessee thereby reducing the recognized profit during the
initial years. KILC prepares financial statements following both methods: the
Operating Method is required by Korean tax regulation while the Financing Method
is used for managerial purposes.
114.           Financial Position.  Appendices 3 and 4 summarize KILC's financial
statements for the past three years, giving also a comparison of the two accounting
methods for the year 1975. Based on the operating method KILC had total assets of
W 8.0 billion as of December 31, 1975, 92% of which were in the form of leased
equipment and other fixed assets. Deferred accounts of W 176 million represent
capitalized foreign exchange losses which KILC suffered during the 1974 devaluation
of the Won and which will be written off over a five year period. KILC will not
suffer such foreign exchange losses in the future since it now borrows from KDB
only in domestic currency without value maintenance clause.
15.            To finance its assets KILC borrowed from KDB W 6.1 billion and used
its equity which, incl Ving accumulated losses for the first three years of opera-
tions of W 250 million- stood at W 1.3 billion. Liabilities include also W 532
million of long term deposits representing deposits equivalent to 3 months lease
rentals whi4 the lessees, as is usual in Korea, have to maintain with the lessor.
KILC's debt- /equity ratio stood at 6.4 to 1, well within its statutory limit of
20 to 1 and its current ratio at the end of 1975 was 5.3 to 1.
16.            Profitability.  During the three yeers of operations, KI-LC suffered
a total loss of W 250 million. The annual loss dropped from W 153 million in 1974
to W 81 million in 1975 or from 5.5% of average total assets to 1.3% of average
total assets. Using the Financing Method of accounting KILC made a small profit of
W 43 million in 1975 and for its three years of operations just about broke even
with a small total cumulative loss of W 3 million.  More than half of KILC's loss
in 1975 was due to the extraordinary expense of W 44 million for the foreign exchange
loss suffered in 1974 (see para. 13). Duiring 1975 KILC's average borrowing cost was
7.6%, its average lease income (excluding average depreciation charge of 9.5%) was
10.3%. Administrative cost was 5.1% of average total assets, close to half of it for
personnel expenses, compared to 5.3% in 1974 and 7.7% in 1973. Administrative ex-
penses as a percentage of assets should decline in the future as the assets base is
enlarged. Up to now KILC has not made any provisions since it has not shown profits
so far and because there has been no default.
1/ Using the financing method KILC is close to breaking even, having accumulated
losses of W 2.6 million.
2/ Includes guarantees of W 1.2 billion.



ANMUX 13
17.            Audit. KILC's accounts are audited by internal auditors as is
usual in Korea. No external audit of its books has been performed to date.
During negotiations agreement should be reached that KILC will appoint, for
its future annual audits, external auditors, acceptable to the Bank.
18.            Resources.  As of December 31, 1975 KILC's long-term resource-
position was as follows:
Won in million
Paid in capital                    1,500
Accumulated losses                   250
Total equity                     1,250               15.9
Long-term loans from KDB           6,068               77.3
Deposits                                                6.8
Total resources                  7,850             lOOQ0
Less disbursenents                 7,287
Available for disbursements          5-63
Less undisbursed commitments       1,03
Shortfall in resources            t47)
As can be seen KILC's resource position was very tight towards the end of 1975
which was mainly due to KDB's own severe resource shortage.  Borrowings from
other sources was more or less out of the question because funds of the right
maturities were either not available domestically, or only at a very high cost,
and because KILC has not established an operational record that would have allowed
it to raise funds from commercial sources abroad. The resource shortfall on a
commitment basis of W 470 million will be met through further borrowings fromT KDB
which for 1976 has already committed W 2.5 billion of its own resources to KILC.
19.            KILC has basically relied on two sources of .inance:  KDB and
deposits of its clients. KDB accounted for 93% of total resources at the end of
1975 which it has contributed in the form of equity (W 1,250 million net of losses
or 15.9% of total resources) and long term loans (W 6,068 nillion or 77.3% of total
resources) which it has extended to KILC since 1973 at an interest rate of 12/% p.a.
with a maturity of 12 years including a 4-year grace period. Deposits of its clients
amounted to W 532 million (6.8% of resources) at the end of 1975. As is comnon in
Korea, lessees have to deposit with lessors an amount corresponding to three months
lease fees at the time of lease contract. Such deposits do not carry any interest.
KILC does not carry the exchange risk on loans it has made from past borrowings fromn
KDB by including value maintenance clauses in its own leases and new loans from KDB
are made on a straight Won basis. On the proposed Bank loan through KD3, KILC would
also pass on the exchange risk to the lessees.

KILC's Prospects
20.           Operational Forecast.  In line with the general prospects of the
leasing industry in Korea, KILC's outlook is favorable. Based on its borrowing
program over the next three years, KILC projects the following business volume
(in Won million or equivalent):
Contract Amounts
In Domestic       In Foreign
Currency          Currency      Total
1975 (actual)        3,153                -        3,153
1976                 3,300              2,700       6,000
1977                 3,300              3,900       7,200
1978                 3,400              5,200      8,600
The almost doubling of lease contracts written in 1976 over 1975
is due to the depressed volume of business during 1975 when KILC was unable to
raise additional resources. After 1976, the growth rate is conservatively pro-
jected at 20% p.a. again being dependent on resources availability rather than
business opportunities.
21.           Resources.  To finance the leases, KILC hopes to obtain, between 1976
and 1978, loans from KDB (W 4.4 billion) and from sources abroad (W 10.1 billion
equivalent), namely the proposed Bank loan through KDB (US$7.5 million) and foreign
commercial sources (US$13.4 million). KILC in fact plans to rely increasingly on
such foreign commercial borrowings which it would make through the merchant bank
KDB is about to estabTish.  The remaining funds (W 7.3 billion) are expected to come
from lease payments li (W 5.8 billion), lessees deposits (W 1.4 billion) and a
capital increase which is planned for 1977, when KDB hopes to open KILC to foreign
investors.
22.           Financial Projections.  KILC's total assets are expected to increase
over three times during the next three years, based on the rapid increase in its
operations, and are estimated to amount to W 24.8 billion at the end of 1978. At
that time fixed assets for lease will account for 96% of total assets. Liabilities
will increase from W 6.7 billion at the end of 1975 to W 21.8 billion at the end of
1978. Most of the liabilities will be in the form of borrowings from KDB (W 19.6
billion or 90%) and lessees' deposits (W 1.9 billion or 9%). As of December 31,
1978, KILC is expected to show, for the first time, retained earnings of W 37 million
which will bring total equity to W ,036 million, after the paid-in capital will have
been doubled in 1977. KILC's debtL! /equity ratio will rise to 9.3 to 1 in 1978 and
the current ratio will be above 4.4 to 1 at all times. KILC will make profits
starting in 1976, rising from W 63 million to W 320 million over the projection period.
KILC's overall spread is expected to remain constant while administrative expenses as
percentage of total assets will decrease from 5.5% in 1975 to 1.6% in 1978 as the
assets base in 1978 will have sharply increased. In 1978 KILC will begin paying taxes
on its income and plans on paying out dividends equivalent to 50% of its net income
after taxes. This dividend policy is thought to be necessary to attract private
investors for the planned 1977 capital increase.
1/ The loans from KDB have a much longer repayment period than KILC's average lease
terms, and include a 4-year grace period. Therefore KILC will be able to relend,
at least during the projected period, the major share of its collections.
2/ Including guarantees and subleases.

Increases from variations in the foreign exchanges rates arise because of KDB's policy to adjust the recorded value of foreign currency guarantees only at
the time a transaction occurs in respect of specific guarantees.

term resources of W818.5 billion (US$1.7 billion) of which W652.2 billion (79.7%)
were in domestic currency and W166.2 billion (20.3%) in foreign currency. Below

2.          Paid in Capital.  KDB's authorized capital is W300 billion
of which 67.7% (W203.2 billion) had been paid in as at the end of 1975,
all of which is subscribed by the Government of Korea, as is provided
in KDB's Act. Since 1971 KDB's capital has been increased by i148.7
billion or 370%. In 1972 the Government more than doubled the paid in
capital (from W54.5 billion to W110.l billion) to help KDB carry out the
August 1972 Emergency Decree and it further increased the paid in capital
by 70% in 1975 (from W119.7 billion to W 203.2 billion>,   The Government
makes capital contributions basically in three forms: through cash
contributions, conversion of loans and transfer of shares in Government-
owned enterprises. Total capital increases between 1971 and 1975 were made
as follows:
Won in million
Cash contributions                       73,376           .3
Loan conversions                         20,000          13.4
Share transfers                          55,359          37.3
Total capital increase                                100.0
3.          Loan conversions were all made during 1975, on account of loans
given by the Government to KDB between 1965 and 1974 at a rate of 6% p.a.
with terms of 35 years including five year grace period. Most of the Share
Transfers were also made during 1975 (W 50.0 billion) when the Government was
unable to make cash contributions due to tight budgetary position. During
1976, the Government plans to increase KDB's paid in capital by an additional
amount of W21.7 billion.
h.          Reserves and Retained Eamrings:  In accordance with the KDB Act,
net income is credited to legal reserves; KDB does not pay income/corporate
tax and also is not required to pay any dividends to the Government. The Act
also provides that net-losses incurred during any year should be charged
against legal reserves and if total losses should exceed this amount, the
Government shall cover such deficiency. In 1961, the Government made a special
cash contribution of Wl.5 billion for establishing a Special Reserve to be
charged with any losses resulting from loans made prior to December 27, 1961
and from KDB's investment in the Readjustment Corporation (see Annex 12). So
far, KDB has made only minor write-offs against these Special Reserves amounting
to W6.6 million. As of December 31, 1975, KDB's reserves and retained earnings
were shown as follows (in million Won):
Legal Reserves                   34,913
Special Reserves                  1,493
Net income for the year          14.121
Total                          50.527
Legal reserves (and equity) as stated above are, in fact, overstated because
provisions for doubtful loans amounting to W3.6 billion -ire also included and
treated as part of KDB's equity.



ANNEX 18

5.           Borrowings from Government.  Borrowings from the Government
have been an important source of funds for KDB. Its reliance on this source
has somewhat diminished in recent years, however, particularly since KDB can
draw on substantial funds from the NIF (see para 10). As of December 31, 1975
borrowings from the Government accounted for 19% of total resources (down from
33% in 1971). The Government makes loans to KDB from three sources: the
Economic Development Fund, the Foreign Loan Repayment Fund and AID-Counter-
part Fund. As of December 31, 1975, the contribution from each fund was as
follows (in million Won):
Economic Development Fund            133,726
Foreign Loan Repayment Fund              152
AID Counterpart Fund                  15,196
Total                              1492074
Loans from the Foreign Loai Repayment Fund will be fully repaid by KDB during
1976. The Government had made these loans out of grants received from abroad
or out of counterpart-funds created through early repayment of official loans
from abroad by various Government Agencies. The AID Counterpart Fund was also
created likewise and loans were originally given to KDB for making equipment
loans to government projects. Interest rates on AID counterpart fund borrowings
range from 2% to 5% p.a. with the weighted average rate being 2.4%; repayment
terms were 10 to 35 years with the latest repayments by KDB falling due in the
year 2007. During the past five years the Government has not made any new loans
from the AID Counterpart Fund to KDB.
6.           The Economic Development Fund represents the Government's own
general funds and allocations to KDB are usually made for pre-identified projects.
The interest rate charged by the Government varies between 6% and 13.5% with a
weighted average rate of 6.1% as of December 31, 1975. Repayment ranges from 5
to 35 years with grace periods of up to 5 years.
7.           Industrial Rationalization Fund.  This fund was created in KDB under
the Emergency Decree of August 1972 for providing financial assistance on favorable
terms (8% p.a. interest for up to eight years with 3 years grace period) for the
rationalization and development of priority industries such as basic industries
or machinery and export industries. The IRF is administered by KDB within the
broad policy guidelines formulated and laid down by the IRF Council which is under
the control of the Prime Minister and comprises 4 officially appointed members plus
the Governors of KDB and Bank of Korea and the Presidents of Korea Institute of
Science and Technology and Korea Development Institute. Investment decisions on
specific sub-projects are taken by KDB on the basis of its appraisal of each sub-
project.
8.           As of December 31, 1975 borrowings from the IRF amounted to W66.6
billion. The resources of the IRF consist of borrowings from the Government
(W51.1 billion or 76.7%) and issuance of IFD's (W15.5 billion or 23.3%). Although
no further borrowings from the IRF are envisaged at present, KDB will be able to
continue to extend IRF loans to the extent that collections from its clients will
exceed the repayments it has to make to the Government. The Government has lent



ANNEX 18
Page 4
funds to the IRF from PL-480 Funds (tallow imports), USAID Counterpart Funds
and its direct borrowings for this purpose from the OECF and the Ex-Im Bank,
both of Japan. These borrowings carry interest rates of 2% - 5% p.a. and have
long repayment periods (15 to 40 years including grace periods ranging from
5 to 10 years). They have a "Dollar/Yen value maintenance clause" and therefore
entail an exchange risk for KDB. To guard against the exchange risk, KDB has
to make special provisions in the amount of 1.5% of the average outstanding
borrowings under the IRF. Losses due to exchange rate fluctuations in excess
of this reserve are to be met by the Government of Korea. IFD's issued by KDB
under the IRF are identical to its regular IFD's (see para 12).
9.           Tourism Development Fund.  Loans from theTDF have been provided
to KDB by the Ministry of Transportation for financing of tourism projects
such as hotels, etc. The total borrowings from the TDF amounted to W380 million
and no further increase is expected. KDB pays 6% interest p.a. on these funds
which it has relent at 7.5%. The repayment term is 10 years including a two year
grace period.
10.          National Investment Fund.  On January 1, 1974 the Government insti-
tuted the NIF with the main purpose of improving the flow of domestic savings
into investments in heavy and chemical industries. The NIF is under the juris-
diction of the Ministry of Finance and is in effect managed by the Bank of Korea.
Policy decisions are taken by the NIF Management Council comprising the Prime
Minister and the ministers of eight ministries, the Governors of BoK and KDB
and three other members appointed by the Government. The Council also de-
cides on operational and managerial criteria and prepares an annual Supply and
Oierations Programs which indicates the supply and uses (by industrial sector)
of the Fund. The NIF derives its funds from (a) direct Government contributions,
(b) the sale of NIF-Bonds to National Savings Associations, the newly set up
National Welfare Pension Fund System, Postal Insurance ardTrust Companies and
public funds designated by special Presidential Decree and (c) from repayments
of loans. Although the main emphasis in lending is given to heavy and chemical
industries, loans are also extended to the power sector, agricultural production,
Saemaul factories and for export financing.

The NIF lends available funds to banking institutions which, as intermediaries,
receive the applications for eligible projects and perform appraisal and super-
vision functions. Presently banking institutions pay 10.5% on their borrowings
from the NIF and receive a spread of 1.5% on their relending. Repayment schedules
are synchronized and are for periods of 8 years (equipment loans) and up to 3
years (working capital loans).
11.        KDB receives its allocations from the NIF on an annual basis, but
actual disbursements are linked with disbursements for individual subprojects.
To a certain extent KDB is free to select the borrowers from among the industries
specified in its annual NIF program but has also specific projects allocated to
it by the NIF Council. In such cases it usually approves the loans after checking
the compliance of the project proposal with the NIF selection criteria (soundness
of financial structure, appropriateness of size of loan, maturity, repayment
prospects and project and funding plan) making suggestions of changes, where
appropriate. Loans for projects earmarked by the NIF Council amounted to W 53.7
billion in 1975 (67% of total allocations) including W 43.2 billion (54% of total
allocations) for KECO. Outstanding loans under the NIF (net of repayments)
amounted to W 116.8 billion or 20% of KDB's total portfolio. Since its inception,
the NIF gradually has become KDB's most important source of funds and is likely
to further increase its share in KDB's total resources. In its operational pro-
gram for 1976, for instance, XDB expects the NIF to account for about 50% of
total financing of its loan commitments.
12.        Industrial Finance Debentures.  In terms of its Act, KDB is the
only institution in Korea that can issue IFD's.  Repayment of IFD's is secured
by Government guarantee and, therefore, prior approval of the National Assembly
is required before IFD's can be issued by KDB. At the end of 1975 KDB had
outstanding IFD's amounting to W 68.5 billion (w 15.5 billion of which were on
account of IRF), which were subscribed by local banks (27%) and the general
public (73%). Duration of IFD's is between two and five years; since 1973 EDB
has issued IFD's with two and three year maturities only (in the ratio of about
3:1).  IFD's are presently issued at an interest rate of 12.4% and 13.2%, de-
pending on duration, but because interest is payable in advance, the effective
cost to KDB is between 18% and 20%. Since KDB's maximum lending rate is 15.5%
p.a., it issues the IFD's, in effect, at a negative margin. The losses incurred
during 1975, for instance, amounted to W 1.2 billion but because KDB receives compen-
sation from the Government for losses on loans to Government designated projects
(such compensation totalled W 198 million in 1975), the net loss it suffered
amounted to W 1.0 billion. Assuming that KDB, as it has stated, will issue new
IFD's only to the extent of redemption of old ones, the annual loss suffered by
KDB will still continue to be sizeable. During negotiations KDB's policy of
rolling over its IFD portfolio should be discussed to ascertain whether it can
afford to let its outstanding IFD's decline gradually at least until it can issue
them at a positive spread.

13e        Revolving Funds. USAID and KfW foreign currency loans have
fixed repayment schedules with final due dates between 1980 and 2003. KDB's
collections from sub-loans exceeding its own repayment obligation are pooled
in two separate funds - AID Revolving Fund and KtV Revolving Fund - and are
subsequently used to finance new domestic currency loans. In making these
second round loans, KDB passes on the exchange risk to the borrower through
a 'Dollar/Deutsche Mark value maintenance clause". Since KDB is exposed to
the foreign exchange risk between the time it receives collections and makes
disbursements on second round loans, it jUdiciously manages these funds so as
to reduce the time gap to a minimum. Of the total outstanding funds as of
December 31, 1975 of W 4.1 billion, W 475 million (or U%1) were still unused.
KDB protects itself against foreign exchange risk on this amount by keeping
adequate deposit balances in foreign currencies. Interest payable on revolving
fund loans is the same as on loans funded from foreign commercial sources
(presently 12% p.a.). The same technique is employed to guard against the exchange
risk involved in using the proceeds of commercial borrowings (see paragrpah 18).
14.        Deposits. According to its Act, KDB is authorized to accept time
deposits in domestic as well as foreign currency. While time deposits were an
important resource for KDB only as far back as 1971, when they accounted for
12% of total long term debt, they have dropped to an insignificant level of
w 115 million by the end of 1975 as the result of a 1974 policy decision by
KDB's management not to promote mobilization of deposits anymore because the
maturities of such deposits usually are only one year which does not suit KDB's
needs, and because KDB's branch net-work is too smaUl (9 branches) to have any
significant impact.
Foreign Currency Resources
l5.        Foreign Currency Lines of Credit.  KDB contracted its first foreign
currency borrowing from USAID in April 1960 in the form of a line of credit of
Us$ 5 million equivalent followed by two more lines of credit totalling US$ 22.4
million in 1966 and 1968. The loan obtained in 1960 has in the meantime been
fully repaid. In 1966 it also began borrowing from Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau
from Germany from which it has since received three loans totalling DM 40 million
(US$ 16.9 million). Both USAID and KfW loans are basically borrowings by the
Government of Korea which relends to KDB. Except for a small residual of the 3rd
KfW line of credit, all amounts have been fully committed, and as of December 31,
1975 outstanding loans from USAID and KfW amounted to W 11.1 billion. KDB pays
interest of 5% to 8%, relending at a spread of 2% to 4%; the most recent loans
from KfW (1970 and 1973) are at a 2% spread. Repayment schedules for all five loans
are fixed (10 to 30 years) and KDB can relend a part of the collections from
its sub-loans (see paragraph 13). KDB expects a fourth KfW loan of DM 20 million
later this year.

16.       KDB established its relationship with ADB in 1970 when it obtained
a line of credit of US$10 million. This was followed by three other lines
of credit in 1972, 1974 aAd 19751/ totalling US$90 million. In 1975 KDB and
ADB jointly appraised a project for which ADB provided W17.5 billion through
KDB. For its borrowings from ADB, KDB has paid varying interest rates ranging
from 7.5% to 8.75% and has onlent these funds with a spread of 2%. The exchange
risk on all ADB loans is born by the sub-borrower. While repayment schedules
for the first four loans are related to KDB's collections from the sub-loans, the
latest loan has a fixed repayment schedule (1978-1989) thereby allowing KDB
to "revolve" a part of its future collections.
17.       The World Bank made its first loan to KDB in 1975, in the amount of
US$60 million with repayment tied to collections from the sub-loans. The
loan carries interest at the rate of 8.5% to which KDB adds a 2% spread.
18.       Borrowings from Foreign Commercial Sources.  KDB obtained its first
Eurodollar loan of US$25 million in June 1970. This loan has been fully repaid
in 1975. In 1974, KDB again went to the Eurodollar market for a US$80 million
placement which was managed by four banks (Bankers Trust Company of London,
Citicorp International Bank, Ltd., London, Asia Pacific Capital Corporation,
Hong Kong and B. T. Finance Ltd. Hong Kong) and was subscribed by 38 banks from
Japan, U.K., USA, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada and Australia. The loan is re-
payable between 1977 and 1984 and carries a floating interest rate (LIBOR plus
1% - 7.75% as of March 31, 1976) which is fixed semi-annually. KDB onlends
these funds also at a floating rate which is fixed by its International Depart-
ment on the basis of averaRe cost of its commercial borrowinRs at floating rates
plus a mark-up and presently is set at 12%. KDB passes the exchange risk on to
its sub-borrowers (see paragraph 13). During 1976 KDB was able to obtain another
Eurodollar loan of US$80 million with a repayment period of 5 years at an interest
rate of 1.875% above LIBOR and i 5 billion (US$17 million) from a Japanese banking
consortium, repayable over 7 years including 2 years grace period, at 0.7% above
the Japanese prime rate.
19.       Industrial Finance Debentures.  In October 1974 KDB issued for the
first time IFD's in foreign currency for US$18.8 million to the Government of
Abu Dhabi. The Debentures are repayable over 9 years beginning 1980. The on-
lending rate is determined as described in paragraph 18 and the exchange risk
is also passed on to the sub-borrowers. On April 20, 1976, KDB signed another
agreement for the issuance of IFD's in Abu Dhabi, this time in the amount of
US$15 million. The interest rate for these debentures is 9.5% p.a. and they
are redeemable after 5 years (1981). In addition, in July, KDB issued US$10
million IFD's again in Abu Dhabi, at a rate of 9.25% p.a., which is repayable in
1979.
20.       Deposits.  KDB has received foreign currency deposits in the amount
of W 35.1 billion (W 18.0 billion from Korea Exchange Bank and W 17.1 million
from the Asia Pacific Capital Corporation, Hong Kong). These deposits are for 6

months to one year duration, with rollover feature. KDB originally had
intended to repay these deposits in 1974 and 1975. However, due to its
own resource constraints, it was unable to do so. KDB plans to reduce
these deposits by W 20 billion in 1976 and a further W 12 billion in 1977.
The deposit rates vary between  X  and 15 3/15 with the average rate at
about 11%. Onlending terms are the same as with Eurodollar loans described
in paragraph 18.
