IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
CREDIT N0 1805-BU
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Second
Telecommunications Project in Burundi, for which the Credit 1 805-BU in the amount of SDR
3.8 million (US$ 4.8 million equivalent) was approved on May 21, 1987 and made effective on
April 5, 1989.
The Credit was closed on June 30, 1996, compared with the original closing date
of December 31, 1993. Final disbursement took place on December 31, 1996, with 11 percent
of the credit undisbursed. Cofinancing for the Project was provided by CFD (France), the
Government of Netherlands and a Dutch commercial bank. Preparation of this ICR followed
cancellation of the credit in January 1997. It is based on material in the project file.
The ICR was prepared by Svetoslav Tintchev of the Telecommunications and
Informatics Division (IENTI) and Jean Boutan, Consultant, and reviewed by Paul Berminghan
of the Telecommunications and Informatics Division (IENTI), Francois Nankobogo of the
Country Operations Department (AFC09), and Chukwuma Obidegwu, Operations Support
Africa (AFTM3). The Borrower provided its contribution which is attached as an appendix to
the ICR.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
CREDIT No 1805-BU
Evaluation Summary
Background
1.        A first telecommunications project, financed by an IDA credit in the amount of US$ 7.7
million, approved in July 1980 and satisfactorily completed in 1987, helped ONATEL, the newly created
parastatal Office National des T6l6communications, to structure its organization, modernize the network
and expand it on a national scale. The second project, effective in April 1989, was designed to assist
ONATEL in strengthening its management and organization and continuing its development program of
about US$ 25.4 million, in coordination with other lenders. IDA's credit in the amount of US$ 4.8 million
equivalent also financed a postal component as the Government wished to improve its postal services
facilities and build a postal sorting center.
Project objectives and description
2.        The sector objectives at the start of the program were to strengthen further ONATEL's ability
to: (a) increase operational efficiency and quality of service; (b) ensure that revenues would cover
operating costs and contribute significantly to investments; (c) generate tax revenues for Government; (d)
extend services to rural areas; and (e) expand facilities to meet expressed demand. The Government also
wished to establish a postal sector structure and an efficient postal enterprise and accordingly decided to
establish a semi-autonomous entity, Regie nationale des postes (RNP), with its own administrative
organization. A comprehensive program of technical assistance to ONATEL, provided by CFD, the
Netherlands Government and IDA, including training and some computing equipment, and amounting to
245 staff months (60 staff months for IDA), was devised to address those objectives.
3.        The project concept was consistent with the traditional monopolistic approach to public
utilities which prevailed at that time, at least in the case of small networks. However, near the end of the
protracted implementation period, a dialogue started between the Bank and the sector authorities with a
view to broadening substantially the original objectives and was leading to the firm determination of
sector policy objectives and a new policy approach to sector issues, in line with current worldwide trends.
4.        To meet the sector objectives, the program designed by the co-financers on the basis of
ONATEL's medium term development plan included the following physical objectives: (a) replacement
and expansion of switching and distribution facilities in Bujumbura, for a total capacity of 13,800 main
lines; (b) installation of a new international transit exchange and satellite earth station; (c) a rural-multi
access radio link in rural areas; and (d) maintenance vehicles and equipment. The project also included a
physical component for postal services, including the construction of a parcel sorting center and the
provision of equipment. At the same time, it was decided that the program would redress ONATEL's
main management inadequacies by: (a) strengthening accounting and financial systems; (b) improving
staff training, particularly for high level staff and non-engineers; and (c) improving the reliability and
capacity of local, long distance and international telephone facilities.



Project Achievements and Results
5.        Organization and institutional development. With technical assistance, ONATEL's structure
was much improved in its accounting and operating organization. However, an action plan, prepared in
1992 for ONATEL's reorganization and the creation of an information system, pointed out remaining
deficiencies which would be corrected later. A satisfactory postal accounting organization was also set up
with Technical Assistance.
6.        In 1992, MTPT and ONATEL began to envisage a sector restructuring, such as for the
separation of the regulatory and operational functions, the autonomy of the operating activities and a
limited liberalization of telecommunications activities. The dialogue with IDA on a new statutory and
regulatory framework was made difficult by the October 1993 political coup. Following lengthy
discussions differences narrowed between the Government's and IDA's positions so that a draft of a
telecommunications law was about to be submitted to Parliament, a decree to establish a
telecommunications regulatory authority was being prepared and limited privatization of ONATEL was
envisaged. The closure of the credit in 1996, put an end to the dialogue.
7.        Financial results. Audits of ONATEL' s accounts have been performed for the years 1989
through 1994, though sometimes with much delay. The reliability of ONATEL's accounting system has
much improved and RNP's accounting system was operational at the end of 1993. The covenant
concerning private subscribers' receivables has been met, but Government's receivables remained at an
unacceptable level, close to one year of billing. Rates of return and self-financing ratios, as defined in the
project agreement, were satisfied up to 1994. Actual results then were substantially above targets. This is
proof that ONATEL's financial situation was quite satisfactory throughout the period of the project and
the local tariff increases might not have been justified.
8.        Physical results. With the exception of rural telephony, financed by IDA, the new facilities
under the project have been operational since 1993: the switching capacity was implemented at the end of
1990, a new transit exchange and a new earth station, completed in 1993, have eased the development of
international communications, so that 15,550 subscribers were connected in the country at the end of
1993. Investment in local networks in the Bujumbura area would enable ONATEL to satisfy the demand
for the next few years. The rural telephony component remained uncompleted at the time of the July 1996
coup, but the limited network that could be installed and made operational covering about 20 percent of
the country considerably increased the traffic flow in the existing facilities of the capital area.. As demand
for telex had switched to fax, ONATEL did not need to extend further the switching capacity as planned.
The parcel sorting center was completed and put into operation.
9.        Compliance with legal covenants was generally satisfactory. The most noticeable failure was
Government's inability to pay its arrears on telecommunications bills.
10.       The economic rate of return was calculated at 20 percent compared to 15 percent in the SAR.
It is considered quite satisfactory, in view of the political circumstances.
11.       Cost of the project. The actual cost of the IDA-funded part of the program was US$ 4.8
million in spite of the cancellation of 11 percent of the credit, because of the appreciation of the SDR with
respect to the US $. The lengthy bidding process and political unrest resulted, however, in driving up
some of the costs and impeding completion of some works or orders. Expenditures for the
telecommunications and postal parts of the project were only about 90 percent and 45 percent,



-0ii -
respectively, of appraisal estimates. The telecommunications component could not be completed in rural
areas and only part of the postal equipment was ordered. The Technical assistance and training part was
completed, including some complementary activities and related expenditures, exceeded appraisal
forecast by about 20 percent.
12.       In spite of the difficult environment, the performance of both the Borrower and the Bank in
implementing the project was generally satisfactory, as the objectives have mainly been attained.
Major factors affecting the project
13.       Political unrest was a major factor for delays in implementation of the project and for its
incompleteness. Delays in procurement were due to administrative constraints, and inadequate local
supervision to personnel turnover, particularly concerning the managing director's and other senior
positions, within the same administrative and political context.
Project sustainability and outcome
14.       Sustainability. Telecommunications is a thriving activity in Burundi and ONATEL manages
profitably its operation, at least as long as demand is very strong and there is no competition, and it has
benefited from the project. ONATEL has proved its usefulness as support to the country's economic and
social growth, but further development should take place in a competitive environment, for which the
country now seems prepared. The telecommunications law will thus help appropriately regulated sector
activities to expand in a liberalized framework. However, if the socio-economic situation does not
improve, sustainability cannot be assured and would remain uncertain.
15.       Assessment of Outcome. The project outcome is satisfactory, though its rural network
component was only partially implemented. The physical objectives were reached in expanding the
facilities in the Bujumbura area, and partly in the province, but unsatisfied demand still remains
throughout the country. Technical assistance, as it was designed at the start of the project, was successful
and a fruitful institutional dialogue was initiated with Government and ONATEL. Other lenders'
contribution was fully satisfactory.
Future operation and lessons learned
16.       Future operation. The future operation of the existing and newly provided facilities from the
project and ONATEL's program are highly dependent upon the socio-economical and political stability
and security conditions in the country. Growth in usage and traffic, where new facilities were provided
from the project, indicated the justification and usefulness of these facilities which is favorable to their
satisfactory future operation. A follow-up IDA operation could: (a) evaluate the unsatisfied demand for
telecommunications services in the country and suggest actions to meet it; (b) ensure that the refo'rm
envisaged in 1996 in discussions with the sector is carried through, with a suitable telecommunications
law, including the end of monopoly for fixed telephones and the opening of competition for all
telecommunications services, a strong regulatory entity and the gradual privatization of ONATEL; and (c)
ensure that ONATEL's reorganization is implemented even before a privatization process is initiated.
Such an operation could be envisaged, if no investment funding is required, as part of the overall
assistance to Public Sector and Enterprise in Burundi.



-iv) -
17.        Lessons learned. The key lessons learned are as follows:
(a)     In a developing country with a high risk of economic and political turmoil, supervision
missions should be unfailingly as frequent as twice a year to guide the implementation
of the project. In spite of turmoil, project implementation should go on, and Bank has
to ensure that there is proper supervision, even if the meetings with the project
counterparts have to take place in a neighboring country.
(b)     Technical assistance has to be focused selectively and delivered in such a way that it
can be absorbed with regards to the skills, size and availability (risk of turnover) of the
staff of the entity, in order to avoid waste and frustration.
(c)     The audit requirement is an excellent covenant, provided the Bank enforce the
recommendations flagged by the auditors to remedy accounts deficiencies, or decide to
suspend the credit, even if difficult circumstances make it necessary to carry the
supervision in a neighboring country but it should be qualified to demand that the
entity remedy the deficiencies flagged by the auditors, through its own staff or external
help.
(d)     The institutional dialogue should take into account the country realities and the
sustainability of any proposed liberalized scheme.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
CREDIT N° 1805-BU
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.   Background and project objectives
1.        The preparation and appraisal of the second telecommunications project were
carried out in Burundi when the first project was still under way (credit 1058-BU was closed
early in 1987). The first telecommunications project, financed by an IDA credit in the amount of
US$ 7.7 million, was appraised just before the establishment of the parastatal Office national des
t6lecommunications (ONATEL) early in 1980, and was designed to help ONATEL structure its
organization, modernize the network and expand it on a national scale. The Government of
Burundi was keen to maintain IDA's support for a second project because of its unique advising
role in structuring the sector and its operating entities, its skill in keeping the balance between
technical and institutional development, and its ability to bring together other lenders to shape a
project. IDA's participation had actually a triggering effect as it attracted, in a concerted
although lengthy effort for setting up a US$ 25.4 million program, the Caisse fran,aise de
developpement (CFD), as it is now named, for US$ 10.5 million, the Government of the
Netherlands associated with a Dutch commercial bank, for US$ 3.9 million each, while
ONATEL financed the equivalent of US$ 2.3 million in local costs.
2.         The part of the program, financed by the IDA credit 1805-BU, signed in October
1987 for the amount of SDR 3.8 million (US$ 4.8 million equivalent), included a postal
component as the Government wished to improve its postal services facilities and build a postal
sorting center, which caused IDA to grant a project preparation facility (PPF) in November 1983
for US$ 220,000. The Ministere des transports, des postes et des tel6communications (MTPT)
implemented the postal component of the project and ONATEL, which was and is still placed
under its supervision, implemented the telecommunications component.
3.         The sector objectives brought forth by the Government of Burundi at the start of the
program were to strengthen further ONATEL's ability: (a) to increase operational efficiency and
quality of service through improved management, maintenance and staff development; (b) ensure
that revenues cover operating costs and contribute significantly to investments; (c) generate tax
revenues for Government; (d) extend services to rural areas; and (e) expand facilities to meet
expressed demand. The identified constraints to be overcome were: (a) management
inefficiency; (b) shortage of skilled staff; (c) inadequate maintenance facilities; and (d) unmet
demand. The Government also wished to establish a postal sector structure and an efficient
postal enterprise. Those objectives and the nature of the institutional support were consistent
with reform initiatives which were then promoted country-wide for other parastatals by IDA.
4.         To meet those sector objectives, ONATEL designed a medium term development
program for priority works for the period 1988 to 1992, which became the physical objectives of
the cofinanced program: (a) the replacement and expansion of switching and distribution
facilities in Bujumbura, for a total capacity of 13,800 main lines; (b) the installation of a new



transit exchange for international telephone and telex traffic and of an international satellite earth
station; (c) a rural-multi access radio link to provide seventy public call offices in rural areas; and
(d) maintenance vehicles and equipment. The project also included a physical component for
postal services, including the construction of a parcel sorting center and the provision of
equipment. At the same time, it was decided that the program would redress ONATEL's main
management inadequacies by: (a) strengthening accounting and financial systems; (b) improving
staff training, particularly for high level staff and non-engineers; and (c) improving the reliability
and capacity of local, long distance and international telephone facilities. In the postal sector, the
Government, supported by IDA, had decided to establish a semi-autonomous entity, Regie
nationale des postes (RNP), with its own administrative organization, including accounting and
planning.
5.         A comprehensive program of technical assistance to ONATEL, provided by CFD,
the Netherlands Government and IDA, including training and some computing equipment, and
amounting to 245 staff months (60 staff months for IDA), was devised to address those
objectives. It was a balance between technical and institutional building with good prospects of
sustained benefits through extensive training of counterpart staff. Technical assistance was
expected to focus on strengthening ONATEL's through: (a) implementation and operation of
new equipment to be installed under the project; (b) accounting, billing and recovery procedures;
(c) management organization by means of the establishment of a management information
system; (d) investment planning and maintenance carried out by an engineering technical advisor
for two years; and (e) training and fellowships. Technical assistance and fellowships were also
provided by IDA for the organization of the postal services, for devising a sector structure and
policy objectives and setting up basic accounting and information procedures (24 staff months).
6.         The project was designed in 1984 in a monopolistic environment. The policy
objectives did not deal with the liberalization of the sector, the introduction of competition, or
active participation of the private sector in development and operations. The project concept was
consistent with the traditional approach to public utilities which prevailed at that time, at least in
the case of small networks. All institutional objectives were concentrated on relieving
organizational, management and financial constraints existing within ONATEL, which appear
now timid but were then realistic. However, near the end of the protracted implementation
period, from the end of 1992, a dialogue started between the Bank and the sector authorities with
a view to broadening substantially the original objectives. If a third project took shape, it could
lead to a reform of the sector towards opening competition in all telecommunications services
and privatization of ONATEL.
B.   Achievement of project objectives.
Institutional development
7.         Institutional Objectives. There were no sector and regulatory reform objectives
specified in the project. However, in 1992, MTPT and ONATEL started to envisage a sector
restructuring, implying the separation of regulatory and operational functions, autonomy of
operating activities and limited liberalization of telecommunications activities. IDA redrafted a
Statement of Sector Policy and TOR for a mission of consultants to be financed by a PPF', but
I A US$ 400,000 PPF was granted in February 1993, for the preparation of a third project, approved by the
Government of Burundi in August 1994 and canceled in June 1996 because of inactivity.



- 3 -
the dialogue was made difficult by the October 1993 political coup and, in the following months,
by the gap between IDA's very liberal position and the Government's more restrained one. Later
in 1996, differences had narrowed: two drafts of a telecommunications law were discussed with
the Bank (the Government planned to submit the last one to Parliament), a decree for a
telecommunications regulatory authority was discussed as well as limited privatization of
ONATEL (with the intention of selling 10 percent of its shares). Closure of the credit put an end
to the dialogue. In the postal sector, RNP was established with a commercial organization.
8.         Organization. Supported by consultants' technical assistance and a comprehensive
program of training devised for the whole spectrum of the staff, ONATEL's structure was
improved with respect to accounting, subscribers' receivables, management and operating
organization, information system, maintenance and planning. However, an action plan, prepared
in 1992 by Consultants for ONATEL's reorganization and the creation of an information system,
pointed out substantial deficiencies which previous technical assistance had not tackled and
would be corrected later: ONATEL's whole accounting and commercial system is still weak, as
data collecting is not exhaustive, controls are non existent and there is no comprehensive
computerization to fasten the information system. The consultant later introduced a data base.
On the other hand, technical assistance set up a satisfactory postal accounting organization.
9.         The objectives of the organization component of the project have been partly
attained, as they were expressed at the time of the project conception - however insufficient they
appear in retrospect, - because strengthening ONATEL' s administrative structure is a long term
undertaking. The results obtained under the project clearly show in which direction the
liberalization of the sector and ONATEL's reorganization should be pursued.
Financial objectives
10.        Annual audit requirements. Audits of ONATEL's accounts have been performed for
the years 1989 through 1994, except for the troubled year 1993, sometimes with much delay.
Failure to produce the audit of the year 1995 was one of the factors for not extending the credit
once more, in 1996. It is clear, from the last auditors' report, concerning the 1994 accounts, that
ONATEL' s accounts still needed substantial improvement and the accounting department
required reinforcement of its staff. Audits for MTPT and RNP have been supplied.
I.        Accounting system. The reliability of the accounting system has much improved, but
it was signaled by the auditors' report for the year 1994 that the main deficiency was the lack of
internal audit and accounting procedures. The accounting system of RNP was operational at the
end of 1993.
12.        Billing and collection. The covenant concerning the presentation of an aging
schedule of receivables was fulfilled and, thanks to the improved billing and collection process,
the covenant concerning private subscribers' receivables has also been met. However, in spite of
late large payments by Government agencies, the covenant concerning maintaining
Government's receivables at an acceptable level was not fulfilled, in particular since 1993 in
contradiction with the Telecommunication Sector policy document. Cumulative current level of
unpaid arrears from official users is close to one year of billing. This may be a common problem
with other public utilities, the resolution of which could be taken up as a part of the country's
efforts through the Service in Charge of Public Enterprises (SCEP) to improve and reform their
management and their relationship with Government through appropriate enterprise contracts.



- 4 -
13.        Tariffs. A tariff study was financed under the credit. Following one of its
recommendations, international tariffs were increased in 1992. Also, the charging structure for
domestic calls was changed in 1993, and the basic pulse rate of local calls was adjusted at a level
that compensated for inflation. This was to be continued in line with the approach to tariff level
and matters in the sectoral policy document. The political events, however, prevented
supervision missions to discuss the tariff structure in due time.
14.        Financial situation. Rates of return of 12 percent and self-financing ratios of 25
percent, as defined in the project agreement, were satisfied up to 1994. Actual results were
substantially above the targets (also higher than the projections of the SAR), with rates of return
of 23 percent and 29 percent in 1993 (the troubled year) and 1994 respectively, and self-
investment ratios of 45 percent and 35 percent respectively. This is proof that ONATEL's
financial situation was quite satisfactory throughout the period of the project and the local tariff
increases may not have been justified, because of the higher productivity of the network. There
was no covenant for the financial situation of the postal services.
15.       Investment program. ONATEL advised IDA in due time of its intention of
modifying its investment program. A study for the investment program 1995-2005 was, in 1993,
recommended to be upgraded, and there was no clear follow-up by the missions after it was
revised by consultants late in 1994.
16.        The financial objectives of the project were attained except for the Government's
receivables: audit reports were produced, rates of return and ratios of self-financing were
reached, but it was clearly no guarantee that the accounting system was in good shape.
Particularly, the production of auditors' reports, which is the cornerstone of IDA's supervisory
policy, is a restricted indicator.
Physical objectives
17.       Implementation schedule. With the exception of rural telephony, financed by IDA,
the new facilities under the project have been operational since 1993: the switching capacity,
estimated to reach 16,800 lines in the project, was implemented at the end of 1990, a new transit
exchange and a new earth station, completed in 1993, have eased the development of
international communications, so that 15,550 subscribers were connected in the country at the
end of 1993. At the end of 1995, 17,200 subscribers were connected which implies that
additional exchange capacity was installed that was not included in the project and would enable
ONATEL to satisfy in part the current pending demand. The rural telephony component started
with a delay of eighteen months, all the equipment was delivered but could not by fully installed
by the time of the July 1996 coup. Because of the political unrest since late 1993, the
implementation had been interrupted and could only partly resume, late in 1995. Only a limited
rural network was operational, covering about 20 percent of the initially designed areas, with
about 40 percent of the delivered equipment installed but not in reliable operational condition at
most distant locations. That limited rural network immediately eased the traffic congestion in the
existing facilities. The 60 percent remaining equipment will be installed when the whole
territory is accessible. IDA decided to cancel the remaining undisbursed SDR 414,000
(equivalent to US$ 523,000) out of a total of SDR 3.8 million (equivalent to US$ 4.8 million).
As demand for telex had switched to fax, ONATEL did not need to extend further the switching
capacity as planned. The parcel sorting center was completed and put into operation.

18.       Growth Objectives of the network. The timing of growth objectives of the network,
as stated in the investment program would have had to be modified to take account of the
political unstableness, though the demand has not abated.
19.       Objectives of service quality. The indicators of quality and maintenance were
defined rather late and political events prevented the supervision missions from ascertaining
whether objectives were met.
20.        The objectives of the project were attained, but the demand remained unsatisfied
because of insecurity conditions, which indicates that the targets could have been more ambitious
at the start of the project, since the demand was strong.
Cost of the project and actual implementation of the IDA-financed components
21.        The cost of the program was estimated to be US$ 25.4 million at appraisal, with
IDA contributing US$ 4.8 million (see Tables 8A and 8B). The actual cost of the project was
US$ 23.8 million. The cost of the IDA part was US$ 4.8 million in spite of the cancellation of
part of the credit, because of the appreciation of the SDR with respect to the US$. The lengthy
bidding process and political unrest resulted, however, in driving up some of the costs and
impeding completion of some works or orders. Expenditures for the telecommunication and
postal parts of the project were only about 90 percent and 45 percent, respectively, of appraisal
estimates. The telecommunications equipment could not be completed in rural areas, though all
rural network items had been delivered. The postal parcel center was completed at the initially
estimated cost but only part of the postal equipment was ordered. The Technical assistance and
Training part was completed, including some complementary activities, and its overall cost
exceeded appraisal forecast by about 20 percent.
Procurement
22.        Procurement authority was limited in ONATEL and subject to public procurement
process and control procedures which delayed the decision making and contract implementation
processes. Also, inefficient administrative constraints at the ministry level hampered the early
start-up of the postal component of the project. These circumstances resulted in delays in
starting and implementing the project.
Disbursements
23.       No particular difficulties were encountered in the disbursement against applications
for withdrawals made by ONATEL in accordance with the Bank's disbursement handbook. IDA
granted three extensions of the closing date, from December 31, 1993 to June 30, 1996, in order
to finance the implementation of the rural telephony component, the implementation of which
was hampered by political unrest, but, on October 29, 1996, did not accept the fourth request,
following the second political coup.

C.   Major factors affecting the project
Factors not generally subject to Government's control
24.        Political unrest was a major factor for delays in implementation of the project and
for its incompleteness.
Factors generally subject to Government's control
25.        Even though ONATEL enjoys a large autonomy in some financial and all
operational matters, the managing director's position and those of other members of the
management team were, since the beginning of the project, subject to frequent new political
nominations and assignments, which were costly in terms of training, acquisition and best use of
scarce management skills and sectoral experience.
26.        As mentioned above, delays in procurement were due to administrative and
organizational constraints.
D.   Project sustainability
Project benefits.
27.        The project benefits include: (a) increasing the quality and coverage of
telecommunications services; (b) improving ONATEL's management and pointing the way
towards making it a commercially-oriented enterprise; and (c) putting the Government on notice
of the need to establish a sector policy and a regulatory framework, and to involve the private
sector in the provision of telecommunications services.
28.        The economic rate of return is calculated at 20 percent (table 9). This is above the
15 percent projected at appraisal, and it is considered quite satisfactory, in view of the
circumstances.
Sustainability
29.        Telecommunications is a thriving activity in Burundi and ONATEL manages
profitably its operation, at least as long as demand is very strong and there is no competition, and
ONATEL has proved its usefulness as support to the country's economic and social growth.
However, the project showed that ONATEL's structure has to be strengthened and the most
expeditious way would be through opening its capital to private shareholders, within a well
regulated sector. The telecommunications law would thus enable the sector to expand within a
competitive environment, but if the socio-economic situation does not improve, sustainability
cannot be assured and would remain uncertain.
30.        The project established a good base in ONATEL to sustain adequate maintenance of
infrastructure (such as tools, vehicles and repair shop). Training of staff was also an important
component, however, staff efficiency was greatly reduced by a high staff turnover and no
improvement in this would be predictable under current circumstances.



- 7 -
31.        The sector needs diversification of services offered to the public and should be open
to an array of mobile phone companies competing with the only T6elcel, in which ONATEL has
a participation.
E.   Bank's performance
Preparation - Appraisal
32.        While the first telecommunications project was being implemented, in July 1982,
the Government of Burundi requested IDA's assistance to reform the postal sector, including the
construction of a parcel sorting center. IDA sent to the field an identification mission in
December 1982 and a preparation mission in July 1983, which recommended to combine
assistance to postal services and continuing support to telecommunications activities in the same
project, and a US$ 220,000 PPF was granted to that effect in November 1983.
33.        The project was appraised in June 1984 and a post-appraisal mission was necessary
in November 1986, due to lengthy discussions among potential lenders for the financing of the
main exchanges, in Bujumbura and Ngarara. The credit was only effective in April 1989,
because of difficulties in fulfilling cross effectiveness conditions and securing technical
assistance contracts.
34.        The project cost has been estimated at US$ 25.4 million for which IDA contributed
for a credit of the equivalent of US$ 4.8 million, the cofinanciers being CFD, the Netherlands
Government and a Dutch commercial bank and ONATEL for the balance of the local costs. The
project would have ended as more institutionally oriented, if the country had been less in turmoil.
Supervision
35.        The first three supervision missions focused on obtaining the fulfillment of the
conditions of effectiveness (four extensions were granted). The next four were regular missions
but the eighth, in October 1993 (the only fifth in four and half years), was suspended by a
political coup and the last two, which were delayed by two years, were devoted to the
disbursement of the rural component of the credit and the institutional dialogue. There was no
ICR mission because the country has been under a trade embargo since 1995, following the July
25, 1995 coup. The cooperation between ONATEL and the Bank's project team was excellent,
in spite of the dire circumstances. Authorities, following some prodding by the Bank, managed
to draft a quite satisfactory law, moreover, the thin rural network was built in a difficult
environment with efficient cooperation between Burundi staff and the contractor. However,
disruption on the continuity of staff on both sides made the process somewhat hectic.
36.        Coordination with other donors was excellent. Some supervision missions were
carried out jointly and in liaison with local representatives.
F.   Borrower's performance
37.    The Government was the borrower and MTPT the executing agency for the postal
component. Part of the credit was onlent to ONATEL, the executing agency for the
telecommunications component. The physical objectives were not fully attained, because of



- 8 -
delays due to procurement constraints at the beginning of the implementation, and later, because
of unforeseen circumstances, for both telecommunications and postal services. The institutional
component, however limited in scope, was implemented.
Compliance with loan covenants
38.        The status of compliance with legal covenants is detailed in Table 10. The reasons
for partial compliance are explained in the above paragraphs. The most noticeable non-
compliance was Government's inability to pay its arrears on telecommunications bills (para. 12).
G.   Assessment of outcome
39.        The project outcome is satisfactory, though its rural network component was only
partially implemented. The physical objectives were reached in expanding the facilities in the
Bujumbura area and partly in the province, but demand still remained unsatisfied throughout the
country. Technical assistance, as it was defined at the start of the project, was successful and the
unplanned institutional dialogue was initiated in the course of the implementation. Other
lenders' contribution was fully satisfactory: their physical objectives were attained at an early
stage and they provided timely technical assistance. A summary of the project's assessments is
given in Table I of Part II.
H.   Future operation.
40.        The future operation and projections of the existing and newly provided facilities
from the project and ONATEL's development program are summarized in Table 6 of Part II.
Increases in usage and traffic, where new facilities were provided from the project, and the
project's sustainability are favorable indications of the productive and satisfactory future
operation of the project. Such an operation, however, is highly dependent upon the socio-
economical and political stability and security conditions in the country.
41.        A follow-up IDA operation to further support sector reform and operational
improvement could: (a) evaluate the unsatisfied demand for telecommunications services in the
country and suggest approaches and actions to meet such demand for all types of services; (b)
ensure that the reform envisaged in 1996 in discussions with the sector is carried through, with a
suitable telecommunications law, including the end of monopc1y for fixed telephones and the
opening of competition for all telecommunications services, a strong regulatory entity and the
gradual privatization of ONATEL; and (c) ensure that ONATEL's reorganization is
implemented, even before a privatization process is initiated. Such an operation is envisaged, if
no investment funding is identified or required, as a part of IDA's overall assistance to the Public
Sector and Enterprises in Burundi.

1.    Key lessons learned
42.         The key lessons learned are as follows:
(a)     In a developing country with a high risk of economic and political turmoil,
supervision missions should be unfailingly as frequent as twice a year to guide the
implementation of the project. In spite of turmoil, project implementation should go
on, and Bank has to ensure that there is proper supervision, even if the meetings
with the project counterparts have to take place in a neighboring country.
(b)     Technical assistance has to be focused selectively and delivered in such a way that
it can be absorbed with regards to the skill, size and availability (risk of turnover) of
the staff of the entity, in order to avoid waste and frustration.
(c)      The audit requirement is an excellent covenant, provided the Bank enforce the
recommendations flagged by the auditors to remedy accounts deficiencies, or decide
to suspend the credit, even if difficult circumstances make it necessary to carry the
supervision in a neighboring country but it should be qualified to demand that the
entity remedy the deficiencies flagged by the auditors, through its own staff or
external help.
(d)      The institutional dialogue should take into account the country realities and the
sustainability of any proposed liberalized scheme.

BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION
ONATEL
Objective and content.
The project was appraised in June 1984, the Credit and Project agreements were
approved by the IDA Directors in May 1987 and signed in October 1987. They were effective in
April 1989. Total IDA credit was in the amount of DTS 3,8 million, of which DTS 3,19 million
were for ONATEL and DTS 0,61 for Post. Three years were required before the implementation
of the telecommunications and post components of the project could start.
The telecommunications component is made of six parts:
1.    Construction of two multiple access VHF transmission lines and 40 public telephones in
rural areas;
2.    Construction of telex switching equipment for 300 additional lines and teleprinters;
3.    Grant of nine scholarships for higher staff;
4.    Setting up training in the telecommunications school;
5.    Supply of training equipment for the telecommunications school; and
6.    Provision of technical assistance.
The project was mostly implemented in compliance with the original objectives.
However, small modifications applied to rural connections and telex switching, as updating the
Telecommunications master plan of brought new orientations.
Extension of telex switching was canceled and the program of rural telephony was
modified to suit changes in technology. The TDMA system was adopted.
Project implementation
Following decision on modifications, ONATEL started implementing the project and
recruited the project coordinator and experts required for updating the Master plan and preparing
the procurement documents.
The planning team was put together and is presently in operation. The Master plan was
updated and is currently being implemented.
The main objective of the training component was to strengthen the 'Training and
proficiency center for telecommunications' (CPFP) through appropriate technical assistance.



- 26 -
In the first phase of its conception, the project was to set up two training units, 'digital
switching' and 'lines and network', to make ONATEL's technicians fully acquainted with the
new digital technique.
During project implementation, two amendments were designed to set up other units: the
first one for 'digital transmission, informatics, energy and air conditioning' and the second for
'management of human resources and repair of modules'.
In April 1992, the recruitment of the Project coordinator and the expert in charge of
organizing the training unit close to the General management launched the project.
The project was expected to:
1.    create a training unit that would be transformed into a Management of human resources
department;
2.    define a training policy and elaborate training plans;
3.    define an organizational structure for the Training center;
4.    define, choose and build laboratory equipment adapted to each specialized technique;
5.    conceive training modules and set up the first courses conducted by the experts, in the
presence of the national counterparts;
6.    Train the national counterparts.
This is how the program was implemented:
a.    The Training unit was constituted but never was in operation, which resulted in a
request for an expert in management of human resources, as part of the
amendment n° 2. The expert has not yet been recruited.
b.    A CFPT organization chart was submitted to General management as part of the
company chart. It was devised in the spirit or the training policy, also submitted
to General management's approval.
c.    Laboratory equipment was ordered and training modules were conceived in the
areas of digital switching and lines and network.
d.    National counterparts were trained except in areas under c/.
The new socio-political situation resulting in the country from the October 1993 events
has had a negative impact on the implementation of rural telephony. Part of the infrastructure
already erected had been vandalized and erection of the rest of the program was stopped.
In view of the delay, the Government of Burundi submitted to IDA a request for
extension of the closing date until June 1996. Work was only resumed in February 1996
following an agreement signed on January 26 1996, in Nairobi, between ONATEL and Alcatel-
Altech representatives, modifying the initial contract.



- 27 -
A list of sites where security conditions could guarantee work resumption and
finalization was selected. Those sites have constituted what is called the 'ONATEL mini
network of rural telephony'.
Work on these sites is now completed, except in Kabezi and Mutumba where it was
interrupted because of problems in erecting a pylon and an antenna in the port of Bujumbura.
There is still much rural telephony equipment which remains to be erected because of
insecurity. As soon as security conditions permit, ONATEL will complete the work on its own
funds.
Performance of IDA and the other lenders.
The performance of IDA and ITU in the conception and implementation of the project is
commendable, as all financing requests and comments on new orientation were quickly
answered.
Concerning the performance of other lenders, there was no problem as the project mainly
dealt with provision of experts and grant of scholarships. Moreover, the rural telephony
component did not interfere with other lenders' financed-components.
