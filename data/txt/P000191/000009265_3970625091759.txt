MEIORANDUW AND RECOHMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNA2IONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
FOR A SECOND TELECOHMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to Burundi
for SDR 3.8 million (US$4.8 million equivalent) is submitted for approval.
The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms and would help finance
rehabilitation and extension of the telecommunications network,
institutional development and some basic assistance to the postal sector.
Cofinancing of $18.3 million equivalent would be provided by the Caisse
Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE), the Netherlands Government and a
Dutch commercial bank. Of the $4.8 million IDA credit, $3.1 million
equivalent would be onlent to ONATEL at the IBRD rate for 17 years
including four years of grace. ONATEL would bear the foreign exchange
risk.
2.        Background.  In 1980, Government established the Office National
des Telecommunications (ONATEL), a publicly-owned parastatal entity, which
provides all telecommunications services in Burundi. At the end of 1985,
ONATEL operated 20 automatic telephone exchanges with 8,130 lines installed
and 5,926 lines connected. This is equivalent to 0.13 telephones per 100
population--one of the lowest telephone densities in the world.  Connected
lines at the end of 1985 met only 63% of expressed demand for service
(subscribers plus applicants) and a much lower proportion of total demand:
unexpressed demand is known to be high because of long waiting times for
connection and poor network coverage. Telex service is automatic and is
available in 15 towns. International telecommunications are provided
through satellite. Local telephone service in Bujumbura is only fair and
repairs are unacceptably slow. The IDA-financed First Telecommunications
Project, wlhose completion is expected in December 1987, will ease traffic
congestion between provincial towns and Bujumbura. It has also provided
initial institutional support for management, budgeting and control
systems. ONATEL is reasonably well organized and its financial
performance, although modest, is improving steadily. The four main
constraints to telecommunications development are remaining management
weakness, shortages of skilled staff, inadequate maintenance and unmet
demand, which the proposed project would address.
3.        Postal services in Burundi are provided by the Postal Department
within the Ministry of Transport, Posts and Telecommunications (KTPT). The
Department operates 38 postal facilities, about one for every 124,000
people. Postal facilities and equipment mostly are dilapidated. Extremely
poor service quality has caused a loss of public confidence and postal
services are close to complete collapse. The potential for financial
services such as postal checking and savings is not fully utilized. The
proposed project would address the following institutional constraints
facing the sector: (a) poor organization of the Department; (b) inadequate
accounting and management information systems; and (c) a shortage of
qualified staff.



4.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project would Increase ONATEL's
operating and financial efficiency, improve the quality and reliability of
services and partially meet unsatisfied demand. The objectives of the
postal component are to initiate the reform of the postal sector and to
support basic sector investments.
5.        Project Description.  The proposed project would have a total
cost of US$25.4 million equivalent; US$24.1 million for telecommunications
and US$1.3 million for postal services. Total foreign exchange costs would
be US$21.8 million (86%). The telecommunications component comprises
US$4.2 million of technical assistance and training and US$19.9 million of
telecommunications equipment. Technical assistance covers: improvement of
accounting, management organization and planning; fellowships and experts
to improve MTPT school programs. Equipment financing covers: replacement
and expansion of telephone and telex facilities in Bujumbura; a new
international transit exchange and expansion of the satellite earth
station; public call offices in rural areas; and vehicles and tools. The
postal component comprises US$0.4 million of technical assistance and
US$0.9 million of postal equipment. Technical assistance covers: a review
of sector structure and reform steps; design of accounting aad information
systems; and management training and fellowships. Equipment financing
covers a parcel sorting center, vehicles and training equipment. The
proposed IDA credit would finance US$3.5 million of the telecommunications
component and the US$1.3 million postal component. A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursement, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank group operations in Burundi are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. Maps are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report
No. 6535-BU dated April 15, 1987, is being circulated separately.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA's strategy is to provide
support to the Government to cor-tinue implementation of its structural
adjustment programs under SAC I (Credit 1705-BU) while addressing long term
structural constraints in key sectors. In line with our support for
institutional development and improving managerial and technical skills,
the proposed project would build upon the achievements of the first project
and strengthen ONATEL's ability to operate and maintain facilities, to
implement priority investments and to plan future development of the
sector.  These objectives, and the nature of the institutional support
included in the proposed project are consistent with reform initiatives to
be carried out for other parastatals under the SAC I. By providing pilot
assistance to the postal sector, IDA will have the opportunity to establish
a dialogue with Government on a strategy for comprehensive postal reform
and to assist Government in planning and implementing reform steps.
7.        Actions Agreed.  The following actions were agreed at
negotiations: (1) Government and its agencies will settle accounts with
ONATEL promptly upon receipt of billing; (2) ONATEL will agree with IDA on
a plan to reduce arrears owed by residential subcribers, and, each year,
present to IDA an accounts receivable aging schedule with provisions made
for irrecoverable debts; (3) Based upon reco  endations of the postal
study, the Government will agree with IDA on a plan and timetable for t-he



-3-
reform and restructuring of the postal sector before March 31, 1988; (4)
ONATEL and Government will review implementation of all technical
assistance and training with IDA each year and agree upon objectives for
the following year; (5) Government and ONATEL will consult with IDA before
making changes to ONATEL's investment program which would increase
investment costs by more than 5% in any year; (6) each year ONATEL will
agree with IDA on financial, operational and maintenance performance
targets for the following year; (7) Government will enable ONATEL to
adjust the structure and level of tariffs as required for ONATEL to earn a
12% rate of return on net revalued assets; and (8) ONATEL will maintain net
cash generation equal to the local funds required for its investment
program, or 25% of total investment funds required, whichever is greater.
8.        The following would be special conditions of effectiveness:
(1) Government will have appointed a project coordinator acceptable to IDA
for the postal component; (2) The Government and ONATEL will have appointed
consultants to provide the postal and telecommunications technical
assistance in accordance with already agreed terms of reference; (3) ONATEL
and Government will have signed a subsidiary loan agreement; and (4)
conditions precedent to effectiveness of the loan from the CCCE will have
been fulfilled.
9.        Justification.  Benefits from the proposed project would reach
most sectors of Burundi's economy. Improved telecommunications would
increase management efficiency, improve coordination of economic activities
and so increase business productivity. Benefits to rural communities
mainly would be through improved marketing made possible by the
availability of better telephone service. More reiiable and prompt mail
delivery would also improve business efficiency, facilitate Government
administration, help promote rural trade and strengthen resource
mobilization by improving postal checking and saving services. The
estimated economic rate of return of the project is 28%.
10.       Risks.  Tne project has been adequately planned and does not
present any significant technical risk. Preparation of bidding documents
for procurement of equipment and services is well advanced. Residual risks
are that financial and institutional benefits would be delayed or reduced
througlh slow implementation. These risks are addressed through agreed
mechanisms to monitor implementation and make adjustments as necessary.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
