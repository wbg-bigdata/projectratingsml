AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION PROJECT
PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                   Republic of Zambia.
Executing Agency:           Bank of Zambia (BOZ)
Amount:                      SDR 24.7 million (US$25.0 million equivalent).
Terms:                      Standard IDA terms.
Project Description:        The proposed Project would encourage the
Government to continue the on-going and to
carry out further policy and institutional
reforms on issues that have hitherto cons-
trained agricultural development in Zambia; it
would also help to finance critical production
inputs with a view to arresting the declining
trend in agricultural production. The main
reforms would be: adopting a pricing policy
consistent with regional comparative advantages
and the principle of full cost recovery; and
improving efficiency of produce marketing and
input distribution system by making the system
more competitive through allowing private
sector participation. The Project would
finance imports of farm machinery, spare parts,
agro-chemicals, seeds and other miscellaneous
inputs which are in short supply and constrain
production.
Main Benefits:              The envisaged policy and institutional reforms
would have widespread benefits, though
difficult to quantify. In particular, they
would reinforce Government efforts to diversify
the economy from the extreme dependency on
mining, especially through: (a) adopting a
pricing policy consistent with regional
comparative advantages, thereby promoting a
more efficient use of resources and thus
enhancing the general capacity of the
agricultural sector to generate alternative
sources of incomes and employment; (b) adopting
a price structure that allows full-cost
recovery, thereby helping to eliminate
marketing subsidies and thus releasing fiscal
resources to support diversification efforts;



(ii )
and (c) adjusting wheat product prices and
encouraging implementation of measures to
reduce uneconomic fertilizer consumption, thus
reducing imports and releasing foreign exchange
resources for diversification investments. In
addition, the physical inputs would enable
farmers to respond to the improved policy
environment and increase agricultural
production in general and maize output in
particular. It is estimated that, during the
Project's economic life of 12 years, the
incremental maize production would average
190,000 tons annually with a gross value of
about K 59.8 million, and a net present value
of about K 34.3 million (US$17.2 million). The
economic rate of return has been roughly
estimated at 59%.
Main Direct Beneficiaries:  The proposed policy and institutional reforms
would benefit a wide spectrum of farmers,
including subsistence farmers on the verge of
entering the market economy.  The major part of
of the tractor units and agro-chemicals would
benefit the medium- and large-scale farmers;
however, it is estimated that about 20% of
these inputs would go to the market-oriented
smallholders (emergent farmers).   In addition,
about 7,000 smallholders would benefit from
ox-drawn implements financed by the Project.
Main Risks:                  The Project's main risks are: delays or failure
to carry out the envisaged policy and institu-
tional reforms; inadequate availability of
complementary inputs, especially fertilizers,
which are not financed by the Project but
without which the Project's inputs would
achieve very little; and recurrence of
droughts. The Government has recently
demonstrated the political will to implement
unpopular measures and this now makes it
realistic to expect that, in view of the grim
financial and economic prospects confronting
Zambia, the Government would take resolute
steps to implement the reforms envisaged under
the proposed Project. The likelihood of
serious shortages of fertilizers is expected to
be significantly reduced by the on-going and
planned efforts to increase local production of



(iii)
fertilizers, and bilateral assistance which has
been readily forthcoming in the past; at nego-
tiations, the Government confirmed availability
of such assistance. Little can be done about
droughts in the short-run; however, for the
long-run, research is proceeding to develop
more drought resistant crop varieties and
farming techniques.

ZAMBIA
AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
A. Salient Economic Features
1.01      Zambia is a land-locked country with a surface area of 763,000
sq. km, a population of about 6.3 million of which 43% is urban, and a
per capita GDP of US$526. The service sector, accounting for about 48% of
GDP in 1980-83 and consisting mainly of governmental services, is the
single largest sector; however, the mining sector, accounting for about 15%
of GDP and 95% of total export revenues is the most important productive
sector, because of its overwhelming impact on the rest of the economy
through its effects on the available development resources in general and
foreign exchange earnings in particular. Manufacturing and agriculture are
the other major productive sectors, respectively accounting for 22% And 14%
of GDP and jointly contributing about 5X to export earnings. Copper is by
far the most important export mineral, representing about 90% of mining
export values, while cobalt ranks next and represents about 6X of export
earnings,with the remainder coming from zinc and lead.
1.02      The manufacturing sector is dominated by agri-related activities
(food, beverages, tobacco, textiles, wood and wood products) which account
for about 65% of value added in manufacturing; the rest of the sector
comprises mostly rubber, chemicals, petroleum, and plastic products which
contribute about 17%; and metal products which contribute about 11%. The
sector is characterized by generally high production costs relative to the
border price equivalents, excess capacity, and high capital and import
intensities. It is estimated that most of the manufacturing enterprises in
the country are operating at less than 50% of the installed capacity
primarily due to the shortage of foreign exchange. While it accounted for
about 22% of GDP, the sector absorbed about 42% of the country's total
imports during 1979-81. The heavy dependence on imports renders the sector
fragile especially with regard to capacity utilization. Although Zambia has
a wide range of natural resources, numerous obstacles limit their use as a
source of industrial raw materials. The known iron ore dep(usits are of a
poor quality for economic exploitation on a large scale. Forestry
resources are abundantly available but the bulk of the indigenous wood is
unusable for industrial purposes. On the other hand, several agricultural
raw materials, which are now imported (oil seeds, natural fibres, livestock
by-products, etc.) can be technically produced locally, but their
production has been constrained by the various factors which have generally
hampered the growth of the agricultural sector (paras 2.05 to 2.28).
1.03      The development of Zambia's agriculture has remained far below
the potential. Of the estimated 60 million ha of arable land, only about
12 million or 20% is currently cultivated. Although much of the land is
infertile and is suited mainly to extensive farming, there still remains
large areas of idle land consisting of pockets of medium to high potential
soils. The rains tend to be erratic, but the climate is generally
favorable for the cultivation of a wide range of crops. Maize is by far
the most important crop and accounts for over 70% of the value cf the
marketed agricultural products. The other significant crops are cassava,



-2-
millet, sorghum, groundnuts, sunflower, cotton, tobacco, sugar cane, rice,
soyabeans, and a variety of legumes and vegetables. The country also has a
sizeable number of the various types of livestock, and cattle are a major
source of cash income and offer a considerable potential for animal draft
power.
1.04      The sector is acutely dualistic.  On the one extreme is the
traditional farming system entailing about 460,000 or about 76% of the
estimated 600,000 farm households, who cultivate an average of slightly
less than 2 ha, using family labor and simple hand tools, and producing for
subsistence purposes with only occasionally marketable surpluses. On the
other extreme is a small category of medium- and large-scale commercial
farmers,comprising about 4% of the farm households and producing about 40X
of the value of maize and 55% of the other marketed agricultural products,
using a full range of inputs, and characterized by high yields. The
extreme dualism has been slightly moderated by the development of
smallholder (emergent) market-oriented farmers, numbering about 125,000 or
20% of the farm households, cultivating an average of 3 ha, using mainly
hand tools and labor but also oxen and hired tractors, and modest amounts
of purchased seasonal inputs especially fertilizers; these farmers produce
deliberately for the market, and generally obtain much higher yields than
the traditional farmers. Together with the occasional surpluses from
traditional farmers, the smallholder market-oriented farmers account for
60% of the value of maize and 45% of the other marketed agricultural
products.
B. National Economic and Social Goals, and Performance
1.05      Since Independence 20 years ago, Zambia's economic and social
goals have been aimed at attaining a level of income sufficient to meet at
least the basic needs of the population, with special reference to rural
areas, and at achieving an enduring socio-political stability as an
indispensable foundation for economic development. The country has sought
to achieve these goals through various policies directed at accelerating
overall economic growth, narrowing the urban-rural income gap, diversifying
the economy from the extreme dependence on copper, and disengaging it from
the historical dependence on southern Africa, Zamblanizing the ownership of
the major economic enterprises, expanding access to education, health and
other essential public services, and developing basic infrastructure.
1.06      Some notable achievements have been made especially in education,
in re-routing transport outlets from the south to the north through Dar es
Salaam, in developing basic infrastructure, in Zambianizing the economy
mostly through parastatal ownerships, and in maintaining socio-political
stability. However, the achievements have on balance fallen far short of
expectations as is manifested by the fact that the economy has been on a
sharply declining trend for the past nine years. In real terms during
1975-83 compared to 1970-74, total income fell by about 22%, per capita
income by about 36%, capacity to import by about 61%, net fixed capital
formation by about 67%, gross domestic savings by about 72%, and fiscal
revenues by about 33%; in addition, overall food self-sufficiency declined
by about 21%, while the balance of payments on current account deteriorated
from a surplus position to a deficit of K 369 million, or 14% of GDP (Table
1.1). Furthermore, the urban-rural income gap has remained wide, with

average rural income at about one-third of the urban level. Efforts to
diversify the economy have met with little success and the economy
continues to be heavily dependent on mining and, therefore, highly
sensitive and vulnerable to external factors; the modest structural changes
that have taken place in this respect during the last decade have been more
a result of an absolute decline in mining production than of a positive
differential growth among the major productive sectors.
1.07      While Zambia has made considerable progress with regard to
education, it continues to face an acute shortage of skilled manpower and,
to a considerable extent, is still dependent on expatriates, particularly
in the professional and technical areas. The country is also handicapped
by demographic features which include a high rate of population growth at
about 3.1% per annum, a high economic dependency ratio of 1.4, and a high
urbanization growth rate of about 6.7% annually. These factors necessitate
diversion of a large part of the available resources from immediately



-4-
productive activities to education, health and other social services, and
thus constitute a severe strain on an economy beset by economic and
financial crisis of such a magnitude as is now facing Zambia.
C. Current Economic and Financial Crisis (1980-83)
1.08.     Precipitated by a 40% drop in copper prices during 1975, an
economic and financial crisis of major proportions has continued to plague
Zambia and to worsen steadily to the present day. In 1983 compared to the
1980-82, average real per capita income is estimated to have fallen further
by about 6.6%, capacity to import by about 191, net fixed capital formation
by about 52Z, while the balance of payments deficit on current account
deteriorated by about 13.1Z; in addition , after slowing down towards the
end of the 1970s, inflation has assumed a sharp upward trend, rising from
about 12.4% during 1980-82 to about 25% during 1983, to a large extent
reflecting recent devaluation and price decontrol (Table 1.2). Several
factors have contributed to this situation but the most important are: a
chronic decline in Zambia's external terms of trade; a secular decline in
copper production and, consequently, export volume; recurrent droughts; an
increasingly heavy external debt service burden; and an adverse policy and
institutional environment.

1.09      Mainly as a result of depressed economic conditions in the
industrialized countries, the world copper prices and demand have remained
weak over the past nine years. Although some recovery has taken place and
copper prices rose by about 18% during 1980-82 compared to 1970-74, the
prices have continued to be well below the pre-1974 levels in real terms,



-5-
averaging about 50X of the 1970-74 level during 1980-83. In addition, the
prices of cobalt, the next important mineral export, dramatically plummeted
from USS25 per lb in 1981 to US$6 per lb in 1982 and further to about
US$5.70 per lb toward the end of 1983. The situation has been aggravated
by a continuous fall in copper production and export volume, reflecting a
secular declining trend arising from the facts that copper deposits are
becoming increasingly less accessible and ore grades less rich. Partly as a
result, copper production declined from 750,000 tons in 1976 to an average
of 620,000 tons in 1980-82, and down to 580,000 tons in 1983; it is
therefore estimated that, at the prevailing rate of exploitation, the
economically exploitable copper reserves are likely to be exhausted in
about 15-20 years.   In addition, Zambia has been plagued by severe
droughts during most of the past four years, necessitating large imports of
maize, estimated to have cost the country about K 11 million in 1982/83.
1.10      A further factor underlying the current crisis facing the country
is related to external debts. Zambia's debt service amounted to about 27%
of export earnings in 1980-81 and is estimated to have risen to about 34%
in 1983. Despite large accumulation of payment arrears, debt servicing
outlays siphoned off over 45% of total disbursements of medium and
long-term capital inflow during 1980-83. The external debt burden,
declining copper prices and export volume have exerted a severe strain
particularly on the balance of payments. The balance of payments has been
characterized by a chronic disequilibrium since 1975, and despite major
cutbacks on imports in real terms (para 1.16), the deficit on current
account rose from an average of K 212 million, or 10.3% of GDP, during
1975-79 to K 561 million, or 15.9% of GDP, during 1980-83. The persistent
deterioration in the balance of payments position has led to a severe
shortage of foreign exchange which, in turn, has resulted in acute
shortages of imported machinery, components, spare parts and industrial raw
materials, thereby causing considerable under-utilization of production
capacity throughout the country, and a deterioration of basic infra-
structure.
1.11      The on-going crisis has also caused serious difficulties with
regard to public revenues. The persistently low copper prices, coupled
with steadily rising mining costs, have eroded the profitability of the
mining industry as a result of which the sector has virtually disappeared
as a major source of fiscal revenues.   Whereas the mining industry
provided an average of K 172 million or 41% of total Government revenue
during 1970-74, it provided only an average of K 19 million or 3% of total
Government revenue during 1975-82. Although measures to generate more
revenues from non-mining sources have succeeded in raising fiscal revenues
by about 60% during 1980-82 compared to 1975-79, recurrent expenditures
have been rising more sharply to the effect that budgetary deficits rose by
about 74% from K 301 million during 1975-79 to K 524 million, or 14.7% of
GDP, during 1980-83. These deficits have been financed mostly by borrowing
from the banking system, with the Government accounting for about 69% of
the total domestic credit during 1980-83, thereby crowding out the
availability of resources to the private sector in addition to exerting an
inflationary pressure on the economy.



-6-
1.12      The economy's capacity to withstand external shocks has been
impaired by unfavorable domestic policies and practices, notably inappro-
priate commodity and factor pricing policies, poor allocation of public
resources, an over-valued currency, a deficient tariff structure, and an
over-extended and generally inefficient parastatal sector. Until recently,
all commodity prices were controlled by the Government and were generally
skewed in favor of and entailed heavy budgetary subsidies to the urban
consuers '.vhile providing inadequate incentives to agricultural and
industrial producers. Interest rates are also controlled by the Government
and have been set at levels far below inflation rates, whereas wages have
been rising sharply. This situation has tended not only to discourage
savings but also, coupled with duty-free import of and accelerated
depreciation allowance for capital goods and an over-valued currency, to
encourage a capital-intensive mode of production throughout the economy.
Moreover, the over-valued currency has been acting against exports while
making imports artificially cheaper and, together with low tariffs on raw
materials, has thus encouraged importation of raw materials at the expense
of local production.
1.13      Inappropriate allocation of public resources has been a further
major factor accounting for the poor performance of the Zambian economy,
considering that the Government commands a substantial proportion of the
available resources.   The bulk of the public expenditures has continued to
go mainly to social services, with the share of the directly productive
sectors falling from 12% of the total expenditures during 1970-74 to about
62 during 1980-83. In addition, the brunt of the measures to restrain
public expenditures has been borne mostly by capital outlays and non-wage
operating costs. As a proportion of total public expenditures between
1970-74 and 1980-83, wage costs rose from 19% to 23% and consumer subsidies
from 6Z(K 34 million) to 10% (K 138 million); on the other hand, capital
outlays fell from 33% to 15% and non-wage operating costs from 14% to 12Z.
The decline in the ratio of non-wage operating costs to wages has meant
increasing under-utilization of the public manpower resources.
1.14      The parastatals, originally expected to generate incremental
development resources, have been a heavy drain on the economy. Since
independence in 1964, Zambia has assigned the parastatals an increasing
role in the production and distribution of goods and services in all
sectors of the economy. Many of them have been operating at substantial
losses which have had to be covered by credit from the banking system and
budgetary subsidies. The poor performance has been due to several factors,
notably: adverse pricing policy; weak managerial, administrativP and
supervisory capabilities; ill-defined objectives; limited authority
relative to responsibility; lax accountability; and inadequate attention to
economic considerations.
1.15      The Government has increasingly come to recognize the need to
carry out policy and institutional changes with a view to reversing the
downward trend which has characterized tle Zambian economy during the past
nine years, and to diversify the economy from the dependence on the mining
industry. To this end, the Government has initiated or committed itself to
initiating policy and institutional reforms which include:



-7-
(a)  improving price and non-price producer incentives;
(b) mobilizing resources partly by reducing subsidies, and improving
their allocation through systematic planning to shift resources
to productive investments;
(c)  adjusting wage and interest rate policies to reverse the past
trend which has tended to encourage consumption at the expense of
investments;
(d)  adopting a flexible exchange rate system; and
(e)  improving the efficiency of parastatal enterprises by
strengthening their technical and management capacity, and
creating an environment as would enable them to become
financially self-sufficient.
1.16      Several of the above measures have already been implemented
(Annex 1). In December 1982, all consumer prices were decontrolled except
for candles, maize and wheat products; agricultural producer prices have
been raised to levels close to or above the border price equivalents; and
a number of non-price incentives, notably foreign exchange retention
allowances and concessional tax rates, nave been introduced with a view to
stimulating production and encouraging new non-mineral exports.
Furthermore, the Government has undertaken institutional changes aimed at
improving operational and financial performance of the parastatal
enterprises, attaining a better match between budgetary recurrent and
capital costs, improving foreign exchange allocation procedures, and
strengthening agricultural planning capability. The Government has also
devalued the Kwacha by about 42%, adopted a system of flexible exchange
rates, increased interest rates across the boards reduced budgetary
deficits from K 765 million in 1982 to an estimated K 308 million in 1983,
and subsidies from K 154 million in 1982 to an estimated K 83 million in
1983. In addition, measures have been adopted to restrain increases in
Government employment and in wages throughout the economy. In real terms,
total imports have been reduced from K 332 million in 1975-79 to K 241
million in 1980-82 and to K 157 million in 1983.
D. Short-term Outlook and Medium-term Prospects
1.17      In the short to medium term, the performance of the Zambian
economy critically depends on the behavior of the world copper prices and
demand; it will also depend significantly on the success and impact of the
on-going policy and institutional reforms, and on Government's ability to
encourage increased domestic savings while directing a greater amount of
investment resources into the main productive sectors in general, and into
the quick-pay-off activities in particular. The economy will cintinue to
be heavily dependent on foreign exchange resources not only to finance
importation of essential capital and intermediate goods but also to meet
the mounting external debt payment obligations. In view of the secular
decline in copper production and export volume, coupled with a limited
scope for a rapid growth of non-mineral exports, the requisite foreign
exchange resources during the remainder of the 1980s will need to come
mostly from improvement in copper prices.



-8-
1.18      Current copper prices are below average world production costs
and the Bank commodity price projections therefore envisage copper prices
to rise by about 12% in real terms between 1985 and 1990. In addition, the
policy and institutional reforus already in place should have a positive
impact on the economy. The devaluation of the Kwacha should make the
mining industry more profitable and, in combination with the foreign
exchange retention allowances and concessional tax rates, may stimulate
non-traditional exports. Similarly, the decontrol of consumer prices and
the high increases in producer prices should encourage increased industrial
and agricultural production, while the reduction in subsidies releases
public funds to productive investments. Nonetheless, as recent Bank
projections indicate, Zambia will continue to face severe economic diffi-
culties in general, and balance of payments problems in particular during
the remainder of the current decade, with GDP growing by about 2.32, per
capita GDP and consumption falling by 0.3% and 1.7% respectively, while the
balance of payments will experience a substantial financing gap (Table
1.3). Given the fact that imports have already been cut severely in real
terms, the grim prospects necessitate a large inflow of external assistance
to permit even a modest rate of growth and prevent a possible collapse of
the Zambian economy.

Source: Summary from  Zambia; Country Economic Memorandum;
Issues and Options for Economic Diversification";
April 16, 1984.
1.19      The situation described above underlines the urgency of
accelerating the development of the non-mining sectors to provide
alternative sources of income, export earnings, savings, and employment.
Achieving this objective is made more difficult now than ever before by the
fact that the mining sector itself will continue to be a substantial
consumer of the available domestic and 'oreign resources at a time when



such resources are critically needed to support diversification into other
sectors, and by the fact that the external debt servicing will absorb a
large proportion of the foreign exchange earnings. The agricultural sector
offers the most promising prospects of achieving the diversification goal
in the short to medium term, particular through ensuring adequate food
supply so as to obviate the need for higher imports, and through increasing
the supply of locally produced industrial raw materials in order to
facilitate greater utilization of the existing manufacturing capacity and
consequently reducing the high import-intensity which has hitherto
characterized the majority of the maw;facturing enterprises in Zambia.
II. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. National Agricultural Goals and Achievements
2.01      Agricultural development efforts in Zambia have historically
aimed at several goals, some of which are mutually incompatible. In
addition to diversifying the economy away from mining, the main goals of
the agricultural sector have been directed at attaining self-sufficiency in
staple food crops, especially maize; spreading growth and development to
all parts of the country thereby helping to narrow the rural-urban income
gap and to redress regional disparities; and at ensuring low-cost food for
the mining and industrial workers by keeping agricultural prices low.
Despite various development programs and projects since Independence two
decades ago, little progress has been made towards achieving these goals.
The country continues to import agricultural commodities which could be
produced locally,notably vegetable oils (Annex 2, Table 1).   Moreover,
after attaining self-sufficiency in maize in 1971 and becoming a net
exporter fior the subsequent six years, Zambia has reverted to being a
Table 2.1 - Average Annual Growth Rates
(Percentage)
1970-74     1975-82
Marketed Volume of Main Crops
Maize                                 26.1         -2.7

Groundnuts (Shelled)                 -13.1        -11.6
2.03      The sector's contribution to diversification efforts has been
minimal. Furthermore, its impact on the urban-rural income gap, and the
regional disparities has been equally disappointing. Though they have
been improving during the 1980s following sharp increases in agricultural
producer prices, the rural-urban barter terms of trade were about 28X
against rural areas in 1980-81 compared to 1970, partly reflecting a



- 10 -
continuous rise in wages in all the non-agricultural sectors while farm
prices were kept low through Government control. As a result, the urban-
rural income gap remained wide and rural incomes are estimated at about
one-third of the urban level. Little has been achieved towards redressing
regional disparities as the three ecologically better endowed and histori-
cally more developed provinces have continued to account for over 90% of
the marketed maize and other farm products, more or less as they did prior
to Independence.
2.04      Although throughout the last decade Zambia continued to carry out
a wide range of programs and projects to stimulate agricultural development
and growth, it is evident that the past efforts have failed to generate
rates of growth sufficient to ensure satisfactory rural incomes, and
adequate food and agro-raw materials for the rapidly growing population.
The reasons behind the poor results are many and include external factors,
notably the shortage of foreign exchange and severe droughts which have hit
the country in three successive years during the recent past. However, the
adverse impact of such external shocks and natural calamities has been
greatly exacerbated by a number of internal constraints which have weakened
the Zambian economy in general and the agricultural sector in particular.
B. The Major Constraints
Pricing Policies
2.05      Inappropriate pricing policies have been one of the major factors
constraining the growth of Zambia's agriculture. Producer prices of the
major crops, notably maize, have been subject to Government control mainly
in the interest of maintaining a cheap food regime for the benefit of the
industrial workers and urban population. Accordingly, producer prices
were, until three years ago, kept substantially below the border-price
equivalents, while retail prices were set below production and marketing
costs, resulting in mounting subsidies mainly to consumers. For crops such
as maize, tobacco, cotton and wheat, which the farmers cannot market out-
side the parastatal channels, the official low producer prices are at once
the effective prices, and have had the effect of imposing an implicit tax
on producers and creating a disincentive to increased production. The
policy was drastically modified towards the end of 1982, when all consumer
prices were decontrolled except, as far as agriculture is concerned, for
maize and wheat products; following negotiations for this Project, the
Gvernment decontrolled wheat product prices effective from Nov'ember 1,
1984.   Although the Government continues to set all producer prices, and
to control maize producer as well as fertilizer selling prices, they hav-.
been increased substantially in real terms, and, until the later half of
1984, to levels close to or above the border-price equivalents.1/ The
Government has thus taken notable steps towards improving the pricing
policy. However, the policy continues to entail a number of features that
adversely affect agricultural development, namely: a price structure for
maize and fertilizers that does not permit full cost recovery and which
involves uniform producer throughout the country, while allowing inadequate
regional differentials for consumer prices of maize; and a defective price
setting methodology for the controlled prices.
1/ The gap between the domestic and import-parity prices of maize has
widened since mid-1984 mainly as a result of devaluation of the Kwacha.



- 11 -
2.06      The resale prices charged by the marketing agencies, Namboard and
Cooperatives, for maize and fertilizer were recently raised to a level
which covers the procurement costs (producer prices for maize, and
fertilizer landed cost) incurred by these agencies, but they still do not
allow any margins for transport, handling, storage, and other relevant
marketing overheads. These marketing agencies are therefore compelled to
remain dependent on budgetary subsidies to cover these costs, and this has
several adverse effects because: (i) it fosters inefficiencies since there
is no compelling reason to control costs as the Government stands ready to
cover lossses; (ii) it hinders the development of essential marketing
facilities, such as storage, because the responsible agencies are unable to
generate the required financial resources; (iii) it results in mounting
financial charges to the marketing agencies as delays in receiving
subsidies are becoming longer and longer, thus forcing these agencies to
increasingly resort to costly overdraft facilities from the banking system;
and (iv) it inhibits the growth of private enterprise which can survive
only if allowed to recoup full costs, including a reasonable return on
capital and management. It is therefore important that Namboard and the
Cooperatives are enabled to be financially wholly self-dependent, not only
to reduce the burden on fiscal resources, but also to minimize these other
adverse effects and particularly to foster financial discipline and a
stronger awareness of the cost-and-return imperatives, both of which are
critically needed if these agencies are to become financially viable and,
thus, valuable assets to the economy. Under the proposed Project, the
Government would take appropriate measures to this end (para 3.07 (a) ).
2.07      The rationale for controlling maize and wheat product prices is
that these commodities are regarded as an essential part of the Zambian
diet. As a result of a dialogue initiated under this Project, the Govern-
ment has agreed to decontrol wheat product prices mainly because, unlike
maize which constitutes the predominant proportion of food consumption for
the majority of the Zambians both in the rural and urban areas, the
consumption of wheat products is overwhelmingly confined to the urban
dwellers (Table 2.2). Furthermore, wheat product prices have remained
unchanged during the
Table 2.2 -     Estimated Annual Per Capita Consumption
(Percentage of Total Cereal and Cassava Intake)
Maize       Wheat
Rural Areas                     65.5         2.8
Urban Areas                     71.7        25.6
Zambia                          68.0        11.9
past three years as a result of which these products have become increas-
ingly cheaper relative to such commodities as maize meal and cassava,
thereby tending to encourage greater consumption of wheat, which is mostly
imported, at the expense of locally produced commodities. There is,
therefore, little economic justification in continuing the control over



- 12 -
wheat product prices, especially since a price increase is unlikely to have
a major impact on the cost of living since wheat products are estimated to
account for less than 2% of the urban population expenditures on food.
2.08      Since 1974/75, the Government has set producer and, until
mid-1984 (para 3.07), consumer prices of agricultural products at a uniform
level throughout the country, partly with a view to lessening the transport
constraint by wholly subsidizing transport costs. Partly as a result of
the vast size of the country combined with a widely scattered population,
internal transport costs are considerably high; for example, in the case of
maize, transport costs during 1980 averaged about 52.7% of the producer
price and 41.5% of the retail price. This restricts supply responses among
the farmers off the line-of-rail, who make up the majority of the Zambian
farmers, as the high transport costs have an effect equivalent to reducing
producer prices and thus represent a major disincentive to such farmers.
The high transport costs dictated that, from an economic efficiency point
of view, most of the marketable food surpluses have to be produced close to
the urban centres where the non-agricdltural workers are concentrated.
Consequently, the preponderant majority of the Zambian farmers, located as
they are in remote areas and producing relatively bulky crops, have very
limited opportunities to benefit from the available markets in the major
urban centres along the line-of rail.
2.09      The major part of the subsidies associated with this policy has
been reflected chiefly in lower consumer prices. The resultant low
consumer prices have tended to encourage the consumption of maize at the
expense of the traditional crops, such as cassava and sorghum, most of
which are marketed outside Namboard and cooperative channels and therefore
receive no subsidies; the policy has therefore acted against the interest
of the estimated 60% of traditional farmers for whom, due to unfavorable
climate and soil conditions, the cultivation of maize is generally marginal
compared to such traditional crops. Rather than spreading development to
these farmers, the uniform price system has constrained increased produc-
tion of the crops in which they enjoy comparative advantages. Furthermore,
in addition to giving distorted price signals to producers and consumers,
thereby leading to inefficient allocation of resources, the policy has
contrained overall agricultural development because it ignores the inter-
and intra-regional comparative advantages in a country characterized by
such widely varying climatic and soil conditions as Zambia is.
2.10      The policy also has other built-in features which militate
against the equity objectives it was originally intended to achieve. The
size of the benefit to an individual farmer depends not only on how far he
is located from the market but also on the bulkiness of his crop relative
to value, and the amount he produces for the market. This means, for
example, that rice and wheat farmers benefit proportionally less than maize
farmers, and large-scale farmers benefit more than smallholders. With
regard to fertilizers, the subsidy benefits particularly the few who
already have sufficient production resources to cultivate large acreage and
who find the available technological packages suited to their farming
system. The available technological packages are largely unsuitable for
the preponderant majority of the farmers; until this constraint is subs-
tantially resolved, the majority of the farmers stand to gain little from



- 13 -
from fertilizer subsidies and would probably have been better off if the
subsidies had been used to provide them with better research and extension
support. Apart from the fact that there is no practical way to removing the
subsidies without introducing a regionally differentiated price structure,
the uniform price policy needs to be changed so as to take full recognition
of inter-regional comparative advantages. Under the proposed Project, the
Government would begin to take appropriate measures accordingly (para 3.07
(a) ).
2.11      The methodology currently used to determine produce prices
remains unsatisfactory. The prices are derived from estimated average
production costs for the year immediately preceding the cropping season,
based on a single model farm budget for the whole country, and including a
return to fixed capital which varies widely from crop to crop and year to
year for no apparently justifiable financial or economic reasons. Apart
from the fact that the data used have little empirical basis, the resultant
prices have no bearing on the prevailing or anticipated supply-demand
imbalances, or on the likely changes in incremental production costs as the
desired increase in production necessitates expanding cultivation into
relatively marginal areas, and does not take into account the trading
opportunities open to the country as reflected by border prices. A better
price setting methodology needs to be evolved, especially for maize but
also for fertilizers, to reflect border price equivalents (para 3.07 (f) ).
Non-price Producer Incentives
2.12      The Government has introduced a number of non-price producer
incentives, notably concessional tax rates for agricultural incomes;
accelerated depreciation and customs duty exemptions for farm machinery;
and foreign exchange retention allowances to those marketing over, for
example, 5,000 bags of maize, and 50% of foreign exchange value to those
exporting non-traditional commodities. Tax rates on farming incomes were
reduced from 80% to 25% in 1981 and to 15% in 1982, and farmers are now
allowed to write off 100% of capital cost of farm machinery and implements
within two years. Although these incentives mostly benefit the medium and
large scale farmers, the Government is well advised to retain them in order
to encourage increased supply of marketed production to arrest the
declining trend.
Produce Marketing and Input Distribution
2.13      Produce marketing and input distribution in Zambia plays a
critical role in the development of agriculture in view of the fact that
only when a reliable marketing system is assured can the traditional
farmers be realistically expected to deliberately aim at producing a
surplus over and above their consumption needs. Maize is the most
important among the marketed agricultural products in the country as it is
the main staple food crop cultivated by the majority of the farmers and
consumed heavily both in the urban and rural areas. Varying quantities of
several other food and industrial crops are also marketed but they all rank
far below maIlze in terms of volume, value and strategic importance.
Fertilizerr dominate agricultural input distribution trade. Consequently,
the level of efficiency in the marketing of maize and distribution of



- 14 -
fertilizers is crucial to the welfare of both the Zambian farmers and
consumers. The marketing of maize and distribution of fertilizers are
exclusively undertaken by the National Agricultural Marketing Board
(Namboard) and the cooperatives.
2.14      National Agricultural Marketing Board (Namboard).  Namboard was
established in 1969, as an amalgamation of two crop marketing boards whose
origin goes back to the 1930s. Its main responsibility is to ensure
marketing outlets for the maize surplus regions, adequate and equitable
supply in the deficit regions, and availability of fertilizers in all parts
of the country. Following its establishment, Namboard rapidly expanded its
functions and geographical coverage by taking on the marketing of several
crops (sunflowers, soyabeans, groundnuts, rice, wheat, seeds, and
vegetables), and distribution of other inputs (pesticides and farm
implements). The rapid expansion made Namboard an unwieldy organization
and took a heavy toll on its efficiency as it became increasingly difficult
to attract and retain competent staff in view of the acute shortage of
trained manpower in the country. Until recently, its operations were very
diverse and complex.
2.15      The most critical problems that Namboard has had to face have
been beyond its control. In many respects, it has been treated like a
governmental department subject to ministerial directives on matters which
are normally entrusted fully to the chief executive of a corporate body.
Both the buying and the selling prices for the various commodities it
deals with are determined by the Government, with inadequate regard to the
need to cover costs. Thus, it has been forced to buy at higher prices than
it is allowed to sell, and to expand its operations -all over the country,
irrespective of financial implications arising therefrom. Being heavily
dependent on subsidies, its ability to meet its financial obligations to
third parties, to adopt efficient staffing and other normal business
policies and practices, and to procure and distribute goods in a timely
manner is conditioned by the timing and the ability of the Government to
make budgetary funds available.  Namboard has been running at mounting
deficits, rising from an annual average of K 19.2 million during 1970-74 to
K 87.5 million during 1980-82 (equivalent to about 11% of the total budget
deficit in 1982), with the sharpest increase occurring in 1975, following

2.16      Recently, the Government initiated several measures, especially
since 1982, which have helped to significantly reverse the past rising
trend of subsidies to Namboard. These measures have included: increasing
Namboard's resale prices for maize to equal the prices it pays to
producers; hiving-off its intra-provincial operations and handing them over
to the Provincial Cooperative Unions (PCUs); and reducing Namboard's
staff. The transfer of intra-provincial functions to PCUs was virtually
completed by mid-1983. Henceforth, Namboard's main functions are to
purchase maize from PCUs in the maize surplus provinces, or to import it,
and to sell it to PCUs in the deficit province; to import fertilizers and
distribute them to PCUs; and to maintain maize security reserves. Namboard
has consequently become a more manageable body and has been able to reduce
its staff from a total of about 6,000 in 1979 to about 2,000 in 1983. As a
result, Namboard's losses and, in turn, subsidies fell from K 109.7 million
in 1980 to K 84.3 million in 1982, with a further estimated reduction to K
35.8 million in 1983 (Table 2.4). The remaining subsidies are now due to
the fact that the Government controlled price structure for maize and
fertilizers does not allow any margins to cover transport and other
marketing costs.   As noted above, under the proposed Project, the
Government would take appropriate measures to rectify the situation (para
3.07 (a) ).

2.17      Provincial Cooperative Unions (PCUs): While potentially capable
of playing a significant role with regard to agricultural marketing, input
distribution, as well as credit delivery and recovery, the cooperatives in
Zambia have remained basically weak. Their organizational structure starts
with primary societies at the village level; the societies group themselves
at the provincial level to form nine Provincial Cooperative Unions (PCUs)
which, in turn, constitute the apex organization, the Zambia Cooperative
Federation (ZCF), at the country level. The Ministry of Cooperatives
(MOC), established in 1983, is responsible for promoting cooperative
development, and for ensuring compliance with cooperative laws and
principles. The major functions now carried out by PCUs are: purchasing,
collecting, transporting, storing and selling farm produce, and
distributing farm inputs, notably fertilizers. All the PCUs have been
operating at substantial losses and depend heavily on subsidies from the
Government. Mainly as a result of taking over Namboard's intra-provincial
functions but also because of the higher cost of imported maize, subsidies
to PCUs virtually doubled within two years from K 30.6 mlllion in 1981 to K
57.8 million in 1982, and while the amount budgeted for 1983 is
considerably lower than in 1982, it is still about 20% above the 1981 level
(Table 2.5). Although the hiving-off of Namboard's intra-provincial
functions to PCUs is a move in the right direction in principle, it has led
to a very rapid expansion of PCUs operations without a corresponding
improvement in their managerial and operational capabilities, thereby
running the high risks that, like Namboard, many of the PCUs, especially
the new ones, will find their operations ballooned to enormous proportions
too complex and unwieldy to manage efficiently. Except in the Southern,
Eastern and Northern provinces, PCUs are relatively new, and have little
experience in handling large volumes of business as they now must do. All
PCUs suffer from inability to attract and retain competent staff, weak
operational and financial management and inadequate capital.

to avoid falling into the same problems that plague Namboard.  Uneconomic
depots previously operated by Namboard are being closed down while others

seasons, and manned on part-time basis; also, the PCUs have refrained from
absorbing the entire number of personnel laid off by Namboard, in most
cases absorbing only about 35-40% of such personnel. Furthermore, in view
of the acute shortage of qualified and experienced manpower in Zambia,
steps were recently initiated to provide centralized services to the PCUs,
under the auspices of the National Federation of Cooperatives, in all
aspects of cooperatives' operations, and some bilateral assistance has
already been secured for the purpose. Several measures are required to
improve PCU's operational and financial efficiency; they include: improved
management and financial control through training of cooperative officials
and intensified supervision; institution of sound accounting and timely
management information; and, above all, provisions of adequate trading
margins, based on a thorough analysis of the cost structure facing the
various PCUs, to cover all marketing costs and allow for a reasonable
return on capital and management so that PCUs can become financially
independent. The proposed Project would assist the Government to review
the operations of PCUs for the purpose of identifying and implementing
various measures to improve their operational and financial efficiency as
well as making them financially self-dependent (para 3.07(a) and paras 3.11
and 3.12).
2.19      Private Sector and Competition.  Unlike several other African
countries, Zambia las not gone so far as to discourage or wholly exclude
private traders in the marketing of agricultural commodities and
distribution of farm inputs. Private traders are not allowed in the
marketing of maize and distribution of fertilizers; they, however, play the
major role in the marketing of cassava, millet, sorghum, rice, sunflower
seeds, soyabeans, various livestock products, and fruits and vegetables.
Similarly, private enterprise predominates the distribution of agro-
chemicals, and farm machinery and implements. Now that the Government
has to reduce subsidies, and given the need to improve efficiency in the
agricultural marketing system,the opportunity has come to permit the
private sector to play a greater role in the marketing of maize and
distribution of fertilizers, in order to tap additional development
resources from private sources and to foster competition with a view to
spurring Cooperatives and Namboard to higher levels of efficiency. Under
the proposed Project, the Government would take appropriate measures to
this end (para 3.07 td) and para 3.11).
Research and Extension Services
2.20      The bulk of the available technological packages remains largely
unsuited to the needs of the smallholders in general and of subsistence
farmers in particular. Insufficient attention has been given to crops
grown mainly by subsistence farmers such as cassava, sorghum and millet,
which account for about 40X of the total cropped area in the country; to
the inter-cropping and shifting cultivation systems prevailing among these
farmers; and to practical ways of increasing productivity within the
constraints imposed by the labor, managerial skills, and capital resources
at the disposal of these farmers. Partly as a result of the technological
constraints, the preponderant proportion of Zambia's agriculture is
characterized by low productivity, both per unit of labor and land; for
example, the average maize yields among traditional farmers, who account



- 18 -
for 85X of the total maize acreage, is estimated at 0.9 tons/ha compared to
an average of 2.4 tons/ha among the emergent farmers and 5 tons/ha among
the large-scale commercial farmers.   For the majority of the smallholders,
there is hardly any technical message which, at present, the extension
staff can convey with confidence. There is therefore an urgent need to
develop proven technical messages which are location-specific, and which
take into account the regional comparative advantages, labor availability,
management capability, financial and other production resources at the
disposal of the majority of the Zambian farmers. Like research, extension
services in Zambia have been geared mainly to the commercial farmers along
the line-of-rail. In addition, extension efforts have been seriously
hampered by inadequate funding, shortage of qualified and experienced
staff, and inadequate logistic support. The Government is now in the
process of preparing a long-term program to improve research and extension
services, and to re-orient these services to the needs of the smallholders.
2.21      Partly due to poor technical guidance and weak extension
services, Zambia uses an extraordinarily high amount of fertilizers for a
country of its agricultural size. For example, during 1980/81, it
estimated to have consumed about 74,000 tons of nitrogenous and phosphate
fertilizers which is only slightly below Kenya's consumption estimated at
79,000 tons despite the fact that Zambia's grain production was only
one-third of Kenya's production. The Government is most concerned about
this situation but little has been done to identify the underlying factors
and possible solutions; a study recently carried out by USAID appears to
have been inadequate to lead to any significantly effective solutions. The
proposed Project would require a thorough analysis of the problem and would
provide for consultation with IDA regarding implementation of the findings
(para 3.07(f) ). On the other hand, and because of the shortage of foreign
exchange, import of the various types of agro-chemicals, such as pesti-
cides, and of miscellaneous requisite items, notably produce and input
packaging materials, has fallen below the mirimum levels. For example, in
1982, only K 3.2 million of agro-chemicals was imported out of the required
K 5.0 million as estimated by the agro-chemical dealers 2/; locally
manufactured fertilizer has frequently remained undistriluted to the
farmers because of lack of packaging material, and farmers are reported to
be facing a similar problem regarding packaging of farm produce.   The
proposed Project would accordingly help to finance agro-chemicals and such
other miscellaneous inputs (Table 3.1).
Agricultural Credit
2.22      Credit, in the strict sense, is not a major constraint in
Zambia. The preponderant majority of the Zambian farmers, consisting of
subsistence farmers, has had virtually no effective demand for credit
because of the absence of attractive technological packages. However,
bridging funds to finance the purchasing of produce and inputs by Namboard
and PCUs is already an important problem, stemming primarily from the
Government's pricing policy which has weakened Namboard's and PCUs' finan-
cial conditions to an extent that has made them uncreditworthy in the eyes
of the commercial banks, and consequently heavily dependent on the

1981-82 is estimated as follows (K 'million):   1981   1982

Government to provide such funds or to guarantee loans from commercial
banks. The budgetary crisis facing the Government has made it increasingly
difficult to obtain the needed funds or guarantee in a timely manner.
Consequently, delays in paying the farmers have become increasingly
frequent and longer, often extending to six months. This has caused cash
flow problems down the marketing chain, as Namboard is unable to pay PCUs
and PCUs in turn unable to pay the farmers, thereby artificially increasing
the demand for credit at the farm level among the emergent and commercial
farmers. It has also resulted in a disincentive to producers in terms of
the increased opportunity cost of the delayed receipts.
2.23      For the market-oriented farmers, the required amount of credit
has been generally available from commercial banks and governmental lending
institutions. A recent study of the agricultural credit situation in
Zambia indicated that the credit is not a major constraint to these farmers
and estimated that the existing financial institutions readily extend about
K 99 million, about 47% of which consisted of medium- and long-term loans,
or about 70% of the estimated financial resources needed for the on-farm
development requirements during 1980-81. Reports of the Commercial Farmers
Bureau also confirm that most of their members have no difficulties
obtaining loans from commercial banks, provided they have viable investment
proposals.
Tillage Power
2.24 Given the ample land resources, an appropriate policy and institu-
tional environment, suitable technological packages, and adequate support
services, tillage power (in terms of labor, animal draft and machine power)
is residually the most binding constraint on agricultural development in
Zambia, for it alone determines the area that a farmer can cultivate and
consequently the amount of surplus he can produce over and above subsis-
tence requirements. The predominant reliance on the hand hoe is one of the
major causes of the under-utilization of the most abundant and cheapest
resource in the country: land. The tillage power constraint is exacerbated
by the fact that, in the agriculturally more important parts of Zambia,
rains are erratic and confined to a period of four to five months, followed
by a long, hot and dry period, thus necessitating hurried land preparation
to avoid late planting because delay in planting for even one week may
result in as much as 50% decline in yields.
2.25      Despite the high rate of unemployment in the country, labor
shortages are a major problem, though the problem takes on different forms
within the three main farming systems. Among the traditional farmers, who
depend entirely, and the emergent farmers, who depend substantially on
family labor, labor shortages are pronounced during the planting and
harvest seasons; the shortage has been steadily aggravated by the unabated
exodus of the young and able males from the rural to the urban areas to the
extent that, in some rural areas such as Northern Province, the economic-
ally productive population has dropped to about 40%. Although most of the
emergent farmers use oxen or hired tractors for land preparation, labor
constraints on planting, weeding and harvesting significantly inhibit the
realization of the full potential offered by the use of animal draft
power. The labor constraint manifests itself more pronouncedly in



- 20 -
influencing the type and range of crops these farmers choose to produce,
leading the farmer to allocate more of the available production resources
to the cultivation of crops such as maize which have the double advantage
of being a less labor-intensive and sta.le food crop compared to crops such
as tobacco and groundnuts. Among the medium and large scale commercial
farmers, the labor constraint manifests itself primarily in terms of labor
costs which rose sharply during the 1970s due to the introduction of
statutory minimum wage and high housing standards. The result has been a
strong tendency to shift away from the labor-intensive crops such as
tobacco, and to resort to labor-substituting production techniques.
2.26      Efforts to lessen the labor constraint have focussed on promoting
the use of animal and tractor power. Although the country has a sizeable
herd of cattle from which a considerable number of oxen could potentially
be drawn, the use of draft animals is limited by tsetse infestation in some
parts of the country, by the fact that about two-thirds of the potential
oxen remain untrained, and by the fact that a large number of farmers does
not own cattle. Moreover, since the mid-1970's, it has become increasingly
difficult to acquire ox-drawn implements because of the acute shortage of
foreign exchange to finance either imports of the finished implements or
raw materials for local manufacturing. The use of oxen is also rendered
less attractive by the fact that, unlike tractors, the farmer has to await
the onset of the rains to soften the ground before ploughing is possible
and, therefore, the area that can be prepared within the short time
available for the optimal planting is limited.
2.27      Since the early 1950s, tractor power has played a crucial role in
Zambia in expanding the cultivated acreage in general and in ensuring
adequate supply of marketed surpluses to feed the rapidly growing urban
population in particular. Although mainly concentrated among the medium
and large-scale commercial farmers, the use of tractor power has been
spreading steadily among che market-oriented smallholders (emergent
farmers), mainly through the process whereby medium and large-scale farmers
sell used tractors to the more advanced smal-holders. Virtually all of the
medium and large-scale farmers as well as many of the emergent farmers in
Zambia have sufficient farming skills, and fairly suitable technological
package to respond quickly to favorable changes in pricing policies and
other incentives that have taken place recently. Given the ample
availability of land, cultivation power alone prescribes the area these
farmers can plough, plant and weed during the critically short cropping
season. Adequate tractor power is, therefore, crucial to ensuring that
these farmers have the capacity to at least sustain the current level of
production.
2.28.     On the other hand, the acute shortage of foreign exchange has led
to inadequate allocation of resources to farm mechanization 3/; this has
compelled farmers to increasingly defer essential repairs anT replacement
of the existing tractor fleet and associated implements. In physical
terms, tractor imports declined from an annual average of 840 units during
3/ Foreign exchange during 1981-82 is estimted as follows (K 'million):
1981   1982
Tractors        7.8    4.6
Implements      1.4    1.5
9.2    6.1



- 21 -
1970-74 to 490 units during 1975-80, and to 230 units during 1981-82.
Import of essential spare parts has similarly been curtailed as a result of
which it is estimated that about 40Z of the 2,500 operable tractor units in
the country are mostly out of action and, because of frequent breakdowns,
the units cannot cope with an average of more than 40 ha/year.   This had
led to a serious impairment of the existing production capacity (in terms
of already developed land, on-farm fixed assets, and managerial skills)
among the market-oriented farmers, thereby contributing to the declining
output of the marketed production. The proposed Project would help to
finance replacement and rehabilitation of the current stock of tractors and
associated implements, as well as procurement of animal drawn implements
(Table 3.1).
2.29      In an effort to lessen the tillage power constraint among the
majority of the smallholders who, because of their limited financial
resources and the small size of the cultivated area, are unable to
individually own tractors, the Government has been offering tractor hire
services since the late 1960s. However, the Government has refrained from
interfering with the private sector in this respect and farmers and other
individuals who own tractors are free to offer services at whatever price
the market can bear. The Government tractor fleet now consists of about
350 units but most of the equipment is in poor working condition because of
inadequate maintenance and lack of spare parts; only about 280 units are
operational. The Government services have been running at a loss because
the charges are fixed below full cost, estimated at about K 30/hr compared
to the current charges at K 22.0/hr, and have therefore had to be supported
by budgetary subsidies estimated at about K 200,000 during 1983, while the
capital costs has been covered by both bilateral grants and budgetary
subventions. The uneconomic charges have inhibited proper maintenance
thereby widening the cost-recovery gap and making operational efficiency
more difficult to achieve. The Government is in the process of reassessing
and will henceforth periodically review the charges to ensure that they are
adequate to cover all operating plus replacement costs. Under the proposed
Project, the Government would take appropriate measures to this end (para
3.07 (c) }.
C. Foreign Exchange Requirements for Agriculture and Agro-Industries
(1985-87)
2.30      Except those relating to policy and institutional issues, the
abovre constraints involve imported inputs and their solution therefore
calls for foreign exchange resources. Indeed, to play its expected role
effectively, the agricultural sector will require a large injection of
foreign exchange resources. It is estimated that agricultural production,
agro-processing and other agro-related industries in Zambia will require
about US$540 million of foreign exchange during 1985-87 (Table 2.6). This
figure does not include fuel, transport and factor service income and
assumes an increasing supply of locally manufactured fertilizers.

(three for industrial forestry, two for livestock/dairy development, two
for tobacco production, one for coffee production and two area-based
projects for overall agricultural development. The first livestock loan
was cancelled in 1973 at GRZ's request because of pricing problems and poor
management. The dairy project which aims at improving milk production by
smallholder producer was approved in 1982 and has been having initial
implementation problems, especially inadequate funding, and has had to be
scaled down and restructured into a more realistic pilot design. The first
and second industrial forestry projects were relatively well executed; the
third one has just become effective and no serious problems are anticipated
regarding its implementation. The two commercial tobacco farming projects
were completed, but were unsuccessful in meeting their respective objec-
tives of training and establishing Zambian commercial tobacco farmers
and hence raising tobacco production. The projects encountered major



- 23 -
managerial problems and pricing policy issues. The coffee project has been
hampered by cost overruns, and by shortages of foreign exchange and
Government funds. The two area-based agricultural development projects
became effective recently and faced some initial problems relating to
inadequate Government funds and inappropriate pricing policy; these
problems are gradually being resolved. Assistance to agriculture has also
been provided through projects in other sectors. The Fourth Education
Project, for example, had a major component to strengthen the training of
extension staff and farmers; lines of credit to the Development Bank of
Zambia have financed the provision of medium and long-term finance to
commercial farmers. In general inadequate local counterpart funds have
been one of the main problems facing all Bank/IDA-supported projects in
Zambia.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Origin and Design
Origin
3.01      The proposed Project originated fren discussions between Zambian
officials and a Bank mission which visited Zambia in March 1983 in
connection with agricultural sector work. It was prepared jointly by Bank
staff and the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Development (HAWD).
Project Design
3.02      The proposed Project would extend over a period of three years so
as to allow sufficient time for implementation of the envisaged policy and
institutional reforms. The Project's policy and institutional reforms as
well as the thrust of its physical inputs are consistent with the
recommendations of the recent agricultural sector report (Zambia: Policy
Options and Strategies for Agricultural Growth; No. 4764-ZA), carried out
jointly by the Government and the Bank, and which provided the analytical
underpinnings to the Project's proposals. The physical input components
were based on estimates made primarily by the major local suppliers of such
inputs, taking into account the likely effective demand, as opposed to mere
needs, among the various categories of farmers in the country. The total
cost of these inputs is the same as shown in Table 2.6 for agricultural
production, excluding fertilizers and veterinary drugs. Fertilizers were
excluded chiefly because of: (i) easy availability of bilateral assistance;
(ii) the already extraordinarily high consumption of fertilizers; and (iii)
the belief that the most urgent needs are a thorough study to identify the
causes behind the high fertilizer consumption and a program to rehabilitate
the existing facilities for domestic production of fertilizers. Veterinary
drugs were excluded because of the relatively low degree of urgency placed
on livestock compared to crop production. The design sought to balance
short-term measures, consisting of the physical inputs, with policy and
institutional measures aimed principally at improving the performance of
Zambia's agriculture over the medium to the long-term period. To avert
further declines in agricultural production in the immediate future, it is
necessary to not only improve the policy environment but also to ensure



- 24 -
adequate availability of various key inputs to activate utilization of the
existing production capacity so as to enable the farmers to respond to the
improved policy framework.
3.03      Although the long-term growth of Zambia's agriculture depends
on the development of the subsistence and emergent farmers, and despite the
fact that a recent analysis suggests that the medium- and large-scale
farmers are less efficient than the subsistence and emergent farmers with
regard to the use of both the domestic and foreign resources, in the
immediate future Zambia must look to the medium- and large-scale farmers
for a more rapid increase of agricultural productions. The reason is that,
over the short-run, the supply response among subsistence and emergent
farmers will remain low; on the other hand, the medium- and large-scale
farmers are well placed to increase production quickly in response to
improved policy environment because they already possess the requisite
capacity and farming skills, and are already engaged in a farming system
for which fairly suitable technological packages are available. The
relatively low level of efficiency among these farmers is largely attri-
butable to the high rate of protection accorded to them mainly through the
highly subsidized fertilizer prices. tience, by encouraging measures to
eliminate these subsidies, the proposed Project would help to raise the
level of efficiency among these farmers. However, to ensure sustainable
improvement, such measures need to be reinforced by research to increase
crop yields; it is expected that the research and extension project now
under preparation would cater to this need as well as to the needs of
subsistence and emergent farmers (para 2.20).
B. Main Objectives
3.04      The Project's main objectives are to encourage and support the
Government to continue the on-going, and initiate further policy reforms on
issues that have hitherto adversely affected the development of Zambian
agriculture in general and crop production in particular; and to reinforce
Government's efforts to diversify the economy and to reverse the decline in
the marketed agricultural output. The Project would also help to sharpen
the focus of, and to develop a specific program of action for the policy
measures spelt out broadly in the "Memorandum of Development Objectives and
Policies" submitted to the Bank by the Government of Zambia in January 1983
and which, as far as the agricultural sector is concerned, affirms the
Government's commitment to:
(a) provide a system of incentives to producers of agricultural
products, based on a sound price setting methodology, with a view
to facilitating establishment of economic prices and a rational
allocation of resources according to the principle of comparative
advantage among the various regions;
(b) adopt a policy of economic pricing for parastatal enterprises,
and streamline their operations;



- 25 -
(c) increase the efficiency of the marketing system, by allowing a
degree of competition among the official marketing organizations,
cooperatives, and private traders, eventually leading to a system
in which official producer prices would become floor prices and
Namboard would become the buyer and seller of last resort in
support of producer prices at a level that provides adequate
incentives;
(d) strengthen the Agricultural Planning capacity of MAWD to enable
policies to be formulated on the basis of a well defined
agricultural development strategy; and
(e) review the whole range of services available to the smallholder,
particularly extension, research, input supply and marketing
services, for the purpose of identifying existing deficiencies,
and drawing up an action program to rectify such deficiencies.
3.05      The Government has already taken important steps towards
implementation of some of these measures, particularly with regard to
pricing policies, non-price producer incentives, and streamlining the
operations of Namboard. Measures are also underway, following a review and
recommendations by the Bank, to strengthen the Planning Division of MAWD.
A thorough review of the research and extension services is also proceeding
with a view to prepare a possible Bank-supported project to improve these
services. The proposed Project would help the Government to undertake
further policy and institutional reforms (para 3.07) in keeping with the
broad commitments outlined above.
3.06      The Project also aims at enhancing farmers' capacity to increase
aggregate production in response to the on-going and proposed policy and
institutional reforms by ensuring availability of essential inputs. In
addition, it would reinforce revernlent's efforts to diversify the economy
by:
(a) accelerating agricultural growth through a pricing policy
consistent with the varying regional comparative advantages,
leading to a more efficient use of resources; and
(b) helping to release domestic and foreign exchange resources for
use in support of diversification efforts by: reducing fiscal
expenditures through allowing the cooperatives and Namboard
sufficient margins to ensure full cost recovery, thereby
eliminating budgetary subsidies; and reducing expenditures on
imports through increasing production of maize, through
encouraging implementation of measures to reduce the
extraordinarily high consumption of fertilizers, and through
restraining increased consumption of imported wheat products.
3.07      As Annex 1 shows, the Government has already taken several bold
and far reaching measures towards stimulating economic recovery in general
and agricultural growth in particular. Some of these measures are the
result of the conditions attached to the IMF Stand-by arrangements, while
others are the result of the continuing dialogue between the Government and



- 26 -
the Bank. In addition to those shown in Annex 1, since negotiations for
this Project last July, the Government has: (i) decontrolled the price of
wheat products; (ii) increased charges for Government tractor hire
services; (iii) initiated, with Bank support, formulation of a price
setting methodology which would relate controlled prices to the border-
price equivalents; and (iv) commenced a study on Provincial Cooperative
Union costs with a view to providing a firm basis for determining trading
margins that should be allowed to these Cooperatives so as to attain
full-cost recovery. Furthermore, since last May, the Government instituted
a modestly regionally differentiate price structure for maize and wheat
products. The proposed Project would seek to encourage the Government to
take further specific measures in accordance with the details and
implementation schedule set forth in Annex 3, summarized as follows:
(a) allow Namboard and Cooperatives trading margins sufficient to
attain full-cost recovery with regard to maize marketing and
fertilizer distribution, within a regionally differentiated price
structure and related to border price equivalents (para 6.02
fb) );
(b) undertake an action-oriented study regarding ways and means to
improve efficiency of Namboard and PCUs in the marketing of maize
and distribution of fertilizers, (paras 6.03 (b), 6.04 (b), 6.05
(a), and 6.06 (a) );
(c) adjust and maintain the charges for the Government tractor hire
services at a level sufficient to ensure full cost recovery (para
6.02 (a) );
(d) allow a broader-based participation by private traders in the
marketing of maize and the distribution of fertilizer (para 6.06
(a) );
Ce) undertake a thorough assessment of the factors underlying the
extraordinarily high consumption of fertilizers, and discuss the
findings with IDA with a view to agreeing on recommendations to
be implemented and an implementation schedule for such
recommendations (paras 6.03 (e) and 6.04 (a) ); and
(f) adopt a pricing setting methodology for producer and fertilizer
prices, which relates such prices to the border-price equivalents
{para 6.03 (a) ).
3.08      At negotiations, assurance was obtained from the Government that
these measures would be carried out in accordance with the details and
implementation schedule set out in Annex 3 (paras 6.02 to 6.07).
C. Project Description
Physical Production Inputs
3.09      The physical inputs that would be eligible for IDA financing
would be as follows:



- 27 -
(a)   Farm Machinery and Implements: new tractors; mechanically powered
and animal drawn machinery and implements for land preparation,
sowing, weeding, fertilizer and agro-chemical spreading or
spraying, and for crop harvesting; ox-carts; and spare parts;
(b) Agro-chemicals: various crop protection chemicals and
herbicides;
(c) Miscellaneous: agricultural hand tools, bags for packaging
fertilizer and grain; improved seeds; small-scale irrigation
pumps and fittings; and farm trucks and trailers; and
(d)  Consultancy: about 27.5 man-months of internationally recruited
specialists to carry out an agricultural marketing study.
Agro-chemicals known to damage the environment would not be eligible for
IDA financing.
Studies
3.10      Some of the Project's policy and institutional measures, namely
those aimed at improving fertilizer usage, allowing margins to cooperatives
and Namboards, and promoting a broad-base participation by private traders
in maize marketing and fertilizer distribution, require further and
detailed analysis before implementation. Work is already well underway
towards the formulation of a price setting methodology that would relate
producer prices to the border-price equivalents for implementation within
six months after project effectiveness (para 6,03 (a) ). With regard to
improving fertilizer usage, a study carried out in 1983 through bilateral
assistance (USAID) did not come up with effective solutions to the problem
and a further study, again with bilateral assistance, would be carried out
during the first half of 1985 (para 6.03 (c). The Government has already
initiated a study of the magnitudes and structure of costs of the nine
PCUs, in accordance with terms of reference acceptable to IDA (Project File
Paper No. 4), for the purpose of establishing an empirical base for
determining the appropriate margins 4/. This study would constitute the
first phase of the study explained iF para 3.11 below, and would entail
about 10.5 man-months of consultancy services; it is expected to be
completed by the second week of March, 1985, and thus on time for the
required action to allow trading margins to PCU and Namboard not later than
May 1985 (para 6.02 (b) ).
3.11      Having identified the nature and magnitudes of PCU's cost, the
above study would be followed by a more comprehensive sttvdy on how to
reduce these costs and create a system that would susr-air. improved level of
efficiency with special reference to the marketing of Ibaize and distri-
bution of fertilizers 4/. While detailed terms of reference for this phase
of the study would be drawn at the completion of the first phase, so as to
take full advantage of the findings therefrom, broadly they would cover:
4/ The Bank's mission on Pricing and Parastatal Efficiency, which visited
Zambia last october, is carrying out a similar exercise with regard to
Namboard. The mission is also assisting in formulation of a price
setting methodology that would relate producer prices to the border-
price equivalents.



- 28 -
(i) ways and means of improving marketing efficiency, especially
through cost reduction, among the Cooperatives and Namboard, with
participation by the private sector acting as an essential spur
to that end;
(ii) legal changes that are needed to facilitate private sector
participation;
(iii) a workable mechanism to guard against wide spread commodity
hoarding and/or smuggling by private traders, and against the
bulk of the trade falling into non-Zambia hands;
(iv) ways and means to improve financial and operational management
among the Cooperatives;
(v) measures needed to enable Namboard to establish and manage food
grain reserves, and to carry out the role of a buyer and seller
of last resort within a system of guaranteed floor and ceiling
prices;
(vi) policy and operational guidelines for the management of food
grain reserves; and
(vii) required investments and financial resources for the operations
of such reserves.
It is estimated that this study would take about six months to complete and
that it would require about 17 man-months of internationally recruited
consultants, comprising specialists in agricultural marketing and input
distribution (six man-months), grain and input storage (three man-months),
cooperative organization and management (three man-months), financial
management (two man-months), and transport (three man-months).
3.12      At negotiations, assurance was obtained from the Government that
the above study would be carried out accordingly and its findings imple-
mented (paras 6.03 (e) and (b); 6.04 (b); 6.05 (a); and 6.06 (a) ).
D. Estimated Costs and Financing Arrangements
Estimated Costs
3.13      The quantities of physical inputs to be financed by the Project
are based on estimates provided by the local major supplies of agricultural
machinery and agro-chemicals; the costs are based on the US dollar prices
prevailing in November 1983, adjusted to reflect the exchange rate at the
beginning of November 1984. The Project total cost is estimated at K 144.6
million, consisting of K 79.8 million for tractors and associated imple-
ments, K 22.8 million for spare parts, K 38.8 million for agro-chemicals,
K 2.8 million for miscellaneous inputs, and K 0.4 million for consultancy
services (Table 3.1). The foreign exchange costs are estimated at K 130.0
million (US$65.0 million) and local costs at K 14.6 million (US$7.3
million). Specific categories have been used for the purpose of estimating



- 29 -
costs; it is expected that Project implementation would permit a large
measure of flexibility to switch funds among the various categories, the
only condition being that the inputs to be financed by IDA are as indicated
above (para 3.09).

Financing Arrangements
3.14      The Project's foreign exchange costs would be financed as
follows: US$25 million, or 38% of the foreign exchange costs, from IDA;
a further US$40.0 million or 62% of foreign exchange costs from co-
financing sources: US$4.8 million from the Swiss Government, US$23.4
million from the African Development Bank; US$5.0 million from USAID, and
US$6.8 million from CIDA (Table 3.2). The local costs, estimated at US$7.3
million, would be financed directly by the farm machinery and agro-chemical
dealers (Trading Houses). The Bank of Zambia (BOZ) would sell to the
Trading Houses foreign exchange made available by the Project and each
Trading House would pay to BOZ the Kwacha equivalent of the full amount of
the foreign exchange cost of the items for which a Trading House is
allocated foreign exchange; the Trading Houses would therefore finance 100%
of the Project costs, though in local currency. The Government intends to
use the local funds generated by the IDA Credit, estimated at K 50 million,
to create a Kwacha Fund to support agricultural development activities
(para 4.09). The IDA Credit would be to the Government of Zambia and would
be subject to the standard IDA terms. To facilitate and early start and,
therefore, a timely completion of the proposed study (para 3.10) provision
would be made for retrospective financing of up to US$80,000 of consultancy
costs incurred after September 1, 1984.

2, Farm machinery and agro-chemical importers.
E. Procurement and Disbursement
Procurement
3.15      Procurement of the goods to be financed by the Project would be
undertaken by Trading Houses already established in Zambia and dealing in
farm machinery and implement, spare parts, and agro-chemicals, and would be
procured through normal commercial channels. All the major international
manufacturers of farm machinery and agro-chemicals are well represented in
Zambia, through the Trading Houses, and are already engaged in a fairly
intense competition for the available market (para 4.06). The Project's
goods would be resold, by the Trading Houses, to farmers who would have
full freedom to choose from which Trading House they purchase their
requirements, taking into account comparative prices, technical suitability
and availability of after-sale services in convenient locations. The
selection and terms of appointment of consultants would be in accordance
with Bank/IDA guidelines.
Disbursement
3.16      Annex 5 shows the estimated disbursement schedule; it differs
from the Bank-wide disbursement profile mainly because the proposed Project
is essentially in the nature of a structural adjustment assistance. The
proceeds of the IDA Credit would finance 100% of the foreign exchange
expenditures for imported farm machinery, spare parts, agro-chemicals, and
miscellaneous items; and 100% of the consultancy service costs.
Disbursements would be fully documented. The Credit would be made
available in two tranches as follows:
(a)  a first tranche of US$10 million upon Project effectiveness;
and
(b)  a second tranche of US$15 million within 15 months following
Project effectiveness, and upon IDA's satisfaction that the
Government has:



- 31 -
(i) adjusted and maintained the structure of maize and fertilizer
prices to allow sufficient margins to cover at least
two-thirds of the amount needed to attain full-cost recovery
within a regionally differentiated price structure and
related to border price equivalents;
(ii) adjusted and maintained charges for Government tractor hire
services at a level sufficient to ensure full cost recovery;
(iii) adopt a pricing methodology for producer prices, which
relates such prices to border price equivalents as relevant;
and
(iv) completed interim report of the proposed study on the
marketing of maize and distribution of fertilizers (para
3.11);
3.17       To facilitate disbursement for the eligible goods and services
other than the consultancy services, the Government would open and maintain
a Special Account, in the Bank of Zambia, under terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA, into which IDA would, upon Project effectiveness and
receipt of withdrawal application, deposit a sum of US$3 million
(equivalent to about 3 months of imports of the eligible goods); thereafter
IDA would periodically replenish the Special Account upon receipt and
approval of borrower's application, subject to: (i) the maximums-set by the
above tranching arrangement and a minimum of US$20,000 equivalent per each
replenishment application ; and (ii) evidence satisfactorily showing that
the expenditures paid out of the Special Account were eligible for
financing by the Project. The establishment of the Special Account would
be a condition of Project effectiveness (para 6.07 (a) (i) ).
F. Accounts, Audit and Reporting
3.18      The Bank of Zambia (for activities other than those related to
the proposed study) and the Government through MAWD (for the proposed
study) would maintain separate records and accounts which would be audited
by independent auditors acceptable to IDA and submitted to IDA not later
than four months following the end of the financial year. The auditor's
report would include specific comments as to whether the proceeds of the
IDA Credit have been used in accordance with the agreed purposes and
manner, and whether allocation of foreign exchange among the various
Trading Houses reflects the nature and the volume of business normally
carried out by the concerned. Trading Houses. BOZ and MAWD would also
maintain adequate records, in a manner and detail to be agreed with IDA, to
facilitate a close monitoring of the implementation of the Project, and
would prepare and submit to IDA a quarterly progress report and a final
Project Completion Report.
G. Relations with the IMF
3.19      Annex 1 shows the relationship between the proposed Project and
the stipulations of the IMF stand-by arrangements. The Project would
complement the IMF's conditions by: (i) requiring the Government to allow



- 32 -
Namboard and the Cooperatives sufficient margins to eliminating subsidies,
thus helping to reduce budgetary expenditures and deficits; (ii) stimula-
ting increased production of the major staple food crops and domestic
supply of industrial raw materials, thus helping to mitigate decline in
living standards likely to result from the recent devaluation of the Kwacha
and the measures to restrain wage increases. In addition, it would
contribute towards improving the balance of payments by helping to stave
off the need to import staple food commodities, and by encouraging the
Government to implement measures to reduce the extraordinarily high
consumption of fertilizers.
IV. IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Overall Responsibility
4.01      The Bank of Zambia (BOZ) would be responsible for implementing
and managing the Project's aspects other than those relating to the
proposed study, while the Government through MAWD would be similarly
responsible for the proposed study. For the non-study aspects of the
Project, and before Project effectiveness, the Government would establish a
Project Implementation Committee (PIC) consisting of representatives of the
Ministry of Finance (MOF), Agriculture and Water Development (MAWD),
Commerce and Industry (MCI), National Commission for Development Planning
(NCDP), small-scale and commercial farmers, and the Project Executive
Officer (para 4.04). PIC's main functions would be:
(a)   laying down overall procedures of managing the activities
financed by the proposed Project, and ensuring that such
procedures are consistent with the Credit Agreement between IDA
and the Government of Zambia;
(b)   Approving applications from various Trading Houses after
reviewing them to ensure that: (i) the applications are in
conformity with the objectives of the Credit Agreement;
(ii) allocations of Project funds are in accordance with agri-
cultural priorities as set by the Government of Zambia and in
accordance with eligibility for IDA financing; (iii) allocations
of Project funds to individual applicants are consistent with the
type and the volume of business normally carried out by the
applicant during the past six years prior to Project
effectiveness; (iv) specifications of goods to be imported are
sufficiently clear and reflect the prevailing scarcity in the
country; and (v) prices quoted for similar items by the various
Trading Houses are competitive;
{c)   ensuring that all qualifying applicants comply fully with the
terms and conditions stipulated in the agreement between BOZ and
Trading Houses (para 4.06) and that appropriate action is taken
against non-complying Trading Houses;



- 33 -
(d)   ensuring that foreign exchange allocated to the various Trading
Houses and the type of imports are immediately publicized through
the local press (para 4.04(a) ).
(e)   ensuring coordination between its activities and those of the
general foreign exchange allocation committee.
4.02      At negotiations, assurance was secured from the Government that a
Project Implementation Committee (PIC) would be established in a manner and
for the functions as specified above (para 6.07 (a) (ii) ).
4.03      BOZ has already worked out a set of criteria, taking into account
the type and volume of business that the Trading Houses have been regularly
carrying out during the past six years, for allocating foreign exchange
among interested Trading Houses; has designed a proforma agreement between
BOZ and Trading Houses; and has submitted the criteria and proforma agree-
ment to IDA and both are acceptable to IDA (para 6.07 (b) (i) ).
B. Project Implementation Unit
4.04      BOZ would also establish, before the Project becomes effective, a
full-time Project Implementation Unit (PIU), which would be headed by a
Project Executive Officer (PEO) with qualifications and experience accep-
table to IDA, staffed adequately, and provided with adequate facilities and
logistic support. The costs relating to PIU would be financed by the local
funds generated by the Project. PIU would be responsible for the day-to-
day operations, specifically:
(a)   evaluating and processing applications from Trading Houses for
the allocation of foreign exchange in a manner that would enable
PIC to readily arrive at sound decisions;
(b)   liaising with the officials of the Ministry of Commerce and
Industry to ensure that import licenses are issued promptly to
the eligible Trading Houses;
(c)   closely monitoring the activities and transactions of the. Project
to ensure that Trading Houses are complying fully with
stipulations of the agreement between them and BOZ (para &.05);
(d)   maintaining records adequate to show the uses of the proceeds of
the Credit, project's costs and, where appropriate, benefits;
(e)   publishing in the local press, within seven working days
following the decision by PIC, the foreign exchange and types of
imports allocated to the various Trading Houses; and
(f)   preparing and submitting quarterly and other reports to IDA.
4.05      At negotiations, assurance was obtained from the Government that
BOZ would establish a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in the manner and
for the functions as specified above (para 6.07 (b), (iii) ).

C. Trading Houses
4.06      Importation of the goods financed by the proposed Project would
be undertaken by Trading Houses consisting of frrm machinery and agro-
chemicals dealers located In Zambia. There X   nine large Trading Houses
and four small ones dealing in farm machinery and spare parts, and five
major ones dealing in agro-chemicals. Each Trading House represents
several manufacturers, on an agent basis, and most of them have branches or
sub-agents in the main urban centres. Under the proposed Project, each
Trading House wishing to participate in Project activities would enter into
a formal agreement with BOZ, stipulating, inter-alia, that:
(a)  all goods financed by the Project would be sold to bona-fide
farmers or buyers who would use these goods to serve the needs of
such farmers in Zambia;
(b)   applications for allocation of foreign exchange would be
accompanied by proforma invoices sufficiently showing specifi-
cations, quantities and unit prices (c.i.f. Lusaka) of the goods
to be imported;
(c) in all cases where the concerned goods are of the same
technical specification and delivery dates are comparable,
foreign exchange allocation would be made in preference of the
Trading House quoting the lowest price as shown in proforma
iuvoices;
Cd)  Trading Houses or their agencies would: (i)not require repairs to
be done in their workshop as a condition of selling spare parts;
(ii) stock sufficient spare parts up-country; (iii) publicize in
local press, farmers' and cooperatives' newsletters, retail
prices of aUl imported items financed by the Project and
retailing for K 500 and above per standard unit, at least once a
year and any time the retail prices change by a percentage to be
agreed between BOZ and Trading Houses; (iv) maintain and submit
to PIC on quarterly basis a summary of sales of goods financed
under the Project, classified according to the type of goods; (v)
as may be relevant, periodically orgAnize short courses and field
demonstration days, in such places as may be agreed with MAWD, to
train farmers and operators in farm machinery operation and
maintenance; (vi) submit to PIC, immediately upon receipt from
the suppliers, shipping and other relevant documents in respect
of all goods financed by the Project; and (vii) allow on-the-spot
inspection, by BOZ or its representatives, of the goods procured
under the Project;
(e)  Trading Houses would be responsible for directly paying the local
costs and would, before obtaining an import license, deposit with
BOZ the Kwacha equivalent of the c.i.f. cost of goods to be
imported;



- 35 -
(f)  Any balance of foreign exchange allocations which remins unused
after a period of one month would automatically revert to a pool
for re-allocation to those Trading Houses that have fully
utilized their allocation;
(g) each Trading House would prepare and submit to PIC: (i) before
approval of the first application for foreign exchange
allocation: projections of total agricultural imported inputs it
expects to import during the following three years, detailed as
may be required by PIC; (ii) by the end of October each year:
revised estimates of such imports for the immediately succeeding
calendar year, broken down into quarterly projections; (iii) by
the end of February, May, August, and November of each year
during the life of the Project: actual sales of goods financed by
the Project during the preceding quarter;
(h)  foreign exchange and types of imports allocated to each Trading
House would be published in the local press within seven days
following the decision on the matter by PIC and any Trading
House may lodge objections if it considers that the allocation
to it is unfair; and
(i) upon request, PIC would make available to any participating
Trading House copies of documents relating to any application for
which foreign exchange has been allocated under the Project.
4.07      At negotiations, assurance was obtained from the Government that
BOZ would ensure that a legally binding agreement substantially reflecting
all the above points would be drawn up, and that BOZ would submit a copy of
the proforma agreement to IDA for comments prior to project effectiveness
(para 6.07 (b), (iii) ).                              -
D.  Kwacha Fund
4.09      MAWD considers it most important that arrangements are made,
without involving IDA, to create a Kwacha Fund from the local currency
(amounting to about K 50 million in three years) generated by the IDA
Credit. To this end, it is envisaged that BOZ would, upon Project
effectiveness, open and maintain a separate Kwacha Fund Account in favor of
the Ministry of Finance (MOF), which would o. reflected by a Special
Account in the national budget in a manner and details sufficient to
identify its use. The Fund would be used, wholly or partly depending on
the need, to support agricultural projects and programs, including, if
necessary, credit to farmers who may need loans to purchase farm machinery
and implerents under the proposed Project. A modest amount from the Fund
would be used to defray the costs incurred by PIU in connection with the
management of the Project activities. MAWD and MOF would draw up a set of
criteria for determining which projects and programs to support from the
Kwacha Fund. Such criteria would give primary consideration to economic
and financial justification and pay special attention to: addressing the



- 36 -
needs of subsistence and emergent farmers; promoting non-traditional
agricultural exports; enhancing the capacity of MAWD to utilize the
available manpower and physical resources more effectively; and
facilitating implementation of various projects or programs for which a
lack of local funds prevents the use of available foreign exchange
resources.
4.10      It is further envisaged that the Fund would be administered by a
Kwacha Fund Committee (KFC), to be established within three months
following Project effectiveness, under the chairmanship of the Permanent
Secretary, MAWD, with a membership consisting of representatives of MOF,
BOZ, and NCDP. KFC's main functions would be to determine which projects
and programs to be financed, and how much to be allocated to each case out
of the Kwacha Fund, and to ensure a timely release of funds to the
beneficiary projects and programs.
4.11       To ensure additionality to the sector, KFC would in each case
restrict the use of the Fund to the financing of local expenditures over
and above the amounts actually covered by local funds in the financial year
immediately preceding the year in which the project or program is to
receive support from the Fund. To this end and before making allocations
from the Fund, KFC would, through the Budget Section of MAWD, determine the
actual local funds contributed accordingly, estimate local expenditures for
the next three years or so, and revise such estimates annually in time for
inclusion in the national budget for the immediately succeeding financial
year. Authorization to release funds from the Kwacha Fund would be
signified by vouchers or checks countersigned by the Permanent Secretaries
of MAWD and MOF.
V. Benefits, Justifications and Risks
A. Main Benefits
5.01      Data is not readily available to allow a meaningful, detailed
assessment of the benefits likely to result from the various policy and
institutional reforms under the proposed Project. However, it is realistic
to expect that these reforms would have a considerable and positive impact
on agricultural development by facilitating the achievement of the
objectives set out above (para 3.06), and by strengthening the Government's
capacity to sustain the on-going policy changes. In conjunction with
measures being promoted by the IMF, the reforms constitute a critical
component of the strategies to place Zambia's economy on the road to
recovery, diversification, and growth (para 3.18).
5.02      Lack of reliable data also partly makes it difficult to quantify
accurately the benefits anticipated from the physical inputs to be financed
by the proposed Project. While the farm machinery and implements financed
by the Project would certainly help to increase output by enabling the
cultivation of an acreage larger than is now the case, and would probably
lead to higher yields as a result of better and timely seedbed preparation,
and while the various agro-chemicals would help to increase production by



- 37 -
reducing crop losses, it is very difficult to separate these benefits from
those attributable to the other key inputs, such as fertilizers, farm
management skills, better seeds, which would not be financed by the
proposed Project but without -hich the Project's inputs would achieve
little. In addition, it is problematical to define the "without case"
primarily because a number of options are available to the majority of the
farmers who are expected to benefit from the Project. These options
include: shifting out of crop farming, wholly or partially, to less
input-intensive and less mechanized farming operations and activities such
as ranching or tree farming; continue farming but on a reduced crop area
proportional to the available farm machinery; or going out of business
altogether and selling out to those ("emergent") farmers who might be able
to operate without the use of tractors. In reality, the "without case- is
likely to involve a combination of all these options in proportions that
are not possible to determine objectively. However, all these options have
one feature in common: they would result in reduced cropped area and crop
production. Several difficulties also preclude an accurate and objective
determination of the benefits to be expected from the "with case", largely
because it is not known accurately how the Project's proceeds would be
distributed among the various types of crops, other agricultural
activities, and categories of farmers; or how the Government would use the
Kwacha funds generated by the Project.
5.03      Nonetheless, to gain some notion of the magnitude of the possible
impact on production arising from the Project, an indicative assessment of
the financial and economic costs and benefits has been carried out on the
cultivation of hybrid maize. The following are the main assumptions:
(a) for both without and with project cases:
(i) tractors are used by the medium-, large-scale and the more
advanced emergent farmers;
(ii) in keeping with the estimated percentage of the cultivated
area allocated to maize growing by the medium- and
large-scale farmers, 75Z of the tractor time is devoted to
maize production;
(iii) seasonal inputs, including agro-chemicals, are applied in
accordance with recommended dosages; and
(iv) average maize yields remain at the current level of 4.7
tons/ha, currently attained by improved farmers.
(b) for the without project case:
(i) the existing fleet of 2,500 operational tractor units would
be scrapped after ten ye.:^rs of use from the year Lhey were
imported; and
(ii) because of frequent breakdowns at the critical land
preparation, planting and weeding period, each tractor unit
would handle an average of 40 ha annually;



- 38 -
(c) for the with project case:
(1) all tractors ten years and older, estimated at 1,000 out of
the 2,500, would be replaced, while the remainder would be
rehabilitated;
(ii) the new tractor units would handle 50 ha annually up to the
seventh year and 40 ha thereafter, while the rehabilitated
ones would handle 50 ha annually up to the fifth year and 40
ha thereafter;
(iii) incremental tractor units would necessitate expanding
cultivation into already destumped fallow land; and
(iv) the total Project's cost is charged to maize cultivation.
5.04      Under these assumptions, the Project would increase maize produc-
tion by an amount rising from about 30,000 tons in Year 1 to a peak of
about 320,000 tons in Year 10. Over the Project's economic life of twelve
years, the incremental production would average about 190,000 tons annually
which, at the current prices, is equivalent to K 59.8 million gross. The
present value of the net benefits discounted at 13.5% would be K 34.3
million (US$17.2 million). The financial rate of return is estimated at
27% and the economic rate of return at 59% (Annex 4, Tables 1 and 2). In
reality, the return would be much higher than indicated by these figures
(para 5.05). The financial rate of return is particularly sensitive to
changes in costs and benefits (Table 5.1), reflecting the fact, mainly as a
result of the subsequent devaluation of the Kwacha, the latest increase in
producer price of maize offers a relatively modest profit margin while it
has led to a substantial widening of the gap between domestic and border
prices. The latter problem is expected to be rectified by the adoption of
a better price setting methodology starting with the next cropping season
(Para 6.03 (a) ). Farmers' respresentatives and the Government have
already initiated a review of maize producer price with a view to effecting
an increase during the current cropping season.

5.05      The other reason why the financial rate of return are so
sensitive is that the analysis includes the total capital costs relating to
the tractor units, while the benefits are predicated on 75% of the tractor
units" time. In addition, the analysis does not take into account
increased yields likely to result from timely land preparation, planting
and weeding facilitated by the new and rehabilitated tractor units, and
from the improved availability of agro-chemicals. Annex 4, Table 3(2)
shows the results when the costs are adjusted to exclude 25Z of the tractor
units' capital costs. This adjustment leads to a significant improvement
of the financial rate of return (Table 5.2).

B. Main Direct Beneficiaries
5.06      The envisaged policy and institutional reforms would benefit a
wide spectrmm of the Zambian farmers, including subsistence farmers on the
verge of entering the market economy. The major part of the tractor units
and agro-chemicals would go to the medium- and large-scale farmers;
however, assuming that farmers would buy these inputs in proportions that
reflect the current ownerhsip of tractors, about 20% of these inputs would
benefit the emergent farmers. In addition, about 7,000 emergent farmers
would benefit from ox-drawn implements financed by the Project.
C. Maize Producer Incentive and Fertilizer Subsidies
5.07      The issue arises whether the proposed elimination of subsidies on
fertilizers would seriously reduce producer incentives, particularly for
maize. A full answer to the question calls for a comparative analysis of
returns from the various farming and non-farming investment opportunities
available to the Zambian maize farmers; such an analysis is beyond the
scope of this report. During the past two years, the Government has been
reducing fertilizer subsidies gradually and the remaining subsidies are at
present estimated at about 5% of the fertilizer total costs (procurement
and distribution costs and overheads). Annex 4, Table 3(3) presents a
sensitivity analysis of the financial rate of return for maize with respect



- 40 -
to the cost of fertilizers. An increase of fertilizer prices by, for
example, 10% would still leave an attractive rate of return of about 24%;
furthermore, for the rate of return to fall below the estimated opportunity
cost of capital (13.5%), fertilizer prices would have to increase by about
45%. Since the remaining fertilizer subsidies are less than 10% of full
costs, the analysis suggests that the subsidies can be eliminated without
resulting in a serious disincentive to maize producers.
D. Risks
5.08      The Project's main risks relate to delays or failure to carry out
the proposed policy reforms; lack of foreign exchange to finance inpurs,
especially fertilizers, complementary to those financed by the proposed
Project; and recurrence of droughts. Several of the policy reform
measures, especially those concerning pricing policies and private sector
participation in the marketing system, call for bold and resolute actions
in the face of probably strong and widespread resistance from those who
stand to be adversely affected, particularly the urban population and the
doctrinaire politicians. It is, however, encouraging that the Government
has already demonstrated its resolve to take unpopular measures. Partly
because of the grim economic and financial prospects confronting the
country in the absence of the required policy changes, the political will
now exist to make it realistic to expect that the Government would make
determined efforts to implement the reforms proposed under the Project.
The risk that lack of foreign exchange may lead to inadequate availability
of fertilizers is expected to be minimized by the on-going efforts to
increase local production of fertilizers, and by the fact that fertilizers
are one of the inputs for which Zambia has found relatively easy to obtain
aid from bilateral sources in the past; at negotiations, the Government
confirmed availability of such assistance. In the short- to medium-term,
little can be done about droughts. For the long-run period, research is
proceeding with a view to developing more drought resistant crop varieties
and farming techniques.
E. Justification of IDA Assistance
5.09      Zambia will continue to face severe' foreign exchange constraints
during the remainder of the decade (Table 1.3). The country will therefore
continue to be in great need of support from the international community to
ensure reasonable prospects that the on-going economic . covery measures
will succeed. Apart from the expected benefits from the proposed Project,
IDA support is justified by the facts that:
(a)   the physical inputs to be financed by the Project call for a
substantial multilateral as opposed to just bilateral assistance
in order to facilitate unencumbered procurement from the
least-cost suppliers, free of ties to any one specific country.
One of the problems facing farm mechanization in Zambia is the
increasingly large number of different makes of machinery and
equipment, as a result of tied bilateral assistance, which
renders maintenance and repairs more costly;



- 41 -
(b)   the objectives of the proposed Project bear significantly on the
success of the on-going and future Bank/IDA supported
agricultural projects in Zambia; and
(c)   there are reasonable prospects of IDA successfully encouraging
the Government to carrying out further policy and institutional
reforms as envisaged under the Project.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A. Agreements Reached
6.01      The main issues that call for formal agreement between the
Government and IDA have been discussed with and essentially accepted by the
Government in the course of preparing and appraising the project. At
negotiations, agreements were reached as shown below:
6.02      Periodically after Project effectiveness, the Government would:
(a)   further adjust, gradually or otherwise, hire charges for the
Government tractor services, to achieve full cost recovery not
later than end of August 1986, and thus maintain such charges
thereafter;
(b)   allow PCUs and Namboard, with regard to the marketing of maize
and distribution of fertilizers, and within regionally
differentiated price structure, sufficient margins to cover:
(i)   not later than May 1985: at least one-third of the amounts
needed to attain full cost recovery;
(ii) not later than May 1986: at least two-thirds of the amount
similarly needed, and;
(iii) not later than May 1987: the total amount similarly needed.
6.03      Within six months following Project effectiveness the Government
would:
(a)   adopt a pricing methodology for producer prices which relates
such prices to the border-price equivalents as relevant;
(b)   initiate a study with terms of reference as broadly set out in
para 3.11 above; and
(c)   complete a further study of the factors underlying the extraor-
dinarily high consumption of fertilizers, and possible solutions;
and present a specific action plan satisfactory to IDA for imple-
menting the recommendation of the study (para 2.21).



- 42 -
6.04      Within twelve months  following Project effectiveness the
Government would:
(a) initiate implementing the recommendations of the fertilizer
consumption study (para 6.03 (c) above), as may be agreed
following discussions with IDA; and
(b) submit to IDA for review and comments an interim report of the
study proposed under para 6.03 (b) above.
6.05      Within eighteen months following Project effectiveness the
Government would:
(a)   submit to IDA for review and comments the final report of the
study proposed under para 6.03 (b) above.
6.06      Within twenty-four months following Project effectiveness the
Government would;
(a)   implement the recommendations of the study proposed under para
6.03 (b) above, with special reference to improving the effi-
ciency of Namboard and PCUs, and allowing a broad-based parti-
cipation by the private sector in the marketing of maize and
distribution of fertilizers, with Namboard playing the role of
the buyer and seller of last resort.
6.07      Prior to Project effectiveness:
(a) The Government would:
Ci) establish a Special Account in the Bank of Zambia (paxra
3.17);
(ii) establish a Project Implementation Committee (PIC) in the
manner and for the functions set out in paras 4.01;
(b) The Bank of Zambia would:
(i) draw up a set of criteria, taking into account the type and
volume of business that a Trading House has been regularly
carrying out during the past six years, for allocatiig
foreign exchange to the various Trading Houses, and submit it
to IDA for review and comments (para 4.03);
(ii) establish a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in the manner
and for the functions set out in para 4.04, and appoint an
Executive Officer for PIC with qualitifaction and experience
acceptable to IDA (para 4.04); and
(iii) submit to IDA for review and comments a proforma agreement,
entailing the stipulations set out in para 4.06 above,
between BOZ and Trading Houses, and implement the agreement.



- 43 -
B. Recommendations
6.08      Subject to the above agreements, the proposed Project is suitable
for financing by IDA.
VII. CONDITIONS OF EFFECTIVENESS
7.01      The conditions set out in paras 6.06 would constitute conditions
of Project's ei;e;tiveness.

AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION PROJECT
Implementation Schedule for Policy Reforms and Other Measures
1. Pricing Policy
A. Before Board presentation:
(a) increase the price of wheat product by at least 22%, or
decontrol such prices;
(b) increase the charges for Government tractor hire services
to cover at least 50% of the amount needed to attain full
cost recovery; and
(c) formulate a price setting methodology for producer prices
so as to relate such prices to the board-price equivalents;
B. After Project Effectiteness:
Ca) within six (6) months following Project effectiveness:
adopt a pricing methodology for producer prices which relates
such prices to the border-price equivalents as relevant;
(b) further adjust, gradually or otherwise, the price of wheat
products, if not yet decontrolled, and charges 'or Government
tractor hire services to achieve full cost recovery not later
than end of August 1986, and thus maintain them thereafter.
Cc) allow PCUs and Namboard, with regard to the marketing of
maize and distribution of fertilizers, and within regionally
differentiated price structure, sufficient margins to cover:
(i) not later than May 1985, at least one-third of the
amounts needed to attain full cost recovery;
(ii) not later than May 1986, at least two-thirds of the
amount similarly needed, and;
MiUi) not later than May 1987, the total amount needed to
attain full cost recovery, and thereafter maintain such
amounts;
(d) periodically review and maintain charges for Government
tractor hire services at levels sufficient to attain full
cost recovery.
2. Measures to Improve Marketing Efficiency
A. Before Board Presentation:
(a) finalize the terms of reference of the study on PCU and
Namboard costs, with special reference to maize marketing and
fertilizer distribution, and select consultants to carry out
the study;



- 50 -
.- .Annex 3
Page 2
B. After Project Effectiveness
(a)   within six (6) months following the date of Project
effectiveness: initiate a study with special reference to:
ways and means of improving efficiency of the maize
marketing and fertilizer distribution system through
reducing Cooperatives' and Namboard's costs, with
participation by the private sector acting as an essential
spur to that end; legal changes needed to facilitate
private sector participation in the marketing of maize and
fertilizer distribution; a workable mechanism to guard
against widespread commodity hoarding and/or smuggling by
private traders, and against the bulk of the trade falling
into non-Zambian hands; measures needed to enable Namboard
to establish and manage food grain reserves, and to carry
out the role of a buyer and seller of last resort, policy
and operational guidelines for the management of food grain
reserves, and required investments and financial resources
for the operations of such reserves;
(b)  within twelve (12) months following the date of Project
effectiveness: submit to IDA for review and comments an
interim report of the above study;
Cc)  within eighteen (18) months following the date of Project
effectiveness: submit for IDA rev-iew the final report of
the marketing study proposed above, and agree with IDA
regarding a firm schedule to implement the recommendations
thereof, with special reference to improving the efficiency
of Namboard and PCU, and allowing a broad-based participation
by private traders in the marketing of maize and distribution
of fertilizers, with Namboard playing the role of the buyer
and seller of last resort; and
(d)   within twenty-four (24) months following the date of
Project effectiveness: implement the recommendations of the
study referred to above, in consultation with IDA.
3. Measures to Improve Fertilizer Use Efficiency
(a)   within six (6) months following the date of Project
effectiveness: complete a further study of the factors
underlying the extraordinarily high consumption of
fertilizers, and possible solutions; and present a specific
action plan satisfactory to IDA for implementing the
reconmendation of the study, and
(b)   within twelve (12) months following the date of Project
effectiveness: implement the recommendations of the above
study in accordance with plan of action as may be agreed with
IDA.
