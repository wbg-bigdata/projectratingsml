REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR THE BALI TOURISM PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Indonesia for the
equivalent of US$16 million to help finance the Bali Tourism Project.
About US$9.8 million of the proceeds of the credit would be relent
to the Bali Tourism Development Corporation (BTDC) for 30 years in-
cluding six years of grace with an interest rate of 12% per annum
and about US$800,000 would be relent to PERUMTEL (the national tele-
communicaitions agency) for 20 years including five years of grace at
an intereat rate of 12% per annum,
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report on Indonesia (The Indonesian
Economy: Recent Developments and Prospects for 1974/75, November 26,
1973, R73-273) described and analysed the substantial changes which had
taken place in the Indonesian economy in 1973. Since then there have
been important further developments, especially in oil prices. A Basic
Economic Mission is planned for September/October 1974 to reassess
Indonesia's longer term development prospects and policies.
3.        The Indonesian economy, which was dualistic and export-
oriented in the colonial period, was severely affected by the great
depressiorn in the 'thirties, and the war, followed by the struggle for
independernce, in the 'forties. After a relatively brief period of re-
covery in the early 'fifties, the economy stagnated again in the decade
1957-1967 largely as a result of adverse economic policies. Thus, after
a long period of economic difficulties, in which the population nearly
doubled, lndonesia has become one of the poorest large countries in the
world (1970 population about 115 million, per capita income about $80).
4.        After the Suharto Government introduced an effective stabiliza-
tion program to combat the economic disruption and spiralling inflation
of the mid-1960s, there has been a period of recovery and rehabilitation
under the First Five-Year Plan. Real annual economic growth was close
to 7% in the period 1968-1972. Domestic savings and investments in-
creased considerably, thus providing the basis for continued economic
expansion after the rehabilitation phase.  By 1972, investments, ex-
cluding those in the oil sector, had grown to an estimated 17% of the
GNP, of which more than two-thirds were financed from domestic sources.
In agriculture, sustained efforts were made to increase food production,
with emphasis on rice. Although a drought in the second half of 1972
led to a setback in food production and a steep increase in prices,
production has recovered since then. Efforts to expand food production
continue to receive high priority and in this connection the Government
plans a large increase in fertilizer imports in 1974, international
supplies permitting0 Expansion of domestic fertilizer capacity is being
actively pursued.



- 2 -
5.        Even before the world energy shortage came to a head in the
latter part of 1973, the money economy was booming, and real growth
was probably accelerating under the influence of steep increases in
Indonesia's export prices, a significant physical expansion of produc-
tion in the oil and forestry sectors, a rapid growth in direct foreign
investment (initially in mining, but increasingly in manufacturing),
and a large inflow of short-term credit. The same factors, however,
also caused significant inflation, reaching a rate of 40% per annum in
the beginning of 1974. The Government has taken a number of measures
to combat the inflation, most recently in April 1974.
6.        The contribution of the oil sector to the economy, which was
already increasing rapidly, has taken a quantum jump since September
1973. The Indonesian oil price, which was still $3.73 per barrel in
that month, reached $11.70 per barrel on April 1, 1974. In addition,
Indonesia has renegotiated the contracts with the foreign oil companies
to receive a larger share of the total oil proceeds. Thus, while the
net oil contributions to the balance of payments and the Government's
oil reventies were below $0.5 billion in 1972/731/ (less than 5% of the
GNP), they are expected to reach well over $3 billion in 1974/75, an
int-rease of $20 per capita. Given also the external and domestic in-
flation, total exports as well as budgetary receipts will probably
exceed $5 billion in 1974/75; a rough quadrupling in two years.
7.         The inflation is, however, also affecting the expenditure side
of the balance of payments and the budget. Average Indonesian import prices
are expected to increase by 80 percent between 1972 and 1974t, with the
largest increases occurring in foodstuffs and agricultural inputs (rice,
wheat, sugar, fertilizer). To shield the domestic consumer against the
effect of high external prices, the Government is subsidizing these imports
at an annual cost of nearly $1 billion.  In addition, the Government has to
pay more ior domestic goods and services (including Government salaries).
Thus, about one-half of the additional budgetary receipts will be eroded
by the different effects of inflation.  Of the other half, a significant
part will be spent on real increases in Government outlays, including
much-needed gradual salary increases, development expenditures, routine
material expenditures, and subsidies to regions.   Nevertheless, there will
probably remain a budgetary surplus of $0.5 - $1.0 billion in 1974-75.
The expected overall surplus on the balance of payments is somewhat larger,
and foreign exchange reserves may increase from $0.9 billion on March 31,
1974 to about $2 billion (about five months of imports at the then expected
rate) a year later.
8.        These surpluses are not large in relation to Indonesia's needs
for additional current and capital expenditures in nearly every field,
as specified in the Second Five Year Plan (197h/75-1978/79). Moreover,

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Indonesia and the Association, the recommendation of the Committee pro-
vided in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association, and the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit
are being circulated to the Executive Directors separately. The draft
Development Credit Agreement conforms to the normal pattern for credits
for tourism projects.
54.       The special conditions of effectiveness (Section 6.01 and 6.02
Development Credit Agreement) are that:
(i) The subsidiary financing agreement between the Government
and the BTDC and the subsidiary loan agreement between
the Government and PERUMTEL have been concluded and
ratified;
(ii) the Chief of BTDC's Technical Field Unit has been appointed
and taken up his post; and
(iii) the expert in tourism related land development and the
hotel industry has been appointed and taken up his post
with the BTDC.
55.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
56.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credt.

earlier prOlema of absorptive capacity are gradually being overcome.
Thus, even though some of the expenditures budgeted for 1974/75
(consumers' subsidies) should only be temporary, it will probably not
be long before the new resources are fully absorbed.
9.        The Second Five Year Plan also provides significant new
directions in emphasizing the social, regional and equity aspects of
development. It is recognized that, while the Government's initial
economic stabilization and rehabilitation programs, as well as a
number of specific activities, have benefitted large segments of the
population, the benefits of investments in the modern sector - much
of it in or around Jakarta - have not been widely spread. Also, the
continued high level of agricultural prices after the 1972 crop failure
has ultimately benefitted the rural areas, but is severely reducing
the real income of the urban poor. The Governmentts policy to keep the
prices of basic camnodities in cheek through subsidization of imports
is providing relief, but it is the intention to gradually work out and
implement a number of more basic socially oriented policies in the
fields of employment, education, housing, etc.
10.       Di the short and medium run, Indonesia therefore faces the
problems of efficient utilization of additional resources, and of the
implementation of more socially-oriented policies. In this context,
there will be a need for continued international technical assistance
for project implementation and institution building. After the new
resources have been absorbed, Indonesia will also still need finanicial
assistance to finance further programs to alleviate its poverty. There
is therefore a strong case for continued international assistance to
Indonesia, even though the country may generate relatively modest
budgetary and balance of payments surpluses for a limited period. In
all probability, these surpluses will have been absorbed by the time
disbursements from new projects become significant.
11.       The soft average terms of foreign assistance provided in the
context of the Inter-Governmental Group for Indonesia (IGGf), and the
rescheduling of pre-1966 external debt obligations (under the 1970 Paris
Club Agreement with the Western countries and Japan, and parallel
arrangements with several Eastern Eurppean countries) have kept Indonesia's
public debt service ratio relatively low. Service payments on re-
scheduled and subsequently incurred public debt are estimated at $320
million in 1974, will reach a peak of $380 million in 1975, and are pro-
jected to decrease gradually thereafter. Comparing these amounts with
the projected export level of over $5 billion in 1974/75, and given the
fact that Indonesia's external terms of trade will probably remain
favorable, it appears that Indonesia now has the capacity to service
significant additional debt.
120       The changes in Indonesian economic circumstances discussed
above had become apparent by the time of the IOGI pledging meeting in
May 1974. Aks a result, it was generally agreed that program aid was
no longer necessary on economic grounds, although some donors will



continue such aid, at least for some time, for reasons of convenience.
At the same time, the meeting endorsed the view that a considerable
expansion in project aid was warranted to assist Indonesia in carrying
out a more ambitious development strategy. Although some members were
not in a position to make pledges it seems likely that total aid
conmmitments (including IBRD loans5 in 1974/75 will exceed the aid re-
quest of $850 million.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
13.       For the reasons indicated in Part I, Indonesia will continue
to need substanti3l external financial and technical assistance to re-
habilitate and improve infrastructure and expand production capabilities
in agriculture, minerals, forestry and manufacturing. With the conl-
tinued growth of the economy, the Government will also be able to devote
increasing attention to development of effective programs designed to
ensure that the benefits of development are distributed widely.
Agricultural programs to increase the productivity of smallholder
farmers, regional development in the outer islands, family planning and
other social programs will therefore have an important place in the
development strategy during the period of the Second Plan.
14.       The work of both the headquarters and Resident Staff has been
oriented toward these development objectives. The basic economic
mission, scheduled for early this fall, will concentrate on questions
of employment and income distribution.
15.       All Bank Group lending so far has been on IDA terms.   As a
result of Indonesia's rapidly improving balance of payments and re-
source position, described in Part I of this report, Indonesia is now
able to borrow on less concessional terms. The Bank has therefore in-
formed the Government that all lending after FY74 will be provided on
Bpnk terms. In addition to the Indonesian projects being presented to
the Executive Directors at the same time as this project, one IDA
credit is expected to be presented to the Executive Directors during
the next month.
16.       The Bank Group has in the past financed local currency costs
under its projects in Indonesia. Such financing will continue to be
necessary if the Bank Group is tc increase assistance to the agriculture
and social sectors, where projects frequently have a low foreign ex-
change component. In such cases, the Bank Group will therefore con-
tinue to provide limited amounts of local cost financing.
17.       As of April 30, 1974, Indonesia has received 34 IDA credits
aTounting to US$509.3 million. The Bank Group accounts for less than
4% of Indonesia's total outstanding public debt. By 1978 it is ex-
pected to account for less than 11% of total outstanding debt and less
than 5% of Indonesia's annual debt service obligations. Annex II con-
tains a summary statement of IDA credits and IFC investments as of
April 30, 1974, and notes on the execution of on-going IDA projects.



-5-
18.       In accordance with the priorities of Indonesia's Five-Year
Plans, over 35% of IDA lending to date has been for agriculture. The
Association has extended four credits to help rehabilitate and develop
plantations in the Government estates sector. Other credits for agri-
culture include four to assist rehabilitation of irrigation systems
and one each for a fisheries project, a seeds multiplication program,
beef cattle development, smallholder rubber development, sugar industry
rehabilitation and smallholder tea development. Industry is of growing
importance to the Indonesian economr and the Association has assisted
in four projects in this sector. It organized a consortium of lenders
to finance a major expansion of the PUSRI Fertilizer plant, assistecd in
the reorganization and financing of the major state development bank
(BAPINDO), provided financial assistance for Indonesiats first industrial
estate project, and assisted in the establishment and financing of the
Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia (PDFCI). Other priority
sectors to which credits have been extended are power, transportation,
telecommunications, education and population. In addition, four tech-
nical assistance credits have been made to assist the Governzent in
preparing projects and formulating appropriate development policies.
A fifth irrigation project is expected to be presented to the Executive
Directors soon and projects in rural works, teleconmunications, water
supply and urban development are under preparation.
19.       The first IDA credit to Indonesia was made in 1968, and about
half of all credits have been made since June 1971. The program has
increased rapidly from a relatively small base, and consequently the
undisbursed portion of IDA credits is relatively large. Virtually
every credit has been associated with extensive institutional reforms
involving, inter alia, the creation of new project authorities, draft-
ing of new charters and the enactment of new legislation, all of which
has taken much time. A number of projects have experienced delays,
particularly in the initial stages of implementation. However, project
execution has improved sharply during the last year as organizational
improvements have begun to take effect and Indonesian staff have become
more familiar with Bank Group procedures. Given the status of projects
at the beginning of calendar 1973, disbursements under Indonesian pro-
jects during 1973 were about the same as would have been expected on an
IDA-wide basis for a program of the same size and composition. There
are, nevertheless, still several projects, including the first agri-
cultural estate project and the smallholder rubber project, which
continue to suffer from management weakness and to require continued
close attention from the Bank's Resident Staff.



PART III - THE TOURISM SECTOR
Tourism in Indonesia
20.       Indonesia's lush tropical scenery and rich cultural heritage
offer a uide variety of attractions to the international traveller.
However, the development of tourism in Indonesia is quite recent as the
number of new arrivals has expanded from only about 26,400 in 1967 to
about 300,000 in 1973. This rapid growth in the number of visitors
during the last seven years of more than 50% per annum is a result both
of the increased business traffic generated by expanded economic
activity and a growing number of vacation visitors. About 22% of
foreign visitors are from Western Eurpoean countries, 20% from the
United States, 11% from Japan, 10% from Australia and most of the bal-
ance from the neighboring countries of Malaysia and Singapore. The
contribution of tourism to Indonesia's foreign exchange earnings is
still relatively smll. In 1973, gross foreign exchange earned from
tourism amounted to an estimated US$50 million and net foreign exchange
earnings to about US$37 million (5% and 3% respectively of non-oil exports).
21o       The Government first began promoting travel to Indonesia in
1967 and since then has actively supported the growth of tourism. In
1967, a national advisory board was created to assist in the formulation
of national tourism policies, and a Directorate General of Tourism was
established in 1969 in the Ministry of Communications to implement tour-
ism policies. The Government also provides incentives designed to
attract private hotel investors, including exemptions from import duties
and a five-year corporate income tax holiday for projects in high
priority -reas. The Government has also supported a number of tourist-
related technical assistance projects including the UNDP-financed Bali
Master Plan, which provides the basis of the proposed project, and a
UNNDP-financed study of the long-term prospects for tourism in Indonesia.
Indonesia also hosted the Pacific Area Travel Association (PATA) con-
ference in March/April 1974, which should help the country's tourist
marketing efforts.
22.       The lack of suitable hotel accommodation has been the main con-
straint on the growth of tourism; the number of hotel rooms of inter-
national 3tandard has until recently been limited to less than 3,000 in
Jakarta, 450 in Bali and 100 in Jogjakarta. By late 1973, the situation
began to ease somewhat as a result of the increase in hotel capacity,
which has been underway since 1972 in preparation for the PATA confer-
ence. As a result of this expansion program, the number of rooms of
international standard in Jakarta, Bali and Jogjakarta is expected to
double by mid-1974.
23.       The hotel induStry provides direct employment to about 8,000
people. Both the Swiss Government and the UNDP/ILO are providing techni-
cal support for GoverrLment hotel training programs, but only the re-
cently inaugurated Swiss-supported National Hotel Institute at Bandung
has suitable quarters, equipment and full-time staff. The other public
and private hotel training schools which have developed in recent years
in Jakarta and Bali are poorly equipped and are staffed by inadequately



- 7 -
trained, part-time teachers. Improvement in training is needed to
allow Indonesians to participate more effectively in the opportunities
provided by a growing tourist industry.
Tourism in Bali
24.       Bali's more than two million people are principally engaged in
agriculture. The principal crop is rice, grown under irrigation, followed
by such dry season crops as corn, potatoes and peanuts. There are also
coconut and coffee plantations and some smallscale livestock production
and fishing. The population density of Bali is among the highest in the
world (377 persons/kIn) and the scope for additional agricultural produc-
tion and eMployment is limited by the severe pressure of population on
the land. Industry is still at relatively early stages of development
and tourism therefore represents a principal means of expanding productive
activity and employment in the future.
25.       Bali's main tourist assets are the cultural and scenic attrac-
tions of the island.  Balinese society, based on an ancient Hindu herit-
age and a traditional social structure, has a rich cultural tradition
which is reflected in the profuse artistic expression and the colorful
religious ceremonies of the local people. The natural tropical setting
is varied with rugged volcanic mountains, lush rice terraces and sand
beaches. Bali thus affords the foreign visitor a unique opportunity to
relax in a beautiful tropical environment and to enjoy the cultural
opportunities offered by the Balinese dances, music, festivals and
religious ceremonies, ancient tenples, sculpture and art.
26.       With the construction of the Tuban airport near Deipasar in
1967 and its upgrading in 1971 to handle jet aircraft, Bali has become
much more accessible to foreign visitors and the number of arrivals has
been increasing at an average rate of 27% per annum over the last four
years, reaching a level of nearly 100,000 in 1973. The lack of adequate
first class hotel accommodation has been the major constraint on the
growth of tourism in Bali. Hotels have frequently been overbooked and
it has been very difficult to make advance "block"t reservations which are
essential for group tours. With the completion and expansion of several
hotels now under construction, the number of first clss rooms should
increase from 450 in 1972 to about 1,000 in 1974, but additional hotel
rooms wilL be necessary if accormodation is to expand sufficiently to
meet potential tourist demand. Major hotels are concentrated along the
beach areas at Sanur and Kuta-east and south-west of Denpasar, the pro-
vincial capital and main business center. Until recently, there has been
no central planning of tourist development in Bali and tourism has ex-
panded with little regard for the natural and human environment. In
the absence of effective zoning and building controls, the Sanur and
Kuta areas are becoming over-crowded; individual hotels have varying
standards of construction and design and facilities for water supply and
sewage are generally inadequate. Insufficient attention has been given
to the improvement of the infrastructure needed to support a growing
tourist industry. At present, all traffic between the airport and the
expanding hotel zone in Sanur passes through Denpasar, adding to the
considerable congestion in the town. Also, tourist traffic from the



resorts in Southern Bali to the most attractive scenic and cultural
attractions north of Denpasar must pass through the city and then
travel over a deteriorating network of roads and bridges which have
become inadequate and unsafe with the increase in tourist and commer-
cial tralfic. If allowed to continue, the lack of effective planning
and controls could contribute to a substantial deterioration in the
environment and jeopardize not only future tourist development, but
also the quality of life of the Balinese population.
27.       With a view towards improving this unsatisfactory situation,
the Government engaged consultants (SCETO) to carry out a UNDP-financed
stucdy, for which the Bank Group served as Executing Agency. The consul-
tants prepared a tourismi master plan for Bali which recommended that
future tourist development be concentrated at Nusa Dua, located on the
dry, sparsely populated Bukit peninsula at the southern tip of Bali.
This land has few alternative productive uses, but is very attractive
for tourism, as it has white sand beaches fringed with palm trees, a
pleasant climate and a favorable location within 8 km of the Tuban
airport. The Government accepted the recommendation of its consultants
and requested the Bank Group to help prepare and finance a tourism pro-
ject in accordance with the guidelines provided by the master plan.
28.       The Government also recently established a Bali Tourism
Development Board (BTDB), which is responsible for advising the provin-
cial government on the implementation of the tourism master plan and
coordinating the tourism activities of other government agencies, pri-
vate hotel enterprises and local Balinese community organizations. The
Governor of Bali is Chairman of the BTDB and the relevant government
agencies are represented on the Board. A permanent secretariat to the
BTDB has recently been established which would have sufficient staff
to plan and coordinate tourist activities.  Cn the basis of the tourism
master plan, the provincial government has prepared zoning regulations
which are expected to be enacted by decree of the Governor this year.
The proposed project would provide BTDB with the services of a planning
expert, who would advise on the effective implementation of zoning and
building regulations, and the services of an advisor familiar with the
socio-cultural environment of Bali and the impact of tourism, who would
advise on the means to maximize the participation of the Balinese in the
tourist industry and the benefits which they derive from its development0
With this assistance, the BTDB would be able to plan and regulate more
effectively the future development of tourism in Bali.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
29.       After completion in June 1971 ofthe UNDP-financed Bali tourism
masterplan and feasibility study of development of Nusa Dua, Japanese
consultants (Pacific Consultants), financed under the Third IDA Technical
Assistance credit (275-IND), conducted additional detailed site develop-
ment studies during 1972 and 1973. The project was appraised in June/
July 1973 and negotiations were held in Washington in April 1974. The
Government's negotiating team was led by Mr. Prajogo, Director Gene-ral
of Tourism. An appraisal report has been circulated to the Executive
Directors separately and a credit and project summary is contained in
Annex III.
Project Description
30.       The project consists of supporting infrastructure and facili-
ties for the Nusa Dua estate, which will accommodate about 2,500 hotel
rooms; a Denpasar by-pass road, an estate access road and inprovement of
Pleven roads in Central Bali; a hotel training school; a 10 ha demonstra-
tion farm; and technical assistance to the Bali Tourism Development
Corporation (the Nusa Dua estate corporation referred to hereafter as
BTDC), the BTDB and the provincial Department of Agriculture.
31.       A central amenity core and service center of the estate would
consist of an information center, performance center, offices, fire and
police stations, a bank and shops. The area would be landscaped from a
project nursery with water provided from a separate irrigation scheme
using untreated water from nearby wells. Hotels would be constructed
by private investors on the estate in accordance with strict zoning stan-
dards designed to ensure that hotel construction is of high quality and
compatible with the local environment. The height of all hotels would
be limited to a maximum of 15 meters, approximately the height of the
surrounding palm trees.  Basic infrastructure, consisting of road paving,
street lights, public water supply, sanitary and first aid facilities,
would also be provided for the two villages of Benoa and Bualu adjacent
to the Nusa Dua estate.
32.       Under the project, an eight Im, two-lane access road would be
constructed from Tuban airport to the Nusa Dua estate. Within the re-
sort area, an 11 km secondary road and street network would be construct-
ed in order to facilitate access to common facilities and hotel sites.
Water would be supplied from a new well field development nearby on the
Bukit Penninsula and a treatment plant, storage tank and distribution
system would be provided. Sewage would be discharged into oxidation
ponds constructed on the shoreline of the inland boy between the resort
area and the village of Benoa. The solid waste disposal system would
provide for the collection, transportation and disposal of solid wastes
in sanitary landfill in an isolated area on the shore between the estate
and the airport. The electrical installation provided under the project
would consist of a 20 KV transformer station and a standby generator for
BTDC and of street lighting for roads, streets and public areas within
the resort area. The extension of the existing power system required



- 10 -
to bring power to Nusa Dua from Denpasar, consisting of a 5 MW extension
to the 30 MW generating plant near Denpasar, a 70 KV transmission line,
switching substations and an underground distribution network on the
estate, would be undertaken separately by PLN. Financial assistance has
been requested from the United Kingdom for the extension of the power
system. A new telephone exchange capacity of 600 lines would be erected
in the resort area and would be linked to the existing telephone ex-
change at Denpasar. In addition, 10 telex extensions would be provided.
33.       Outside of the estate, a two-lane road from Tuban Airport to
the town of Tohpati, by-passing Denpasar, would be constructed to permit
visitors from Nusa Dua, Sanur and Kuta to visit major cultural attrac-
tions north of Denpasar without passing through the city. This would
greatly ease the growing traffic congestion in Denpasar. The project
would also rehabilitate and upgrade eleven roads north of Denpasar
totalling about 200 km. These improvements in road surfaces and align-
ments and bridge construction would ensure better access to tourism
sites, reduce significant traffic hazards and facilitate transport of
agriculture production in major rice producing areas.
34.       The project includes the construction and equipping of a train-
ing school to be operated by the BTDC. ILO experts, financed under the
U1WP vocational project for hotel and tourism personnel, are assisting
the Government in finalizing plans including curricula, staffing, criteria
for student selection and a schedule of accommodation and equipment for
the school. Initially, the new training center would provide vocational
skills to 250-300 basic-level trainees per year and about 100 medium
level trainees.
35.       To help local farmers grow food products suitable for inter-
nationally oriented hotels and restaurants and reduce reliance on im-
ported commodities, the project would provide for a 10 ha demonstration
farm. With the help of an internationally recruited agricultural expert,
the farm would demonstrate the production of vegetables and vegetable
grading, produce quality seed for dissemination to local farmers and
help the farmers in contract negotiations with hotels and restaurants.
The project would also include technical assistance for improving poultry
and egg production, and a small amount of agricultural credit from Benk
Rakyat Indonesia.
Organization
36.        The BTDC, a newly established limited liability company in
which the Indonesian Government is the sole shareholder, would be res-
ponsible for supervising the construction and for operating the Nusa Dua
estate. Overall supervision of the company would be provided by a Board
of Supervisors (Dewan Komisaris) consisting of representatives of the
main Government Departments concerned, and chaired by the Director-General
of Tourism. Management of the estate would be the responsibility of a
Board of Directors (Dewan Direksi)O The Board would be headed by a
President Director, who would be assisted by a Director of Technical
Operations and a Director of Finance. A field unit would be established
under the Director of Technical Operations, which would be headed by a
Chief Engineer who would have responsibility for technical aspects of con-
struction. Qualified senior officials have been appointed to these



boards and any future changes in the President Director, Technical
Director, Financial Director, and Chief of the field unit would be made
after consultation with the Association. As tourism estate management
is a new activity in Indonesia, BTDC would require the assistance of
internationallv recruited advisors during the early years of the pro-
Ject. The President Director would be assisted by a tourist expert to
advise on tourism estate management and lease policies and uy a finan-
cial expert to advise on general financial policies and to assist in the
analysis of investment proposals of hotels and other commercial devel-
opers. An engineering expert would advise the Director of Technical
Operations on the technical aspects of construction of the estate.
These advisors would also be responsible for training Indonesian staff
so that they can operate the estate in later years without reliance on
outside technical assistance.
37.       Arrangements would also be made with the relevant Government
agencies for carrying out several components of the project. Under these
arrangements, the Ministry of Public Works would be responsible for the
construction of roads outside the estate; the national telecommunica-
tions agency (PERUMTEL) for the telecommunication component; the national
power company (PLN) for the power distribution system to the estate; and
thp DeparTment of Agriculture for the agriculture component. (See
Section 3.01 of the Development Credit Agreement). The BTDC would be
responsible for arranging for the construction of other project compo- .
nents by private contractors.
Project Cost and Financing
38.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$36.1 million.
The proposed IDA credit of US$16.0 million would finance about 88% of
the foreign exchange component and about 44% of total project cost.
The credit would finance retroactively about US$350,000 of costs in-
curred since July, 1973 for on-site water investigation studies, final
engineering design and technical assistance provided to BTDC. Cost
estimates include price contingencies of about 31% and physical con-
tingencies of about 11% of total baseline costs.
39.       About US$s.8 million of the IDA credit would be relent by the
Government to BTDC under the terms of a subsidiary financing agreeinent,
satisfactory to the Association, at an interest rate of 12% per annum
and with a repayment term of 30 years and payment of principal and
accrued interest to commence after six years of grace. About US$800,000
of the IDA credit for the telecommunications component would be relent to
PERUMTEL under the terms of a subsidiary loan agreement, acceptable to
the Association, at an interest rate of 12% per annum and with a repay-
ment term of 20 years including a five-year grace period. The Government
would bear the foreign exchange risk under these relending operations.
The Government would make available as budgetary allocations about
US$5.1 million of the IDA credit to the Ministry of Public Works for the
roads outside the estate, and about US$300,000 for technical assistance
to the Bali Provincial Government. The Government would make an equity
subscription in BTDC sufficient to cover the balance of the cost of
components of the project carried out by the BTDC, including any cost
overruns. The Government would finance the balance of the costs of
other components of the project from budgetary allocations.

Procurement and Disbursement
40.       Major equipment and civil works contracts would be awarded on
the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
Group guidelines. With respect to contracts for the eleven roads to be
improved north of Denpasar, contracts would be tendered either individu-
ally or combined into bidding groups, at the bidder's option, in order to
permit local contractors to tender for works of a size within their
capabilities and to attract foreign bidders. Contracts for small civil
works of less than US$100,000 for the construction of some buildings, the
preparation of the solid waste disposal site, and the improvement of the
villages of Bualu and Benoa would be awarded after local competitive
bidding. These small and scattered contracts, which would be unsuitable
for international competitive bidding, are not expected to exceed a total
amount of US$500,000. Furniture contracts (totaling US$250,000) would
also be awarded after local competitive bidding, as the contracts would
be small and local firms produce low cost furniture of adequate quality.
Telecommunications equipment procured under the project (US$500,000)
would have to be compatible with that presently used in Bali, and it is
proposed that PERUMTEL negotiate this purchase with manufacturers of
this equipment.
41.        For purposes of bid comparison where international competitive
bidding is required, qualified local manufacturers would receive a pre-
ference of 15% or the level of custom duties, whichever is less. For
civil works contracts, local contractors would receive a preference of
7 1/2%.
42.       The IDA credit would be disbursed for 100% of the CIF cost of
directly imported equipment, 95% of the ex-factory cost of locally pro-
duced equipment, and 70% of the cost of off-the-shelf items. It would
also be disbursed to meet 50% of the cost of civil works and 100% of the
foreign exchange costs of professional services and technical assistance.
Market Denmnd
43.        WTile the prospects for future growth of tourism traffic to
Southeast Asia are somewhat uncertain due to the potential impact of the
energy crisis on air fares, exchange rates and economic growth in tourism
generating countries, there are several factors which indicate that
tourist traffic to Bali is likely to continue to increase. Bali pre-
sently accounts for only 5% of total tourist traffic visiting the major
Southeast Asian tourist areas.  The arowth in the number of group tours
to Bpli has primarily been constrained by the lack of adequate hotel
accommodations. Once additional hotels have been constructed, Bali will
be included in an increasing number of group tours, because the island
will complement rather than compete with other tourist destinations in
the region. Secondly, the number of Australians and other vacationists
from neighbouring countries has been growing rapidly in recent years
and the increasing availability of special air fare rates under Group
Inclusive Tour sales and charter flights should contribute to an expan-
sion in the flow of such tourists. Thirdly, the number of business
travellers to Indonesia, mainly Jakarta, is likely to continue to in-
crease with the continued attractiveness of Indonesia for foreign invest-
ment and the growing importance of its oil and gas resources. Many
business visitors are likely to spend a few extra days in Bali during
their visit.



- 13 -
4h.       After taking into account the potential impact of the energy
crisis, the appraisal report estimates that the number of foreign visitors
to Bali will increase from 100,000 in 1973 to 287,000 in 1978 and to
540,000 in 1983, when all 2,500 hotel rooms in Nusa Dua will have been
completed. This estimate is based on the conservative assumption that
the annual growth in tourist traffic to Bali during this period will be
19%, as compared with 27% per year during the 1969-73 period when arrivals
were constrained by the lack of suitable accommodation.
45.       An additional factor which could affect the rate of touriSt
development on Bali is the Governmentts air access policy. In connection
with its bi-lateral air negotiations, the Government is seeking a sub-
stantial share of the air traffic to Bali for the national airline,
Garuda. As part of this effort, the Government has informed foreign
airlines serving Bali that they will not be permitted to use Bali as a
terminating point in Indonesia and that all flights terminating in
Indonesia would have to terminate in Jakarta. Airlines serving Bali on
through flights (such as Singapore/Bali/Sydney) and charter flights
would not be affected by these regulations. Government authorities are
currently reviewing these questions in order to find solutions which
would permit Indonesia to take advantage of its promising tourist market
and to safeguard the interest of the national airline.
4,J.      In order to ensure the priority development of the Nusa Dua
Estate and to avoid the possibility of over-building in Bali, the Government
has limited the number of international class hotel rooms outside the Bukit
peninsula to 1,600 and has agreed that until 1985 this limit would not be
raised without the agreement of the Association. (Section 4J05 Development
Credit Agreement). With the construction of the 2,500 rooms at Nusa Dua,
the total number of rooms of international standard in Bali in 1983 will
be about 4,100. These rooms would have high occupancy rates under any of
alternative assumptions made in the appraisal report regarding the future
development of tourist traffic. The strong interest of a number of pri-
vate groups in investing at Nusa Dua provides additional confirmation
that the prospects for tourism development are highly favorable.
Financial Return of the BTDC
47.       BTDC would lease hotel sites to private investors under contracts
which would provide for lease charges based on the gross revenue of hotels
and service charges to cover the expenses of operating and maintaining
common estate facilities. Such charges are expected to be set at a level
which would allow hotel investors to earn a reasonable return on their
investment and allow BTDC to recover the capital and operating costs of
its non-utility assets and to earn an annual rate of return on such assets
at full operation of about 8%. Before entering into lease agreements,
BTDC would furnish to the Association copies of its model lease and lease
sale agreements and a detailed statement of lease policies and would enter
into such agreements only in accordance with lease policies agreed with the
Association. BTDC would also charge hotels for water supply, sewerage and
waste disposal at levels which would allow it to earn an overall rate of
return on gross fixed utility assets of 11% after full development
(Section 4.07 Development Credit Agreement). To safeguard further its
financial position, BTDC would until 1985 not incur any long-term debt
other than that required for the financing of the project without the
prior approval of the Association (Section 4.06 Development Credit Agreement).

Benefits and Justification
48.       The economic rate of return of the total resort area investment
would be 19% over the 25-year economic life of the project. In estimat-
ing the gross benefits from the proposed tourism investment, the appraisal
report takes account of the total expenditures of tourists who stay in the
estate hotels, but not the revenues from international travel accruing to
Indonesian airlines as a result of the project. The relevant costs in-
clude the capital and operating costs of the project facilities as well
as the capital and operating costs of hotels and other superstructure in
the project area. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the project would
be economically Justified after allowing for a range of possible uifavor-
able variations in investment cost, hotel profitability and timing of
construction. Under the assumptions made in the appraisal report, the
rate of return on Indonesia's public and private investment on the
estate (including that financed by IDA) would be 23%. Separate analy-
ses for the Denpasar by-pass road and the multi-purpose roads north of
Denpasar indicate that the economic rates of return of these investments
would be L5 and 20% respectively.
49.       The proposed project is expected to increase Indonesia rs gross
foreign exchange earnings by US$48 million in 1985 when the estate and
hotels are in full operation. After taking into account the import com-
ponent of operating costs (estimated at 40% currently for hotels irn Bali),
de't service on foreign hotel loans and the IDA credit and dividends paid
to foreign investors, the net annual foreign exchange earnings generated
by the project are expected to amount to about US$36 million by 1985.
50.       Assuming a typical ratio of 2.0 employees per room in the
estate hotels and taking into account the additional employment created
in restaurants, shops and other facilities on the estate, the project is
expected to create direct employment for about 6,000 people. If the in-
direct employment generated outside the estate by the increase in tourism
under the project is taken into account, total new jobs created would amount
to nearly 10,000.
51.       In addition to the net revenues generated by the BTDC, the
Indonesian Government is expected to collect annual corporate income
taxes from hotels amounting to US$1.5 million by 1985 and over US$2.0
million by 1990. Municipal governments are expected to receive annual
sales tax receipts from project hotels and restaurants amounting to
about US$2.8 million by 1985.
52.       In addition to these quantifiable benefits, the proposed pro-
ject woulti make a major contribution in directing the development of the
tourist industry in a way which allows for the realization of Bali's con-
siderable potential for tourist development while at the same time minimiz-
ing the possible harmful effects on the local culture. By concentrating
future development at the relatively isolated site of Nusa Dua, tourism
can expand without encroaching on land with alternative uses and with a
minimum effect on the life of most Balinese. Moreover, the concentration
of hotel development in a defined area as opposed to haphazard decisions
of individual investors, would simplify planning and zoning decisions and
reduce the cost of off-site and on-site infrastructure. The proposed
strengthening of the BTDB would also help to ensure effective Government
control of tourism development. Finally, the hotel training school and
the agricultural component should help the local population to partici-
pate in the benefits of a growing tourism industry.

IDA PROJECTS IN EXECUTION _
Cr. No. 12?7 Irrigation Rehabilitation; US$5 Million Credit of
September 6, 1968; Closing Date:  December 31, 1975
This project includes the supply of earth-moving equipment and
machinery to augment hand labor in rehabilitation work on three irrigation
systems (in Java) and the construction of a fourth (in South Sumatra).
All the equipment supplied under the credit is being well utilized and
disbursements are 98% of appraisal timetable. Final completion of the
project is expected to be delayed by about two years in order to complete
much additional needed drainage work, the financing of which was not pro-
vided for under the &redit. These additional costs will be met by the
Government. The revised economic rate of return on the project, which
was calculated at 50% at appraisal, is now expected to be about 25%. The
closing date has been postponed to December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 154  Highways; US$28 Million Credit of June 20, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
The project is now progressing satisfactorily. The closing
date has been postponed by one year to December 31, 197h.
Cr. No. 155 Agricultural Estates; US$16 Million Credit of
June 20, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
This credit is for the rehabilitation of two Government owrLed
estate groups in North Sumatra. The credit became effective six months
after signature, the delay resulting from unforeseen difficulties in the
appointment of management, advisors and visiting inspectors. Delays in
development occurred as oil palm planting material in Indonesia was found
to be genetically unsuited and, an unforeseen sharp fall in rubber prices
seriously restricted the availability of self-generated funds. With recent
improvements in management and much higher international prices for rubber
the financial situation of the PNP V is expected to improve.
Now that field and factory standards have been raised to a good
technical level the management has been advised to concentrate on cost
control in order to prepare for the time when produce prices are less
attractive than they are today. The combined efforts of the management,
consultants and IDA supervision missions are beginning to yield good
results.
Cr. No. 165 Electricity Distribution; US$15 Million Credit of
October 29, 1969; Closing Date:   June 30, 1975
This project is progressing satisfactorily.   The closing date
has been postponed by 18 months to June 30, 1975.
These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 193 PUSRI Fertilizer Expansion; US$35 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970 (as amended May 1973); Closing Date:
December 31, 1975
The project has progressed satisfactorily after a new time
schedule was agreed to allow for time required to meet all conditions of
effectiveness and the procurement requirements of all co-lenders. The
general contractor now is expected to ccmplete the plant by early July 1974
about one-and-one-half months ahead of the revised schedule. The construc-
tion and installation of a natural gas gathering system and a 65 milej trans-
mission line has also been delayed but the plant is now receiving ga's for
testing and the gathering system is expected to be completed two months
ahead of startup.
Cost for the fertilizer plant has increased by about 17% due
to currency revaluations and changes made as detailed design progressed
and the tru,3 composition of the gas became known.  The gas system has
been enlarged to meet the increased need of the fertilizer complex and
to supply a greatly increased usage by Pertamina's refineries and by
power plants.
Latest cost estimates show an increase of about 130% against a
system capacity increase of 104%. Current estimates indicate a foreign
exchange cost over-run of nearly $30 million compared to the appraisal
report estimates. AID, OECF and IDA are contributing $4 million, $3.7
million and $5 maillion respectively to help finance the foreign exchange
cost over-rin.  The Government will cover the balance required to com-
plete the project.
Despite the capital cost increases the project has become more
remunerative. Given the substantially lower capital cost compared to
estimates for simLilar projects presently under consideration, and the
presently expected long-range international prices for Urea, the economic
rate of retuirn, calculated at 14% at the time of appraisal, should now
be in excess of 30%.
Cr. No. 194 Agricultural Estates; US$17 Million Credit of
June 15 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
This project was for the rehabilitation of two Government-owned
estate groups in North Sumatra. The credit became effective eight months
after signature, the delay resulting from unforeseen difficulties in the
appointment of management advisors and visiting inspectors. Delays iz
development occurred as oil palm planting material in Indonesia was
found to be genetically unsuitable, and an unforeseen sharp fall in
rubber prices seriously restricted the availability of self-generated
funds. However, during 1973 a record 3,200 ha of oil palm were
planted on PNP VI and the program will be virtually on target.  The 1973
rubber program was reduced following the advice of the last Supervision
Mission as PNP IV was over-extended; if the high standards of replanting
now being achieved can be maintained, it should be possible to increase
the size of future programs again.



ANNEX II
5 of 10 pages
Mbnagement has improved in the field and factory and reasonable
standards are being maintained. More emphasis is required on cost control
and management has agreed to take the necessary action.   Solid progress is
being achieved and PNP VIts financial situation has been greatly helped by
the present higher producer prices. PNP IV has also made marked progress
during 197;3 and is in a satisfactory financial position.
Cr. No. 195 Irrigation Rehabilitation II; Us$18.5 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Closing Date:_ November 30, 1974
The project includes rehabilitation and drainage works over
186,000 ha. After a slow start, due to problems with preparation of
tender documents and difficulties in obtaining acceptable bids, work is
now proceeding somewhat better. Problems of quality and progress still
exist, but, the consultants are tackling these vigorously, and this
situaation is improving. Estimated costs remain within the overall
appraisal estimate, but the project will be one year behind appraisal
schedule.
Cr. No. 210  Telecommunications; US$12.8 Million Credit of
July 13, 1970; Closing Date:  June 30, 1974
After a slow start, due to procurement difficulties, orders for
all equipment except the tropospheric scatter system have now been placed.
The management consultants have completed their work but have been retained
to implement the recommendations being discussed between the Government
and the Association to work out appropriate measures. The Government is
requesting reallocation of the proceeds of the credit and postponement
of the closing date to complete disbursements.
Cr. No. 211  Fisheries; US$3.5 Million Credit of July 13, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
After a slow start this project is now progressing satisfactorily.
Project management satisfactory to the Association has now been appointed;
contracts with engineering and management consultants have been concluded
and the consultants have begun work and the contract for the shore facilities
has been awarded.
Cr. No. 216 Technical Assistance II; US$4.0 Million Credit of
September 15, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1974
This project is progressing satisfactorily, but it has been
necessary to postpone the closing date by one year to complete disburse-
ments for on-going studies.



ANNEX II

Cr. No. 219  Education; US$4.6 Million Credit of November 6, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The project is about 12 months behind schedule due to delay in
the appointment of the architect but is now progressing satisfactorily.
Four out of five contracts for civil works have been approved by the
Government and the Association, as also have equipment lists. The leader
of the team of overseas specialists has arrived and is assisting the train-
ing of the first group of technical teachers for the centers. While dis-
bursements were initially slower than expected, it is likely that construc-
tion of the five centers will be completed in less time than originally
estimated and the final implementation would thus be on schedule.
Cr. No. 220 Irrigation Rehabilitation II; US$L4-5 Million Credit of
November 6, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
This project covers 202,000 ha and includes rehabilitation and
re-introduction of an 0 & M organization in three irrigation systems, two
in Java and one in South Sulawesi. Construction remains about two years
behind schedule. The problems with preparation of contract documents,
which have caused this delay, have been overcome and, while no further
delays are expected, it is unlikely that the time lost could be regained.
There has been some increase in overall project costs, and a review is
being carried out to determine the effect of the dollar devaluation on
civil works and equipment contracts yet to be awarded. Disbursements are
improving to about 52% of the level estimated at appraisal. Sensitivity
tests run at the time of appraisal showed that a two year delay and 15%
cost overrun would reduce the economic rate of return from 25% to 21%.
Cr. No. 246 Seeds; US$7.5 Million Credit of My 14, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1977
Project implementation is behind schedule due to initial delays
in organization, management and effective procurement. These problems are
being overcome but, because of procurement delays, inflation, currency re-
valuation and design changes in the seed processing plant, a 20% cost in-
crease for the original project proposal became likely. However, recent
studies indicate that the market size for rice seed may be only about half
the original production target. Therefore,the latest Supervision Mission
has recomwmnded reduction of the seed production target from 22,000 tons
to 12,000 tons per annum in 1977, by which time the need for further
development of the seed industry would have been reviewed. The possibility
of such a reduction in project output was foreseen at the time of appraisal
and provided for in the Credit Agreement. Therefore, two subsidiary seed
processing centers will not be constructed and the funds now remaining in
the credit will be adequate to complete the project. The expected economic
benefits of the project remain substantial with a rate of return of 59%,
not including the research and seed certification components whose benefits
are not easily quantifiable.

Closing Date: June 30, 197
rhis credit is for the rehabilitation for two groups of
Government-owned tea estates in West Java. Despite management weaknesses
in cost control and efficiency, progress to date is satisfactory and re-
lationships between management and consultants are good. Recently revised
cost estimates for factory rehabilitation and expansion are substantially
above appraisal estimates and project consultants have been asked to review
them.
Cr. No. 260 Highways II; US$35 Million Credit of June 24, 1971;
Closing Date:  September 30, 1975
'This project is in Sumatra and consists of construction with
supervision of about 200 km. of highway, detailed engineering of further
highway sections and a regional development study. The project is about
six months behind schedule, but the construction contracts have all been
awarded and no further delays are expected.
Cr. No. 275  Technical Assistance III; US$4 Million Credit of
December 29, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Progress on this project is satisfactory, but it has been
necessary to postpone the closing date to complete disbursements for on-
going studies.
Cr. No. 288 Second Education; US$12.5 Million Credit of
March 9, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Project implementation has been slow due to delays in concluding
a contract with consmltant architects and in recruiting technical assistance.
However, the architectural contract has now been signed and the project unit
has decided to recruit technical assistance through a FAO Fund-in-Trust
arrangement. Project implementation is now progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 289 Irrigation Rehabilitation IV; US$12.5 Million Credit of
March 9, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The project is located in East Java and consists of rehabilita-
tion of the irrigation system and the re-establishment of 0 & M in five
non-contiguous areas totalling 229,000 ha, known as Pekalen-Sampean. It
also provides for the employment of consultants to assist in the execution
of Pekalen-3ampean and for feasibility studies of further irrigation re-
habilitation projects. Civil works and equipment purchase for the main
project, Pekalen-Sampean, are just beginning and are on schedule.
Consultants for the various studies are at work with their counterparts.
Groundwater investigations will be delayed due to procurement difficulties.
The rehabilitation and storage feasibility studies are on schedule.
Disbursemeni,s are on schedule.

Cr. No. 300  Population; US$13.2 Million Credit of April 20, 1972
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Progress under the project is currently being hampered by
organizational weakness and delays in obtaining necessary local currency
funds. The procurement of vehicles has also been delayed due to
Government ban on importing fully built-up cars. These matters are
currently being discussed with the Government.
Cr. No. 310 Development Finance; US$10 Million Credit of
June 7, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
This credit is expected to be fully committed by mid-1974.
Disbursements are rising quickly.
Cr. No. 318 Inter-Island Fleet Rehabilitation; US$8.5 Million
Credit of June 25, 1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1976
Progress on this project is satisfactory but the weak financial
position of PELNI, the Government-owned shipping company and main sub-
borrower, has caused concern. An audit of PELNI has been completed and
in consultation with the Association and BAPINDO, the Government is
taking appropriate action to strengthen PELNI's financial position.
Cr. No. 319 Agricultural Estates IV; US$11 Million Credit of
June 26, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
This credit is for the rehabilitation and development of 8,600
ha rubber and 9,400 ha oil palms, including factories, on a group of
Government-owned estates in South Sumatra. After a delay of several
months to allow additional time to appoint inspection services and
executive assistants, this credit became effective on February 1, 1973.
The project has recovered from these initial delays and in now progressing
very satisfactorily. Agricultural standards are inproving rapidly and
procurement planning is well advanced.
Cr. No. 334  Electricity Distribution II; US$40 Million Credit of
September 29, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976

This credit became effective on August 13, 1973 and has suffered
from severe financial and organizational difficulties. The Resident Staff
has been monitoring the project closely and GovernmBnt is considering
actions to overcome present problems and accelerate project implementation.
Cr. No. 387 Education III; US$13.5 Million Credit of
June 1, 1973; Closing _Dte:  December 31, 1981
This credit was declared effective on August 30, 1973. Manu-
script preparation, testing and book production is well advanred. The
development of programs for book distribution and teacher training depend
largely on the timely recruitment of technical assistance. The Government
approached UNESCO for this technical assistance under a contract reimburs-

holder and private estate tea areas and for the rehabilitation of five
privately owned black tea factories and the construction of two new black
tea factories in West and Central Java. This credit became effective on
November 29, 1973.
Cr. No. 4Qq Sugar Project; US$50 Million Credit of
June 2b, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The effectiveness of this credit was delayed because it took
longer than expected for the Government to implement legal and institu-
tion changes to amalgamate existing PNPs into larger PT estate groups
and to establish a joint sugar projects unit to provide overall coordina-
tion. These changes have now been implemented and the credit was de-
clared effective in April 1974. However, the Government engaged the
necessary consultants'services prior to credit effectiveness and work
is proceeding on schedule.
