APPRAISAL OF THE BALI TOURISM PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        This report appraises a project to provide infrastructure for a new
tourism estate to be developed at Nusa Dua on the Bukit Peninsula of the island
of Bali (Map No. 10738). Common facilities and services, including an access
road from the airport, are to be provided for 310 hectares of land which has
been acquired by the Government. Sites are to be leased to private hotel
investors who would eventually construct about 2,500 rooms of internationally
acceptable standard. In addition to the tourism estate, the project includes
improvement of existing roads on the island to serve both tourism and other
needs; a new road by-passing Denpasar, the provincial capital, and providing
direct access from Nusa Dua and the airport to the major existing hotel zones
and areas of major tourist appeal nbrth of the city; training facilities
for hotel personnel; and a small demonstration farm for Vegetable production.
Furthermore, technical assistance would be provided to newly created and
existing Government agencies to help implement the project within a master
plan for tourism development for the whole island. The scope and design of
the project are consistent with the Government's effort to maximize the benefits
from the expansion of the tourism industry while protecting as much as possible
the unique cultural life and scenic attractions of the island which are its
major tourism assets.
ii.       Indonesia attracted relatively little foreign tourism until 1967.
During the subsequent period of stability and rapid economic growth, the num-
ber of foreign visitor arrivals grew at an average annual rate of over 507,,
to reach an estimated 300,000 in 1973. An even more rapid increase might have
occurred but for the severe lack of suitable hotel accommodations particularly
in Bali. Foreign visitor arrivals in the island grew at an annual rate only
half that for the country as a whole during 1969-73. Though ideally suited
to complement rather than compete with other destinations for multiple-stop
group tours, Bali, despite its unique appeal to international travellers,
presently receives only 5% of the tour traffic to Southeast Asia. Similarly,
its potential as a single destination for tourists from neighboring countries,
and for weekend excursions by business travellers to Indonesia, has hardly
begun to be tapped.
iii.      Bali is thus in a relatively good position to develop its tourism
industry as a means of improving the economic base for its population of a
little over 2 million people. Unemployment and underemployment are already
evident, particularly among the better educated youth. They cannot find
adequate scope for their talents within traditional activities such as agri-
culture, and the growth potential of other non-traditional sectors is limited.
iv.       Prospects for a continuing rapid growth of tourist traffic to
Southeast Asia are clouded by the potential impact of the energy crisis on
air fares, exchange rates and economic growth in the major tourist generating
countries. However, several special factors operate in favor of an expansion
of tourist travel to Bali: the existence of hitherto repressed demand because
of the scarcity of hotel accommodation; the strategic location of Bali as a



- ii -
complementary rather than competing destination in Southeast Asia; and tile
strong appeal of Bali to market segments not likely to be affected adversely
by the energy crisis, such as business travelers to Indonesia and tourists
from neighboring countries. Foreign tourists visiting Bali are projected to
increase from an estimated 95,000 in 1973 to 287,000 by 1978, when the first
hotels in Nusa Dua are expected to open, and 540,000 by 1983 when 2,500 hotel
rooms should be available in Nusa Dua. This assumes an average growth rate
of 26% in tourist traffic to Bali for the period 1973-77 and 14% for the
subsequent six years when previously repressed demand will have been met.
Less favorable assumptions concerning the impact of the energy crisis would
still lead to projections of tourist traffic sufficient to support the expec-
tation of a gradual, if somewhat differently phased, build uip of hotels at
Nusa Dua to a total of 2,500 rooms by 1985 at the latest, with acceptable
economic returns.
v.        The proposed tourism project at Nusa Dua is consistent with thie
recommendations of the UNDP financed Bali tourism master plan prepared by
French consultants in 1971 and accepted by the Government. This plan
emphasizes the need to concentrate future hotel development in an area where
the potentially negative effects of tourism on Bali's traditional life can be
minimized. In the past, hotel development in Bali has taken place with little
regard for the natural and human-i environment. The development of infrastruc-
ture has been neglected, a fact most evident in the deteriorating condition
of roads and bridges, which are inadequate to serve the growing traffic.
Recognizing the dangers, the Government has imposed zoning regulations,
height limitations and building standards. To help assure priority develop-
ment in Nusa Dua, the Government in 1972, after consultation with the Bank
Group, limited to 1,600 the numbier of internationally acceptable hotel rooms
outside Nusa Dua. This level will be reached within the next few years.
The Government will maintain this limit until 1985, subject to periodic re-
view by the Association.
vi.       A newly created Bali Tourism Development Board (BTDB) would be
responsible for implementing the tourisn. master plan wwhich calls for coordi-
nation of several Government agencies, private tourist and hotel enterprises,
and Balinese community organizations. Technical assistance would be provided
under the project to help the BTDB and other Government agencies formulate
and implement appropriate policies designed to assure that potential negative
effects of tourism on Bali's social and cultural life are minimized, that the
best possible use is made of the existing human and natural assets, and that
the benefits of tourism are distributed in a more equitable manner to the
Balinesa population.
vii.      The implementation of the Dhysical components of the project would
be largely the responsibility of a newly created, Government-owned tourism
estate corporation, the Bali Tourism Development Corporation (BTDC). The
infrastructure works and common facilities of the tourism estate would
comprise water supply, sewerage and waste disposal systems; electrical in-
stallations; telecommunication facilities; internal streets and stormwater
drainage; landscaping and landscape irrigation; an amenity core; and a ser-
vice center. The development of the tourism estate would also make it pos-
sible to carry out some infrastructure improvements in two adjacent villages.
These would consist of paving of roads, streetlighting, public water supply
and sanitation and first aid facilities.



- iii -
viii.     To alleviate potential traffic problems, the project provides for
construction of a two-lane road from the airport to the existing hotel zones
and areas of major tourist appeal north of Denpasar, as well as an access road
from che airport to Nusa Dua. In addition, deficiencies in the existing road
network in these areas would be eliminated through upgrading of road surfaces
and drainage, and through replacement of inadequate and unsafe bridges.
ix.       The project includes the construction of a training center to be
operated by BTDC which would annually provide instruction in basic and medium
level vocational skills for about 300 to 400 trainees. A small demonstration
farm, to be operated by the Ministry of Agriculture, would also be established
to help local farmers grow vegetables suitable for internationally-oriented
hotels and restaurants. Additional technical assistance to be provided under
the project would be directed towards improvement in the production and
marketing of other food items.
x.        The project is estimated to cost US$36.1 million equivalent, of
which US$18.1 million equivalent is expected to be in foreign exchange. It
is proposed that the Association provide a credit of US$16.0 million, cover-
iTg 88% of the foreign exchange component or slightly more than 447% of the
project cost. This would include an amount of US$0.35 million for retro-
active financing of wqater investigation, well-drilling and technical assist-
ance to the BTDC. The balance of the funds required to finance the project
and any cost overruns would be covered by budgetary contributions from the
Government.
xi.       Major civil works and equipment contracts would be awarded under
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines.
Contracts for the improvement of eleven multi-purpose roads would be tendered
either individually or combined into bidding groups, at the bidder's option,
in order to permit local contractors to tender for works of a size within
their capabilities and to attract foreign bidders. Only local competitive
bidding would be required for small civil works contracts, each of less than
US$100,000, which could not appropriately be grouped. The total amount of
such contracts would amount to about US$0.5 million. In evaluating interna-
tional tenders for civil works, a 7.5% margin of preference would be allowed
local contractors; for bids on equipment, local manufacturers would be allowed
a 15% margin of preference, or the prevailing level of customs duties, whichever
is lower. Telecommunications equipmen, involving items amounting to about
US$150,000 equivalent would have to be compatible with existing installations.
I-t is therefore proposed that Perumtel, the government agency responsible for
this part of the project, negotiate their purchase with manufacturers of these
items.
xii.      The new tourism estate is expected to attract private investors
prepared to build hotels and other tourism facilities in Nusa Dua. Strong
indications of interest have been received from Indonesian and foreign groups
of investors, some of whom have already tentatively chosen specific sites
'within the tourism estate.  When fully operational in 1983 the project would
provide direct employment for about 5,800-6,000 workers in the hotels and
other tourism establishments.  An additional 3,700 jobs would be generated
for artists and handicraft workers. The economic rate of return is estimated
at 18.7%. Net foreign exchange earnings are estimated to amount to US$8.5
million in 1978 and US$36.2 million annually from 1985 onwards. This may be
compared with the estimated foreign exchange component of the infrastructure



- iv -
project of US$18.1 million and the estimated foreign exchange component of
the hotels to be built at Nusa Dua of about US$25.0 million. In addition to
the net income generated by the Governnent-owned BTDC, the Indonesian central
government is expected to receive abown: US$1.5 million equivalent a year in
corporate income tax payments from the hotels, and municipal governments in
Bali are expected to collect about US$2.8 million equivalent a year in sales
taxes by 1985.
xiii.     To help ensure its financial viability, BTDC would adhere to sound
financial principles in the operation of its facilities, including the water
supply, sewerage and waste disposal systems, the other non-utility facilities
and the training center. BTIC would be able to achieve reasonable financial
rates of return on its investments by charging the hotels and other benefi-
ciaries adequate lease rents and user charges for the services provided.
xiv.      The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$16.0 milLion
equivalent.



IINDONESIA
APPRAISAL OF THE BALI TOURISM PROJECT
1. ITWRODUCTION
1.01      In 1968 the Indonesian Government requested Bank Group assistance
for tourism development. A project identification mission visited Indonesia
in March 1969 anid recommended the preparation of a tourism master plan for
Bali and related feasibility studies for a first-phase development. Subse-
quently a UNDP financed study, with the Bank as executing agency, was com-
pleted by French consultants in June 1971. The Government endorsed the
consultants' master plan, including the recommendation that further tourism
development be concentrated at Nusa Dua, a site on the Bukit Peninsula. The
project feasibility studies, however, were not adequate, and additional
studies were carried out by Japanese consultants during 1972 and 1973, fi-
nanced in part by the third IDA Technical Assistance Credit to Indonesia.
Infrastructure components outside of Nusa Dua were prepared by individual
ministries and independent agencies with the help of consultants. Except for
water supply, these studies were completed in time for the appraisal mission
in June 1973.
1.02      In accord with the master plan, the project would provide infrastruc-
ture in support of tourism development at Nusa Dua including water, sewerage,
cdrainage, roads, telecommunications and power installations. The project also
includes facilities for hotel training, a small demonstration farm, road im-
provements outside Nusa Dua to serve both tourism and other economic needs and
technical assistance in impleiaenting both the project and the master plan.
1.03      This is the first project of its kind in Indonesia and, due to its
complexity, a considerable amount of time and effort was required for prepara-
tion and appraisal. The appraisal mission completed its field work in July
1973. The Resident Staff assisted the mission on aspects relating to air-
policy,the demonstration farm and road engineering. The Public Utilities
'Division, Asia Region, advised on water supply, sewerage and waste disposal
components. Mr. R. Noronha, consultant anthropologist, evaluated the poten-
tial social impact of the project. In December 1973, following completion of
first phase grotnd water studies, a second mission visited Indonesia to
update the appraisal.
1.04      This would be the first IDA credit for tourism in Indonesia.
2. THE ECONOMY AND THE TOURISM SECTOR
A. TRE ECONOMY
2.01      There has been a remarkable recovery in the Indonesian economy since
the mid 1960's. Gross domestic product increased on average by over 7% per
annum over the last five years. Following a period of stability from 1969-
71, prices have increased significantly since late 1972, particularly for;
food products such as rice. Agricultural output has increased about 47. per annum



2-
although growth was considerably less in 1972 due ,o drought conditions.
Industrial production, particula::ly of textiles, has grown. substantially.
Rehabilitation and expansion of domestic enterprises, backed by continued
private investment and commitments of official aid for major industrial
projects, points to further rapid growth of industry. Infrastructure re-
habilitation and expansion is underway, financed in large measure by project
aid, including IDA credits. Deficiencies in the transport, power and tele-
communications sectors could, however, become a constraint on agriculture,
industry and other sectors, such as tourism, unless ongoing and future
projects are accelerated.
2.02      The balance of payments situation has changed dramatically since
1971, due to internal factors (rice shortages and increased investment
activities) and to external factors (exchange rate fluctuations and sharp
increases in the price of oil and other commodities). While imports have
grown quite rapidly, exports have increased even faster and, combined with
an inflow of private capital, havre allowed a significan.t improvement in net
foreign exchange reserves. The contribution of petroleum to the Indonesian
economy, particularly the balance oif payments, is now taking a quantum jump
froia $0.8 billion in net foreign exchange receipts in 1973 to over $3 billion
estimated for 1974. For this and' otier reasons, the import constraint on
growth will be largely removed during the Second Plan period (1974-,'8).
2.03      The problemnsfacing Indonesia, however, are still considerable.  Its
population, fifth largest in the world, is growing at a rate of 2.4% per year.
Per capita income is low, and unemployment is high. About half of GDP and
80% of employment is generated by, agriculture.  If, in the short-term, the
growth in national expenditures can be carefully managed, and a good part of
the additional oil revenues put to productive use, Indonesia could achieve
accelerated economic growth in the Second Plan period. The Second Plan
itself gives greater emphasis to increasing employment, development of the
outer islands, including Bali, and to a reduction in regional imbalances in
income. Tourism development would contribute to these goals.
2.04      The economy of Bali is based on traditional agriculture.  In the
absence of mineral deposits, other economic activity is limited, the most
important being the handicraft industry which satisfies the needs of a tra-
dition-bound society and, increasingly, the demand of foreign visitors. The
population of about 2.2 million is unevenly distributed, reflecting the com-
munity's dependence on agricultural land. With little further expansion of
agricultural land possible, and with existing land increasingly parcelled,
employment problems are likely to worsen, particularly among better educated
youths seeking modern-sector jobs. In these circumstances, tourism has high
developmental priority for the island.
B. THE TOURISM SECTOR
2.05      Despite its remarkable cultural and scenic attractions, Indonesia
received relatively little tourism traffic before 1967. Since then, although
hampered by a scarcity of suitable accommodation, and limited to a few des-
tinations such as Jakarta, Jogjakarta, Bali and Medan, the number of foreign



-3-
arrivals has increased at an average rate of over 507% per year, from 26,400
in 1967 to nearly 300,000 estimated for 1973. This rapid growth, reflecting
both increased business traffic and rapidly expanding vacation demand, was
facilitated by the increase in the number of international airlines serving
Indonesia and the greater frequency of flights. Visitors from the U.S. and
from 11estern Europe account for the largest share of arrivals (20% and 22.,
respectively), while visitors from Japan and Australia have increased most
rapidly in recent years, and together account for another 217/ of arrivals.
The remaining visitors are mainly from neighboring Malaysia and Singapore.
The average length of stay is estimated at five nights for business visitors
but only three nights for vacationers, many of whom come to Indonesia as part
of tour programs covering various other countries in Southeast Asia. Average
daily expenditure was estimated at US$ 38 in 1972.
2.06      Even with the recent rapid growth in demand, tourism development
is still in its primary stage in Indonesia. Until recently, hotel accommo-
dation of an international standard was limited to less than 1,300 rooms in
Jakarta, about 450 in Bali and 100 in Jogjakarta, the three most important
destinations for foreign visitors. Over-booking was frequent and "block
reservations" over an extended period, which are essential for group travel
and particularly for charter operations, were very difficult to obtain.
Towards the end of 1973, this situation started to ease somewhat as a result
of the major expansion of hotel capacity which has been underway since 1972
in preparation for the PATAl' Conference which Indonesia hosted in March/
April 1974. This expansion will more than double the supply of internation-
ally acceptable rooms in Jakarta, Bali and Jogjakarta by mid 1974. The
buoyancy of domestic and foreign private hotel investment has been based on:
(i) the very high annual occupancy rates and favorable operating results of
existing hotels; (ii) the expectation of continued rapid growth in demand;
and (iii) the granting of attractive incentives for investors willing to
commit themselves to having the additional rooms available by the date of
the PATA Conference.
2.07      The tourism industry was recognized in the First Five-Year Plan
(1969-74) as a sector which can contribute significantly to Indonesia's de-
velopment through increased foreign exchange earnings, employment and income
generation and regional development. Bali, Java and Sumatra were given first
priority for tourism development. A national Advisory Board for Tourism was
appointed to assist the President in formulating tourism policy. A Directorate
General of Tourism under the Ministry of Communications and a number of Pro-
vincial tourism offices were set up to implement these policies. Government
action since 1969 has focused mainly on: (i) preparation for the 1974 PATA
Conference, an important tourism event that will help the country's promo-
tional efforts; (ii) carrying out a number of studies and technical assis-
tance projects, such as the Bali Tourism Master Plan, Swiss and UNDP-ILO-
supported tourism training programs, Dutch-financed studies of Java's tourism
potential and a UNDP-financed long-term study of overall tourism development
for Indonesia which was recently begun; (iii) supervision of the operations
of two Government corporations which own and manage several first-class
1/ Pacific Area Travel Association.



hotels, most of which were bu'Llt with Japanese reparations funds; and (iv)
the administration of incentives designed to attract private hotel investors,
including import duty exemptions for hotels constructed in priority areas
and a five-year corporate income tax holiday.
2.08      The Indonesian hotel industry gives direct employment to an estima-
ted 8,000 people at the present time. The contribution of tourism to
Indonesia' s foreign exchange earnings was about $50 million in gross and
$36.8 million in net foreign exchange earnings in 1973.  While still rela-
tively small--less than 5% and 3%, respectively, of non-oil exports--pros-
pects are quite favorable for continued rapid growth in tourism receipts
over the next decade.
3. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. PLANNING AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
3.01      Located next to the main island of Java, Bali continues to evoke
in the tourist's mind the idea of a tropical paradise. Bali's chief tourist
<tssets are the natural and scenic attractions of the island and, more impor-
tant, its people and their culture. This culture, held in equilibrium by a
communal society and the Hindu heritage, permeates all facets of Balinese
existence and expresses itself in a profusion of art, dance, music and
sculpture.  Hundreds of temples adorn the island and mountains rise from
among rice fields as beautiful as any in the worldl. There are still active
volcanoes in the western part of the island, and lakes lying in the craters
of inactive ones, calm and serene at the foot of great summits. Palm trees
and white sand beaches, protected by coral reefs, combined with a tropical
climate invite a relaxed approach to life. The island's major cultural and
scenic attractions are located north of Denpasar, the island's main business
center and seat of the provincial government. It is these areas that tourists
mainly visit to watch the colorful dances, listen to the enchanting music,
observe the festivals and religious ceremonies, shop for paintings and wooden
scuLlptures, or simply admire the ornate temples and the dramatic scenery.
3.02      Prior to the construction of Tuban airport in 1967, upgraded in 1971
tO take jet aircraft, tourism development in Bali was rather limited.  Since
,Ihen, a number of internationally oriented hotels have been built along the
beach areas of Sanur and Kuta, east and southwest of Denpasar. Unfortunately,
however, this development was largely unplanned and haphazard, with decisions
about location, building design, and the provision of basic infrastructure,
roads in particular, has generally lagged behind hotel construction. At
present, access to the villages and tourist attractions north of Denpasar is
over a fragile network of roads and bridges built 40 to 50 years ago, which
have become both inadequate and unsafe with the increase in tourist and com-
mercial traffic. All traffic between the airport, where most tourists arrive,
and the rapidly expanding hotel zone i-n Sanur, must at present go through
crowded Denpasar, adding to the traffitc congestion in the town.



3.03      To prevent further haphazard development, which threatens to destroy
Bali's cultural and environmental assets, the Government has endorsed the Tour-
ism Master Plan recommendation that future hotel development be concentrated
at Nusa Dua (Nap 3).  Unlike Sanur and Xuta, w1here hotel facilities infringe
on existing villages and rice fields. Nusa Dua is located on a dry, sparsely
settled peninsula (Bukit) on the southern end of the island, separated from
the most densely settled and agriculturally richest parts of Bali.  It is none-
theless an extremely attractive area, wit pal-fringed beaches of white sand
and a pleasant climate, within a reasonaDle distance from the airport. There
are several important advantages to concentrating hotel development within a
carefully planned tourism estate at Nusa Dua. The physical isolation of the
resort facilities and the institutional arrangements envisaged should insure
a controllable relationship between foreign visitors and the local population.
At the same time, the estate would provide the hotels with utilities, services
and certain common commercial, administrative and recreational facilities, thus
avoiding unnecessary duplication. Similarly, the concentration of hotels would
allow for the most economical provision of both off-site and on-site infrastruc-
ture, thus reducing the costs to hotel investors for the utilities and other
services, while allowing for a high level of control over the quality of
the environment.
3.04      The tourism estate plan is designed to ensure the most economic uti-
lization of available land without detracting from the natural environment,
while being sufficiently flexible to acconm.odate the preferences of potential
investors in hotels and other facilities, Hotel sites would be located along
the three beaches of the Nusa Dua resort, with provision for a central core
a-rea which would resemble a typical Balinese village with its harmoniously
spaced, simple structures and intensely landscaped open spaces. Private
d.evelopment activities would be guided by both physical and financial controls,
to be established and enforced by the estate management corporation (see para.
3.11 below). investors would be encouraged to use local styles and materials,
.and the height of structures would be limited to 15 m., the approximate
height of surroupnding palm trees.
3.05      In order to help assure priority development of Nusa Dua, the Govern-
ment in 1972 after consultation with the Bank Group set a limait of 1,600 hotel
rooms of internationally acceptable standard outside the Nusa Dua area, includ-
ing those already existing or under construction. Mloreover, it imposed.
height limitationso zcning regulations and building standards on new h4otel
projects in Sanur and Kuta.
3.06      In preparation for the NUsa Dua proIect, the Goverrment has acqu:iree
310 hectares of land over the last three vears,.  Tand pu.rchss hsave dicolaced
very few people, Tehile giving them the immediate benefits of cash  va menes.
The traditional occupations of loca'. villagers havJe not thus far been sgni-
ficantly disrupted since the Government h.as allowed them to continue harvesting
t:he coconuts from the trees in the area it has purchased and to continue
fishing from the Nusa Dua beaches. Moreover, the plans for the tourism estate
provide continued access to the beach areas traditionally used by local fisher-
men.  The authorities are planning special efforts to assure the maximum of
training and employment for the inhabitants of t.ie --WC near-by villages (Benoa
and Bualu) in the construction and cper.-:ton of-      tour-sm estFte T In
addition, improvements in the basic Infrnstru -  o' --.he twvo vf- es would be
provided as part of the project (see 7.ara. 4         7'naly, te      cones-an
atuthorities intend to secure a co=nitnent from the   tels to be established in.
Nusa Dua that basic medical services w?culd bDe provi(ed not only for hotel
employees but also for the population of the twSo  ed4acent villaaes.



7brx7     One majot Potentially disruptive effect of the project on the ad-
-'TLcent v-illages  nd other parts of Bukit would be the settlement of large
numbers of haotel emn.loyees in special housing near the tourism estate.
astudy.ng the experience with staff housing in other parts of Bali, it
uat oncl..uded t at such ouSLg should be held to a minimum and that tlae
z=linese a.nloyees should be encouraged to continue to live in th..eir tradi -
-1.onal  com,-umities, viich most of th.em seem to prefer, or to settle in, Greater
Denpasar.  This solution 'would, of course, require the provision of adequate
publ`.c tra nsportation and the enforement of appropriate zoning regulations
IMn the area0  A survey of transportation requirements would be carried out
aus part of. the fin.al design of project components. During negotiations, agrce-
cent was reached that appropriate zoning regulations covering the entire B3ukit
Peninsula would Tbe instituted in line with the Tourism Master Plan guidelines.
Despite. its substntial size  the proposed development is expected to have a
minimal neg.atLva impact on the physical environment. The level of pollution
of the near-by bay caused by the ships anchoring in Benoa harbor is low and
is not expectad to increase, except temporarily during the construction. phase.
Sewerage at tusa Dua is to be treated and the treated effluent discharged into
at interna. bay, .iLstnt from the beaches used for swiumLing. Nor is theere any
t7ureat of air a-ad noi,e pollution, except around the airport which is 8 mias at<way.
3XO8      With the expansion of tourism, an. increasing proportion of the popu-
lation outside the two adjacent villages will directly or indirectly be e.ngaged
in serving the tourist industry.  Through their patronage of Bali7nese art
(painting, sculpture, music and dancing), foreign visitors have markedly
stimulated sh1e 1.i;-t,erest of local inhabitants in such cultural expression.
Tourism haS  i..O uncresed the demand for a large variety of agricuiltural and
li..vestock products.  However, a large proportion of these products are curreiltly
imported because the local farmer has little knowledge or skil. to supply
regularly products of adequate quality and variety for the hotels. Furthermore,
an increas.ialg n}ser of youmg persons keenly compete to obtain hotel skills,
either by   rAkiug in existing hotels or by enrolling in ill-equipped hotel
training schols which use borrowed space and part-time teachers.  The project
consequently provi:ies technical and financial assistance to help expand and
upgrade agr-.iultura. productior and to improve hotel training facilities.
B.  INST TUT=IONAL ARRNGENTS
3.0,9     A  firSt step toward L.mplemienting the Bali Tourism Master Plan was
the establis>ment in- Mlarch 1972 of the Bali Tourism Development Board (BTDB) e
'T e fun.ctions of the BTDBR include:  (i) advisiig various Provincial Governnment
agencJ7es on. -ne praCtical application of the Master Plan; (Yii) coordinating
tourism sec`ror actitvities so as to maximize net benefits and minimize social
en'environmmtental deterioration; and (iii) creating the necessary links between
governmenta.,enecies. pri.vate tourist enterprises and Balinese community
organizations.  To facilltate these f-uanctions, the Board is composed of 1.2
representatiLves of various government agencies, with the Goverror of Bali as
Chairman: and a representative of the national Directorate of Tourism  as
Vice-Chairmmrn. he Director of the loc,al tourism office vould serve as
Executive Secretary, heading a Secretariatc which would consist of a physi-
cal plannerz  a sociologist, an economist and an expert in culture and re-
li,gion, all of viono  are expected, to bDe Balinese.



3.10      In order to implement the Master Plan effectively, to improve the
institutional links between agencies and orgaanizations involved in tourism
development and to help in devising anZ implementing appropriate tourism
policies, the Indonesian authorities have requested that technical assis-
tance, be made available to the BTDBT   Accordingly, the project includes:
(i) employment of an outside advisor who would be assigned for a period of
three years to the BTDB, and who would guide and train local cotunterpart
staff in comprehensive, urban and regional planning; and (ii) employment
of an anthropologist familiar with the social and cultural problems in Bali,
and with the potential impact of tourism, to serve as a consultant to the
BTDB for relatively short periods totaling about nine months over the next
three years. During negotiations the provision of advisory services was
agreed upon and assurances were received regarding the allocation of ade-
quate funds to the BTDB.
3.11      A second step toward implementing the Tourism Master Plan was the
establishment in November 1973 of the Bali Tourism Development Corporation
(BTDC) a limited liability corporation with the Indonesian Government as its
only shareholder, whose objective is to create a successful tourism estate on
the Bukit Peninsula at Nusa Dua.l/  The activities of the BTDC will be guided
by a Board of Supervisors to be composed of the Secretary General of Public
Works, the Director of Monetary Affairs (Department of Finance), and the Gov-
ernor of Bali, with the Director General of Tourism as Chairman. The compo-
sition of this Board should facilitate cooperation between the BTDC and other
public sector agencies involved in implementation of the tourism estate.
3.12      The corporation would be administered by a Board of Directors which
is composed of the President Director and the heads of the Technical Opera-
tions and Finance Divisions and would be assisted by a Secretariat. The
three top positions have already been filled; staffing of the Finance and
Technical Operations Divisions and the Secretariat will be completed in the
near future. This management group would be headquartered in Jakarta during
the execution phase, in order to provide coordination among the Government
agencies involved in the project. A technical field unit, to be established
in Bali, would be responsible for supervising final planning and execution
of the project, under the direction of the Technical Operations Division.
This unit would be headed by an experienced engineer, who has yet to be
appointed, and staffed with the necessary technical personnel (see Arr.ex III).
This appointment would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
A hotel training section would start operations Jln Bali in 1975.
3.13      Shortly before the project becomes operational, the management group
would relocate to Bali and assume responsib4lity for managing the touri sm
estate.  The technical field unit will be reorganized into three sections
which would be responsible, respectively, for operation and administration of
the water and sewerage system; maintenance of the roads, landscaped areas and
buildings; and environmental sanitation.  A detailed organization plan for
estate operations, including staff requirements, would be submitted to the
Association by December 31, 1975.
3.14      Because of their lack of exnerience with tourism estate  rocjects,
the Indonesian autHorities have recuested that the 3T-: receive tacchnical
assistance during the execution phase of the projnozt. Durincr rnegotiations
1/  See Annex III for a detailed description of BTDC's functions.



agreement was reached on the following advisory positions:  (i  an expert oni
tourism-related larid development ancl th.e ?-otel industry w1ho would assist in
the formulatLon of corporate ob,j ct- .ves, 1ease "olcies and  model lease
forms; (ii) a financial expert who would advise on general financial policy
and assist in the analys.s of investmet preposa. s from hotel and other com-
mercial developers; and (iii) an engineerfng expert whor would assist the
T-rector of Technnical Operat:ions  n t7-e review ofi proJect design and bid eva-
^.uations and advise the head of the field urnit on construction mangement.  One
of the major tasks of these advisors will be to provide the Indonesian teal
with on-the-job training. Terms of reference for the three advisors were
agreed upon during negotiations. The appointment of the first advisor referred
to above would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
4. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A. PRCJECT COMPONMTS
4.01      The project would consist of the following elements as shown in
Table I (para. 4.15) below and listed in more detail in Annex I:
(a) infrastructure for the tourism estate, including the
access road to the Nusa Dua area; water supply, sewerage
and solid waste disposal systems; electrical installations;
telephone and telex facilities; internal roads and streets
and stornwater drainage; landscaping and landscape irriga-
tion; common facilities and buildings; and infrastructure
improvements for the adjacent villages of Bualu and Benoa,
including water supply, sanitary units, street lighting
and street improvement;
(b) roads and bridges, including a road from Tuban airport to
Tohpati by-passing Denpasar; and improvement of eleven
multi-purpose roads in the central part of Bali;
(c)  a hotel training center accommodating 250 to 300 basic-
level trainees and 100 medium-level trainees;
(d) a lO-hectare demonstration farm, for vegetable production
and gradilng, as weLl as seed production; and
(e)  technical assistanoe to the BTDB, the BTDC and the local
office of the Ministry of Agrictulture.
These project elements are described briefly in the following paragraphs,
4.02      A two-lane road would be constructed connecting the N;usa Dua area.
with the Tuban Airport, a distance of 8 km.  (See Annex V.)
4.03      Water would be supplied to the resort area and the tWo adjacent
villages from a nepw well field to be deve.oped on the Bukit Peninsula, based
on the successful results of extensive groundwater exploration and test drill-
ing. A treatment plant, storage 1:ank and distribution system would be provided.



-9-
Sewage from the tourism area would be collected by a system of pipelines
and would be discharged into oxidation ponds. The solid waste disposal
system would include the collection and transportation of solid wastes for
disposal in sanitary landfill. (See Annex IV.)
4.04      The electrical installations provided for under the project would
consist of a 20 KV transformer station and a stand-by generator for BTDC
and of street lighting for roads, streets and public areas within the resort
area. The extension of the electricity supply system to serve the resort
area would be undertaken separately by the national power company fPLN)
under a scheme (described i Annex VI for which assistance has been request-
ed from the UK Covernment.1 Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the
Covernment is obligated to complete this component in time to meet the power
demands of the hotels at Nusa Dua.
4.05      A new telephone exchange with a capacity of 600 lines would be
erected in the resort area and would be connected to Jakarta through the
existing Denpasar exchange. Ten telex extensions would also be provided
in the resort area.
4.06      Within the resort area, a secondary road and street network of
some 11 km would be constructed in order to provide access to common facil-
ities and hotel sites. Public parking areas would also be provided. Storm-
water would generally be collected in open ditches and lead to swales where
it would infiltrate into the ground.
4.07      Landscaping plans provide for improvement of the existing charac-
teristics of the resort area, with plants to be supplied from a nursery set
up within the project area. To combat the shortage of surface water at
Nusa Dua, a separate irrigation scheme using raw water drawn from wells
located in or near the plant nursery would be provided.
4.08      The amenity core and the service center of the tourism estate
would provide facilities such as an information center, a post office, a
bank, shops, an art performance center, offices, a fire and a police station.
4.09      Development of the resort area would make it possible to provide,
at relatively small incremental costs, infrastructure improvements in the
two adjacent villages, Bualu and Benoa, which would substantially improve
the standard of living of the inhabitants. Roads would be improved and paved
and some streetlighting erected. In addition, community service units would
be constructed providing public water supply and washing and toilet facili-
ties. A first aid station would be installed in each village.
4.10      A two-lane road from Tuban Airport to the town of Tohpati would
be conistructed to provide the existing and rapidly expanding hotel zone at
Sanur with direct access from the airport, to greatly ease traffic conges-
tion in Denpasar, and to permit visitors from the Nusa Dua, Kuta and Sanur
resort areas to visit major cultural and scenic attractions located north
of Denpasar without having to go through the city.
tI Tlhe extension of the electricity supply system is not reflected in the
cost estimates or financing plan (paras. 4.15 and 4.29), but is taken
ilto account in the economic justification of the project.

4.11      The improvement of eleven existirng roads, totaling about 200 kms,
would provide better access for tourists to the major cultural and scenic
attractions north of Denpasar and ease general traffic serving the Island's
most important and densely populated agricultural areas. No major changes
are proposed in the existing alignment of these roads. Improvement consists
primarily of upgrading road surfaces anid drainage, minor realignment of
curves, and replacement of inadequate and potentially hazardous bridges
(see Annex V).
4.12      The project includes funds that would finance the construction of
a training center with proper physical facilities and equipment.  The new
training center wouild be operated by a small staff of full-time teachers
for whom housing would be provided aLnd a number of part-time instrnuctors
who would train an estimated 300 to 400 trainees annually Lo meet projected
expansion of hotel capacity.  The center would provide primarily basic- and
medium-level training, including foreign languages, without excluding the
possibility of special management and higner-level training once the new
institution is firmly established. (see Annex VII).
4.13      To help local farmers grow food products suitable for interna-
tionally oriented hotels and restaurants, the project would provide for the
acquisition of 10 ha of land, civil works and equipment required for a small
demonstration farm, to be established by the Bali Office of the Ministry of
Agriculture. The objectivew ofthis farm would be to demonstrate the produc-
tion of new vegetables and their grading, to produce vegetable seeds, and to
assist farme-s in contract negotiations with hotels and restaurants. In
order to establish the farm and operate it successfully, an agricultural
advisor would be employed full time for about three years. Besides advising
on the implementation of this project component, the advisor would be chiefly
responsible for training the counterpart staff who would be responsible for
operating the farm. At the same time a program to increase and improve
poultry and egg production is provided for which would include about two man-
months of technical assistance and a small amount of special medium-term
credit from the Bank Rakyat Indonesia. Finally, the Bali Agricultural
Office together with BTDC would attempt to secure the cooperation of the
thotels in establishing a jointly financed, small modern slaughterhouse in
order to improve the quality of buitchered meat for the hotels and restaurants.
They would also attempt to secure equitable marketing arrangements for local
livestock producers (see Annex VIII).
4.14      Technical assistance included in the project would cover the for-
eign expertise required by the Ba,Li Tourism Development Corporation (para.
3.14);the assistance needed by the Bali Tourism Development Board (para. 3.10);
and the services of technical advisors on vegetable farming, and poultry and
egg production, to the Bali Office of the Ministry of Agriculture (para. 4.13).

4.17      Base line cost estimates have been adjusted to account for price
level changes since the appraisal mission in July 1973 and now reflect
January 1974 prices. Provision has been made for continued price increases
in site works, building and equipment costs based on projections of likely
price level changes during the construction period. In addition, an
allowance of 15% of the civil work and equipment costs has been made to
cover physical contingencies. This is reasonable since most of the cost
estimates are based on semi-detailed engineering studies and on cost data
for similar works in Bali and Java. The details of the allowances made for
price and physical contingencies are shown in Annex I, Table 1.8. The total
provision for contingencies amounits to 42.6% of base line costs or 29.9% of
total project cost.
4.18      For professional services required in the final design and con-
struction supervision stages, an allowance of 10% of the civil work and
equipment costs has been made.
4.19      Cost estimates for project buildings are based on space require-
ments and unit building costs. Lists of furniture and equipment would be
prepared during the detailed design stage and reviewed bv the Association.
Local currency cost estimates for equipment include local taxes, port, ware-
housing and handling charges, and transportation to sites which together
are equivalent to about 27% of the c.i.f. prices.
4.20      It is proposed that certain expenditures, including part of the
cost of water investigation and well drilling, final engineering design and
initial technical assistance to the BTDC(amounting to about US$350,000 or
1.0% of total project costs), be financed retroactively from the IDA credit.
C. EXECUTION AND OPERATIONS
4.21      Four agencies would be responsible for the execution of the physical
components of the project: (i) the Bali Tourism Development Corporation (BTDC);
(ii) the Highway Department of the Ministry of Public Works (Bina Marga); (iii)
the National Thlecommunications Corporation (Perumtel); and (iv) the Bali
Office of the Ministry of Agriculture.
4.22      BTDC, which would own the land at Nusa Dua, would have overall res-
ponsibility for coordinating the execution of the project. BTDC would also
be responsible, with the assistance of consultants acceptable to the Associa-
tion, for the design, construction and operation of the works at Nusa Dua,
including the water supply and sewerage system, solid waste disposal, land-
scaping, stormwater drainage, roads and streets in Ntusa Dua, electrical instal-
lations (for all BTDC items), amenity core and cormunity facilities, infrastruc-
tuLre improvements at the villages of Bualu and Benoa and the hotel training center.
4.23      Bina Marga, the highway department of the Ministry of Public Works,
would be responsible for the design, construction and maintenance of all road-
works and bridges outside the resort area.
4.24      The telecommunications component, consisting of telephone and telex
facilities, would be implemented by Perumtel which has the overall responsi-
bility for telecommunications in Indonesia. It is well qualified to carry
out the work, including final design.



- 14
4.25      The hotel training cernter to be established and ooerated by BTDC
would be built on land already set aside for this purpose by the Government
or Bali.  From May to August, 1974, an ILO team, financed by  NIDP under an
ongoing vocational training pro&ect: would help the Indonesian tourism autho-
rities and BTDC prepare a schedule of accommodation and equipment require-
ments for the construction and equipping for the center, as well as detailed
proposals for its staffing, curricula and criteria for student select:ion.
BTDC would employ consultants tc) prepare final design and supervise con-
struccion. To advise the BTDC on local aspects of the operation of the
hotel school, a committee would be established on which the hotels and the
Bali tourism office would be represented0
4.26      The local office of the Ministry of Agriculture, with the assist-
ance of the advisors referred to in para. 4.13, would establish and operate
the demonstration farm and develop and implemenit a program for the improve-
ment of poultry and egg production.,
4.27      To help ensure proper coordination during the execution of the
project, BTDC would be responsible for preparing, and submitting to the
Association by December 31, 1974, a critical path network for carrying out
all parts of the project. This net-work would be reviewed internally by all
parties concerned every three months, and the results of such reviews would
be communicated to the Association every six months.
D. FINANCING PLAN AND LENDING ARRANGEMENTS
4.28      The total estimated cost of the project is Rps 14,982 million (US$36.1
million equivalent).  It is proposed that the IDA credit would cover about 88%
of the foreign exchange component of Rps 7,512 million (US$18.1 million equiv-
alent), or roughly 44% of the total project cost.  The balance would be
provided through budgetary allocations of the Government, which would also
meet any cost overruns.
4.29      The consolidated financing plan for the project, excluding inter-
est during construction and working, capital, can be summarized as follows:

4.30      The Government has agreed that its contribution to BTDC would be
made available as equity, while the proceeds of the IDA credit would be on-
lent at 12% interest (the standard rate for government loans of this type)
for a period of 30 years, including six years' grace. The Government would
allow the BTDC to capitalize interest charges during the grace period and
to repay them over a period of about 15 years thereafter. The conclusion
of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and BTDC, satisfac-
tory to the Association, would be a condition of effectiverness.
4.31      The Government would make the relevant part of the proceeds of
the IDA credit available to ierumtel at 127, interest for a period of 20 years
including five years' grace. The conclusion of a subsidiary credit agreement
between the Government and Perumtel, satisfactory to the Association, would
be a condition of effectiveness.
4.32      The Government contribution and the proceeds of the IDA credit
required for the project components to be carried out by BTDB, Bina Marga
and the Bali Provincial Government would be made available as budgetary
allocations without interest or repayment requirements.
E. PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENTS
4.33      Major civil works and equipment contracts would be awarded under
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines.
Project items would be grouped to the extent possible in order to encourage
such competitive bidding. With respect to the improvements on the eleven
multipurpose roads, contracts would be tendered either individually or
combined into bidding groups, at the bidders option, in order to permit
local contractors to tender for works of a size within their capabilities
and to attract foreign bidders. Only local competitive bidding would be
used for small civil works contracts, such as the construction of some
buildings at Nusa Dua, the preparation of the solid waste disposal site,
and the improvement of infrastructure for the adjacent villages of Bualu
and Benoa. The value of each such contract is estimated not to exceed
about US$100,000. The total amount of these contracts would amount to
about US$0.5 million. In evaluating international bids, domestic contrac-
tors would be accorded a 7.5% nominal preference. The exploratory and
initial well drilling for water, for which partial, retroactive financing
from the IDA credit is proposed, was awarded after consultation with the
Association to experienced engineers and contractors already engaged in
similar work in the areas. (See para. 4.20)
4.34      It is expected that furniture contracts, amounting to about
US$250,000, would require only local competitive bidding since they would
not be of interest to overseas firms. Telecommunications equipment pro-
cured under the project would have to be compatible with that presently
being used in Bali, and it is therefore proposed that Perumtel negotiate
the purchase with manufacturers of this equipment. The smount involved
would be about US$150,000. In evaluating international bids for other equip-
ment contracts, local manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin
of 15% of the c.i.f. costs of competing imports or the prevailing level of
customs duties, whichever is lower.



4.35       Responsibility f or acdv       r-- Stequests f-or tanders, issuing tender
documents, evaluatinag bids a-nd ac oLtracts for eacrh of the project
components would be that of the -respective agency responsible for execution
(see section C, para. 4.21 on ?rck,e.t Execution).
4.36       The proposed credit of US$'16.0 mili.on would be disbursed to meet:
(a)  507% of total expendit res "for civvil works;
(b)  100% of the ci,i,f, cist of- directly imported equipment
and furniture, 95' iD of- the ex-factory cost of' locally
manufactured equi; ment and fut- miture ar-d 70% of the
total cost of off--the-shelf items; and
(c)  100% of the foreign exchange cost of professional
services, project admiinistration and technical as-
sistance specialists,
These percentages would be adjusted as -necessary to ensure continued disburse-
ments throughout the constructioni pe-riod.  The estimated schedule of disburse-
ments of the credit is shown in A9nnex 1, Table 1.7.
5.  JUSTIFICATION
A. MARKET DMANM
5.01      Bali's appeal to the inte7rnational tourist market is based on its
long standing image among foreigners as an exotic island of Southeast Asia
with a unique culture, and on its strategic position close to the three
most highly developed tourist centers in Southeast Asia. It is also on the
direct route from Australia to the mainland of Asia.  In spite of this, Bali
has not been able to benefit much from the remarkable growth in tourist traf-
fic to Southeast Asia during the past five years because of a severe scarcity
of acceptable accommodations. Arn indication of this is the fact that Bali's
average rate of growth in tourist traffic was just about half of that for
Indonesia as a whole. The tourists likely to be attracted to Bali comprise
three distinct market segments:  (iJ vacation tourists on multiple-stop tours
throughout Southeast Asia from North America, Europe and Japan; (ii) vacation
tourists from Australia, New Zealand, other neighboring countries in South-
east Asia and in the longer run from Japan for whom Bali mmight increasingly
become a single destination resort; and (iii) business travelers to Indonesia,
for whom the trip to Bali would be an attractive excursion, as well as resident
foreigners who might well be attracted for extended vacation periods.
5.02      The market for multiple-stop group tours throughout Southeast Asia
has expanded very rapidly in recent years, but has thus far hardly been tapped
by Bali. The potential of this market may be gauged by noting that the number
of visitor arrivals to Singapore, BangLkok and Hongkong grew by 20% per annum
on the average over the last five veazs reaching 783,000, 821,000 and 1,082,000
respectively in 1972.  Of the total nu,=be-- oL visitors, over 60% were on vaca-
tion, most of them on group tour    A.t   esent bali receives less than 5% of
total tourists visiting the three major tourist centers of Southeast Asia.



_ 17 _
,n 1974, for the first time the island will be able to start to take advantage
of the previously unsatisfied demand for individual and group tour bookings,
because of the sizeable additions to accommodation capacity which have recently
taken place or are now being commissioned. The group tour market appears a
most promising one for Bali; the island complements rather than competes with
the other destinations in the area and provides an additional attraction for
visitors to the Southeast Asia region. Such visitors on multi-destination
tours are likely to spend not more than 2-3 days on the island, Although
there might well be a substantial slowing in the rate of growth of the multiple-
stop group tours to Southeast Asia, due to the impact of the energy crisis,
Bali's inclusion in an increasing number of the tours already operating would
limit the impact of this slowdown. Group tours are expected to account for
two-thirds of the future tourist traffic to Bali.
5.03      The number of Australians and other vacationists coming from
neighboring countries to Bali as a single destinations has been growing
significantly in recent years and is estimated to have reached about 10,000
in 1973. Tour operators expect that the increasing availability of Group
Inclusive Tours (GIT) rates and charter flights will lead to a very marked
expansion in the flow of such tourists once more accommodation is available
in Bali. Australian vacationists are already coming to Bali for relatively
longer periods than other tourists. They tend to spend up to three weeks
in Bali. There is reason to believe that this market will be little
affected by the energy crisis (see Annex IX).
5.04      Business travellers to Indonesia, mainly Jakarta, still account
for the largest part of total arrivals to Indonesia as a whole. This seg-
ment of Bali's market has not been developed to its full potential, again
because of the lack of suitable accommodation in Bali and the considerable
difficulty in obtaining airline reservations at short notice. The increas-
ing attractiveness of Indonesia as a country with important oil and gas
resources, and other investment opportunities, will tend to increase the
flow of business visitors to Indonesia and probably also the number of
foreign businessmen, technicians and officials resident in the country.
These will constitute an expanding potential market for Bali, and a market
strengthened rather than impaired by the energy crisis.
5.05      Tourist arrivals in Bali have been growing at a rate of about 27%
per year since 1969, and numbered 95,000 in 1973. The past trends, and
possible future market developments are analyzed in detail in Annex IX.
This analysis takes into account the potential impact of the energy crisis
which is expected to result in a marked slowdown of economic growth in the
major tourist originating countries during the next few years. While this,
combined with the likelihood of increased airfares and possible devaluations
of major currencies, will most certainly have an effect on the future growth
of tourist traffic to Southeast Asia, the particular characteristics of the
Bali tourism market noted above provide at least a partial insurance against
major adverse changes in future demand growth, since each of the market
segments mentioned in para. 5.01 has some counter-balancing factors in case
of a decline in growth of overall international tourist flows.
5.06      An additional factor which could be important in the development
of future tourism demand is the air access policy that will be adopted by
the Government of Indonesia regarding Bali. Most of the foreign visitors
arrive in Bali by air. At present a total of 73 flights arrive in Bali



- 18 -
weekly. Of this total, 42 are domestic flights, 25 flights combirie dom-
estic and international air service through Jakarta, and six are direct
international flights. In bilateral negotiations on air traffic rights,
the Government is seeking a substantial share of the air traffic to Bali
for the national airline, Garuda. As part of this effort, the Government
has informed foreign airlines serving Bali that they will not be permitted
to use Bali as a terminating point in Indonesia; if a terminating point is
desired, it would have to be Jakarta.  Airlines serving Bali o /through
flights, such as Singapore/Bali/Sydney, would not be affected.-  The Govern-
ment has not announced any intention to apply such restrictions to charter
fliglts, but has indicated that it will encourage joint ventures and pooling
arrangements between Garuda and foreign airlines. The Indonesian authori-
ties are currently reviewing these questions in order to find-solutions
whichi would permit Indonesia to tap its promising tourism market wnile safe-
guarding the interests of the national airline.
5.07      Given the above demand characteristics and likely impact of the
energy crisis, it is projected that Bali as a wiole would receive 287,000
foreign visitors in 1978, when the first hotels at Nusa Dua are scheduled
.o open, and 540,000 by 1983 when all 2,500 hotel rooms will be in operation.
These estimates are based on the assumption that the number of foreign visi-
tor arrivals to Bali would grow at an average annual rate of 26% fro-m 1973-
77. Because of the higher absolute number of visitors and a. gradual elimin-
ation of unsatisfied demand, it is assumed that the growth rate would decline
during the subsequent six-year period of 1978-83 to 14%.  The average annual
growth rate during 1973-83 is assumed to be 19%.
5.08      While these projections are considered quite reasonable, there is
still a distinct element of uncertainty regarding the impact of the energy
crisis. To test the sensitivity of the tourist traffic to Bali-to a more
severe impact than is assumed likely, three alternative projections have
been made for the period 1978-1983/85 when the hotels in the Nusa Dua resort
would be expected to come into operation. All of these alternative projec-
tions assume that in the next four years (1974-77) the tourist traffic to
13ali would only grow at an average rate of 17% annually rather than at a
rate of 26% as stated in para. 5.08, or at the much higher rate (40-50%)
which might have been expected in the absence of the energy crisis.  This
assumption allows for the less likely case that the full effect of a marked
slowing down in growth of travel to Southeast Asia would make itself felt
in Bali witlhout being offset by the compensating factors noted previously.
The variations in the alternative projections for the period 1978-1983/85
reflect differing assumptions regarding the time required for the recovery
of the market from this setback.
5.09)     Based on thle foregoing the projected numbers of foreign visitor
arrivals in Bali are as follows:
l/ As a restilt of this policy, two airlines have discontinued flights to
Bali; three other major air carriers, however, continue to serve Bali
on through flights.

5.10      Past experience indicates that the average daily expenditure of
tourists to Bali on group or package tours is higher than the average tourist
expenditure in Indonesia as a whole. The estimated average amount of US$46
per day (in 1973 prices) includesaccpmnodation, food and beverages, sight-
seeing and entertainment.
B. Hotel Development
5.11      As mentioned in paras. 3.02-3.03, an expansion of the hotel capacity
in Bali is already underway and the Government has taken a number of steps to
ensure that future hotel development, including that outside Nusa Dua, would
bie consistent with the objective of preserving the character of Bali while
reaping the benefits from an increased flow of tourists to the island. The
E'ATA workshop, which met in Bali in March 1974, has provided a major impetus
for Governmental action and resulting investor interest.  Existing hotels
and those already under construction will provide a total of 1,050 interna-
tionally acceptable rooms during 1974. During the subsequent three years
another 500 to 600 rooms are scheduled for completion within the limit
piresently set by the Government for hotel development outside of Nusa Dua
(see para. 3.04).
5.12      The following table shows four possible phasings of hotel develop-
mtent in Nusa Dua and the resultant occupancy rates, on the assumption that
hotel investors key their investment decisions to the alternative market
projections described in paras. 5.08-5.10 above:

Includes 1,550 rooms of internationally acceptable standards outside Nusa Dua.
5.13      A projection of the gross operating profits for hotels in the Nusa
Dua resort is given in Annex IX, Table 8, assuming occupancy rates ranging
from 55% to 75%. According to these estimates, the gross operating profits
would result in a return of about 15% on the capital invested in hotels,
after allowing for the charges to be made for utilities and other services
to be provided at the resort. After deducting land-lease payments, manage-
ment fees, and depreciation charges, the return on total capital invested
would amount to about 12%. The return on equity would, of course, depend
both on the capital structure of the investor and on the terms and condi-
tions of debt financing; on any reasonable assumption regarding terms and
conditions of loans, however, the return on equity should prove attractive.
5.14      The Government has already had preliminary contacts with a number
of interested local and foreign investors (see list in Annex IX), some of
whom have tenatively chosen specific sites and are now awaiting clarifica-
tion of the lease terms and other conditions for investment in Nusa Dua.
The interest already indicated by investors supports the conclusion that
prospects for hotel investment are favorable. Negotiations with potential
investors would commence once the financial plans of the project are complete,
final designs are initiated, BTDC has formulated a definite set of policies,
and after proposals of hotel investors and operators have been carefully
reviewed with respect to the reputation of the firms, their financial
capability and their market connectionls. It is noteworthy that among those
interested in an early investment at Nusa Dua is an Indonesian group closely
linked to the country's oil indust.ry which intends to engage a prominent
international hotel firm as operator for an 800-room hotel to be built in
two stages. In addition, at least one Japanese and one Australian group have
indicated immediate interest in each building a 200-250-room hotel within the
resort. To ensure that priority is indeed given to the development of Nusa
Dua, agreement was reached during negotiations that until 1985 the Government
would continue to limit the number of internationally acceptable hotel rooms
outside Nusa Dua to 1,600, subject :0o periodic review of the limit by the
Government and the Association.

C. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
5.15      The gross benefits resulting from the tourism resort area investment
program1/ would be the expenditures in Bali of tourists who stay in Nusa Dua
hotels. Because of the rather severe shortage of acceptable accommodation in
the major tourist destinations in Indonesia, the Nusa Dua hotel visitors would
represent previously untapped demand, including both the expansion of group-
tour visitors and the inducement to business travelers to extend their stay
in Indonesia long enough to take in the attractions of Bali. These benefits
are, therefore, incremental to Indonesia as a whole and do not represent a
diyversion of traffic from existing destinations in Indonesia. Although some
portion of the (net) revenues accruing to the Indonesian airlines from interna-
tional tourist traffic is properly attributable to the project, the actual
share going to Garuda will depend very much on the Governmentts air access
policy which is currently under review. Because of this uncertainty, benefits
from international travel have not been taken into account in calculating proj-
ect rates of return. The relevant costs are the capital and operating costs
of the infrastructure provided under the proposed project, and of the hotel
and related superstructure facilities of the resort, plus the estimated capital
and operating costs relating to the expenditures of Nusa Dua hotel guests
outside of the resort area.
5.16      Revenue assumptions have been based on an average daily expenditure
per visitor of about US$46.00, including accommodation, food and beverages
(US$27.30); shopping (US$8.00); tours and transportation (US$6.00); and enter-
tainment and recreation (US$4.70). Hotel revenues assume an average length
of stay of 3.5 days, a double-occupancy factor of 1.7 persons per room, and
an annual room occupancy rate for each hotel of 55% in the first year, rising
to 75% by the third year of operations. Gross operating profits of the hotels
and other superstructure facilities have been estimated on the basis of the
experience of similar facilities now in operation in Bali. Gross revenues
and operating costs of the utilities have been based on projected consumption
by the hotels and other resort facilities, while the operating costs of non-
revenue earning infrastructure (such as roads and street-lighting) have been
accounted for in the gross operating profits of the BTDC.
5.17      Total capital costs relating to these expenditures (excluding price
contingencies and the roads component outside of the resort) amount to about
US$86.0 million, including investments in infrastructure (US$22.0 million),_/
hotels (US$62.5 million) and superstructure facilities outside of Nusa Dua
(US$1.5 million).
5.18      With an estimated economic life of the project of 25 years, the
economic rate of return on the resort area investment program would be 18.7%.
It has not been found appropriate to use a shadow price for land or foreign
exchange in calculating the economic return. Given the extent of unemploy-
ment and underemployment in Bali, the opportunity cost of labor, in terms of
1/ The tourism resort area investment program includes site development and
infrastructure works for the Nusa Dua hotel complex plus the costs of
hotels and other superstructure facilities. These investments represent
about 90% of the total proposed program of investments. The other 10%
involves a roads component outside the resort area, described in para.5.23.
2/ Inicluding the electricity facilities expected to be financed by the UK
Government.



- 22 -
output foregone in other sec-tors, is likely to be lower than the wages paid
to employees of the resort. Consequently, while actual wage levels have been
used in calculating the rate of return given above, two additional rates of
return have been calculated to test the project's sensitivity to shadow
wages 15% and 30% below actual wages (see para. 5.21).
5.19      Tt has been assumed that foreign investors would be interested in
devel:oping hotels at Nusa Dua (para. 5.15). If we assume that about half
of the equity capital, and nearly all of the debt capital for hotel invest-
ments would come from abroad, the rate of return on the purely domestically
financed investment (including the IDA credit, but excluding both the foreign
private investment and the net repayments and other returns accruing to
foreigners) would be '23.0%. This is because foreign hotel investors would
not participate in those benefits of the project arising from tourist expen-
ditures outside the hotels and would receive an after-tax return on invest-
ment somewhat lower than the project's overall rate of return, thus raising
the share and the rate of return accruing to domestic capital (including
the IDA-financed portion). As the returns both on the overall:project and
on the Indonesian funds invested in it (including IDA funds) are quite
satisfactory, the project is acceptable under any reasonable assumption
about its impact on foreign capital inflow into the Indonesian economy
(see Annex XI, para. 22).
5.0      The rate of return would be sensitive to changes in several
project variables, as shown below:

5.21      The situation that would develop in Bali without the Nusa Dua
project has been reviewed (Annex XI), with the following conclusions:
(i) while it is possible that substantial expansion of accommodation capa-
city would still take place elsewhere in Bali over the next ten years, the
pattern of this development would be dispersed, and its planning generally
uncoordinated and haphazard; (ii) as a result, this alternative would
generate substantially higher social and economic costs because of the
required diversion of rice-land, potentially higher infrastructure invest-
ments due to the absence of economies of concentration, and greatly reduced
government control over the impact of tourism development which would
substantially increase the risk of both cultural and environmental damage;
(iii) at the same time it is not clear whether, through unplanned and
scattered development, anything like the 2,500 international quality hotel
rooms envisaged for Nusa Dua would be built by 1983, and a reduction in the
quantity or quality of projected hotel rooms would make doubtful the achieve-
ment of either the projected gross benefits or the projected foreign exchange
earnings and employment creation; and (iv) not only would the economic rate
of return on the Nusa Dua project be clearly higher than for the alternative
case, but also the continuation of haphazard tourism development which this
alternative represents could seriously endanger the very assets which are
the foundation of the tourism industry in Bali.
5.22      In addition to the tourism resort area investment program, the
prcject would include a roads component outside of the Nusa Dua complex.
This component consists of: (a) improvement of a number of multipurpose roads
which would provide better access for the tourists to the temples and other
tourist attractions north of Denpasar, and (b) construction of a by-pass
road around the presently very congested city of Denpasar. Since the level
of tourist-related traffic on these roads would be quite small (10-15%), as
compared with commercial and other private traffic, their evaluation has been
carried out on the basis of benefits accruing to road-users in terms of
vehicle operating cost savings.l/  With an estimated life of 20 years, the
rates of return on the multipurpose roads would be about 20% on average. The
return on the Denpasar by-pass road would be about 15%, without taking into
account non-quantifiable benefits resulting from an improvement in the urban
environment (see Annex XI, paras. 25-33). When the roads component and the
tourism resort area components are combined, the overall rate of return
is 18.5%.
D. Employment and Balance of Payments Effects
5.23      Assuming a ratio of 2.0 employees per room, the hotels on Nusa Dua
would generate about 5,000 new jobs by 1983. Additional jobs created in
restaurants, shops, tour agencies, entertainment and recreational facilities
ard the BTDC would amount to about 800-1,000 new positions, for a total
increase in direct employment of 5,800-6,000 persons. Indirect employment
/ While the tourism traffic on these roads and in the by-pass road, would
be only a small portion of total traffic, the roads are essential for
further tourism development. Hence, an additional rate of return calcu-
lation was made for the tourism resort investment program--including the
cost of the roads component, but leaving out road-user benefits. The
resulting rate of return was 16.0%.



- 24 -
is more difficult to estimate but, on the basis of tourist expenditures in
the shops, an additional 3,7C' new jobs may be created for artists and handi-
craft workers. Indirect emipLoyment generated in agriculture is likely to be
related primarily to the shift to higher value, more labor-intensive crops
for tourist consumption but, given the current state of underemployment in
agriculture, no estimate has been made of the number of new jobs this would
involve.
.24       The proposed project is expected to increase gross foreign ex-
change earnings by about US$10.7 million in 1978 when the first hotels open
and by US$48.1 million per year from 1985 when the project's "typical year"
occupancy has been reached. This comnpares with an estimated US$50 million
earned by tourism in Indonesia as a whole in 1973. Of the total expenditures
by Nusa Dua resort guests, over 85% would represent foreign exchange revenues.
Hotel income has been calculated on the basis of net tour operator prices
for group tours, and foreign exchange revenues accruing to Indonesian air-
lines from international air travel has been excluded from the estimated
gross foreign exchange earnings.
5.25      The foreign exchange outflow relating to the tourism resort invest-
ment would comprise the import comnponent of operating costs (estimated at
about 40% currently for hotels on Bali), debt service on foreign hotel loans,
management fees and dividend payments to foreign management firms and hotel
investors, and debt service on the IDA credit.  The total outflow of foreign
exchange is estimated to amount to US$2.2 million in 1978, rising to US$11.9
million per year from 1985 on.
5.26      On the basis of the foreign exchange revenues and costs described
above, the net foreign exchange earnings generated by the project would
amount to about US$8.5 million in 1978, and about US$36.2 million per year
from 1985.  This may be compared witlh the estimated foreign exchange component
of the infrastructure project of US$18.1 million including price contingencies,
and the estimated foreign exchange component of superstructure of ahout
US$25.0 million.
E.  Government Tax Revenues
5.27      In addition to the net income generated by the wholly government-
owned Bali Tourism Development Corporation, the Indonesian authorities are
expected to collect corporate income taxes from hotels amounting to about
US$1.5 million in 1985, and over IJS$2.0 million annually after 1990.
Municipal governments are expected to receive sales tax receipts from hotels
and restaurants amounting to about US$0.7 million in 1978, rising to US$2.8
million from 1985 onward.
F. Social Impact
Basic Issues
5.28      The rewards of a visit i:o Bali have been enjoyed for decades by
only a small and hardy group of world travellers. As the number of foreign
visitors increases, however, from 95,000 in 1973 to an estimated 540,000 per
year by 1983, the possibility of siglificantly deleterious effects on the
culture and environment of Bali muy be expected to increase correspondingly.



- 25 -
Tourism development in any country will be accompanied by potentially negative
effects in terms of both cultural change and environmental deterioration. In
order to promote the development of tourism in Bali with minimal negative
effects, the Indonesian authorities have attempted, with the assistance of IDA
and several consulting groups, to anticipate potential problems and to develop
and implement carefully planned solutions (paras. 5.37-5.3g>.
5.29      Assuming that the negative effects can be controlled, it is expected
that the positive effects--in terms of increased employment, incomes and
foreign exchange earnings--will result in an overall impact which, on balance,
is desirable. This comparison of social costs and benefits involves a classic
trade-off between economic development and cultural and environmental change.
Even if the negative impact of tourism is minimized, there will still be
changes in the way of life of the people and in their physical setting which
are extremely difficult--if not impossible--to quantify. Certain value
judgments are, therefore, inescapable. Where the current level of income
and employment is sufficiently low, however, the "way of life" cannot be
divorced from the "standard of living"--and the prospects for economic devel-
opment must be weighed accordingly.
5.30      In assessing the social impact of tourism, it is also necessary to
distinguish between tourism-related effects and the forces of change relating
to urbanization--as in the increasingly "Westernized" appearance of Denpasar--
and modernization, per se--as reflected in the substitution of electric light
bulbs and aluminum offering bowls in the temples. The simple fact is that
the Balinese culture, as expressed in the way of life of the people, is not,
and never has been, static. Theirs is a living, dynamic society which has for
hunlreds oF years adapted with remarkable flexibility to the forces of change.
Tourism development represents only one such force.
5.31      Unlimited growth in tourist arrivals over the long term, of course,
could eventually result in a tourism industry on Bali whose sheer magnitude
might cause a significant backlash in the host culture. It is important,
however, to place this possibility in a numerical perspective. In 1973, Bali
received about 95,000 foreign tourists, as compared with the island's popula-
tion of 2.3 million people. By 1985, when the Nusa Dua projecc is in full
operation, foreign arrivals are projected to be in the neighborhood of 540,000
per year, as compared with a population of 2.5-2.7 million people, a ratio of
about 1:5 (tourists to locals). By comparison in 1971 with a population of
34 million people, Spain received 25 million foreign tourists--a ratio of
nearly 3:4. The social impact of arrival numbers, however, must take into
consideration the average length of stay and, hence, the average number of
tourists expected to be in Bali on any given day. With an average length of
stay of 3.5 days, there would be about 5,300 visitors per day in Bali--a
ratio of one tourist to every 500 local inhabitants by 1985. While this would
appear to be a manageable number of tourists, given the concentration of
future hotel developments away from the main population centers, the autho-
rities will have to review the situation periodically and assess the desir-
ability of imposing a limit on the number of tourists who can be permited
to visit the island.
Social Impact of Tourism in Bali
5.32      While the people of Bali have welcomed foreign tourists as guests
for many decades, and have displayed a remarkable cultural resilience in
doing so, there is good reason to be concerned about the social and cultural



- 26 -
inpact of tourism developmenu on Bali.  At least four major aspects of this
impact need to be considered:  (a) the 'demonstration eff iect" of a large num-
ber of relatively wealthy foreign visitors; (b) the effects of "commercializa-
tion" on Balinese art, handicrafts, music and dance performances; (c) the
impact of tourist behavior and numbers on temple life and religious ceremonies;
and (d) the concentration of benefits from the development of tourism.
5.33      If past experience may be relied upon, the demonstration effect of
tourism is unlikely to pose much of a problem. The Balinese people have
evidanced a rather striking capacity for not being unduly influenced by either
the idiosyncracies or the excesses cf their foreign guests.  Their obvious
reluctance to imitate the behavicr of foreigners is most probably based on the
view that it is inferior to their own--as reflected, for example, in the
Balinese abhorrence of excess consumption.l/ Similarly, the obviously hectic
schedule of a busload of tourists attempting to "do" Bali in 2-3-days has a
distinct lack of appeal when compared with the relaxed way of life of the
Balinese. If anything, we may hope for a kind of reverse demonstration effect
which, in fact, is part of the appeal of Bali for the foreign visitor.
5.34      Many local observers have complained about a deterioratio9 in the
quality of the "arts" as a result: of increasing commercialization.- While it
is difficult to be precise about the extent of the problem, one can detect a
rather considerable range of quality in the handicraft goods now available
in Bali.  Similarly, the range of cultural performances, dances in particular,
is somewhat limited and is normally confined to a selection of the most "popular"
numbers. One must, of course, recognize the significance of the desires of
the purchasing public, whose tastes may be quite different from knowledgeable
local art patrons. Foreign visitors can hardly be expected to be discerning
critics of a totally unfamiliar artistic expression. It is equally under-
standable for Balinese artists and performers to orient their efforts toward
supplying this less discerning--and hence less demanding--foreign market.
Unfortunately, however, while the artists and performers who live near the
major resort areas devote their time and talents almost exclusively to the
foreign market, to the neglect of classical art forms, those in the non-
tourist areas have ample time to devote to classical art, but lack the
necessary patronage to maintain and further their skills.
5.35      Concern has also been expressed regarding the sometimes disrespect-
ful behavior of foreign tourists in and around the Balinese temples. While
the Balinese people seem not to be particularly offended as yet, it could
well become a significant problem as the number of foreign tourists increases.
While a program of "cultural awareness" for arriving visitors would help to
sensitize tourists to local customs, it may also be necessary at some point
to regulate the tour group routes and schedules so as to minimize the impact
on temple life of these increased visitor flows.
5.36      The problem of the concentration of benefits from tourism is
primarily an economic issue. Its social implications, however, cannot be
ignored since the attitude of the Balinese toward foreign visitors will be
influenced by the extent of their participation in the benefits of tourism
development. In addition to the geographic concentration of tourism benefits
1/ The most repulsive character in Balinese drama is the actor representing
sloth and gluttony.
2/ This is not a new complaint, having been voiced as early as 1933 in a
book about Bali by M. Covarrubias, a noted Mexican &nthropologist.



- 27 -
around the major resort areas, there is also the problem of ensuring that
the Balinese workers who supply the basic ingredients of tourism consumption
(artists, performers, agricultural workers, etc.) receive a more equitable
share of the tourists' dollar than is now the case.l/
Maximizing Net Social Benefits
5.37      Obviously, a number of steps will be required in order to maximize
the positive aspects, and minimize the negative aspects of future tourism
development on Bali. This fact was recognized very early in the preparation
of the Nusa Dua tourism project and, as noted in Chapter 3, "Project Back-
ground", a considerable amount of time and effort has been expended by the
Government, IDA and a number of foreign and local consultants, toward the
formulation of appropriate institutions, policies and control mechanisms for
tourism development in Bali. The establishment of the BTDB and the BTDC,
and the proposed project components of the Nusa Dua investment program, are
designed to assist in maximizing the net social benefits from tourism develop-
ment on Bali. The issues relating to tourist arrival numbers, their demons-
tration effect, the commercialization of the arts, tourist behavior, and the
distribution of benefits are essentially local issues--and they must be
resolved locally. Such is the mandate of the Bali Tourism Development Board,
and technical assistance is provided under the proposed project to aid in
this effort.V
5.38      The BTDC, in implementing the Nusa Dua investment program, would
be responsible for ensuring: (i) that local materials and Balinese labor
are employed to the maximum extent possible during construction, (ii) that
the artists who display their handicrafts, and the dancers and musicians who
perform at the Nusa Dua complex, represent as many villages as possible, and
that they receive an equitable share of the proceeds, and (iii) through the
hotel training school, that the Balinese workers will be suitably prepared
for the job opportunities generated by the resort investments.
5.39      In addition, the proposed technical and financial assistance to
the agricultural sector is designed to improve the share of tourism benefits
which remain in Indonesia, through reduced imports, and to improve the dis-
tribution of tourism benefits within Bali.
6. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. Financial Objectives
6.01      The basic financial objective which BTDC, the entity responsible
for operation of the Nusa Dua tourism estate and the water supply, sewerage
and waste disposal facilities, would be expected to achieve is the recovery
of its investments, including a reasonable rate of return, from charges to
the beneficiaries. The achievement of this objective is necessarily con-
ditioned by the ability of BTDC to charge the hotels with the full capital
1/ See Annex XII, paras. 20-23 and Annex VIII, para. 1.
2/ Including, for example, employment of a consultant anthropologist who
will make recommendations on the means by which the social impact of
tourism can be minimized (see para. 3.10).



- 28 -
and operating costs of infrastructure without endangering their profitability.
The expectation of a reasonanle level of profitability is, of course, a condi-
tion of initial investor interest and its achievement a prerequisite for
continued operation of hotels.
6.02      The charges to be made to the hotels and other commercial devel-
opers fall into three different categories:
(a) direct user charges by public utilities who are merely
extending their normal services to the resort area under
consumer contract> regulated by already established tariffs;
(b) direct user chargies to be established by BTDC for services
provided by its own utility division; and
(c) charges by BTDC for provision of other services and common
installations such as streetlighting, and leasing of hotel
sites and other properties, all of which would be levied
in the form of lease rents and annual service charges (or
be included in the purchase price of properties which might
be sold rather than Leased).
6.03      Charges in the first category would be those for electricity supply
and telephone services both of whiclh are established under national tariff
regulations consistent with the objective of ensuring the continuing finan-
cial viability of the public utiLity companies, PLN and Perumtel. Both
companies are beneficiaries of IDA credits for power and telecommunications
projects; their financial position has been analyzed in the context of these
projects and suitable arrangements for control of their financial performance
to achieve agreed financial objectives have been made (see IDA credits INS-165,
INS-334 and INS-210).
6.04      The charges to be established by BTDC for water supply, sewerage
and waste disposal services would be required to meet the objective of achiev-
ing annually a reasonable rate of return on gross fixed assets in operation
(see para. 6.14).
6.05      The charges to be levied by BTDC in the form of lease rents and
annual service charges, on the otheir hand, would be determined with a view
towards promoting the build-up of the hotel area and the ultimate recovery
of the investment, including a reasonable rate of return, which will require
a more flexible approach regarding the annual level of charges than that
applicable to BTDC's utility operations (see para. 6.07).
B. Financial Forecasts - Bali Tourism Development Corporation
6.06      The financial forecasts for BTDC have been made separately for each
of the two types of operations to reaflect the different,nature of the non-
utility tourism estate and hotel training center operations, on the one hand,
and of BTDC's utility operations, oni the other hand. Projections for non-
utility tourism estate and hotel school operations are included in Annex III,
Table 1. These projections indicate that despite some losses in the initial
years, BTDC would be able to achieve a rate of return of 8% on its gross
fixed investment in the non-utility tourism estate (including the hotel school)
by 1983, when the hotel development is expected to have reached the full



- 29 -
operating stage. By that time BTDC is expected to be able to generate suf-
ficient internal funds from its non-utility operations, including the hotel
school, to meet its debt service obligations for this part of the project.
6.07      These projections are based on a number of assumptions which are
listed in Annex III. Among these assumptions is an average annual land
lease price of US$353 per hotel room which is equivalent to about 2.8% of
the projected gross revenues of the hctels and is therefore considered to
be reasonable. Rents for commercial facilities have been assumed at an
average annual lease price of US$22 per square meter. Annual service
charges are estimated at US$250 per hotel room to cover theexpenses of
operating and maintaining non-utility infrastructure facilities at the Nusa
Dua resort. These annual service charges would amount to about 2% of the
expected gross hotel revenuesin a typical year and are likely to be feasible
from the operational aspects of both BTDC and potential hotels at Nusa Dua.
The various charges levied by the BTDC would be suitably adjusted for future
price level changes. Potential price level changes, however, are not re-
flected in the financial forecasts of the BTDC (see para. 6.12).
6.08      BTDC's operating costs cover maintenance of non-utility infra-
structure facilities in the resort complex, and promotional and administra-
tive activities for the resort.  The payroll costs are estimated on the
basis of staff requirements for operating non-utility components of the
estate, excluding the hotel school. The promotional expenses and adminis-
trative costs are based on proposed work programs to carry out tasks
adequately. The differences between the operating costs of the hotel school
and the revenues from pupils' fees is included as net operating cost of the
school.
6.09      The financial projections for BTDC's water supply, sewerage and
waste disposal operations, which are included in Annex IV, show that BTDC's
utility division would be able to achieve a rate of return of 14% and a debt
service coverage of 1.3 by 1983; these ratios would be satisfactory. They
are based on an assumed overall rate of Rps 225 per m3 of water consumption
for all services, which would be equivalent to about US$2.10 per day per
occupied hotel room.
6.10      Because of the gradual build up of hotels during the period 1978-
82 BTDC's utility division would not achieve equally satisfactory financial
results during the early years when the rate of return on gross fixed assets
would range from about 2.3% to 4.9%. One way to avoid this would be to
raise the starting rate for water supply, sewerage and waste disposal by
about 30% bringing it to the equivalent of about US$2.80 per day per occupied
hotel room. However, such a rate level is considered too high; it would
increase the daily cost of all utilities (including electricity) to more
than US$5.90 per occupied room during the promotional period. Since one of
BTDC's functions is the promotion of hotel development, the rather limited
initial losses to be incurred on its water and sewerage operations should
be regarded as promotional expenses.
6.11      The calculation of separate rates of return for non-utility and
utility operations is required for purposes of setting adequate user charges.
The financial results of the BTDC, however, should be assessed in terms of
a consolidated rate of return. Assuming a twenty-five-year operating period,



- 30 -
the consolidated DCF return would. be! about 8%.  Consoiidated financial state-
ments for BTDC as a whole are shcwn in Annex HII; they reveal thiat the results
from BTDC's overall operations would enable the company to maintain adequate
cash balances, after servicing its total long-term debt from 1980 onwards;
the debt service coverage would be 1.4 in 1983. At the same time the debt:
equity ratio would be 58:42 after temporarily reaching 60:40 in 1980 and 1981.
In view of the accumulated cash balaLncesforecast for 1983, on the order of
Rps 1.2 billion, accelerated repayment of Government advances would seem
possible, unless reinvestment of internal funds for expansion of facilities
for a second stage project would be required.
6.12      The financial results of E,TDC, which can be considered as satis-
factory under these circumstances, rould necessarily be subject to the suc-
cessful development of the hotel complex as now assumed. From a purely
financial point of view the propcortion of borrowed funds invested would
give BTDC an advantage in that any rise in the price level would result in
an increased cash flow while debt: service payments would remaitn constant.
With the exception of the summary financing plans, which are expressed in
terms of estimated current price levels, the financial forecasts are expressed
in terms of constant prices and t:herefore do not reflect this potential addi-
tional margin of net cash flow available for debt service. Similarly, the
use of constant prices in the financial projections results in a more con-
servative estimate of the debt:equity ratio. The possible effect on BTDC
of any slowdown in hotel development: because of a more severe impact of the
energy crisis than assumed in the basic projections should be viewed in this
context.
6.13      A possible slower build-up of the hotel complex which is discussed
in detail in Annex IX and para. 5.12, would cause BTDC to incur in the worst
case a maximum loss of about Rps 800 million in 1980 and in the best case a
maximum loss of about Rps 500 million; in each case BTDC would, however,
recover to a position of modest profits by the time of full development of
tne hotel complex.  The financing requirements which would result from the
shortfalls in internal cash generated would be relatively short-term and would
even in the worst case not exceed about Rps 900 million and therefore would
be manageable. BTDC would be somewhat flexible in adjusting its policies
to varying market conditions in that it could exercise a lease-sale policy
as explained in Annex III, para. 10, which would give it the benefit of pre-
payment of lease rents under 30-year contracts. This would improve its
financial position, which can therefore be considered as reasonably sound
even under less favorable market conditions than those assumed to be most
likely.
C. Financial Covenants
6.14      To ensure that BTDC's utility income would cover operating expenses
(including adequate depreciation) and produce a reasonable rate of return,
BTDC would be required to establish and maintain its tariffs for water supply,
sewerage and waste disposal at levels which would allow the Utilities Division
to earn an overall rate of return on gross fixed assets in operation., suitably
adjusted for price level changes, of at least ll7o by the time the estate hotels
are in full operation. The BTDC would review these tariffs annually, in terms
of both their adequacy and their appropriateness at projected levels of water
consumption, and would inform the Association about the results of such reviews.



- 31 -
It was agreed during negotiations that the rate oL return should be express-
ed in terms of gross fixed assets because, in the case of such a relatively
self-contained project, the absence of continuing reinvestment in new facil-
ities would erode the controlling effect of a formula based on net fixed as-
sets: in effect, the constantly decreasing balance of net assets would re-
quire less and less revenue to achieve the stipulated percentage rate of re-
turn.
6.15      Because of the nature of BTDC's non-utility operations, their finan-
cial projections (paras. 6.06-6.08) do not represent standards of performance
which can be regulated by financial covenants such as a rate of return require-
ment. During negotiations, therefore, agreement was reached that the BTDC,
with the assistance of the advisors referred to in para. 3.14 would formulate
a statement of its objectives and lease policies and proposed model lease
forms, and submit these to the Association for its concurrence not later than
December 31, 1974.
6.16      To safeguard its financial position, BTDC would also be required
not to incur any debt, without the Association's approval, until 1985 other
than that incurred to finance the project under its loan agreement with the
Government.
6.17      BTDC would be required to establish, with the assistance of consult-
ants acceptable to the Association, a system of commercial accounts to be
maintained by an accounting section suitably staffed and to be audited annually
by independent auditors acceptable to the Association. Audited financial
statements wTould be submitted to the Association within four months after the
end of each fiscal year under audit.

Notes -6o Cost Estimate Tables
1. General Cost Estimates
The total project cost has been estimated at US$36.1 million.
As contingency allowances, about 7.9% of the total project cost--or
15.0% of the cost of civil works and equipmerIt--has been added for physi-
cal increase. This is reasonablea b,ecause most of the cost estimates were
based on semi-detailed engineerLing studies ani on cost data for similar
work.  About 22.0% of the total project cost--or 41.9% of the cost of
civil works and equipment has been envisaged for price increases based
on projections of likely price level changes during the construction
period.  Total contingency allowances constitute about 30% of the total
project cost.
2. Detailed Cost Estimates
Tables 2.1 to 2.15'contain detailed information on base costs
and cost of land acquisition of the project components. This informa-
tion has been organized into amounts corresponding to civil works,
equipment, foreign exchange componeiat and annual allocations in accor-
dance with the schedule of implementation.

APPRAISAL OF THE BALI TOURISM PROJECT
THE BALI TOURISM DEVELOPMENT BOARD
1.        Growing concern that the uncontrolled expansion of Bali's tour-
iorf industry might have damaging environmental, social and economic con-
sequences led to the endorsement of a tourism development master plan by
the Indonesian Government in 1971. The plan had been devised by the
French consultancy firm Sceto under a UNDP financed project for which
the Bank acted as executing agency. The plan includes specific recom-
mendations for the physical development of tourist accommodation and
the protection of cultural and scenic assets. It also contains some
suggestions for possible arrangements needed for the implementation of
the master plan.
2.        Presidential Decree No. 26 of March 29, 1972 established the
institutional framework for the development of tourism on Bali in accor-
dance with the master plan by creating the Bali Tourism Development Board
(BTDB). The functions of the BTDB include: (i) creating the necessary
links between government agencies, private tourist enterprises and
Balinese community organizations; (ii) coordinating tourism sector ac-
tivities so as to maximize net benefits and minimize social and environ-
mental deterioration; and (iii) advising various Provincial Government
agencies on the practical application of the master plan.
3.        To facilitate these functions, the Board is composed of 12 mem-
bers representing the various federal and regional government agencies,
with the Governor of Bali as Chairman and a representative of the National
Directorate of Tourism as Vice-Chairman_/. The Director of the local
tourism office would serve as Executiye Secretary heading a secretariat
which would consist of a physical planner, a sociologist, an economist
and an expert in culture and religion, all of whom are expected to be
Balinese.
4.        Prior to the formulation of an island-wide tourism development
master plan and the establishment of the BTDB, there was a lack of gov-
ernment policy and action in controlling and coordinating the development
of tourism. Furthermore, a link was missing between government agencies,
Balinese communities, tourists and private tourist enterprises. A num-
ber of adverse social consequences ensued: private hotels, travel agen-
cies, shopkeepers and taxi drivers began to play a major role in organizing
1/ The members of the Board besides the Chairman and Vice-Chairman are the
heads of the Agricultural, Power & Works, Customs Tax, Immigration,
Education and Industrial Services, representatives of the Armed Forces
and the Bank of Indonesia as well as a Secretary, appointed by the
Governor.

performances by Balinese dancers and artists as well as in the productiori
and sale of objects of art produced by local craftsmen.  They made high
profits by playing traditional village organizations out against each
other, which left the actual performers, artists, and craftsmaen with
less than their fair share of "he proceeds from the sale of their cul-
tural products and services.
5.        Recently there has been an increasing awareness on the part
of the Government that the improvement of the links between government
agencies, Balinese communities, tourists and private tourist enter-
prises is vital to the successful participation of the Balinese popu-
lation in the economic growth of the island, and of importance for the
effective implementation and administration of the Bali tourism master
plan. It is one of the BTDB's pr-Lme aims to improve these links. Since
the present governmental struct-ure does not grow out of the traditional
Balinese village organizations, however, this will be a difficult task.
Recognizing this fact, the Government has requested that technical as-
sistance be made available to ]3TDB. Steps are currently under way to
secure the services of a sociologist/anthropologist familiar with social
and cultural problems in Bali, and with the potential impact of tourism,
to serve as consultant to the Board for relatively short periods total-
ling about nine months over the next three years.
6.        The implementation and administration of the tourism develop-
ment master plan require that the BTDB, through its secretariat, ini-
tiate and coordinate a multitudle of actions in the field of urban and
regiona:. planning, including the cdevelopment of long range planning
policies, the introduction and administration of appropriate planning
legislation and the enforcement of development controls.  These tasks,
however, exceed the present capabi lty of the provincial planning office,
the agency primarily responsib-Le for the implementation of the physical
aspects of the tourism development; master plan. The Indonesian authori-
ties have therefore endorsed the proposal that a planning advisor be
assigned for a period of three years to the BTDB secretariat. This ad-
visor would guide and train the BTDB planner and the provincial planning
office staff in comprehensive area planning, including land use and
regional planning, as well as tohe formulation and administration of ap-
propriate planning legislation.
7.        During negotiations, assurances were obtained that adequate
budgetary funds would be made available to the BTDB as required. It is
expected that the members of the secretariat would be employed by
May 31, 1974, and that the two advisors referred to above would be ap-
pointed by September 30, 1974.

APPRAISAL OF THE BALI TOURISM PROJECT
THE BALI TOURISM DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION (BTDC)
A. Legal Status
L.      The Bali Tourism Development Corporation (BTDC) was established by
presidential decree on November 11, 1973, and its charter legalized before a
Notary Public on November 12, 1973.  The BTDC is a limited liability corpora-
tion or P.T. (Perseroan Terbatas) with the Indonesian Government as its only
shareholder.
B. Development Objectives
Operating as an estate management corporation, the BTDCts major
objective will be to create a successful tourism estate on the Bukit Peninsula.
To achieve this objective, it will:
(i) supervise planning and execution of the project;
(ii) devise and carry out a land policy designed to attract
private investors qualified to provide tourist accommodation
and other facilities compatible with projected tourist
demand;
(iii) maintain, operate and administer infrastructure facilities
as well as common buildings and areas within the Nusa Dua
tourism estate;
(iv) recover through adequate charges to the beneficiaries the
capital and operating costs of services provided to them;
(v) guide private development activities through the applica-
tion of appropriate coiltrols;
(vi) administer hotel employee training programs and regulate
the employment policies of individual hotel operators;
(vii) contribute to the welfare of the local community through
advice and assistance to the BTDB on matters of common
concern.
3.      During the early operational stages of the project which overlap
with the construction phase, the BTDC would apply a land policy focused on
the leasing of land and common facilities to hotel investors and commercial
tenants. Depending upon market demand and the financial situation of the
corporation, a land policy might be considered for the later stages of
operation, which would include lease-sale u/of properties.
1/ The leaa -sale of land on the estate would confer on the purchasing
investor only the right to use the land, including erecting buildings,
for a period of 30 years. In effect, the purchase would be a prepaid
30-year lease which could be extended for additional periods by mutual
agreement.



ANNEX III
Page 2
4.      BTDC would bear the overall responsibility for the provision of
adequate and efficient infrastructuare services to the Nusa Dua estate and
for adequate mainntenance of common areas and buildings.  Direct responsi-
bility for operation, maintenance and administration of the water and
sewerage system, solid waste disposal, internal roads and streets, landscaped
common areas and buildings would be w:ith BTDC, whilst PLN would be responsi-
ble for the electrical supply system, including primary distribution.
Responsibility for operation, maintenance and administration of the tele-
communication system would be with Perumtel, and with Bina Marga for the access
road.
5.      Besides the income from lease rents and eventual lease-sales, BTDC
would obtain revenues mainly from annual service charges to hotels and from
utility charges for water supply, sewerage and waste disposal services to
consumers (hotels, shops, etc.) with:L  the resort complex (Annex IV).  It
will be BTDC's responsibility to ensure that such charges are established and
adjusted in line with operating costs and at a level which would ensure a
reasonable rate of return on the investment.
6.      BTDC would guide private cLevelopment activities and operations through
covenants in lease agreements and lease-sale contracts. Such lease agree-
ments would be designed to ensure adherence to the proposed tourism estate
master plan and to constrain, to the extent practicable, the freedom of es-
tate occupants to transfer lease-sale properties. Covenants would include,
but would not be limited to the following conditions:
(i) minimum investment requirements and construction time
limitations;
(ii) cmnditions for subleasing properties and buildings;
(iii) land use standards and regulations concerned with construction
procedures and environmental protection during operation;
(iv) architectural and landscaping standards to control the use of
building materials, the bulk and external appearance of
structures, and the quality level of green areas;
(v)  specific site restrictions, establishing densities, height
limitations, setbacks, easements and access rights; and
(vi) requirements and conditions regarding contributions to be
made by hotel investors to the employee training program.
7.      The Balinese are deeply rooted in their cultural and social environ-
ment and past experience has shown that it would be highly undesirable to
encourage them to leave their traditional village societies. Within the Nusa
Dua estate, therefore, the provision for housing facilities for hotel employees
will be kept to a minimum, and public transportation between Nusa Dua and the



ANNEX III
Page 3
villlages would be provided instead. BTDC would carry out a study of trans-
portation requirements as part of final design and submit its recommendations
to the Association not later than December 31, 1974.
8.      Finally, the BTDC would assume an important role in the overall
development of tourism in Bali through the operation of a hotel employee
training center (Annex VII) and by assisting the Bali Tourism Development
Board in the implementation of the Bali Tourism Master Plan (Annex II). The
cooperative efforts of the BTDB and BTDC will be directed towards:
(i) the development and strengthening of links between the
local village conmuities, the government and the various
tourist organizations;
(ii) initiating and coordinating art exhibitions and cultural
performances;
(iii)  setting up means for controlling the quality of dances and
other artistic performances and devising practical methods
to ensure a fairer sharing of the receipts between the
promoters and the performers; and
(iv) initiating and coordinating tourist activities, such as
excursions, sightseeing tours and special events.
Co Management Aspects
9.      The activities of the corporation will be guided by a board of
supervisors (Devan Komisaris). The supervisory board is to be composed of
the Secretary General of Pablic Work, the Director General of Monetary Affairs
(Dept. of Finance), and the Governor of Bali, with the Director General of
Tourism as Chairman. The proposed composition of the Board of Supervisors
should facilitate cooperation between BTDC and other public sector entities
involved in implementation of the tourism estate.
'L0.    The corporation will be administered by a Board of Directors which is
composed of the President Director and the heads of the technical operations
and finance divisions. Mhr. Soetomo, who has had considerable experience in
supervising the implementation of various projects and who has recently held
the position of Inspector General of the Ministry of Communications, was
appointed to the post of President Director in November 1973. In February 1974,
the appointment of the Directors of Technical Operations and Finance was confirmed.
D. Organization for Execution
11.     With the exception of the Bali based hotel school-division, the BTDC
management group including the technical operations and finance divisions as
'well as a secretariat wvuld be headquartered in Jakarta during the execution
phase. Besides the members of the Board of Directors, the staff includes so
far the Secretary to the President Director, a lawyer, an architectural-engineer-
ing assistant to the Director of Technical Operations, and a public relations
officer. To complete the staffing of the finance and administration division,
accountants, a financial analyst, and a number of administrative assistants
will be appointed in the near future.



Annex III
Page-E;
L2.     In order to supe.rviSe final planning and execution of the project,
the BTDC would establish a technical field unit in Bail which would operate
under the supervision of the Director, Technic6l Operations. The field
unit would be headed by an experienced engineer and would be staffed by
;hree engineers, an architect, an accountant, a procurement officer, a
real estate specialist, two surveyors and a laboratory technician.
13.     Besides having overall responsibiiity for coordinatirng the activi-
ties of the various agencies such as Bina Marga, Perumtel and PLN, involved
in the implementation of the project, the BTDC will be directly responsible
for the construction of the water supply and sewerage system, internal roads
and streets, all common buildings and landscaped areas, and the hotel train-
ing school near Denpasar. Consultants acceptable to the Association would
carry out the final designs of all project components.
1i.     Given the complex nature of the project, it was agreed during nego-
tiations that, by December 31, 197L, a critical path network acceptable to
the Association would be prepared for carrying out all parts of the project;
it would be reviewed internally at least every three months by all parties
concerned, and the results of such reviews would be communicated to the
Association every six months.
E. Organization for Operation
15.     Shortly before the project becomes operational, the headquarters
staff would be relocated from Jakarta to Bali.  The finance division would
continue to be concerned with finance, accounting and general administra-
tion, but would be given additional responsibilities in the fields of
property management and lease adrini-stration. For the operation of the
hotel school, BTDC would employ the services of four full time senior
teachers and would operate and adminrfister the school in close cooperation
with the hotel industry and the Provrincial Tourism Office.  The operating
program would be based on curricula, staffing patterns and criteria for
the selection of trainees, as proposed by the ILO (Annex VII).  Organiza-
tion and staffing of the technicELl operations division's field unit would
be modified in accordance with its new responsibility to operate, adminis-
ter and maintain BTDC owned infrastructure and properties. For this pur-
pose, it would form three sectior.s concerned with: operation and adminis-
tration of the water and sewer system; the maintenance of roads, land-
scape(d areas and buildings; and environmental sanitation.
F. Technical Assistance
1&.    1Because of their lack of experience in i-mplementing and adminis-
tering integrated tourism estate projects, the Indonesian authorities
have requested that the BTDC staff be assisted by consultants during the
execution phase of the project. During negotiations, agreement was
reached on the following advisory positions: (i) an expert on tourism-
related land development and the hotel industry who would assist in the
formulation of corporate objectives, lease policies and model lease forms;
(ii) a financial expert who would advise on general financial policy and
assist in the analysis of investment proposals from hotel and other commercial



Annex III
Page 5
developers; and (iii) an engineering expert who would assist the Director
of Technical Operations in the review of project design and bid evaluations
and advise the head of the field unit on construction management. One of
the major tasks of these advisors will be to provide the Indonesian Team
with on-the-job training. Terms of reference for the three advisors were
agreed upon during negotiations.
17.     The advisor on corporate objectives and lease policies would be
employed for short-term assignments totalling about nine months over a
three year period. His appointment would be a condition of effectiveness
of the proposed credit. The financial advisor would be employed full
time for three years, and the engineerinig advisor full time for four years.
In addition to these individual consultants, the project provides for short-
term technical assistance from an accounting firm which would assist in
the establishment of a commercial accounting system.
18.     During negotiations it was agreed:  (i) that the appointment of
these consultants would be subject to approval by the Association; (ii)
that the BTDC would submit to the Association for its approval, by
December 31, 1974, a statement of corporate objectives and lease pclicies
and proposed model lease forms; and (iii) that, by December 31, 1975, the
BTDC would prepare and submit to the Association a detailed organization
plan, including staff requirements, for operation of the estate.
G. Financial Aspects
Financial Objectives
19.     The basic financial objective which BTDC would be expected to
achieve is the recovery of its investments, including a reasonable rate
of return, from charges to the beneficiaries. The charges fall into
three different categories:
(i)  direct user charges by public utilities who are merely ex-
tending their normal services to the resort area under con-
sumer contracts regulated by already established tariffs;
(ii)  direct user charges to be established by BTDC for services
provided by its own utility division; and
(iii)  charges by BTDC for provision of other services, use of common
space and facilities, leasing of hotel sites and other pro-
perties, all of which would be levied in the form of lease
rents and annual service charges.

Financial Forecasts
20.    The financial forecasts for BTDC have been made separately for each
of the two types of operations to reflect the different nature of the tourism
estate non-utility services and hotel school component, on the one hand, and of
the utility operatios on the othe:r hand. Forecasts for the utility operations
are included in Annex IV, Tables 1 and 2.
Financing Plan - Tourism Estate Non-Utilities Services Component and Hotel School
21.     The financing plan for the tourism estate non-utilities services component,
including the hotel school, can be summarized as follows:
Millions of
Rps.           US$
Requirements
Land Acquisition                        420             1.01
Internal Roads & Street                  496            1.20

Amenity Core & Comm. Facilities         962             2.32
Bualu/Benoa Renewal                     115             0.28
Hotel School                             474            1.14
Project Administration                  249             0.60
Technical Assistance                    249             0.60
Total Capital Expenditures            5,418            13.05
Working Capital                          25             0.06
Deferred Interest                     1,262             3.04
1,287            3.10
Total Requirements                    ,S,705           16.15

Interna:l Cash Generation                 4               -
Gov't Equity Contribution             3,487             8.37
Proceeds of IDA Credit                1,995             4.80
Gov't Advances                        1,219             2.98
Total Sources of Funds                  6,705            16.15
The construction cost estimates and the equity contribution contain an amount
of Rps. 411 million each, which reflects the recent change of cost estimates
to take into account latest estimates of price level changes through the end
of the construction period. The summary financing plan is thus expressed in
current prices rather than in constant prices which have been used for the
detailed financial tables.



ANNEX III
Page 7
22.    The Government contribution would be made available to BTDC as
equity, while the proceeds of the IDA credit would be passed on to BTDC
in the form of a long-term loan at 12% interest with 24 years repayment
after six years grace. Interest on the proceeds of the IDA Credit accruing
during the 6 year grace period and totalling Rps. 1,262 million has been
treated as an advance to be repaid by BTDC to the Government from the
seventh year over a period of 15 years in annual installments of Rps. 84
million.
Financial Results - Tourism Estate Non-Utility Component and Hotel School
23.     The financial projections for BTDC's non-utility operations, including
the hotel school, are based on a number of assumptions which are listed in the
notes to the financial tables (Tables 1 and 2). The projections indicate that
despite some losses in the initial years, BTDC would be able to achieve a rate
of return of about 8% on its gross fixed assets in the tourism estate (including
the hotil sc6iooIJ when thei hotel development is expected to have reached the
full operating stage in 1983. By this time BTDC is expected to be able to
generate sufficient internal funds from its non-utility operations, including
the hotel school, to meet its debt service obligations for this part of the
project and to retain adequate reserve funds. The debt service coverage
ehown in the cash flow projections is quite satisfactory at 1.5 in a typical
Year.
H. Consolidated FinaUicing Plan and Financial Position
24.     The consolidated financing plan (1974-1979) for BTDC including non-utility
operations, hotel school and utility operations can be summarized as follows:
Millions of
Sources of Funds               Rp_        US
Internal cash generation        232        o.6
Gov't. equity contribution   4,969        11.9
Gov't. advances               2,339        5.6
Proceeds of IDA Credit        4,05L        9.8
Total sources of funds       11,594       27.9
Application of Funds
Capital expenditures:
Utility component           3,509        8.5
Tourism estate component   4,944        11.9
Hotel school component        474        1.1
8,927       21.5
Working capital & cash        285        0.7
Deferred interest           2,382        5.7
Total application of funds  11,594        27.9



Annex III
Page 8
25.       To provide the funas required for the project, the Government
would make successive increases in BTDC's capital, now authorized to be
Hps. o00 million, to reach a level of about Rps. 5,000 million.  In addi-
tion, working capital and accrued interest would be financed by Govern-
ment advances amounting to Rps. 2,339 million. During negotiations,
ag'reement was reached that these funds would be made available to BTDC
as requlred.
26.       Detailed consolidated financial statements for BTDC are attached
(Table 3). These statements indicate that BTDC's overall financial posi-
tion would be satisfactory. The proposed financing arrangements would
allow BTDC to maintain a debt service coverage ranging from .8 in 1980 to
1.4 in 1983. The rate of return an averaLge consolidated gross fixed
assets in operation would gradually increase from 2.5% in 1978 to 9.1%
in 1983.  Assuming a 25-year operating period, the consolidated DCF rate
of return would be 7.8%.
27.       Because BTDC would not immediately require internal funds for
expansion of facilities after the hotel development comes into full opera-
uion by 1983, the free internal funds accumulated by that time would
amount to about Rps. 1.2 billion. Available cash could be used to accel-
erate repayment of Government advaaces which have been assumed otherwise
to have a scheduled repayment period of about 15 years.
Financial Covenants
28.       Because of the nature of BTDC's non-utility operations, the
financial projections for these operations (paras. 20 and 23) do not
represent standards of performance which can be regulated by financial
covenantus such as a rate of return requirement. During negotiations,
agreement was therefore reached that BTDC would formulate, in agreement
with the Association, financial objectives and regulations governing
lease rents, sales prices and service charges.  The financial covenants
covering BTDC's utility operations are included in Annex IV.
29.       The accounting system, to be established with the assistance
of consultants (referred to in para. 17 above), would be maintained by
an accounting section suitably staffed, and audited annually by indepen-
dent auditors acceptable to the Association. Audited financial state-
ments would be submitted to the Association within four months after
the end of each fiscal year under audit.
0O.      To further safeguard its financial position, BTDC would be re-
quired not to incur any debt, without the Association's approval, until
1985 other than that incurred to finance the project under its loan
agreement with the Government.

NOTE TO FINANCIAL TABLES
BTDC - Tourism Estate Components and Hotel School
Assumptions for Financial Projections
5i.       Revenue projections for the leasing of land assume an average
annual land lease price of US$353 Der hotel room. This represents about
2.8% of the projected hotel gross revenues in a typical year and is con-
sidered reasonable.
32.       Rents for commercial and recreational facilities in the central
core area have been assumed at an annual average of US$22 per square
meter for a total of approximately 3,000 square meters of rentable space.
33.       Annual service charges to cover the cost of maintenance and re-
pair services as provided by BTDC for common areas and facilities are es-
timated at US$250 per hotel room.  In a typical year, such charges would
amount to approximately 2% of the projected hotel gross revenues and are
expected to be acceptable to potential hotel operations in Nusa Dua.
34.       The annual average maintenance costs for common areas and facil-
ities have been estimated at Rps. 39 million or 2% of the total cost of
relevant project components. Total promotional expenses for the initial
years have been established at Rps. 36 million.  The estimated administra-
tive costs have been based on an annual average of Rps. 33 million, repre-
senting 5% of the projected gross revenues from land leases, rents and
service charges during a typical year of operation. Average annual payroll
costs per local employee have been estimated at $2,900.
35.       It is expected that the annual enrollment at the hotel school
would average 400 to 450 pupils (Annex VII). With an estimated annual
tuition fee of US$50 per pupil, the annual revenues from pupil's fees
would total approximately US$20,000. Total operating costs before capital
expenditures have tentatively been estimated at US$70,000. Since it is
expected that BTDC would be in a financial position to cover the resulting
operational deficits from revenues generated by land leases, rents and
service charges, the deficits have been treated as annual net operating
costs in the operating projections.
36.       It has been assumed that hotel school operations would begin in
1976 or one year prior to BTDC being in a revenue earning position. The
required initial working capital of US$60,000 for the first year of opera-
tion would be made available to BTDC as a government equity contribution.
37.       Depreciation is estimated at a rate of 3.3% per annum for civil
works facilities and 20% per annum for equipment of the relevant project
components, with the exception of equipment for electric installations
which is depreciated at a rate of 4% per annum.



Annex III
Page 10
78.       Costs for project administration and technical assistance fees
during construction are assumed to be depreciated as part of the assets
over a 25-year period from the first year of operation.  In addition,
accrued interest on the proceeds of the IDA Credit for the first six years
is also assumed to be amortized over a 15-year period from the third year
of operation.

ANNEXZ IV
INDONE43IA
APPRAISAL OF THE      TOURISM  PROJECT
WATER SJPPLY, SEWERAGE AND WASTE DISPOSAL COONEWN
A. Scope of the Project
1.      The Project would provide facilities to meet mainly the water demand
of the future hotels and other superstructures in the Nusa Dua resort area,
and to ensure adequate severage and waste disposal service within the resort
area. In addition, the water supply facilities would allow provision of
piped water through community outlets to two villages (Benoa and Bualu) in
the vicinity of the resort area, which presently do not have safe and depend-
able water supply.
2.      Extensive groundwater exploration was carried out by competent
specialists to ascertain the availability of adequate and appropriate water
resources and to establish a firm basis for detailed engineering of the water
supply component.
B. Description of the Project
3.      The Bukit Peninsula, where the Nusa Dua resort area would be developed,
has no surface water resources. The area is very much drier than the Bali
mainland and consists essentially of an upfaulted block of tertiary limestone.
At present villagers obtain water from shallow wells in the coastal areas or
from surface reservoirs, which are filled during the wet season and thus
only provide an intermittent source of supply.
4.        Exploratory drilling has been carried out in 1973 by a firm of
Australian consulting engineers financed partly by the Government and partly
from the third IDA Technical Assistance Credit (IDA-INS). Based on the results
of this exploration work the water source would be developed to yield 135 1/s
of raw water from e4ght boreholes 200 mm in diameter. For pumping deep well
pumps, each with a suitable capacity would be installed.
5.      The yield from the proven groundwater resources is considered to be
adequate to meet the projected water consumption of the planned hotels and the
adjacent villages, together estimated to be about average 123 l/s by 1983.
6.      The water tests carried out in the Bukit Peninsula indicate that
with softening the water quality would be quite satisfactory and meet WHO
standards. A treatment plant would be required and provision has been made
in the cost estimates with a basic amount of US$ 1.0 million equivalent. The
final design would be subject to review by the Association.
7.      For balancing the fluctuations in production and consumption and for
providing certain storage, a service reservoir of approximately 6,500 m3
capacity would be constructed, representing about one half day's supply on a
maximum day or 16 hours supply on average day.
8.      Distribution and reticulation mains for the resort area and to the
villages of Bualu and Benoa would range from 18 in. to 1 in. in size. It is
proposed to use asbestos cement pipes for the large pipes and PVC in the
smaller sizes.

9.      The topography of the projeict area is fairly flat and the ground
level is generally only slightly above sea level.  Soil consists mainly of
sand &nd linestone gravel.  The grcundlwater table is at a depth of approxi-
m.ately 2 to 3 meters.
10.    The sewage from the tourism area would be discharged into oxidation
ponds by a system of concrete and FVC pipelines of various diameters. In
order to maintain an acceptable grade of the main sever and to avoid excessive
depth of sewer lines one intermediate pumping station and one lift station at
the end of the main sever would be recqired.  Sewage from hotels may have to
be pumped up to the main sewer by individual pumping stations to be provided
by the hotel developers depending cn the hotel planning.  The oxidation ponds
are proposed to be located at the shoreline of the inland bay between the
resort area and the village of Benca. The surface area would be approximate-
ly 5.5 ha., the detention time 20 days and the BOD5 of the effluent is expected
to be 20 mg/'. The effluent would be discharged into the internal bay, where
no adverse environmental effect is expected because of the degree of treatment
prior to discharge.
Landscape Irrigation
11I     The plant nursery and the improvement of existing plantation in the
resort area require the provision of an irrigation system as there is only
little surface water during the dry season. The water demand has been
estimated by the consultants at 1,200 m3 day.
12.     Water for landscape irrigation would be obtained from two deep wells
to be constructed within the nursery. Well pumps (capacity 7.5 1/sec), a
reservoir of 375 m3 and an elevated tank of 30 m3 capacity would be installed.
A distribution system consisting of asbestos cement pipes and of PVC pipes
would be provided.
Solid Waste Disposal
13.     Based on experience of large international hotels the quantity of
waste from tuP to 3000 hotel rooms is estimated to be approximately 30 tons per
day. The disposal area required for about 10 years operation is estimated
at 60o,00 m2.
14.     The sanitary landfill methodl has been found to be the least cost
solution for the disposal of solid waste. An area located on the shore of the
inland bay between Kuta and Tuban airport, just outside Bukit Peninsula, has
been selected for this purpose.  The site is presently subject to occasiona.
flooding and therefore not being utilized at all.  In order to prevent pollution
of the bay an earth embankment wol4ld enclose the site and the construction of
a short access road would facilitate easy accessibility from the ma;n road.
15.     A small bulldozer would be provided for the flattening and compacting
of the waste and the spreading of earth layers to prevent the breeding of
insects and other pests.  For the collection of solid waste refuse trucks of
7 m3 capacity and dirp trucks -ould be used.



ANNEX IV
Page 3
C. Cost Estimates
16.     The estimated costs of the water supply, sewerage, irrigation and
solid waste disposal components are summarized in Annex I, Tables 2.1, 2.2,
2.3 and 2.4. Costs are based on Indonesian cost of goods and civil works
of similar nature. A physical contingency of 15% has been allowed for; the price
contingency is based on projected price level charges during the construction period.
D. Procurement and Execution of the Project
17.     All cmntracts for the supply of equipment and vehicles would be
subject to international competitive bidding. Small civil works contracts, i.e.
for the construction of the solid waste Ceisposal site, are unlikely to attract
international bidding. It is therefore proposed that for those contracts
only national competitive bidding be required.
18.     BTDC, with the assistance of qualified consultants, would be
responsible for the implementation and, after completion, for the operation of
the project.
E.  Organizational and Acdinistrative Aspects
199.    BTDC would establish a utility section which would be responsible for
operation of the facilities to serve the resort area and the two small villages.
This section would be staffed with competent specialists dealing with all
tec:hnical, financial and administrative aspects of the operations. The manage-
ment of the utility section would be guided by general policies designed to
assure reliable water supply, sewerage and waste disposal services and continuing
financial viability of the utility division. A commercial system of accounts
would be established with the asststance of qualified consultants acceptable to
the Association. These accounts would be maintained within the framework of the
accounting system to be establish6d for BTDC as a whole (see Annex III).
20.,    BTDC would be required to obtain such outside professional assistance
as may be needed to establish the utility section and train local staff to
assume full responsibility at the operational stage.
F. Financial Aspects
Financing Plan
21.     The financing plan (1974-79) for the water supply, sewerage and waste
disposal project can be summarized as follows:

Government contribution    2602.4-            6.4
Total sources of fumds  h,889.4           11.9
22.       The construction cost estimaLtes and the equity contribution contain an
amount of Rps. 367.4 million each which reflects the recent change of cost
estimates to take into account latest estimates of price level changes through the
end of the construction period. The summary financing plan is thus expressed in
current prices rather than constant, prices which have been used for the detailed
financial tables.
23.       The Government contribution would be made available to BTDC as equity,
except that interest at the rate of 12% on the proceeds of the IDA Credit w4ould be
financed and accrued as ar, advance during the first six years to be paid back to
the Government from the seventh year over a period of about fifteen years il
annual installments of Rps. 70 million. The proceeds of the IDA credit, would be
relent to BTDC at 12% with 6 years' interest deferred as above and repayment of
principal over 24 years after 6 years' grace.
Fature Financial Results
24.       A projection of the financial results of BTDC's utility operations (see
tables 1 and 2) indicates that services could be provided to the Nusa Dua resort,
area at acceptable utility rates which should at the time of full development of
the resort area provide a satisfactory rate of return of up to 1a< on gross fixed
assets in operation and adequate debt service coverage. The financial projections
are based on a number of assumptions (see Notes to Tables 1-2), among them n(st
importantly a water rate of Rps. 150 per m3 and a severage rate of Rps 75 per -n-
for the hotel area, being equivalent, to a total charge of US$ 2.15 or tess per
occupied hotel room from 1982 onwards.



!N!X IV
P,;ge 5
250       It is apparent, however, that BIDC's utility division would not achieve
equally satisfactor.y financial results during the early years of gradual build-up
of hotels in the Nusa Dua area. For the first two years rates of return would
range from 2.3% to 4.9%. During 1980-82 losses would be incurred, since current
interest on the proceeds of the DA credit could not be covered by net operating
revrenue.
26.,      These losses could only be avoided if the starting rate for water
supply, sewerage and waste disposal -waould be increased by 30% to lps. 290 per mr
of water.  This would be equivalent to US$ 2.80 per day per occupied hotei roomll
which is considered relatively high, considering the fact that in addition about
US$ 3.10 would be charged for electricity.  A daily cost of util7t,ies of US&v f5.90
per occupied room during the promotional period is not conducive to the desirable
rapid build-up of the hotel complex. Since BTDC's function is the promotion of
hotel development, the initial losses to be inculrred on its -water and sew,erage
0Perations, should therefore be regarded as promotional expenses.
Financial Covenants
27.       The financial performance of the BTDC Utility Section would be controlled
by a financial covenant which would requi-e BTDC to establish, maintain and collect
for each fiscal year water supply, sewerage and waste disposal tariffs calculated
to produce 11% rate of return on gross fixed assets, suitably adjustecd for changes
in price levels, at a time when water production has reached 2,600,OO0  c7ubic meters
per annum. The covenant is expressed in terms of gross fixed asset,s to avoid a
distortion of the percentage during periods when no new assets or replacarrien',s arc
required because of the relatively self-containmed nature of this project component.
28.       The continuing financial viability of BTDC, including the Utility
S;ection, would be dependent upon the results of its overall operation-s, which
are discussed in detail in Annex III. Under these circumstances t is not
considered appropriate to ccatrol part of BTDC's cperations by a separate debt
service or debt limitations covenant, other than by the requirement that PDeOC, incs;-
no debt -,:Lthout the Association's approval except ,hat pertainng to the execa-,ioa
of the proposed tourism project.

ASSUUPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
Generaal
I.        The  '.fnancial pro ,ect-ons for BTDC  s Utility Section are based on the
general assurption that this section would be responsible for construction and
operation of all water supply, sewerage and waste disposal facilities, including
t.l:e pro dis-io o. of water for purposes of lan.dscape irrigation.  Forecasts are
expressed in terms ot constant prices (base year 1973), except for a modest adjust--
ment of construction costs to reflect. normal price escalation between the base vear
and the year of actual expenditiure.  The latest estimate of inflationary increases
expected is not reflected in these statements (see also para. 22).
Cash Flow
2.        It has been agreed that Government contributions to BIDC would be made
in the form of equity, except that interest at the rate of 12% on the proceeds of
the IDA Credit, accrued during the first six years, woald be added to the Govern-
ment contribution in lieu of ixmediate payment by BTD5, and annual repayments of
Rps. 70 million wo-uld be made by BTDC from 1980 onwards for a period of about
thirteen years.
3j        It has beern agreed that the proceeds of the IDA Credit would be passed
on to BTDC at 12% interest, 30 years' repayment including 6 years! grace.  Interest
during the first six years would be financed by adding it to the Government
contribution (see para* 2).
4.        Working capital requirements have been calculated as roughly one-fourth
of annual billing.
Income Statements
5e        The water consumption of the hotels, which constitutes the main water use,
has been es+timated on the basis of the projected number of guest days (using an
-aerage 1.5 occuWpancy per zroom at estimated annual occupancy rates from 55% to 7"5,.

These estimates are consistent with average normal actual consumption in
compa.rable hotels. (To avoid overestimation of revenues, water supply to the two
villages which would be served by standpipes has not been included in the
estinates).
6.        In projecting water revenues, a constant rate of Rps 150 per m3 has been
used. This projection provides nothing more than a basic parameter. To the
extent that future room rates would permit increases in water rates without
impairing the viability of hotel operations, the basic rate could be increased to
achieve higher levels of rate of return for BTDC's Utility Section ; the same
applies to the sewerage rate, which has been tentatively estimated to be Rps 75
per m3 of water consumed.
7.        Operating costs for water supply and sewerage used in the projections
are rough overall estimates based on average cost per m3 of water processed as
tentatively determined by the consultants. For a typical operating year (1983)
the breakdown of total costs was assumed as follows:
Water Supply  Sewerge & Waste Diposal
(in mill. Rps)
Labor cost                    16                  14
Chemicals                     54                    8
Power & fuel                  43                   24
Maintenance                    7                    4
Total operating expenses    120                   50
8.        Depreciation has been estimated at a rate of 3.5p for water supply and
3% for sewerage. In addition, accrued interest has been assumed to be amortized
from the eighth year at a rate of Rps 70 million per annum to correspond with the
repaLyment of that portion of the Government contribution (see item 3).

APPRAISAL OF THE 13ALI TOURISM PROJECT
ROADS, BRIDGES AND STORMWATER DRAINAGE COMPONENT
A. Scope of the Project
1.        The Project consists of the construction of (i) an access
road to the resort area at Nusa Dua; (ii) a secondary road and street
network within the resort area itself; (iii) a by-pass road to the east
of Denpasar; and (iv) of the improvement of multipurpose roads north
of Denpasar. The location of these roads is shown on Map 2.1/
2.        The Project provides also for the construction of a stormwater
drainage system for the resort area at Nusa Dua consisting of open
ditches, some concrete pipelines, and swales.
B. Description of the Project
B.1 Access Road to Nusa Dua Resort Area
3.        At present, there is no direct connection between Tuban air-
port and Nusa Dua, except for a 17 km. long track through rough terrain
after having reached a plateau by means of a slope of more than 15%.
Modifying this track to meet good specifications for the longitudinal
profile would imply considerable earthwork in rocky areas (limestone).
During project preparation, four possible alternatives were studied for
the access road to Nusa Dua, of which the alternative having the most
direct alignment and the lowest cost was selected. The road under this
alternative would have only 8 km. in total length and would pass along
the east coast of the Tuban isthmus and following the shoreline of the
inland bay and would by-pass the towns of Jimbaran and Bualu. The geo-
metric design for this link road was determined by the volume of the an-
ticipated traffic, estimated to be 3,000 vehicles a day by 1983. The
design speed retained for this road in the engineering project is 80 km/h.
This speed is justified in order to move traffic rapidly over a stretch
not oriented towards sightseeing. Two 3.5 m wide lanes would be able to
adequately handle four-wheel and motorcycle traffic for the next twenty
years. The outside shoulders (1 m wide on both sides) would be narrower
than what is required by Indonesian standards in order to reduce earthwork,
I/ The economic justification of the roads component is contained in
Annex XI.

particularly in mangrove swamp areas. S nce the road would cross level
terrain, the maxinnum grade would be under 2%.
4.       The hard limestone fr-om a nearby quarry can be used for the
base course of the road, but tests performed with this material gave
disppointing results for using it in surface treatment because of the
inadequate strength of the material. There are numerous quarries of
stone of volcanic origin from which a good quality agaLomerate can be
obtained for surface treatment. Specifications would call for good
compacting in surface treatment, for a minimum usable life of 10 years.
5.        A section of about 9C0 m of the road would go through man-
grove swamps which are under water at high tide which reaches a maxi-
mur, 2.60 m.  iManual boring tests have shown that a coral-liraestone mass
is approximately 2 m. below the apparent surface of mud. A 60 m. long
bridge would be built over a natural drainage canal in the mangrove
swamp.
B.2 Secondary Roads and Streets in Nusa Dua Area
6.        These roads and streets would form a network to serve the
first-phase resort facilities in accordance with the layout plan and
w^ould be linked to the access road.  Length of individual roads and
streets would vary according to the layout. Total length would be
about 11 km. The average design speed adopted for these roads and
streets is 45 km/h. The width of almost all internal roads and streets
would include a roadway for four-whieeled vehicles and motorcycles (two
3 m. lanes) and also a 2 m.-wide path for bicycles. In total, the
roadway would be 10.80 m. wide. The shoulders separating the paved area
and the cycle path would be 1.30 m. wide. Vehicle paths would have one
3 m. lane with wider shoulders for permitting cars coming in opposite
direction to pass. Parking areas would be provided in the amenity core
and in the service areas.
7.        The project area is oinly slightly above sea level and fairly
flat.  The soil has high permeability.  It is proposed, therefore, that
stormwater would be collected in open ditches and would be infiltrated
into the soil with the help of infiltration pits, about 1.5 m. deep.
Thus the direct discharge of stornmTater into the sea would be avoided.
Within the area of the amenity core and community facilities concrete
pipelines would be used. Rainfall intensity data for the project area
are not available. But reasonable assumptions have been made in the
determination of design factors for the scheme.
B.3 Denpasar East By-Pass Road
8.        The construction of this road is essential in order to (a)
absorb part of the heavy traffic from the Bukit, Tuban and Kuta areas
towards Denpasar; (b) create a direct access from the airport to the
hotel complexes in Sanur; (c) permit tourists from Nusa Dua, Kuta and
Sanur resort areas to visit major cultural and scenic attractions located
in the northern part of the Island; and (d) ease the traffic congestion



ANNEX V
Page 3
within the central district of Denpasar. The proposed by-pass road would
be approximately 19 km. in length, would pass through the tourism area
of Kuta and would be the most direct route between the airport and the
hotels at Sanur.
9.        In the peak tourism periods, the average daily traffic expected
on this road by 1983 is about 5,000 vehicles with four or more wheels.
The design speed for this road would be 80 km/h as it was the case of
the Nusa Dua access road. The specifications would then be the same as
those described in Section B.1 above. The crossing of various streams
and rivers would require the construction of six bridges with lengths
varying from 12 m. to a maximum of 60 m.
B.4 Multipurpose Road Improvements
10.       Eleven existing roads totalling 199 km. would be improved to
facilitate access to Bali's major cultural and scenic attractions and to
ease the general traffic in the most important and dense ly populated
areas of the Island. The needs of tourism make it necessary to restruc-
ture a portion of the existing road network in order to permit the tour-
ists to discover the real Bali, its way of life and its culture. At the
same time, the improvement of these roads would contribute to the agri-
cultural development and the commercial activity of the Island, as weli
as permit the villages further from the resort areas to benefit more
directly from tourist expenditures.
1i.       Improvements would consist of repairing the base and shoulders
of the roadway, upgrading the road surface, improving the drainage
ditches, minor realignment of vertical curves, and replacement of old
and dangerous bridges. No major realignment of the existing roads and
no acquisition of properties are proposed. The replacement of bridges,
which comprises about 50% of the total cost, is essential for improving
traffic conditions. Most of the existing bridges are single lane struc-
tures built 40 to 50 years ago. Their maximum loading capacity is 3 tons.
As they are suspended bridges, the existing process has affected impor-
tant supporting elements.
12.       Tohpati-Klungkung Road (36 km):  Klungkung is the most impor-
tant commercial center of the densely populated agricultural core of the
Island. This road is essential for the transportation of agricultural
and manufactured products to the market centers and hotels, and for
tourist excursions to the art center of Ubud, the dances at Mas and
Bone, and the temples of Kehen and Besakih. Travelling north from
Tohpati, the existing asphalt road is 4.5 to 5.5 m. wide with 1 to 2 m.-
wide shoulders. Its surface is of inferior quality. Traffic between
Denpasar and Klungkung amounts today to approximately 1200 vehicles per
day. The effect of the tourist traffic in this total represents no more
than 25g, but the construction of new hotels in Kuta and Sanur and with
the opening of Nusa Dua resort area, it is expected that the general
traffic will be doubled by 1983 and that the participation of the tour-
ist traffic would increase to 50% or 60%. The improvements for this
road would include: reinforcement of the base course, widening of the



ANNLEX V
Page 4
oaved surface to 6 m., improving and widening shoulders for pedestrian
and bicyele traffic, a better drainage system, replacing two old bridges.
3I..     Klungkung-Besakih Road (22 km.):  This 4 m. wide mountain road
-in fair stage of repair up to Rendang. From this point on, the traffic
-is relatively small, except during religious festivities in the Besakih
temple. Improvements would include re-surfacing portions of the road,
re-alignment of a 2 kn. sector, and replacement of a 120 m. long tempor-
ary one-lane bridge.
L4.       Peteluan-Bangli Road (11 km.):  Recent traffic counts show
that ar. average of 80 vehicles per day use this road, serving an im-
portant agricultural and tourist area. The roadway is 4 m. wide with
3i m. wide shoulders. The surface seems to be in fair condition, but
the road is unsatisfactory both in cross and longitudinal sections.
1Improvements would include small reialignments and new base and sur-
facing (5 m. wide).
L5.       Sakah-Teges-Bedulu-Tampaksiring Road (20 km.):  This semi-
circled road has a traffic flow of 350 vehicles per day which is ex-
pected to increase to about 800 vehicles per day over the next ten
years. Considering the present geometric design of the road and the
traffic projections, it seems essential to improve the sub-base and
base courses--which are very light--,and to widen the roadway to 6 m.
it.       Teges-Ubud Road (5 km.):  From the road described in para. 15
above, this small road provides access to one of the most important
tourist attractions of Bali, the town of Ubud, the center of the local
streets of painters and sculpturers. Present traffic amounts to 180
vehicles per day. Tourist traffic is expected to increase in coming
years and it will have a great effect on the general traffic, which is
growing at a rate of approximately 10% per year.  Improvements would
involve widening the roadway to 6 mi., and the shoulders to 3 m.
17.       Bedulu-Semabaung Road (2 km.):  The roadbed is from 7 to 8 m.
wide, and the roadway from 4 to 5 m. wide.  In several stretches, the
road is in poor condition , where the base course should be reinforced.
This road is of great economic and tourist interest and should be put
into a good state of repair. Widening its paved area to 6 m. is essen-
tial.
18.       Batubulan-Payangan Road (2   m.):  This road is of economic
(agricultural) and tourist interest. The roadway and shoulders are 7
to 8 m. wide, and the 5 m. wide asphalt roadway is in rather bad con-
dition.  Traffic amounts to approxdnitely 300 vehicles per day.  The
road would be resurfaced but the same width would be maintained. Im-
provements should also include widening the shoulders for pedestrian
and bicycle traffic and repairing the drainage system, including trans-
versial structures.
O9.       Peguyangan-Sangeh Road (19 km.):  This road which directly
connects Denpasar and the Monkey F'orest, has only one stretch of about



ANNEX V
Page 5
1 km. in good condition. The stretch is 4 m. wide and asphalted. The
remaining 18 km. are in very poor condition, it is poorly asphalted and
its crushed-rock base course is quite deteriorated, particularly in the
last 8 km.  This road is of great economic and tourist importance, be-
cause of the agricultural development of the area and the tourist at-
traction of the Monkey Forest. No traffic count exists for this road,
but the tourist traffic is expected to increase substantially in the
next few years. The road should be put into a good state of repair.
This would mean grading, repairing the sub-base and base courses, widen-
ing the roadway to 5 m. and new surface treatment.
20.       Kediri-Tanahlot Road (11 km.):  This road has a relative eco-
nomic interest, but it is important because of the tourist and religious
attraction of the Tanahlot temples. No traffic count exists for the
road, but its volume seems relatively small. In the future, the traffic
may increase and reach about 120 vehicles per day if the route is put
into a good state of repair and continuously maintained. The roadbed
should be repaired and widened to 10 m., and the 3 m. wide roadway
would require a new asphaltic surface treatment.
21.       Ubung-Mengwi Tani-Kediri Road (16 km.):  The road and shoulders
are 8 m. wide, and the asphalt surface is 4 m. wide. It is in fair
state of repair. Traffic counts made in 1968 in the sector between
Denpasar and Mengwi-Tani show an average daily flow of 850 vehicles.
From Mengwi-Tani to Kediri there are no traffic counts. The road is of
much greater economic than tourist interest and should be put in good
state of repair. This includes base course repair on the deteriorated
stretches, double wearing course over about 15 km. and 5 m. wide new
surface treatment.
22.       Mengwi-Tani-Pancassari Road (36 km.): This section of the
national road connecting Denpasar with Singaradja is of great economic
interest. The Batan Lake area is also a very important tourist attrac-
tion. The 6 m. wide asphalt cover is in good condition, but the base
course has suffered damage in some sect:lons.  The average traffic flow
has been estimated to be 180 vehicles per day. As a result, of the new
hotel developments, an annual traffic increment of about 8% should be
added. The improvements to this road should include base course repair
and new surface treatment over about 12 km.
C. Cost Estimates
23.       The estimated costs of roadworks, bridges and stormwater
drainage are summarized in Annex I, Tables 2.6, 2.7, 2.12 and 2.13.
Cost estimates for the internal roads were prepared by consultants and
cost estimates for all roads outside the resort area were prepared by
Bina Marga, the highway department of the Ministry of Public Works.
They were reviewed during the time of appraisal. Costs are based on
Indonesian cost of goods and civil works and should be adequate. A
physical contingency allowance of 15% has been assumed for these com-
ponents. The price contingency has been estimated on the basis of
projections of future, local and international price level changes



ANNEX V

during the construction period. Final engineering costs were estim-
ated at 4% and cost of supervision at 6% of construction costs plus
price increases. The total cost (including contingencies) is es-
timated at US$12.7 million for roadworks and bridges, and US$0.8
million for stormwater drainage.
D. Procurement and Project Execution
24.       Contracts for the implementation of the road works would be
subject to international competitive bidding. With respect to the
improvement on the eleven multipurpose roads, contracts would be
tendered either individually or combined into bidding groups, at the
bidders option, in order to permit local contractors to tender for
works of a size within their capabilities and to attract foreign
bidders.
25.       The Bali Tourism Development Corporation (BTDC) would employ
consultants for the design and construction supervision of the internal
roads and stormwater drainage and would also be responsible for their
maintenance.
26.       Bina  Marga, the highway-department of the Ministry of
Works, would design all roads and bridges to be built outside the
resort area and would also be responsible for construction super-
vision and for their maintenance. Bina Marga has been the bene-
ficiary of three credits from the Association for Highway Projects
(INS - 154, 260 and 388).

ELECTRICITY SUPPLY
A. Responsibility for Electricity Supply
1.        The national power company, "Perasahaan Umum Listrik Negara"
(PLN), would be responsible for supplying electricity to the Nusa Dua
area. The facilities to provide this service would not form part of
the IDA financed project. PLN would undertake the work required to
link the Nusa Dua area to its local power system and assure that suf-
ficient generating capacity to serve the future customers in their
area would be available as and when needed.
2.        An application for partial financing of the required invest-
ments has been submitted to the U.K. Government. During negotiations
agreement was reached that the scheme for extension of PLN's power
facilities would be carried out in time to meet the demands of the
Nusa Dua estate.
B. Proposed Extension of PLN's Power Facilities
3.        A new diesel power plant with a total generating capacity of
30 mw is presently being built near Denpasar under a scheme partly
financed by the U.K. Government. In addition, the scheme already in-
cludes a transmission line to the town of Djimbaran and provision for
an extension to Nusa Dua.
4.        Electricity would be brought to the Nusa Dua resort area by
a double circuit transmission line from the new power plant. This
line would be designed for 70 kv but would be operated initially at
20 kv. At the end of the transmission line a substation with switch-
gears and eight feeders would be erected. From there distribution would
be facilitated by a loop system of underground cables and further four
switching stations with six feeders each. The voltage of the distribu-
tion system would be 20 kv. The connection to individual hotels and
BTDC facilities and the provision of transformers would be the respon-
sibility of the consumers. Standby generators for emergency power supply
are recommended to be installed also by major consumers; BTDC would in-
stall such a standby unit as part of the IDA financed project (see
Annex I). The villages Benoa and Bualu, located in the immediate vicin-
ity of the resort area would receive electricity by overhead lines from
the Nusa Dua substation.
5.        The power demand for the Nusa Dua area (including the villages)
was estimated to be 15 MW by the end of 1982. To meet this demand it is
envisaged by PLN that the generating capacity of the Denpasar power
plant be increased by an extra 5 MW by 1982 in order to maintain the
reliability standards of the power station.
6.        It is estimated that the total cost of the PLN project for
electricity supply of Nusa Dua, including contingencies, would be about



A4INEX VI
Page 2
US$3.06 million of which about US$2.52 million would be foreign exchange.
The estimates are based on PLN's unit costs for similar systems, in-
cluding allowances of 15% for physical contingencies and a price con-
tingency based on projected price level changes during the construction
period. Details are given in Table 1.
7.        The extensions of PLN's local power systems are based on pro-
jection of electricity consumptionr as shoiwn in Table 2, which also in-
cludes a very tentative estimate of the financial results presently
expected by PLN for the period 1974-82. The projections, however, do
not represent a full assessment of PLN's future financial position
which has been analyzed in more detail in connection with the IDA
credits 165 and 334.

INDONESIA - BALI TOURISM PROJECT
ELECTRICITY SUPPLY
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINAlCIANJ PROJECTIONS
General
1.     In projecting the financial results of PLN's Denpasar regional office no
attempt has been made to analyze the general load forecast which is based on
best estimates of PLN and its engineering consultants. The overall objective
of the analysis made for purposes of the tourism project appraisal was to
determine:
(a) whether PLN's Denpasar regional office had made adequate
provision for the expected demand from the Nusa Dua resort
area;
(b) whether the additional load can be expected to generate
sufficient revenue at the proposed tariffs to cmtribute
to a gradual improvement in PLN's rate of return; and
(c) whether the cost of electricity per occupied hotel room
would represent a reasonable charge both in view of
actual costs and in view of expected hotel revenue.
Demand
2..     The projection of electricity supply to hotels is based on the
assumption of an average demand of 4.6 KW per hotel room including allowance
for the service area. Average annual consumption was asswned at 22165 kwh,
using a load factor of 55%. This would result in average consumption per
occupied room per day ranging from 115 kwh to 81 kwh for average occupancy
levels from 55% to 71%.
3.      The consumption of other consumers in the Nusa Dua area is based on
betst estimates of PIN's consultants and these are considered reasonable.
4.-     Overall demand as estimated by PLN's consultants would require operation
of 44 MW of generating capacity by 1982 and additional investment of about
Rps 10 billion during the period 1974-1982.
Revenue
5..     In the revenue projections it has been assumed that PLN's Denpasar
branch would achieve an average revenue of 14.0 Rps/kwh in 1975, based on the
rate regulation which went into effect on July 1, 1973, in accordance with the
commitments of PLN to IDA under Credit 334 IND. A further rate increase of
1C)% was assumed in October 1976 which would eventually raise average revenue
to 16.0 Rps/kwh, and ultimately by an additional adjustment of 5% in 1980 to
16.6 Rps/kwh. It was also assumed that the tariff for medium voltage supply
to hotels would not be raised to more than 11.0 Rps/kwh and that the average
rate for other commercial and 'Low voltage consumers in Nusa Dua, including
street lighting, would be not more than 15.0 Rps/kwh. This would necessitate



ANNEX VI
Notes to Table 2
Page 2
a gradual increase in average revenue for the general load in Denpasar from
14.0 Rps/kwh in 1975 to 19.7 Rps/kwh in 1982. The assumptions made are
consistent with the recommendations in a stpdy of the Denpasar branch cost
structure made by PLN's engineering consultants.
6.      The average revenue per kiO projected for PLN's Denpasar branch is
higher than that for PLN's overall operations, because it does not include
operations outside Denpasar in the outlying areas which contribute towards
PLN's weak financial position in general (see Appraisal Report 87a-IND,
May 10, 1973).
Operating Costs
7.      Operating expenses are based on detailed calculations of unit costs
per kwh prepared by PLN's engineering consultants as adjusted by PIN. These
calculations are based on an assumed expansion program designed to meet
estimated demand by 1983. The program includes installation of the facilities
included in the Nusa Dua tourism project, additional generating capacity
totalling 70 MW of which 30 MW wfould be hydro, and related transmission and
distribution system expansion.
3.      The average cost per unit sold was assumed to decrease, as a result
of greater efficiency of new plant and the use of hydro power towards the end
of the forecast period, from 13.3 RpsAkwh in 1974 to 9.5 Rps/kwh in 1982.
9.      Depreciation was based on a detailed calculation by PLN's consultants,
assuming 15 years' useful life for generating plant and 20 years for distri-
bution and transmission facilities.

APPRAISAL OF THE BALI TOURISM PROJECT
Hotel Training Center
1.        The proposed tourism project includes funds to cover the costs
of construction and equipment of a new hotel training center in Bali,
which is to be operated by the BTDC. This annex presents the background
information on which the training component is based.
2.        The training needs of Indonesia's tourism sector were reviewed
by a Swiss Investigation Mission in the fall of 1971 and by ILO consul-
tants in early 1972. As a result of their reportsll/Swiss Technical
Cooperation has helped the Indonesian authorities to establish a new
National Hotel Institute in the premises of the (now defunct) National
Hotel Academy at Bandung, Java and ILO (acting as Executing Agency for
UNDP which is providing the funds) is carrying out a project which con-
sists of a crash training program and preparatory work for the setting
up of training establishments in Bali and Jakarta. Successive IDA
missions, which helped prepare and appraise the Bali Tourism Project
benefited especially from the work of some of the ILO technicians,
who in response to a request from the Indonesian authorities and the
IDA appraisal mission prepared a preliminary report on Bali tourism
training needs in August 19731/
3.        The findings of the Swiss and ILO missions, as well as the
IDA's appraisal team, with respect to the training needs of the hotel
industry in Indonesia as a whole, are suimmarized below:
(i) The Indonesian hotel industry is undergoing a period of
very rapid growth with the number of rooms of all categories of hotels
likely to have increased from less than 4,000 in 1971 to more than
double that number in early 1974.
(ii) The employee-room ratio varies between 3.3 for some of
the large, luxury hotels to 1.5 for the small ones. It seems appro-
priate to use an average employee-ratio of 2 in estimating future man-
power requirements and resulting training needs.

(iii)  On the basis of very conservative estimates of the rate
at which visitor arrivals and accomnodation capacity will increase dur-
ing the next 10 years, an annual minimum of 3,000 hotel personnel will
.eauire training. IMloreover, of the presently employed hotel personnel
of about 8,000, very few received any training before employment and
at least 50% require further traini;ng.
(iv)  There are at present only three official training pro-
grams in operation:  in Bandung, Jakaroa and Bali. The new Swiss-
assisted National Hotel institutea a-t Bandung, which started oneration
in February 1973 is expected to graduate annually about 250 students
and 15 instructors in the four main hotel specialities (restaurant,
housekeeping, kitchen and reception), all at the basic and medium
level.  In Jakarta, the Regional Touarist Office is sponsoring a scheme
in operation since April 1972, under which 55 trainees are given three
terms of 6-month duration followed by in-between six months on-the-job
training in Jakarta hotels, spread over a period of three years.
Finally, in Bali since 1969, basic level courses of 7/8-month duration
are given by a small training schoo:L under the responsibility of the
Regional Tourist office, followed by a 4-month period of work in the
local hotels.  The 1973 enrollment was 328 students.  Of these three
official training programs only .he recently inaugurated Swiss-sup-
ported program operates in suitab:le quarters with reasonably adequate
equipment and some full-time staff. The Jakarta courses are given in
premises designed for primary education and in Bali the local home
economics school is used in the Late afternoon.  There is an almst
total lack of equipment and instructional materials; it is difficult
to provide for practical training of students since the large first-
class hotels.--where training wouLd be most beneficial--are often over-
staffed; and, finally the teachers are almost all part-time or there is
a rapid turnover of full-time teachers, with the quality of instruction
often poor. The main reason for this last serious difficulty is the
fact that in early 1973 teachers in State institutions received a
monthly salary of about 8,000 rupiahs compared with 15,000 rupiahs
which a basic level employee eanis at the Hotel Indonesia and 50,000
to 60,000 rupiahs which would be competitive with salaries for well
qualified higher level hotel staff. The only way in which this dif-
ficulty has been (temporarily) overcome in the new Bandung National
Hotel Institute is by Swiss finarncing of supplementary remuneration
of the full-time teachers.
(v) With official training programs at best able to accom-
rnodate 15-20% of the staff which will be needed by the hotel industry
every year and only the recently started Swiss supported institute in
Bandung providing basic and medium level training of acceptable quality,
it ;s hardly surprising that a great number of private hotel training
schools have sprung up in both Jakarta and Bali in recent years.  The
18 existing private schools in Jakarta have an estimated enrollment of
almost 2,000 pupils with an average arnnual turnout of about 1,500.  In
Bali, four private schools have an enrollment of about 6h0 pupils with
an average annual output of about 350 graduates, two-thirds of whom
will have received basic and the remainder middle level training.



Ai4NEX VII

Almost all these schools are part--:ime with classes held in the evening,
with instructors who are "moon-lighting" personnel from the hotels, i.e.
whose teachers' salaries are additional to their regular earnings. The
quality of instruction in the private schools varies widely. Some,
like "Trisakti", a Dutch financed private institution in Jakarta, with
an enrollment of 650 students, appears to command the respect of the
hotel trade. Others are doubtless of the fly-by-night variety. In
many cases, the judgment of the Swiss investigation mission is clearly
warranted that the private schools "are even less well-equipped and
have fewer teachers than those run by the State".
(vi) It is evident that existing hotel training facilities--
both official and private--are insufficient in size and quality of in-
struction, equipment and training aids to meet the minimum needs of
the expanding hotel industry for reasonably well-trained basic and
medium-level staff. The Swiss supported Bandung National Hotel Insti-
tute constitutes a very promising beginning in upgrading the training
facilities in Java. ILO and the Indonesian authorities are working orn
possible ways to improve the quality of instruction in the Jakarta
training schools. The proposed new hotel training center in Bali,
which is to form part of the IDA financed tourism project, is designed
to upgrade the existing "official" training facility and to operate it
in close cooperation with the existing and future hotel enterprises.
The proposed solution is based on the more detailed analysis of future
manpower requirements and existing training facilities in Bali presen-
ted in subsequent paragraphs.
1.        In mid-1973, there were about 900 hotel rooms of all cate-
gories in Bali, of which about one-half were of an internationally
acceptable standard, (i.e. fully aiif-conditioned, with modern kitchen
facilities and enough room to accommodate relatively large tour groups).
By April 1974, the date of the Pata Conference, it is expected that
the number of internationally acceptable rooms will have reached about
1,050, with another 500-600 rooms due to be built by 1976. This will
raise the total to about 1,600, the present limit fixed by the Indonesian
Government for internationally acceptable rooms outside of Nusa Dua.
By 1978, the first hotels at liusa Dua with a capacity of 700-800 rooms
are expected to start operation and in the subsequent five years
another 1,700-1,800 internationally acceptable rooms are to be built
on sites of the proposed tourism estate.
5.        The accommodation facilities on Bali, which are not of fully
international standard consist of small hotels of varying quality. Some
are unusually attractive; they cater to a specialized international and
national clientele; other appeal to the youth market (which is primarily
Australian); a large number cater primarily to the domestic trade. Many
of them are expanding and it seems likely that in 1978 the number of
rooms of these smaller hotels will have more than doubled (from 450 to
about 1,000 rooms). In addition, there are several hundred rooms
available in guest houses and private rooms in some of the compounds.
However, these facilities do not employ a significant number of staff
on a full-time basis.



ANNEX VII
Page 4
6.        in mid-1973, a total of about 2,000 people were employed by
Baii's hotel industry, about l,000 in the international standard hotels
and another 1,000 in the lower category hotels.  On the basis of the
projection of new international category rooms likely to be built in the
next 10 years, it can be estimated that the number of hotel employees
to be engaged by international standard hotels will be about 3,200 in
1976, around 5,000 by 1978 and close to 8,500 by 1983. When the likely
expansion of lower category hotels is taken into account, about 800
new employees will be needed every year during the coming decade.
7.        As noted previously, there are at present one official and
four Drivate institutions for the training of hotel employees in Bali.
Three of them offer one-year basic training courses to 600 pupils,
the other two schools provide three-year higher level training to
another 200 pupils.  In addition, there are two training institutions
for hotel secretarial staff and tourist guides.
8.        After assessing the physical facilities, the curriculum and
the quality of the teaching staff of the existing official and private
institutions, the IL0 experts who had made a preliminary survey of the
existing training facilities in Bali, the Indonesian authorities and
the IDA appraisal mission reached the following basic conclusions con-
cerning the proposed training center:
(i) Most existing institutions are highly unsatisfactory.
They operate 3 to 4 hour eveninjg classes only; use rented or borrowed.
quarters; have virtually no equipment, teaching aids or written instruc-
tional material and use only "mo)on-lighting" part-time instructors.
Despite these handicaps, the official training school has been doing
a relatively creditable job in preparing basic-level employees for
hotel employment and has enjoyed a closer association and better co-
operation from the hotels than the other Indonesian official training
programs. The offical school thius offers the best basis for creating
a more adequate training system.
(ii) With over 80 percent of new entrants into the hotel
labor force needing basic and medium level training, it seems advisable
that the proposed new training center serve primarily to upgrade such
training, without excluding the possibility of providing special manage-
ment and higher level technical training once the new institution is
well established and has won the full support of the hotel owners and
operators. The need for adequate training of basic-level personnel is
particularly great in a relatively remote island like Bali. The young
Balinese high school graduates of both sexes, who constitute the bulk
of the trainees in the existing official school and will doubtless
form the greater part of the studenLt body of the new training center,
hm-:- had relatively little contact with the outside world.  They need
to gain basic knowledge concerning internationa'l hotel standards (in-
C i ud inL hygienic standards, preparation of western style food, etc.),
receive background information on all phases of hotel operations and
tourism in addition to training in routine hotel tasks and intensive



ANNEX VII
Page 5
training in English. It was tentatively agreed that basic-level trainees
will need a 6-month period of institutional training before taking their
first job. Medium-level training will have to cover not only basic
skills but many aspects of hotel management. Medium-level staff should
receive 6-montlh training on a part-time basis since it would be essen-
tially designed to upgrade the skills of those already working in hotels.
Initially, the new training center might serve 250-300 basic-level
trainees per year and about 100 medium-level trainees; in subsequent
years in excess of 400 basic-level and 150 medium-level trainees might
be trained every year.
(iii) The new training center should be constructed on land
already set aside for this purpose by the Government of Bali--a site
located between Denpasar and Sanur. The preliminary plans for the new
training center, based on a class size of 25 pupils, call for eight
classrooms (including language laboratories), a library, an auditorium,
four well-equipped workshops (i.e. kitchen, restaurant, bar, Front
Office/Accounting and Housekeeping) as well as housing facilities for
four full-time teachers (one for each professional category). The
total cost of the new training center is estimated to be about US$1.1
million including the cost of land, construction, equipment and profes-
sional services.
(iv) The UNDP financed vocational training project for hotel
and tourism personnel, for which ILO is the executing agency, calls for
a 3-man team, consisting of an adviser in hotel and tourism planning
(team leader), an expert in hotel and tourism school design and a
training equipment specialist to visit Indonesia, including Bali, for
2-3 months beginning in May 1974. It has been agreed that they will
give first priority to helping the Indonesian authorities prepare de-
tailed plans for the organization of the new hotel training center in
Bali including detailed curricula, criteria for the selection of trainees,
staff requirements, and a schedule of accommodations for the center.
These would be submitted to the Association by December 31, 1974. Final
design and supervision of construction would be carried out by consul-
tants. The final design would be submitted to the Association for its
approval by June 30, 1975.
(v) As noted previously, it is of vital importance for the
success of the proposed new training institution that it be organized,
operated and financed with the active cooperation of the hotel indus-
try and that it should be able to secure the services of a nucleus of
well-qualified full-time instructors. Experience indicated that official
Indonesian hotel training organizations have found it virtually impos-
sible to pay their teachers adequate salaries and they have great dif-
ficulty in securing technical, let alone financial support from the
hotels. Having the Bali Tourism Development Corporation (BTDC) con-
struct, equip and operate the new training center in close cooperation
with the hotels to which it will lease sites in the tourism estate ap-
pears to hold out the promise of overcoming these difficulties. Even
though it will be wholly Government-owned, the BTDC as a P.T. is not



AMNEX VII
Page 6
subject to the same limitations in setting salaries as a state-training
institution which depends for its financing entirely on the budget. It
should thus be able to pay the full-time teachers' salaries competitive
with those they would earn in well-paid hotel jobs. Moreover, the four
senior full-time teaching positions will have the additional attraction
that the new training center will provide the teachers with housing.
As for the cooperation of the hotel sector, BTDC will be able to assure
the financial support by the new 'hotels which will establish themselves
in Nusa Dua through appropriate provisions in the lease contracts and/
or a small increase in the service charges paid by the hotels. As for
the hotels outside the Nusa Dua area, BTDC should be able to get them
to support the new training center by providing part-time teachers and
on-the-job training facilities. In order to assure the closest coordina-
tion with the hotels and the Ctantral and Provincial tourism officials
in planning and operating the training center, it has been agreed that
BTDC would form a special board to give advice on the center's activi-
ties, on which the hotels and the Provincial tourism officials would be
represented.
(vi)  Preliminary estimates indicate that total annual operating
costs of the school will be of the order of US$70,000. On the basis of
past experience, it appears that an annual tuition fee of 20,000 rupiahs
(or US$50) per pupil would not be unacceptable. The annual revenue
from pupils' fees would thus totaL close to $20,000 once the school is
in full operation. BTDC shouldl have little difficulty in covering from
its land lease fees and service charges the difference between the
revenues from pupils' fees and the schools' operating costs.
9.        Financing Plan
The 1974-76 financing plan for the hotel training center can
be s.mmarized as follows:
Requirements
(mllions)    (thousands)
Local costs                    221.7         534.2

10.       The Indonesian authorities, ILO and UNDP, are actively dis-
cussing a possible second UNDP financed project which would include
funds for expatriate teachers who would be assigned to the Bali tourism
training center for the first few years as well as the financing of
training abroad for some of the Indonesian teaching staff.

APPRAISAL OF THE BALI TOURISM PROJECT
Agricultural Technical Assistance
Introduction
1.        At the present time, the hotels on Bali are relying signif-
icantly on foodstuffs grown and processed on Java or imported from
other countries. Although some effort has already been made to orient
the agricultural sector on Bali toward supplying the hotels, 1the pro-
duce available locally is typically characterized by (a) inadequate
and uncertain quantity, (b) uneven quality, and (c) limited variety.
In addition, local farmers sell their produce to the hotels through
brokers, receiving only about a third of what the brokers receive from
the hotels. The further development of tourism on Bali, and the resul-
tant increases in demand for fruits, vegetables, poultry and livestock
products, would provide a number of opportunities to change this situ-
ation.
2.        The technical and financial assistance described below is de-
signed to maximize the effectiveness of the tourism sector in further-
ing the economic development of BaLi through (a) insuring adequate sup-
plies of agricultural products to the hotels at a minimum cost (in part
by reducing transport costs), (b) improving the share of tourism bene-
fits which remain in Bali by reducing the imports from Java and from
abroad, and (c) improving the distribution of benefits within Bali,
particularly as between farmer and various middlemen. At the same
time, of course, the increased supply of local agricultural products
would reduce the hotel's reliance on imported food stuffs, and thereby
increase the net foreign exchange earnings from tourism.
3.        In order to help ensure that increased supplies will in fact,
develop, the tourism project would include about US$ 300,000 of tech-
nical and financial assistance for the agricultural sector. The spe-
cific components of this assistance are described below.
Vegetable Production
L.        Technical assistance for gearing up the vegetable producing
capacity would take the form of a small (about 10 hectares) agricultural
1/ See Table 3 for current levels of produce sales by a group of far-
mers organized specifically for supplying vegetables to the hotel
industry.



ANNEX VIII
Page 2
station to be established ^y the Govermaent, with the assistance of
a technical adviser for an initial period. Tne primary functions of
the station would include (a) production demonstration, (b) vegetable
grading, (c) seeds production and (d) contract negotiations with
hotels and restaurants. Excluding the cost of land, which is assumed
to be provided by the Government, the investment costs are estimated
as follows:
Ru *ahs     US$
(000)
Site preparation                               1,200     2,900
Buildings and Water Supply                     4,800   1i,;600
Agricultural and other equipment               6,100    14,700
Price level adjustment to January 1974         1,300     3,100
Su.b-total                               13,400    32,300
Contingencies                                  5,500    13,300
Professional Services                          1,700     4,100
lnitial working capital                        4,800    11,600
Land Acquisition                              20,800    50,000
Total                                   46,200   111,300
The services of the adviser would be required in order to
establish the station and to guide both the production and the mar-
keting efforts during the first three years of operation.  He would,
at the same time, train a counterpart Balinese who would be respon-
sible for operating the farm. The estimated cost, including travel
and living expenses and fringe benefits would be about US$50,000
per year or about US$150,000 for three years.
6.        The establishment of the agricultural station would be the
responsibility of the Bali office cf the Ministry of Agriculture.
Following the initial three-year development period, the farm could
be sold as a cooperative venture to local farmers.
Poultry and Egg Production
7.        In order to improve the quantity and quality of poultry and
egg production, technical and financial assistance would be required
over about a three-year period. Technical assistance would take the
forn; of approximately two man-months of a technical adviser, includ-
ing an initial visit of 4-5 weeks to advise on what needs to be done
and, later, a 3-4 week follow-up visit to ensure that the recommen-
dations are being implemented effectively. The estimated cost of
this- expert, including travel and living expenses would be about
US$10,000. Responsibility for implementing the technical recom-
mendations would be that of the Bali office of the Ministry of
Agriculture.
8.        In addition to technical assistance, local poultry farmers
would require a small amount of financial assistance in the form of
approximately US$35,000 of meditn term credit.  Assurances were



ANNEX VIII
Page 3
obtained during negotiations that the Government will cause such credit
to be made available through the Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI).
Beef and Pork Production
9.        The general quantity and quality of beef cattle and hogs on
Bali appear to be sufficient to meet current hotel requirements, and
the expansion of supply for future requirements is not expected to
pose major difficulties. What is deficient currently is the quality
of butchered meat, since hotels and restaurants generally require care-
fully cut meat sections in order to allow for portion control. In
order to overcome this deficiency, and to allow for economies of scale,
it has been proposed that the BTDC be responsible for securing the co-
operation of Nusa Dua hotels in the establishment of a small common
slaughter-house to be financed and operated by the hotels. In addition,
the BTDC would review initial marketing contracts with local livestock
producers in order to ensure that they receive an equitable price for
their cattle and hogs.
Financial Plan
10.       The estimated total costs of the above technical and financial
assistance and the proposed sources of funds, can be summarized as fol-
lows:
Uss

11.       The IDA credit would cover 88% of the estimated foreign ex-
change costs of the agricultural station and the expatriate technical
experts, with the balance being provided by Government contributions,
plus the medium term credit for poultry farmers through the BRI.

APPRAISAL OF THE BALI TOURISM PROJECT
Market Demand and Hotel Development
A. Market Demand
Market Characteristics
1.        Bali is located between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, about 400
miles southeast of Jakarta and relatively close to the three most highly
developed tourist centers of Southeast Asia: Singapore, Bangkok and
Hongkong. It occupies a strategic location between Australia and the main-
land of Asia. Bali has a long-standing image among foreigners as among the
most exotic of the South Pacific islands, possessing great natural beauty
anld unique cultural attractions. The possibility of combining cultural,
scenic and beach tourism has a strong appeal to wide segments of the tour-
ism market.
2.        The tourists likely to be attracted by Bali comprise three
distinct market segments:
(i)  Vacation tourists on multiple stop group tours
throughout Southeast Asia.  This market has expanded
very rapidly in recent years, partly on the basis of
charter flights from Europe and Japan, but has thus
far hardly been tapped by Bali. The main reason has
been the lack of accommodation suitable for sizeable
groups of foreign tourists. Group tours are a natural
and most promising tourist market for Bali, because
the island will complement rather than compete with
destinations like Singapore, Bangkok and Hongkong, and
thereby increase the attractiveness of the Southeast
Asia region as a whole for the multi-destination
package or group tours. Such groups are likely to
spend not more than 2-3 days in the island.
(ii)  Vacation tourists from Australia, New Zealand, other
neighboring countries in Southeast Asia and, in the
longer run, Japan, for all of whom Bali would be a
single destination resort. Australian vacationists
are already coming to Bali for relatively longer
periods than other tourists. They tend to spend up
to three weeks in Bali.
(iii)  Business travellers to Indonesia, mainly Jakarta,
still account for the largest part of total arrivals
(300,000 in 1973) in Indonesia as a whole. This seg-
ment of Bali's tourist market is not unimportant, but
has not been developed to its full potential - again
because of the lack of suitable accommodation in Bali



Annex IX
Page 2
and the considerable difficulty in obtaining plane
reservations for the Jakarta-Bali flight at short
notice. A related market segment consists of foreign
businessmen and officials, and their families, resi-
dent in Indonesia. Both these business market seg-
ments are likely to be oriented primarily to weekend
tourism.  Foreigr residents, however, might well have
more extended stays than non-resident business visitors.
3.        The analysis which follows is an attempt to assess the impact on
the Bali tourism market of the growth of each of the above market segments
under various assumptions regarding the potential impact of the energy crisis.
It begins with an analysis of historic trends as an indication of possible
future development. Because of its potential effects on demand, Indonesia's
air access policy is also briefly discussed.
Past Trends in Foreign Visitor Traffic to Bali
4.        According to the official data collected by the local immigration
authorities, the number of foreign arrivals in Bali was 60,650 in 1972.
However, this represents only the number of foreign visitors who arrived in
Bali directly from abroad, and excludes the substantial number of foreigners
who came to Bali after first disembarking in Jakarta or other points in
Indonesia. On the basis of hotel registration data in Bali, it has been
estimated that the total number of foreign arrivals, including those who came
from Jakarta and other cities in the country, was about 80,000 in 1972 and
95,000 in 1973. From a comparison of these figures with the 37,000 arrivals
in 1969, estimated by the French consultants (SCETO) who also analyzed hotel
registration data, it appears that during the last four years the number of
foreign visitors to Bali has, on1 the average, increased by 27% per annum.
5.        Data obtained from the 300-room Bali Beach Hotel for 1972 indicate
that Western Europeans with 36 percent constituted the largest group among
foreign visitors to Bali, followed by North Americans with 28 percent,
Australians and Japanese with 12 percent and 11 percent, respectively while
visitors from other countries of: Southeast Asia accounted for about 9 percent.
A study of similar data of some of the smaller tourist type hotels and informa-
tion obtained from tour operators indicates that the above breakdown of
visitors by area of origin reflects reasonably well the situation for Bali
as a whole. The data also indicate that the number of Japanese visitors
has been growing particularly rapidly in the last three years.
6.        Tourist traffic to Bali is fairly even throughout the year, except
for a relatively slack period in June. The peak months are August and October,
followed by the spring months of' March to May. Most of the foreign visitors
arrive in Bali by air. At present there are 73 flights to Bali a week. Of
the total, 42 are domestic flights, Twenty-five flights combine domestic
and international air service through Jakarta, and six are direct interna-
tional flights.



Annex IX
Page 3
7.        The average length of stay of foreign visitors to Bali is rela-
tively short: 2-3 nights. This reflects the large number of vacation
touritts who come to Bali as a part of tour programs which include various
other destinations in Southeast Asia. The average group on package tour
consists of 30-40 tourists. Some visitors, of course, come to Bali on the
basis of their own arrangements, including foreigners resident in the
country. Most of the tourists take sightseeing trips to visit temples,
volcanoes and other tourist attractions in Bali for at least half of their
stay which averages three days.
8.        Based on current expenditure patterns of tourists who come to
Bali on group or package tours, the average daily expenditure in Bali has
been estimated at about US$46, which is higher than the average tourist
expenditure in Indonesia as a whole and is relatively high compared with
daily expenditures in other tourist destinations in Southeast Asia (except
for Hongkong and Singapore where shopping accounts for more than half the
daily expenditures; see Table 5 of this Annex).
Future Foreign Visitor Traffic to Bali
9.        In assessing the likely flow of foreign tourists to Bali over
the next few years, it is important to stress that until very recently
demand has been severely repressed because of the scarcity of acceptable
accommodation. There are several indications that a much more rapid growth
in visitor arrivals would have occurred had it not been for this bottleneck.
Firstly, at the time of appraisal in mid-1973, local tour operators stated
that most of them could have more than doubled the number of groups anid
individual visitors to the island if they could have secured firm room
commitments. Secondly, the existing hotels of acceptable international
standard have experienced very high average yearly room occupancies (about
85-90%) in recent years. Indeed, the two first-class hotels on Bali which
were in operation prior to November.1973 have been able to insist that
tour organizers make up to three months advance reservations, including
substantial guarantee payments. Thirdly, confirming the existence of
frustrated demand, the new 400-room Bali Hyatt Hotel which was inaugurated
in November 1973 had reportedly heavy booking for several months in advance.
Fourthly, although the Indonesian authorities liberalized direct air access
to Bali for charter flights in early 1973, tour operators were unable to
organize such flights because of the lack of hotels where large groups
could be booked. Finally, in the absence of this constraint, it might have
been expected that the growth in visitor arrivals in Bali would have
paralleled the rate of growth of pleasure travel to Indonesia as a whole,
especially since Bali is the country's prime tourist attraction. Instead,
arrivals in Bali grew by only 27% per year between 1969-73 while visitor
arrivals to Indonesia as a whole were growing by over 50%.
10.       Of the three market segments likely to be attracted to Bali,
multiple-stop group tours to Southeast Asia are the most important. They
may account for about two-thirds of Bali's tourism market. The potenLtial
of this market may be gauged by noting that the number of visitor arrivals
to Singapore, Bangkok and Hongkong grew by 20% per annum on the average
over the last five years reaching 783,000, 821,000 and 1,082,000 respec-
tively in 1972, of which over 60% were on vacation, most of them on group



Annex IX
Page 4
tours. Until recently, U.S. visitors consituted the largest proportion
among such tourists but in the last five years group tourism from Japan,
Europe and Australia grew much faster and by 1972 U.S., Japanese and
Western European tourists each accounted for close to 20% of total visio
tors to the three cities, with Japanese group tourism having experienced
the most rapid growth. Before the recent advent of the world-wide energy
crisis, there was little reason to doubt that the rapid increase in group
tourism to Southeast Asia would continue and perhaps even accelerate and
that Bali would be in a particularly good position to benefit from this
trend.
11.       The energy crisis may affect the flow of group tourism in two
major ways:  first, it may lead to an economic setback of the major tour-
ist generating economies, especially Japan and Western Europe, in the next
year or two and in a significant slowing in the rate of growth of these
economies over the next 5-7 years; second, the spectacular rise in the
price of petroleum products will tend to increase airfares (including
charter rates) and thru its impact: on the balance of payments of some
important tourist generating countries lead to the devaluation of major
currencies making foreign travel more costly and/or leading to the impo-
sition of direct foreign currency restrictions for vacation travel. It is
by no means clear, however, that t:he resulting slowing down in the growth
of group tourism to Southeast Asia or even a temporary stagnation of this
traffic will have a corresponding impact on the group tour market for Bali.
At present the island receives less than 5% of total tourist visiting the
three major tourist centers of Southeast Asia. In 1974, for the first time
Bali will have sufficient internat:ionally acceptable accommodation facilities
to begin to take advantage of the previously repressed level of demand for
individual and tour group bookings. It is therefore reasonable to conclude
that a higher share of the Southeast Asian tour market can be captured for
Bali in the future which would assure an increasing flow of tourists even
in the absence of a continuing increase in the tourist traffic to Southeast
Asia a a whole.
12.       The number of AustraliarLs and other vacationists coming to Bali as
a single destination has been growing significantly in recent years. In the
opinion of the tour operators, the increasing availability of GIT rates and
charter flights will lead to a very narked expansion in the flow of such
tourists once more accommodation is available in Bali. Because of its rela-
tive self-sufficiency in oil resources, and the strength of the world market
for Australia's major exports, the impact of the energy crisis on the Aus-
tralian economy is not likely to te very severe. Hence, there is good
reason to believe that over the medium and long-run, the GIT fares and char-
ter flights will largely offset the impact of the energy crisis on the Aus-
tralian market, so that Australian. tourism to Bali will continue to grow
at about the same rate as in the past.
13.       As to the third market segment, business travelers, it is relevant
to note that Indonesia is the most important oil producing country in South-
east Asia and will, in the next few years, be a major beneficiary of the
spectacular rise in the price of petroleum. Further, Indonesia will be an



Annex IX
Page 5
increasingly interesting and profitable export market and, because of
its oil and natural gas resources, will attract much foreign invest3nent.
All these factors will tend to increase the flow of business visitors
to Indonesia and probably also the number of foreign businessmen, tech-
nicians and officials resident in the country. As noted above, these
business visitors and residents will constitute an important market for
Bali and a market strengthened rather than impaired by the energy
crisis.
114.      In summary, it seems clear that the tourism market for Bali
is likely to be very diversif;ied and consequently dependable. The fact
that Bali draws a sizable share of visitors from five different markets,
i.e. the U.S., Western Europe, Japan, Australia and the neighboring
countries of Southeast Asia and relies on three very distinct market
segments is at least a partial insurance against a major adverse change
in likely demand growth because of the energy crisis. As noted, each
market segment has some counterbalancing factors in case of a decline
in overall international tourist flows.
15.       An additional factor which could be important in the develop-
ment of future tourism demand is the air access policy that will be
adopted by the Government of Indonesia regarding Bali. In bilateral
negotiations on air traffic rights, the Government is seeking a substan-
tial share of the air traffic to Bali for the national airline, Garuida.
As part of this effort, the Government has informed foreign airlines
serving Bali that they will not be permitted to use Bali as a terminat-
ing point in Indonesia; if a terminating point is desired, it wDuld have
to be Jakarta.  Airlines serving Bali on through flights, such as Singapore/
Bali/Sydney, would not be affected.1/ The Government has not announced any
intention to apply such restrictions to charter flights, but has indicated
that it would encourage joint ventures and pooling arrangements betlween
Garuda and foreign airlines. The Indonesian authorities are curren-tly
reviewing these questions in order to find solutions which would permit
Indonesia to tap its promising tourism market while safeguarding the
interests of the national airline.
Demand Projections
16.       Given the above demand characteristics and likely trends of
future visitor traffic in view of the likely impact of the energy
crisis, it is projected that Bali as a whole would receive 287,000
foreign visitors in 1978, when the first hotels at Nusa Dua are sched-
uled to open, and 540,000 by 1983 when all 2,500 hotel rooms will be in
operation. These estimates are based on the assumption that the nuumber
of foreign visitor arrivals to Bali would grow at an average annual rate
of 26% from 1973-1977. Because of the higher absolute number of visitors
and a gradual elimination of repressed demand, it is assumed that the
growth rate would decline during the subsequent six-year period of 1978-
1983 to 14%. The average annual growth rate during 1973-1983 is assu-med
to be 19%.
1/ As a result of this policy, two airlines have disecntinued flights to
Bali; three other major air carriers, however, continue to serve Bali
on through flights.



Annex IX
Page 6
17.       The projections are considered reasonable in the light of the
following:
(i) Foreign visitor arrivals in Indonesia as a whole
increased by 52% annually in recent years. With the
elimination of the acute shortage of hotel space in
Bali, which.resulted in a repression of demand during
1969-73, a much higher growth rate than 26% might have
been expected in the absence of the energy crisis;
(ii) There would be a reduction by about one-third in the
real rates of growth of GNP and disposable income in
Western Europe, the U.S. and Japan during 1973-80.
The effect of this slowing down of disposal income
growth and possible changes in fares and exchange
rates on the number of foreign tourists visiting
Southeast Asia (as members of multiple-stop group
tours), might be more than proportional which is
consistent with past experience that tourism expen-
ditures abroad are highly income and price elastic.
Bali's inclusion in an increasing number of these group
tours would, however, limit the impact of this slowdown
on the tourist demand for Bali;
(iii) The Australian vacation market for whom Bali is often
a single destination would be relatively less affected
than the multiple-stop tour group market from Japan,
Europe and the United States and would continue to grow
at a relatively rapid rate;
(iv) The number of business travellers to Indonesia who might
also visit Bali would grow at least as rapidly as in the
past in light of increased business travel to Indonesia
resulting from the energy crisis (see para 2 (iii) above).
18.       In the light of the possibility that the energy crisis might have
a more significant impact on the tourism markets for Bali than the above,
three alternative projections of market demand have been made for the period
1978-1983/85. All of them assume that demand in the next four years,
1974-77 will increase by only 17% annually rather than at a rate of 26% as
stated above or a much higher rate (40-50%) which might well have been the
case in the absence of the energy crisis.
19.       The reduction of the likely growth rate in demand to 17% reflects
the assumption that the full effect of a marked slowing down in the growth
of travel to Southeast Asia from Japan, Western Europe and North America
would make itself felt in Bali, without being offset by the compensating
factors noted previously.

21.       Alternative Projections I and II assume that the number of foreign
visitor arrivals to Bali will increase to 540,000 by 1983 as in the basic
projection, reflecting a relatively rapid and vigorous recovery of the rate
of growth of visitor traffic following the much slower growth during the
1973-1977 period. This would imply an annual average growth rate of 20%
f7or 1978-1983 as compared to an average annual growth rate of only 14% for
the basic projection. Alternative II represents a modification of Alter-
rtative I in that it assumes a more rapid recovery of demand.
22.       Alternative III, assumes that it will take demand longer to
recover from the relative setback caused by the energy crisis so that a
total visitor traffic of 540,000 will only be reached two years later, in
1985 and the average growth rate for the 1978-85 period will be only 15%.,
fHotel Development
23.         Through the expansion of existing and the construction of new
hotels the number of internationally acceptable rooms increased to about
1,050 ty March 1974, when the PATA workshop was held in Bali, as compared



Annex IX
Page 8
to L50 prior to November 1973. During the subsequent three years, another
50o to 600 rooms are scheduled for completion, bringing the overall total
to 1,600 rooms which is the limit on internationally acceptable acconmoda-
tion outside Nusa Dua set by the Indonesian authorities.  This limit was
established by a preliminary agreement between the Indonesian authorities
and the World Bank Group in the interests of a planned and orderly devel-
opment of Bali's tourism. The Nusa Dua project will provide approximately
another 2,500 rooms during the period 1978-83. The following table shows
the most likely annual buildup of hotel capacity at Nusa Dua reflecting
the repressed demand for hotel accorimiodation and the consequent-strong
interest already shown by both foreign and Indonesian investors and hotel
operators in the development of accommodation facilities at Nusa Dua (see
para 27).

24.       The "basic" projectiorn of a 26% annual growth in foreign visitor
arrivals in Bali during the next: four years 1974-77 would result in average
annual occupancy rates in the hotels outside Nusa Dua of 65% in 1974, rising
to 70% by 1976 and 75% by 1977. ThLe alternLative projection of an annual
growth rate of only 17% during t:he same period, would lead to 50% occupancy
during 1974 and 1975 and 55% in the subsequent two years. The lower occu-
pancy of hotels outside Nusa DuaL unLder the alternative projections might
induce the potential hotel investors in Nusa Dua to modify the phasing
of the build-up of hotel rooms. Mcoreover, it is assumed that they will
adjust the phasing in accordance with the varying assumptions concerning
growth of demand during 1978-83/85 presented in para 20 above.
25.       The following table shows four possible phasings of hotel develop-
ment in Nusa Dua corresponding to the "basic" and the three alternative
demand projections.  It also shows the assumptions regarding average annual
room occupancies.

Expected Profitability
26.       The occupancy levels would, of course, determine the potential
profitability of hotel operations. A projection of the gross operating
Rrofits for hotels in the Nusa Dua resort is given in Table 8
assuming occupancy rates ranging from 55% to 75%. According to these
estimates, the gross operating profits on 2,500 hotel rooms when the resort
is in full operation would result in a return of about 15% on the capital
invested in hotels, after allowing for the charges to be made for utilities
and other services to be provided at the resort. After deducting land-lease
payments, management fees, and depreciation charges, the return on total
capital invested would amount to about 12%. The return on equity would,
of course, depend both on the capital structure of the investor and on the
terms and conditions of debt financing; on any reasonable assumption regard-
ing terms and conditions of loans, however, the return on equity should
prove attractive.

Investors' Interest
27.       The .interest already indlicated by investors supports the con-
clusion that prospects for hotel investment are favorable in view of the
market demand even under adverse conditions and because of the expecta-
tion of relatively high profitability of future hotel operations in Bali.
Among investors and hotel operators from whom the Indonesian authorities
have received strong indications of interest are the foll;owing: an
Indonesian group of investors rith links to the country's oil. industry
in association with Hilton International as potential operators; the
Southeast Asia franchise holders of:Ramada Inns; Travelodge 'and another
Australian group associated with M4enzies hotels; four Japanase groups
of investors and hotel operators including a subsidiary of .Japan Airlines
in partnership with Indonesian investors, the Club Mediterranee through
C. Itoh, its Japanese associate anc. a Singapore .group. Some. of these
investors have tentatively chosen specific sites within the estate area
and are now awaiting an early clarification of lease terms and other
conditions for investing in the area. Negotiations with potential in-
vestors would conmmence once the financial plans of the project are com-
plete, final designs are initiatedL, BTDC has formulated a definite set
of policies, and after proposals of hotel investors and operators have
been carefully reviewed with respect to the reputation of the firms,
their financial capability and their market connections. During nego-
tiations it was agreed that, until 1985, the Government would continue
to limit the number of internationally acceptable hotel rooms outside
Nusa Dua to 1,600, subject to periodic review of the limit by the Govern-
ment and the Association.

APPRAISAL OF THE BALI TOURISM PROJECT
The Balinese Economy
Introduction
1.        The economy of Bali may be sunmmarized as a traditional economic
system based on agriculture.  About 90% of the people live in rural areas
where village life is characterized by cooperative associations resulting
from a strong orientation to non-economic activities--religion, dances
and ritual. At present, the outside world has made only a slight impact
on this traditional organization of the economy.
2.        Per capita income in Bali has been estimated at between US$50-.
70 in 1971. Monetary indicators, however, are not likely to be an ade-
quate measure of the Balinese standard of living, since much economic
activity is not based on money transactions, but rather on cooperative
effort and the sharing of income in kind.
Population Characteristics
3.        The population numbers approximately 2.2 million, with an an-
nual growth rate of about 2.1%. As a result of rapid population growth
since World War II, nearly 49% of the population is under the age of
20.  The average density is about 360 persons per km2, but actual dis-
tribution is uneven due to the dependence on good agricultural land.
In irrigated areas, the density ranges from 700-1,000 persons per kn2,
with over half of the population on a quarter of the land.  There are
over 3,000 villages, and only a few urban areas such as Denpasar (popu-
lation less than 100,000). About 10% of the population is classed as
urban. Over 95% of the people are Hindus, the remainder Moslems,
Buddhists, and Christians.
Sectoral Output and Employment
4.        Both output and employment are predominantly agricultural.
Total agricultural land is about 390,000 ha., 100,000 ha. of which is
irrigated with another 110,000 in plantations, 65,000 in coconuts,
25,000 in coffee and 90,000 in dry crops. About 70% of the plots are
less than 1 ha., with actual owners working 73% of the plots.
5.        With the exception of ploughing--where cattle are used--all
work is done by hand without the help of mechanization. Work is done
largely through cooperative organizations. In irrigated areas, the
strongest association is the Subak which controls and coordinates the
use of irrigation water. In addition to farming, there is some live-
stock breeding--cattle and hogs--as well as poultry raising. Fishing

is relatively unimportant.
D.        There is, at present, no extractive or heavy industry in Bali.
Existing light industry involves import substitution and the processing
of basic agricultural products. Of the less than 5,000 people emplcyed
in light industry, 2,300 are employed in the one packing house and the
copra and cigarette factories and another 1,500 in the two cloth mills
and one spinning mill. More important, in terms of employment, is the
handicraft industry. Production is oriented to satisfying the needs of
a tradition--bound economy: building materials (such as bricks),
weaving, pottery, basket making, iron and silver works, wood and stone
sculpture, roof thatching, etc.
7.        A relative breakdown by sector of total output and employment
for 1968-69 is shown below:l/
Sector      % of Actual Population       % of GDP

100.0                  100
8.        External trade is rather limited.  Some necessary agricultural
products and equipment are imported, while raw agricultural products are
exported.
Growth Prospects: Agriculture
9.        If past trends continue,2/agricultural output may be expected
to increase roughly in proportion to the increase in population. Con-
tinued expansion of agricultural output on Bali, however, will have to
be based primarily on higher value crops and improved physical inputs
(seeds, fertilizer, water, etc.), rather than on greater labor utiliza-
tion which is already relatively hiigh. This is particularly true given
the very limited scope for increasing the amount of land under cultiva-
tion. Under these circumstances, rural underemployment (disguised un-
employment) is likely to increase over the long term, unless, of course,
non-agricultural sectors develop in rural areas or significant numbers
of people choose to migrate to urban centers or other less populated
islands.
10.       Obviously, rural-urban migration would only contribute to the
existing level of urban unemployment which has already become somewhat

of a problem in towns such as Denpasar. What is needed is a rapid
expansion of non-agricultural sectors capable of absorbing both the
urban unemployed and rural underemployed. An important aspect of this
problem is that increased educational opportunities have resulted in a
growing number of young people whose interests have been diverted from
traditional activities, but who have not yet found employment in non-
traditional sectors of the economy.
Growth Prospects: Non-agricultural
11.       While large scale industrial development is unlikely to occur
in the near future, there appear to be good prospects for the expansion
of food processing and other light industrial production. Increases
in construction will depend largely on the level of investment in in-
frastructure works and hotels such as the Nusa Dua project, and in the
general expansion of industrial and commercial activity. Expansion of
the handicraft sector will depend. upon both increases in local popula-
tion and, increasingly, the growth of tourism.
12.       The tourism sector itself can have a significant impact in
t'erms of both the development of non-traditional employment opportuni-
ties and the development of a growing market for local goods and ser-
vices. With respect to expanding the tourist consumption of local ag-
ricultural output, there is a definite need for technical assistance
in order to encourage improvement in both the quantity and quality of
local products. (Such assistance is provided for in the Nusa Dua
project loan, See Annex XII). With limited growth prospects for most
other non-agricultural sectors in the near future, and with a likely
decline in the labor-absorption capacity of agricultural expansion,
tourism development clearly merits significant attention in Government
plans for regional development in the case of Bali.

APPRAISAL OF THE BALI TOURISM PROJECT
Economic JuLstification
Introduction
i.        For purposes of economic evaluation, the total proposed program
of investments has been divided into two parts: (a) the tourism resort
area investment program, and (b) the roads component outside of the pro-
ject area.
2.        The tourism resort area investments (both public and private)
include jite development and infrastructure works for the Nusa Dua resort
complex,1/construction of about 2,500 hotel rooms and related superstruc-
ture, a training school for hotel employees, improvements in the villages
of Bualu and Benoa and technical assistance to the BTDC and the BTDB for
improving the distribution of benefits from tourism and encouraging op-
timal development of the tourism sector on Bali. The cost of these in-
vestments amounts to about US$86.0 million,/ and represents 90.4% of the
total proposed development program. The tourism resort area investments
are evaluated in paras. 5 to 24 below.
3.        The roads component outside of the resort area includes the
improvement of about 199 kms. of existing roads which connect the tour-
ist resort areas in southern Bali_./to the major tourist attractions
north of Denpasar, and construction of a by-pass road around the city
of Denpasar. While these road connections are an essential ingredient
in the development of tourism facilities in southern Bali, the actual
volume of tourism related traffic on these roads--as compared with pri-
vate and other commercial traffic--would be rather small (10-15% at
most). Consequently, the largest part of road user benefits would alc-
crue to the local population and, for this reason, the roads component
outside of the project area is evaluated on the basis of standard rate
of return calculations for a roads project. The cost of these road im-
provements amounts to about US$9. 1million,4/and represents 9.6% of the
total proposed program of investments. The roads component is evaluated
below in paras. 25-33.
1/ Including the access road from the airport to the project site and the
electricity investments to be financed with British Aid.
2/ Excludingprice contingencies. Hotel investment costs are assumzed to
average about US$25,000 per room, exclusive of land.
3/ Including Sanur, Kuta and Nusa Dua.
4/ Excluding price contingencies.

4.        The balance of paymernts impact, employment effects and Govern-
ment tax revenues resulting from the total proposed program of invest-
ments are dealt with in paras. 34-40.
Tourism Project Costs and Benefits
5.        The gross benefits resulting from the tourism resort area com-
ponents of the project would be the expenditures in Bali of tourists who
stay at the Nusa Dua hotel complex. Because of the rather severe shor-
tage of acceptable accommodation in the major tourist destinations in
Indonesia, the Nusa Dua hotel visitors would represent previously un-
tapped demand, including both the expansion of tour-group visitors and
the inducement to business travelers to extend their stay in Indonesia
long enough to take in the attractions of Bali. These benefits are,
therefore, incremental to Indonesia as a whole and do not represent a
diversion of traffic from existing destinations in Indonesia.  Although
some portion of the (net) revenues accruing to Indonesian airlines from
interrational tourist traffic is properly attributable to the project,
the actual share going to GarudLa will depend very much on the Government's
air-access policy which is currently under review. Because of this un-
certainty benefits from international travel .:ave not been taken into
account in calculating project rates of return. An important character-
istic of the expenditures of NtLsa Dua hotel guests is that 85-90% of them
will consist of foreign exchange.
6.        The relevant costs are the cEepital and operating costs of
the infrastructure provided under the iroposed project, and of the
hotel and related superstructure facilities of the resort, plus the
estimated capital and operating costs relating to the expenditures
of Nusa Dua hotel guests outside of the resort area (see para. 9).
The revenue and cost assumptions are explained below.
Revenue Assumptions
7.        While the proposed IDA credit relates primarily to the infra-
structure requirements of the Nusa Dua project, the complete develop-
ment of the resort will also include construction of hotels -and other
superstructure financed by the private sector. Hence, the economic
evaluation of the Nusa Dua project has been made in terms of this com-
plete development. Some of the facilities to be provided would serve
and be paid for directly by the tourists, while others would be com-
pensated for only indirectly. Accordingly, the costs and revenues must
be carefully analyzed so as to Avoid double counting.
8.        It is assumed that expenditures by Nusa Dua hotel guests would
not differ substantially from the expenditures of current hotel guests
of the Bali Beach and other comparable hotels of an international stamn-
dard on Bali. The current average daily expenditures have been estima-
ted on the basis of known patterns of tourist expenditures--by category



ANNEX XI
Page 3
of expense--and the current prices for each of these categories of vis-
itor spending.  On this basis, the combined average daily expenditure
of tourists in the Nusa Dua hotels would be about US$46.00, and would
be distributed as follows: hotels ($27.30), including sales taxes
($2.40); shopping ($8.00); tours and transportation ($6.00); and enter-
tainment and recreation ($4.70).
9.        In projecting gross revenues from hotel guests at Nusa Dua it
is assumed that the average length of stay would be about 3.5 days. As
new hotels come on stream, they are expected to achieve first year room
occupancies of about 55%, rising to 75% by the third year of operations.i/
The number of overnights has been calculated on the basis of 1.7 persons
per room. Revenues within the Nusa Dua complex would include all of the
expenditures by guests on food and acconmodation and some portion of the
guest spending on shopping, erntertainment and recreation. The expendi-
tures on tours and transportation, plus the balance of the shopping, en-
tertainment and recreation expenditures would relate primarily to capital
and operating expenses incurred outside of the resort area. Investment
costs for non-hotel superstructure facilities have been estimated at
approximately US$1.0 million.
Cost Assumptions
10.       Economic costs of operating the superstructure facilities are
derived from the projected financial accounts of hotels, restaurants and
other facilities, which in turn are based on actual experience of simi-
lar facilities elsewhere on Bali. In the case of revenue earning infra--
structure (such as electricity, water and sewerage), the gross revenues
have been projected on the basis of expected consumption by the hotels
and other superstructure facilities, and the gross operating profits
of these infrastructure units has been counted as a benefit in justify-
ing the related investments. The projection of utility charges in the
operating costs of the superstructure facilities has been carefully
matched with the projected gross revenues of the utilities.
11.       The projected operating and maintenance costs of the non-
revenue earning infrastructure items (such as internal roads and streets,
street lighting and landscape maintenance) haveL been included in the
calculation of operating and maintenance costs,for the project operating
unit--BTDC. Investment costs, operating costs and gross revenues are
all calculated in 1973 prices.
Gross Operating Profits
12.       The gross operating profits resulting from the main categories
of visitor expenditures are shown below for a typical operating year:_/
1/ The schedule of hotel openings are based on market projections dis-
cussed ir Annex IX.
2/ In this case, the "typical year" for the complex as a whole begins in
1985, since some hotels would not reach their projected occupancy levels
until then (figures are in 1973 prices).

13.       Individual sub-components of the project have varying economic
lives, but as a whole it is estimated that the project would have   an
economic life of about 25 years. For purposes of calculating the inter-
nal rate of return, the need to make modest provision for some replace-
ment expenditures during this period would be offset by the life of the
main assets beyond 25 years.
Shadow Price Considerations
11.       The acquisition costs of land have been reviewed and are con-
sidered to reflect reasonably accuLrately the economic value of land in
terms of alternative uses.  In light of recent developments concerning
Indonesia's oil exports, and the dLegree of uncertainty regarding the
(short-term) domestic impact of sizable increases in net oil revenues,
it has not been possible to estimate the shadow exchange rate which might
b e appropriate over the life of thLe project. Accordingly., rate of return
caiculations are based on the existing official exchange rate. Given the
extent of unemployment and undeir-employment in Bali, the opportunity cost
of labor in terms of output foregcne in other sectors, is likely to be
lower than wage rates for emplcoyees of the resort.  Hence, while actual
wage levels have been used in calculating the basic economic return, two
additional rates of return have been calculated to test the project's
sensitivity to shadow wages 15% anLd 30% below actual wages (see para.22).
Cost-Benefit Streams

project are summarized below:

Internal Rate of Return
16.       Based on the above assumptions, the internal economic rate of
return on the tourism resort program of investments would be 18.7%. The
sensitivity of the rate of return to alternative assumptions regard:ing
costs and benefits is tested below.
17.       It is expected that foreign investors will be interested in
building hotels at Nusa Dua. Assuming that two-thirds of the hotel
rooms would be financed from abroad, the rate of return on the purely
domestically financed investmentl (including the IDA credit, but exclu-
ding both the foreign private investment and the net repayments and
other returns accruing to foreigners) would be 23.1%. This is partiLy
because foreign hotel investors would not participate in those benefits
of the project arising from tourist expenditures outside the hotels and
would receive an after-tax return on their investment somewhat lower than
the project's overall rate of return--thus raising the share and the rate
of return accruing to domestic capital (including the IDA-financed por-
tion). It is also partly a result of the ability of the tourism estate
corporation and the Government authorities to recover from the hoteLs the
full costs of the utilities and other in1frastructure provided under the
project. If the expected foreign private investment were avaii7able only
for this tourism project, without any impact whatsoever on the amount
and terms of foreign capital available for the rest of the economy, then
the return on domestic investment (including the IDA credit) would be the
relevant one to consider. If, on the other hand, the private foreign in-
vestment in tourism were part of a foreign capital pool-available to the



ANNEX XI
Page 6
whole Indonesian economy, fully determined in respect to its size and
terms, then clearly the relevant consideration would be the return on
the overall investment. The foreign share would then be part of the
overall resource pool under Indonesia's command, over which it must
maximize returns. Presumably, the true situation is intermediate be-
tween these two extremes; some of the private foreign investment in
tourism may not be available for other projects, but it does influence
the amount of other capital inflows, and its terms.  However, as the
returns both on the overall project and on the Indonesian funds invested
in it (including IDA funds) are quite satisfactory, the project is ac-
ceptable under any reasonable assumption about its impact on capital
inflowE to the Indonesian economy.
'i sCibuTion of Benefits

which will be generated by the project in a typical operating year (1985):

19.       The economic return cn the overall investment in the project
(18.7%) represents a consolidation of different rates of return for various
agencies, enterprises and individuals. The return to government (17.7%)
includes both the operating income of the BTDC and the rather substantial
receipts from sales and corporate income taxes.j/ The economic return on
hotel operations, which require sizable amounts of new capital investment,
would be about 12%. Tourist expenditures outside the resort complex for
handicrafts, art works and entertainment, which mainly benefit the Balinese
craftsmen and village associations, are likely to be highly renumerative
because of the minimal new capital investments required.
1/The Government of Indonesia would receive the net income of the BTDC
plus corporate income taxes from the hotels and other superstructure.
Local governments would receive sales taxes on tourist expenditures.

Net Benefits Without the Project
20.        The Nusa Dua infrastructure project represents part of an
overall effort to control the future development of tourism on Bali,
ln order to minimize potentially harmful effects on the cultural and
physical environment and to maximize the net benefits to the economy
of tourist expenditures. Both of these goals are furthered by the
concentration of hotel development on the Bukit peninsula, away from
the major population centers and agricultural areas, in an integrated
resort complex. Management of this estate by a wholly government-owned
corporation will ensure not ohly that the costs of utility and other
services are fully borne by the ultimate consumer, but also that the
benefits from increased land values due to the government investments
in infrastructure and the development of the area do not accrue to
private investors.
21.       It is possible that without the Nusa Dua estate project a
substantial expansion of accommodation capacity wuld still take place
elsewhere in Bali over the next ten years. The pattern of this ex-
pansion, however, would undoubtedly be more dispersed, and its planning
generally uncoordinated and haphazard. As a result, this alternative
would generate substantially higher social and economic costs because
of (i) the diversion of sizeable areas of first-class rice land to non-
agricultural use, as compared with the rather low opportunity cost of
land at Nusa Dua; (ii) infrastructure costs which might well be higher
than at Nusa Dua because of the absence of economies of concentration
in hotel development, and (iii) greatly reduced Government control over
the impact of tourism development and a correspondingly higher risk of
significant environmental damage, as well as a more pervasive and nega-
tive impact on the cultural life of the Balinese communities.
22.       With respect to the gross benefits from this alternative de--
velopment of accommodation capacity, it is not clear whether, through
unplanned and scattered hotel expansion, anything like the 2,500 inter-
national quality hotel rooms envisaged for Nusa Dua would be built by
1983.  If fewer rooms are available, or if the size of hotels and the
standards of quality are unacceptable for the group-tour market, it is
doubtful whether either the projected gross benefits or the projected
foreign exchange earnings and employment creation would be achieved.
23.       Given the higher social and economic costs of dispersed
tourism development, and the potentially lower gross benefits if the
quantity or quality of projected hotel rooms is reduced, the economic
rate of return on the Nusa Dua hotel development would be clearly
higher than for the alternative case. What is not clear, however,
is whether this "without" case actually represents a viable alterna-
tive in terms of the longer-term development of tourism in Bali.
While the higher social costs relating to cultural and environmental
damage are difficult to quantify, continued haphazard development of
tour-ism might well lead to the eventual destruction of the very assets
which are the foundation of the tourist industry in Bali.

a/ As discussed in Annex IX, Market Demand and Hotel Development.,
The Roads Component Costs and Benefits
4).       The roads component outside of the project area consists of two
items: (a) improvements of eleven multipurpose roads connecting the resort
areas in southern Bali with the major tourist attractions north of Denpasar,
and (b) construction of a by-pass road around the city of Denpasar. Justi-
fication of these investments on tourism grounds must be viewed in the
context of the Tourism Master Plan for Bali. This plan calls for con-
centration of future hotel developments at Nusa Dua, a site at the extreme
southern tip of Bali on the Bukit peninsula, in order not to be disruptive
of other economic activities ancd to prevent further deterioration of the
cultural and environmental assets of the island. In view of this concen-
tration of hotels in a relativeLy isolated area, an improvement in the
geographic distribution of the benefits from tourist expenditures depends
crucially on the improvement of road connections between the resort areas
in southern Bali and the tourist attractions and villages north of Denpasar.
Similarly, the viability of the Nusa Dua estate in the early years of
development depends, at least in part, on the maintenance of a limit on
hotel expansion outside of Nusa Dua.  This limit, in turn, hinges on the
locational competitiveness of the Nusa Dua site as compared with the Sanur

rates, average daily expenditures and operating costs.

and Kuta Beach sites. The by-pass route around Denpasar will contribute,
significantly toward making the Nusa Dua site competitive for hotel in-
vestors in terms of the accessibility of the tourist attractions north
of the city.
26.       As indicated in the introduction, the relatively low volume of
tourism traffic on the by-pass and on the multipurpose roads--as compare.d
with commercial and other private vehicular traffic--argues for a separate
justification of the roads component. Accordingly, rates of return cal-
culated on the basis of vehicle operating cost savings are given below.
In light of the importance of these roads for tourism development, however,
an additional rate of return was calculated for the tourism-related in-
vestment program, in which the tourism project was burdened with the ful.l
investment costs of roads outside the resort area. The overall rate of
return on the project on this basis would be 17.0%.
Multipurpose Roads Improvement
27.       As part of a general survey of transport requirements for Bali,
the Indonesian Highway Department has reviewed the need for improved road
connections in light of the potential development of agricultural,
commercial and tourism activity on the island. A total of 640 kms.
covering 18 sections of various roads was proposed for inclusion in the
tourism project. After careful review of the existing and potential
transport requirements of the tourism sector, a total of 199 kms. covering
11 roads was selected by the Mission for inclusion in the tourism infra-
structure project.
28.       No major changes are proposed in the existing alignment of
these roads. Improvements consist of upgrading the road surfaces, minor
realignment of curves and the replacement of inadequate and potentially
dangerous bridges. The replacement of bridges is a particularly important
aspect of the improvement, and comprises over 50% of total improvement
costs. Existing bridges are single lane structures of 3-ton capacity
design which were built 40-50 years ago, and are today both inadequate
and unsafe.1/
29.       The Indonesia Highway Department prepared estimates of the costs
and benefits for each of the roads they had proposed, with rates   of
return well above 15% on average. These estimates have been reviewed
in light of subsequent changes proposed during project appraisal, as
follows: (i) the roads selected for inclusion in the project do not
correspond precisely to the sections on which the Highway Department
proposed rates of return, but rather comprise the most essential
sections of these roads; (ii) investment cost estimates assumed by the
Highway Department were based on 7 m. width (requiring a doubling of
the existing road surface), while the current cost estimates--and
1/ Trucks now using these bridges are frequently much in excess of 3 tons;
collapse of a single bridge carrying a bus-load of tourists would
have a most unfortunate effect on tourism development in Bali.



ANNEX XI

the actual project design--will be based on about half that width,
(i.e. resurfacing existing widths.); and (iii) over 50% of the estima-
ted total investment cost involves the replacement of bridges which are
currently both inadequate and unsafe, and which therefore could be as-
sumed to be justified separate:Ly. While the Highway Department estim-
ate of road user benefits was significantly over-estimated, a more
realistic estimate of benefits, combined with substantially reduced
investment costs, would yield rates of return of about 20% on average.
East Denpasar By-Pass Road
30.       As both the provincial capital and the largest town in Bali,
Denpasar is the center of governmental and commercial activities on
the island. The total population was estimated in 1970 to be about
90,000 people, with a growth rate of over 4% per year between 1961-70.
Much of this growth was the result of in-migration in response to in-
creased economic activity. Population density reached approximately
3,200 persons per km2 in 1971.
31.       As a result of increases in both population and economic ac-
tivity, local traffic on the main thoroughfares of the city has in-
creased rapidly. In additiorq )o local traffic, however, Denpasar serves
as the hub of a road networkI/connecting (a) the airport at Tuban with
the hotels in the Sanur area, 1'b) the hotels of Kuta beach and Sanur
(and the proposed resort at Nusa Dua) with the major tourist attractions
north of Denpasar, (c) northern agricultural areas with Sanur, Kuta,
Tuban and the port of Benoa, anud (d) villages all over the island with
the city of Denpasar itself.
32.       The channeling of the resultant traffic flows through the
main streets of Denpasar has caused a rapid increase in traffic con-
gestion which, in turn, has extended travel time, raised vehicle opera-
ting costs and contributed significantly to the deterioration of the
urban environment in Denpasar. In order to eliminate this bottleneck,
the project would include a by-pass road arourd the city.
33.       Two alternative routes for the by-pass (east and west) were
examined by the Indonesian Highway Department.  In each case, the
(discounted) costs of construct-ion and maintenance were calculated and
compared with the estimated (discounted) benefits to road users over a
20-year period. With a discount rate of 20%, the benefit/cost ratio
for the east by-pass was estimatedl to b? 1.96, significantly higher than,
for the west by-pass. Wheile this                       d significant over-
estimation of road user benefit-s, the revised investment cost estimates
are somewhat lower, and the by-pass would still yield a rate of return
of about 15%. This rate of return does not include the benefits
which would accrue to the inhabitants of Denpasar in terms of an im-
proved urban environment resulting from the decrease in traffic conges-
tion.

Balance of Payments and Employment Impact
34.         The proposed project is expected to increase gross foreign
exchange earnings by about US$10.7 million in 1978 when the first hotels
open and by US$48.1 million per year from 1985 when all of the hotels will
have achieved their projected normal occupancy levels. This compares with
an estimated US$50 million earned by tourism in Indonesia in 1973.
35.         Of the total expenditures by Nusa Dua resort guests, over 85%
would represent foreign exchange revenue. Hotel income has been calcu-
lated on the basis of net tour operator prices for group tours, and for-
eign exchange revenue from international air travel has been excluded
from the estimate of gross foreign exchange earnings.
36.       The import component of operating costs for hotels and res-
taurants has been reviewed and is estimated to be about 40% currently.
By 1985, with improvements in the local supply of agricultural and
other products, the import component is expected to decline to about
30%.
37.       In addition to imported operating supplies, the tourism resort
development will result in foreign exchange outflow due to hotel manage-
ment contracts, debt service on foreign hotel loans and dividends to
foreign hotel investors. These management and capital costs are estim-
ated to be about US$0.1 million in 1978 when the first hotels open,
rising to US$5.7 million from 1985 onward. Debt service on the IDA
credit would be about US$0.4 million from 1985.
38.       On the basis of the foreign exchange revenues and costs es-
timated above, the net foreign exchange earnings of the Nusa Dua pro--
ject would amount to US$8.5 million in 1978; and would rise to US$36.2
million from 1985 onward., This may be compared with an estimated for-
eign exchange component of the infrastructure project of US$18.1 mil-
lion including price contingencies, and the estimated foreign exchange
component of superstructure of about US$ 25.0 million.
39.       Assuming a ratio of 2.0 employees per room, the hotels on Nusa
Dua would generate about 5000 new jobs by 1983. Additional jobs created
in restaurants, shops, tour agencies, entertainment and recreational
facilities and the BTDC would amount to about 800-1000 new positions, for
a total increase in direct employment of 5,800-6,000 persons. Indirect
employment is more difficult to estimate but, on the basis of tourist
expenditures on art and handicraft items in the shops, it is possible
that another 3,700 jobs would be created for artists and handicraft
workers. At the same time, agriculturalists are likely to shift some
of their current production into higher quality, higher value crops
for tourist consumption which would generate both higher agricultural
income and, because of the greater labor intensity of high quality
vegetable cultivation, would also generate some additional employment
for farm workers. Given the extent of underemployment in the agricul-
tural sector, however, no estimate has been made of the number of new
jobs which this would entail.

Government Tax Revenues
40.       In addition to the net income generated by the wholly govern-
ment-owned Bali Tourism Development Corporation, the Indonesian authori-
ties will collect corporate income taxes from the hotels amounting to
about US$1.5 million in 1985 and over $2.0 million annually after 1990.
Local governments will collect sales tax revenues, based on a 10% tax
on hotel and restaurant sales, aiounting to about UJS$0.7 million in 197,
rising to US$2.8 million from 1985 onward.

APPRAISAL OF THE BALI TOURISM PROJECT
The Social Impact of Tourism
Introduction
1.        The purpose of this Annex is threefold:  (a) to define the
basic issues involved in assessing the social impact of tourism in
Bali; (b) to examine the most important social effects of tourism de-
velopment in Bali up to the present time; and (c) to review the means
by which the negative social effects of tourism can be minimized, and
the positive effects maximized, in the context of the proposed Bank
tourism project at Nusa Dua.
Basic Issues
2.        The primary attractions of Bali for the foreign visitor may
be grouped into two broad classifications--man-made or cultural attrac-
tions and natural or scenic attractions. Under the former category
fall the diverse and unique art forms--music, dance, painting and
sculptures--as well as a variety of religious influences which are
deeply ingrained in the way of life of the people and are expressed
in Hindu-Balinese temples, festivals and handicraft items. Included
among the natural and scenic attractions are rugged volcanic peaks--
some of which still erupt periodically--dense tropical forest, lush,
green terraced rice paddies and white sand beaches flanked by groves
of palm trees and washed by blue green waters which conceal coral reefs
and tropical sea life of great beauty.
3.        Combined with a tropical climate which invites--if not demands--
a relaxed and casual approach of life, it is small wonder that the delights
of Bali have been enjoyed for many decades by a very small but hardy group
of world travellers. And yet, as the number of such visitors increases--
from 95,000 in 1973 to an estimated 540,000 by 1983--the possibility of
serious deleterious effects on the cultural and environmental assets of
Bali may be expected to increase correspondingly.
4.       Tourism development in any country will invariably bring with
it a number of potentially negative effects in terms of both cultural
changes and environmental deterioration. In order to minimize these



ADNEX XII
Page 2
negative effects in the development of tourism on Bali, the Government
of Indonesia, with the assistance of IDA and several consulting groups,
has attempted to anticipate potential problems and to formulate and
implement carefully planned Eolutions.  (See below paras. 28-33).
Assuming that the negative effect of tourism can be controlled,
il may be expected that the positive effects--in terms of increased in-
comes, employment and foreign exchange earnings--would result in an
overall impact which, on balance, is desirable.
6.        The comparison of these social costs and benefits involves a
classic trade-off between increased incomes and cultural and environ-
mental change. Even if the negative impact of tourism is minimized,
there will still be changes in the way of life of the people and in
their physical setting which are extremely difficult--if not impossi-
ble-:-to quantify. Certain value judgments are, therefore, inescapable.
Where the current level of inccme and employment is sufficiently low,
however, the "way of life" cannot be divorced from the "standard of
living"--and the prospects for economic development must be weighed
accordingly.
7.        There is one further question which is relevant in defining
the basic social issues involved in tourism development in Bali. That
question is: What would happen to the culture and physical environment
in Bali in the absence of a major tourism development program? Or,
put another way, would the prohibition of further tourism growth in
Bali serve to protect and preserve the cultural and environmental heri-
tage of the island? The answer is--not necessarily. There are many
other forces in Bali which have already had a significant impact on
life in certain areas. The city of Denpasar is a prime example, with
its blaring music, neon lights, the prestigious hondas and the throngs
which gather outside theaters exhibiting Indian films. In short, the
effects of tourism development should be distinguished from the effects
of urbanization which can bring about profound social and environmental
changes. In addition, however, there is the more pervasive influence
of "modernization": Not uncommton in Bali is the substitution of tile
or corregated tin for the traditional thatched roofs of elephant grass
or leaves of the sugar palm tree; in some temples "casette art" prevails
(instead of the traditional orchestra or the priest singing the sacred
hymns, there is a tape-recorded substitute); instead of the traditional
coconut shell with a burning cotton wick in coconut oil, temple lights
in .?majority of instances are now diesel fuelled lanterns or electric
li,ght bulbs; in a significant number oC religious ceremonies, the
ecoration-; are no longer wood or coconiut leaves, but plastic imita-
~.ions-_complete with aluminum offering bowls!
t9.       The simple fac-t is that the Haline2e culture, as expressed in
the way of life of the people, is not, and never has been static;
the-ir's is a living dynamic society which has for hundreds of years
adapted with remarkable flexibility to the forces of change.  Tourism
development represents only one such force, and it should be viewed
with that perspective in mind.



AiViFEX XII

The Social Impact of Tourism in Bali
9.        We should, perhaps, begin by noting that the people of Bali
have for many decades welcomed foreign tourists as guests. According
to a report by Mr. Raymond Naronha (a consultant anthropologist em-
ployed by IDA to study the social impact of tourism in Bali), "...all
of the Balinese interviewed--artists, hotel employees, students, villa-
gers, government servants, faculty members of the university, taxi
drivers and shopkeepers--did not regard tourists as a plague or a dis-
guised nuisance.  The Balinese love tourists and have displayed a re-
markable cultural resilience". Nonetheless, concern has been expressed
regarding the social impact of tourism in Bali.  At least four aspects
of this impact need to be considered: (a) the "demonstration effect"
of a large number of relatively wealthy foreign visitors; (b) the
effects of "commercialization" on Balinese art, handicrafts, music and
dance performances; (c) the impact of tourist behavior and numbers on
temple Life and religious ceremonies; and (d) the concentration of
benefits from the development of tourism.
A. The Demonstration Effect
IC).      If past experience may be relied upon, the demonstration ef-
fect of tourism is unlikely to poseimuch of a problem. The Balinese
people have evidenced a rather remarkable capacity for not being unduly
influenced by either the idiosyncracies or the excesses of their for-
eign guests. If anything, they are perhaps more likely to accept the
foreigner's behavior as inherently incomprehensible; their demonstrated
iack of enthusiasm for imitating that behavior is most probably based
on the view that it is inferior to their own. A prime example of thLis
is the Balinese abhorance of excess consumption. The most repulsi-ve
character in Balinese drama is the actor representing sloth and gluttorLy.
11.       Similarly, the obviously hectic schedule of a bus-load of
tourists attempting to "do" Bali in 2-3 days has a distinct lack of
appeal when compared with the relaxed way of life of the Balinese
people. If anything, we may hope for a kind of reverse demonstration
effect, with the tourists going away somewhat less enamored with their
previous approach to life, and perhaps more thoughtful about human
values. That, in fact, is part of the appeal of Bali for the foreign
visitor.
s. Commercialization of the Arts
Many local observers (purists especially) have complained
about a deterioration in the quality of the "arts" as a result of in-
creasing commercialization.  It should perhaps be noted, however, that
the complaint is hardly new, having been voiced as early as 1933 in a
book about Bali written by a noted Mexican anthropologist../ While it
1/ The Island of Bali, by M. Covarrubius



ANNEX XII
Page h
is difficult to be very precise about the extent of the problem, even the
most casual observer can detect a rather considerable range of quality
'n the handicraft goods now available in Bali. With respect to the nature
of goods offered, and the varietby and quality of cultural performances,
one must recognize the significance of the desires of the purchasing
public, whose tastes may be quite different from those of knowledgeable
local art critics.  In point of fact, it is not uncommon in any society
to find that the more classical art, forms go unappreciated by the major-
ity of the population, or that the "patrons of the arts" are confined
to a rather small group of wealthier individuals. This phenomenon is
compounded in the case of foreign tourists in Bali.  As patrons of
Balinese art--whether it be painting, sculpture, music or dancing--the
typical foreign visitor can hardly be expected to be a discerning critic
of a totally unfamiliar artistic expression.
13.       It is an equally unde:rstandable phenomenon for many Balinese
artists and performers to orient their efforts toward satisfying this
less discerning--and hence less demanding--foreign market. A related
concern of many local observers is that the artists and performers who
live near the major resort areas devote their time almost exclusively
to satisfying the demands of the foreign visitors, to the neglect of
ciassical art forms, while those artists and performers in the non-
tourist areas have ample time to devote to classical art, but lack the
necessary patronage to maintain and expand their skilLs.  This problem
is discussed further below in terms of the concentration of the benefits
from tourist expenditures.
C.  Tourism Effects on Temple LLfe and Religious Ceremonies
14.       There has been some concern expressed, primarily by outside
observers, about the behavior of foreign tourists in and around the
Balinese temples, particularly during significant religious ceremonies
and festivals. The Balinese themselves seem not to be particularly of-
fended by this behavior, demonstrating a rather more tolerant attitude
than might prevail in many other countries. It is not uncommon, how-
ever, for foreign visitors to be seen taking photographs, talking, or
otherwise indicating a regrettable lack of respect while attending re-
,ig-ous ceremonies in the temples._
It is, of course, unlikely that such behavior can be completely
cont rolled. Undoubtedly, a program of "cultural awareness" for arriving
vi,i3tors would help to sensitize tcourists to local customs, and might
prevent some of the more blatant forms of disrespectful behavior. In
the longer term, however, more stringent measures may become necessary.
As Luis Turner points out in a discussion of international tourism,2/
1, Some of the most significant ceremonies, of course, are closed to
outsiders.

Wang; (N.T., 1973).



ANNEX XII
Page 5
"a case can be made that there will be a critical point beyond which a
tourist industry becomes so big that it starts producing a significant
backlash in the host culture". Some countries, of course, Spain most
notably, have demonstrated a remarkable capacity to absorb foreign
tourists. And, in the short term, a certain amount of geographic con-
centration and proper coordination of tour group routes and schedules
can minimize the impact of increasing tourist flows.  Eventually, how-
ever, it may be necessary to consider limits on the number of tourist
arrivals which can be permitted on the Island of Bali.
16.       To place this consideration in a numerical perspective, the
following factors should be kept in mind.  In 1973, Bali received about
95,000 foreign tourists, as compared with the Island's population of
2.3 million people. By 1985, when the Nusa Dua project is fully opera-
tional, foeign tourist arrivals are projected to be in the neighborhood
of 550,000 per year, as compared with a population of 2.5-2.7 million
people--a ratio of about 1:5 (tourists to locils). By comparison, in
1971 with a population of about 34 million people, Spain received 25
million foreign tourists--a ratio of nearly 3:4. While the ratio of
foreign arrivals to local population is an important consideration, the
actual impact of the arrival numbers must be viewed in terms of the
average length of stay--which would determine the average number of
foreign tourists expected to be on Bali on any given day. In point of
fact, the average foreign tourist will stay only about 3A days in Bali.
With 550,000 arrivals, this would mean only about 5,000 foreign tourists
per day in Bali--or a ratio of 1:500 by 1984. While the average number
of foreign tourists per day would thus appear to be a manageable number,
there would still remain the problem of ensuring that all 5,000 visi-
tors do not attempt to visit the main temple areas at the same time.
17.       The issues relating to tourist arrivals, their tour routes
and schedules within Bali and their overall impact on the Balinese cul-
ture are clearly local issues, and they must be resolved locally. The
Bali Tourism Development Board (BTDB), described in Annex II, has been.
established by the Government specifically in order to coordinate the
development of tourism on the Island and to help ensure both that the
benefits of tourism are maximized and that the negative economic and
cultural effects are minimized.  The concern of the Indonesian Govern-
men" regarding the proper resolution of such issues was stated by
;resident Soeharto in November 1973 in an address at the opening cere-
mon, of the new Bali Hyatt Hotel:  "....if the aims of the build-up of
tourism are to fully support the national development, we should take
precautionary measures so that the flow of tourists to this country
will not weaken the values we regard as sacred. The regional culture
should be fully protected.  This has a special meaning for the people
of Bali, in that their famous arts and crafts are clearly related to
their spiritual life .... The decline in her originality and artistic
values--if we are not careful enough--may turn away the tourists from
this beautiful island".
18.       In order to support the efforts of the BTDB in formulating
and implementing appropriate regulatory and coordinating measures, the



ANNEX XII
Page 6
project would include technical. assistance funds for obtaining qualified
experts to assist the local authorities in this endeavor (See Annex II).l/
D. The Concentration of Tourism Benefits
19.       To a large extent, the problem of the concentration of benefits
from tourism might be considered more of an economic than a social prob-
lem. The social implications, however, cannot be ignored, as the atti-
tudes of the Balinese people toward foreign tourists in the long-run
will undoubtedly be influenced by the extent to which they participate
in the benefits from tourism development. By concentration of benefits
we refer both to the regional distribution of income and employment and
to the distribution of income between the workers, various middlemen,
and the owners of tourist facilities such as hotels, shops and tour
agencies.
20.       With respect to the regional distribution of income and employ-
ment, we have already noted the fact that artists and performers in the
major resort areas near Denpasar enjoy a preferred position in supplying
the tourist market for cultural goods and services. The same may be
said for hotel workers and tour guides. To a large extent, the problem
is related to a necessary trade-off between the concentration of the
resort facilities away from the major population centers and irrigated
rice growing areas--in order not to be disruptive of current social and
economic activity--and the dispersion of resort facilities in order to
expand the geographic distribution of benefits. Dispersion is, however,
limited by the relatively few good beaches available in Bali.   While
there are strong economic and social arguments in favor of concentra-
tion of resort facilities--particular in terms of the economies of
scale in the provision of basic infrastructure--there is also a need
to find ways of spreading tourism benefits more widely, perhaps by de-
velopment of a rationing system which would insure the outer-lying
villages of a fair share of the market for both handicraft goods and
cultural performances. This is another area in which the BTDB is ex-
pected to take the initiative in improving the organization of the
tourism sector (see para. 32).
21.       A parallel effort is needed with respect to the local produc-
tion of agricultural supplies for the hotels since part of the current
consumption of the hotels which could be supplied locally is being im-
ported (see para. 33 and Annex VIII).
'-.       The problem of inequities in the distribution of benefits among
the factors of production is perhaps most noticeable in the supply of
han.dicraft goods and cultural performance, with the artists and perfor-
mers receiving a disproportionately small share of the retail price of
theiI ouLput. In the case of individual artists--painters, sculpturers,
L/ The BTDB, for example, has already proposed to employ the services of
Mr. Raymond Naronha (anthropology consultant) whose report and recom-
mendations provided the basis for this Annex.



ANNEX XII
Page 7
wood carvers, etc.--the problem is often one of financing their raw
materials. By relying on shopkeepers and other retail outlets for raw
rmaterials financing, they commit themselves to supply finished goods
to these outlets at a price largely determined by the shopkeepers.
Even if the artist can afford to purchase his raw materials in advance
of the sale of output, he often cannot afford to wait unduly long for
that sale, and therefore must still rely on shopkeepers and other middle-
men tc market his products.
23.       In the case of orchestras and dance groups, the output results
from a cooperative effort--based on village music and dance associations.,
Here again the middlemen, representing hotels and tour operators, are
very much better organized than the performers, and tend to play one
viillage's association off against other villagest associations in or-
der to obtain the lowest "wholesale price". What is needed, obviously,
is a change in the market structure which will allow a more equitable
distribution of the proceeds from tourist expenditures on the "arts."
Another of the functions of the BTDB, therefore, will be to encourage
the cooperation of the local village associations so as to strengthen
their hand in negotiating contracts for cultural performances, and to
find ways of increasing the price of handicraft goods received by the
producers, possibly through the establishment of additional government
sponsored retail outlets (see para. 30). At the same time, the expan-
sion of market demand should in itself help to improve the bargaining
position of the artists and performers.
The Environmental Impact of Tourism in Bali
24.       Up to the present time, the extent of environmental harm re-
sulting from tourism per se has not been very great. The primary areas
of concern are related to the uncontrolled development of hotel accom-
modation--in terms of both location and design--and the lagging behind
of public investments in basic infrastructure--such as roads, water
and sewerage systems and electricity.
25.       With respect to hotel development, the Government has only re-
cently put into effect a limitation on the number of hotels of an inter-
national standard that can be constructed; regulations concerning loca-
tion, zoning, height restrictions and other development controls for the
island as a whole have been formulated in connection with the Bali
Tourism Master Plan.l/
26.       Existing hotel accommodation is concentrated in three primary
areas: Sanur, Kuta and Denpasar. Such concentration is a desirable
characteristic of tourism development when the goal is to achieve econo-
mnies of scale in the provision of basic infrastructure, but the existing
]hotels must provide much of their own basic utilities.  The current con-
'1/ Lack of such controls in the past has resulted in at least one major
hotel (The Bali Beach) of over ten stories.



ANNEX XII

centration of hotels is primarily the result of historical factors re-
:ating to the a'yailability of good beach sites not too distant from the
airport at Tuban.
27.       While the existing hotels have been able to survive on the
basis of their own electrical generators and water supply systems, the
lack of investment in transport infrastructure--mainly roads--is far
more noticeable.  Of immediate concern is the level of vehicle traffic
currently channeled through the main streets of Denpasar, contributing
a considerable amount of congest;ion, noise and air pollution to the
urban environment.1/
Maximizing the Net Benefits of Tourism Development
28.       In light of all of the comments above, it is obvious that a
number of steps will be requirecd in order to maximize the positive as-
pects, and minimize the negative aspects of future tourism development
in Bali. This fact was recognized very early in the preparation of
the Nusa Dua tourism project, and a considerable amount of time and
effort has been expended by the Government, IDA and a number of for-
eign and local consultants, toward the formulation of appropriate in-
ati-tutions, policies and control mechanisms for tourism development in
Ba]-4-
29.       The Nusa Dua project itself represents an important effort
in this respect, as an attempt to concentrate and control the further
development of hotel accommodation on Bali. This effort included the
preparation of a detailed development plan for the provision of infra-
structure and the optimal development of hotel accommodation. In ad-
dition, provision is made for improvements in transport infrastructure
outside of the Nusa Dua resort area, and for the improvement of infra-
structure in the nearby villages of Bualu and Benoa.
30.       A new institution has been created, the Bali Tourism Development
Corporation, which will direct the implementation of the Nusa Dua project
and manage its operations.  In the design of the Nusa Dua complex, pro-
vision has been made for a "lcommlon facilities" center which will include
space for handicraft display and sales, and for cultural performances.
The operation of these facilities will be directed toward an improvement
of the geographic distribution of tourism benefits--through a concerted
effort to bring in handicrafts and performing artists from more distant
centers--and toward an improvement of the share of retail sales going
to the artists ald performers.
31.       A similar effort will be made by the BTDC, through clauses in
the lease agreements, regarding both the supply of construction materials
and the labor employed during construction, with a major emphasis placed
I/ See Annex XI, paras. 25-31.



ANNEX XII

on the use of local products and the employment of Balinese labor--par-
ticularly from the poorer nearby villages of Bualu and Benoa. In ad-
dition, a hotel school program for training basic and middle level
workers is currently being formulated in order to ensure that Balinese
workers are suitably prepared for the job opportunities which the devel-
opment of tourism will generate (see Annex VII). The school is to be
operated by the BTDC, with contributions paid by the hotels.
32.       In terms of the overall development of tourism in Bali, a
major effort has been directed toward the formulation of a Bali Tourism
Master Plan and the establishment of the Bali Tourism Development
Board. As noted in various sections above, the primary purposes of
the BTDB will be:
a. Regulation and control of hotel development on Bali, in
line with the Master Plan, in order to ensure the pro-
tection of the environment.
b.  Monitoring and regulating the social and cultural im-
pact of tourism growth, with particular reference to
the numbers of tourists and the tour routes and sched-
ules, as well as the development of a "cultural aware-
ness" program for incoming visitors.
c. Improvement of the distribution of income and employment--
both geographically and between the workers, various mid-
dlemen, and the owners of tourist facilities--with special
attention to the problems of handicraft workers and the
participants in cultural performances.
33.       In addition to efforts within the tourism sector proper, tech-
nical assistance would be included in the project for the gearing up of
the agricultural sector in order that the tourism sector's role as a
growth point in the economy can be fully realized (see Annex VIII).
A Concluding Statement
34.       In summarizing the concerns expressed in this annex, and the
efforts made thus far--and those proposed--to overcome the problems of
tourism growth on Bali, it may be appropriate to borrow another quota-
tion from Luis Turner's discussion of international tourism:l/
Tourism, like many other industries, provides
foreign exchange which can be used to provide sig-
nificant numbers of local inhabitants with materi-
ally richer and securer lives. In the process, in-
evitably, tribal or national cultures will be modif-
ied, and it is right to show concern. No one eats
religious ceremonies, but one can buy medicine, food
and agricultural equipment with the money brought by
foreign spectators. In deploring their impact, we

can come close to argulng that cultures like Bali's
should be preserved forever, unchanged, in a kind of
social aspic....It is doubtful that the Balinese will
appreciate being "preserved"t to salve the consciences
of the world's sentimentalists. The key argument is
that Bali is now capable of entering the world economy
through tourism. The rich and "civilized" have no
moral right to deny them.. But we do have the duty to
ensure that the maximuxm amount of the industry's ma-
terial proceeds reach the Balinese themselves and that
the industry be regulated to make as little cultural
impact as possible, untiL the day when the Balinese
formulate their own policies.
