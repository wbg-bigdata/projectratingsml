MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
BANCO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMNTO ECONOMCO E SOCIAL
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBUC OF BRAZIL FOR THE
NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION CONTROL PROJECI
1.            I submit for your approval the foowing memorandum and recommendation oa
a proposed ILan to Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social (BNDES) of Brazil
for US$50 million equalent wt the guarantee of the Federative Republic of Brazil The
proposed Loan would be repayable in 15 yea=s on a fixed amortization schedule, including 5 years
of grace, at the Bank's standard varable interest rate and would help finance mdustnal pollution
control .nv, tments in Brazil
2.        .   Background Industrial pollution is perasive in Brazil, particularly in the
heavily indusalzed eastern and southeastern states. The industrial pollution is serious enough
in several Brazilian states to affect the health and well-being of significant portions of the
population. Unhealthy air quality, contaminated waters and/or exposure to hazardous waste are
quite common in these states. As in many other countries, the intense industralization process of
the last thirty years in Brazil did not take into consideration preserving the environment. It was
not until the late Seventies that some Brazilian states, commencing with Sao Paulo, began serious
and systematic efforts to clean up the environment and attempt to prevent its further
deterioration.
3.            Control of industrial pollution in Brazil is primarily the responsibility of
individual State Environmental Protection Agencies (SEPAs) whose abilities and resources to deal
effectively with these problems vary widely from state to state. In SIo Paulo and, to a large
extent, Rio de Janeiro, SEPAs have adequate staffing and resources to effectively evaluate levels
of air and water pollution, and identify the specific industrial sources responsible for emissions. In
Parana, Santa Catarina and Espuito Santo, the SEPAs are smaller and newer, but have developed
some good capabilities. Unfortunately, SEPAs in most other states do not have sufficient
resources to make pollution assessments. In some cases, reasonable efforts for water pollution
control have been undertaken, but effective characterization and control of air pollution lags
behind. Moreover, in all industrialized states, including Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, hazardous
waste problems have not been adequately characterized.
4.            In general, the federal legal framework is designed to provide overall guidance
and to set broad ambient quality objectives and minimum compliance standards for polluters. All
*        states use federal ambient quaUlty standards, with some states having their own legslation that sets
more strict standards. Legislation explicitly recognizes the power of states to set tighter pollution
control standards or to issue supplemental state legislation. Most of the supervisory and
enforcement functions including licensing, monitoring and fines against violators are left to the
states. Only a few states, however, have the necessary monitoring capability to ensure that these
standards are met.
5.            There are substantial variations among different states on the enironment
regulatory framework, but these are not a constraint for attaining ambient quality goals.
Enforcement of the law, however, varies widely from one state to another and depends on the
state's political commitment and resources. Sbo Paulo has enacted vy strict measures and does



2
have the insdtutional capability as well as the political support to enforce these measures. Minas
Gerais, on the other hand, has fairly lenient legslation and has only recently begun to allocate
necessary resources to ensure that industry follows the limited regulations in effect.
6.            Bank's Strategy and Actions for the Environment The Bank's development
assistance strategy to Brazil has three long-term objectives: (1) private sector development and
public sector reform; (2) increang productivity and improving the living conditions of the poor;
and (3) protecting the environment and public health. Ihe Banks medium-term objective in
deaing with    e nal issues is to ufilize its operational program to help Brazil develop a
rational policy frmework as weR as effective institutions and instruments for dealing with
environmental protection issues, resource management and the problem of protecting the
vulerable population. In order to meet this objectnie, the Bank is assisting the Government in
developing policies and programs for a) support of biodiversity and combatting Amazon
deforestation; b) pollution control; c) soil erosion; and d) natural resource management. The
National Envionmental Project was approved in 1990 to support the national environmental plan
and provide a framework for federal and state programs and protection of critical ecosystems.
The Bank's study of Amazonian environmental issues wil be the basis for policy dialogue and wil
contrbute to comprehensive regional policies. The Bank has several operations to support
sustainable Amazon regional development while protecting the rain forest. In the area of
poilution control, the Bank is using lending to strengthen institutions, to improve policies and
regulations, and to france industrial and urban pollution control. In natural resource
management, the Bank has projects on soil erosion and institutional frameworks for watershed
management and forestry. The Bank recently approved a natural resource management project
for Rondonia in the Amazon region to incorporate agro-ological zoning with policy and
institutional refiorms, and is discussing projects in other states in the Amazon. At the request of
the Group of Seven Countries (G-7), the Bank is administering a piot program to conserve
Brazil's tropical rain forests financed by donor contributions to a multflateral trust fund and by
bilateral associated cofinancing. The pilot program will support projects in several areas including
natural resources policies development, protected areas management, scientific research, and grass
roots intiatives.
7.             The Bank has assisted Brazil in developing institutions to improve
environmental management in the power and transport sectors The Bank has supported the
Government's efforts in developing programs for local, regional, and sectoral environmental
institutional development and plans; power conservation; environmental programs in roads and
irrigation; and water resource planning. Presently the Bank is developing a series of state-level
water pollution control and management projects.
&             Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement The Bank supported Sio Paulo's
efforts through two consecutive Loans for industrial pollution control in 1980 (Sio Paulo
Industrial Pollution Control Project - Loan 1822-BR), and in 1987 (Ihe Second Industral
Polution Control Project - Loan 2831-BR). Loan 1822-BR suffered implementation delays
because of its initial complicated design, which was simplified later and the project area expanded.
This proved to be a turning point and Loan funds were disbursed rapidly thereafter. Also, Loan
1822-BR was able to reduce industrial dust emissions significantly. Yet Sao Paulo's dust levels
remained unchanged because of the transport sector which was identified subsequently as the
main source of dust rather than industry. The overall success of Loan 1822-BR led to a second
operation; however, the latter Loan encountered serious implementation problems. Despite
strong demand for Loan resources, the Brazilian Federal Government (the Borrower) and
BNDES (its Fnancial Agent) blocked the flow of resouces to the State of SAo Paulo (the



3
Subborrower), because of overdue debt by the State to the Federal Govemment and BNDES.
This problem was finally resolved in January 1992. The proposed Loan would avoid these design
problems experienced in the first two Loans by having BNDES, as the Borrower, working with a
network of financial intermediaries, to channel the Loan resources to the ultmate beneficiaries in
various Brazilian states, without financial involvement of the state governments. Further, by
concentrating support under the proposed Project on areas where industrial emissioi!
predominates, the anomalies experienced in Loan 1822-BR could be avoided. Loan 2831-BR has
a component for diagnosing the industrial pollution problem in 12 Brazitian states. These
diagnostic studies formed the basis of the proposed Loan.
9.            Rationale for Bank nvolvement  Ihe proposed project for the reduction of
industrial pollution would contribute primarily to the third objectie of the Bank's strategy in
Brazil, namely; protecting the environment and public health. The Bank has been involved in
industrial pollution control in Brazil since the late 1970s, mainly in SPo Paulo. Ihe Bank helped
Sao Paulo establish an integrated appmach for dealing with pollution, combining long-term
resources for financing pollution control investments with the regulatory and institutional aspects
of the pollution abatement efforts. Thi approach has proved to be successful and several other
Brazilan states have requested similar Bank support to combat industral pollution.
10.           The          BNDES would be the Borrower and the main implementing
agency. BNDES, as the main source of long-term credit in Brazil, disburses roughly US$4.5
bilion a year. The Bank has made several loans to BNDES, the most recent being the 1990
Private Sector Fmance Loan (Loan 3268-BR). BNDES' assets represent 25% of the assets of the
federally owned banks in Brazil and 12% of total assets of the Brazilian banking system. In
addition, BNDES' equity represents 45%o of the total equity of the federally owned banks and
25% of total equity of the Brazilian banking system. BNDES began restructuring itself with its
most recent strategic plan to better serve the needs of private sector borrowers BNDES'
fundamental objective since the restructuring is to competitively integrate Brazil's markets with
those of the global economy. To accomplish this objective, BNDES in mid-1989 underwent a
sweeping reorganization which featured policy reforms. These reforms, which are being
supported by Loan 3268-BR, included a) a switch from public sector to prvate sector orentation;
b) implementation of an independent credit policy, c) rationalization of interest rates; d)
improvements in profitability and portfolio quality; and e) a reduction in directed credit. BNDES
is meeting its targets under the Loan on all the agreed reforms.
11.           Project Objectives The main project objective would be to improve the public
health and livng conditions of the population concentrated in and around industnalized areas,
particularly the urban poor. The Project would also familiarize the banking system with financing
freestanding pollution control investments and hence allow industry to have easier access to this
type of loan through a variety of intermediaries or directiy through BNDES. The Project would
also enhance BNDES' capability to understand pollution control problems, seek possible solutions,
and process loans of this nature. Fnally, the Project would assist in strengthening institutional
capacities of the most active SEPAs in monitoring and analyzing environmental problems, leading
to a greater level of enforcement.
12.            rjectD     ption The Project would consist of three components: a) a credit
line for industral pollution control investments; b) technical assistance for BNDES; and c)
institutional strengthening for the SEPAs.



4
13.           a) Pollution Control Inestment  Through the first component, the Project
would finance investments by Brazilian and foreign owned firms to control all types of existing
industtial polution. Al investment subprojects included in a State pollution control strategy
approved by the Bank would be automatically eligible for financing up to a free limit of US$5
million. Subprojects greater than US$5 million of Bank financing, or those which are not
included in a Bank-approved State strategy, would require prior Bank approval. In order to be
eligible to receive subproject financing in the state, each SEPA will have to s.n an agreement
with BNDES based on a Bank-approved State poflution control strategy or based on an approved
plan of action to prepare such a strategy.
14.           SEPAs' pollution control strategies are designed to effect overall improvements
in enviomental quality (air, water, and soil) in specific regions identified as havng critical
pollution problems. For each region a rank-ordered list of industrial polluters has been prepared
based upon criteria which include: (i) type of pollution; (ii) relative contnbution from the
industrial sector versus other sectors (mun*ipaL transport, agricultural); and (iii) assimilative
capacity of receiving mediums (eg. discharge into small stream versus the ocean). The strategic
approach will be to concentrate project resources in areas where industrial pollution is a major
contributor to overall environmental degradation. In this manner, more cost effective
environmental improvement can be obtained. This strategy improves on that of the fist Bank
Polution Control Project in Sao Paulo (Loan 1822-BR), which focused on industrial pollution
controL but without targeting areas where it was the principal pollution source in relative terms.
15.           The states whose industrial pollution control strategies have already been
approved by the Bank are Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Santa Catarina, Parana, Minas Gerais and
Espirito Santo. The priority polluting enterprises in each of these states have already been
identified, and are lsted in Annex m of the SAR. The Bank may approve, at any stage of
project implementation, any new state pollution control strategy which would allow the projects
included in that strategy automatic eligibility for financing under the Loan. Approval of a given
state strategy would be condidonal upon the institutional capability of the SEPA and its ability to
enforce pollution controL For states without an approved pollution control strategy, participation
is still possible if a) it can be demonstrated that proposed subprojects wIll eliminate or significantly
reduce an eonmental tbreat or health hazard, - these will be evaluated by the Bank on a
case-by-case basis, and b) the State has an approved plan of action to prepare such a strategy.
16.           b) BNDES Technical Assistance: BNDES would receive a small component of
the Loan (US$50,000) to develop its professional staff skills in environmental assessment,
ewironmental project analysis, and analytical frameworks for dealing with the economics of
pollution control regulations. The funds would be used for training of BNDES staff and for
hiring specalized consultants.
17.           c) SEPAs Institutional StrentheninIg: In order to motivate the SEPAs to
enforce pollution control more vigorously, and in support of strengthening their institutional
capabilty, BNDES will pass on to the SEPAs a grant equivalent to 0.2 percent of the value of
any BNDES subloan. A Loan component of US$150,000 has been allocated to cover this grant
In addition, a Japanese grant (US$500,000 equivalent) will supplement this fee (by providing to
the SEPA 0.8 percent of the value of any BNDES subloan). Thus, a total of 1 percentage point
(02 percent from BNDES and 0.8 percent from the Japanese Grant) would be paid to any SEPA
when a BNDES pollution control loan is granted to a fiin within that SEPA's state. SEPAs will
use these funds to: (a) develop pollution control strategies, including specialized studies on
market-based pollution control mechanisms; and (b) acquire laboratory and pollution-monitoring



equipment, and upgrade their staffs' technical capability. Additional grant funds are being sought.
18.           Japanese Exdm Bank is considering cofinancing in the amount of US$50 million,
to be disbursed on a pari passu basis with Bank funds. In this event, the Loan Agreement would
be modified to incorporate this cofinancing, and the Bank will be responsible for monitoring and
supervising the Project on behalf of the Japanese Exim Banl.
19.           The Project is estimated to require four years to be implemente4, at a total cost
of US$1005 million equivalent. Retroactive financing for US$ S million wil reimburse BNDES
for its financing of industrial pollution control investments from the date of the appraisal mission
of May 1991. A breakdown of costs and financing plan is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of the Bank group
operations in Brazil are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report
No. 10180-BR dated April 20, 1992 is being distnlbuted separately.
20.           Project Implementation The Borrower would be BNDES. The Federative
Republic of Brazil would be the Guarantor. BNDES would onlend the Loan resources through
eligible financial intermediaries (FIs), or directly to the enterprses. The Loan would be
committed on a first-come first-served basis; there would be no pre-allocation of Loan resources
to any particular state. This would help ensure that the Project would serve the most active states
in enforcement. Each subloan application would have to be endorsed technically by the SEPA.
The grant to be passed on to SEPAs would be an incentivt; to step up their enforcement program
in order to receive the maximum benefit of available financing as well as technical assistance
21.           The Loan resources would be onlent to the polluting firms at BNDES' standard
interest rates (currently between 9 and 12 percent above TRI' depending on each operation and
company). BNDES onlending terms are modified from time to time to reflect the economic
conditions in Brazil and the international markets. The firms must finance at least 25 percent of
the cost themselves in accordance with BNDES policy. BNDES would protect itself against the
foreign exchange risk following its normal "poolinge practices, acceptable to the Bank BNDES
may lend the resources either directly or through an FL However, because BNDES policy is to
not lend directly for smaller operations (US$1 million equivalent and less), and since the average
loan size is expectd to be less than US$1 million equivalent, the majority of the subloans are
expected to be channeled through Fls. BNDES has established eligibility criteria for banks which
could qualify as FIs for BNDES funds, based on solvency and project evaluation capabilities.
Over 150 bank have already qualified. FIs would have a spread of up to 3 percentage points
The subloan repayment period would be up to 8 years, including a 6-month grace period.
BNDES will inform Fls, no later than 75 days after Loan effectiveness, that thiese funds are
available and the conditions of their use.
22.           Proec-t Monitoring In order to estimate impact of the Project during
implementation, two sets of monitoring data will be required: (a) pollution discharge data
(gaseous emissions and liquid effluents) from the industrial facility; and (b) ambient data on
air/water quality in the environment under the influence of the industrial facilities' pollution
discharge  Pollution indicators will include, but would not be limited to, the following ar-S02,
noxious dust, odors (primarily volatile organics containing sulfur, nitrogen, and/or oxygen); water-
JV TR or TT dIs an Imtwa wage raw or intere pa on Cerdkaw of DepsL



6~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BODs (biological cygen demand 5-day test), suspended solids, toxic organies and heamy metals;
solids-hazardous wastes (primarily toxic organics and toxdc non-organics).
23.            CoLlection and reporting of pollution discharge data to the SEPAs will be the
responsibility of the ultimate borrower (the polluting industry). This data will provide SEPAs with
necessary enforcement information regarding compliance with state and federal pollutant
discharge regulations and standards. Overall, it will provide Bank supervision missions with
information regarding the success of subproject implementation as well as SEPAs' enforcement
practices. As a condition of subproject approval, the borrower must provide a SEPA with an
appropriate monitoring plam
24.            Collection of ambient air and water quality data will be the responsibility of the
SEPA. This data wil provide SEPAs and Bank supervision missions with information on how
effective the strategies are in improving overall air and water quality in critically polluted areas.
As necessary, it will also allow mid-course corrections of strategies to meet acceptable air or water
quality standards more effectively.
25.            SEPAs would demonstrate to Bank supervision missions that they either have an
ambient monitoring network available to collect appropriate air and water quality data in the
vicinty of the pollution control subproject, or that proceeds of the technical assistance to be
received will be utilized to provide that portion of the network. Bank supervision missions will
also review ambient environmental data and emissions data to ascertain that pollution control
standards meet pertinent state and/or federal standards, and to determine the degree to which
subprojects are consistent with overall project objectives and SEPA strategies. Supervision
missions will also review the effectiveness of technical assistance programs to both BNDES and
the SEPAs to ensure that they are in concert with project objectives.
26.            A mid-term review will be carried out no later than two years after the Effective
Date of the Loan, to review the progress of Project implementation, the performance of the
Borrower and each SEPA and state as regards their participation in the Project, and the
achievement of project objectives, including preparation and implementation of state strategies.
The Bank intends to car out such review any time before the specfied deadline when half of
the Loan resources have been committed.
27.           hPject Sustainabiity  It is expected that the Project benefits will be
sustainable given that: a) the imestment financing would be based on approved strategies, and
that the ability to prepare these strategies indicates a reasonable level of competence and
commitment on the part of the SEPAs; b) the Project will provide support for institutional
strengthening of the SEPAs, which should ensure that they will continue to monitor pollution
levels and enforce industy compliance with established norms; and (c) enterprises, once having
made the investments, and subject to SEPA supervision, will have an economic interest in
maintaining compliance at lowest possible costs.
28             Agreed Action  During the Loan negotiations, BNDES and the Bank agreed
that: (i) Loan resources wil be onlent to industry, directly or through PIs, for pollution control
investments at BNDES' standard interest rates; BNDES' onlending terms are modified from time
to time to refect the economic conditions in Brazil and the international markets. Agreement
was reached that the index used by BNDES will reflect and correct fully for inflation, and will
ensure ful adjustment on the principal of BNDES Loans; (ii) BNDES will inform Fls, no later
than senty-five days after Lon effectiveness, of the availability of the Lan funds and the



7
conditions of their use; (iii) Pollution control subprwjects not included in a Bank.sapproved blate
strategy or those requiring greater than US$5 million Bank financing would require prior Bank
approval; (iv) BNDES will pass on to SEPAs as a grant 0.2 percent of the value of any subloam
for pollution control financed by BNDES and originating from that particular SEPAUs state; (v)
any new state strategy fbr air or water pollution control, or for hazardous waste management, may
be appxved by the Bank during project implementation. Investments under US$5 milion
included in such a strategy would qualify for automatic Bank approval, provided they are
approved by BNDES; (vi) BNDES will have agreements with all participating SEPAs in which the
SEPA will undertake to (a) review and approve the technical feasibility and the adequacy of the
prposed ivestments for controlling pollution, each within its jurisdiction; (b) prepare semi-
annual progress reports for BNDES and the Bank on ambient quality and the impact of project
ivestments on the environment; (c) prepare progress reports on the institutional development
resulting from the use of technical assistance resources provided by BNDES; and d) develop a
strategy ff it does not yet have an approved one; (vii) the Bank will carry out a mid-term review
of the project's progress nG later than two years after the Loan Effectiveness Date; and (ix)
BNDES subloans will be on average equivalent to at least 60 percent of the subproject cost.
29.           Project Benefits Economic benefits of the Project cannot be meaningf(lly
quantified. Benefits in terms of improved air or water quality as a function of investment cost are
measurable at the subproject level. The Project's main benefit will be an imprvement m the
quality of the environment and, hence, the health conditions of the population living in the
vicinity of industrialized areas in Brazil, most of whom are the urban poor. The Project will help
to increase life expectancy and will reduce health care expenses and costs associated with lost
productivity due to poor health. Other benefits resulting from a less-polluted environment would
include improved agricultural products and higher land values, and overall better quality of life
because of cleaer air, cleaner soil and cleaner bodies of water
30.           The Project would also help to build up the SEPAs' capabilities and equip them
with long-term rational pollution control strategies that take into account not only the benefits,
but also the costs, of alternative courses of regulatory pollution control actions.
31.           Erpje2   Risks The risks of this Project are mimal Project implementation
could become sluggish if macroeconomic conditions deteriorate to the point where firms are
struggling to survie; enforcement efforts might then be reduced, and SEPAs' pressure on
industries may ease up. Slow commitment and disbursement could result from weak enforcement
efforts or small demand for Loan resources. If such a sGenano should materalize, industrial
pollution will remain at present levels or will be reduced only slightly. However, the more likely
scenario is that enforcement efforts will continue at different levels in the various participating
states, and that demand for pollution control resources will continue to be present. The risk of
slow Loan utilization is mitigated by the fact that the Loan amount is small compared to the
estimated demand for pollution control resources amounting to almost US$600 million. The
retactive financing to May 1991, provided for under the Loan Agreement, should further
minimze the rik of low utilization of Loan resources. It is expected that the Loan would be fully
committed within two years.

the proposed Loan.

BRAZIL
NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION CONTROL PROJECr
Procurement and Disbursement
Procunrement: The project will finance a wide range of equipment such as: advanced combustion
equipment, fabric filters, scrubbers, electrostatic precipitators, water pretreatment facilities and
primary and secondary water treatment facilities, incinerators, landfill preparation equipment,
equipment related to change of process, and recovery and recycling equipment. For procurement
of machinery and equipment costing less than US$3 milion, normal commercial practices would
be followed. International shopping procedures (including at least three bids, of which at least
two bids will be from foreign suppliers) would be required for contract values equal to or higher
than US$3 million but lower than US$5 million, and international competitive bidding (ICB)
would be required for contract values of US$5 million and above, in accordance with "Bank
guidelines for procurement" (May 1985). The project will also finance civil works related to the
installation of the pollution control equipment. For civil worls, normal commercial practices
would be followed for contracts below US$10 mfllion and ICB would be required for contract
values of US$10 millon and above. The Bank will conduct prior review of all ICB conttacts. In
addition, Bank supervision missions will conduct a post review, on a sample basis, of contracts
amounting to about 50% of the value of Bank financed contracts. There will be a 15% margin of
preference for the purpose of bid evaluation for Brazilian manufacturers competing under ICB
procuirement of goods. Consultants for BNDES' technical assistance would be hired according to
Bank guidelines for the use of consultants.
