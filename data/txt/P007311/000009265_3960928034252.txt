HMDORANDUK AND RECOKENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
oF THE INTENuATIONAL DEVELOPHENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVS DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
REPUBLIC OF HAITI
FOR A FIRST HEALTH PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Haiti for SDR 22.2 (US$28.2 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help finance a First Health
Project for Haiti. The project would be cofinanced on a parallel basis by
the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) for US$2.4 million
equivalent.
2.       Background.  Haiti is one of the poorest countries in Latin America,
and its economic and social development face major challenges. Social
indicators, among the worst in Latin America, reflect the poor health status
that prevails: life expectancy averages 54 years; the infant mortality rate
is 119 per 1,000; and maternal mortality is 367 per 100,000 births. Diseases
of underdevelopment--diarrhea, malaria, typhoid, poliomyelitis, tuberculosis
(TB) and other respiratory diseases--account for high mortality and
morbidity. Malnutrition, an underlying etiology of most diseases, is
widespreadt only one quarter of children under five years of age are in the
normal range of weight for age. Total fertility has risen and is now 6.8
children per woman. Modern contraceptive methods are only practiced by 4.9Z
of women in reproductive age. With the population growing at 2.12 per year,
projections show the current population of 6.2 million doubling by the year
2030. Since its silent start in the late 19709, Acquired Immunodeficiency
Syndrome (AIDS), frequently associated with TB, has reached epidemic
proportions. Overall, the current health problems in Haiti may lead to an
alarming increase in under-five, young adult, and maternal mortality.
3.       Responsibility for policy and public health services is carried by
the Ministry of Health and Population (MSPP).  The MSPP, which employs over
one-fifth of all public sector employees, has three layers of management:
central, regional, and district level. The central level is responsible for
service standards and norms, and absorbs a significant share (23?) of the
health budget; the four health regions act as the administrative liaison
between the district level and the center, orchestrating district planning
and budgeting; and the fifteen district offices oversee the functioning of
health institutions in 136 communal sections. A streamlining of the MSPP is
currently being planned, and would involve: the reorganization of the
central administration along functional lines; the division of the four
regions into nine departments to bring the MSPP in line with the
admlnistrative structure of other ministries; and the strengthening of
administration at the municipal level. Private health establishments, many
of them run by externally-funded non-governmental organizations (NG0s), make
up almost 502 of che health facilities in the country. NGO interventions in
the health sector have been, on average, more effective than government
sponsored activities but have been fragmented and often developed without due
consideration of gaps in services provided by the public sector.
4.       Despite substantial funding of the health sector--total expenditure
on health (public and private) reached 5? of GNP in 1987--the MSPP has been
quite ineffective in implementing the Government of Haiti's (GOH) health



- 2 -
policy, issued in 1982. Four key factors have undermined efforts to promote
public healths (a) excessive share of salaries C87.5X) In the operating
budget. due to lack of control of personnel recruitment and failure to
implement retirement policles; tb) lack of consistency in applicatlon of
service charges, poor management of revenue and, possibly, the disincentive
effect of charges to the very poor for preventive services; Cc)
centralization of human and financial resources in the Port-au-Prince areal
and (d) inadequate management capability and support systems (for procurement
of civil works, for example) in combination with crltical shortages of
miterials, equipment, and drugs.  The GOH has recognized these factors and is
seeking external financing and technical assistance to address them.
5.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  At present, IDA country assistance
strategy for Haiti has three main lines of actiont (a) support for the
economic reforms and recovery program initiated in 1986, mainly through
technical assistance and policy dialogues Cb) selected investments for
critical social services, education, water supply, and health, directed to
the lowest income households and in a framework of due attention to finance,
including sustainability, and to management and institutional development;
and tc) assistance to the GOB in securing external financing for the social
sectors by promoting coordination and consultation among donors. Since 1976,
IDA has financed four operations in the education sector to increase, among
other objectives, access to primary education; a proposed Fifth Education
Project is under preparation to expand the program as wall as to strengthen
sector management. IDA has also recently approved a credit for a Port-au-
Prince Water Supply Project (Credit 2052-HA) that will expand service
coverage while strengthening the operational efficiency, and an Industrial
Restructuring Project (Credit 2071-HA) that aims to complement existing trade
policy reform and generate employment. In order to address the most adverse
effects of the depressed economic situation, IDA is preparing a further
credit to support small-scale employment-generation projects and social
assistance. In extending the operations program to the health sector, the
proposed project would closely fit IDA country strategy, and would help
implement the recommendations of a 1987 IDA sector review. These advocate:
reallocation of public resources in favor of primary health care (PHC)
through increased financing of non-salary operating expenditures;
decentralization of management, including delegation of operational
responsibility to the municipal levelt and more integrated participation of
NGOs in PEC. IDA's presence in the sector would facilitate the coordination
of activities of other donors, by providing a framework for sector
investments. IDA would, for example, collaborate with the Pan American
Health Organization (PAHO) in implementing the AIDS and TB national programs.
Donor coordination would also be reinforced through the proposed parallel
cofinacing from CIDA. IDA financing to rationalize PHC services delivery in
the two departments of the Western health region (WHR) is expected to serve
as a model for possible replication by donors in other parts of the country.
6.       Proiect Objectives.  The project aims at assisting the GOH in
improving the country's health status and increasing the efficiency and
effectiveness of expenditures in health. The objectives includes (a)
reducing MSPP central administration expenditures by about 352 in real terms;
(b) changing the ratio of salaries to operating expenses from the current
87.5/12.5 to 70/30 by 1994; (c) implementing improved cost-recovery
mechanisms for medical services and drugs; (d) developing a more coherent
institutional framework involving the selective strengthening of key
management and technical functions, and the development and enforcement of
personnel norms and standards; (e) for the 2.1 million population of the WHR,



- 3 -
reducing both maternal and child mortality rates by 152 by the end of the
third year of the project, and by 402 by the end of the sixth year; and (f)
reducing the potentially devastating effects of the TB and AIDS epidemics.
7.       Project Description.  The project would includes An Institutional
develogment comonoent (122 of total costs) designed to facilitate and make
more effective the project's health service delivery activities, while
ensuring the future sustainability of PHC programs in Haiti. This would be
accomplished through: (a) development of simple budget allocation indicators
to monitor and facilitate a more effective use of public resources in health;
(b) design and implementation of more transparent and equitable cost recovery
mechanisms for medical services and drugs; (c) reinforcement of MSPP's
capacity to manage civil works, and development of better procedures for
purchasing and distributing drug supplies; and (d) redeployment of personnel
in the WHR to achieve a more balanced distribution between urban and rural
areas. To support these actions, the project would finance 20 man-months of
technical assistance. A health services delivery coemonent (63Z of total
costs) consisting of implementing a PHC services delivery model in the WHR.
The W'HR covers one quarter of the area of Haiti, and is composed of four
health districts, including Port-au-Prince. Under the project, health
services would be organized into 30 local health systems called Programmatic
Areas (PAs) that would assume responsibility for coordinating health sector
services at the municipal level. Standard health interventions, particularly
targeted to mothers and children, would be provided by community health
workers in regularly scheduled population gatherings. Further, NGOs would
execute specific project activities, and coordination with NGOs in the sector
would be improved. The project would also include the rehabilitation of 17
facilities and the remodelling of 11 facilities, medical equipment and
supplies, essential drugs, vehicles, materials and equipment for the
construction of latrines. and technical assistance. An epidemic prevention
and control component (25X of total costs) covering: (a) the support of the
PAHO-coordinated medium-term AIDS Control Program through financing of
laboratory testing equipment, education materials, and protective equipment
and supplies for health personnel. The AIDS Prevention and Control Unit of
the MSPP would be responsible for the implementation of this sub-component,
and it would be coordinated and monitored by the PAHO office in Port-au-
Prince; and (b) the development of an integrated national TB control program
through financing of drugs, laboratory equipment, and training and
supervision. The project would reinforce the institutional capacity of the
MSPP to implement TB programs through the integration of activities with
International Child Care (ICC), an NGO with operational and technical
expertise in TB control activities. The project would also finance the
organization of a conference on TB and AIDS.
8.       Project activities would be supported by a suitably staffed project
management unit (PMU), integrated into and drawing on staff of the relevant
MSPP directorates. Annual reviews, to be conducted jointly by the GOH and
IDA, would assess progress in project implementation. Donor coordination
would be attained through annual meetings to ensure coordination in
allocation of external resources in the sector.
9.       A Project Preparation Facility (PPF) of US$560,000 was approved by
IDA in October 1987, and increased to US$750,000 in April 1989 and to
U'$900,000 in November 1989. The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$33.7 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$22.4
million (66Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in



Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule D. The timetable of key events of project
processing is summarized in Schedule C. The status of Bank Group operations
in Haiti is shown is Schedule D. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 8008-HA, dated November 28, 1989 is also attached.
10.      Agreed Actions.  Agreements were reached at negotiations that.
(a) total expenditures attributable to MSPP's central administration will
decrease (in real terms) by 25? by September 1990 from their June 1989 level,
and by 15 by September 1992 from their September 1990 levell (b) the cost-
recovery study will be completed and discussed with IDA by April 1991, and
improved cost-recovery mechanisms, following recomendations of the study
agreed by IDA and the MSPP, will be put into effect by September 1991;
(c) the MSPP shall take all measures as necessary to achieve at the end of
fiscal years 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1994 and each year thereafter the
ratios between salaries and other operating expenses of 84.5115.5, 81/19,
77.5/22.5, 74/26, 70/30, and 70/30 respectively; (d) resources freed from
salaries will remain available to the MSPP for other operating expenses;
(e) data bases and financial information of the MSPP and the Ministry of
Economy and Finance (MEF) will be substantially consistent, so as to enable
better control over MSPP's salary expenses; (f) the MSPP shall cause each PA
to be staffed in accordance with staffing profiles that have been agreed with
IDA; (g) the MSPP shall maintain at all times within its staff an Executive
Director, a Project Controller, and an Engineer with qualifications and
experience satisfactory to IDA; and (h) the MSPP shall, no later than four
months prior to the beginning of each fiscal year during the projects
(1) submit to IDA for review and comments the public sector health budget and
for approval the detailed plan of pi-oject expenditures for the next following
year, and (2) conduct annual project progress reviews, including budgetary
allocation and management of health resources. Conditions of credit
effectiveness are thatt (a) the GOH presents evidence that key staff
positions in the PAs programmed to initiate activities during the first year
of the project have been filled; (b) the MSPP and ICC have entered into an
agreement stipulating, inter alia, the role and responsibilities of ICC in
the implementation of the TB control sub-component and the type of
expenditures of ICC to be financed under the project; and (c) the GOB opens
and maintains a project account under terms and conditions satisfactory to
IDA, and deposits the initial amount representing three months of operating
expenditures. Conditions of credit disbursement are that: (a) for the
rehabilitation of facilities of participating NGOs, the MSPP and the NGO have
entered an agreement, stipulating the role, responsibilities and reporting
requirements of the NGO, and type of expenditures to be financed under the
project; and (b) for the National AIDS Control Program sub-component, the
MSPP has entered into an agreement with PAHO stipulating PAHO's role in
carrying out this sub-component and the respective obligations of PAHO and
the MSPP.
11.      Benefits.  The project's main benefit would be to extend health
service coverage and improv^ the health status of up to 2.1 million people in
the WHR, particularly of mothers and children, and control the spread of two
major epidemics (AIDS and TB) nationwide. A second major benefit would be
the improvement of the effectiveness and efficiency of the health system:
first, by addressing financial and institutional issues; and second, by
rebuilding beneficiary trust in public services. A third benefit would be
the establishment of a framework that would facilitate future external
financing of PHC programs and integrate more effectively services provided by
the public and private health sectors.



- 5 -
12.      Risks. The project faces four main risks:  (a) the weak
organizational and implementation capacity of the MSPP compounded by the
political and social instability of the country; (b) the lack of financial
discipline and budgetary control in the sector; (c) the possibility of delays
in implementing the sector's decentralization strategy, particularly with
regard to personnel; and (d) the sector inexperience with IDA-financed and
policy-based health projects. These risks would be reduced by attention to
institutional development, technical assistance, improved donor coordination,
and the creation of a small and high-caliber PMU. The gradual phasing of
policy measures, supported by annual progress reviews, would also minimize
project risks. In addition, to ensure timely start of the project,
technical discussions on procurement and disbursement have been held with
relevant officials, and intense supervision efforts by IDA (four missions per
year) have been planned, particularly for the first two years of
implementation.
13.      Recomnendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
