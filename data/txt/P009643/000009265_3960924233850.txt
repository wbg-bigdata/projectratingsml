IMPACT EVALUATION REPORT
INDIA TARAI SEEDS PROJECT (LOAN 614-IN)
AND
INDONESIA SEEDS I PROJECT (CREDIT 246-IND)
PREFACE
Almost  two  decades  ago  the  Bank  became  involved  in  the  seed
industries  of  India  and  Indonesia.    Since  then  substantial  change  has
occurred in the varieties of basic grainq planted by farmers in both
countries.   India Tarai Seeds and Indonesia Seeds I were approved at a time
when the imports of foodgrains were causing serious drains on foreign
exchange.   Both projects had the general objective of increasing foodgrain
production by improving seed availability of new high yielding varieties. At
the time of project approval, the major potential of the new high yielding
seml -dwarf varieties of rice and wheat hadl already been proven by growing
imported seed.   Attention had begun to focus on ways to improve local seed
multiplication, seed processing facilities and quality control.
The Indian seed effort has heen supported by the 1969 Bank Loan of
US$13.0 million for Taral Seeds (of which USSll.5 million was disbursed), a
1976 Bank Loan of 'TS$25.0 million for National Seeds I and a 1.978 IDA Credit
of US$16.0 million for National Seeds TI.  Tn Tndonesia, Seeds T was approved
for an IDA Credit of USS7.5 million in '.971 anid was followed in 1981 by a
US$15.0 million Banl. Toan for Seeds 11.
This  impact  evaluation  report  covers  the  India Tarai. Seeds and
Indonesia Seeds I, initiated in 1969 and i971,  respectively.   Both projects
were completed in 197F and audited by (K)  in 1979.  These projects were the
first Bank-supported seed projecvs and are the first to he the subject of an
impact evaluation.   Because of the 16 vears of experience involved, these
projects are particularly sulted to an Impact evaluation.  During this entire
period,  the  seed  systems  of  both  countries  have  confronted  exceptional
opportunities  and a number of perplexing problems  through whlch  they have
continued to evolve and search for solutions hest fitted to national needs.
This report is hased on a review of the Proiect Performance Audit
Reports (No. 2551 dated June 18, 1979 and No. 2800 dated Dec-mber 28, 1979),
the  two  appraisal  reports  (TO-689a  datedi MaV  23,  1969    d PA-85a  dated
April 26, 1971) and other Bank documents.   A mission to huth countries was
undertaken in lanuarv-Fehriiarv 1986 by the Operations Fvaluation Department.
Mission  members  discuissed  the  impact  of  the  projects  with  the  respective
authorities in India and Tndonesia and h^ld numerous interviews with field

staff and seed pr,oducers as well as with Bank staff that had been associated
with these projects.
The valuable assistance provided to the mission in preparation of
this report by the Government of India and the Government of Indonesia and
all contacted staff and seed producers is gratefully acknowledged.
The draft version of this impact evaluation report was sent to
Indian and Indonesian officials for their comments.   Comments received have

IMPACT EVALUAT1ON REPORT
INDIA TARAI SEEDS PROJECT (LOAN 6i4-IN)
AND
INDONESIA SEEDS I PROJECT (CREDIT 246-IND)
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
India Tarai Seeds and Indonesia Seeds I, Initiated in 1969 and
1971, respectively, were the first Bank-supported seed projects and are the
first  to  he  the  subject  of  an  impact  evaluation.    Both  projects  were
completed in 1978 and audited by OED in 1979.  Following the 1969 Bank Loan
of US$13.0 million for Tarai Seeds, the Indian seed effort has been supported
hy a 1976 Bank Loan of US$25.0 million for National Seeds I and a 1978 IDA
Credit of US$16.0 million for National Seeds II. In Indonesia, the 1971 IDA
Credit of US$7.5 million for Seens I, was followed in 1981 by a US$15.0
million Bank Loan for Seeds II.
India Tarai Seeds and Indonesia Seeds I were approved at a time
when two important conditions converged.   On the one hand, the imports of
foodgrains had become a serious drain on foreign exchange in both countries.
On the other hand, two international research centers--CIMMYT working on
wheat and maize ln Mexico and IRRI on rice in the Philippines--had been
successful in developing new semi-dwarf, fertilizer-responsive, high yielding
varieties of wheat and rice, respectively.
Hence the main objective in both ptojects was Lo stimulate
foodgrain production by improving seed availability of the new high yielding
varietieo. At the time of project approval, the major potential of the new
high yielding semi-dwarf varieties had already been proven in both countries
by growing imported seed.   Consequently both projects focused on multipli-
cation of germ plasm that had already been tested locally, on improvement of
seed processing facilities, and on quality control.
Although different In various aspects, the design of Indonesia
Seeds I drew on the positive experience of the India Tarai Seeds Project
which  had  been  approved  about  two years  earlier.    The  incorporation  of
"lessons" from the Tarai experience was 'acilitated by participation of the
Chairman of the Tarai Development Corporation (TDC) as a consultant on the
Bank appraisal team for Indonesia Seeds I.  Common concepts in the two proj-
ects, though applied somewhat differently, were: (a) inclusion of a plant
breeding and variety testing component; (b) proximity of plant breeding
research seed production and seed processing; and (c) R compact area for seed
production.
Institutionally the two projecti were operated differently. In the
Tarai,  the Vice  Chancellor  of  the  Uttar  Pradesh  Agricultural  University
(UPAU) served concurrently as Chairman of TDC.  The TDC was in turn operated



- iv -
essentially as a private undertaking with a capital structure of:   farmers,
30%; UPAU, 30%; UP Agro-Industries Corporation, 20% and NSC, 20%. While the
foundation seed was produced on UPAU land, nmost of the certified seed was
produced  by  the  farmer  "shareholders".    In  contrast,  Indonesia  Seeds  I
involved three implementing entities:   the National Seeds Corporation (NSC),
the Central. Research Institute for Agriculture (CRIA) end the Seed Control
and Certification Service (SCCS).    Overall direction was to have been the
responsibility of a National Seeds Board, hut it did not play a key role
during implementation.
The main findings of the Tarai PPAR were that the project had been
generally successfuL and the recomputed economic rate of return (ERR) at the
time of completion was 18% compared to 17% estimated at appraisal.   At that
time seed production had increased from 420 tons of processed seed in 1966 to
an average of over 28,000 tons per annum from 1973 onward.   As a result of
the  project,  it was  estimated  that  incomes  of  1,150  participating  seeo
growers hal increased, as weLl as those of 2,500 seed dealers of the Tarai
Development Corporation and the estimated 400,000 smallholders using seed of
improved varieties.  The main finding of the PPAR for Indonesia Seeds I was
that it fell short of its pro.iuction goals, particularly during its early
years.  The principal project site at Sukamandi in West .Java, thougn suitable
for rice seed cultivation an.i research,  In the earlv years lacked adequlate
housing,  secoridarv  schools  or  a  hospital.,  so  therr  was  difficulty  in
obtaining resident staff.  Land devel.opment was delayed hecatuse of delays in
procurement of machinery And equipmenIt.   Mpchanized rice production had not
been well tested in Indonesia, ar.d the climatp and soils at Sukamandi were
such that mechanized dotible cropping proved difficult because of the short
dry season.   On the positive side, the PPAR has pointed out the effective
Seed (.Control and Certification Service established  throtugh the project as
well, as the contrihition of project-funded research in helping to prevent
serious production  losses iTl rice from Brown  Plant Hopper (BPH) infesta-
tions.  The PPAR, w-.-itten In 1979, considered Indonesia Seeds I onlv margin-
ally successful.   The recompuitecl ERR at completion was I]T versus the 58%
estimated at appraisal.
Tiring the seveni years since prolect completion, the seed systems
have continued to evolve  il hoth countries, assisted in part by two follow-on
projects in India and one in Indonesia.  In India the two follow-on projects
have modified the Taral approach, and extended the area by supporting a
National Seed Program (NSP) to develop a decentralized network of seed pro-
duction, processing,  storage and marketing agencies.   The Tarai project as
such has heen incorporated into the Uttar Pradesh State Seed Corporation
(SSC) and has received further support, including finances for construction
of two additional seed processing plants under the National Seeds II proj-
ect.  However, the Uttar Pradesh SSC, along with other SSCs that constructed
additional processing facilities under NSP I and NSP II, now has capacity
beyond cturrent demands.   In Indonesia, Seeds r focused primarily on rice and
on the island of Java, the main rice-producing area.  Seeds II has expanded
the focus to operate nationwide and to inc lude fouir main ariditional. crop.--
maize, soyheans, wriundniits nrid mIInTleaol



- v -
During this period, farmer participation in the seed industry in
both countries has been prima-ily in the form of contract production.   The
dominant firms in processing and marketing of certified seed have been con-
trolled by the provincial and federal governments.   The involvement of more
than one publically controlled firm in each country has provided an element
of competitior.   However, because of various inteiventions with resoect to
pricing atid subsidies, the devel pment of private seed firms has been con-
strained.
The Impact Study finds that, on balance, both prolects have been
Fuccessful in achieving their broad oblectives, although adequate data are
not availahle to confirm or reject the rate of return estimates of the
appraisals and Lhe PCRs.  The Study recommends that ir fututre seed projects,
specific field trials should be carried out to verify the benefits attributed
to the use of certified seed.
A number of important lessons have been learned or confirmed
through the prolects that should be kept in mind by Bank staff in considering
future seed projects in these and other countries.
Of particular relevance with respect to market demand:
(a)  Initial demand for certified seed depends primarily on a source of
new already-proven hiTh yielding germ plasm.   In these projects,
the plant breeding research of CIMMYT on wheat and IRRI on rice,
and their continued cooperation with national institutions, was a
key element Ln justifying the expansion of processing capacity for
the seed industry.   However,  the lack of outstanding new HYV in
recent years has constrained the deman.l for certified seed.
(b) Maintenance of demand for certified seed in the case of self-
pollinated crops such as wheat and rice, depends primarily on the
farmers' perceptions of the economic advantages of buying new
certified seed each year versus keeping their own seed. When there
are new varieties that have proven yield advantages, farmers tend
to buy new certified seed.   In the meantime, they save their own
seed each year until there is - 'ear evidence of decreasing yields.
Consequently,  appraisal  projections  of  seed  demand  are  easily
overestimated as has been found in India under National Seeds
Projects  I and  II.   Responding to this,  proposals  for a third
national seeds project in India include provisions for strength-
ening plant breeding research and for extension services to in.prove
farmer seed plot techniques in producing their own seed of estab-
lished varieties.
(c) Surges in seed demand may occur from time to time as the result of
a build-up of damaging insects or disease organisms such as
occurred in Indonesia with BPH and the virus diseases for which it



- vi -
is the vector.   Over time,  a series of varieties with improved
genetic resistance have been bred and released to seed producers,
and these have provided a series of demand surges for processed
seed.
(d)  For seeds such as hybrid maize, which loses hybrii vigor in subse-
quent generations, or soybeans, which require special handling to
maintain seed viability, many farmers will purchase certified seed
each year.
(e) Another ma'or factor that influences demand is consistency of
supply over time in terms of:   genetic and physical seed quality,
timely availability of seed at local outlets, and consistent pric-
ing at reasonable levels. However, in some instances, to encourage
use of certified seeds, governments have subsidized seed distrihu-
tion to the extent that farmers have simply found it cheaper to
purchase certified seed each year than to save their own. As
government policy, this type of subsidization should be discouraged
because of the market distorsions which are introduced.
With respect to national s2ed policy:
(f) The optimum roles of the private and public sectors may vary from
country to country depending in part on the stage of development of
the seed Industry.  Usually most funding for crop breeding research
will be from the public sector because the costs of such long-term
investments are difficult to recover by any single firm.   Quality
control and seed certification is also a key public role which must
be independent from other seed activities in order to provide
farmers with assurance of genetically pure seed of the variety
identified on the label.
(g) The private sector is frequently more adept than government in seed
multiplication, marketing and distri,ution, and should be encour-
aged.
(h) Government must, however, provide the basic legal and policy frame-
work to encourage progressive farmers, cooperatives and private
seed firms to make long-term investments in the seed industry.
Pricing policies must allow an adequate margin to the seed growers;
subsidlzation of the public sector is a potential threat to the
growth and usefulness of the private sector.
With respect to processing plants:
(i)  Design and sizing of future plants should take into account key
aspects of a country's overall seed system including best sites for
production of various seeds, best natural sites for seed storage,



- vii -
convenience to seed producing and distribution areas, transport
facilities,  etc.   When  the  first seed projects were initiated,
there was a lack of experience wit', marketing and demand analysis,
and with respect to appropriate size, location and design of pro-
cessing plants for conditions of developing countries in the
tropics.   Plants were frequentl)  over-designed and too sophisti-
cated. Lessons cat be learned from this experience and from some
small but very efficient private plants and should be taken into
account in future designs. Particular attention should be given to
this aspect in selection of the consulting engineer.
With respect to Bank Involvement:
(t) Bank involvement in the seed sector generally occurs because of an
identified urgent need for better availability of improved seeds.
However, at the time the need is identified there is usually little
institutional capability in place.   Rate of return estimates may
indicate a high potential return, but if a realistic assessment of
risk were made taking into account the lack of institutional capac-
ity, the results might be quite modest.  For example, in Indonesia
the objectives of the first seed project included establishment of
a National Seeds Corporation, creation of a Research Branch to
ensure an adequate flow of high yielding plant variet' s, enactment
of seed legislation and establishment of a governm t regulatory
organization  to administer  the  law.    Indonesia now has  a much
improved institutional capacity hut this is still not the case in
many countries  that need  improved  seed systems.    For  technical
back-up the Bank does not have a full-time seed expert nor a source
of regular consulting facilities with the full development exper-
tise needed. This merits priority attention.

I. BACKGROUND
1.01      This study is an effort to assess concurrently the imnact of the
first two seeds projects supported by Bank funding.   The impressive sutccess
both of India and Indonesia in reducing foodgrairi deficits in recent years,
through substRntial Increases in prodtuction per unit area, make!; thlese two
seed projects of specia'l interest for an impact evaluation.
A.   The Seeds Sector
1.02      Genetic DesiLg.   New improved varieties are the foundation of a
good seed program whether the varieties are the result of testing a large
number of varieties brought in from abroad or are the result of a good local
breeding program. In either case, the plant breeder sets priorities for the
characteristics  tco be improved and then isolates gene pools  (seeds) which
have the capability of transmitting to sabsequent generations such charac-
teristics as Ihigh yield, resistance to specific diseases and insects, better
protein or higher oil content, drought or flood tolerance, etc.  Ns soon as a
variety  is developed that  is superior to  those  current.ly  i u use, it  is
released  and  research  c-ontinues in or(der to further  improve  it, Perhaps
adding resistance Lo a new hiotype of an insect or race of rust.  Thus, the
development of varieties is a continuotus and ongoing  process  to meet  the
challenges of nature or special market demands. When the plant breeders have
successfully creaced a new variety of a given crop, there is then  lustifica-
tion for a seed enterprise to maintal.n and multiply it for as long as it
might be used and in such quantities as the market would demand-  Both India
and Indonesia now have breeding programs at various stages of development and
they collaborate with the international agricultuLral research centers.l!
1.03      Seed Multiplication.  The standard procedure followed internation-
ally is to have four generations of seed:   breeder, foundation, registered
and certified.  Breeder seed genetically represernts the end product or gene
pool which the plant breeder has evaluated extensively and found to be
superior in one or more characteristics.   It is multiplied In small quanti-
ties under the supervision of the plant breeder. Breeder seed is cthe first
major seed increase  of  the variety and is again subject  to very careftl

supervision.    If  the  production meets all minimum  standards  it will  be
certified  and  sealed  as  foundation  seed.    Its  progeny  can  either  be
registered or certified seed. If it is registered seed, then its progeny can
only  be  certified  seed.    Certified  seed  cannot  be  re-certified.    The
certified generation is the one used for commercial production.  To start the
cycle again the seed grower must either purchase foundation or registered
seed. Thus, the agency maintaining and multiplying foundation seed must have
good marketing intelligence data at hand to make wise decisions relative to
anticipated quantities of foundation seed which must be maintained and
multiplied to meet fluctuating market demands.   For hybrids there will be
l0OZ replacement each planting season.   For self-pollinated varieties there
is often high demand when first released and then a substantial drop in
demand in later years if the farmers only replace their seed every three or
four years. In other cases, where farmers plant back-to-back with different
varieties, they may buy all of their seed needs each season.
1.04      Foundation seed maintenance and multiplication of publicly released
varieties is a public responsibility. In Ind-.a, it was the responsibility of
its NSC, the State Seed Corporations and private seed companies which have
equal access to public sector-produced breeder seed. In Indonesia, both its
NSC and the provincial seed farms assumed this role.
1.05      International Transfer of Technology.  During the early 1960s, two
International Research Centers were established: one in Mexlco for wheat and
maize (CIMMYT) and one in the Philippines for rice (IRRI),  The success of
these first centers led to the creation of others for a total of 13 which are
the members of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research
(CGIAR).
11.06     Both CIMMYT and IRRI gave top priority to plant breeding focused on
higher sustainable yields.   Within a few years,  their scientists were suc-
cessful in developing semi-dwarf varieties that were resistant to lodging,
responsive to high rates of fertilizers and photosynthetically efficient,
enabling the plant  to produce  more  food  in  less  time.   These  varieties
generally had a type of foliage that took better advantage of the sunlight
than the  traditional  tall  types.   They also  required  a shorter  growing
period.   For example,  traditional rice varieties took anywhere from 150 to
260 days to mature, whereas HYVs would mature in 110 to 125 days with better
yields.
1.07      In-country  Modification  of  the Technology.    Scientists  in both
India and Indonesia have benefited from collaborative work with IRRI and
CIMMYT.   Both of these international centers sent germ plasm of their new
material for evaluation under a wide range of conditions.   When a certain
line performed well, the collaborating country could:   (a) release the line
directly, avoiding thereby many years of breeding work to develop a new
variety in-country, or (b) use this material for further selection to develop
varieties more suitable for specific environments.
B.   Bank Involvement
1.(8      A key component of the agricultural. strategy of most countries is a
rapid increase in the yield and production of basic gralns and other crops.



- 3 -
To support these efforts, over the past two decades the Bank has attempted in
various ways to assure availability of good quality seed of improved
varieties.   The efforts for improving genetic quality have included support
for plant breeding at several of the international centers associated with
the CGIAR as well as funding for several national research projects.   To
bolster the availability of quality seed at the farm level, over the past 16
years Bank lending has also been expanded to i;.clude projects specifically
focused on seed multiplication, quality control, processing and distribution,
and strengthening the institutions involved. During this period the Bank has
financed 13 seed projects in 9 countries and, in addition, has financed seed
components, typically with total costs less than one million dollars, in a
large  number  of  other  agricultural  projects.    While  there  is  general
agreement that the potential returns to these projects are very high, many
problems have heen encountered in implementation, so it is of particular
interest to examine whether some more generally applicable lessons can be
extracted from this experience.
II. PROJECT DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND PRELIMINARY RESULTS
2.01      Governmental support for these projects stemmed in both cases from
two main  facts:   (i) a substantial  balance of payments drain to pay for
foodgrain imports, and (1.) a new awareness of the potential of a strategy
for increasing agricultural production based largely on new high-yielding
germ plasm of wheat emanating from CIMMYT and rice from IRRI.   Further, it
had been noted that progressive farmers were taking up the new technology
eagerly but that a significant lag existed between the high yields already
achieved by a few farmers and the lower yields of others.
A.   The India Tarai Project
1.   Existing Seeds System in India
2.02      At the time of appraisal the Indian seed industry was little deve-
loped. The private sector produced small quantities of high-value flower and
vegetable seed.   The public sector attempted to disseminate improved seed
from small, government-run farms located in each Community Development Block,
with  little  success.   The difficulties  of managing  so diffuse  a scheme
resulted in poor quality seed an,' an imbalance in supply and demand.
2.03      The release of India's first maize hybrids in 1961 had been fol-
lowed by hybrids of sorghum and pearl millet, then by high-yielding semi-
dwarf rice varieties and finally by the high-yielding semi-dwarf wheats. All
were highly responsive to higher input use, gave greater profits, and created
a stro g demAnd for quality seed.
2.04      In response there was a rapid growth of private sector seed compa-
nies. In the public sector, the Government of India decided to create a cen-
tral  seed  organization  and  to  prcmote  legislation  to  establish  quality



- 4 -
contr^l.   In 1963 NSC was established and in 1966 a Seeds Act was passed.
NSC was charged to promote seed industry development, from production through
processing,  storage  and marketing,  and  to establish  a system of quality
control.
2.05      Through the mid-sixties seed output expanded rapidly--the certified
seed production area grew from 360 ha to 35,000 ha between 1963/64 and
1968/69, mainly in the private sector.  During this period NSC was concerned
mainly with foundation seed production and, after the passing of the Seeds
Act in 1966, with seed certification.
2.   Objec:tives and Project Design
2.06       By initiation of the Tarai Seeds Project in 1969, NSC occupied a
strong  position  in  Tnoiia's  growing  seed industry.   Hlowever, improvements
brought about bv NSC did not vet asstire seed production of highest quality.
Typically, seed production and distrihution were undertaken by scattered
inefficient farms which were rarely equipped with proper processing or
storage facilities.  Arrangements for breeder stock and foundation seed stock
were also weak.   The Taral. Seeds EProlect was  conceived  to address these
weaknesses   through   the  com'ined  efforts  of  NSC,  t.he  IJttar  Pradesh
Agricultural  University  (fiPA;)  at  Pantnagar  and  neighboring  progressive
farme rs.
2.07      As appraised, the project entailed the develoipment over five years
of qeed  farms on ahout 18,600 ha2' of land  in the Taral region of Uttar
Pradesh  ( UP)  in  northern  In(Ia.    At  fuill  development,  certified  seed

The Bank Loan (614-IN) of US$13.0 million was for 30 years, including 10
years' grace, at an interest rate of 6.5x.
3.   Implementation and Findings of the PPAR
2.08      The  Loan  Agreement  was  signed  on  June  18,  1969,  with  project
completion expected by December 31, 1974.  Subsequently, the project Closing
Date was extended twice, for two years (to December 1976) and then for one
year (to December 1977). Total withdrawals were US$11.5 million, leaving an
undisbursed loan balance of approximately US$1.5 million which was cancelled.
2.09      The project was considered generally succe-sful in achieving its
objectives.   At project completion,  annual certified  seed production was
averaging 28,000 cons.  To produce this quantity of seed, 6,883 ha of land
were leveled by the end of 1977 (versus 14,575 ha prolected at appraisal),
tubewells were constructed to serve 10,526 ha (as envis6ged at appraisal),
but the underground water distribution systems were not installed (a command
area of 16,600 ha was assumed at appraisal).   In additiu.i,  196 km of power
transmission lines were built (in line with appraisal estimates).   The farm
mechanization program as implemented was successful (though different from
appraisal projections) and fertilizer was provided only at much higher
prices.    Processing  capacity  was  provided  for  53,000  tons  of  seed  by
expanding three existing plants at lower cost instead of constructing two new
plants with a total capacity of 45,000 tons (as envisaged at appraisal). The
number of Tarai Development Corporation (TDC) distributors and dealers for
seed marketing exceeded 2,500 In 1977 (no specific target was given during
appraisal).
2.10      Several  major  problems  and  changes  of  original  plans  occurred
including:
(a)  the idea of constructing new seed processing plants was gradually
abandoned in favor of expanding capacities of existing seed
processing plants;
(b) the absence of suitable contractors for land leveling forced the
project to arrange for alternatives (UPAU and State Agro-Industries
Corporation) to carry out the work;
(c) legislation introducing ceilings on farm sizes contributed to lower
than projected investments in land leveling and no investment at
all in underground irrigation water distrinution systems;
(d)  crop  areas  deviated  from plans  as  follows:  (i)  for maize,  the
Bhabar area, where maize was to be grown, was much less developed
than anticipated due to the decision to drill fewer deep wells
there, while in the main project area maize suffered from disease,
(ii) for soybeans, due to a change in seed demand, and (ili) for
wheat and rice, areas were much larger than projected;



- 6 -
(e) actual mecharization differed from appraisal assumptions partly due
to a larger number of smaller farming units participating and
partiy due to other cheaper funds available for financing farm
machinery;
(f) high standards ot TDC management declined temporarily during the
second half of the project period;
(g) toward the end of the project, farmers shifted from seed production
to other crops (including sugar cane) due to a weakening of seed
prices making them less competitive with alternative crops; and
(h)  considering  the very  slow  prce of disbursements under TDC,  the
Government of India suggested that the Tarai loan halance (US$1.5
million) be cancelled and that future requirements be addressed in
the context of the follow-on project.
2.11      Despite the above-mentioned problems and changes from the appraisal
concept, the project's recomputed ERR was 18%, compared to 17% estimated at
appraisal. Incomes of the 1,150 participating seed growers had increased as
a result of the project, as well as those of the 2,500 TDC dealers and the
estimated 400,000 smallholders using the improved seed.   The project also
served, in part, as a model for two follow-on prolects covering most of
India.
2.12      Several factors contributed to the project's success.   First, the
timing of the project was appropriate as there was initially great farmer
demand for seed of the newly released HYV, and at that time TDC faced no real
competition in producing and marketing this seed. Second, the Tarai area has
a suitable climate and good soils conducive to producing quality seed.
Third, the project had highly motivated and well qualified management and a
good  organizational  structure.    Fourth,  seed  production  was  already  in
progress in the Tarai area prior to the project, pro"tding UPAU's Seed
Production Division, Progressive farmers and UP State marketing agencies with
some experience.   Fifth, the project received support from virtually every
group or agency affected by it.
B.   Indonesia Seeds I
1.   Objectives and Project Design
2.13      The project was to he the initial development phase of a modern
seed industry in Indonesia.   It would  locus primarily on rice but small
quantities of maize and soybean seed would also be produced.   The following
were the broad ohjactives:
- establishment of a National Seeds Coi'poration (NSC) as an autonomous
body responsible to Government through the Minister of Agriculture
for  seed  production,   processing,   packaging  and  marketing  of
commercial seed, assisted by managing agents and including:
(a)  development of 2,450 ha of Sukamandi Estate as a mechanized
and irrigated seed production farm to be operated by NSC; and



- 7 -
(b) establishment of NSC facilities in threc seed districts in
East and Central Java for collecting and processing seed
produced by farmers in selected villages under contract to
NSC, and the provision of credit facilities to such farmers;
-  creation of a 250 ha semi-autonomous Research Branch of the Central
Research Institute for Agriculture (CRIA) at Sukamandi to ensure a
flow of high-yielding plant varieties to support the seed production
program and initially to provide a seed certification service--to
carry out these functions, qualified and experienced staff would be
emploved;
-  enactment of appropriate seed legislation,  and establishment of a
small government regulatory organization to administer the law and to
provide a permanent seed certification service; and
-  development of facilities at Sukamandi by NSC and the CRIA Sukamandi
Branch  for  training  their  staff,  government  extension  staff  and
farme-s.
The Minister of Agriculture, advised by the National Seeds Board (NSB), was
to have overall responsibility for the project, and agencies of the Ministry
would be responsible for its implementation.
2.14      The project was designed to rehabilitate a large estate previously
under private operation into a tract of some 2,450 ha for seed production and
250 ha for a research station.   The seed to be processed and marketed from
the Sukamandi site (province of West Java) would be produced primarily on
land under the control of the Sukamandi branch of NSC. There would be three
other districts (Klaten, Batang and Kepanlen) which would serve as satellite
centers in the provinces of Central and Last Java where seed would be
produced under ccntracts with farmers.   A Seeds Act would he promulgated
which would embrace a Seed Certification Institution, Seed Policy (including
formal variety release) and Truth of Labelling.
2.15      A system of marketing and distribution of seed would he set up and
operated by NSC. The provincial seed farms would be phased out. Appropriate
consultants would be used both for the development of the seed production
program including processing plants, etc., and the scientific dimension of
the Sukamandi research center of CRIA.
2.16      Since the Sukamandi area is located within the Jatiluhur irrigation
district, which was being rehaoilitated under Credit 195-IND, it was planned
to use the district facilities and expertise to expedite land preparation for
irrigation of both the seed farm and the research station. In this way both
institutions  could become effective at an early date.   There would be a
resettlement  of  the  860 families  who were  ex-employees  of  the  original
private estate in August/September 1971 and May/June 1972.  There would be
seven scientific expatriate consultants located at the research center and
management consultants with NSC.   A marketing consultant was to assist in



- 8 -
setting up a Marketing and Distribution Program.   There would be a National
Seeds Board which would be concerned with planning, formulating policies for
development and operation of a national seeds industry.   It was anticipated
that a Seeds Law would be enacted at an early date.   The total project was
estimated to cost US$12.0 million equivalent.  The Bank would finance USS7.5
million or 62.5% of the total cost.
2.   Implementation and Findings of the PPAR
2.17      At  project  completion,  Indonesia  Seeds  I was  considered  only
moderately successful.   The ERR was reestimated at 11% compared with 58% at
appraisal3/ and this high only because it was favorably influenced by the
sharp rise in the relative world price of rice in the 1972-75 period.   The
PPAR concluded that the project fell short of its production goals primarily
because  of  poor  preparation,  design  and  management.    It  indicates  that
inappropriate production technology was specified for the seed farm at
Sukamandi and that staffing of the project with expatriate and Indonesian
scientists was slow because of the remote location of thie main project site.
On the positive side, the PPAR acknowledges that an effective Seed Concrol
and Certification Service was established through the project and contlnues
to be one of the most successful components. It also points out that through
the research and seed multiplication complex at Sukamandi it was possible to
prevent serious rice production losses that would have occurred as a result
of BPH infestations.  Finally, it was concluded that NSC management should be
considerably strengthened.
III. PRODUCTION IMPACT
A.   Seed Production - India
3.01      In India,  the Tarai Seeds Project in the State of Uttar Prade&'
(UP) had a substantial impact on seed production which increased from 42u
tons of processed seed in 1966 to an average of over 28,000 tons per annum at
full development since 1973. During this period the Indian seed industry was
studied in depth by a Government of India (GOI)-commissioned Seed Review Team
in 1969 and reviewed further by the National Commission on Agriculture in
1971.   Based on their findings, and the encouraging results of the Tarai
project, the GOI decided to reorganize and expand the seed industry. A work-
ing group was established in 1975 to prepare proposals for a National Seed
3/   The 58% estimate at appraisal was based on the normal assumption that
each year's net benefits would be reinvested for the remainder of
project life at the internal rate of return.   The overall return -was
also calculated on the assumption  that annual net benefits would be
reinvested,  not  at  58% but  at  20% and,  alternatively,  15%.   This
assumption reduced the estimated return to 41% and 37%, respectively.

Program (NSP).   The group proposed that the states accept greater respon-
sibility.   Hence, under India National Seed Projects I and II, State Seed
Corporations (SSCs) were to be established in nine States using the basic
parameters which had been successful  in the Tarai project.   In order to
retain the Tarai project and build a more ccmprehensive seed program for the
State of Uttar Pradesh, TDC was restructured to become a component of the
State Seed Corporation of Uttar Pradesh. The name of this Corporation became
the U.P. Seeds and Tarai Development Corporation, Ltd.
3.02      Table 3.1 shows the performance of the new SSC during the first
four years of the current decade.

3.04      The SSCs developed under NSP I and NSP II have provided a substan-
tial increase in seed processing capacity, to the extenc that for the moment
at  least most  of  the SSCs  are suffering from slow expansion of demand,
under-utilization of plant capacity and low profit margins, The Maharashtra
State Seeds CorporatLon (MSSC), established under NSP I in April 1976, is an
example of one of the wore successful SSCs.  MSSC has 16 well equipped pro-
cessing plants. Its gross income increased from USS3.5 million in 1979 to
US$22.5 million in 1985.   It handles a wide range of crops which include
hybrids and varieties of sorghum, millet and cotton, varieties of wheat, and
many oil seed crops.   MSSC is also a major producer of jute seed for the
States of Bihar and West Bengal which are major jute production states but
have climates not suitable for seed production. The corporation is currently
installing facilities to de-lint its cotton seed and thus reduce seed-carried
diseases and increase germination percentage.
B.   Grain Production - India
3.05       India's  advance  from  large-scale  importation  of  foodgrains  to
self-sufficiency has been the result of many factors in &ddition to the use
of improved seed.  These include the major initiatives taken by the Govern-
ment of India in the fields of irrigation, fertilizers, farm credit, agricul-
tural research and development and the like. There is no good measure of the
contribution of each; however, the existing evidence would suggest that the
availability of new high-yielding varieties and the broad distribution of
quality seeds made possible by the Tarai project and its successors, have
been key elements in India's success.   The extent of success is shown in
Table 3.3.  In 1985, India had an inventory of some 30 million tons of food-
grains in excess of its anticipated consumption. Per hectare yields of rice
increased 44% from 1960-61 to 1983-84 and yields of wheat increased 117% in
the same period.

C.   Seed Production - Indonesia
3.06      In Indonesia, over the ten years 1975-84, the total tonnage of rice
seed produced (Certified and Labelled) increased from 2,898 to 43,937 (Table
3.4).   It is estimated that the annual total seed requirements during this
decade were approximately  168,336 tons.   Approximately  one-third  of  this
amount, or 56,112 tons, was purchased by farmers and. the balance was from
their own production.   Within this frame of reference the total supply of
43,937 tons in 1984 was beginning to ap roach the anticipated market
requirements.    However,  NSC  advised  that  it was  having  difficulties  in
providing sufficient seed of the variety Cisadane, whose popularity with the
farmers had increased more rapidly than anticipated in some cases.   Better
marketing surveillance is clearly needed in order to be more responsive to

D.   Grain Production - Indonesia
3.08      During the 1975-84 decade, annual rice production rose from 16 to
25 million tons of milled rice.   BY L984/85  Indonesia had reached self-
sufficiency in rice production.   Tabre 3,6 ineicates that the total area in



- 12 -
rice grew only slightly during this period, while the area planted to HYVs in
the main rice-producing areas grew from 51X of the total in 1975 to 82% in
1983.   During this period, NSC multiplied and maintained 39 different rice
varieties.

3.09      Currently the most popular varieties are PB36 and Cisadane.   The
percentage of total hectarage planted to these two varieties is shown in
Table 3.6. Cisadane is a longer maturing variety than PB36. When PB36 first
became popular for its BPH resistance alid high yield, it presented a problem
in that it would ripen in January  dur;'r.g heavy  rains.   Th'  rainy season
usually extends until late April or early May, but frequently there is a
break in February. Thus, using the two varieties--planting Cisadane first so
it would ripen in February and then immediately planting PB36--had a major
advantage  in harvesting.   However,  genetically pure seed was necessary to
meet this demanding timetable.
E.   Cropping Intensity - Indonesia
3.10       In Indonesia,  two crops of rice during the rainy season became a
standard pattern during the decade of the 1970s with the introduction and
wide usage of the short season HYV. Frequently, this was followed in the
rotation by another crop such as maize, soybeans or mung beans, on residual
moisture.   Where irrigation was available,  a third crop of rice could be
grown in some cases.   Hence  the cropping  intensity cuuld  be dramatically
increased
3.11      The total area in rice grew only slightly, fluctuating between 8
and 9 million hectares per year, while total production increased from about
12 million tons (milled rice) in 1967 to 24 million tons in 1984 and over 25
million in 1985.  The average yield expressed in milled rice increased from
approximataly 1.7 tons to over 2.6 tons per hectare.  This trend is shown in
Figu-re 3.1.



-  13  -
3.12      During the period of 1979-84 the annual production growth for rice
was about 6X.   The rapid increase in production has been attrihited to
substantia] yield increases mainly in Java and Bali. In 1981 some 17 million
farmers participated in various intensification programs using HYVs and had
an average yield of 3.8 tons/ha per crop.   These changes in degree of
intensification were primarily in lowland areas.
3.13      New approaches were also possible in the 'ipland rainfed areas.  The
short season varieties of rice permitted flexibility in cropping patterns.
Table 3.7 shows how new cropping patterns produced douhle and more protein
per hectare than traditional cropping patterns.   These were rice-based and
got their impetus from the short season PB36 which is adapted to upland as
well as lowland condidions. Once improved and adapted varieties of the other
crops are developed, a much higher total production per hectare per year can
be expected.

land conditions to take advantage of aval.able moisture in keeping with the
moisture requirerients of a crop.   En lowland  areas,  where  irrigation was
available for nire months per year, two successive rice crops of a variety
like PB36 could he harvested within 26/ dIays, producing average yields of 6.8
tons per hectare in the first crop and 5.7 tons per hectare in the second.
There was normaLly sufficient time nnd water left to grow a soybean crop.
Previously only one long season ri.:e croi) was grown in the same time frame.
Another system, where only five months of irrigation was available, used a
direct-seeded short season rice varlety lust before the rainy seas)n start-
ed. It was followed by a short season transplanted variety. These two crops
were followed by a short season drouight-resistant legume like cowpeas. This
intensification was expedited by availability of seed of appropriate varie-
ties.

F.   Estimation of Economic impact
3.15        As arpraised,  the  prolected  rates  of retuirn  for the  two  projects
were quite diff2rent:   17T for the Tarai project and 5P7 for Inlonesia  Seeds
I.  At completion, the Taral estimate was revised slightly unward to 1IA4 an.d
Indonesia Seeds I revise,r shArply downward to  1l0.   The differences reflect:
(i)  different hases for the  tnitial estimates, as well as (ii) some indica-
tion of relative  suiccess during the disbursement period.   It is acknowledged
that these estimates are very imprecise.  However, if one accepts the assurmp-
tions of the  PCR, Then the e;timated net henefits generated  since completion
are  hroadly  consistent with  earlier projections and the ERRs reestimatecl at
aurdit can he retainerd as current best estimates.   However, it shoiild  he kept
in mind  that the  ERlR estimates  are' verv sensitive  to changes iln unierlivg
assumpttons.   Fu..r example, the  P'PAR for Indonesia  Seeds I indicates  that if
estimated  henefitq drue to avoided crop) losses were inc-lulded, this wouvld have
producedl an  ERR of  28Y.   This  type  of estimate  Is  hy  nattire  suhject  to  a
large margin of error because of the leverage of slight errors in vield esti-
mates applied to the  large  nutmber of hectareq  involved.   Improved est'mateg
wotildl require  careful farm level research focused  specifically ol1 meas-uring
the Incremrental vieldt of certifiedt seed over farmers seed.

3.l1      In the case of Tarai, benefits were estimated using a typical seed
farm as a model and taking into account only those benefits perceived as
arising directly from the investments, nqmely:
(a) increased value of seed over commercial grain production;
(b) increased seed production due to on-farm investments in land
leveling and irrigation; and
(c) reduced seed farm operating costs due to mechanization.
3.17      This  procedure  reflected  the  focus  of  the  Tarai  project  on
developing on-farm seed production and seed processing in a specific
geographic area--the Tarai area of Uttar Pradesh.
3.18      In contrast, Indonesia Seeds I was defined in broader terms as the
initial development phase of a modern seed industry for the country.   It
included the establishment of a National Seed Corporation, creation of a
research branch of CRIA, and enactment of appropriate seed legislation as
we'l as the major project investment in development of the seed production
farm and seed processing facilities at Sukamandi.   Thus, it was considered
that the main project benefits would be increased national rice production
and related foreign exchange savings brought about by higher paddy yields and
better milling outturn through the use of project-produced rice seed. It was
estimated that when the new seed stream reached full production (1977/78),
the incremental benefits would he some 320,000 tons of rice resulting in
foreign exchange savings of US$28 million per year; yield improvements would
be 10% in the first season of seeding, falling to 7-1/2% during the second
and 5% in the third.4/  Valuing the additional rice output at the US$87/ton
world price forecast by the Bank for the late 1970s, the project's economic
return would be 58%.
3.19      The reestimation of ERR at project completion for Indonesia Seeds I
followed  essentially  the  same  methodology  used  at  appraisal.    The  main
factors  accounting  for  the sharp reduction were:    (i)  a 90% overrun in
4/   Other benefits not taken into account in calculating the ERR were:  seed
of better quality and purity that should ensure a more homogeneous grain
which could lead to an increase in milling yields estimated to be as
high as 4%; disease and insect resistance leading to healthier crops;
and better utilization of farm inputs.   The appraisal estimate, while
including downstream benefits, was limited to the production benefits
directly attributable to increased yields from the new seed stream.

project  costs,  due  primarily  to  price  inflation;  and  (ii)  the  slow
development of NSC seed production and processing which had reached only 20X
of the appraisal estimatE by 1978.
3.20      During the following years, the NSC continued to increase its rice
seed production, but its share of the national total decreased (Tahle 3.8).

3.21      During this period, the Indonesian Government encouraged the expan-
sion  of  seed  production  on  provincial  seed  farms  and among private  seed
growers and cooperatives  In order to  speed up  the multiplicatlon  of BPH-
resistant  varieties.   This was facilitared by investments  in research and
seed certification that were part of the project accoujnting for 1.8% and
2.1% of total project costs,  respectively.   Research staff played a "key"
role in selecting and field testing HYV varietles for resistance to attack by
BPH (see also Chapter VT).  The seed certification service, through its field
inspection, lahoratory testing and seed labeling, estahlished qualit7 control
that made it possible  for the seed industry to expand capacity heyond the
limitations of the NSC olants so that today 65%/ of tne rice seed 1i  produced
by private seed growers, cooperatives and provincial seed farms (Table 3.8).
TV.  INSTITUTIONAL IMFACT
A.   Impact on Traditional Seed Svstems
4.01.      Neither India nor Indonesia had a significant seed industrv prior
to the 1960s.  With the advent of plant breeding research and the resuiting
HYVs there was a surga of interest in producing and merchandising seed.



- 18 -
4.02      In India,  the seed industry developed rapidly  in the 1960s and
farmers actively exchanged seed of new self-pollinated crop varieties.
However, within a few years, many varieties became badly contaminated through
admixtures and lost their genetic integrity as varieties.   In the face of
decreasing demand for this seed of variable quality, production exceeded
demand and many seed firms went bankrupt in the late sixties at the time the
Tarai project was being conceived.
4.03      There was a revival of interest in the Indian seed industry in the
early seventies as the Tarai project got underway.   During the interim,  a
seed law had been enacted and a seed certification program had begun to
provide assurance and documentation of varietal, purity.
4.04      In Indonesia, several varieties of rice had been developed hy the
Ministry of Agriculture in the 1950s.   In order to mtultiply and distribute
seed of these new varieties, Provincial agricultural officials used land
belonging to the Agricultural Schools whilh subsequently became known as
Provincial seed farms.   As demand increased beyond their capabilities they
would contract with individual growers.   Transportation infrastructure was
poor.  The seed farms made money when a new variety was released, hut had
great  diffictulties  in  the  interim.    Quality  varied  from  one  region  to
another, usually correlated with adequacv of the provincial budget and the
trairtng level of personnel.
4.05      When  Indonesia  Seeds   I  was  conceived  and  implemented,   the
provincial seed farms were to be phased out in favor of NSC.  However, when
the BPH epidemic threatened, NSC was not ahle to multiply and distribuite a
large enough volume of new BPH-resistant varieties to counteract the
threat.   Consequently,  the Government used alL of the seed multiplication
resources at its command, which included 350 provincial seed farms.   As a
result, in 1977/78 sufficient seed of PB 36 was increased to plant
approximately 900,000 hectares in 1978/79.   This led to the containment of
BPH to endemic proportions and was the beginning of Indonesia's move to self-
sufficiency in rice.   As a result of the successful  participation of the
provincial seed farms, the Seeds II project has now provided some assistance
to upgrade these seed farms.
4.06      Subsequently two other semi-government corporations have been given
seed increase and distribution responsibilities.   P.T. Pertani, an agricul-
tural supply corporation (ma4nly fertilizer), has established seed processing
centers in provinces where NSC is not based as yet.   Patra Tani, a sister
company of the State Oil Corporation (Pertamina), concentrates on seed pro-
duction of soybeans and coconut.   It does some contracting with farmers in
addition to growing seed on property which it has in the province of South
Sumatra.  In this evolution, the competition is such that the individual seed
grower generally has to contract with a firm or cooperative to facilitate
selling his seed. Nevertheless, the present system more adequarelv meets the
seed requirements of the cotuntrv than was prevIously the case.

B.   Institutional Effectiveness
1.   Seed Certification and_ Quality Concrol
4.07       In India, the in-depth study an.i discussion of a Seed Act before it
was finally enacted in 1966, was a major contributing factor to the success-
ful establishment of an effective  seed  certification  institution.   During
this period one of the best qualified international seed technologists worked
as a consultant with  Indian  officials.   This, plus the  training programs
which he conducted on seed technology, set the stage for an effective seed
certification institution.  Funding from Seeds I (India) facilitated setting
up seeri laboratories which are essential to seed quality  control.   In the
mid-seventies, seed certification became a State Government function.
4.08       in Indonesia, seed certification and quality control was formalized
by ministerial decree in 1971, as a National Government function.  Certifica-
tion of maize was begun in 1982; soybeans, peanuts and mungbeans followed in
1984.  However, the number of crops Is small in comparison to the Indian pro-
grams.   Lack  of trained personnel and  facilities  curtailed  faster growth.
Funding from Indonesia Seeds II helped to establish Seed Certification cen-
ters, including seed labs, at 13 key locations around the country and provid-
ed a new seed technology training facility at Bogor tlniversity, to strengthen
on-the-job training and rneet academic training needs.
4.09       In both India and Indonesia there has been a steady growth i.n the
volume of certified seed and In the number of crops included.  The Blue Label
used internationally to designate certified seed is recognized by farmers in
hoth countries as the hallmark  cf quaLitv seed.   Both countries  regularly
schedule in-service  training of seed certification officers (inspectors) and
seed lahoratory technicians.  However, this is recent and there were very few
trained seed technologists.  Thus, as seed certification grew rapidly it was
necessary to select personnel who had some training in related areas such as
crop production, agronomy and botany, and hlave them lea;n ab apprentices.  By
contrast, in  India  some  training  sessions  had  been  conducted  earlier  and
there was a cadre of trainecd seed technologists available when the Tarai
project was  Implemented.   Marathwada  Agricultural University  in  Parbhani,
Maharashtra State has a modest but very practical program in seed technology
research and teaching, whichi includes aspects of seed certification.
4.10       A large measure of the success of the Tarai project is attributed
to the enthusiastic and knowledgeable leadership provided by the then Vice
Chancellor of Pantnagar liniversity.   The implementing  agency  in  Indonesia,
NSC, was not successful initialiv due .largely to inexperienced management and
inadequate nreliminarv planning.
2.   Public Sector Seed Firms
4.11       Both  ountrles had a National Seed Corporation i-nvolved in process-
ing and Trarketi.ng.   In Indonesia, the NSC was also the prolect implementing
agency.  In India, the NSC waq on thae -dvisorv committee and held 20% of the
equitv share, inl the Taral T';Pveiopmtpent: (.r)rpooratIon  (TT().  hu t implementation



- 20 -
was carried out bv the TDC. Later this corporation served in part as a model
for the SSCs established under  Seeds  I and II.   Today the NSC has some
responsibilities for production and distribution on an interstate basis and
it serves as a national coordinating body.   In Indonesia the NSC does not
have provincial counterparts as such.
C.   Limitations to Institutional Effectiveness
1.   Seed Certification and Quality Control
4.12      Seed Certification can only maintain its integrity if it is staffed
with well trained personnel and is able to work within an independent
environment.    In  India  it was  able  to operate  within  these  parameters
initially, but in some States it now appears that it is being absorbed into
the  State's  political  bureaucracy.    This  reflects  a potential weakness.
Preferably it should underwrite its costs of operation by assessing adequate
fees for services rendered.  There is now in India a Central Seed Certifica-
tion Board which provides coordination with the responsible State certifica-
tion agencies throughout the country and will serve as clearlng house for
matters of mutuial interest.   National workshops on seed certification are
being held. These steps will help to prevent deterioration of its effective-
ness as an Institution.
4.13       In Indonesia, throughout Seeds I there was a lack of communication
among the institutions involved in plant research, seed multiplication and
seed certification.   These Institutions need to know what one another  is
doing.   This can he accomplished through seminars, conferences, field trips
and personal interaction. Gradually this weakness is heing corrected through
participation in the monthly Genetic Evaluation and Utilization (GEU) meet-
ings held by the Central Research Institute for Food Crops (CRIFC).
4.14      Lack of transport for the field officers has heen a major weakness
in Indonesia.   Bank and seed certification officials recognize this problem
and have stressed that it must be corrected.   However,  for budget reasons
Government has been reluctant to permit purchase of the vehicles.
4.15      The certification tag signifies that the seed in the bag meets all
minimum standards.   If it is mutilated or lost the seed loses Its identity.
In this aspect the Indonesian label is of good durahle quality while the
quality of cardboard of the Indian tag is not of best quality.
4.16      In certification agencies in both india and Indonesia there is a
tendency for field inspectors to rely too much on urniformity of height as a
cr,iteria of purity,  particularly in cereals such as rice and wheat.   The
prime purpose of seed certification is to documrnt that proper seed i- used
of the variety being multiplied, that the potential for contamination in the
field is minimal (through field his ary), and that harvesting, threshing and
processing  has  heen  carefully monitored.    Genetic  purity  is an absolute
requirement. Sometimes when seed stupplies are short, seed having a germina-
tionI helow the mirimum can be tised providing appropriate adlustment is made
In plant!:ng rates.   A variety having important genetic characteristics can



-  21  -
thus be retained and increased.   Some seed labs frequently place an inor-
dinate emphasis on the minimum germination percentage requirement for
certification.   It is a decision which should be made jointly by the plant
breeder and the head seed certification official.
4.17      There is an urgent need to expand and intensify seed technology
training to provide staff for the future.   The seed industry is developing
rapidly in both countries, and many of the early seed certification staff
will retire soon.
2.   Limitations of Public and Private Seed Firms
4.18      Governments  of both countries  have stated their interest in en-
couraging the private sector.  Table 3.8 shows that in Indonesia the private
sector is now producing as much seed as the NSC.  However, at times NSCs and
SSCs can be unfairly competitive If they are subsidized1 by Government and
produce  Large quantities  of c'ertified  seed.   As the ,1rivate seed sector
develops and shows a capabilitv of meeting the needs of ,he farmers throutgh
efficient seed processing and distribution, the role of the public sector in
the seed system should gradually be reduced.  The public sector institutions
will need to continue to handle maintenance of 'stock seed and the
miiltiplication of foundation and certified seed of those crops not being
handled  by  the  private  sector.    In  India,  the  private  sector  is still
producing, for the most part, Fl hybrids and low-volume high-value crops sluch
as vegetables while the State seed corporations and NSC produce most of the
seed of wheat, rice and other cropq wherte PI hybrids are not, involved.
4.19       In  Indonesia,  the  private  sector  is  effectivelv  involved  In
handling the high-voluime low-value rice crop.  Frequent evaluatiorn and a good
marketing  surveiLlance  system  by competent  seed  marketing  specialists  is
needed to gauge these potential changes of responsibility so that the farmer
wil] alwavs have the right varietv, at the right time and at the right place,
an1 to encourage the development of the private sector.
3.   Public Seed Farms versuls Contracted Production
4_20      The desigrn of Seeds I (Indonesia) provided for a large centralized
seed farm of several thousand hectares at Sukamandi.  Two major factors had
to be taken into account in its development and operitirn.   First, the land
needed development for irrigation and drainage. To handle this large area as
a unit, a mechanized farming approach was planned. However, contractors with
expertise on levelIng and drainage could not he fottnd.  It was difficult and
slow to obtain government authorization to import the large farm equipment.
Lacking experience and training, equipment operators were generallv poor and
maintenance costs were high.  As a result of these factors plus inexperienced
management,  the cost of nroduction was high and volume of production was
low.    In addition,  the  Government required  that thle  NSC employ  several
hundred employees  f the previ Ous onerator of thiq estate who wore not neces-

now used primarily for increasing foundation seed and producing initial
increases  of  new  promising  experimental  lines  not  yet  released,  while
prcluction of certified seed is now done primarily under contract. This has
permitted  increasing  the  volume  of  seed  produced  and  has  substantially
reduced production costs.
4.   Aspects of Processing Plant Design
4.21       Processing plants are one of the most expensive capital investments
of a seed enterprise.  There are three main features:  processing (removal of
off types, foreign material and sizing of the seed), drying to below 11%
moisture, and storage.  Wheat Is ustually quite  low in moisture content when
harvested under normal. conditions. Hence the needed drying is minimal.
4.22       Prior  to  these  two  projects,  very  little  experience  had  been
accumulated on designing seed processing plants in the tropics.  As a result,
much had to be learned relative to appropriate size and design.  Hence the
plants were probably no more than 40% effective.
4.23       The  renovated  plant used  by  the  Tarai  prolect had  capacity  to
handle up to 10,000 tons per year.  The Bank was flexible in permitting the
renovation of an old plant rather than constructing a new one as originally
scheduled.    Thus,  the  effectiveness  of  this  design  was  reasonably  good
although there were some shortctomings which will, he disetssed later.
4.24       The  Sukamandi plant, on the other hand, was over-huilt and1 ,nore
sophisticated than necessarv.  Klaten I, also built on Seeds I funds, was an
improvement in that it was less complex than SuWamandi.  Klaten II benefited
from  the  experiences  gained  with  Sukamandi and  Klaten  I.   It has a dust
collector which the earlier plants did not have.  Thus, work areas are easy
to maintain.  The qualitv of the concrete appears to be good.  These feattures
are essential for minimizing contamination  due to spillage anrd for ease of
cleanup   between   lots.       The  artificial  drving   facility,  however,  is
Inefficient.   Thus, the overall effectlveness of the  Indonesian  processing
plants was low, in spite of the better recent construction.
4.25       The bulk storage at the Tarai and Sukamandi was not efficient for
handling varying nuantities of manv varieties.   As farmers deliver the  raw
product (seed) to the processing plant in sacks where it is processed and
thien  bagged  again, storage  warehouses  such  as  those  built  for  Klaten  IT
proved more functional.
4.26       Checking the moisture content of the seed is an important quality
cilteria.  Too frequiently moisture meters were located in a dark environment
where  it  is d1ifficult to make accurate  and quick  readings.   A relatively
large digital readout instrument is needed.   Also, not enough  thought was
given to conditions for efficient cleaning of equipment and work areas
between lots to prevent or at least minimize contamination  of one  lot with
seeds from another.



-  23  -
4.27       The configuration for installation of equipment in the provincial
seed farm facilities in Indonesia was poor.   It created an environment for
inefficient use of manpower and potential contamination.   Too often, in the
interest of saving funds, there was a tendency to buy locally made equip-
ment.   For processing seed only the best equipment is the best investment.
The turnkey contract approach continues to be the best until more experience
is gained  and expertise  is  readily available.   High quality concrete  is
essential.   Cracks and crumbling directly contrihute to unsatisfactory work
areas  and a major contamination factor.   In contrast,  a private  firm in
Jalna, Maharashtra State in India had excellent concrete work.
4.28       Artificial drying is a key facility in the tropics.  At some sites
sunshine is adequate, but most will require better drying provisions for the
rainy seasons.  At Klaten I and II in Central Java, Indonesia, an otherwise
good facility hnad a sack drier which was inefficient because of the resist-
ance due to the sack.   Holes were poked in the sack to reduce this resist-
ance.   This automatically contributed to contamination.   Some type of bulk
batch drier would be much more satisfactory. This feature definitely limited
the effectiveness of this plant.
4.29       There  is  a  tendency  to  design  the  seed  processing  plants  too
ldrge.   It would be better to keep them to about a 5,(OO-ton capacity per
year for cerea]s such as wheat and rice.   Plans should also have taken into
account the potential need to process seeds of other crops in the futuire.  A
private orocessor near Solo in Central Java, Indonesia was cdoing an excellent
lob with a plant having about a 3,000-ton capacitv per year and a relatively
small warehouse.   He moved his seed quickly, thus avoiding a large inventory
an(d the need for a large storage warehouse.
V. IMPACT ON PRTVATF SFFD INDUSTRY
A.   Release of New Varieties
5.0:      In most developing countries ,here are three potential sources for
rnew varieties:   national research agencies,  universities and international
agricultural research centers.  One of the features of hoth the Tarai (India)
and Seeds I (Indonesia) prolects was a National. Seed Board (NSB) which wotuld
have among its responsibilities the release of new varieties and Fl hybrids
developed hy public institutions.
5.e2       IRRI and CIMMYI have  international  networks  for evaluating germ
plasm  throughotut  the world.       Any  country  can  participate.    If  a  line
performs well in a certain country, that country can either release it as a
variety or use it as parental material for further plant breeding research.
5.03      FjIndation  seed  of ptublicly developed  varieties  is uciallly also
a'ailahle to the private seed firms for their increase anId marketing.



-  24  -
B.   Range of Crops being Handled bv the Private Sector
5.04       The majority of the private seed firms in these two countrles are
quite modest.  They include growers who produce, process and market their own
production; associations of sead growers, village cooperatives -ho frequently
produce seeds primarily for their own members; processors who contract for
production and then market it; and seed dealers who buy and sell.
5.05       In some states of India there are also progressive seed firms which
have their own plant breeding programs bult contract with neighboring farmers
for the production of  their Fl hyhrids or varieties.   They then do their
marketing throtigh a network. of sales locations.   There are also a few inter-
national plant breeding firms with limited operations in Intdia. These firms
typically develop their own germ plasm of one or many crops, evaluate It
internati.onally and market it in many countries unider franchise arrangements
with  local  dealers,  providing  government  permits  can he obtained.   These
firms deal almost exclusivelv withi Fl hybrids and vegetables (low volume,
high value).
5.06       The private sector is producing about half the seed distribhuted in
Indonesia (Table 3.,), but none of these firms have their owni breeding pro-
grams.   There are three private international firms, one hased In Thailand
and  two in the  Phi  ppines.  whi ch have  franchises  for  the  product ion of
hybrid maitze in TnIdonesia and are prodticing thetr first crops in 1986.
C.   Effe-ts of Government Subsidies
5.0O7      Thle private  sector Tmrust make a o.rrotit eiLvier foir the  individual
owning  the firm or its shareholders.   If possl Pe., theset  fir,,s prefer  to
market an item  (variety  or hybrid) w-4e:h thelr competition does nwO  h,ive.
Hence if there Is the potentia. and thev have the workiniz capital to retain
an appropriqte  ;ci entif1c staff they w1.l1 concentraite on Ft hvbri1ds.   t t.her
wise, If they are merchandising publiclv developed varieties, they must have
a good marketing program  nd(1 handle large vollimes at a sma I1 mark-up in order
to compete profitabLy.  They are freiuertly ntut in a difficult position1 i,-
thev have  to  compete with national  or stite  s:eed(  corporations, which are
usuallv given a vovernment qsu"sidy that enabiles then to undersel l the private
sector.
5.(8       One example of private firms placed at a disadvantage was in West
Java (Indonesia) where some Individual seed growers, who had a modest income
from  a seed enterprise previously,  are now having difficul[ty in mnarketing
their production at a profitable level becatise of the low pricces at which the
NSC sells the same variety.
D.   Financing
5.09       Both wovernments (Tndonpsla ani  Inria) have stated their fnrtnt to
encourrage t he ; r'vate se t.or.   However. to-ie small  a:id med liur-sizzen urivate

primarily  into  three  forms:    production  credit,  investment  credit  and
operating  credit  (for  purchase  and  sale).    Any  seed  activity  involving
research or seed processing and storage will need some investment credit as
well  as  production  credit.    From  the  time  a  plant  breeding  program  is
initiated  until  it may  have  a  "payoff" will  take  from  10 to  15 years.
Thereafter there should be something coming off the "heltline" every two or
three years.   Hence assistance of  long-term low-interest  loans  is needed
during  this  development  period.    Those  firms  which  are  processing  and
marketing need operating credit to purchase from the seed growers upon
delivery and meet expenses until they get paid for the certified seed they
sell.
5.1(      A case in point was a small, private, efficiently operated firm In
Central Java, In.donesia which usually received only half the valuie as a down
payment for seed sold until those who purchased it cotild pay in full after
about a month's time.  To ohtain operating credit from the local hartk, this
entrepreneur had to mortgage his home.  The local hank woltld not consider his
inventory of seed or accounts receivable as collater,l.
5.11      DurIng the rainy season the rice farmers plant "hnack to back; that
is, they harvest a crop and immediately prepare the soil and plant a second1
crop to take maximium advantage of the short maturing HYVs.  T'o handle two
crops in orie rafny season the seed dealer must purchase, (claT  and sell a
largre quantlty of seed in a short period if he wishes to retaini his share olf
the market.  Thas, operating credit is critical.  Xome Drolnistng new ffrmo in

6.04      Although  losses  can  be  controlled  in  part  through  appropriate
cultural practices and sanitation methods or with chemicals, the preferred
approach, used in India, is to find or develop varieties with resistance to
the prevalent races of rust.  In India, new races evolve in the foothills of
the Himalayas or in high elevations in the south.   The spores are carried
over great distances (North and South) by wind currents.  All new germ plasm
developed by wheat breeders is systematically screened by the plant
pathologists at a rust research center at Simla in Himachel Pradesh State.
To keep  current  on  the disease  situation,  plant  pathologists  operate  an
All-India Wheat Disease Surveillance Program.
6.05      When the original germ plasm was received from CIMMYT (mid-1960s),
some of it was still  segregating  for characters such as rust resistance,
maturity and grain type.  Indian scientists selected strains more suitahle to
Indian conditions from this segregating material. This research resulted in
the development of the varieties Sonalika and Kalyan Sona.  They became very
popular with the farmers because of their high yields, rust resistance, amber
or white grains (in contrast to the red grains of the original seed imported
from  Mexico)  and  adaptahility  to  a wide  spectrum  of soil  and  climat1c
conditions throughotut the cotintry.   The Tarai project plavfd a key role in
their initial, seed increase and continued maintenance.   The variety Sonalika
is still widely used.  Even thotugh new races of rust have evolved, ft still
gives good performance since it Is very early matturing and It es(apes the
most serious rust attacks.   Thus, by use of resistant  varieties  aTnd good
cultural practices, wheat production has steadily Increased without the need
for heavy fungicide applications whlich could have deleterious effects on the
environment.
B.   Brown Plant Hopper (BPE1) in Indonesia
6.06       This insect had been noted miore than a century ago in Java.  It was
endemic on rice until the earlv 1970s.  With the advent of HYVs, it suddenlv
became epidemic.  It is a sucking insect whi(h can reduce the rice plant to a
wilted or hurned state wi hin a few hours whern present in large numbers.  It
is also the vector or carrier of two serious virus diseases of r.ce--ragged
sttunt and grassy stunt.
6.07      In the past, the only effective control for BPH had been use of ant
insecticide.    Furadan  was  the  most  effective.    IRRI  was  successful  in
isolating genetic resistance. The first varietv carrying stuch resistance was
IR20  and  it  was  followedi by  IR26 which,  after  local  testing,  Indonesia
released in 1975 (as PB26) in an endeavor to control the spread of BPH.  'V
1977, the P826 resistance was hredkLng down.  It was then realized that there
was  another  biotype  of  BPH.         Throrugh  the  collaboration  of  TRRI's
Tnternational  Rice Testing lProgram with  Indonesia's CRIFC, an experimental
line  from  IRRI,  identified  as  1R2071 ,5/ proved  to  he  resistant  to  both

hiotypes 1 and 2. The rapid increase of this seed as Indonesian variety PB36
is descrihed in Chapter 4.
6.08      The  Sukamandi  eiitomology  research  (fu1nded  by  Seeds  I)  made  a
significant contribution to understanding better the spread of BPH throughout
Indonesia.  Research coordinated by CRIFC at Bogor dleveloped a method to map
emerging biotypes employing reports twice a year from 1,000 locations
throughout the country.  The identification Is based on a set of rice variety
differentials  which  enables  the  scientists  to  determine  the  prevailing
biotypes. This "early warning" system, designed and calibrated by Indonesiar
scientists,  enabled  NSC  to  organize  its  seed  production  program  more
effectively.
6.ns       From 1978 to 1982, the gene fcr resistance to hiotype 2 kept the
brown plant hopper population under control, buit then there was evidence of a
possihle  new hiotype  emerging  in  the  province  of  North  Sumatra.   As an
interim emergency  control measure,  extensive  spraying was  done.    In the
meantime,  oxperimental  reqults indicated  that the  TRRI variety,  1R56,  was
resistant to this apparenit new biotvpe.   In qtuick response, 21 tons of seed
was airlifted from the Philippines by the Indonesian Air Force in February
1983.   Most of it was planted  in North  Sumatra in earlv March and  the
remainder in other provinces of Sumatra as well1 as on Java and Ball.  As a
result,  this  hi otype  dId  not  cauise  serious  damage  to   ncloneIi an  rice
prodtt ti on.
6.10      The North Sumatra emergencv is an example of the speed with which a
new varietv cal bhe made avai lable to the tarmers whenl varieties or germ plasm
have been deve I opedi in anti ci pat ion of fusture cha 1 lenges .and when pi1ot seed

resistance, hiologicaI and rIl turai eontrols, and when necessarv the use of
inseCt Icides in an economi cal v and ecoIoI ca1 Iv suItable means of control.
The ava lahi 1.itv of genet ical Iv puire seed of resistant varieties is a key
as pePt.
ViT.  PROJECT SUSTATNABILITY AND REPLICABIlTTY
7.01      India rarai Seeds and Indonesia Seeds I were both conceived to help
farmers realize the notential high returns from adoption of new high-yielding
varieties.   The objective  of hoth projects was to set tup mechanisms  for
multiplying and .istributing seeds of these HYVs  in such a way that the
genetic characters for high yiel(d would he carrJed through to the ultimate
users by carefullv supervised production and distribution of the new varie-
ties.   At appraisal, there was good evidence of the need for suich improve-
ments in the seeds system.  The issuec that arise now do not dispute the need
nor the positive impact of these projects.   Rather, they relate to sustaina-
hilitv and rerlicahilitv of the projects--to the effectiveness and efficiency
of the specific strategv emploved, to the tvpos of institultions created, and
to aspects of project design and imPlementation.

A.    Sustainability
7.02       In spite of various impLementation problems confronted during the
disbursement period and in the peridc! since prolect completion, both of these
project" appear to have good underly.ing bases for sustainaMlitv.  Th_. impor-
tance  of  a good  national  seeds  sysat*ein is now  generallv accepted  in  both
countries and is seen not as a one-time change of varieties hut as a process
that mist continue.   Within this context.  the learning process is still con-
tinuing and both countries are Fteekin the optimum mix of public andl private
involvement in the various coitponenti; oE the seeds system.   Both countries
have developed follow-on project:s that take into account lessons learned from
these first projects.
7.03       Thus, the focus here is on ciPe sistainabiltity of the various com-
ponents of the two national seeoc systems as noW constituted.
1.   Sustainability of Seeci Ce;-rificatUon
7.04       Seed certification is the only system yet devised to docurnernt the
genetic purity of a variety.   It Is not possible to distinunjlsh i one variDty
from all other varieties of that crop only on the basts of visual (haracter-
istics  of the  see(i or plant.   TlVa estahlishment  of a speed  certificati on
Institution was a key funCtioTn in the design of hoth of tlhoes.e proje(ts.  Inl

2.   Sustainabil .tv of P"ublic Secl..r Productiorn and Marketing
7.06       The overall strategy employed in these two projects was to expand
the roLe of publi.c sector institutions  in the seed  industry  to handle not
only plant breeding, product:'on of foundation seed and quality control, but
also  large-scale  production, processing, certification  and  distribution  of
seeds.  The importance to the nation of a good seed system seemed at the time
to justify major public in%ef-;tments in the seed industry.
7.07       This was the justification for the Tarai proiect, namely thAt: prior
to the nro-ect, seed Droduction and d1strihution was undertaken by scatt:e(re
i-nefficient  farms  whIch  were  rarely  eaulrped  with  proper  proceqs.rt,c  or



-  29  -
storage facilities.   The project also sought to expand seed production on a
fairly conicentrated area of some 18,623 ha through land leveling, irrigating
and mechanizing seed farms and through processing and marketing of the seed
produced.
7.08      The Indonesian approach was similar in that the major investments
were  in  pthysical. improvements  for  a  seed  farm  and  in  establishment  of
processing and marketing facilities.   Only  limited provision was made in
either project for private sector involvement in processing and marketing.
The heavy reliance on public funding is now receiving more careful scrutiny
for several reasens,  including:   the growing budget subsidy required,  the
political  difficulties  of  raising  seed  prices  to  cover  all  costs,  and
questions  about  the  efficiency  of  puhlc  enterprises  for  this  kind  of
endeavor.  Costs are usually high and production is not as efficient as that
of a farmer whose profession it is to grow crops.  If the farmer is allowed
sufficient incentive for the extra work and  care  to produce  good quality
seed,  he will  genierally  do  a berter  job  and  get  higher  yields  than  a
government-operated farm.   However,  if he has never heen a seel grower he
will need guidance and counsel.
7.09       If  the  private  sector  can  take  on  more  of  the  production,
processing and distribution of certified Feed to farmers, the future role of
public sector  corporations,  such as NSC and SSC,  Is expooted  to focus fn
rapid production and dissemination of certified seed of newly released
varieties,  thereafter  maintaining  and  multipl]ing  stock  seed. (breeder  and
foundation).   As certified seed supplies become adequate, the national and
state seed corporations  and provincial  seed  farms should  phase out their
certified seed production.   A well informed National Seed Board should  by
this time have developed a policy which will providle for adequate cettified
seed supplies through some or all sectors of the private industry.   Tt would
be expected that under favorable conditions the szed industry might reach an
Equilibrium -f approximately 75% private versu,s 25% public  production  and
distribution of seeds.
3.   Sustainahilltv of Private Sector Seed Enterprises
7.10      The private sector includes three main categories of firms:   (1)
cooperatives; (ii) private processors; and (iii) firms with their own
research capacity.   Cooperatives  are primarily tnterested In, and legally
responsible to, their members. In those cases where a coooerative has a seed
enterprise  it generally  takes  one of three forms:   (i) contracting with
grower members to produce seed; (ii) purchase of seed for their members from
outside sources; or (iii) a franchise with a domestic or international plant
breeding firm.   Processors contract for production and market It through a
network of seed dealers in a district or region.   Firms having their own
research program endeavor to concentrate on Fl hybrids which give them an
exc].usive product.   UJsually they do not handle publicly released varieties
since their competition has access to the same varieties and the rnargin of
profit is small.   They have a good marketing system with their own salr-s
force and good advertising.



- 30 -
7.11      The private firms have difficulty in getting prompt information on
availability of public seed releases.   Their representation on the national
seed board is only token.  In both countries the private sector could play a
more important role. However, it needs more encouragement by policies which
would provide it more latitude and flexibility to operate. Competition is a
healthy feature and efforts should he made to reduce and remove the subsidies
to the seed ccrporations which permit them to consistently undersell the
private sector.  Farmers who are knowledgeable of the value of good seed are
willing  to pay a reasonable price for this input.   A comprehensive  seed
extension program is essential both for the seed industry as a whole and for
the farmer-user.
4.   Sustainability through Farmer Participation
7.12      When  allowed  approoriate  incentives,  farmers  are  generally  in-
genious  and  efficient  seed  producers.    With  the  development  of  a  seed
industry there is an opportunity for a new source of income for the farmer
and,  in some  cases,  other  members  of  his  family.    The  evolving  farmer
participation as seed producers in both India and Indonesia is thus seen as a
major factor in long-term sustainability of these modern seed systems.   In
the Tarai, where the farms are relatively large, some of the wheat seed farms
are growing 60 ha for seed on an 80 ha farm and have done so for 20 years.
In Maharashtra State, a typical seed producer had 20 ha and grew cotton,
sorghum and pearl millet for seed.   In this State, which excels in hybrid
cotton seed production, village youth are trained in how to hand-pollinate.
This provides  rural income not otherwise  available.   In Indonesia, where
farms are very small (one hectare or smaller on the average), a group of
farmers (150 ha in one block and 171 farmers) were growing excellent rice
seed crops. They had one person in charge of irrigation, one for fertilizer,
one for pesticides, one for harvesting, etc., and an overall chairman.   The
NSC at Sukamandi has learned that it can cut costs and get more seed by
contracting with farmers than by using the large-scale mechanized estate
apnroach.
5.   Sustainability through Training
7.13      Where   there  were  no  previously   trained  seed   technologists
available, as was the case in Indonesia, full-time consultants for start-up
and   in-service   training   helped   to   rapldly   establish   a  basis   for
sustainability.   By contrast,  in India, where there had been considerable
training in seed technology during the 1960s,  the Tarai project could be
implemented with occasional consultant advice of a few months' duration.
7.14      Academic  and non-academic  training has  provided  further  founda-
tion.   In Indonesia,  a special seed technology training facility has been
established through Seeds II funding and is functioning effectively at the
Agriculttural IUniversity at Bogor.   The seed section of the production divi-
sion of the Directorate General of Foo;1 Crops Agriculture (DGFCA) in
Indonesia  also  holds  regular  In-house  training  on a non-academic  basis.
India is developing seed technology research and teaching programs in several



-  31  -
of  its agriculture  universities.   The Tarai project,  in the interest of
economizing,  cut  out  the  budget  item  for  training.    However,  training
components were included subsequently in National Seeds I and II.
B.   Replicablility
7.15      In spitf of the piocaeering nature of these projects and the prob-
lems encountered,  on balance both projects are considered successful.   In
terms of lessons learned, this raises the question of what can be extracted
from this project experience that could be applied to other projects now
under consideration or in process.   Which aspects depend on the particular
ecological or political and social conditions of these countries, and which
aspects may have broader application?
7.16      The first lesson that can be drawn is that the emergence of new
high-yielding varieties of basic grains was a key factor in establishing
demand for a better seed industry.   Neither farmers, seed growers nor the
government were ready to invest in seed production, processing and distribtu-
tion until something occurred to Jar farmers away from the traditional varie-
ties.   In India, the first stimulus was some success with new corn hyhrids
which, being an open pollinated crop, required particular care in seed multi-
plication.   However, the main stimulus came from two self-pollinated crops:
(a) when the new semi-dwarf fertilizer-responsive, rust-resistant varieties
of wheat from CIMMYT were shown to be well adapted in Northern India; and (h)
when the discovery that the new semi-dwarf IRRI rice varieties would give
high yields in Indonesia, setting off similar excitement among farmers in
that country.
7.17      The second lesson is that multiplication and distribution of a new
variety is not a single occurrence. It initiates a combination of changes in
fertilization, plant density and better moisture control that in addition to
substantial yield increases, will likely create new problems as new varieties
and new production systems are extended over broad areas.  This has occurred
in  both  countries  and  has  required  subsequent  changes  In  varieties  in
response to threatened epidemics of a particular insect or disedse. Special
efforts have been made to maintain genetic diversity by not allowing entire
areas to be planted to a single most productive variety.  Thus, a replicable
seeds program needs to have available the kind of research hack-up from
national scientists and international agricultural  research centers as was
provided to these projects.
7.18      The  plant  pathologists,   entomologists,   agronomists  and  plant
breeders as a team designed the new varieties.   The pathologists and ento-
mologists  designed  techniques  to screen  for  resistance.    The  agronomists
developed management practices to maximize yields.   The plant breeder put
this matrix together based on his knowledge of genetics.   The experience of
national and international research institutions expedited the identification
of  disease- and  insect-resistant  material  suitahle  for  prevailing  condi-
tions.  It also gave the national research Institution confidence and encou-
ragement.



-  32  -
7.19      A third lesson is the use of plant resistance,  conveyed through
seeds to control pests while avoiding damage to the environment.   A compre-
hensive "wheat rust" research program is evolving in India which is providing
wheat breeders with "tools" to scientifically search for resistant germ plasm
to suppress and/or contain future races of rust which will occur in nature.
The integrated pest management approach being used in Indonesia hy Central
Research Institute for Food Crops  (CRIFC) scientists in combatting BPH in
rice  through  their  Genetic  Evaluation  Unit  (GEU)  team  effort  and  an
appropriate halance of resistance varieties, pesticides (as a last resort and
when necessary), biological control and a high level of sanitation in seed
bed nurseries is helping to maintain a desirable environment for mankind.
This  technology  has  encouiraged,   matntained  and  multiplied  biological
predators and disease organismns (fungi) which are natural enemies of the BPH.
7.20      A fourth lesson from these projects refers to the need for a clear
definition of tne roles of the public and private sectors in a national seeds
system.   This Study holds that as a general prinLiple,  the public sector
should give primarv attention to developing appropriate policy which will
encoutrage and expedite a sustainable modern seed industry involving both
public and private dimensions.  The public should also keep primary responsi-
bility for "stock seed  (breeder andi foundatton) of publicly developed varie-
ties and should help to provide reliable and current seed marketing intelli-
gence and trainfng throtugh seed extension specialists.   The public sector
should gradually phase out of cercified seed prodtuction, marketing andl dis-
trihution, and shoulP  encourage the private sector to pick up these tasks.
For  self'-pollinated  crops,  seed  multiplication  by  farmers  for  their  own
futuire  plantings  should  he oncoiiraged  Instead of pushling complete  annual
replacementnt witl!h certifiedi seed.  Tt permtt the development of a useful pri-
vate  seed  -ector  and  thus  improve  the efficiency  of the seed  Industrv,
cubsiditzation of public sector "irms needs to he curtailed.  In this respect,
It is noted tha', both of the countries subhect of this Stuidy have recognized
the neel1 for an expanded private sector role in the seed industry.
7.21      A fifth  lesson  from  these  proiects  is  the  need  for  a  strong
nati.onal seed hoard.  Such an institoition was provided for in both projects,
but it either did riot funclon or emerged very slowly.   By virtue of its
function, an NSB should have top level policy-makers representing the main
public and privrate interests in the seed induistry.   It also needs technical
expertise and a good degree of continuity. Since high level government offi-
cials are frequently rotated to other assignments, to provide continuity the
Executive Secretary of the board could be a professional seed technologist
who presumably,  if well qualifted, would  remain  In this post  for several
years.   The NSB woulH coordinate those aspects OL production, research and
extension dealing with seed and the relation of the seed certification insti-
tution to them.
7.22      The sixth lesson is the key role of the seed certification institu-
tion.   Tnhe farmer's (seed uisers) attitude was changed once he became con-
vinced that the HYVs won'iid oiut-perform his tradittonal seed.  The Blue Lahel
hecnme s-;n<onvr  wis th w li, tiV and h10i- nerformance.  Aiqo, the packaging of

- 33 -
incentive for small farmers as it was not necessary to subdivide certified
bags at retail outlets. The lesson for replicability is that the act of cer-
tifying or documenting each step in the production process is the only way of
assuring the farmer that it is genetically pure seed of the variety identi-
fied on the label. Both countries (India and Indonesia) now have well estab-
lished seed certification institutions.
7.23      The seventh lesson to be drawn from these projects is the need for
better design of seed processing plants.   There is a minimum of expertise
available on appropriate design for conditions of developing countries in the
tropics.   Consequently, there is a tendency to pattern installations after
the large plants which are most efficient in the Western world and hence they
are over-built and too sophisticated.   This was exemplified in Sukamandi.
Also, in both India and Indonesia, locally made equipment was used exten-
sively in order to save money or because of failure to get government import
permits.  Its fabrication was frequently inferior.  The equipment was diffi-
cult to clean between seed lots leading to potential genetic contamination.
The following conclusions are drawn with respect to design and equipping seed
processing plants:
(1) the best equipment available is the soundest investment;
(ii) plant size should be .elatively small--perhaps 5,000 tons or less,
and not more than 10,000 tons per year;
(iii) all work areas, receiving aprons and drying yards should be of high
quality concrete to avoid crumbling, which automatically becomes a
source of contamination;
(4V) when buildings are constructed with funds from one donor and equip-
ment is provided by another donor, there should be carefully coor-
dinated advance planning so that the most efficient configuration
of equipment is used and the building is sized to conveniently
accommodate It; and
(v) a well-qualified consulting engineer, knowledgeable in seed tech-
nology, should remain on the assignment until the plants are fully
operable and a well-trained national counterpart is ready and
qualified to take over.

TIME SERIES ANALYSIS OF SEED I PROECT
IN INDONESIA

INTRODUCTION
The World Bank Impact Evaluation Report about India Tarai Seed
Project (loan 614-In) and Indonesia Seed I Project (Credit-246-
Ind) concluded (among others) that the Tarai PPAR were that the
project had been generally successful and the computed ERR at the
time of project completion was 18% compared to 17% estimated at
appraisal.   The main finding of the PPAR for Indonesia Seed I was
that it fell short of its production goals, particularly during
its  early years.   The PPAR written in 1979 considered  Indonesia
Seed I only marginally successful and the recomputed ERR at
completion was 11% versus 58% estimated at appraisal.
Development program is a dynamic process where time horizon
becomes important to link the project operational stage or life
and its continuing impacts in the post project period.   Realistic
estimation and assumption and time series analysiF can complement
above PPAR cross section analysis to measure and more clarify the
complete dynamic impacts of the project.
The  high estimated economic rate of return at 58%  for  Indonesia  iSee
Credit  246  was  considered unrealistic,  therefore  IBRD  report   comment
number PA85A page 22,  April 26, 1971 also suggested alternate ERR   in
at  20%  and 15%.   The lowest estimated ERR at 15%  at  appraisal   para.
should  not dramatize the difference between the estimated ERR  at   2.17]
58% versus the achieved ERR at 11% at the project completion.
Segmented of time series analysis into four stages should be
fairly justified which are consisted of: (a) learning process
1971-1978,      (b)      transition      stage      1978-1981,      (c)
progressing/developing stage 1981-1990 and  (d) established  stage
atter 1990.
This time series analysis does not necessarily disputes against
financial evaluation analysis in PPAR which is purposely excluded
in this time series scope.

II.  THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF SEED PROJECT IN INDONESIA
(a). Learning process (1971-1978)
The learning process is characterized by: (a) low productivity
(b)  high  investment  (c) slow adoption of new  technology  being
introduced (d) insufficient number qualified and skill human
resources.
Due to these identified characteristics, the project was assisted
by team of consultant to supervise and directly managed the
operation  of Seed Project,  particularly in Sukamandi.   In  this
learning experience stage, project preparation and construction
was implemented some what delay compared to the schedule plan.  It
was found al.-o the big scale mechanized technology being utilized
with   Western  Oriented  Model  of  Farm  corporation   was   not
appropriate.
Four components of Seed Development System (NSB, CRIA, SCCS, and
Seed producer) in Indonesia were trying to synchronized each other
functionally to start establishing a network system in this
period.
(b). Transitional Stage (1978-1981)
Transitional stage is clharacterized by: (a) uncertainty and
(b)  unstable  project  performance.   However,  the  progress  of
proJect development allready indicated fairly increasing trend.
In this stage, full project and supervision were already
in the hand of Indonesian personels.   The transitional period was
relatively short and there were a lot of adjusment ana correction
with regard to particularly the functioning of National Seed
Institutions in the Network.   This stage was soon followed up  by
the progressive/developing stage.
(c). Progressing/Developing Stage (1981-1990)
The period is characteristized by stable and sharp rising trend
of (a) productivity and eficiency (b) volume of seed being sold
(c) high response of farmer on certified seed (d) supporting
institutuions and facilities being strengthened and (e) growth of
seed grower number was in optimum nature.
Complemented with other socio economic inovation at farm level,
the National rice production steadily increase at high rate
(6.58% /annually).  This stage is estimated to be continued  untill
1990,  whereby  t.he targf-ted cerfified seed at 75,000 ton annually

All of the time series analysis are proven by the following
figures and information.

* Private growers
Yield level was recorded in Ton/ha. The average yield at the
National level was significantly changed from time to time. In the
beginning of the learning process (1971), the yield level was 1.01
ton/ha and slightly increased at 1.02 ton/ha in 1972 after that it
extremely decreased to 0.21 ton/ha in 1973. It was due to the
damage caused by Brown Plant Hopper. At the end of the learning
process (1978), the yield was also decreased to 0.50 ton/ha only,
due to suffered by Brown Plant Hopper. At the same time, the cost
of production increased at the peak level (Rp 43.67/kg),this was
attributed by the low level of yield.
In  the  transitional  stage the  average  yield  was  almost
increasing  steadily untill 1984.  During that time the production
cost  gradually decreased,  however,  it slightly increased  again
during the progressing stage (1981-1990) and it reached at stable
condition in 1985 and 1986. During 1981 to 1984, the average yield
gradually increased from 1.64 ton/ha to 1.92 ton/ha.
Production cost was recorded in Rp/kg and since the current
rupiah value changed from time to time, it was necessary this
value to be depleted against price index of the other 8 food
commodity values.
In the first stage (learning process) the depleted production
cost gradually increased fr-vn Rp 20.71/kg (1971) at seed grower
level and reached Rp 43.67/kg in 1978.
Effective production management at private seed grower level
in the transition and development stages made it possibJe to
reduce production cost and finally reached Rp 31.64/kg in 1984.
N National Seeds Corporation
In the learning and transition stage, the yield /unit of area
of NSC was similar compared to the seed grower. The performance of
NSC in the developing stage (1981-1984), indicated that the yield
of NSC increased sharply (figure 1). The highest certified yield
was 2.92 ton/ha (in 1984).
Unfortunately this significant technical performance did not
cause reduction of production cost', but in the other hand it's
production   cost   was  remained steadily  coincided  with  lower
selling price compared to private seed growers ( Figure 2 and 3).

The situation of NSC R/C ratio unfortunately was only 0.5,
it met that NSC was continuing in lost. Mean while the private
growers, although their technical performance was lower compared
to NSC, their financial business indicated their R/C was 1.7. The
unefficient financial management of the NSC was claimed due to
policy and pioneering oriented business, therefore this financial
empirical evidence may direct future seed programme operation
All of certified seed produced is totally distributed and sold
over. National Certified seed production level was below 1000 ton
at the early period of the learning process and gradually
increased to the peak level at 6,496 ton in 1976. This level of
producti.on decreased again at 3,106 in 1978. Data in Table 1
definitely shows the increased of certified seed production in the
transition period and then this level of product-ion jumped in the
developing stage at 94.35% growth annually.
This trend of production behaviour was similarly happened in
NSC  (sang  ilyang  SPri)  within  the  respected   stages  of  the
development . This coeficient and information mark that in the
progressing/developing stage, trend of production is characterized
by higher efficiency (see figure 1 and 4).

Specific total sales volume of NSC during the learning period
(1972 -1978) was 17,233 tons. The average growth per year was
72.5% if 1972 sales was included, otherwise it would only 13% if
1972 sales was excluded.
Problem encounter during this period are as follows:
(a). Risk of unsold seed was still high, because farmer's
perception on seed quality (certified seeds) was still low. Most
farmer were still variety uriented.
(b).   Risk  of  losses because of several and sudden  change  in
varieties recommended by Government or demanded by farmer, due to
pest and deseases outbreak.
(c). The marketing pattern was not well established yet (the
marketing system was still passive).
In the transitional stage, (1978-1981), NSC total sales
volume was 19,077.4 tons. The average growth per year was 26%. And
in the development or progressing stage, the accumulative total
volume  increased  significantly at 51,546 tons. It was  indicated
that the supporting system for seed development in this stage was
became  more  stable and strongly established.The growth  of   NSC
sales was 38% in this period.
Total National sales in the learning and transition period
had   similar  trend  compared  to  NSC  sales.   However  in  the
progressing/developing stage (1981-1985) the total National sales
grew much more vigorously compared to NSC sales. (Fig. 4 )

4. Seed Grower Development (Kxcluded NSC)
The growing number of area being utilized for seed production
in the private sector reflects to the profitability of seed
business.   Free  and  heavy  competition  naturally  screen   out
uncapable  seed  growers, efficient seed grower on the other  hand
remained stay in the seed business.
This healthy rice seed business generates tremendous increment
of certified seed production being sold in the progressing period
as indicated in Table 1.

Number of seed grower almost did not change, where in the
1978 (end of the learning process) they were 1249, in the end of
transition stage (1981) number of seed grower were 1078 and this
number was recorded as 1268 farms at the end of 1984.
Meanwhile the average area being planted by each seed grower
was increasing significantly from 3.62 ha in 1978 move to 6.54 ha
in 1981 and reached 8.82 ha in 1984. It is clear on Table 2 and
Figure 2 that in 1984 there were 2370 famiiies (including 1102
seed traders ) engaged in seed business network. This fact is one
of the measure of multiplying socio economic long term impact of
Seed I project.

5. Software infrastructure.
The historical evidence of the Institutional Building and
quality of human resource development, had been dramatically
improved during the progressing stage (1981-1985). Particularly
the working mechanism among each components (National Seed Board,
CRIA,SCCS and Seed Grower) in the seed development program was
strengthened and well synchronized.
Number   of  qualified  personels  involved  directly   and
indirectly  in seed development program increased sharply  in  the
progressing   stage.   Number  of  University  graduates  were   6
(including 3 person holding Phd degree) in 1978,  compared  to  29
(including 6 persons holding PhD degree) in 1985.
All of those scientist and qualified technicians were in the
Government Institution (CRIA, University, SCCS, Government Seed
Farm). Qualified Technical personels in the NSC were 388 persons
in 1978 and increased to 688 person in 1985. In the same period
persons engaged in the private seed business was 3406 (1978), and
in 1985 was recorded as 5254 persons.
The sharp increase of qualified person was resulted from
intensive training implemented internally and overseas graduate
study  program.  Seed  quality  improvement  training  itself  was
accounted for about 50 to 60 each year from 1976 to 1985.

IV. Future outlook
It becomes clear from time series analysis that seed I
project had no doubtly successful in the technical management
either in the terms of yield per ha or total national certified
seed being sold and planted by rice farmers.   The other indicator
of success is healthy and profitable seed business at seed grower
level particularly in the progressing stage.   The crucial problem
at NSC is that selling price of certified seed is much lower
compared to production cost.
Adjustment due to Integrated Plant Protection policy and
pioneering oriented business are two main factors claimed as the
cau3es of unprofitable high economic cost of NSC.
In  this  regard  Government subsidy helps NSC  stay  in  seed
business. Subsidy is always justified for early stage of strategic
business with future feasible in its ERR (for example seed I
project). Therefore serious concideration should be taken for NSC
business expansion in the future, since this expansion will bring
continous consequence of expanding government subsidy too.
The multiplying positive socio economic impact at rice farm
level has not been assesed.  Further research in this respect will
clarify   more   about  the  multiplying  socio  economic   impact
coefficient to the beneficiaries.
