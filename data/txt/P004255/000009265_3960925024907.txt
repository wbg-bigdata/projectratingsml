PROJECT COMiPLETION REPORT
MALAYSIA
KRIAN-SUNGEI MANIK INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1632-MA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Inttiduction
The Krian-Sungei Manik Integrated Agricultural Development Project
was approved in November 1978. It covers 30,560 ha of padi lands of which
24,000 na are located in the northern district of Kerian and the remaining
6,560 ha in Sungei Manik, in the southern district of Hilir Pevak. The
target group under the project is 24,100 padi farm families.
Obhectives
The major objectives of the project were:
(a) to increase farm production and subsequently increase average farm
income of 24,100 farm families through increased yield of padi
from 2.4 t per ha to 3.5 t per ha, 5 years after project
completion;
(b) to increase cropping intensity from 157% to 190%; and
(c) to increase farm income from sources other than padi. It was
envisaged that the farmers' income would be increased from M$140
per month per farm family to more than M$300 per month per family.
The major components of the project were to rehabilitate and improve
existing primary and secondary irrigation and drainage systems, construct
additional tertiary and quaternary canals and drains as well as the
provision of farm roads for transportation of agricultural produce and the
setting up of an integrated technical support service based at Farmers'
Development Centers.
Project Implementation
The major constraint prior to project implementation was a two-
year postponement in the starting of the major contract works as compared
to that in the Staff Appraisal Report. Inexperienced civil contractors at
the initial stage of project implementation and social resistance by
farmers were some of the problems encountered. Project implementation took
four years longer than expected, while project costs almost doubled.
Agricultural Performance
Padi production had increased moderately in the project area.
Annual production of padi had risen from 117,200 t before project to about



- iv -
153,110 t in 1984. The increment in production had reached about 412 (or
35,910 t) of projected increment of 87,600 t expected at full development
equivalent to annual production of 204,800 t.
Yields per hectare increased substantially from 2.55 t in 1978 to
about 3.5 t in 1985.   However,  yields fluctuated from season to season in
consonance with weather conditions and pest and disease outbreaks. It is
estimated that the average yield per season will be in excess of L t per ha
by 1992.
Cropping intensities in both areas improved by 81 to 11%,
averaging about 165Z five years after project startup. It is anticipated
that by project completion in 1987, cropping intensities of 170Z will be
easily attainable. However, project targets of 190X would be attained by
1990.
Rate of Return
The overall economic rate of return (ERR) of the project based on
1984 data was estimated at 5.4%, much lower than the appraisal estimate of
20%. The lower than expected ERR at completion is largely due to the heavy
fall in rice prices.
Sustainabilit'
It is expected that appraisal production targets can be easily
achieved and exceeded once the infrastructure is properly used and
maintained and farmers have made the necessary adjustments to improve crop
husbandry standards  (para.  7.2).    Although  farm  incomes  have already
increased, this is largely a result of government oubsidies; sustainability
will in part depGid on Government's ability to continue such subsidies.
Findings and Lessons
The implementation period for an irrigation and drainage project
in a low-lying coastal area cannot be shortened without negative effects on
the project.
When designing substantial drainage improvements in low lying
areas with long practiced negative irrigation, farmer resistance to change
can  substantially  delay  project   implementation   and  benefits.    New
technology should not be introduced on a large scale without sustained
pilot testing under project-like conditions as farmer acceptance is
paramount.
A Project Management Unit which is basically a coordinating body
for various executing line agencies is ineffective unless given appropriate
authority since the priorities of line agencies do not always coincide with
those of the Project Management Unit.

BANK OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        The attached project completion report (PCR), prepared by the
Malaysian Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), was received in early March 1987.
This overview, based on the PCR and a review of Bank files, highlights aspects
of project implementation, expands on a number of development issues and
assesses government and Bank performance. The comprehensive, well prepared
PCR contains detailed project documentation, an economic evaluation and
- tically examines several major issues.
n   lights
2.        Implementation of this 30,560 ha drainage and irrigation project
(24,000 ha in Krian and 6,560 ha in Sungei Manik) took four years longer than
expected, while project costs almost doubled. Delayed execution of civil
works was due to: a larger than anticipated and time consuming land acquisi-
tion program due to a design change for tertiary canals; late contract awards
(partly due to inexperienced project staff); inexperienced contractors in
areas with sustained high water levels; some delays in drainage works; and
resistance by the farming community to changes in irrigation and drainage
practices.
3.        Agricultural support services were satisfactorily provided through
the strategically located integrated Farmer Development Centers from which
system operation and maintenance, agricultti-al extension-based on the T&V
system-, input supplies and credit requirements were coordinated.
4.        Despite the civil works delays, padi production increased by 30% by
late 1984 when most coastal compartments in Krian and sge of the sections in
Sungei Manik continued to practice negative irrigation,- which precluded the
planting of high yielding, semi-dwarf, nitrogen responsive and early maturing
padi varieties. When th'e Krian scheme has been completed and commissioned,
and farmers accept the required water management regimes, padi production
should easily exceed appraisal targets.
5.        Social constraints were underestimated during project preparation,
appraisal and in the early project years. Negative irrigation allowed farmers
to grow padi in deeply flooded fields (using floating or roadside nurseries),
l/ Negative irrigation is the supply of water from drainage canals.



- vi -
without constructing bunds to contain water within individual fields. When
tertiary drains were constructed farmers resisted the lowering of drain levels
which required them to construct bunds. Furthermore, many farmers live beside
the drains, which serve not only as a source of water for padi-fields and
domestic use but provide fish and vegetables, for which they wished continued
high drain water levels. Project management, partly on the urging of Bank
supervision missions, worked hard from 1984 onwards to educate and motivate
the farming community (assisted by local leaders and politicians) and it is
now expected that the project ca81 be commissioned and fully operative by 1990.
6.        Farm-family incomes have risen substantially, and are likely to
increase further when modern padi growing techniques are uniformly adopted and
provide the present government subsidies for padi growing continue (free
fertilizer, low interest credit and a substantial padi bonus).
7.        Due to the substantial cost overrun, late completion of project
works and only partial adoption of modern padi growing techniques, and low
international rice prices projections, the ERR of the project is unsatis-
factory (see para. 2.5, Banlk Overview).
Project Background and Objectives
8.        The Krian Irrigation Scheme, in northwest Perak was constructed
(inclusive of the Bukit Merah Reservoir) in 1906. It assured water supplies
for about 24,000 ha, although water control and drainage was inadequate for
reliable double cropping of padi. The 6,560 ha Sungei Manik Scheme in
Southern Perak, completed in 1939, suffered from inadequate infrastructure and
required considerable land leveling to achieve satisfactory padi yields and
cropping intensities. The Bank-assisted project resulted from a 1974 consult-
ancy study financed by the British Overseas Development Ministry. This was
augmented by the Federal and State DID for technical irrigation/drainage
components, and the Federal DOA and FOA and state agencies prepared the agri-
cultural components. Project appraisal was in late 1977 and effectiveness was
declared in March 1979.
9.        Through irrigation and drainage improvements, an increased farm road
network, and the introduction of integrated agricultural support services the
annual padi production of some 24,100 farm families on about 30,560 ha of padi
land would increase by some 75% to 204,000 tons of padi per year, doubling
farm family incomes to about MS300 per month.
10.       The project further provided for some additional DID buildings and
for the construction or upgrading of Farmer Development Centers (FDC) and
subcenters, from w'ich all irrigation operational staff, as well as agricul-
tural extension, credit, and inputs supply staff, would serve the farming
community. Staff houses were to be contracted and vehicles, equipment and
materials procured. Additionally, the project provided funds for a Muda dams
safety study by a consortium of local and foreign consultants.

Project Preparation and Effectiveness
11.       Following the 1974 consulting study, the State and Federal DID, with
little outside assistence, designed the works for both schemes.  At appraisal
detailed designs for 2 out of the 8 Krian compartments and for about a third
of the Sungei Manik area had been completed and land acquisition plans for
1978 had been submitted to the Land Office. Appraisal issues (November-
Dece%.ber 1977) were: intensity of tertiary canals in one large block with
permeable soils in Sungei Manik; the availability of an early maturing rice
variety to allow effective double cropping; the need for design consultants;
retroactive financing of completed works; and the inclusion of the Muda dams
safety study. A follow-up appraisal in March/April 1978 resolved the
outstanding issues. The appointment of the required design engineers (staff
and local consultants) by DID was made a condition of Board Presentation and
it was agreed that the Muda dams study should be included in the project.
Negotiations took place in September 1978 and after loan signing on
December 13, 1978, the Project was declared effective on March 6, 1979,
following delayed appointiaents of the Project Director and Project Steering
Committee. Retroactive financing of the foreign exchange component of
expenditures incurred after appraisal on irrigation and drainage works and the
Muda dams study was agreed. The implementation period was to be the then
standard five years from 1978 to 1983, although the November 1977 Feasibility
Study proposed a seven year implementation period.
II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION 1/
2.1       There were early implementation delays due to land acquisition
problems, (for almost double the lots than originally envisaged) and
inexperienced staff and contractors (paras. 2.10, 4.4 and 6.10). There was
also a major change in tertiary structure design (para. 2.11). At appraisal
it was agreed that the 325 km of approved structural tertiaries (glass-
reinforced polyester or GRP flumes) would be installed above ground, requiring
little right of way and lowering investment costs. However, due to poor
experience with the use and maintenance of GRP flumes and rising production
costs, most of the tertiaries constructed were in-ground concrete lined
canals. Implementation of early scheduled civil works was delayed by about
two years. Contracts for secondary canals and adjacent road improvements were
awarded ahead of tertiary works, which resulted in substantial delays in
availability of improved water supplies and drainage. Once the tertiary
drains were completed, farmers were reluctant to lower the water in the drains
as in the past they had always used these to flood their padi fields; the
drains were also used for fishing, etc. It took several years to get the
farming community to agree to lowering drain water levels (para. 6.3).

- viii -
2.2       At Project Completion (end CY 1985) about 85% of the Krian area
could be supplied with irrigation through tertiaries (para. 4.32), although
many of the tertiaries remained under utilized due to farmer resistance (para.
6.3). By late 1986 about 81Z of the 222 km of planned tertiaries were
completed, several years later than anticipated. Late completion of drainage
in the seaside compartments of Krian was largely responsible for delayed
agricultural benefits. Only when water cculd be fully removed from the very
soft (almost constantly flooded) fields, could improved agricultural practices
and short strawed padi varieties, which respond well to nitrogen application,
be used. It is only after complete drying of the soil that mechanization is
possible. In summary, a combination of factors--late mobilization of
inexperienced contractors; late land acquisition; late contract awards for
concrete lined tertiaries (due to a design change); late completion of
tertiary drains by Area Farmers' Organization (AFO), in particular in coastal
compartments in Krian; inexperienced project staff in early years; and farmer
resistance to change--caused a four-five year delay in the estimated
completion of the project.
2.3       The Muda dams safety study was satisfactorily completed leading to
some further improvements. To comply with international dam safety standards
the Bukit Merah reservoir embankment was enlarged and a second spillway con-
structed at total costs 11 times greater than anticipated (para. 2.11-c).
Fluctuating upstream water releases to the Sungei Manik necessitated the con-
struction of an additional regulating reservoir (para. 2.11-d). Uneven land
in Sungei Manik required land leveling of 1,200 ha (cost M$2,200/ha), far more
than was envisaged with the planned above-ground structural tertiaries
(para. 2.11-g). Building construction was less than anticipated silce FOA
received ADB finance for mechanization centers (para. 2.11-e). However,
construction costs exceeded estimates substantially due to inflation.
Project Costs
2.4       Estimated total costs to December 31, 1987, when all works will be
completed are M$272 million (US$118.3 million), 97% above appraisal estimate
in US$ terms (Annex 2). High inflation, significant increases in civil work
quantities (concreted lined in-ground tertiaries, greater expenditures on main
and secondary canals, more reservoir works, etc.) and an eleven-fold increase
in land acquisition cost, together with longer than expe.cted implementation
which increased staff costs, were the main reasons for the cost overrun.
Through full commissioning in December 1990, costs are expected to increase to
M$293 million (US$128 million), more than double the original estimate. The
cost of tertiary development, together with roads and bridges in Krian alone,
was five times appraisal estimate. In mid-1980 a 66% increase in project cost
was projected, during a period of high inflation and after the need for design
changes was established.
Economic Rate of Return
2.5       Based on the PCR costs and benefits, and the January 1987 rice price
projections, the estimated ERR is negative. However, if the rice price
projections used at appraisal had remained unchanged the revined ERR would be
acceptable. Realized and potential padi production largely offsets the effect



i ix -
of much higher project costs - it is the dramatic fall in rice prices which
adversely affect the ERR.
Disbursement
2.6       Except for the final project years, disbursements were close to
schedule.
Procurement
2.7       There was less ICB procurement than envisaged due to the cancella-
tion of GRP tertiaries and substitution with concrete lined tertiaries. Pro-
curement of vehicles and equipment followed standard procedures.
Project Management
2.8       A Project Management Unit was established to coordinate project
implementation which was guided by a Steering Committee. This arrangement
worked reasonably well, although it was recognized that the Project Director
lacked the authority to get timely approval from the various implementing
organizations (para. 6.4 and 6.7). This was mostly resolved following lengthy
consultations with the agencies in 1981 by the Project Director and which
resulted in the preparation of a Services Operation Manual. The Project
Director was further assisted by a Planning and Implementation Committee which
met monthly to make forward plans and resolve issues. Unfortunately there was
little staff training due to heavy workload and lack of courses offered
(para. 2.11-f).
III. ACHIEVEMENTS
3.1       Although project works were completed later than expected, benefits
from completed areas were quickly evident. Large areas are at present,
however, inadequately drained and cannot benefit Sully from available modern
padi varieties and production methodologies until the project area is fully
commissioned in 1990. Early yield and cropping intensity improvements to 1984
are reported in the PCR for irrigation areas in Krian and Sungei Manik
(paras. 4.9 to 4.15). These do not reflect achievements in areas where posi-
tive irrigation with modern varieties and technology are used. Padi yield
increases of 33% and 49% are reported for Krian and Sungei Manik respectively,
while cropping intensities increased by 8% and 11% respectively. Overall,
padi-production increased by 31% over a six year period to 1984 from 117,200
tons to 153,100 tons.
3.2       With improved staffing, the agricultural extension service (State
DOA) introduced a modified training and visit (T&V) extension system. Farmers
were reached through 388 farmer groups on a regular basis. Area Farmer
Organizations (AFO), organized by the Farmers' Organization Authority (FOA),
increased membership by almost 37% over a five year period to 1985 when two-
thirds of the 24,000 farm families had become members (para. 4.18). Farm
inputs were available for both members and nonmembers through AFO's at Farmer
Development Centers. The demand for credit was restricted to land



x 
preparation, planting, harvesting and some agro-chemicals. Fertilizers were
free of charge. Credit repayments were bothersome, both to AFOs and the Bank
Pertanian Malaysia (paras. 4.20 and 4.30).
Sustainability
3.3       It is expected that appraisal production targets can be easily
achieved and exceeded once the infrastructure is properly used and maintained
and farmers have made the necessary adjustments to improve crop husbandry
standards (para. 7.2). Although farm incomes have already increased, further
increases are likely if padi prices remain favorable and Government subsidies
continue.
Government Performance
3.4       Late staff appointments for design and supervision of works caused
initial delays, together with land acquisition which was also hampered by
early staff shortages (para. 6.9 to 6.11). Adequate local funds were made
available in most years. The Fifth Plan includes adequate funds to complete
and commission the works. Cost overruns and delays related to tertiary
development works cannot be fully blamed on Government because design changes
were necessary. It was unfortunate that farmer non-acceptability of drainage
improvements was not recognized earlier so that a more timely education
program could have been developed (para. 6.3 and 6.12).
Bank Performance
3.5       The appraisal projections for completion of civil works were overly
optimistic; the project preparation report scheduled a seven year development
period. The decision to use glass-reinforced polyester structured above-
ground tertiary flumes, made with insufficient operating and maintenance
experience, proved unacceptable to farmers and costly, due to high oil
prices.
3.6       Farmer resistance to change from negative to positive irrigation was
seriously underestimated by the appraisal and early supervision teams. Bank
supervision missions were infrequent at certain periods.
IV. LESSONS LEARNED
4.1       A seven year implementation period for an irrigation and drainage
project in a low lying coastal area was optimistically condensed into a five-
year funding program, which could not be achieved.
4.2       When designing substantial drainage improvements in low lying areas
with long practiced negative irrigation, farmer resistance to change can
substantially delay project implementation and benefits.
4.3       New technology should not be introduced on a large scale without
sustained pilot testing under project-like conditions as farmer acceptance is
paramount.



- xi -
4.4       A Project Management Unit which is basically a coordinating body for
various executing line agencies is less effective unless given appropriate
authority since the priorities of line agencies do not always coincide with
those of the Project Management Unit.

PROJECT COMPLETION RErORT
MATAVSTA
Krian-Sungei Manik Inteated Area Development rroject (Ln. 1632-MA)
I.  PROJECT BRIEF
A.  Project Background
Project Areas
I.I. The project comprises two areas namely Kerian and Sg. Manik
separated physically by a distance of 193 km each with
their  own separate identities in terms of   infrastructure
development and socio-economic evolution. The Kerian Irri-
gation Scheme lies in the district of Kerian in the ncrth
some 1,500 ha. extending to the state of Penang, and the
Sg. Manik Irrigation Scheme is located In   Southern Perak.
The project covers paddy areas of about 24,000 ha. in
Kerian and 6,560 ha. in Sg. Mar.ik (Refer Map la and lb).
Topography
1.2.  The  Kerian  sub-project  is situated on an  alluvial plain
which slopes gently from about 4m. above MSL at the Bukit
Merah Reservior, to about 0.8m. at the coast in Kerian
Laut, for a distance of about 29 km. The flat terrain is
drained by the Kerian and Kurau rivers, the lower reaches
of which are bun .d to reduce flooding. Coastal areas were
subject  to  direct  salt  water  intrusion  before   being
protected by a bund along the entire length of the coast.
The Sg. Manik sub-project area slopes more sharply with an



elevation of about 12ni above MSL near the headworks and
about 2m at the flood protection bunds along the Perak
River.    The topography is more undulating and steeper near
the headworks than in the lower portion.
Soi ls
1.3.  Kerian Laut, the coastal portion of the Kerian sub-project,
consists  mainly of alluvial soils of marine  origin.   The
inland area, Kerian Darat, consists mainly of alluvial
soils of riverine origin. All soils in Kerian are suitable
for rice growing, but the soils in Kerian Laut have a low
load bearing capacity which may restraint future mechani-
zation. The lower fiat slopes of Sg. Manik have alluvial
clays and the higher areas consist of sandy clays. The
soils are suitable for rice growing although the lighter
soils  require proportionately more irrigation  water.   To
optimize   yield  on the  undulating  coarser  soils,  land
levelling and high rate of fertilization are necessary.
Farm Size
1.4. The average size of the 20,500 farms in Kerian is about 1.2
ha.  with 1.0 ha. of paddy land.   The average farm size of
the 3,600 farms in Sg. Manik is 2.4 ha. with 1.7 ha.
utilized for paddy.



-3
B. Project Objectives
Objectives
1.5. The main objective of the project was to increase and
improve the productivity of farm holdings and subsequently
to increase the income of 24,100 rural farm families in the
project area. The three major specific objectives were:-
(a)   To increase average yield of farm holdings  from  2.4
tons/ha to 3.5 tons/ha;
(b)   To increase cropping intensity from 157% to 190%;
(c)   To increase farm  production from crops  other  than
paddy.
1.6. It was envisaged that the average farm family income would
increase from MS140 per month per farm family to more than
MS300 per month per farm family 5 years after project
comp letion.
C. The Project Components
Infrastructure Development
1.7.  The infrastructure development consists of the following
activities:-
(a) imp.ovements to existing perimeter bunds and tidal
gates including construction of coastal protection
works;
(b) rehabilitation and improvement of existing primary
and secondary irrigation and drainage system and
structures;



-4-
(c) construction of tertiary and quarternary irrigation
and drainage systems and the provision of necessary
structures;
(d)  construction  and  improvement  of   access  roads;
(e) construction, furnishing and equipping of offices and
workshop facilities for DID, DOA and multi purpose
Farmers Development Centres (FDC's), a seed farm, and
staff housing;
(f) procurement of vehicles and equipment for operational
and maintenance of Irrigation and drainage works and
agricultural support services;
(g) provision of local consultant services as required to
assist DID staff for Bukit Merah reservoir improvement
works.
Agricultural Support Services
_____________________________
1.8. The improvement and provision of agricultural support
services of the project are as follows:-
(a) the establishment of three cropping schedules for each
irrigation schemes with enforced staggered planting
dates at monthly intervals;
(b) the introduction of a sound extension methodology, an
increase in extension staff, and the use of continuous
staff training and regular farm visits;
(c)  extending -the coverage  of farm credit  and  mproving
input supplies and marketing facilities;
(d) a limited number of fellowship and overseas training
tours.

II. PROJECT FORMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Formulation
2.1. The engineering elements of the present project basically
consist of the rehabilitation and upgrading of old major
structures (headworks, main canals and drains, perimeter
bunds) and the construction of new systems of distributary
canals, collector drains, and access roads. The original
main structures of the Kerian irrigation scheme (24,000
net paddy ha), including the Bukit Merah Reservoir and the
main canals, were completed ir; 1P6, while the headworks
and most of the main canals of the Sungai Manik Irrigation
Scheme (7,000 nett paddy ha) were completed in 1939.
2.2.  The above two schemes were initially designed to provide an
assured source of water for main season paddy crops and
(with improvements) a substantial amount of double crop-
ping,  and have been continuously upgraded on a   piecemeal
basis and adequately maintained over the decades of their
existence.   However, their irrigation and drainage capaci-
ties were inadequate to provide for the high degree of
water control required for reliable double-cropping of
modern high yielding paddy varieties.   The existing  irri-
gation network and structure were old and water management
was not efficient.   Road access to the paddy areas is also
inadequate for input supply, mechanization, harvesting,
agricultural extension,and operation and maintenance needs.



2.3. The Government in 1974 had commissioned a regional study by
ULG Consultants Ltd., entitled the North Perak Planning
and Development study. Between 1975 and 1977, DID modified
many of the original design concepts proposed in the study
and extended the engineering analysis to the level of
detail suitable for Bank Appraisal.
2.4. Tho modus operandi of the integrated agricultural services
component of the project is a version of the training and
visit extension system adapted to local conditions and
extended  to  cover agricultural credit, water  management,
input supply and marketing, and technical advisory work in
a unified framework. Implementation of the component would
involve close cooperation among the field staff of the
Department  of  Agriculture  (DOA),   Farmers  Organization
Authority  (FOA),    Bank  Pertanian   Malaysia  (BPM)  and
DID, and each of these agencies participated in the prepa-
ration  of  the agricultural program.   The  final  project
proposal for the agricultural extension program, including
supporting technical data, was prepared by the Federal DOA.
2.5.  Socio-oconomic  surveys  of  the  sub-project   areas   and
analysis of  the sub-project  proposals were undertaken  by
the Planning and Development  Division of the  Ministry  of
Agriculture (MOA).



-7-
2.6. The project was appraised in November/December 1977 by a
World Bank mission comprising of Messrs. J. Goldberg,
E. Boereina and G. Thorsky (Consultant) on the basis of a
detailed Preparation Report combining the contributions of
all implementing agencies and coordinated by MOA.
B. Project Implementation
implomentation
2.7. The loan agreement for the above project was signed in
December,   1978 and was made effective then on.   By  early
April,   1979 the Project Engineer was appointed.   However,
progress in civil works was critically delayed due to slow
progress in land acquisition which was in turn bogged down
by massive application of 16,000 lots to be acquired.
2.8.  By the end of 1982, significant progress had  been made  in
major project works. The years 1981, 1982 and 1983 were
fruitful years and by the end of 1983, 72% of project works
were completed (Refer to Annex 1). By the end of 1985, the
Bank loan of M$63.6 million (US$ 26.5 million) had been
fully disbursed.
2.9.  During  the  Fourth  Malaysia  Plan  the  project  was  re-
scheduled to be completed by the end of 1987, that is, a
delay of 4 years, while subsequent commissioning of the
scheme will be completed by the end of 1990.



Problems in lmplementation
2.10. During  implementation  of  the  project, various  problemj
were  encountered  resulting in the delay of   the  project
completion period by 4 years.   Besides a two year delay in
the  commencement  of  major contract        ks,  other  major
problems affecting the delay were as follows:-
(a)  Inexperienced  staff as well as  civil contractors  at
at the initial stage of the project;
(b)  Social   problems,  such   as   planting  of  padi  by
farmers  on  acquired  land  encountered  during   .he
progress of the works.
Revisions
2.11. During project implementation, a number of significant
changes were introduced:
(a) The replacement of about 325 km of proposed tertiary
GRP (glass reinforced polyester) canals with concrete-
lined  canals.   The major reason for the  replacement
was because of the comparatively high cost of maintai-
ning the GRP tertiary canals;
(b)  The construction of 6 feet wide bridie paths along the
excavated drains in order to replace the existing
cement foot-paths;



-9-
(c) The improvement and enlargement of the main embank-
ment of the Bukit Merah reservoir and the construction
of a second spillway to comply with international
standard for safety measures;
(d) The construction of a regulating reservoir as well as
the modification of the Sungai Manik Headworks to
improve irrigation supply to the Sungai Manik sub-
project area;
(c) The reduction in scope of the originally-planned work-
shop which was initially aimed at catering for the
needs of the DID, the DOA and the FOA. In late 1984,
the scope of the workshop was reduced to cater for the
needs  of  DID and DOA  only.    Farmers  Mechanisation
Centre was established to cater for the need of FOA
and AFOs;
(f) The deferment of staff training was due to factors
such as the heavy work load   and the lack of  courses
offered to project staff;
(g) The introduction of infield land levelling of farmers
lots in Sungai Manik due to the undulating field
conditions which were above the Full Supply Level
(FSL) of the canals; and
(h)  The  construction,  of field tertiary irains  has  been
increased in '.rler to further improve farm lots



- 10 -
drainage  facilities  i.e.  aiming   for  better  land
preparation for future farm mechanisation.
Project Cost
2.12. Table I indicates the comparison of the appraised project
development cost and the actual amount spent. The original
project  cost  of   M$144.394  million   was  increased  to
M$272.031  million   when   reviewed  in  1980   after  the
completion of all the project planning and design works.
This meant a cost overrun of 88% from Appraisal estimates.
The cost increase was attributed to the increase in quan-
tities for civil works due to changes in project scope,
and unexpected increase in compensation for land acquisi-
tion and inflation resulting in increased labour cost and
cost of building materials (Refer Annex 2).
Under the Fifth Malaysia Plan. an additional MSZI million
was requested for the maintenance of the completed infras-
structures up to the year 1990 including commissioning of
of the works. The above requirement is based on rates of
MS120/ha per annum for the entire commissioning of works up
to 1990.

The actual disbursements were at par with the expected
disbursement schedule except for the year 1979 which was
the first year of the project. Initial delays in project
implementation was the cause of reduced disbursement for
the  period.   Disbursements  were  completed  by  1985  as
scheduled in the Appraisal Report (Refer Table 3).

Performance of Contractors and Suppliers
2.14. In  accordance  with  the original procurement  plans,  the
supply and installation of the structural tertiary canal
systems in the entire project area were grouped under
one   international  competitive  bidding  contract.    The
remaining irrigation, drainiage and road works were grouped
into locally competitive bidding contracts. Force account
work which Included the fabrication and supply of aluminium
roller gates and gears for  tidal control  structures  were

were executed by DID Federal Workshop in Ipoh. Agricultural
equipment and vehicles were procured under international
competitive bidding. Small off-the-shelf items were pro-
cured under the normal government procedures (Refer Annex
3).
2.15. All the original procurement plans were followed closely
except the supply and installation of tertiary canal system,
in which the conventional concrete lined canals were used
under local competitive bidding instead of international
competitive bidding contracts.

Ill. FINANCIAL FERFORMANCE
A. Financial Requirements And Actual Expenditure
3.1.  Appraisal  cost  estimates  in terms of amount  as well  as
scheduled expenditures differed significantly from actual
amount utilized. Expenditure was re-scheduled, stretching
four years longer than originally planned and terminating
in 1987. At Appraisal, the cost for commissioning was un-
allocated for. An additional sum of M$21 million was pro-
posed and included in the project submission under the
Fifth Malaysia Plan and subsequently approved in principal
by GOM.
3.2. When the irrigation and drainage system is finally commi-
ssioned in 1990, it is estimated that total development
cost overrun  will be 103% over  initial  estimates.   How-
ever, operational costs were 22% over initial estimates
(Refer Table 4).

3.3. The GOM had allocated substantial funds throughout project
development period. In the initial two years, expenditure
were rather slow wherein about 70% in 1979 and 79% in 1980
of allocated sums were spent. Lack of experienced staff as
well as slow progress in land acquisition were the main
causes  of  delay  then.   Even while the  GOM  was  having
budgetary constraints in late 1982 and early 1983 due to
the onset of world economic recession, substantial funds
were allocated to the project to enable completion of works
according to revisions made in 1980.
3.4. The Kerian sub-project incurred a major cost increase. The
factors that contributed towards cost increase were changes
in scope of works and associated increase in quantity of
civil works; increase in compensation for land acquisition,
increase in labour cost and increase in cost of building
materials. These alone incurred a cost increment of MSI15
million (or 177% cost overrun) over Appraisal estimates.
The Kerian sub-project accounted for approximately 67% of
total development cost of M$293 million. On the other hand,
the Sungai Manik sub-project experienced a relatively
moderate cost increment of MS9.2 million (or 43.6% cost-
over-run) over Appraisal estimates (Refer Annex 4).



- 18 -
B. Economic Reevaluation
3.5.  In the following economic reevaluation exercise,a number of
assumptions considered at Appraisal were revised to reflect
changes in line with current developments. Projected values
used  in the analysis were based on 1984 data.   Details of
the three main assumptions employed are as follows:
(a) Cropping Intensity
It is assumed that both areas will achieve cropping
intensities of 190% by the year 1993.
(b) Average Yields
By the year 1993, average yields in Kerian sub-project
are expected to stabilise at 4.2 ton/ha (Appraisal
estimate 2.8 ton/ha) while Sg. Manik sub-project will
average 4.1 tons/ha (Appraisal estimate 3.3 tons/ha).
The above projections take into consideration current
trends in yield increments and inherent capability of
soils and improved agronomic practices in both areas
(Refer Annex 5).
(c) Costs of Paddy Production
Costs of production for both seasons are assumed to be
similiar with the exception of cost items influenced
by yield quantities such as cost of harvesting (which
is 20% of yield) and cost of transportation (which



- 19 -
varies   with  amount  transported).  The other  major
factor   influencing   costs  will  be  mechanisation.
Mechanised ploughing and harvesting in Kerian sub-
project  is   expected  to  increase by  60%  and  30%
respectively after the year 1993. Mechanisation in
ploughing  and harvesting operations is  expected   to
be even more widespread in Sungai Manik sub-project
achieving 100% and 90% respectively after the year
1993 (Refer Annex 6a - 6e).
3.6.  Based  on the  above assumptions and discounting costs  and
benefits over a 25 year evaluation period, the overall
Economic  Rate of Return(ERR) of project is   re-calculated
to be 5.4%, much lower than the Appraisal estimate of 20%.
The ERR for Kerian sub-project is 4.4% (compared to 21% at
Appraisal) while the ERR for Sg. Manik sub-project is
10.8% (compared to 16% at Appraisal) (Refer Annex 7).
3.7.  The  main  factors  contributing  towards  a  lower  ERR is
the   substantial   increase  in   development   cost  which
increased from M$144 million to M$272 million (excluding
cost of commissioning) equivalent to 88% increment over
over Appraisal estimate.    The major  portion of  the above
cost increment (M$115 million) involved the Kerian sub-
project while the Sungai Manik sub-project incurred a
moderate cost increment of MS9.2 million. In addition, the
projected prices of paddy used in the economic analysis are
very much lower than the appraisal estimates.

IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
----------A---P----ject---Manageme------t
A.  Project Management
Project Management Unit
4.1. Agricultural Operational Manual was prepared for coordi--
nated actions by implementing agencies. The initial phase
was   crucial  in   the  context  of  socio   economic  and
political factors usually associated with project implemen-
tation.   The role of DOA through the T & V system; and FOA
through AFOs played an important role by getting the
message to various levels of local leaders.   Social resis-
tance to change were largely contained with the establish-
ment of 388 farmer groups under the T & V system for
effective communication at the grass-root level.
4.2.  The Project Management Unit was established to co-ordinate
project   implementation.    The  main  agencies   directly
involved in implementation are DID, DOA, FOA, BPM, MARDI,
LPN and Land Office.
4.3.  The  Project  Director  was guided by a steering  committee
jointly chaired by the Secretary General of MOA and the
State Secretary of Perak.   The steering committee  decided
on all matters pertaining to policy as well as deliberated
on  major issues in project implementation.   The committee
comprised  representatives  of  key  central  agencies   at



- 21 -
Federal  and State level.   The committee met quarterly  to
monitor project implementation. This committee was inturn
assisted by the Planning and Implementation Committee at
the project level which met every month and chaired by the
Project  Director.   Members of this committee comprised of
heads of components, chairmen of all area co-ordinative
committees and General Managers of AFO's.
Staffing
4.4.  Lack  of  adequate   experienced   personnel  was  a  major
constraint in year one of project implementation.   DID and
FOA were able to fill only 58% of posts established, while
DOA and the Project Director's office had 77% and 85%
respectively. For the project as.a whole, 62% of the posts
established  were filled in 1979 (Refer Annex 8).   In sub-
sequent years, an average of 90% of established posts were
filled and maintained.
Staff Training
4.5. Staff training under the project loan was minimal due to
budgetary constraints.
Agricultural Services Operation Manual
4.6. The problems of co-ordination of implementing agencies were
recognised early in the implementation of the project.



- 22 -
Exhaustive consultations between agencie.i were organised in
1981 by the Project Director resulting in agreement on the
various aspects of horizontal as well as vertical co-ordi-
nation; the results of which were summarised into a booklet
entitled:   "The  Agricultural Services Operation  Manual'.
The manual wan further revised in March, 1985 at a workshop
organised by the PMU.
Formulation of Key Indicators
4.7. The Project Monitoring and Evaluation unit was established
in  1984.   Representatives from the Implementing  agencies
helped to formulate the list of key indicators suitable for
monitoring  progress  and  performance  of  project.    The
original list of key indicators were subsequently revised
at a workshop organised by MOA in mid 1985.
S. Agricultural Impact
Cropping Pattern
4.8.  Total paddy area   remain unchanged except for a negligible
decline due to land acquisition for project works. The
changes in cropping pattern are summarized in Annex 9.
Paddy Yields
4.9. Average paddy yields in the two subproject areas have
increased substantially as compared to the period before



- 23 -
the  project.   In  Kerian,   average  yields  per  hectare
increased by about 33.3% from 2.55 tons in 1978 to more
than 3.4 tons in 1984 and in Sg. Manik it was about 48.8%
from 2.15 tons to more than 3.2 tons over the same period.
4.10. Yield Increase was mainly due to the adoption of high-
yielding paddy varieties (such as MR 1, MR 10, MR 27, MR
52. MR 71 and MR 77) by farmers. Other contributing factors
include the increased use of fertilizers, better agronomic
practices, the use of younger seedlings and better pest and
disease  control.    Yields also increased significantly  in
areas where good water management were practised.
4.11. The targeted average yields per hectare of 3.7 tons for
Kerian sub-project can be achieved by project completion in
1987 whereas the targeted yield of 3.2 tons for Sg. Manik
sub-project had already been achieved in 1984. With commi-
ssioning and improvements, yields in excess of 4 tons per
hectare per season could be attained by 1990  ( Refer Annex
10).
Cropping Intensity
4.12. The average cropping intensity In the sub-project areas was
projected to increase by 33% from 157% to 190% to be
achieved in 1993, that is 5 years after completion of the
project. In 1984, cropping intensity in Kerian rose from
157% to 165% (comprising 95% In the main season and 70% in



- 24 -
the off-season) while in Sg. Manik it rose from 157% to
188% (comprising 94% in the main season and 74% In the off-
season - Refer Annex 11).
Paddy Production
4.13. Tutal  paddy   production  had  Increased  moderately  from
117,200 tons before project to about 153,110 tons in 1984 -
an increase of about 30.6% over 6 years (See Annex 12).
The present production had reached about 74.8% of the
target and an annual production of about 204,800 tons as
targeted in the Appraisal Report is expected to be achieved
at full project development in 1993. Annual production had
increased steadily except for the off-season crop of 1982
which  was  heavily infested with black paddy  bugs,  stem-
borers and red virus disease coupled with unfavourable
weather conditions.
Crop Schedules
4.15. Three staggered paddy cropping schedules were proposed in
the Kerian sub-project area.   Schedule I involves compart-
ments A, B and C, schedule 11 comprises compartments D, E
and F, and schedule Ill is  for compartments  G and H.  The
schedules were set to enable harvesting to take place in
the drier months of June - August and December - February.
Cropping season had been successfully reduced  in  Compart-
ments C, G and H from 8 months per season in 1983 to about
7 months by the 1985 main season crop.



- 25 -
Seed Production
_______________
4.16. With project completion, total seeds requirement would be
600 tons per season to be provided by DOA. Seed production
had generally improved as from the first season of 1984 on-
wards with 67.28 tons (or 53.8% of seed requirement per
season), dipped in second season 1984 with 52.15 tons but
improved significantly for the first season crop of 1985
with  84.35 tons  or  67.5%  of  seed  requirement   (Refer
Annex 13).
Pest and Diseases
4.17 The onslaught by black paddy bug, rats and red virus
disease occured in 1981 and 1982 largely due to the
staggered  planting   and  pest/disease  build-up   brought
about by contruction works which disrupted the cropping
schedules.    The  low  figures  for  1978  to  1980  may be
attributed to under reporting as the Plant Protection Unit
was not fully operational at that time.
Farmers' Participation
4.18. Farmers' participation in AFOs increased significantly with
project implementation. Achievements were above national
averages. Over a five year period, membership of AFOs rose
by  36.6% from 11,634 in 1981 to 15,893 in 1985.   In 1985,
84% of the farmers were members of AFOs and by 1987, the
rate is expected to increase to 88%.



- 26 -
Commercial Activities
______________ ______
4.19. Share capital increased significantly and rose by 179% over
the five year period with annual average increments of
35.8% (1981 - 1985) and is expected to reach $1.0 million
by 1987.   Average share per member improved by an  average
of 10.2% annually over the five year period and is expected
to  double the value by the year 1987.   All the seven AFOs
were involved in the supply of farm inputs to their members
and non-members. Sales turnover doubled annually over the
five-year period (1981 - 1985).   However,  in the next two
years,growth in this sector is expected to taper off as the
market is nearly fully developed.
4.20. Only  a  small  number  of  farmers   made  use  of  credit
facilities  up to a sum of M$4,000 made available.by  AFOs.
Credit   given  out by AFOs is expected to decline  in  the
future. Poor repayments from members were the main concern
of the AFOs.
4.21. Investment by AFOs to purchase shares of the state FA's,
National Farmers Association and MARA increased annually by
47%  over  the  five  year  period  between  1981   - 1985.
Investment per member as at the end of 1985 was M$46.43
which was insignificant. Growth of assets improved annually
by 48% over the five year period of 1981 - 1985,with total
assets of M$6.0 million by the end of 1985 (Refer Annex 14).



- 27 -
4.22. One important development in recent years was the move to
legalize the farmers units so that they could operate their
respective  projects  on their own.   This  strategy  would
enable   greater  farmers'  participation  in   development
projects and prepare the unit leaders to play a more effec-
tive role as development agents of change.
Program of Bank Pertanian Malaysia (BPM)
4.23. In the early years up to 1984, the Bank operated through
Local Credit Centres (LCCs). The LCCs were made respon-
sible for the dissemination of information, distribution of
application forms, the initial processing of applications
for loans, giving recommendations to them helping to
disburse money and full responsibility for debt collection.
The final approval of loans was, however, at the discretion
of the Bank.
4.24. The performance of the LCCs were most commendable in the
early years, particularly, if judged from the collection
point of view.   However, collection rates had deteriorated
from almost 100% in 1982 to 67% by 1983. Subsequently, the
LCCs  were  demotivated  by  the  program  and  many   were
reluctant to continue as they felt the renumeration given
to them were inadequate. Their monetary compensation was
1.25% out of the 4.25% interest charged by BPM on such
loans.



- 28 -
4.25. Consequently, the Bank experimented with direct lending to
farmers in the Gunung Semanggol/Selinsing areas in the
Kerian  district in the first season of 1984.   This proved
practical and more effective in terms of coverage.   By the
second seasoni of 1984, direct lending became the only
method employed.
Number of Loans Approved
4.26. It was observed that the number of loans approved was
highly  fluctuating and irregular.    In the 14 seasons from
1/79  to 2/85, the range in terms of loan approval was from
a high of  4249 to a low of 404. The average was 2736 !eans
per season representing approximately 20% of all farmers in
the  area.   The  total number of loans approved in the  14
seasons was 38,300 (Refer Annex 15).
4.27. There was a marked increase in the number of approvals from
1981 onwards. The increase was mainly due to:
(a) The abolition of interest rates for paddy loans made
them more attractive to potential borrowers,
(b)   The opening of  this program  to all  paddy  farmers.
Prior to this, only members of the Area Farmers Orga-
nizations could qualify for loans provided by the
Bank.



- 29 -
Coverage
4.28. The number of hectares financed by the Bank was positively
and closely correlated with the number of loans approved
which in turn fluctuated greatly from season to season.   A
record high of 7,018 hectares was financed in 1/84 as
against 629 hectares financed in 2/80. The total number of
hectares  financed  in the 14 seasons was 53,410   with  an
average of 3,815 hectares per season.
Amount Approved and Disbursed
4.29. Amount approved per season depended almost entirely on the
number of loans approved.   Hence, as  expected  the amount
also fluctuated significantly. The highest sum approved was
M$3.177 million while the lowest was only M$O.155 million
for  the seasons 2/84 and 2/80 respectively.   The  average
amount approved per season was M$1.6 million and the
average amount approved per loan was MS575.   In  terms  of
amount per hectare, It averaged M$413.   Disbursement  was,
on the average 93% of approved amount.
Collection
4.30. Collection was far bett:tr in the earlier seasons. For the
first four seasons in the period 1/79 to 2/80, the rate for
each season was at least  94.8%.   From  1/81 onwards,  the
Bank started to experience deteriorating collection rates.



- 30 -
The lowest collection rate was in 1/83 when it amounted to
only 66.7%. Thereafter steps were taken to improve collec-
tion and this brought it back to the  80%  mark.   Overall,
the collection rate for the period 1/79 to 2/85 was 80.8%.
Impact of Credit on Farmers' Well-being
---------------------------------------
4.31. It was most unfortunate that inspite repeated dissemination
of information on the program and full encouragement, only
about 20% of the paddy farmers in the area had responded to
BPM's credit. Reasons identified for the low coverage of
farmers were as follows:-
(a) Self-sufficiency in working capital;
(b) Non eligibility of credit from the Bank due to non-
reFiyment of loans;
(c) Reluctant to apply for loans due to reiigious beliefs;
and
(d) Cumbersome process of obtaining credit.
C. Technological Change
Water Management
4.32. With the completion of the canal system up to secondary
level, irrigation water can now be more precisely appor-
tioned through the off-take control structures and by 1985



- 31 -
up to 85% of the area can be supplied positively i.e. from
the canal, a substantial increase compared with only 50% in
1981. However, by 1985 direct access to irrigation supply
for individual farm lots could only be achieved for about
60% of the area while the rest, mostly in Compartments A, B
& C would gradually be provided with similar facilities as
the construction of the tertiary canal progresses. By 1987,
80% of the farm lots should have individual access to
direct supply from canal.
4.33. As evidenced from Compartment G where all infrastructures
up to tertiary level had completed by end 1984, irrigation
supply ( ficiency had markedly increased.  Where it used to
take about 6 weeks to flood the field to a depth of lOOmm
(4 inches), the completed system needed only 3 weeks to
achieve the same result, an essential factor in making
double cropping possible.
Mechani sat ion
4.34. The problems associated with inadequate drainage were the
major constraints to any programme promoting mechanisation
in the Kerian sub-project. The negative irrigation drainage
system designed in the early 20th century was adequate for
a single-crop of paddy cultivation in Kerian with little or
no provision at all for the eventual use of heavy farm

4.35. In the Kerian sub-project cultivation by tractors commenced
only in the second season of 1985. In the first and second
season of 1985, about 7.9% and 4.4% of the area was culti-
vated  by powertillers  respectively.   Cultivation,  using
tiactors constituted a small portion of about 40 ha in the
second season of 1985.   The use of combines for harvesting
constituted only 2.8% and 8.7% in the second season of 1984
and  first  season  of  1985  respectively.   Mechanisation
depends on weather conditions and availability of  machines
from Selangor and Kedah (Refer Table 5).

4.36. Mechanisation of field operations in Sg. Manik sub-project
is becoming the norm of the region as 74 - 95% of the areas
were ploughed by machines while only 32 - 42% of the areas
were harvested by machines due to unfavourable weather
conditions  and  non-availability  of  machines  from   the
surrounding areas.
Research Activities
___________________
4.37. At appraisal, research programme was envisaged to concen-
trate on developing high yielding disease resistant paddy
varieties with growing period of 135-145 days to enable
eventual double-cropping. Selection of varieties suitable
for organic muck and acid sulphate soils and refining
fertilizer and pest control recommendations were the other
activities included. Farm machinery modification tests and
research into ways of reducing post-harvest losses were the
other major areas of concern of MARDI in the project area.
4.38. Every season, between 500 to 900 line of paddy were planted
for  selection yield trials and adaptability  trials.   The
variety MR 52 was bred in MARDI Kerian and released as
recommended specific-ally suitable for Kerian. Other varie-
ties used in Kerian since 1979 were MR 1, MR 7, MR 10,
MR 27,  MR 47,  MR 71,  MR 73 and MR 77.   Of the varieties
mentioned above, MR 10 and MR 77 attracted the interest of
farmers.   Currently, potential *'arieties under test are MR



- 34 -
82,  MR  84 and MR 85.   These varieties,  in spite of their
dwarfism, are capable of high yields in several locations
in Kerian Barat. The yield of some varieties are shown in
Table 6.

4.39. Problem soils in the project area included acid sulphate
soils and saline soils. Varieties with potential for acid
soils are MR 10, Improved Mahsuri, MR 52, MR 71, MR 77, Y
635, Y 636, MR 82, MR 84 And MR 85. Varieties potential
for saline soils and problem soils due to sea-water
intrusion are MR 10, Bahagia, MR 71 and MR 77.
4.40. A two wheel ploughing machine (Yanmar) had been success-
fully modified to work soft soils and under deep-water
conditions.   The  modification  included attachment  of  a
vacuumed star-shaped cage-wheel capable of ploughing while
floating.   Losses  due to harvesting and threshing in  the
project area was high amounting to 18.8% (5.1% while har-
vesting and 13.7% while threshing). A further 1% of grains
was lost with the  thresh.   Research on method  to  reduce
post-harvest losses is currently on-going.
4.41. Apart from research carried out by MARDI, field demonstra-
tions by DOA in direct-seeding were very encouraging with
special reference to compartment G where initial yields
were high.   The major constraint  to recommend large-scale
direct-seeding method was the lack of proper water manage-
ment which was critical for the success of this practice.



- 37 -
D. Farm Income And Poverty Redressal
Farm Income
4.42. In estimating the real income of farm families items such
as returns to family labour and value of paddy consumed by
farm families were considered as income received.    Sources
of income for farmers in Kerian and Sg. Manik were grouped
under three categories viz: income derived from paddy
cultivation; income derived from non-paddy farm act.,.vity
and income derived from off-farm jobs (Refer Annex 16).
The trend indicated of continued dependence of farmers to
paddy cultivation as the main source of income, while
income from off-farm jobs was reduced by about 12% by the
year 1984. Additionally, income from non-paddy activities
(inclusive of income from poultry, fish culture, vege-
tables, fruits, etc) ir.creased by about 7% over Appraisal
estimates.
4.43. In  the Sg.  Manik sub-project,   the  main source of income
was again from paddy planting. However, income derived from
other sources was substantial.    Increased  contribution by
off-farm income (betweon 5-10% over Appraisal estimates) to
total income showed that farmers in Sg. Manik generally had
more opportunities for off-farm jobs compared to farmers in
Kerian.



- 38 -
Poverty Rodressal
4.44. At Appraisal, approximately 70% of project beneficiaries
familie- lived on total income below absolute poverty line,
while nearly 100% lived in relative poverty, making them
the poorest paddy areas in the west coast of Peninsular
Malaysia.   With project implementation, incidence of abso-
lute  poverty  amongst farmers had  been  eradicated.   The
incidence of relative poverty too had been substantially
reduced to about 33% of total farm families in Kerian and
31% in Sg. Manik by the year 1984 (Refer Annex 17).
E. Performance Of World Bank Officers
4.45. Generally, the Bank Officials were keen observers of tech-
nical aspects of flaws in civil design and civil construc-
tion works being implemented and their suggestions on ways
to overcome technical implementation problems were most
useful.   Completing the project on schedule was their main
emphasis.
4.46. Professional suggestions by Bank Officials on matters per-
taining to extension and agronomic practices by farmers
were  received  with reservations as solutions to  problems
put forward by Bank Officials were difficult to be imple-
mented immediately.    However,  their views were taken into



- 39 -
consideration   in  planning  the  project's   agricultural
support services.
4.47. The enthusiasm showed by Bank Officials and their total
involvement in project issues during missions is commen-
dable.   Occasional pessimism  showed by Bank Officials due
to slow progress in technology transfer to farmers might be
due to their lack of indepth understanding of socio-
economic   and  political  conditions  of   local   farming
community.

V. SPECIAL ISSUES
Water Rates
5.1. The imposition of water rates is governed by the Irrigation
Areas Ordinance 1953.   The Ordinance does not specify  the
rates that should be levied nor does it lay down maximum or
minimum charges. However, it makes provision for the impo-
sition of different rates on various classes of land in the
gazetted areas. The existing classification and the corres-
ponding water rates in the State of Perak and Penang are as
follows:-
Land Classification         Water Rates (M$/Acre/Annum)
…__ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Perak         Penang
Class A, Yield more than            $4.50        $6.00 (S)*
400 gantang/Acre/Crop                            $9.00 (D)**
Class B, Yield between 250          $3.00        $4.50 (S)
and 400 gantang/Acre/Crop                        $6.75 (D)
Class C, Yield less than            $1.00        $3.00 (S)
200 gantang/Acre/***crop                         $4.50 (D)
5.2.  All land within the  project area, except 202 ha  in Siang
Aik Area, Kerian, have been gazetted as irrigation areas,
where the imposition of the above water rates are appli-
cable.   This gives a maximum annual collection of $354,000
in the entire project area, assuming that with the current
project inputs, all land can eventually be reclassified
into Class A.
* (S) - Single Crop
* (D) - Double Crop



- 41 -
5.3. The rates are low compared with the capital outlay and sub-
sequent annual recurrence cost in operation and maintenance
of the irrigation areas. In 1966, a memorandum was prepared
by the Ministry of Agriculture and Co-operatives recommen-
ding for revision of the water rates. However, for social
and economic reasons, the rates have practically remained
unchanged.  The existing land classification and the  water
rates in the Sg. Manik Sub-Project area are as follows:-
Water Rates
Land Classification                     (MS/Acre/Annum)
Class A, Yield more than 400                     $4.50
gantangs/acre/crop
Class B, Yield between 250 and                   $3.00
400 gantangs/acre/crop
Class C, Yield less than 250                     $1.00
gantangs/acre/crop
5.4.  The  gazetted irrigation area in Sg.  Manik Is 6,611 ha and
the expected annual water rates to be collected is $50,000.
The water rate is low and even though the paddy yields have
increased, there is no proposal at present to increase the
water rates.
Maintenance of New Infrastructure
5.5. The additional fund required for maintenance work is for
the time being provided under the allocation for co,mmisslo-



- 42 -
ning works, which will end by year 1989.   On completion of
construction of infrastructure up to tertiary level, each
irrigation area by compartment is subject to commissioning
works for a period of two years or four planting seasons.
At the same time, commissioning personnel provided by the
project are making up for the manpower need at supervisory
level.   However,  it is deemed necessary by year 1990, the
latest to provide the additional fund required to meet the
annual maintenance cost. Similarly, manpower needs should
be progressively met from year 1988 onwards.
Future of Mechanisation
5.6. Eventual mechanisation of farm operation is one of the
desired changes anticipated for project implementation. The
most serious constraint facing any program promoting mecha-
nisation in Kerian is the low load bearing capacity of the
soil. Other limiting factors identified are inaccessibi-
lity, small farm size, scattered farm-holdings and poor
drainage. With the completion of tertiary drains by 1987,
and allowing three to four seasons subsequently for 'hard
pan' formation, it is anticipated that mechanisation can
be eventually made possible.
5.7. Tate and Lyle (M) Sdn. Bhd. was employed by FOA to carry
out feasibility studies on eighteen proposed FMCs in Penin-
sular Malaysia.   The study identified Bagan Serai and  Sg.



- 43 -
Manik as suitable sites for the establishment of FMC's. The
proposed FMC's when gradually implemented over a five year
period beginning in 1987 will eventually provide 30% of all
mechanisation  needs in the project  area.   The study also
projected the percentage of total area mechanisable up to
the year 1993 as shown in table 7 below:-
Table 7: Total Mechanisable Area - 1987-1993
Area             Manual    Powertiller   Tractor
Coastal Kerian  1987       90%           10%           0%
1993     70%           20%          10%
Upland Kerian   1987       80%           20%           0%
1993     10%           60%          30%
Sg. Manik        1987      10%           45%          45%
1993      0%           30%          70%
5.8.  With the completion of infrastructure by 1987, about 15% of
Kerian area (3,570 ha) could be mechanised with power-
tillers or tractors.   In Sg. Manik, 90% of the areas could
be mechanised by powertillers or tractors in 1987. By 1993,
nearly 100% mechanisation could be .chieved.



44 -
5.9. The major thrust of the project was on infrastructure reha-
bilitation and development as evidenced by the fact that
about 95% of the funds were allocated for this component.
The remaining 5% of project costs were for the provision of
agricultural support services.
5.10. The Project Feasibility Report of 1977 mentioned the need
for sociological research with the view to develop new
approaches to sociological consequences using improved
inputs   and  technologies.      The  socio-economic  aspects
mentioned above are currently under the perview of Project
Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of the Project office and
MOA.   Research on certain aspects of ecological factors of
project impact are included in MARDI's research program for
paddy areas.
5.11. In the future efficient operation and maintenance of infra-
structure provided under the project as well as the
sustained human development of farm families, will deter-
mine the success of agricultural programmes in the project
area.

VI. LESSONS LEARNED
Optimistic Planning of Project Period
6.1. Project proposal as outlined in Main Report Feasibility
Study dated November, 1977 envisaged an overall implemen-
tation schedule covering a 7 year period with design and
planning process completed within 4 years. At Appraisal the
above proposal was revised wherein the project was expected
to be planned, designed and completed within a period of 5
years.
6.2. Taking into consideration the primary irrigation difficul-
ties encountered to enable double-cropping of rice as
discussed in detail in the Feasibility Study Report for
Kerian-Sg.  Manik  project,  it is not  suprising that  the
actual implementation stretched over a period of 9 years.
It would be worthwhile for planners to review the original
Feasibility Study Report prepared by MOA as the original
proposal had taken into consideration the need for an
extended period in planning and designing the project in
view of the nature of constraints encountered.
6.3. At appraisal, one major area of research that was not given
adequate attention was on the various aspects of water
management problems.   As infrastructure construction  were
approaching partial completion in late 1984 and early 1985,
glaring weaknesses in in-field management of drainage water



- 46 -
came to light.   This matter could have been easily  appre-
hended if it had been identified earlier during the
planning stage.
Effoctiveness of Project Maragement Unit (PMU)
6.4. The basic roles played by PMU during project implementation
include as a co-ordinator, as a manager and as a director
of project activities. Inspite of the heavy responsibili-
ties entrusted to PMU, lack of adequate line of authority
to some extent reduced the effectiveness of PMU.
6.5. The PMU assumed the role of a liaison agency between
various  parties  concerned.   The need for a  mediator  or
arbitrator for issues peitaining to implementation problems
concerning the farming communities and the implementing
agencies or local authorities, increasingly demarcated a
role for PMU. However, as a coordinative model such autho-
rity was not provided for.   Since commencement,   It took a
few years before the PMU was recognised by all parties con-
cerned as the most appropriate agency to coordinate project
implementation.   Greater  concern   by  MOA  and   central
agencies in monitoring various aspects of project impact,
led the PMU to take a lead role in monitoring key indi-
cators of project impact, whose guidelines were established
by MOA.



- 47 -
6.6. One source of disagreement is over the choice of technical,
social and economic priorities or over the modus operandi
in  implementation  of project activities.    Generally  the
local expertise over technical, social or economic choice
rested with the various implementing agencies. The involve-
ment of PMU may be construed as interference of depart-
mental roles. The PMU played the unpopular role as an
internal performance auditor as MOA increasingly thrust the
PMU into this role.
6.7. One major advantage of the above role is that the lack
of authority of PMU favoured interest in discussion of
issues. Counter proposals by implementing agencies provi-
ding alternatives to solutions of project implementation
problems were easily forthcoming. This encouraged active
participation of implementing agencies which generally
improved the quality of decisions made.
Lack of Provision for Development
of Other Commidities
6.8. During Feasibility Study, other commodities such as rubber
coconut, cocoa, fruits, short-term crops and live-stocks
were  reviewed.   However,  no concrete proposals were  put
forward for the development of these commodities as supple-
mentary sources of farm household income. During the whole
project period, the development of other commodities such
as coconut, cocoa, fruits and short-term crops, animal



- 48 -
nuFsbandry, fresh water fish culture were left to the etturt
effort of individual agencies.
I    oi i onced Technical Staff
_.9.  Some of the project staff ranging from the level of techni-
cians up to the engineers'level were fresh and thus inexpe-
ri.nced. Due to the heavy workload, there were insufficient
oppurtunities for on-the-job training for the staff. Fov a
massive project of this nature, adequate and experienced
technical staff were of utmost importance especially at the
initial stage of the project implementation.
Inoxperienced Civil Contractors
6.10. At the initial stage of the project, the contractors
engaged for the civil works were quite inexperienced in
handling projects of a massive scale. Prequalification may
be necessary to obtain experienced contractors.
Land Acquisition
6.11. The processing of applications of nearly 21,000 lots of
land to be acquired within a limited period for the
was a burden to the Land Office. Experienced and adequate
staff, together with proper planning and co-operation among
the concerned agencies, are essential to ensure smooth
implementation of land acquisition.



- 49 -
Social Problems
6.12. Many  problems  which  werp  mainly social in  nature  l.&il
encountered during the implementation of the project. Thesc
problems either directly or indirectly had to some extent
hinderod   the  progress  of  the  project.   A  close  .co -
operation   with   local  leaders  and   related   agelncleb
especially district office is very much needed to minimise
such problems and project delay.

VII.  CONCLUSION
7.!.  Proiect  impleinentation  has  drastically  reduced the  risk
factors  involved  in paddy  cultivation  and  significantly
addressed rural  poverty in the project  area.   Substantial
amoujnt  of  intangible  benefits   have  been  generated  by
project implementation: reliable water supply for irriga-
tion; speedy transportation of paddy to processing centres;
reduced after-harvest crop losses due to mechanisation and
availability of agricultural support services at Farmers'
Development Centres.
7.2.  Project objectives in raising paddy yield had been achieved
even before project completion.    Intensive double-cropping
of paddy, one of the major targets of project implementa-
tion   will  be easily achieved as  projected,  five  years
after project completion.
7.3.  Progress  in  institutional development  of AFOs  has  been
significant  and  achievements  are  well  above   national
average.   Currently, the AFO's  increasing  involvement in
commercial   activities   augurs   well  for   the   future
development of AFOs.

Dear Mr. Graham Donaldson,
Re: Project Completion Report on Malaysia
Krian/Sungai Manik Integrated Agricultural
Development Project (Loan 1632-MA)
I acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your letter
dated 30th September, 1987 and the draft copy of the
Project Completion Report (PCR) on the above mentioned
project. The lengthy nature of the report necessitated
considerable time to peruse and analyse before the
Treasury, Economic Planning Unit and the Department
of Irrigation and Drainage were able to submit their
views.
2.     Although I am agreeable to the findings and
conclusions of the main text, I find that certain
writeup in the preface and the Bank overview need
commenting upon. Appended below are the list of
comments:-
2.1.  Preface, Page i, Line 7:  Line  ........

Agriculture' should be amended to '.....
prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture

3.    As one of the main objectives of this report is to
draw lessons from past experience with the objective of
improving future project planning, it is envisaged that
the views and comments be received and incorporated into
the final report hence giving a more even assessment of
the project's experience.
4.    Finally, let me take this opportunity to thank
you for allowing me to express the Government of
Malaysia's views and comments on your draft report.
Sincerely,
(ABU BAKAR MOHD. NOOR)
