KRIAN-SUNGEI MANIK INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:        Malaysia
Amount:          $26.5 million equivalent
Terms:           The loan would be for a period of 17 years, including 4 years
of grace, with interest at 7.35% per annum.
Project
Description:  Major components of the proposed project are:
(a) rehabilitation and improvement of existing primary and
secondary irrigation and drainage canals and structures;
construction of tertiary and quaternary irrigation and
drainage systems; construction and improvement of access
roads; and improvement to existing perimeter bunds and
tidal gates, in two separate subprojects: the Krian
Irrigation Scheme with 23,500 ha and the Sungei Manik
Irrigation Scheme with 6,560 ha of padi land;
(b) construction, furnishing and equipping of offices and
workshop facilities for the Drainage and Irrigation
Department (DID), multipurpose Farmers Development
Centers (FDCs), a seed farm, and staff housing; and
procurement of vehicles and equipment for operation
and maintenance of irrigation works;
(c) provision of local consulting services to assist DID with
the implementation of project works and preparation
of tender documents, and consulting services for a Muda
Dams study; and
(d) a limited number of fellowships and overseas training.
The project would directly benefit 24,000 smallholder families,
creating additional employment for 2,500 people, and would result
in an annual foreign exchange saving of about $15 million through
reduction in rice imports. The major risk in project implementation
would derive from difficulties in organizing and implementing the
agricultural supporting services. However, these services are
already being successfully provided under previous Bank projects
and are expected to be reinforced and fully integrated into the
project by the time of planned full project development in 1989.

Financing Plan:   The proposed Bank loan of $26.5 million would finance the
foreign exchange requirements of the project. The loan
would finance retroactively the foreign exchange component
of expenditures incurred after appraisal (November 1977) on
irrigation and drainage works in the subproject areas, and
the Muda Dams study. The estimated total cost of such
works is $2.4 million, of which $1.2 million (50%)
would be foreign exchange. Because this is a federal
project, all local costs would be borne by the Government
of Malaysia (GOM) throughout the implementation period of
the project. Activities falling under constitutional state
jurisdiction, such as operation and maintenance of the
completed works and agricultural extension, would thereafter
be financed through normal GOM procedures.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO MALAYSIA FOR
THE KRIAN-SUNGEI MANIK INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Malaysia for the equivalent of $26.5 million to help finance the
foreign exchange costs of an integrated agricultural development project.
The loan would have a term of 17 years, including 4 years of grace, with
interest at 7.35% per year.
PART I - THE ECONOMY /i
2.        The latest economic report, "Malaysia: New Perspectives on the
Third Malaysia Plan" (No. 1594-MA), is dated October 14, 1977. Detailed data
on Malaysia's economy are shown in Annex I.
3.        By most economic indicators, Malaysiashas done well in the past
and, in particular, during the Second Malaysia Plan period (SMP, 1971-75).
The per capita income of $860 (in 1976) is among the highest in Southeast
Asia. Public and private investment activity was stepped up and, as a
result, GNP growth, which during the 1960s averaged 6% a year, increased
during the SMP period to 7%.  Moreover, the declining trend in the terms of
trade during the 1960s was reversed during the 1970s, and as a result there
was an acceleration in per capita income growth on a trend basis from 2%
during the 1960s to about 5% during the SMP period. Progress has also been
made in reducing the economy's dependence on rubber, and the manufacturing
sector has performed well in terms of output, employment, and exports. With
a high export component in GNP, the country is very vulnerable to external
fLuctuations, which were significant during the SMP period. In spite of the
increased investment activity and resulting current account deficits in the
balance of payments, Malaysia managed to maintain a strong external position
during the SMP period with relatively low debt service payments and growing
international reserves.
4.        Notwithstanding this good performance, existing racial inequalities
in income and employment, and considerable poverty, especially in the country-
side, persist. The inferior income position of the Malays is related to the
concentration of Malays in traditional smallholder agriculture and their
meager ownership of corporate assets; furthermore, Malays are poorly repre-
sented in the modern industrial sector, especially in managerial, profes-
sional, supervisory, and clerical occupations. The inequalities threatened
the stability of the country and, in 1971, prompted the Government to intro-
duce a New Economic Policy, which is designed to achieve national unity
through the two-pronged objective of eradicating poverty and restructuring
society to eliminate the identification of race with economic function.
/1 Parts I and II are essentially the same as those contained in the corres-
ponding sections of the President's Report No. 2370-MA, dated August 21,
1978, on the Coconut Smallholders' Development Project which was approved
on September 5, 1978.



- 2 -
5.        More specifically, the policy proposes to reduce in a 20-year
period (1970-90) the sharp income differences between Malays and non-Malays
by reducing disparities in the ownership and control of wealth in the cor-
porate sector, and by reducing the concentration of Malay employment in
traditional low-income rural activities, while increasing Malay presence
in the relatively high-income urban sectors. Since poverty is largely
concentrated among Malays, a redressal of poverty would contribute signifi-
cantly to a reduction of the racial inequalities of income.
6.        The principal means proposed to achieve these objectives is a rapid
growth of the industrial and service sectors. This growth will not only
increase average incomes but will also serve the objective of racial restruc-
turing of the labor force. In addition to pursuing a rapid growth strategy,
the Government also proposes to achieve its goals through more direct means:
on the poverty side, mainly through public investment programs directed
towards the poor; and on the racial restructuring side, through controls and
quotas.
7.        In mid-1976, the Government initiated the Third Malaysia Plan (TMP,
1976-80) reconfirming the goals of the New Economic Policy. The major
objectives of the TMP are: (a) to reduce the overall incidence of poverty
(from 44% in 1975 to 34% by 1980, which would mean reducing poverty in the
agricultural sector from 63% to 49%); (b) to increase Malay employment in the
modern sectors of the economy (from the 1975 Malay share of 32% towards the
1990 goal of 50%); and (c) to increase the share of Malays in the equity
ownership of the corporate sector (from the 1975 Malay share of 8% to 16%
in 1980).
8.        The TMP goals are set out in a framework of substantial economic
growth. The target growth rate for GDP is set at 8.5% per annum. Private
investment is targeted to grow about 10% a year and public investment about
6%, resulting in an investment of M$44 billion in current prices over
the TMP period. Public development expenditures were set at M$18.6 billion,
with a higher level of M$20 billion targeted if additional resources became
available.
9.        In addition to following a rapid growth strategy, the Government
proposes to reduce poverty through direct programs that will raise agricul-
tural productivity. In the TMP, one quarter (M$4.7 billion) of total public
development expenditures is allocated to the agricultural sector (compared
with M$2.1 billion or 22% in the SMP). Of this, more than one third will be
spent on increasing productivity in existing agricultural areas. In addition,
one million acres of new land are scheduled for development. As a means of
reducing poverty, the TMP also provides for improved housing and other
essential services for the poor in both rural and urban areas. The TMP also
stresses that greater attention will be given to improving the less developed
states.
10.       Economic information for 1975 and 1976, however, has significantly
altered the macro framework of the TMP. First, there was a larger recovery
than expected in traditional exports and in the terms of trade in 1976, as
well as higher present and prospective levels of oil production. Second, it
now appears that the rate of private investment fell considerably in 1975 and
declined further in 1976.



- 3 -
1.        During 1976, significant increases in exports, both in prices and
volumes, particularly of oil, combined with moderate increases in imports,
resulted in a current account surplus equivalent to 6.2% of GDP. Despite a
reduction in market borrowing by the Government, reserves increased by US$900
million. At the end of 1976, gross official reserves were the equivalent of
about seven months of imports.
12.       Current projections of oil exports and of export prices in general
are higher than those used as a basis for the TMP. Therefore, the resource
outlook for Malaysia is now brighter than was forecast in the TMP. Overall
export earnings during the Plan period should be about $5 billion more than
was forecast. Largely as a result of this increase, public sector revenues
are also expected to be higher by about $3 billion. The likelihood of these
additional resources has prompted the Government to choose the higher TMP
target for development expenditures of M$20 billion (see para. 8 above). If
implementation constraints are overcome, an even higher target could be
set.
13.       While the availability of resources is thus expected to be consi-
derably improved, there is some uncertainty about achieving the Plan's pri-
vate investment targets. As a result of the decline in the rate of private
investment in 1975 and 1976, private investment would now have to grow sub-
stantially faster than the projected 10% rate during the remaining years of
the Plan in order to achieve the Plan targets. While there are a number of
possible factors involved in this downturn in the rate of private investment,
particularly manufacturing investment, it is difficult to determine their
relative importance with any certainty. First, the world recession which
began in 1974, no doubt, had some negative impact in Malaysia on private
investments planned for 1975. Second, 1974 was a peak period for private
investment in Malaysia so that some cyclical decline in the rate of private
investment would have been experienced in 1975 anyway. Third, there was
considerable uncertainty in the private sector regarding the impact of the
Industrial Coordination Act (ICA), passed by the Parliament in 1975, which
enforces racial restructuring targets for equity and employment through a
system of licensing existing and new firms above a certain minimum size.
The Government acknowledged the uneasiness in the business community and
amended the Act in 1976. An important change approved was the establishment
of an appeals procedure. While the initial reaction of the private sector to
these amendments was somewhat mixed, it is still too early to judge their
impact on the longer term investment climate.
14.       Assuming a moderate long-term recovery in private investment,
Malaysia's balance of payments should be in substantial surplus. During the
next five years, the cumulative current account surplus could amount to as much
as 5% of GDP compared to a negligible current surplus in the previous five
years. Since such a current account surplus would be sufficient to provide
for an adequate level of reserves, capital inflows may moderate in the future
At present, about 16% of public debt outstanding and disbursed is from the
World Bank; this percentage may increase somewhat by the early 1980s. Reserves
are also expected to continue to increase slowly, while the debt service on
public obligations is likely to average about 5% of export earnings, slightly
lower than the present level of 7%. The Bank's share of debt service is
currently about 11% and may increase to 12-14% by the early 1980s.



- 4 -
15.       In general, over the next few years, it is likely that the Govern-
ment will need less external capital than previously forecast, largely because
of strong commodity prices and oil earnings. At the same time, Malaysia has
a serious income distribution and poverty problem. The country needs techni-
cal assistance and expertise to help develop poverty alleviation programs and
to assist in designing and packaging projects that reach out directly to low
income families. The Malaysians believe strongly that project borrowing, par-
ticularly from development institutions such as the World Bank, is necessary
to assist them to mount an effective attack on poverty. Bank lending is
therefore focused on strengthening Government efforts to reduce poverty
directly.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAYSIA
16.       The Bank has made 43 loans to Malaysia for projects in education,
population, agriculture, forestry, industrial finance, power, water supply,
sewerage, telecommunications, ports, railways, roads, and urban transport.
17.       Although in many cases disbursements have been slower than expected,
the execution of Bank projects in Malaysia has generally been satisfactory.
As of August 31, 1978, the loans to Malaysia held by the Bank amounted to
$771.8 million. Seventeen loans have been fully disbursed. Annex II con-
tains a summary statement of Bank loans as well as notes on the status of
ongoing projects as of August 31, 1978.
18.       While currently Malaysia is a resource surplus country, the openness
of the economy (exports being 45% of GDP) and the volatility of the prices
of Malaysia's main exports (rubber, palm oil, and tin) make the continuance
of resource surpluses uncertain. To cushion against fluctuation in exports,
large reserves are needed. With regard to Bank lending, however, the primary
consideration is not resource transfer; rather, it is institution-building
and helping Malaysia to expand its capacity to combat the deep-rooted problems
of poverty and unemployment, particularly in the rural areas.
19.       Malaysia's commitment to assist its low-income groups has strength-
ened significantly in the past few years. The Bank can take some measure of
credit for its efforts to help Malaysia identify and prepare projects geared
toward the rural poor. In view of Malaysia's otherwise weak preparation
capability, the number of rural development projects recently financed and
currently in the pipeline is impressive. Recently, in order to reach a
greater number of low-income households, the Government and the Bank have
been emphasizing in situ agriculture projects, such as those for small-scale
irrigation, integrated rural area development, and agricultural support
services.
20.       While these recent projects are by themselves impressive, they are
not truly representative of the Government's general capacity to develop
projects; this capacity remains very weak, largely because of a shortage of
trained staff. With the help of the UNDP-financed and Bank-executed State



and Rural Development Project, which provides technical assistance to
selected federal agencies (departments) and states, the Bank is helping the
Government to develop further its programs and projects for reducing poverty.
21.       The country needs further assistance to help develop poverty
programs and projects. Bank loans are assisting those in absolute poverty by
strengthening research and extension, by providing on-farm development,
including irrigation and drainage facilities, and other facilities such as
farm-to-market roads. At the same time, the Bank will continue to assist
landless laborers by helping in the development of larger areas of new land
for agriculture. Bank lending will also help improve support services by
expanding extension services, by increasing agricultural and small-scale
industrial credit, and by producing higher quality seeds. The Bank plans to
mount a concerted effort to help such institutions as RISDA (Rubber Industry
Smallholders Development Authority), FELCRA (Federal Land Consolidation and
Rehabilitation Authority), and BPM (Agricultural Credit Bank). It also plans
to help the Government expand social services, particularly for low-income
groups, through assistance for formal and informal skill training and for
expansion of family planning services. Assistance toward infrastructure
development would be very selective, focusing on extending utility and
transportation networks to the rural areas.
22.       IFC has been active in Malaysia since 1963 and has made six invest-
ments totaling $8.69 million. The total commitments under the investments
held by IFC as of August 31, 1978 amounted to $1.34 million (Annex II).
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
23.       Malaysia's agricultural sector occupies a predominant position
in the country's international trade through the exports of natural rubber,
palm oil, hardwoods and pepper. Agricultural commodities generate about 60%
of the country's export earnings and about 30% of GNP. Most of the agricultural
land in Malaysia is under three crops: rubber (58%), oil palm (18%) and padi
(14%). Except for oil palm, areas of all principal crops consist mainly of
smallholdings, although private and public estates continue to play a vital
role in the production of rubber and coconuts. Reflecting world market
conditions, oil palm is gradually replacing rubber in coastal areas, which
are more suited to the former. This trend is evident in both smallholder and
estate production.
24.       Agriculture, which currently employs 49% of the labor force, will
continue to be the largest source of employment, providing about 12% of total
new employment in the long term according to Government projections. The
sector also accounts for the largest number of poor households. According to
Government estimates, 63% of the farm households in Peninsular Malaysia
were in poverty in 1975, with the incidence of poverty rising as high as 77%
among padi farmers. One of the Government's basic policy objectives is to
help eradicate poverty through programs aimed at productivity increases on
existing smallholdings, and by settling people with little or no land on
new land developments. The land development program provides new settlers with
the means to earn a better living, while relieving pressure on already
occupied land.



25.       Rice production is largely confined to irrigated areas in the
coastal plains. The Government has encouraged and maintained support for
irrigation development in order to reduce the country's dependence on rice
imports, and to alleviate the poverty of large padi-farming communities.
About 80%O of Peninsular Malaysia's 370,000 ha of padi land has now been
provided with some forn of irrigation and 57% of the irrigated area is
technically capable of double-cropping. As part of the overall program to
increase rice production in the country, the Government continues to invest
in construction of drainage and irrigation facilities. Under the Third
Malaysia Plan, about 97,000 ha of padi will be provided with new or improved
facilities. By the end of 1980, the area suitable for double-cropping is
expected to increase to 278,000 ha, or 73% of the irrigated area. In recent
years, the major thrust in irrigation development has shifted from construc-
tion of new schemes to providing on-farm (tertiary and quaternary) canals
and drains to existing schemes to upgrade the standard of water control
necessary to increase padi yields and cropping intensities. In conjunction
with upgrading the standards of water control, strong integrated agricultural
services have been provided under recent projects.
26.       The Government is committed to self-sufficiency in rice production,
which, as a result of favorable weather in recent years, reached nearly 90% of
domestic consumption. It has, however, decreased since 1975, mainly due to
unusually poor weather conditions affecting the Muda region. A prolonged
drought in that major rice producing area resulted in an increase in the
import of rice to 18% of domestic consumption in 1977. The level of imports
is likely to rise to over 20% of domestic requirements in 1978. Reversal of
this trend by increasing rice production, especially in areas outside Muda,
is thus a serious national objective.
Institutions
27.       Nearly all Government agencies involved in agricultural development
are in the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), including: the Federal and State
Drainage and Irrigation Departments (DID); the Federal and State Departments
of Agriculture (DOA); the Farmers Organization Authority (FOA); Bank
Pertanian Malaysia (BPM); and the Malaysian Agricultural Research and Devel-
opment Institute (MARDI). The National Padi and Rice Board (LPN), which
regulates the marketing, milling, and import of rice, falls under the
Ministry of Public Enterprise.
28.       DID is responsible for planning and implementation of most public
works in the area of water use and conservation throughout Malaysia, including
irrigation of rice fields, drainage of tree crop areas, flood and coastal
protection and major urban drainage.  The Federal DID, with headquarters in
Kuala Lumpur, is responsible for overall planning and design, while the State
DIDs are responsible for operation and maintenance. The Federal and State
DIDs usually cooperate in the supervision of construction of major projects.
29.      The Federal DOA provides policy guidance and technical support to
the State DOAs. Technical support services to the State DOAs are provided by
Federal branches for crop production, crop protection, soils, agricultural
education, extension, and farm mechanization. The State DOAs are primarily
responsible for field extension services. A recent Bank loan for the National



- 7 -
Extension Project (Loan 1493-MA) is assisting the Government in improving its
extension services throughout the country and in improving seed supplies.
30.       MARDI has been responsible for all crop research (except for rubber)
since 1971. Rice research is problem- and location-oriented, and focuses on
the areas of varietal improvement, plant and crop physiology, agronomy and
crop protection. Through central and location research, MARDI formulates
packages of recommendations for specific padi growing areas and soils. A
Bank loan for the Agricultural Research and Extension Project (Loan 1115-MA)
is assisting MARDI in expanding its research capability.
31.       The Farmers Organization Authority (FOA) is responsible for super-
vising Farmers Associations and Cooperative Societies with the aim of
integrating these organizations into Farmers Organizations (FOs) which are
served from Farmers Development Centers (FDCs) covering from 1,000 to 6,000
farm families each, depending on smallholder density. The FOA provides
credit, supplies inputs, and markets and processes agricultural products
through the FDCs. Marketing of rice is mainly carried out by private enter-
prises but LPN mills in or near the Krian and Sungei Manik subproject areas
have adequate capacity to dry, mill, store and market substantial volumes of
additional padi.
32.       Malaysia's agricultural credit bank, Bank Pertanian Malaysia (BPM),
was established in 1969 to strengthen and coordinate agricultural credit
programs, with particular emphasis on loans for small farmers. It presently
provides short-term credit to padi farmers, and medium-term credit for
purchasing agricultural machinery and for purchase and development of land.
Crop production loans are mainly channeled through FOs, but eligible non-FO
members may obtain these credits directly from BPM. Expanding crop production
credit to the majority of small farmers is one of the objectives of the
proposed project.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
33.        The project was prepared between 1975 and 1977 by agencies in the
Ministry of Agriculture following an initial consultants study financed by
the British Overseas Development Ministry. The project was appraised in
November/December 1977. A Staff Appraisal Report (No. 2032-MA) dated October
12, 1978, is being distributed separately. Supplementary project data are
provided in Annex III. Negotiations were held in Washington from September
11 to 14, 1978; the Malaysian delegation was led by Mr. Abdul Rahim Haji Din,
Deputy Secretary of Finance in the Treasury.
Project Areas
34.        The Krian and Sungei Manik subproject areas are situated in the
State of Perak, on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The Krian subproject
area, in the northwest corner of the state, includes about 23,500 ha of padi
land, farmed by over 20,500 families on individual smallholdings. Limitations
of existing infrastructure restrict the cropping intensity to about 160%,
which in turn limits per capita income to about $200 per annum. The



- 8 -
smaller Sungei Manik subproject area, covering 6,560 ha of padi land in
southern Perak, is farmed by over 3,600 families. While the average farm
size is slightly larger in Sungei Manik than in Krian, per capita income is
similar due to the lower cropping intensity (145%) and larger family size.
The two subproject areas are served by the oldest existing sizeable irrigation
schemes in Malaysia. The small size of the holdings and the inadequacy of
the facilities keep 70% of the people in these areas in absolute poverty, and
nearly 100% in relative poverty.
Project Description
35.       The project would improve the productivity and income of smallholder
farmers in the subproject areas through provision of a high standard of water
control and access within individual blocks of land, and through establishment
of an integrated program of agricultural support services. The average capital
costs of all project works and of vehicles and equipment to be provided under
the project total about $2,000/family ($1,600/ha). Incremental annual costs
of agricultural services at project completion would amount to about $12/family
($10/ha). The main components of the project are summarized below.
36.       Krian Irrigation Improvement.  The Krian Irrigation Scheme was
originally completed in 1906 to provide an assured source of water for a
single padi crop. Over the last two decades DID has implemented a series of
large-scale improvements aimed at increasing the water supply to the project
area. These improvements were designed to guarantee sufficient water to
double-crop the areas fully. However, after 70 years of use, the distribution
and drainage systems have deteriorated to a point where canals and drains are
physically indistinguishable, water levels are the same in the canals,
drains, and fields, and little movement or control of water is possible.
Given these conditions, farmers have been restricted to hardy but low-yielding
padi varieties, and have been able to double-crop their fields only irregularly.
Under the project, main and secondary canals and drains would be enlarged,
and tertiary and quaternary canals and drains constructed throughout the area
to enable rapid distribution and evacuation of water. These improvements
would give 80% of the farms direct access to both canals and drains, permit-
ting the optimal degree of water control by each farmer and eliminating the
flooding of crops now experienced in large portions of the project area.
Existing perimeter bunds would be rebuilt to protect the agricultural area
from river and coastal flooding, and large numbers of tidal gates would be
constructed to permit faster drainage during low tide periods.
37.       In addition to the water control works, DID would construct an
improved system of access roads.  Upon completion of this system, most of the
Krian padi area would be between 0.4 and 0.8 km distant from a motorable
road, which would substantially facilitate harvesting and marketing, input
supply, agricultural extension work, and operation and maintenance of the
irrigation system. The Krian construction program would also include three
new Farmers Development Centers and five subcenters, where offices and staff
housing for the implementing agencies (DID, FOA, DOA, BPM) would be concen-
trated. BPM credit operations, FOA input supply and marketing operations,
DOA extension services, and DID operation and maintenance would all be
organized, integrated, and implemented from these FDCs. Additional workshops,
district offices, and seed stores would also be constructed in appropriate
locations.

38.       Sungei Manik Irrigation Improvement.  The Sungei Manik Irrigation
Scheme was developed in four phases from 1933 to 1953, with the headworks and
most of the main canal system completed by 1941. Most of the physical
problems constraining agricultural development in Krian are also present in
Sungei Manik, but, in Sungei Manik, the steeper topography makes the distri-
bution of water a more pressing problem than drainage. Similar engineering
approaches would be followed in Sungei Manik, with an emphasis on expanding
the capacities of the old headworks and main canals and provision of new
distribution and drainage systems. In addition, the existing Sungei Manik
FDC would be enlarged and two new subcenters would be constructed.
39.       Equipment and Vehicles.  Vehicles, pumps, and excavation and
earth-moving equipment would be purchased under the project to improve the
capability of Perak State DID to operate and maintain completed project
works. The State DID workshop to be constructed under the project would
perform routine maintenance and repairs for this equipment, while major
repairs of heavy equipment and fabrication of parts would be undertaken by
the Federal DID workshop in Ipoh. Agricultural equipment and vehicles would
also be purchased to improve the mobility of DOA extension staff, and to
enable the FDCs to provide transport and tractor services to farmers on a
fee basis.
40.       Consulting Services.  To augment the number of DID staff avail-
able for this project, consultant services including 100 man-months of
engineers, 50 man-months of technical assistants, and 120 man-months of
technicians and draftsmen would be provided under the project. Consultants
would be engaged through a local engineering firm, but would be formed into
teams with experienced DID design staff under the direction of the Project
Engineer. Total costs of the consultant input, including overhead and
expenses, are expected to average $1,230/man-month for engineers, $900/
man-month for technical assistants, and $405/man-month for technicians and
draftsmen. Assurances have been obtained that consultants engaged by DID
for project implementation would be acceptable to the Bank and would be
engaged as required, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank
(Section 3.02 of the draft Loan Agreement).
41.       Training.  The project would include funds for overseas short- and
medium-term training and study tours for selected DID, MOA, DOA and FOA
staff in the fields of irrigation system management and operation, padi
production and extension, and tropical agriculture. Four DOA Subject Matter
Specialists would attend crop production and crop protection courses at IRRI
in the Philippines. Four extension supervisors, four FDC managers, and six
selected personnel involved in executing the project would visit
neighboring countries where integrated agricultural extension services are
being implemented.
42.       Muda Dams Study.  Under the Muda Irrigation Project (Loan 434-MA),
which was completed in 1970, the Bank financed construction of the Pedu and
Muda Dams, which supply irrigation water to the 98,000 ha Muda Irrigation
Area in the States of Kedah and Perlis. The Pedu Dam, a rock-filled, asphalt-
faced structure, has shown excessive leakage, which has already been partly
repaired. Recent investigations indicate that additional technical problems



- 10 -
exist. The concrete-buttressed Muda Dam has also shown some technical
problems, mainly through corroding of pre-stressed anchor cables. The
Government, with Bank approval, has engaged a consortium of experienced
consulting engineers, MINCO of Malaysia and ACE of Pakistan, to carry out a
detailed investigation of the safety of the dams, a pre-feasibility study for
increasing their storage capacity (if safety factors warrant), and a study of
additional potential storage sites for the Muda Project area. The study
requires 44 man-months of expatriate consultant services (at $4,500/month)
and 47 man-months of local consultant engineering services (at $2,400/month).
The investigation commenced in May 1978 and would be completed in December
1979.
Project Cost and Financing
43.       The total project cost is estimated at $60.2 million, with a foreign
exchange component of $26.5 million (44%). Physical contingencies of 15% were
applied for irrigation, drainage and road works, 10% for building construction
and 10% for vehicles and equipment. The expected price increases over the
implementation period amount to 21% of the base costs and assume the following
rates of price inflation: civil works, 7.5% in 1979 and 7% in 1980-83;
equipment and vehicles, 6.5% in 1979 and 6% in 1980-83; and consultants,
engineering and training, 7% for the period 1979-83. The proposed Bank loan
of $26.5 million would finance the foreign exchange requirements of the
project. The Government would finance all_local costs throughout the implemen-
tation period. Assurances have been obtained that activities such as operation
and maintenance of completed works and agricultural extension would thereafter
be financed through normal Government procedures (Section 4.04 of the draft
Loan Agreement). The loan would finance retroactively the foreign exchange
component of expenditures incurred after appraisal (November 1977) on irrigation
and drainage works and on the Muda Dams study. The estimated total cost of
such works is $2.4 million, of which $1.2 million (50%) would be in
foreign exchange.
Procurement
44.       Installation of tertiary canal systems in both subproject areas
would be grouped into one contract, worth a total of about $6.8 million,
which would be subject to international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank Guidelines.  Most of the remaining irrigation, drainage, and
road works would be small and dispersed in time and space, and would not be
suitable for international tender. These works (totaling $36.5 million)
would be implemented through about 15 contracts in Krian and 5 in Sungei
Manik (averaging $1.8 million each), which would be awarded after competitive
bidding advertised locally in accordance with Government procedures. The
local contracting industry is competitive and strong, and local tendering is
well-managed and publicized. Bids would be accepted from foreign contractors
who wish to participate and no preference margins would be utilized in the
evaluation and award of civil works contracts. Buildings and facilities
costing a total of $3.2 million would also be tendered locally.



- 11 -
45.       Equipment and vehicles ($2.9 million) would be procured under
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Guidelines. A
15% preference margin, or the prevailing customs duty, whichever is less,
would be extended to local manufacturers of these items. Small off-the-shelf
items, costing less than $20,000 each and limited to a total of $500,000,
would be procured through normal Government procedures. Force account work
would include the fabrication and supply of aluminum roller gates and gears
for tidal control structures (which would be executed by the Federal DID
Workshop in Ipoh), and improvements to main canals and drains. The total
cost of such work is estimated at $1.1 million.
Disbursements
46.       Disbursements would be made at the rate of 100% against the foreign
exchange expenditures on directly imported equipment and vehicles, 100% of
the ex-factory cost of equipment and vehicles manufactured locally, and 80%
of the total cost of imported but locally procured items. Disbursements for
civil works would equal 52% of total costs. Disbursements for works executed
through force account would also equal 52% of total costs, and would be made
against a certificate of expenditures, the documentation for which would be
retained by the borrower and be made available for inspection by the Bank in
the course of project supervision. For consulting services, overseas fellow-
ships and study tours, and the Muda Dams study, disbursements would equal
100% of total costs. It is expected that disbursements would be completed by
December 31, 1984. The disbursement schedule is given in the Loan and
Project Summary.
Project Coordination and Implementation
47.       All the federal agencies which would be directly involved in the
implementation of the project - DID, DOA, FOA, and BPM - are under the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). While each agency would
be responsible for implementing specific activities within its jurisdiction,
responsibility for coordinating all project activities would rest with a
Project Coordinator in MOA. The Project Coordinator would be guided on
policy matters by a Steering Committee composed of the Secretary General of
MOA, the State Secretary of Perak, and other officials they may nominate.
Such an organization has proven successful in previous Malaysian projects.
Appointment of a suitably qualified and experienced Project Coordinator, and
establishment of the Steering Committee (Sections 3.06 and 3.07 of the draft
Loan Agreement) would be conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan
(Section 5.01 of the draft Loan Agreement). Assurances have been obtained
that the implementing agencies would maintain separate accounts for the
project, which would be collated by the Project Coordinator, audited by
auditors satisfactory to the Bank, and forwarded to the Bank within nine
months of the close of each year (Section 4.02 of the draft Loan Agreement).
48.       DID would be responsible for implementing all project civil works.
Final design work would be executed by a team of key start-up staff including
two senior engineers, three irrigation engineers and four technicians.
To ensure that design concepts are effectively transmitted to the District-
level staff who will eventually operate and maintain the works, assurances



- 12 -
have been obtained that, upon completion of final design, a designer's
operation manual would be prepared (Section 3.10(a) of the draft Loan
Agreement).
49.       DOA would assume primary responsiblity for the organization and
operation of the agricultural services elements of the project, with the
assistance of the Project Coordinator. The agricultural services program is
based largely on agricultural extension, modified to suit Malaysian insti-
tutions and the requirements of the smallholders. DOA staff would be expec-
ted to take the lead in implementing the first step of the program, namely,
organization of the Small Agricultural Units or farmer groups. Groups would
comprise an average of 50 farmers, and each DOA extension officer would visit
16 such groups (or 800 farmers) on a regular basis, once every two-week
period. Group leaders and subgroup leaders would be selected with the
participation of the farmers for water management, credit, and input supply.
During his visit, the extension officer would review the condition of
demonstration plots with the farmers and advise them on the most important
agricultural operations required over the next two weeks, such as choice of
varieties to plant, fertilizer and pesticide applications, timing and tech-
niques of nursery establishment, ploughing, water management, harvesting,
threshing, and drying. DID, FOA and BPM staff would accompany the DOA agent,
as required, to emphasize points of immediate importance related to their
responsibilities. Agricultural Assistants stationed at the FDCs would
supervise six or seven agents and would conduct regular bi-weekly training
sessions for them at the FDCs, supported by Subject Matter Specialists and
senior staff of the cooperating agencies. Field staff of FOA, BPM, and DID
serving the same farmer groups would also attend these training sessions.
Assurances have been obtained that the Perak DOA, in consultation with DID,
FOA, and BPM, would prepare an agricultural services operations manual as a
guide for field extension staff, by September 1, 1979 (Section 3.10(b) of the
draft Loan Agreement).
50.       FOA would be responsible for the expanded input supply and marketing
operations to be provided from the FDCs, while BPM would assume primary
responsibility for increasing the volume and coverage of existing agricultural
credit operations. Assurances have been obtained that the Project Coordinator
would prepare annual statements of agricultural credit requirements to be
submitted to BPM, FOA, and the Bank not later than three months prior to the
beginning of each fiscal year, and the Government would thereafter ensure
that an adequate amount of credit would be made available to farmers in the
project area (Section 3.08 of the draft Loan Agreement).
51.       The project would be implemented over a period of five years.
The agricultural support programs provide for a build-up of staff and faci-
lities over the implementation period. Construction in Krian commenced
in 1977 and is expected to be completed by the end of 1983. Construction in
Sungei Manik would commence in 1978 and be completed in 1982. Assurances
have been obtained that all DID, DOA, FOA, and BPM staff required to implement
the project would be appointed in a timely manner (Section 3.09 of the draft
Loan Agreement).



- 13 -
Production and Marketing
52.       Average padi yields in the subproject areas would increase substan-
tially due to six major factors: conversion from double-transplanting (floating
nursery) techniques to standard wet seedbed techniques; conversion to padi
varieties with higher yield potential; better land preparation with improved
drainage; increased use of fertilizer and insecticide; better timing of
planting and harvesting seasons; and maintenance of more appropriate water
levels during various growth stages. With these improvements, average padi
yields are expected to increase from 2.5 ton/ha at present to 3.6 ton/ha in
Krian and from 2.1 ton/ha to 3.1 ton/ha in Sungei Manik for the main-season
crop, with similar percentage increases in the off-season crop. Total padi
production would increase by 75% from 117,200 tons at present to 204,800 tons
at full development. This would represent an increase of 3% of the total
domestic supply, which, in the present deficit situation, would be easily
marketable within Malaysia.
Farm Incomes
53.       At present the total annual family income generated by the model
1 ha farm in Krian is M$2,484 ($1,035), and for the 2 ha farm in Sungei
Manik is M$2,749 ($1,145). These family incomes, which include incomes
from crops other than padi and off-farm work, are approximately equal to a
per capita income of $200 per annum. The range of per capita incomes derived
from the various sizes of farms is relatively narrow, from the equivalent of
$148 for the 1 ha farm in Sungei Manik to $244 for the 1.5 ha farm in
Krian. These figures should be compared with the estimated national relative
poverty line (critical consumption level) of about $390, the estimated absolute
poverty line of $215, and the national per capita income of about $860.
Approximately 70% of project beneficiary families subsist on total incomes
below the absolute poverty line, while nearly 100% live in relative poverty,
placing the subproject areas among the poorest padi areas on Peninsular
Malaysia's west coast. By full project development, family income on the
Krian 1 ha farm would rise to M$3,321 ($1,384) and on the Sungei Manik 2 ha
farm to M$4,259 ($1,775), equivalent to per capita incomes of $261 and $317
respectively in current prices. Implementation of the project would lift the
bulk of the very poor in the subproject areas (14,000 families) out of
absolute poverty, leaving but 16% of the beneficiary population in that
status. At full project development, no more than 5% of the beneficiaries
would earn incomes above the relative poverty line, entirely restricted
to farmers operating over 2 ha of padi. Given the typically small land-
holdings, this represents the most cost-effective means of dealing with the
poverty problem in the subproject areas (at an investment cost of $2,067 per
family), as well as making the maximum impact attainable through agricultural
intensification with the achievement of reasonable economic rates of return.
The project would provide reasonably large proportional increases in income
(averaging over 36%) to two large communities, while ensuring a sufficient
period of time for the planning and initiation of land settlement, industri-
alization, and other development programs in Perak.



- 14 -
Project Charges
54.       Given the extremely low incomes of the padi farmers in the sub-
project areas, Government policy would require no special taxation of project
beneficiaries to recover project costs. The farmers already pay a wide
variety of land-based taxes and irrigation rates averaging $7/ha, and an
Islamic padi production tithe (zakat) to the Perak State Department of
Religious Affairs, which uses the receipts to finance the religious school
system, teachers' salaries, welfare expenses, and maintenance of mosques.
Zakat payments are an integral part of traditional Malay culture, which
remains an especially strong force in the padi-farming areas, and they can be
expected to continue regardless of general tax policy. Estimated zakat
payments average about $80/ha, and are projected to increase by $60/ha
with project induced yield increases, far in excess of incremental O&M costs.
It should be noted that O&M of irrigation facilities in Malaysia is totally
divorced from collections of either land-based irrigation charges or zakat
payments, that irrigation O&M is financed out of general revenues supported
by a highly efficient and generally progressive tax system, and that the
level of O&M is not constrained by a shortage of funds. In view of these
factors and the level of farm incomes, the present structure and level of
charges are considered acceptable. Assurances have been obtained that the
Perak and Penang State Governments would continue to collect irrigation
charges whose level would be determined taking into account O&M and capital
costs, incentives to farmers, farmers' capacity to pay, and other taxes and
charges imposed upon them, and that the Government would exchange views with
the Bank from time to time on the level of those charges (Section 4.03
of the draft Loan Agreement).
Project Benefits and Risks
55.       The expected economic rate of return of the overall project is 20%.
This estimate is a composite of the estimated rates of return of the Krian
(21%) and Sungei Manik (16%) subprojects. While achieving this favorable
economic return, the project would directly benefit some 24,000 smallholder
families (130,000 people), create additional employment for 2,500 agricultural
laborers, and would result in net annual foreign exchange savings of about
US$15 million through reductions in rice imports.
56.       Although the rate of return is fairly sensitive to shortfalls
in achieving expected yields, shortfalls of over 40% from expected yield
increments would be required to reduce the rate of return to 10%, the estimated
opportunity cost of capital. Given past experience in Malaysia, shortfalls
of this magnitude are highly unlikely. The rate of return is insensitive to
increases in construction costs and lags in project implementation. The
major risk in project implementation would derive from the difficulties in
organizing and implementing the agricultural supporting services. However,
these services are already being successfully provided under previous Bank
projects in Malaysia and they are currently being intensified and integrated
on a pilot basis in Krian itself. There is thus a high likelihood that by
the time of planned full project development (1989) the agricultural goals of
the project will have been successfully achieved.



- 15 -
Environmental Effects
57.       Additional developmental work in the existing Krian and Sungei
Manik irrigation areas would not have adverse effects on the environment.
Drainage improvements in the almost continuously flooded low-lying areas
would reduce the amount of stagnant water and thus reduce hazards from
water-associated diseases and pests. Chemical fertilizers and pesticides are
already widely used in the areas and extension services would continue to
advise against the use of chemicals toxic to fish. Project works in Krian
would protect rather than disturb the coastal mangrove fringe.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
58.       The draft Loan Agreement between Malaysia and the Bank, and the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank, are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. The draft Loan Agreement follows the general pattern
of loan agreements relating to agricultural projects. Special conditions of
the project are listed in Section III of Annex III.
59.       It is an additional condition of effectiveness that the Government
would: (a) appoint a suitably qualified Project Coordinator; and (b) establish
a project Steering Committee.
60.      -I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
61.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

^. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /1
Loan No. 774   Sabah Ports Project; US$16.1 Million Loan of June 302QI97I;
Effective Date: August 24 1971; ClosinR Date: December 31,
1978
Work has been satisfactorily completed on the new berths at Kota
Kinabalu and Sandakan. Slow progress in ccmpleting the access road to
Sandakan delayed full use of the latter facilities until mid-1977. The new
headquarters building has been occupied. Delay in mobilization, procurement
of maLerials and difficulties in retaining suitable consultant engineers,
compounded with the world-wide inflation, resulted in a cost overrun of about
50%. Settlement of an outstanding claim by the contractors will delay the
final account and the closing date of the loan has been extended for six
months to December 31, 1978.
Loan No. 931   Second Hi hway Project; US$19.5 Million Loan of August 22,
1973; Effective Date: October 25, 1973; Closing Date:
March 31, 1980
Overall, the project is about 85% completed. Two of the three
contract sections constituting the new Kuala Lumpur-Seremban Expressway have
been completed and the third section which is neariag completion has been
Dartially taken over.  Except for a two mile section at the northern end, the
Expressway was opened for traffic in October 1976.  The improvement works to
the existing Kuala Lumpur-Seremban Road are substaatially completed, while
the widening and improvement works of the Kuala Livmpur-;oatang Kali Road,
which were started in November 1976, will take still one and a half to two
years to complete.  ConsultnTg services for various studies and detailed
engineering have been completed. Construction costs bave escalated sharply
because of rapid inflation, and the total project cost is now estimated
to be US$46 million, compared to an. appraisal estimate of US$37 million.
Loan No. 1214  Second Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project; US$26.0 Million
Lean of March L1, 1976; Effective Date: November 11, 1976;
Closing Date:  Junle 30, 1981
The main objective of the project is to increase the efficiency
of the transport system in Kuala Lumpur. Public transport services will be
improved whil4e the use of private cars will be restrained. Although primarily
coracern'ed with urban transport, the project also introduces new approaches to
residential development for low-income families. The main components are:

progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them.  They should be read in this sense, and with the understaading that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

(a) road and intersection improvements, traffic engineering and control
schemes and new radial roads; (b) trasnport policy measures including intro-
duction of minibus services, traffic priorities for high-occupancy vehicles
and area road pricing; (c) new serviced plots for about 1,400 households and
150 businesses and improvement of infrastructure services for about 2,100
existing households; and (d) technical assistance to support traffic manage-
ment and transport planning, to prepare an urban development project for
Kuantan, and to review national housing policies and programs.. Progress on
the transport components has been quite satisfactory although delays have been
experienced. Execution of the residential components has beeln less satisfac-
tory due to administrative and policy problems.
Loan No. 1376 Third Highway Proiect; US$35.0 Million Loan of April 4, 1977;
Effective Date: May 4, 1977: Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The main objective of the project is to improve the highway network
in the East Malaysian State of Sabah through the reconstruction and upgrading
of priority links and the development of the Public Work Department's
maintenance capacity. A further objective is to protect road investments in
Peninsular Malaysia through a pilot road maintenance and pavement strengthen-
ing program in three states. The project also includes an urban study of Kota
Kinabalu in Sabah and a transport/railway study in Peninsular'Malaysia.
Construction work on the East and West Coast Roads in Sabah is under way, but
upgrading program in Sabah has not yet been started due to a delay of
about one year in appointing consultants to assist PWD. While satisfactory
progress has been made in the preparatory work for the construction in
Peninsular Malaysia, the reorganization of maintenance sections in the three
pilot states is behind schedule due to staff shortages.
Loan No. 1031 Sixth Power Prolect; US$45.0 Million Loan of July 25, 1974;
Effective Date: October 22, 1974; Closing Date: June 30,
1980
Loan No. 1178 Seventh Power Project; US$35.0 Million Loan of December 17,
1975; Effective Date: March 10, 1976; Closing Date:
June 30, 1981
Loan No. 1443 Eighth Power Project; US$22.0 Million Loan of August 3,
1977; Effective Date: January 9, 1978; Closing Date:
June 30, 1982
The 275 kV transmission lines from Temengor to Papan and from Port
Dickson to Malacca financed under the Sixth Power Project have been completed.
The Seventh Power Project (the Prai Power Station extension, 3 x 120 MW) and
the Eighth Power Project (the Pasir Cudan Power Station, 2 x 120 MW) are
still in the early stages of construction; progress is generally satis-
faktory.  Based on the Bank's recommendation, the Government has agreed to

apply fuel surcharges to commercial and industrial consumers since mid-1975
and to provide NEB with equity of about US$200 million during the period
FY77-81 on a year by year basis to bridge NEB's financial gap. Maximum
demand and energy sales for FY77 were 975-MW and 5,297 GWH respectively (16%
above FY76 levels).
Loan No. 908   Second Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Project; US$13.5 Million
Loan of June 14, 1973, Effective Date: August 27, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project consists of the expansion of water supply facilities
to meet increasing demands in Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley area. The
first part of the project, comprising ordinary water works, was completed
in 1976, practically on schedule and within the cost estimates, and is
operational. The construction of the Langat Dam, the last and major work of
the project, is progressing satisfactorily and is expected to be completed by
the end of 1979.  Completion will be two years behind schedule.  Cost of the
dam is likely to be about 25% more than originally estimated, resulting in
an increase in the total project cost of about 15%. No difficulties are
foreseen in raising the additional funds required. The Selangor State Water
Department, which is responsible for the project, performs well in spite of
staffing problems. Its financial management still needs some strengthening.
The closing date has been extended for two years to June 30, 1980.
Loar. 1213-MA   Kuala Lumpur Sewerae Project; US$21.5 Million Loan of
March 11, 1976; Effective Date:  August '5; 1976
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project is the first stage (1976-81) of a 30-year master plan
for the sewerage development in the Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan area. It
includes the extension of sewers (about 70 miles of trunk and lateral sewers)
and treatment facilities to serve an additional population of 200,000 in the
Kuala Lumpur Federal Territory; the institution of a separate Sewerage Depart-
ment within the Kuala Lumpur City Hall, with its own accounting system and
finances; engineering and management consultant services; staff training; and
the preparation of sewerage and pollution control measures for the Kuala
Lumpur metropolitan area. The engineering of the project has been satisfac-
torily completed. Bidding for two out of the three major contracts (sewers)
has also been completed. However, land acquisition and resettlement of
present occupants are creating serious problems which are delaying the project.
The establishment of a separate accounting system for the Sewerage Department
(Kuala Lumpur City Hall) is progressing well. Action to levy the sewerage
surcharge on water bills has bcen undertaken after long delays. Comoliance
with covenants regarding long-term sewc_rage and urban planning in Sel?rgor
State is lagging.

Loan No. 885   Third Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project;
US$25.0 Million Loan of March 30, 1973; Effective
Date: June 22, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
Planting operations have been completed but due to the severe
droughts in 1976 and 1977 a heavy supplying program especially on the rubber
schemes is being carried out, which is due to be completed by the end of
1978. About 23,500 acres of oil palm and 16,400 acres of rubber have been
planted. Planting and maintenance standards are satisfactory. Only scheme 15
is in production. So far, 1,467 houses have been constructed and 1,347
settlers have moved in. Schools and clinics are under construction but will
only be completed about one year after settler entry. Due to delays in
settler house construction, settler entry will be delayed by two to two and a
half years on various schemes. JKR capacity is a major constraint in speeding
up house construction. Coordination between JKR and FELDA has improved
considerablv and FELDA expects that the backlog will not increase. Oil palm
mill construction on scheme 18 is on schedule and will be completed by April
1979. Water to schemes 16 to 18 is temporarily supplied from Jengka II due
to delays in intake construction on scheme 19. Due to excessive transfers in
middle management field staff, there is lack of leadership which affects
continuity of work.
Loan No. 967   Johore Land Settlement Prolect; US$40.0 Million Loan of
February 27, 1974; Effective Date: May 16, 1974; Closing
Date: June 30, 1982
Clearing and planting proper are satisfactorily on schedule, except
for phase III of the Ulu Dengar scheme due to late logging. Planting and
maintenance standards are satisfactory. Oil palm production started on four
schemes in 1977. However, due to the severe droughts in 1976 and 1977, early
yields are disappointing. Attacks of elephants and wild boar resulted in a
loss of 25% of the total oil palm stand. FELDA has embarked on a massive
trenching program around the scheme boundaries and indications are that this
program may be effective. FELDA is now preparing for a gigantic supplying
program. So far, 828 houses have been constructed and 710 settlers have
moved in. Due to delays in settler house construction, delays of one to
three years in settler entry are to be expected on various schemes. Lack of
capacity in JKR and in the Ministries of Education and Health has delayed
construction of schools and clinics, but the situation is improving because
of the creation of separate units in these Ministries catering for FELDA
schemes. Two of the five oil mills to be constructed under the loan were
commissioned in 1977.
Loan No. 973   Western Johore Agricultural Development Project; US$45.0 Million
Loan of April 5, 1974; Effective Date:  August 14, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
Project civil works are still substantially behind schedule, and
acceleration of work has proven difficult due to unusually severe rainfall
and flooding, refinements in design requiring construction of numerous
small water control structures, and the persistent problems of land acqui-
sition in a settled smallholder area. However, work is progressing on all
drainage basin contracts, at costs considerably below appraisal estimates.
The project has recently been expanded to include the construction of



ANNEX II
Page 7 of 9
drainage works and agricultural installations in the Phase II area of
Western Johore and construction of a network of secondary roads in the
original Phase I area.
Loan No. 1044 Keratong Land Settlement Project; US$36.0 Million Loan of
October 3, 1974;--Effective Date: January 9, 1975; Closing
Date:  June 30, 1983
Clearing and planting operations on schemes 8 and 9 are delayed by
about 9 to 12 months due to late logging.  Scheme 2 is in production.
Production on scheme 3 has been postponed due to labor shortages. Schemes 4
and 5 are expected to come in production by late 1978, but this may also
have to be postponed. Despite the labor shortage, maintenance standards are
satisfactory. Attacks by elephants and wild boar resulted in a loss of 12%
of the total oil palm stand. FELDA will start a trenching program whereafter
a supplying program will be initiated. Following the decision to reduce the
holding size from 14 to 10 acres, settlers of schemes 1 through 5 will be
housed in Town 22, while separate townships will be constructed for schemes 6
through 9. So far, 411 houses have been completed and 283 settlers moved in.
The relationship between DARA and FELDA has improved considerably following
the changes in DARA top management, and FELDA expects that the backlog in
settler entry will not increase. Efforts will be made to clear this backlog.
Loan No. 1115 Agricultural Research and Extension Project; US$28.5 Million
Loan of May 30, 1975; Effective Date: October 21, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
Project implementation is now about two years behind the appraisal
estimates. A new Director General was appointed in mid-1977 and a new
Deputy Director for Administration was appointed in January 1978, but the
post of Deputy Director for Research is still vacant. Some progress has
been made on international recruitment of scientist and research program
reviewers. Six scientists are now on board and a total of 15 man-years has
been committed representing 15% of the total scheduled under the project.
An additional one man-year has been utilized for consultants to conduct nine
program reviews. Civil works and fellowships are the only components of the
project that have been proceeding at a satisfactory pace. The extension
component of the project is also about two years behind schedule and has had
similar management constraints with a change in Directors occurring in March
1978. The next six months should be adequate to indicate whether the new
management will be able to get the project moving.
Loan No. 1294 North Kelantan Rural Development Project; US$21.0 Million
Loan of July 21, 1976; Effective Date: October 28, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
While still behind the original schedule, the project is beginning
to show signs of movement. A large road contract, covering about two thirds
of the PWD road component, has been tendered, and the remaining PWD roads
should be tendered by the end of 1978. Work has started on DID main drain and
flood protection facilities and installation of GRP flume tertiary irrigation

canals. DID has resolved the major design problems involved in implementing
the Lemal irrigation component. The agricultural extension component is
progressing well in two complete Districts, and preparation is under way for
extension to two more, out of eight in Kelantan. The next task, integrating
credit and irrigation 0&M operations with extension, is beginning, albeit
slowly. The FOA construction program is progressing rapidly, and large-scale
procurement of agricultural equipment has begun. The Government has assigned
a large number of land officers to break the land acquisition bottleneck to
construction implementation. Staff appointments remain the major potential
constraint on implementation.
Loan No. 1444 National Small-Scale Irrigation Prolect; US$39.0 Million Loan
of Auaust 3. 1977: Effective Date: October 25, 1977;
Closins Date: March 31. 1983
Of the 195 proposed small irrigation schemes to be implemented under
the project, 10 are currently under construction, 19 have been approved by
the Bank for inclusion in the project following appraisal by the Preparation
and Evaluation Team established under the project, 15 additional schemes are
currently being appraised by that team, and topographic, hydrological and
soils surveys are under way in 60 other scheme areas, including three each in
Sabah and Sarawak. State-level Preparation and Evaluation Teams have been
established in the latter two states. The Rompin/Endau Irrigation Development
Study, also being financed by the loan, is now under way.
Loan No. 1522 Northwest Selangor Integrated Agricultural Development Project;
US$26.0 Million Loan of February 23, 1978: Effective Date:
June 21, 1978: Closing Date: December 31, 1983
The project is providing improved drainage and irrigation facili-
ties, access roads, training and intensified agricultural supporting ser-
vices; it is also improving the regional drainage systems.
Loan No. 810   Second Education Project; US$15.5 Million Loan of April 5,
1972; Effective Date: July 7. 1972; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978
The project is financing the establishment of a curriculum develop-
ment center, science schools for the University of Penang, vocational schools,
and an educational television system. With the exception of parts of the
University and one vocational school, project institutions are practically
completed and operating.  Earlier delays incurred in the implementation of
these two items necessitated a postponement of the closing date by one year.
The delays are reflected in slow disbursements, but the problem is currently
being addressed by the Bank and the Government. Project cost overruns (20%)
are expected to be financed by the Government.

Loan No. 974   Third Education Project; US$19.0 Million Loan of April 5,
1974; Effective Date: June 26, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
The project assists the Government to develop technical training,
pre-service teacher training, and an East Malaysia educational television
system. Implementation has improved since a year ago when less than 50% of
project civil works had been tendered. Contracts have now been awarded for 11
out of 13 project institutions. Construction began in early 1976 and most of
the project institutes are scheduled for completion in late 1978. The Project
Unit is functioning satisfactorily, despite current problems with bid evaluation.
Loan No. 1329 Fourth Education Project; US$35.0 Million Loan of
November 18, 1976; Effective Date: January 14, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The project is designed to improve the quality of primary schooling
and to redress existing imbalances in the provision of primary education
by providing additional classrooms in poverty areas, facilities for teacher
training and one teacher training college in Sarawak. The project includes
three new Industrial Training Centers and expansion of two existing ones. It
includes also a study on community education in preparation of government
investment in nonformal education. Project implementation appears to be
satisfactory. Problems in the processing of disbursements have been
resolved. Shortage of staff in the Project Unit has been remedied by the
Government. Disbursements began a half year behind schedule during the
second half of FY78.
Loan No. 880   Population Project; US$5.0 Million Loan of February 9,
1973; Effective Date: June 21, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981
The National Family Planning Board (NFPB), by activating the
national and state level committees and subcommittees, has recently gained
greater managerial control over the project implementation; however, it has
yet to accelerate the slow progress of civil works. To date, about 270
buildings out of a total of 571 have been completed and a further 115 are
under construction. According to the revised schedule, there will still be
facilities whose construction will be completed only by mid-1981.  Disbursements
increased from 5% of the loan amount in September 1976, to 30% in July 1978.
Annual contraceptive acceptors rose from about 75,000 to 1976 to over 80,000
in 1977; more than 35,000 of these acceptors were reported to have been
recruited through the integrated rural health facilities supported by
the project. The percentage of women in childbearing age currently using
contraception increased from 16 in 1970 to over 35 by 1975. The birth rate
of 31 per thousand in 1973 declined to 30.2 in 1976.
