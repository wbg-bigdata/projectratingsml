INTERNATIONAL DEVELOMNT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMPNDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
XE;CUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPIT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A FOURTH AGRICULTURAL
ESTATES PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of US$11.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a fourth agricultural estates
project.
PART I - THE ECONONY
2.        The most recent Bank economic report on Indonesia (EAP-27a) is
dated November 30, 1971.   A summary of its main conclusions, appropriately
updated, was included in my Report No. P-1074 dated May 17, 1972 (Development
Finance Company Project).   For easy reference a revised and shortened version
of the economic section of that report is reproduced in Annex II, following
the Country Data.   An economic mission is currently in Indonesia and its
report will concentrate on development issues and prospects, particularly as
related to the preparation of the Second Five Year Flan (1974-79).
PART II - BANK GaRoP STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS
3.        Indonesia's continuing economic development will require, in addition
to substantial external support, some change in emphasis from rehabilitation
and improvement in infrastructure to the expansion of capabilities for sustained
additional production in agriculture, minerals, forestry and manufacturing.
It will also require continued strengthening of the institutions for the
planning of development and management of the economy.   Key problems of wel-
fare and income distribution, including family planning as well as regional
development and related patterns of employment and population movement, will
be important in Indonesia's development strategy.
4.        The economic work and the lending operations of the Bank Group,
including the work of the Resident Staff in Indonesia, have been oriented
toward these objectives.   The focus of the Bank's economic work is upon providing
assistance to the Government in the current preparation of Indonesia's next
Five Year Plan (1974-79).
5.        Bank Group financing is shifting its emphasis from infrastructure
to direct production in agriculture and industry.    The latter would include
industrial estates and industrial finance.   Transport, power and other infra-
structure will, of course, continue to be part of the financing program as
will operations in education and family planning.    Project poseibilities are
also likely in water supply, urban development and tourism.



-2-
6.        Consistent with Indonesia's large external resource requirements,
and difficult balance of payments problems, the Bank Group's assistance to
Indonesia (aside from IFC investments) has been and will continue to be in
the form of IDA credits.   In recognition of the urgent need for institutional
reforms, most IDA projects will continue to include major steps to reorganize
existing institutions or to establish new ones, involving the creation of new
project authorities, the drafting of charters and the enactment of legislation.
At the same time, to supplement the Government's efforts in improving
administration and management, credits, as in the past, will include provision
for consultants'services and other technical assistance.
7.        Priority projects commonly involve a high. proportion of local
expenditure, and it is not practicable to meet Indonesia's need for external
capital if external lenders lend- only for the import component of projects.
The Association has therefore covered some local expenditure in its financing
and will have to continue to do;,so in cases where the foreign exchange com-
ponent of project expenditures is low.
8.        Indonesia has received twenty-one IDA credits amounting to US$273.4
million.   Annex I contains a-summary statement of IDA credits and IFC invest-
ments as of HMY 31, 1972, and notes on the execution of on-going projects with
particular reference to those which are encountering problems in execution and
giving rise to delays in disbursement.   The composition of this lending reflects
the priorities for rehabilitation and development established by the Government.
Indonesia's First Five-Year Plan. (1969-74) gives highest priority to agriculture.
The Association has already extended three credits to help rehabilitate and
develop plantations in the Government estates sector.   Other credits for agri-
culture include four to assist rehabilitation of irrigation systems, one for
fisheries and one to help increase rice yields throughout Indonesia by estab-
lishing a seed multiplication. program for high-yielding rice varieties.   The
Association also organized a consortium of lenders to finance a major expansion
of the RPSRI fertilizer plant.   These ten credits account for more than half
of the Association's lending to Indonesia.
9.        In order to accelerate rehabilitation in other sectors, credits have
also been extended for highways,. power, telecommunications, industrial financing,
education and population.   In addition, three technical assistance credits
have been made to help finance. pre-investment studies undertaken by the Govern-
ment, which have helped to establish investment priorities over a wide range
of activities.
10.       The first IDA credit, to Indonesia was made in September 1968.
Thirteen of the twenty-one credits have. been made since July 1, 1970.  The
program is thus relatively new, and largely for this reason the undisbarsed
portion of the credits is large.. Another contributing factor is that virtually



every credit has introduced extensive institutional reform, involving the
creation of new project authorities, drafting of new charters, and enactment
of new legislation, all of which have taken much time.   Several credits -
inciuding the first two for agricultural estates projects - have experienced
pronounced delays in disbursement because of management problems (Annex I).
U1.,      Two other credits are being presented to the Executive Directors
in the current fiscal year:  a second power distribution project and an
inter-island fleet rehabilitation project.   In addition, two other projects
in hitherto unassisted fields - livestock and smallholder rubber and oil palm -
have been appraised and credit negotiations will be scheduled shortly.
PART III - ESTATE AGRICULTURE
12.i      Production from both Government-owned and private estates has
contributed 15-20 percent of export earnings in recent years compared with
about 60 percent before World War II.   The decline reflects the difficulties
which have faced the estate sector: war-time occupation, followed by a war
for-independence, internal conflicts, nationalization - temporary or per-
manent - of all foreign-owned enterprises, shortage of funds for replanting,
processing facilities, and agricultural machinery, and mismanagement, all
contributed to the decline.
13.       In 1971, Government-owned estates comprised a planted area of some
609,000 ha on which the two major crops were rubber (225,000 ha) and oil palm
(90,000 ha).   The estates were previously organized in five major crop groups,
each centrally managed from Djakarta.   In 1968 they were reorganized into 28
estate groups known as PNPs and based on geographic location, crop and size.
Each PNP has an Executive Board of Directors, sometimes located on one of the
estates and sometimes at a regional center such as Medan in North Sumatra or
Bandung in West Java.   These Boards are responsible for day-to-day management
andinormally consist of a President Director, a Production Director and a
Commercial Director.   Many important powers, however, are reserved for the
Minister of Agriculture, including senior staff appointments, approval of
budgets and financial statements, and determination of major policy matters.
IhelMinister normally exercises these powers through the Directorate Ceneral
of Estates within the Ministry.
14.E     In recognition of the potential contribution that healthy estate
agriculture can make to Indonesia's development, the Government in the last five
years has devoted increasing resources and attention to the rehabilitation of
this sector.   The Association has been very much involved in this process.
To help quantify the rehabilitation needs and to draw up appropriate invest-
ment programs, the first IDA credit for estate rehabilitation (Cr. 155-IND)
provided funds for a survey of Government-owned estates.   The two subsequent
estate projects as well as the proposed project were identified and prepared
by consultants engaged for that survey.   Assistance to the estates sector is
also being provided by the Asian Development Bank and by the Netherlands.



-4-
15.       The increased availability of resources is gradually helping to
overcome the physical deterioration caused by years of'neglect.   Improving
the management of Government estates, however, has,proven much harder to
achieve.   It has been very difficult to strike a proper balance between
the need for centralized control and monitoring and the desirable degree
of autonomy of the PNPs.   To achieve effective and efficient day-to-day
management of individual PNPs has been equally difficult.   The two problems
are closely related.
16.       When the first two,,estates projects (Crs. 155 and 194-IND) were
appraised it wa,s expected that the managements of the PNPs involved could
implement the proposed rehabilitation programs with the assistance of con-
sultants in an a,dvisory capacity.  The Government and the Association agreed
that it would be,desirable,'to moye in,the direction of increased,autonomy
by giving PNP managements greater control over their affairs and by trans-
ferring some ofg 1tMe direct control exercised by the Minister of Agriculture
through the Dirzeorate General of Estates to. supervisory boards.   Moving
further in the same direction, the PNPs. participating in the third project
(Cr. 259-IND) have been converted into,state-owned corporate-bodies operating
independently under the'commercial code (PTs).
17.       Exper*,ence under-the first two projects,, however,. has highlighted
a serious shortage-of managerial skills at theNP NP level and the- need for
more effective centralized control.   To improve. and, rationalize the control
of FNPs, the Government, with,the assistance.of the Association, is sponsoring
a survey from which will'come.proposals f,or,the prop erorganizational structure
for the sector.and the extent and form of centralized monitoring and control.
While the conversion.from PNP to- PT appears to be working,in the case of the
third estates project, it would not,be,. prudent to1 pr,oceed.-with,the conversion
of all FNPs to PTs before the above survey is completed.   The specific
arrangements to ensure effective day,-to,-day,management in this project are
described in paragraphs.27-29.
PART IV - THE PROJECT,
18.       Background:   The proposed,project would, over a twelve-year period
(1972-84), rehabilitate and,develop,PNP X - a,,group of.:fourteen scattered
Government-owned estates in the, Lampung and,South Sumatra provinces of Sumatra
(see map).   Of. the fourteen estates, eight are. within' 50 km of headquarters
at Ketadon and the remainder range from 70 km,to 850 lan by road from head-
quarters.   The total land area of PNP X estates.is about 36,900 ha.   Since
nationalization in 1957 agricultural conditions.and infrastructure have
deteriorated steadily with. the,.result that by. the end of 1972 the cultivated
area will have been reduced to about 8,040 ha. Thisp,would consist of 5,300
ha of rubber, 2,000 ha of oil palm and 740 ha of 'tea. -PNP,X also owns,
eleven small ribbed smoked sheet rubber factories, a.central block rubber
factory in the,southern estates, additional,crepe.,processing facilities in



the northern estates, and a palm oil factory on Bekri - the only oil palm
estate.   All are in poor condition and inefficient.   Transportation of
crops and headquarters supervision are hampered by the poor condition of the
earth roads within estates and of the gravel roads connecting estates to
main arteries.   Housing, provided for about 25 percent of PNP X's work force,
is also inadequate.
19.       As noted in paragraph 14J, this project was prepared by consultants
financed under the first estate credit.   It was appraised in December 1971
and negotiations were held in Washington during May 22-26, 1972. The leader
of the Gbvernment's delegation was General Mhluk Iubis, the Director General
of Estates.   The appraisal report is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors (PA-138).
20.       The ProJect:   The proposed project would restore some 4,000 ha
previously planted with rubber; increase the area under oil palm by 7,400
hi;  rehabilitate and raise the productivity of about 4,600 ha existing rubber
and about 2,000 ha of existing oil palm;  develop pilot programs for cloves,
cinnamon, coconuts and cocoa; prepare a program for the rehabilitation and
development of the one tea estate included in the project; improve and expand
processing facilities for both rubber and palm oil; rehabilitate and expand
the palm oil storage and pumping facilities of PNP X at the port of Pandjang;
improve the condition of estate roads and gravel link roads; and upgrade
existing housing and provide new housing for the workers who will have to
be recruited for the project from Java.   The programs for new plantings of
rubber and oil palm and for the rehabilitation of existing plantings would
be supplemented by programs of fertilization based on foliar and soil analysis
and by improved agricultural practices including weed and disease control and
drainage.   The project would also strengthen the management of PNP X and
provide consulting services for estate inspection, engineering, foliar and
soidl analysis, plant breeding and marketing, and' for pilot diversification
schemes for tea, cloves, cinnamon, coconuts and cocoa.
21.       Cost and Financing:   The project will be physically completed by
1984 at an estimated cost of US$25.6 million.   The expenditures on the project
fdr the first eight years, that is through the end of 1980, amounting to
US$21.9 million (see Annex III), will have to be financed entirely by outside
fuinds since PNP X's projected financial position over that period shows no
cash surplus available for investment after meeting debt service on existing
borrowings.   This US$21.9 million would be provided as to US$1l million from
the proceeds of the proposed IDA credit and US$10.9 million by the Government
of Indonesia.   The remaining expenditures on the program after 1980 can be
financed by PNP X itself out of its increasing cash flow, provided debt service
on the funds drawn down from 1972 to 1980 is deferred.   Accordingly, the
GOvernment has agreed to provide the US$21.9 million as a loan with a grace



-6-
period of ten years on repayments of prinoipal and a waiver of 18 years
on payment of interest.   Repayment of the loan, including interest after
the grace period at 12 percent per annum, is expected to be completed by
the end of the thirtieth year. Further details of loan terms are in Annex III.
22.       Procurement:   The goods and services (other than the services
of consultants)`required for the project and to be financed out of the
proceeds of the credit, would be procured on the basis of international
competition under procedures consistent with the Guidelines for Procurement
under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits.  For purposes of bid comparison,
local producers who add substantial value during manufacture would be
accorded a margin of preference of 15 percent or the actual customs duty,
whichever is less.
23.        Lsbi.rsement:  The equivalent of US$10 million of the proposed
credit would -7-disbursed against direct and estimated indirect foreign
exchange costp Qfs fertilizers, chemicals, agricultural machinery, vehicles,
contracts for .construction and installation of palm oil and rubber factories
and the services of experts, consultants and inspect6rs.  A maximum of $1
million would be reserved for disbursements to be made against the progress
of plantings; because planting is labor intensive, these expenditures would
be primarily local currency costs.   Th ensure that plantings are properly
established, disbursement would be made 1?-18 months after planting and the
amount per hectare. disbursed would be determined in accordance with inspec-
tors' assessment of planting standards.   By linking some part of disburse-
ments to planting standards it is hoped to create incentives for improved
performance.   It would also enhance the influence of. inspectors whose
recommendations have not always been followed in previous agricultural
estates projects.
24.       Retroactive. Financing:  Project costs include an estimated expendi-
ture of US$360,000 equivalent in 1972 for goods (including chemicals and palm
oil processing machinery), which are essential for PNP X's rehabilitation
program; delay in their procurement would impede project implementation.
The foreign exchange cost of these expenditures would be financed retroactively
from the proposed credit up to an amount of US$200,000, provided the goods are
procured in accordance with the Association's guidelines.
25.       Economic Justification:  At full development, by 1985-90, the
annual production of palm oil, palm kernels and rubber on PNP X estates would
be increased by 38,500 tons,. 7,200 tons and 10,500 tons respectively. Annual
foreign exchange earnings from all crops would increase from their present
level of US$2 million to about US$10 million.  The economic rate of return
for the project as a whole is estimated to be about 19 percent.  Of the
different parts of the project the rehabilitation of existing rubber yields
the highest economic return (34 percent) because. of the large amount of
investment which has already occurred.  The, rates of return for new rubber
plantings and oil palm are 18 percent and 13 percent respectively0



-7-
26.       The project would provide additional employment for some 2,500
people from crowded Java and this is consistent with the resettlement policies
of the Government.   By virtue of the various pilot schemes included in it,
the project would also establish a sound basis for the future diversification
of PNP X thereby in the long run reducing the risks inherent in its dependence
on the movement of world prices for two major commodities.
27.       Management Arrangements:   As noted in paragraphs 15-17 and in
Annex I, the previous projects have served to highlight serious management
problems both in the centralized monitoring and control of PNPs and in their
day-to-day management.   The management survey of the Government estate
sector, which is being financed under Credit 216-IND (Second Technical
Assistance project) represents an important step towards the solution of the
question of centralized control of estates by the Gbvernment.    Pending the
findings and recommendations of this survey in early 1973 no supervisory
board would be established for PNP X and the project would continue under
the direct control of the Directorate General of Estates.   As a temporary
form of supervision this arrangement is satisfactory.    The Government has
agreed that as soon as the survey is completed it would consult with the
Association on which of the survey's recommendations are to be implemented
and those recommendations which are applicable to PNP X would be implemented
as soon as possible.
28.       In the first two projects, attempts to improve day-to-day manage-
ment by the appointment of advisors without executive functions have produced
disappointing results.   Consequently in this project three internationally
recruited experts would be given full executive responsibilities.    They would
be placed in charge of rubber, oil palm and commercial operations respectively
for an initial period of three years which can be extended if necessary, and
they would be directly responsible to the President Director of PNP X. The
experts would have assistants who would be trained to assume these responsi-
bilities at the end of the experts' stay.   Project management would be further
strengthened by the appointment of a qualified firm to provide inspection
services as in the previous projects.   In addition, the accounts of PNP would
be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Association.
29.       Experience with the first two agricultural estates projects suggests
that management arrangements, however good they may look on paper, may not
work as smoothly as anticipated.   Nevertheless, the Government and the
Association are in agreement that the arrangements proposed for this project
are the best that can be devised at this time.   The risk that they may not
work out well and will need revision is a risk that must be faced in view of
the importance of establishing a viable basis for the rehabilitation of the
agricultural estates sector in Indonesia.
30.       Effectiveness:   The appointments of the three internationally
recruited experts, inspectors and auditors would be conditions of effective-
ness of the credit.   The execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between
the Government and PNP X embodying the onlending arrangements described in
paragraph 21 and in Annex III would also be a condition of effectiveness.



PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
31.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Indonesia and the Association, the recommendation of the Committee referred
to in Article V Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association,
and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.   The draft Development
Credit Agreement is in the usual form for this type of project and follows
closely the text of the Development Credit Agreements for the preceding
agricultural estates projects.
32.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
33.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

III. Credits Experiencing Dalays in nisbursement
Previous Avrcu1tu      slata Pro ieetat Credits 155 and 194-IND
(first and second agricultural estates projects) became effective six and
eight months respectively after signature. Delays in effectiveness and in
appointing management advisors and visiting inspectors, have resulted in
the projects being approximately one year behind the schedules estimated
in the appraisal reports. Other than these delays, the project development
programs have been followed except for oil palm planting and replanting
which have been restricted by an unforeseen lack of suitable planting
material. An oil palm consultant determined that much of the oil palm
planting material produced in Indonesia was genetically unsuitable; this
resulted in the need to destroy many nurseries. The breeding program is
now proceeding satisfactorily and, with the addition of imported seed,
1972 plantings will proceed as planned.
While there have been improvements, inexperienced management is
the principal problem. At appraisal it was believed that, with the help
of experienced foreign advisors, management would improve steadily. In
practice, the improvement has been much slower than anticipated, and the
impact of the advisors has been very mixed. Principal management problems
are lax financial and operational controls, poor communications, lack of
delegation and insufficient knowledge of modern plantation techniques.
In order to achieve the improvements in management that have
occurred, to ensure that planting and rehabilitation programs proceed and
to ensure that procurement is in accordance with the Ouidelines, it has
been necessary to schedule three to four supervision visits annually.
Moreover, one of the Agricultural Advisors of the Resident Staff is engaged
almost full-time in assisting the Government and the PNPs involved in
implementation of these projects.
The Government has recently taken two actions to improve the
situation. First, on the basis of an aide-memoire prepared by the Association,
it agreed in November 1971 to the implementation of specific improvements in
accordance with a timetable. Project PNPs have been instructed to execute the
action program by July 1972; a supervision mission in March 1972 reported
some improvement and a further review is scheduled for August 1972. Second,
it has commissioned a study by management consultants to devise a system
whereby it will be able to effectively supervise and control the PNPs. While
it is too early to determine whether these actions will have the desired
results, the Government's determination augurs well for the future. The third
agricultural estates project (Cr. 259-IND) became effective in December 1971.
Progress to date is satisfactory and the relationship between management and
the consultants appears good.

Other Credits:   There were initial delays in procurement on the
telecommunications project (Cr. 210-IND), but all major contracts have now
been awarded except for the tropospheric scatter system for which the
consultants have just completed the survey and prepared specifications.
Disbursements on two projects, electricity distribution (Cr. 165-IND) and
education I (Cr. 219-IND)), have been delayed because of problems in the
selection and appointment of consultants by the Government0   For the
electricity project, however, consultants have been appointed and orders
are now being placed for equipment; disbursements are expected to rise
satisfactorily.   As to the education project, negotiations with consultants
were protracted partly because of uncertainties regarding the liability of
foreign consultants and contractors to Indonesian income tax, but the
contract is now signed.
Wbrk on the first irrigation rehabilitation project (Cr. 127-IND)
is proceeding well, and disbursements are on schedule.   The second such
project (Cr. 195-IND) was delayed by three months due to difficulties in
establishing the new project authority, and further delays occurred because
of procurement difficulties, but construction contracts are now being
awarded and disbursements are expected soon to rise sharply.   On the third
proJect (Cr. 220-IND), planning and design are progressing, but there are
possibilities of cost overruns and delays, which are currently under review;
meanwhile, construction is under way.   Design and construction of the
fisheries project (Cr. 211-IND) have been delayed by about one year, pending
completion of a master plan to develop the project site, and disbursements
have been accordingly set back; the master plan is now ready and prospects
for successful project implementation now look good.   In the case of the
FUSRI fertilizer expansion project (Cr. 193-DID), though disbursements
will not rise appreciably until the second half of 1972 when financing of
equipment contracts will commence, the project is proceeding well and the
borrower's performance on this complex project can be considered satisfactory.

ANNEX II
Page 4 of 5
THE FOLLOWING IS A REVISED AND SHORTENED VERSION OF PART II
OF THE REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT FOR A
DEVELOPMENT FINANCE COMPANY PROJECT (REPORT No. P-1074)
Indonesia's economic progress continues to be satisfactory.
The economy appears to be growing at around 6-7 percent, while price
stability is being maintained and exports are increasing. Production
of rioe, the basio commodity, has increased substantially for the
fourth successive year. In the industrial sector, espeoially in tex-
tiles, there is further substantial growth.   With private foreign
investment aocelerating and the rehabilitation and expansion of domestic
enterprises being fostered under official programs, the prospects of
industrial growth frcm the present small base are good.
Economic progress is at an early stage, however, and the
problems which remain to be tackled are large.   The population
project (Credit 260-IND)    represents a first step in dealing with
high birth rates in densely populated areas and marks an important
reversal of earlier attitudes. Advances have been made in formulating
plans, programs and projects and in starting to implement them, but the
limited managerial and financial resources still present a serious
obstacle.   The pressure on financial resources is evidenced by
continuing high rates of interest and by the necessity for a devaluation
in August 1971, designed in part as a precaution in the face of interna-
tional uncertainties and in part to restrain import demand following a
loss of foreign exchange reserves. In 1972 there are prospects of a
significant increase in both foreign exchange earnings and Government
revenues, as a result principally of sharp increases in oil production
and in the volume and value of oil exports.   The demand for resources
is so great, however, that the need for aid will continue at a high
level, even after allowance for increased earnings from oil, as a
supplement to dcmestic resouroes available for public and private invest-
ment and improvement of essential services.
Bank Group assistance to Indonesia is a part of the interna-
tional support being given in increasing amounts through the Inter-
Governmental Group for Indonesia (IGGI).   Aid commitments have risen
from $200 million in 1967 to well over $600 million for 1971/72.   The
proportion of project aid has steadily increased over this period, but
substantial program aid remains essential as support for the balance of
payments and - in spite of strong domestic revenue efforts - as a
source of additional funds for the development budget.   For 1972/73
the Government requested IGGI aid of $670 million, of which $350 million is
for project aid and $320 million for program aid, including $110 million
in food supplies.   At its meeting in Amsterdam in December 1971, the
IGGI accepted this request, endorsed by the Bank and Fund, as appropriate



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 5
in relation to Indonesia's requirements; at the subsequent pledging
session on April 25-26, express or implied commitments by IGGI members
in fact amounted to some $724 million, approximately meeting the
request for food and non-food program aid and substantially exceeding
the amount sought in project aid.   In addition, it was announced at
the meeting that Japan would be providing outside the IGGI framework
a further $200 million of untied aid on conoessimnal terms for the
development of the oil sector.   The specific projects for which this
amount would be used have not yet been determined.
The rescheduling arrangements for pre-1966 external debt
which culminated in April 1970 in an agreement on a long-term settle-
ment of the debts held by 'Western creditors and Japan, and a subsequent
agreement on similar lines with several Eastern European countries,
resulted in a low ratio of external debt service to exports of about 11
percent of exports. It will rise appreciably throughout the 1970's
as grace periods expire on aid received after 1966, but should remain
manageable during the decade if exports increase, if restraints on
medium-term borrowing are maintained and if'new aid remains available
on concessional terms similar to those at present obtained'from the
MDGI.   All aid from the IGGI members has been given on concessional
terms approximating the standards set by the Development Assistance
Committee (DAC) of the OECD.

INDONESIA - FOURTH AGRICULTURAL ESTATES PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:            Republic of Indonesia
Beneficiary:         Perusahaan Negara Perkebunan (PNP X)
A group of fourteen Government-owned estates
in the Lampung and South Sumatra provinces of
Sumatra
Amount:              US$11 million equivalent in various currencies
Terms:               Standard
Relending Terms:     The full $21.9 million required during the first
eight years of the project (consisting of IDA
credit proceeds of $11 million and a rupiah loan
of $10.9 million equivalent) would ba passed on
to PNP X as a loan from the Government. Until
1990 interest would be waived and would not be
capitalized. Between 1983 (the first year in
which PNP X is expected to have a cash surplus)
and 1990 any surplus funds would be utilized
to repay the outstanding principal. By 1990
it is estimated that about $12,6 million of the
$21.9 million would have been repaid. From then
on PNP X would be able to repay the remaining
$9.3 million over an estimated 12-year period
at an interest rate not to exceed 12 percent per
annum (the rate currently applicable to Government
loans to commercial enterprises). In addition,
PNP X would be charged the equivalent of service
charges on the IDA credit from the commencement
of the project until 1990. However, payments
during the first ten years would be accumulated
and paid in full in 1983.
Project              The project is designed to assist PNP X in:   (i)
Descriptions        financing its rubber and palm oil rehabilitation
and replanting investments; (ii) improving and
expanding its existing rubber processing and palm
oil processing facilities; (iii) rehabilitating
and constructing housing; (iv) improving roads,

bridges and other estate infrastructure; (v)
putting into service new agricultural field
machinery, equipment and vehicles8and rehabi-
litating the existing ones; (vi).establishing
pilot programs for cloves, cinnamon, coconut
and cocoa, and a development program for the one
tea estate; (vii) achieving improvements in
PNP X's managerial and operational systems;
(viii) implementing foliar and soil
analyses.

Financing Plan:      The proposed IDA credit of US$11 million would
cover the foreign exchange component which is
approximately 50 percent of total project cost
during the first eight years; the remaining
US$10.9 would be provided by Government. By
1981 PNP X would be generating sufficient funds
to complete the project and would provide the
$3.7 million required for this purpose.

Arrangements:      the goods and services (other than the services
of consultants)required for the project and to
be financed out of the proceeds of the credit,
would be procured on the basis of international
competition under procedures consistent with the
Guidelines for Procurement under World Bank
Loans and IDA Credits. For purposes of bid
comparison, local producers who add substantial
value during manufacture would be accorded a
margin of preference of 15 percent or the actual
customs duty, whichever is less.
Consultants:        In order to strengthen the management and operation
of PNP X the following experts and specialists
would be employed by PNP X:
(i) three internationally recruited experts who
would be placed in charge of PNP X's rubber,
palm oil and commercial operatians
respectively;
(ii) as in previous agricultural estates projects,
qualified and experienced inspectors to
provide inspection and engineering advisory
services;
(iii). independent auditors;
(iv) technical assistance for crop diversification
schemes in cloves, cinnamon, coconuts and
cocoa and for the preparation of a development
program for the one tea estate of PNP X;
(v) specialists in foliar and soil analysis and
plant-breeding;
(vi) marketing advisory services,

Rate of              Economic returns are estimated to be 1h percent
Return:             for oil palm development, 29 percen,t for rubber,
with a combined weighted average ,of 19 percent.
Separate economic rates of return have been
calculated for rubber replanting and rehabili-
tation of existing rubber, The r.ates of return
are 18 percent and 35 percent respectively, The
rate of return is highest on the rehabilitation
of existing rubber plantation because of the
substantial investments which have been made in
the past.
