PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDONESIA : THE FOURTH AGRICULTURAL ESTATE PROJECT
(Credit 319-IND)
PREFACE
This is a project completion report of the Fourth Agricultural
Estate Project, for which Credit 319-IND was approved in June 1972 in the
sum of US$11.0 million and closed, fully disbursed, in June 1981.
The project completion report was prepared by the East Asia and
Pacific Regional Office on the basis of a country visit in December 1981.
This report is based on information from Bank Group files in Washington and
Jakarta, a consultant survey of PNP X of October 1971, Appraisal Report
No. PA-138 and the President's Report (No. 1099) of June 9, 1972, the project
completion report of September 1981 prepared by the executing agency,
discussions with SBPN, the Borrower's implementing agencies, estate officials
and management.
A copy of the PCR was sent to the Borrower on July 13, 1982 for
comments but none were received.
In addition to summarizing the objectives and results of the project,
the PCR expands upon specific relevant issues such as the project's impact on
management, institutional structure, the project's technological impact and
lessons for future development because of their relevance to this as well as
to other tree crop development projects.

THE FOURTH AGRICULTURAL ESTATE PROJECT (CREDIT 319-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
The project, one of a series aimed at improving the agricultural
and financial performance of the government-owned plantations (PNPs), was
designed to rehabilitate rubber and oil palm estates in the PNP X area in
South Sumatra.
The project as appraised was to: rehabilitate 2,000 ha of oil
palm and 9,700 ha of rubber; plant 7,400 ha of additional oil palm and
4,000 ha of rubber; rehabilitate existing factories and install new processing
capacity; and provide the estate with buildings, vehicles and technical
assistance. An important project feature was the appointment in PNP X of a
three-man expatriate team with executive responsibilities and the introduction
of expatriate team with executive responsibilities and the introduction of
expatriate inspection services to strengthen the management and improve the
operations of PNP X. As a consequence of joint effort between advisers and
management, productivity of the plantations improved and, in the early
years particularly, yields substantially exceeded the appraisal forecasts.
Palm oil production, despite a reduction in the planting program, was
almost 21,000 tons in 1981, against an appraisal estimate of 23,000 tons,
while rubber production was over 15,000 tons, as compared with an appraisal
forecast of 13,000 tons. Factory development was delayed by uncertainty as
to the capacity required and the best location for both the palm oil and
rubber plants due to an increase in the rubber planting program from 4,000 ha
to 64,00 ha, and a reduction in the oil palm program from 7,400 ha to
4,500 ha.
Financial results have largely exceeded expectations. An overall
cost increase of $14.2 million, was more than offset by higher prices and
increased production. Net income (1981 prices) from rubber rose from a loss
of Rp 333 million in 1971 to an estimated Rp 3,023 million in 1982, and net
income from palm oil increased from a loss of Rp 51 million in 1971 to
Rp 1,851 million in 1982.  local contractors in collaboration with foreign
contractors successfully carried out construction of the rubber plants,
labor housing and estate civil works.
On the technical side, inadequacies in project preparation and
appraisal resulted in conflicting views as to the best use of the available
land and necessitated substantial changes in project design during imple-
mentation.



v 
The project brought about organizational, technical and financial
benefits that accrued to the sector. The ERR for rubber is 38% (SAR 28%)
and for oil palm 20% (SAR 13%) or 30% overall, 11% higher than at appraisal.
Project objectives were campatible with Borrower's economic
policy, and legal covenants were relevant to ensuring effective implementa-
tion.
The following points may be of particular interest:
-  the project contributed to increased Indonesian rubber and palm
oil production, and by strengthening PNP X it led the way to
the inclusion of smallholder components in Bank-financed
projects for this and other government-owned estates (para. 7).
To date, six nucleus estates (NES) projects have been appraised
assisting about 57,000 families in cultivation of about
66,000 ha of rubber, 27,000 ha of oil palm and 10,000 ha of
coconut;
- the project contributed to a market improvement in rubber
quality; the establishment in the executing agency of a sound
organizational based accompanied by improved confidence and
capability of staff at all levels; the transformation of the
estate from one of the generally poorest of the 28 Government
tree crop estates to one of the most successful (paras. 12, 23);
and
- the following three major lessons were learned which may be
important in designing future projects (para. 32):
(a) establishment of good management is a difficult but not
impossible task and should always be considered as a
priority;
(b) consultants should be selected carefully, appointed
early and their performance monitored by a central
Government body; possibly Team Khusus (DGE); and
(c) sound and timely reporting procedures facilitate the
indentification and solution of problems.

THE FOURTH AGRICULTURAL ESTATE PROJECT (CREDIT 319-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Summary
The Fourth Agricultural Estate Project approved by IDA in 1972 was
designed to: rehabilitate rubber and palm oil in the the PTP X estates area
in South Sumatra, provide new processing facilities and strengthen estates
management. The project-s objectives were achieved. Standards achieved in
the planting and maintenance of rubber and oil palm were better than SAR's
p            estimates.  A 20-ton FFB/hr palm oil processing plant (Bekri Phase I) was
commissioned in February 1979 and another 20-ton FFB/hr plant (Bekri Phase
II) in July 1981. For rubber, a 20-ton/day crumb rubber factory was commis-
sioned in January 1982. Total project costs were US$36.3 million compared
to the SAR's estimate of US$21.9 million. PTP X is now based on a sound
organizational basis and has achieved satisfactory management performance.
Financial results have largely exceeded expectations. Net income (1981
prices) from rubber rose from a loss of Rp 333 million in 1971 to Rp 3,023
million in 1981, and net income from palm oil increased from a loss of Rp 51
million in 1971 to a profit of Rp 1,851 million in 1981. Due to its satis-
factory profitability, cost overruns were entirely borne by PTP X. Procure-
ment operations slow at the outset, improved substantially during project
implementation due to the increased assistance of RSI to Government.
Accounts were well kept and audited on time. Progress reports were produced
regularly. The ERR for rubber is 38% (SAR 28%) and for oil palm 20% (SAR
13%). The overall ERR is 30%, 11% higher than estimated at appraisal. The
principal weaknesses were: initial difficulties with procurement, and with
establishing effective communication between the inspection services and PTP
X management. Three main lessons were learned: (a) establishment of good
management is a difficult but not impossible task; (b) consultants should be
selected carefully, appointed early and their performance monitored by a
central government body, possibly Team Khusus (DGE); and (c) sound and
timely reporting procedures facilitate the identification and solution of
problems.
1.        A full completion report was prepared by the implementing agency
PTP X in September 1981. This was supplemented by the findings of a Bank
PCR mission which visited the project area in December 1981. The present
document provides a summary of the information contained in the more
detailed reports available in the regional file.
2.         The Fourth Agricultural Estate Project, approved by IDA in
June 1972, was designed to rehabilitate rubber and palm oil estates in the
PNP X area in South Sumatra.
3.         The project was identified by consultants, Guthrie International
Plantation Services (GIPS), of Kuala Lumpur in late 1971 and appraised by
IDA in December 1971. Negotiations took place in May 1972 and Board
Presentation in late June 1972.

4.         Implementation.  The project was designed to encompass the overall
rehabilitation of PNP X,/1 by planting 7,400 ha of oil palm and 4,000 ha of
rubber, improving standards of husbandry for 2,000 ha of existing oil palms
and 9,700 ha of mature and immature rubber, constructing one palm oil mill
and two block rubber factories, and rehabilitating, expanding and replacing
existing processing facilities, estate transportation and buildings. Man-
agement would be reorganized and strengthened and supported by engineering
and field advisory services.  'Technical assistance would also be provided
for marketing and crop diversification studies.
5.         Soon after effectiveness, the consultant inspectors carried out a
detailed analysis of the project area and, on the basis of soil and climatic
data, coupled with a re-assessment of relative price prospects for rubber
and palm oil, recommended a substantially different planting program. After
a number of consultations on the subject with PTP X management and RSI a
revised program was agreed in June 1975. This program was changed again in
1977 (para. 7). Some of these changes could have been avoided had the above
factors been adequately assessed during project preparation.
6.         Field Development.  Planting progressed smoothly since project
inception and was always carried out ahead of schedule (see key indicators
Annex I). Standards of planting and maintenance were good.
7.        Reassured by the satisfactory performance of PTP X under this
project, and to further support GOI policy of a rapid expansion of tree crop
development, the Bank agreed in 1976 to appraise the first Nucleus Estate and
Smallholders project (NES I) to be partially carried out by PTP X in the
project area. The new project included a smallholder rubber and food crop
component for 5,730 families on about 11,250 ha. As NES I operations
started in 1977, to clearly separate costs under the two projects, the
planting program under Cr. 319-IND was completed by considering all 1976/77
planting as having been done under the project and transferring all future
planting to NES I. Thus, ultimately, 6,924 ha of rubber and 5,052 ha of oil
palm were attributed to the Fourth Estates project. In all, some 11,976 ha
were planted compared to the appraisal target of 11,400 ha.
8.        Processing facilities.  The SAR anticipated that a 60 ton FFB/hr
mill would be required at Kedaton, and a new 10 ton FFB/hr mill would be
built at Bekri in 1981. In 1974, based on higher oil palm yield projection,
GOI and IDA agreed to proposals for the expansion of the new Bekri mill from
the initial 20 ton/hr to 40 ton/hr. At the same time a reduction of oil
/1 At inception the estate had the juridical status of a PNP, a state-owned
enterprise. In 1980 its status was changed in a PTP a public corpora-
tion with limited liability. All references in this P.C.R. will be
PTP X.

palm area around Kedaton eliminated the need for a new mill in that area.
The contract for Bekri Phase I was signed in July 1975 and the plant was
expected to be commissioned in July 1977. Due to delays in construction
the mill was completed in July 1978 and was commissioned in February 1979.
Thereafter, a number of technical problems developed which resulted in
financial losses estimated at about Rp 300 million in that year.
10.       IDA recommended a series of corrective steps of which particularly
important was the strengthening PTP X engineering staff to ensure good
management of facilities being installed under the project. This resulted
in the establishment of a technical task force formed by experienced
engineers from other estates. The task force, set up in 1979, took over
technical responsibilities and improved operating performance and
accelerated finishing and commissioning (July 1981) of Bekri Phase II. Oil
extraction in the Bekri mill was increased from 12% to 20% but the kernel
extraction although improved from 0.9 to 1.8% was still only 50% of
forecast. The technical task force is expected to be merged soon with the
technical department to avoid duplication of functions and strengthen
planning and engineering capabilities in PTP X.
11.       For rubber, the construction of the Way Berulu 20 tons/day Crum
Rubber Factory started in July 1980 and was commissioned in early 1982.
12.       Technological innovation in the new rubber factory resulted in
improved processing efficiency, belter quality control and modernization of
packaging.
13.       Panjang Bulking Installation.  The SAR had also proposed the
construction of a port storage and pumping installation at the port of
Panjang for 5,000 tons of palm oil for local and export sales. However,
due to the reduction of the oil palm planting program and changes in the
market situation (all PTP X Lampung palm oil production is now consumed
locally) the construction was halted after completing one storage tank and
the related equipment.
14.       Procurement.  A number of problems encountered in initiating the
project were largely due to PTP X's inexperience with Bank ICB procedures
and the GOI's own cumbersome procurement procedures. However, as the
project progressed, GOI gained more direct experience on how to deal with
procurement of fertilizers and equipment under other NES bank-financed
projects.  ICB procurement procedures generally followed Bank guidelines,
although it took an average 400 days from the preparation of tender
documents to the delivery of material and equipment to the project site.
15.       Project Costs.  Total project costs (Annex II) were Rp 16,277
million (US$36.3 million) as against the appraisal estimate of Rp 9,096
million (US$21.9 million). Cost overruns were due to changes in
planting from oil palm to rubber and factory construction programs (27%) and
inflation (73%).

16.       IDA Disbursements.  The US$11 million credit was closed on
June 30, 1981, having committed all but US$30,776 which were cancelled.
17.       Figure 1 indicates that the rate of disbursement paralleled the
Bankwide average for tree crop projects and the average for East Asia agri-
cultural projects during the first three years of project implementation,
lagged in years 5 and 6, but accelerated subsequently. The total disburse-
ment period was in line with the overall average for tree crop lending, and
East Asia agricultural projects.
18.       Operating Performance.  Standards achieved in the planting and
maintenance of rubber and oil palm compare favorably with SAR's estimates.
Calculation of a yield profile from 12,800 ha showed a rubber mean yield of
1,218/kg/ha as against a SAR estimate of 1,200/kg/ha. Oil palm yields from
new plantings averaged 14.8 tons of FFB/ha during the first four years as
against a SAR forecast of 13.8 tons of FFB/ha but the improvement on
rehabilitated areas was slightly below expectation.
19.       All project oil palm plantings were made with DxP seed produced at
the Marihat Research Station. Development of the young palms has been
excellent and early yields are above expectation. Since Marihat material
had been condemned as unsatisfactory in the earlier Estate projects, those
results mark a significant step forward in Indonesia-s ability to meet her
planting material needs without recourse to foreign supplier.
20.       With respect to other crops envisaged by the project, PTP X has
succeeded, with technical assistance from consultants, in establishing
159 ha of excellent irrigated coconut seed gardens for the production of
dwarf x tall hybrid seed nuts. The production of hybrid seed which in 1981
reached 2 million nuts, is expected to rise to 2.7 million nuts when the
gardens reach maturity. There are also 46 ha of tall palms (the male
parents) including West African, Tahitian, Rennel and local varieties, and
223 ha of trial plantings of hybrid and other material.
21.       Financial Performance.  PTP X was expected at appraisal to have
considerable initial cash generating and cash flow problems. However, PTP
X-s financial performance, bolstered by high rubber prices has exceeded
expectations. Its income rose from a net loss of Rp 157,000 in 1972 to a
pretax profit of about Rp 7 billion in 1981, or from a loss of about 17% of
the sales revenue in 1972 to a profit before taxes of 43% in 1981. In terms
of major crops, net income from rubber in real terms (1981 prices) increased                X
from a loss of Rp 333 million in 1971 to an estimated profit of Rp 3,023
million in 1981, and net income from palm oil rose from a loss of Rp 48
million in 1971 to an estimated profit of Rp 1,851 million in 1981.

22.        PTP X-s assets (Annex 3) increased from Rp 1 billion in 1972 to
Rp 50 billion in 1981, or to Rp 19.6 billion in constant 1972 prices, a
20-fold increase in real terms in less than 10 years. Despite this expansion,
PTP X capital structure is satisfactory with a 0.5:1 long-term debt to net
worth ratio and 1.3:1 current ratio. During project implementation PTP X-s
capital was increased by a GOI injection of equity in 1978 and by the
countrywide revaluation of assets in 1979.  However, in recent years when
*            the estate's profitability was particularly high, PTP X should have been
allowed to retain earnings and capitalize them to increase its long-term
leverage potential. Cost overruns were entirely borne by PNP X, an
f            additional indication that the estate had substantially improved financially
under the project.
23.        Management Performance.  The project provided substantial tech-
nical assistance services which resulted in a strengthening of PTP X's
management. Some ineffective managers were replaced, and selected technical
staff were sent to Malaysia for training. Organizational achievements of
special relevance were: the establishment of a functional corporate struc-
ture based on two operational departments, one for field and factory produc-
tion and the other for financial administration and commercial activities;
and the introduction of a planning and control Management Information System
(MIS) that considerably improved internal auditing, field inventory control,
record keeping and capital and short-term budgeting. This led to a more
realistic forecast of revenue, expenditures and operating cost savings.
24.        Consultants' Performance.  The performance of the principal
technical advisers, was uneven. In the initial phase, they provided a
valuable input in establishing the programs and budgets and in guiding
estate operations. Their six-monthly visits provided a needed stimulus,
and the performance of estate managers improved, as did the standard of
reporting but guidance on engineering and processing aspects was at times
inadequate. Technical agricultural advice was generally satisfactory but
conservative; it should have been more up-to-date and more flexible.
Eventually, PTP X called in new consultants, to advise on the rubber
operations.
25.        Accounting, Auditing and Reporting.  PTP X's record-keeping
standards have improved considerably during project implementation. Its
accounts are now well kept and regularly audited by an independent CPA firm.
The auditors' reports are supported by extensive and informative statements
and comply with IDA's standard requirements. Internal auditing carried out
by a PTP X seven-man team systematically reviews accounts and checks on
labor force presence, work in progress and inventory control.  Quarterly
progress reporting, though often late, has been satisfactory.

26.       Economic Benefits.  Costs and benefits for the revised economic
rate of return are expressed in constant 1981 Rupiahs. International and
domestic price indices were used to adjust prices. The exchange rate used
was, Rp 415 per US$ from 1973 through 1978, and Rp 625 thereafter. In order
to conform as far as possible with the methodology adopted at appraisal,
labor was not shadow priced although, due to transmigration into the project
area, labor of roughly the same skill would be abundantly available and the
opportunity cost would probably not exceed 50% of the actual wage rate.                   )
Fertilizer prices, which are subsidized, were brought in line with the
international price. The project evaluation period was 30 years (1973-2002).
Under the above assumptions, treating the project as a time-slice of PTP X's
total operations with all investment prior to 1973 considered as sunk costs,
the economic rate of return for rubber is 38% and for palm oil 20% compared
with the SAR-s rubber ERR 28%, and oil palm ERR 13%. The overall ERR is 30%
(SAR 19%).
27.       Foreign exchange earnings, projected at appraisal to reach US$10
million by 1985, reached US$17 million in 1980 and are projected to rise to
US$30 million by 1985. The project created about 4,000 new permanent jobs
(SAR 2,500) housed about 3,500 estate workers families and had a beneficial
impact on the standard of living of transmigrants in the project area. It
is recognized that organizational, technical, and financial benefits arising
out of the project would not have been achieved without it.
28.       The project contributed to increased Indonesian rubber and palm
oil production, and by strengthening PTP X it led the way to the inclusion
of smallholder components in Bank-financed projects for PTP X as well as
other PNP/PTPs. To date, six nucleus estates projects have been appraised
assisting about 57,000 families to cultivate about 66,000 ha of rubber,
27,000 ha of oil palm and 10,000 ha of coconut. The success of these
projects and their agricultural, technical and financial impact is due in
large part to the fact that they incorporate lessons learned from earlier
agricultural estate projects of which 319-IND was one of the most
significant.
29.       Principal successes of the project were:  the attainment of the
production objectives which involved doubling rubber production and
increasing palm oil production 20-fold; establishment of a sound
organizational base, accompanied by improved confidence and capability of
staff at all levels but especially in the technical department; and
transformation of PTP X from one of the poorest to one of the most
successful of the 29 government tree crops estates.
30.       Principal project weaknesses were:  initially slow procurement and
failure to establish effective communication between the inspection services
and PTP X-s management, which caused some delays and errors in the installa-
tion of processing equipment.



-7-
32.       The main lessons learned were that:  (a) the establishment of good
management is a difficult but not impossible task; (b) technical assistance
and training of staff are vital to strengthening management; (c) consultants
should be appointed early and their performance monitored by a central GOI
body, possibly Team Khusus (DGE); and (c) brief but appropriate and timely
reporting procedures facilitate the identification and solution of problems.
The project also indicated that GOI should promote a policy of inter-estate
transfer of technical and financial assistance.  On the technical side the
project suffered from inadequacies in preparation and appraisal, which
resulted in conflicting views as to the best use of the land available and
necessitated substantial changes in project design during implementation.
There is a clear need for a program of adaptive research to provide reliable
data on fertilizer needs and to develop improved agronomic techniques for
exploitation and maintenance.
