APPRAISAL OF A POPULATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a population project for Trinidad and Tobago
for which a Bank loan of US$ 3.0 million equivalent is proposed. Increased
efforts in population planning are essential to redress the imbalance between
population and resources which has led to slow progress in improving living
standards, large scale unemployment, emigration of skilled personnel and social
unrest. In response to these problems the Government adopted a population
policy in 1967. Although achievements have been substantial in the past two
years, performance in 1970 declined to less than two-thirds of the 1969 level.
The main constraints of the program have been organizational, insufficient
numbers of medical and paramedical personnel committed to family planning,
inadequate physical facilities and insufficient emphasis on postpartum efforts
to motivate mothers in family planning after delivery.
ii.       The project is designed to overcome these above limitations.  While
funds will be devoted primarily to the construction and equipment of facilities,
this alone is insufficient to improve the performance of the whole program.
The technical assistance component of the project and the measures accompany-
ing the project are therefore designed as a critical supplement to the
financing of facilities.
iii.      The project provides for the design, construction and equipment of
the following facilities:
(a)    Medical facilities to provide expanded opportunities for family
planning education and services and consisting of:
- a new 100-bed maternity hospital at Mount Hope including a family
planning clinic.
-  seven new health centers in which family planning sessions will
be held; of these four would have a four-bed delivery unit
attached to them; and one four-bed delivery unit would be added
to an existing health center.
- a family planning clinic attached to the San Fernando Hospital
to replace the present inadequate clinic.
(b)    Training facilities to improve the basic training of nurses for
family planning and other family planning workers by:
- extending and replacing the existing facilities of the Port-of-
Spain Nursing School to increase teaching and supporting
facilities from about 200 to 500 students and to provide dormitories
for 100 additional students.
- building a new rural community health center at Arima to train
medical, nursing and other personnel in rural public health work
with emphasis on family planning.



- ii -
- building a Family Planning Institute for training of family
planning workers and community leaders and for administrative
offices.
iv.        The technical assistance component of the project includes advisory
services to (a) improve administrative procedure and the organization of the
family planning program; (b) develop an internal system of continuous evalua-
tion of the effect of the program on fertility; (c) introduce family life
education in schoolo by 1973; (d) strengthen the training of nurses in family
planning; and (e) study the functions of family planning personnel to achieve
their efficient utilisation. Provision is also made for an external mission
to review the overall progress of the program and recommend the most suitable
methods of program expansion.
v.          Several important measures for program success will accompany the
project. Among them are organizational changes in the Ministry of Health to
integrate family planning with maternal and child health (MCH) services; and
to ensure the involvement of the top echelons of the Ministry of Health in
the administration of these combined services.
vi.        Total project cost is estimated at US$ 4.6 million (TT$ 9.1 million).
The proposed Bank loan of US$ 3.0 million, equal to about 66% of total project
cost will finance the full foreign exchange component of US$ 2.6 million plus
interest and commitment charges on the Bank loan during construction equal to
US$ 0.4 million.
yii.       The Project Unit, presently in the Ministry of Works, and responsible
for the implementation of the Bank-financed education project (Loan No. 564 -
Trinidad and Tobago - October 16, 1968) would be suitably reinforced and adapted
to execute the population project as well. One or more local architectural firms,
and a foreign consulting firm, would be responsible for design and tendering.
Contracts for civil works and furniture and equipment would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding. Domestic manufacturers of furniture
and equipment would be accorded at 15% preferential margin.
viii.      The project is estimated to increase new acceptors from 10,000 in
1970 to 22,000 per year from 1980 onwards. As a result of this, the birth
rate is estimated to decrease from 27/1,000 in 1969 to 15.5/1,000 in 1980.
The rate of population growth will be reduced from a projected level of 1.5%
per year in 1980 without the project to a level of 0.9% with the project. By
the year 2000 the population would be 6.2% smaller than otherwise and the labor
force 5.2% smaller. These demographic trends will improve living standards
and alleviate the long term unemployment problem. The project will also improve
the conditions under which deliveries are performed and the health and welfare
of mothers and children. The project will improve the management capability
of the Ministry of Health and in particular the family planning program.
ix.        Subject to the provisions in para. 7.01 - 7.03, the proposed project
is suitable for a Bank loan of US$ 3.0 million equivalent to the Government of
Trinidad and Tobago for a period of 25 years, including a 10 year grace period.



TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
APPRAISAL OF A POPULATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Following informal contacts between the Bank and the Government,
the Ministers of Finance and Health confirmed the Government's interest in
possible Bank Group assistance to the family planning program at the Annual
Meeting in September, 1969. In November, the Government submitted a proposal
for assistance and requested the Bank to send a mission to review this proposal
in the context of the family planning efforts of Trinidad and Tobago.
1.02      A preparation mission consisting of Mr. G. Zaidan (Chief), Mr. M.
M4ilo (Architectural Consultant) and Dr. M. Thangavelu (Medical Consultant)
visited Trinidad and Tobago in March, 1970.  Mr. Guijt from the Bank assisted
the mission in the field and during report writing in Washington. This was
followed by an appraisal mission in October, 1970 which consisted of
Mr. G. Zaidan (Chief), Dr. L. S. Sodhy (Medical Consultant and Deputy Chief),
Miss I. Z. Husain and Mrs. M. N. Maraviglia from the Bank, Mr. M. Milo
(Architectural Consultant), Mrs S. Landauer (Nursing Consultant - PAHO),
and Dr. D. F. Tirador (Medical Consultant - PAHO).
II. THE POPULATION PROBLEM AND GOVERNMENT POLICY
2.01      The population of Trinidad and Tobago was 275,000 persons at the
turn of the century. It doubled in the text 46 years and doubled again in the
next 23 years to reach 1.03 million in 1969. This was mainly due to a large
decline in the death rate from 25 per 1,000 at the beginning of the century to
7 per 1,000 in 1969. The birth rate remained high from 1900 (37/1,000) to 1962
(38/1,000). Since then it has declined to 27 per 1,000 in 1969, indicating a
genuine decline in fertility as the General Fertility Rate, or the number
of births per 1,000 women in the childbearing ages,declined from 181 in 1962
to 135 in 1969. The 1960's also witnessed a change from immigration up to
1963 to increasing emigration since 1964. Though the rate of natural increase
was high in 1969 (2.0%), the effect of emigration in that year was to reduce
the rate of growth of the population to 1.3%. Past high levels of fertility
have resulted in an unfavorable age structure with 42% of the population being
less than 15 years of age in 1969. Population density stood at the high level
of 530 persons per sq mi.  Also, about 45% of the population lived in St. George
County, a large urbanized area. Annex 1 gives further details on recent
population trends.
2.02      If family planning efforts continue at their present level, the
population is projected to increase to 1.52 million in the year 2000. This
estimate is based on a decline in the birth rate to 23/1,000 by 1977 and to
14/1,000 in the year 2000, no emigration and a constant death rate. Greater
efforts in family planning would lead to a slower population growth rate
(para. 6.04).
2.03      The above population trends have serious economic implications.  The
economy of Trinidad and Tobago which was mainly based on the production of



-2-
agricultural trade crops before the Second World War, has since then relied
heavily on oil as the main source of growth of the economy. The Gross National
Product (GNP) reached a real annual growth of 10% in the second half of the
fifties but due to low oil production, the figure was reduced to 4.5% in 1960-65,
3.7% in 1965-69 and reached the low level of 2.2% in 1968-70. The prospects for
further oil expansion are unlikely to sustain long term economic development.
While the Third Five-Year Plan recognized these difficulties and call for the di-
versification of tne economy this will require large investment resources. Given
these long term prospects, the need to reduce population growth becomes particularly
important.
2.04      These economic pressures have led to emigration and unemployment
problems. About 9,000 persons equal to one half of the net addition of the popu-
lation have emigrated annually in 1967 and 1968; and close to this number is
estimated to have emigrated in 1969 whereas between 1961 and 1963 there had
been net immigration. This drain of skilled personnel such as doctors, nurses
and teachers has created shortages of needed manpower. Despite emigration
there has been an increase in unemployment from 37,000 in 1960 to 53,400 in
1968; in the latter year 14% of the labor force was unemployed. The Third
Five-Year Plan (1969-1973) estimates that over 150,000 jobs will have to be pro-
4ded in the 1974-83 decade to eliminate unemployment.  This will require - on
the basis of the capital-labor ratio estimated in the Plan - an investment of
TT$ 3,500 million during this period. This is about a fourfold increase in the
total net investment of the Third Five-Year Plan. It implies unrealistic
increases in domestic savings rates or foreign aid and underlines the gravity
of the unemploymetit problem.
2.05      In response to these demographic and economic trends, the Government
has adopted a policy of population planning. The target of the Government is
to reduce the birth rate from 27/1,000 in 1969 to 20/1,000 by 1977 and reach
20,000 new acceptors per year. In April, 1967 a special convention of the
People's National Movement, the ruling political party, requested the Govern-
ment "to institute a national program of education in family planning and to
introduce a family planning program on a national scale to cater for the needs
and desires of all". A Population Council (PC) was established in June, 1967
to advise the Minister of Health on the organization of a national program and
to coordinate all family planning activities in the country.
2.06      The prospects of the success of family planning efforts are encourag-
ing for the following reasons:
(1)   there is no organized opposition to family planning in spite of the
racial and religious diversity of the population; though one-third
of the population is Catholic, the Church adopts a neutral position
with respect to the program (para. 3.04);
(2)   there is a strong demand for family planning services as indicated
by the decline in the birth rate and the large number of abortions.
There are more than 5,000 abortions per year of which a substantial
portion is induced; and
(3)   the small size of the country, the high level of literacy (90%), the
advanced state of health services, and the high proportion of
institutional deliveries (62%) should make the provision of family
planning services relatively easy.

III. FAMILY PLANNING EFFORTS
A. Progress of the Program
Organization
3.01      The national family planning program is part of the health services
of the country (Annex 2). Program implementation is carried out through the
maternal and child health services. For health purposes, Trinidad is divided
into three regions -- north, south and Tobago. A Regional Director supervises
health activities in each region and reports directly to the Chi6f Medical
Officer(CMO). The Director of the family planning program reports to the CMO
through the Principal Medical Officer, Integrated Medical Care (PMO0IS). Family
planning is only one of the numerous responsibilities of the PMO,1S; it is at
a low level within the organization of the Ministry of Health.
3.02      The Population Council (PC) advises the Minister of Health on all
aspects of program implementation and coordinates the activities of the
national program with the activities of other organizations such as the
private Family Planning Association (YPA) and the Catholic Marriage Advisory
Council (CMAC) (Annex 2). The PC is headed by a Chairman appointed by the
Cabinet and the secretary is the Director of the program. Other members of
the Council include various representatives from the government sector,
community leaders, the FPA and the CMAC. Various specialized committees and
sub-committees assist the PC in policy formulation in the areas of program
formulation, education and publicity, and research and evaluation. Annex 2
lists these committees and their composition.
3.03      The FPA, a voluntary organization affiliated to the International
Planned Parenthood Federationwas established in 1956, but it was only in 1964
that the activities of the FPA became sizable. Another expansion took place
in 1968 when the Government fixed a target for the Association and started to
subsidize it. While the FPA was responsible for nearly half of clinical
services in 1969 in the country the emphasis is increasingly shifting to the
Government program. As a result the FPA in addition to providing services
through its eight clinics, has begun to concentrate on some aspects of training
and publicity.
3.04      The CMAC was founded in 1964 to advise couples on family planning
methods compatible with their moral beliefs; in 1968 the CMAC offered
instruction in the temperature-rhythm method. It employs a full-time nurse
and is subsidized by the Government. It had close to 500 acceptors in 1969
and 300 in 1970.
Program Results
3.05      Achievements to date Lave fallen sLLort of the target of 20,030 new
acceptors per year but they have been substantial. The number of new acceptors

While over 16,000 women accepted family planning services in 1969 (80% of the
target) performance has declined to less than 9,500 new acceptors (50% of the
target) in 1970. Such a rapid decline may have been due to the political
disturbances of last spring and adverse rumors on oral contraceptives combined
with increasing efforts needed to enlist additional acceptors. This decline
calls for renewed and sustained efforts. Annex 3 gives further details on the
performance of the family planning program.
3.06      The Postpartum Program.  In Trinidad 62% of births occur in institutions
and 90% of these in the three largest hospitals (Port-of-Spain, San Fernando
and Scarborough). In June 1969 a postpartum program was introduced in these
hospitals whereby nurse-midwives motivated -mothers immediately after delivery. This
program has had limited success (only 12% of women who deliver became acceptors)
because of:
(i)    the medical and paramedical personnel in these hospitals are
not sufficinetly trained in and committed to the provision of
1family planning services;
(ii)   the short stay of patients in hospitals -- less than two days in the
majority of cases;  during this period women are less receptive to
family planning education than in the third and fourth day; and
(iii)  the seven nurses that motivate women are insufficient to cover all
cases -- the time allotted to each patient (including clerical work)
does not exceed 5 minutes.
Facilities
3.07      In 1969, 19 Government family planning clinics were in operation with
more than 30 weekly sessions.  In 1970, 9 more clinics were added, bringing
total sessions to more than 39. In spite of this increase and a fall in
acceptors in 1970, there wem 54.2 old and new cases per doctor session in 1970
as against the norm of the Government of 25. Further, many of these clinics
were located in health offices with inadequate physical facilities. Finally,
there were no facilities for regular training of doctors, nurses, administrators
and paramedical personnel in family planning.
Contraceptive Methods
3.08      The program is based on the "cafeteria approach" whereby acceptors
can choose the method most suitable for them.  All methods, except vasectomies
which are not acceptable for cultural reasons, are offered in the national
program. Acceptors of pillsand IUDs have to be examined first by a doctor.
In 1969, 75% of acceptors chose the pill, 4% the IUD and 21% other methods.
The acceptance pattern is changing; in 1970,60.6% accepted the pill, 5.6%
the IUD and 33.8% other methods such as the condoms and jelly. This was due
to rumors associated with the pill in early 1970. The shift towards other
methods means that the program is having a smaller effect because of their
lower effectiveness.
}4otivation
3.09 Face-to-Face. A pilot project Qf home visiting to motiyate women who do
not deliver in hospitals and to follow up acceptors through non-medical family



-5-
planning aides began in July 1970. About eight women aged 25-45 with back-
grounds of work in the community (community development workers, student
nurses who were unable to qualify, etc.) received an intensive two week
training course and were assigned to two urban, three semi-urban and two rural
areas covering a population of about 1,200 persons each. The results of this
project are still not available.
3.10 Group and Mass Media. In addition to face-to-face motivation in the
postpartum program some group talks are given in health centers and out-
patient clinics. The Government has also used the mass media for advertising
the family planning program. Two mobile units supplied by PAH0 in May 1970
visited schools, clinics and community centers, to show films for education
and training; this is followed by short lectures and discussions. There are
also daily programs on radio. TV will be used in early 1972 for daily
programs which are being developed.
Personnel
3.11      In 1970, the national program employed one full-time and 20 part-
time doctors, two full-time and 40 part-time nurse-midwives, and four part-
time midwives. The postpartum program carried out in the three biggest
hospitals employed seven nurses. The FPA employed three full-time and two
part-time doctors, five full-time nurse-midwives, four nurses and six midwives.
3.12      The shortage of personnel in the program (para. 3.06 and 3.07) is
a reflection of a more general shortage in the health services. In November
1970 out of 243 posts of medical officers only 145 were filled (Annex 3)
leaving a deficit of close to 100 doctors. In November, 1970 the total number
of posts of various types of nursing personnel (public health nurses, district
health visitors, midwives and nursing instructors) was 462 of which 127 were
vacant   (Annex 3).  The main cause of these shortages is inadequate supply
and the emigration of such personnel.
3.13      More important than the shortage of personnel is their insufficient
training in family planning; also some doctors and nurses are not fully aware
of the population problem and do not consider family planning work to be as
attractive professionally as other medical work.
Evaluation and Research
3.14      Although elaborate, the present system is not adequate for identify-
ing and following up acceptors who leave the program or estimating program
effects on fertility. This is because much of the data that are collected
remain in the clinics and are not aggregated and analysed and also because of
the unavailability of some important data.
Costs
3.15      The allocated expenditures to family planning are not largp --
amounting to 7% to 8% of the total expenditure of the Ministry of Health
during 1968-70. However, actual expenditures were less than allocations
indicating that the program could not absorb the available funds rapidly.
The cost per acceptor was around US$ 8-10 in 1968 and 1969 and has increased
to US$ 12 in 1970. This is an average figure - higher than in the family
planning programs of China and   Korea but lower than Jamaica where the
comparable figure is about US$ 25. Expenditures between 1968-70 (in 000 of
TT$ and US$) were as follows:



-6-
1968          1969            1970 (estimated)
US$   TT$      US$   TT$       US$   TT$
Government Program         30    60        80   159       121   242
FPA                        75   149       126   252        40    80
Total                     105   209       206   411       161   322
Foreign Assistance
3.16      The level of foreign assistance to Trinidad has been low and has
been confined mostly to SIDA and PAHO. SIDA provided US$ 29,400 for pills
in 1968 and US$ 70,000 in 1969 for pills and condoms. The Population Council
provided US$ 2,300 for IUDs in 1968. SIDA and PAHO supplied clinic equipment
for 20 clinics. In 1969, PAHO's contribution was around US$ 60,000 for such
equipment. In the same year PAHO also provided US$ 30,000 for two mobile
units for showing films for education and training (para. 3.09). Fellowships
and short-term consultants were also provided. Requests for equipping 28
additional clinics have been made to PAHO and SIDA. SIDA also pleged itself
to supply all needed contraceptives in 1971-72.
B. Program Constraints
3.17      The problems discussed above provide the basis for the project's
physical facilities and technical assistance components. However, other
measures, are also important for program success. In some cases studies
within the technical assistance component of the project will help to
evaluate the effectiveness of these measures. These are discussed below.
Organization
3.18      To raise the status of family planning in the general structure of
health services there should be a larger involvement of the top echelons of
the Ministry of Health than is the case at present. The persons presently in
charge of the program are too low in the organizational structure, do not
have executive authority and do not have the necessary background and
experience to be influential with the medical profession. To overcome these
limitations the present PMO-IS should devote her principal efforts to MCH and
family planning. She now spends only 10-15% of her time for such services.
The Government agreed, during negotiations to appoint another PMO to relieve
the present PMO-IS of some of the duties so that she can devote her
principal efforts to such services. A detailed schedule of duties of the
present PMO-IS, was agreed during negotiations and will be confirmed to the
Bank. Any subsequent major increase in this schedule will be made in con-
sultation with the Bank. Agreement was also reached during negotiations on
the qualifications of the PMO responsible for MCH and family planning services.
The Bank's comments shall be taken into account in the selection of an official
to this post. The appointment of an additional PMO is a condition of loan
effectiveness.



-7-
Inadequate Postpartum Efforts
3.19      It is important that postpartum efforts be rapidly expanded by:
(1)    increasing the number of nurse-midwives that motivate recently
delivered mothers from 7 to 21 to allow such motivation to be con-
ducted morning and afternoon on every day of the week, including
Saturdays and Sundays;
(ii)   improving training of postpartum educators;
(iii)  expanding the postpartum program to hospitals like Arima, Sangre,
Grande, Couva and Point Fortin;
(iv)   extending postpartum motivation to the homes of patients in the six
weeks after discharge from hospital; and
(v)    reducing the pressure on maternity beds in San Fernando Hospital,
the second largest in the countryj by building a pediatric unit which
is planned by the Government; this would allow the 30 existing
pediatric beds to be used for maternity services. A timetable for
building this unit has been agreed to during negotiations.
Personnel Problems
3.20 Shortage of Nurses. The Government is acutely aware of this shortage
(para. 4.13 and Annex 7) and is considering ways of dealing with this problem.
These include measures to :
(a)   counteract the emigration of nurses, which represented about 52%
of the number of graduates in 1970 (Annex 4 gives further details).
These include:
(i)   a system (similar to that prevailing for other Government
Departments) whereby nurses who are trained at Government
expense have to sign a bond which requires them to serve
the Government after graduation for three years including
one year of internship. If they resign before the bonding
period is completed they have to pay the amount of the
bond, which is determined on the basis of the cost of
training. Implementation of this measure is a condition
of loan effectiveness.
(ii) a compulsory internship period following graduation. The
Nursing Council agrees in principle to such measure.
Assurances have been obtained that the Government shall
make best efforts to introduce this as early as possible.
(b)   improve the working conditions of nurses so that the attraction of
emigration is reduced. This may include such measures as better
prospects of promotion, more clerical assistance, better supplies



-8-
and equipment, etc. The technical assistance component of the
project will provide for studying feasible and effective ways of
securing this (para. 4.19).
3.21 Functions of Doctors and Nurses. The overall shortage of personnel is
compounded because new acceptors are required to be examined by a doctor
before being given the pill or IUD. This has made it impossible to offer
family planning services at clinics with no doctors. Nurses or midwives
should be allowed to examine patients and dispense contraceptives other than
IUDs and refer cases with complications to doctors. The medical profession
may resist this but as a minimum, assurances haye been obtained from the Govern-
ment during negotiations that patients would be given contraceptives by nurse-
midwives with the instruction that they should be referred to a doctor when
necessary. This measure would allow services to become more readily available
to the community. Subsequently, a study planned within the technical assistance
component of the project (para. 4.21), should seek to measure the increased
efficiency in program operation resulting from expanded functions of nurses.
3.22      There has been little effort to date to concentrate on the poorer
sections of the population who do not deliver in hospitals and go only rarelv
to health centers. While the Family Planning Aide pilot project is designed
to meet this constraint, there is some resistance within the nursing pro-
fession to the use of non-medical personnel in family planning motivation.
If this pilot project proves successful its extension on an island-wide basis
should include (a) an understanding of all members of the health services of
the functions of these aides so that they become accepted; to this end
nursing staff should receive special orientation to the aide program;
(b) more intensive training than the present two week course; and (c) super-
vision from senior aides who in turn should report to the District Nurse. If,
however, the results are not promising, a suitable alternative to
motivate women who do not deliver in hospitals, should be adopted -- for
example more extensive home visiting by District Nurses. Assurances have been ob-
tained that the Government will extend the present scheme or adopt a suitable
alternative (by March 1972), in consultation with the Bank, to reach the
poorer sections of the population.
Family Planning and MCH Services
3.23      Health Centers now provide medical care for ambulant patients suffer-
ing from all types of ailments and also render antenatal, postnatal and child
health services. Family planning services are provided at separate sessions.
It may be more effective if they are made available at most sessions of the
Health Centers. A pilot project at certain health centers (Mayaro, Cedrps
and Toco) should be started by July 1971.  After a period of three months, the
project, if successful, should be extended in its second phase to some other
health centers (Siparia, Roy Joseph Street/San Fernando, Indian Walk,
Carapichaima, Debe, Manzanilla, Roxborough, San Rafael and Talparo). The
technical assistance component of the project should help evaluate the effective-
ness of this scheme (para. 4.18). Its possible extension to the whole country
or a suitable modification thereof should be made in consultation with the
Bank. The Government has agreed to such arrangements during negotiations.

IV. THE PROJECT
4.01      The project is intended to extend and improve the Government's
National Family Planning Program by (a) adding new facilities and equipment;
(b) training the needed personnel; and (c) providing technical assistance
particularly for evaluation, training and introducing family life education
in schools. Project funds will be devoted primarily for construction and
equipment of facilities. To improve the effectiveness of the whole family
planning program, however, the technical assistance components (which are
small in amount) as well as the measures accompanying the project are basic.
A. Project Componients
Physical Facilities
4.02      The przject provides for the design, construction and equipment
of the following facilities (Annexes 5 and 7 give details of the project's
physical facilities);
(a)   Medical Facilities to provide expanded opportunities for family
planning education and services. This consists of:
-  a new 100-bed maternity hospital at Mount Hope including a
family planning clinic; this will be a teaching hospital where
student nurses would do their midwifery training including
family planning;
-  seven new health centers in which family planning sessions will
be held;  of these four would have a four-bed delivery unit
attached to them; and one four-bed delivery unit would be added
to an existing health center:
- a family planning clinic attached to the San Fernando Hospital
to replace the present inadequate clinic.
(b)   Training Facilities to improve the basic training of nurses for
family planning and other family planning workers. This consists of:
-  extending and replacing the existing facilities of the Port-of-
Spain Nursing School to increase teaching and supporting
facilities from 200 to 500 students and to provide dormitories
for 100 additional students; and
-  a new rural community health center at Arima to train medical,
nursing and other personnel in rural public health work with
emphasis on family planning; and
-  a Family Planning Institute for training of family planning
workers and community leaders and for administrative offices.
Technical Assistance
4.03      The project has the following technical assistance components:



-10-
a.   Advisory Services to:
- develop procedures for effective administration of the maternal
and child health and family planning program;
- develop a system for continuous evaluation of the program with
a view to recommending changes in the program to evaluate
its impact on the birth rate;
- introduce family life education in schools;
- integrate family planning in the basic curriculum of nurses and
improve the training courses of family planning workers; and
- study the functions of doctors, nurses and other personnel in
the family planning program and recommend changes to secure the
efficient use of such personnel.
b.   Architectural services to ensure that the construction component of
the project is designed in accordance with the Government's needs
and to supervise the implementation of this component.
c.   An External Review Mission staffed by international consultants to
evaluate the overall progress of the program and recommend the most
suitable methods for program expansion.
Mount Hope Maternity Hospital
4.04      This new 100-bed maternity hospital will be located in St. George
County, the most densely populated area in the country with the largest short-
age of maternity beds. The hospital will have 60 obstetric beds (10 antenatal
and 50 postnatal), 20 abortion and 20 gynecological beds. It will be a
teaching hospital where student nurses in the Port-of-Spain Nursing School
would do their midwifery training including family planning. It will include
a family planning clinic which would be used for training in family planning.
4.05      The Mount Hope Hospital will be important for family planning efforts
in several respects. First, it will allow the effective motivation of mothers
after  delivery   and other potential acceptors of family planning services.
Present pressure on beds is acute; the average length of stay of women with
normal delivery was 1.5 days in the Port-of-Spain Hospital (Annex 6). This is
too short a period for effective postpartum motivation. The Mount Hope
Hospital is projected to handle 2,900 annual deliveries, allowing a length of
stay of five to six days. In addition, 1,400 annual abortions can be expected.
Of the total of 4,300 cases, close to 1,500 (30%) could become acceptors of
family planning services. This is a minimum that can be attained on the
basis of the experience of successful programs. Equally important, the
addition of this new hospital will relieve pressure on other hospitals allowing
an effective postpartum program in these other hospitals. Finally, Mount Hope
Hospital will have the capacity to provide specialized services to women who
require them; such womea could be referred to the hospital by Health Centers.
4.06      In addition to its contribution to family planning efforts, the
hospital is justified in terms of extending the provision of institutional
deliveries. In 1969, there were 9,600 institutional deliveries in St. George
County which had 100 maternity beds. On the basis of 48 deliveries per bed



-11-
per year, available beds should ideally have handled no more than 4,800
deliveries. The actual number was twice as high leading to overcrowding and
a shorter stay in hospital than desirable. The various project components
will add 68 beds to St. George's County -- 60 in the Mount Hope Hospital and
eight in two delivery units to be built in this County (Petit Valley and
Chaguanas). This falls short of present requirements; but in view of the
program's estimated effect in reducing the number of births after 1975 such
an addition is cnnsidered adequate for future requirements.,
4.07      The following table shows that the added facilities will be needed
over the life time of the project.

1985      19,800           8,900                8,000                     48

2000      20,100           9,000                8,100                     48
These estimates show that with (a) 45% of all deliveries occurring in St. George
County, (as in 1969),  (b) 90% of total deliveries occurring in hospitals (the
present proportion is 80%), the 168 beds available in 1975 (100 presently plus
68 provided by the project) will handle an average of 48 deliveries per year
from 1980-2000. This estimate does not allow for the probability of migration
into this County! A country-wide analysis of bed availability and needs would
show a greater need for these facilities since other counties have a far lower
maternity bed to population ratio.
Health Centers and Delivery Units
4.08      Four new health centers will be constructed in Petit Valley, Toco,
Chaguanas, Rio Claro. A new delivery unit with four beds will be attached to
each center. In addition, a delivery unit will be added to the existing health
center at Roxborough. The location of these centers was based on the density
of population, existing health facilities, distance from nearest place where
maternity services were available, age of the existing building, and the
suggestion of the Ministry of Health (Map 2). The provision of such facilities
should encourage women who do not presently deliver in hospitals (28%) to
come to these centers for delivery where they can be motivated in family
planning. In addition,family planning and maternal and child health sessions
will be held in these centers which will be staffed by nurse-midwives and
supporting staff who will provide 24-hour service. About 1,200 annual
deliveries can be expected in the delivery units and this may lead to about
360 new acceptors being motivated every year. Each center will also include
living quarters for two nurse students, so that they can spend one to two
months in the field as part of their public health training.
4.09      In addition, three health centers (without delivery units) where
family planning and maternal and child health sessions will be held will be



-12-
constructed at Freeport, La Romain and Debe. Their location was based on
population density, age and condition of existing facilities, evidence of
utilization of facilities for prenatal care and the suggestion of the
Ministry of Health. In 1973, all the health centers will be serving an
estimated 9,600 women. On the basis of conservative assumptions - two
sessions per week and five acceptors per session - 1,400 women are estimated
to accept family planning services every year.
San Fernando Family Planning Clinic
4.10      The San Fernando Hospital is the second largestmaternity hospital
in the island with 7,800 cases (deliveries and abortions) in 1969. It has a
postpartum program and a family planning clinic which however is located in
an old dilapidated wooden building. New premises with adequate privacy and
patient facilities are needed for offering family planning services. A new
clinic will therefore be constructed on the site of the existing clinic on
the premises of the San Fernando Hospital.
Family Planning Institute
4.11      The Population Council is presently housed in rented quarters
which are inadequate for training, evaluation and administration. New quarters
for this will be constructed near the Port-of-Spain Nursing School and
Hospital. Theee new facilities could also serve as a center that would give
focus to leaders of the medical and nursing profession and on the
importance of family planning. The quarters will include administrative
offices and facilities for in-service training of family planning workers
and general health personnel (private doctors, government health personnel).
Seminars, workshops and lectures would also be organized for opinion leaders
and a permanent display of population and family planning work can be
maintained.
Nursing Education Complex
4.12      Port-of-Spain Nursing School.  This component consists of:
(i)   expanded teaching and supporting facilities to accommodate a student
body of 500 students and improve the quality of education. Present
facilities were designed for only 200 students but in 1970 there were
382 students of which about 200 were receiving classes in the Port-
of-Spain Hospital. The project is estimated to lead to a moderate
expansion in the number of annual students graduating in the country
from about 200 in the period 1965-70 to 23% in 1975-80 and 260 in
1995-2000. It will also provide facilities for teaching about 60
nursing assistants needed to supplement the work of graduate nurses.
At present these assistants receive classes in inadequate quarters
within the hospital.
(ii)  a dormitory building to accommodate 100 additional students to allow
compulsory residence for all first year students. Present living
quarters accommodate only about 160 students and compulsory residence
requirements are only for the first six months. To improve their
training and to develop an attitude of dedication to the nursing
service, all first year students should reside in the school.



-13-
4.13      This expansion is desirabl  for both health and family planning
reasons. On the quantitative side, there is an estimated present deficit of
840 nurses - 1,300 graduate nurses are in Government service while the need
in 1968, as estimated on the basis of a Government survey, was for 2,140
nurses  qual to 20 nurses per 10,000 population).  In addition to this deficit,
there will be additional needs for:
(i)    project facilities; these will require 76 additional nurses -- 56
for Mount Hope Hospital and 20 for the health centers and delivery
units;
(ii)   family planning program-- 165 nurses will be needed for services
and motivation; and
(iii)  replacements due to emigration, retirement and death.
4.14      On this basis total personnel needs are projected to increase from
1,559 graduate nurses and 693 assistants in 1975 to about 2,400 and 860
respectively in the year 2000 (22.5 nurses per 10,000 population). The pro-
ject  is   designed to meet these needs, whereas graduate nurses  would have
been only about 1,900 by the year 2000 in the absence of the project (13
nurses per 10,000 population). Annex 7 shows these projections in detail.
4.15      More important than the quantitative effect is the project's aim at
improving the quality of nursing education and giving more emphasis to family
planning in the basic training of nurses. Part of the technical assistance
component of the project (para. 4.20) is designed for this purpose. This is
particularly important because of the potential motivating role that most
nurses can have - in hospitals, health centers and in the homes. In 1968,
the Government health services reported more than 665,000 nursing consultations
or 65 per 100 persons. Thus nurses see most families during the year and can
be influential in motivating a large number of women in view of the esteem and
respect with which they are held. (Annexes 9 and 10 contain detailed suggest-
ions for improving the in-service and basic training of nurses in family
planning).
Arima Health Center
4.16      The influence of nursing advice is particularly important in the
field of public health. The project is designed to emphasize this by including
a building at Arima for field training and accommodations, supporting
facilities and a classroom for 30 students. This building, adjacent to the
existing hospital and health center facilities, is intended for field training
of nursing students in community health with emphasis on family planning.
Based on a rotation plan nursing students will receive training under super-
vision for 3 months.
Technical Assistance
4.17      The technical assistance component of the project would consist of:
The development of suitable operating procedures for administering
the MCH-family planning program.  The services of a management
advisor in the Ministry of Health would be needed for a six month
period.



- 14 -
4.18      The revision of the existing evaluation system to:
(a)   improve program operations by evaluating particularly (i) the
system to promptly identify drop-outs and follow them up; and
(ii) the integration of family planning with MCH services
(para. 3.23) and its success relative to other methods of
providing family planning services.
(b)   measure thAe effect of the program on the birth rate.  The need
here is to relate acceptors to targets; the latter are now
optimistic because no allowance is made for the rate of con-
tinuation of acceptors. It is also important to evaluate the
effect of the ongoing program on fertility. This may require
undertaking separate surveys. In addition it will require
demographic analysis such as estimating, in particular, age-
specific fertility rates.
To achieve both objectives it will be necessary to analyse the existing data
and recommend appropriate changes in its collection and distribution. The
services of an evaluation advisor attached to the Population Council will be
required for a one-year period. In addition, provision is made for training
a local expert abroad for a one-year period.
4.19      The introduction of family life education in schools. This is
important from a long term point of view, where the constraint may be on the
demand for family planning services; such education will also have an in-
fluence on the male population, not presently reached by face-to-face and
group motivation efforts. The Government is taking steps in this direction
and has agreed to its introduction as soon as possible but not later than
September 1973. It will be necessary to: (a) develop a training program for
teachers; and (b) determine the best curriculum content for various levels of
education. The services of an advisor attached to the Ministry of Education
will be needed for a one year period.
4.20      The strengthening of family planning education in nursing schools
and training of family planning personnel. This is important for changing
the attitudes of the paramedical profession which are critical for long term
success. The non-medical aspects as well as the medical aspects of the
population problem should be emphasized in such training. The services of a
nursing advisor, attached to the Ministry of Health will be required for a
one-year period.
4.21      A manpower utilization study to advise on the most efficient utiliza-
tion of health personnel in clinics and hospitals. This study may provide
evidence to the medical and nursing profession on the need for a revision of
present functions. The services of an expert with supporting staff attached
to the Ministry of Health will be needed for a period of three months.
4.22      The selection of these foreign advisors and experts referred to in
paras. 4.17 to 4.21 and the drawing up of their terms of reference will be
done in consultation and with the approval of the Bank. Preliminary terms of
reference for each advisor appear in Annex 11. It is expected that part of the
cost of these advisors and experts may become available from other external
sources; in this event the allocation for technical assistance would be
correspondingly reduced and the balance available for cost overruns in other
parts of the project. These advisors and experts should ideally be in the
field before January 1972.

4.23      An architect to head a Population Project Section to be created in
the Ministry of Public Works to supervise the design and construction of the
project's physical components (para. 5.01). These services will be needed,
on a full-time basis for the first two years and on a part-time basis for
the remainder of the project implementation period. This architect would
probably be a local architect.
4.24      An external review mission to be undertaken by international
experts appointed by the Government with Bank assistance and approval to
review program progress and recommend the most suitable method of program
expansion.

4.26      Construction costs were based on recent cost experience for similar
units. They range from TT$ 35 (US$ 17.5) per sq ft for Mount Hope Hospital to
TT$ 18 (US$ 9) for health centers. Furniture and equipment costs are based on
current market prices. Professional fees for local firms have been estimated
at12% of construction. The fee for an international architectural consulting
firm has been estimated at 2% of construction costs and 10% of furniture and
equipment costs.  Technical assistance costs are estimates by the Bank staff.
Contingencies were estimated at (a) 5% for physical changes and (b) 7.5% for
price increases. The latter is based on an annual price increase of 3% in
accordance with recent experience. Physical and price contingencies are
similar for local and foreign expenditure. No custom duties have been included
in the calculation of foreign exchange costs.
4.27      The annual operation costs of all project units is estimated at
TT$ 2.7 million (US$ 1.34million, see Annex 13 for the detailed estimates).
The budgeted expenditure for the Ministry of Health in 1969 was TT$ 31 million
but actually expenditures were only TT$ 27 million. Total recurrent costs of
the project units are therefore modest, amounting to about 66% of the unspent
balance of the Ministry of Health.
Financing
4.28      The proposed Bank loan of TT$ 6.0 million (US$ 3.0 million) will cover
the total foreign exchange costs of US$ 2.6 million and US$ 0.4 million for
interest and commitment charges on the Bank loan during construction. The
foreign exchange component for construction, furniture and equipment has been
estimated on the assumption that foreign firms would win all contracts;
should domestic firms win these contracts, the foreign exchange component for
civil works could fall from 51% to about 46%. In view of the small sum involved,
no adjustment in the loan amount would be made to reflect the lower foreign
exchange component under domestic contractors; this would imply Bank financing
of local currency costs equal to about 3% of total project costs. The balance
of TT$ 4.0 million (US$ 2.0 million) in local currency and any cost overruns
will be provided by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago.
V. IMPLEMENTATION AND DISBURSEMENTS
Project Administration
5.01      The administration and coordination of the project's physcial com-
ponents would be the responsibility of the Project Unit established in the
Ministry of Works to supervise the Bank's education project (Loan No. 564-TR-
October 16, 1968). The Unit would be renamed the Project Implementation Unit,
and strengthened so that the Education and Population Projects would be tech-
nically but not administratively separate. A Population Project Section would
be responsible for the technical aspects of the population project and would
be headed by an architect to be appointed with the approval of the Bank.
AMnex 14 shows the organization of the Project Implementation Unit and the
functions of the Unit and the Population Project Section as agreed during
negotiations. The appointment of the architect to head the Population Project
Section is a condition of loan effectiveness.
Project Sites
5.02      The Mount Hope Hospital will be built on Government-owned property



_7-
at present leased to the University of West Indies. The Port-of-Spain
Nursing School will be built on the present site. The Arima Health Center
will be sited on the grounds of the Arima Hospital. Sites for the health
centers and delivery units have all been selected with the exception of
Freeport and Petit Valley where only the location has been agreed. Complete
surveys and description of all sites will be submitted to the Bank. The
Government has provided assurances that it (a) has or will obtain title to
all the project sites by July 1971; and (b) will bear the complete costs of
connecting roads, access, sewers, and piped services as necessary to the
boundary of each site in accordance with a time schadule to be drawn up by
the architectural hospital consultant.
Professional Services and Supervision
5.03      Neither the Ministry of Works nor any single architectural firm
can adequately handle the overall project. The services of an architectural
hospital consultant will be retained to establish proper environmental and
constructional standards for the project and to closely supervise all aspects
of implementation. In addition to preparing schematic and final designs for
all project components, the architectural hospital consultant will advise the
Project Implementation Unit on the appointment of local architectural firms.
It would also advise and offer recommendations during construction. The Gov-
ernment has agreed to retain such a firm on terms and conditions acceptable
to the Bank. The signing of the agreement, together with a detailed schedule
for construction prepared by the consultant and approved by the Bank, is a
condition of loan effectiveness. Local architectural firms (not more than three
in number) will be responsible for working drawings, tender documents, supervi-
sion and execution of the project components. All professional fees will be
determined on a fixed fee basis plus an agreed price escalation and physical
contingency allowance. Project components will be packaged for tendering
according to the recommendations of the architectural hospital consultant.
Contracts and Procurement
5.04      All contracts for the project will be awarded on the basis of
international competitive tendering. It is expected that the local industry
will be awarded most of the civil works contracts with the possible exception
of the Mount Hope Hospital. Some furniture awards are likely to be made
to local firms while the supply and installation of medical equipment is
expected to be awarded to a foreign firm. Domestic manufacturers of
furniture and equipment would be accorded a preferential margin equal to
15% of the cif costs of competing imports or to the existing rate of duty,
whichever is lower.
Disbursements
5.05      The Bank loan of US$ 3.0 million will be disbursed to finance the
foreign exchange costs of the project and interest and commitment charges
during construction. Disbursements by the Bank would be for: (i) the cif
cost of imported equipment and furniture; and (ii) 48% of the cost of
civil works, locally produced furniture, professional fees and technical
assistance. The proposed Project Implementation Schedule covering the



-18-
project period of four years is shown in Annex 15 while the estimated
schedule for disbursement is shown in Annex 16. Undisbursed funds
would be cancelled.
VI. SOCIO-ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
6.01      The Government has recognized the importance of the family planning
program since 1967. The Third Five-Year Plan (1969-73) gives this program the
highest priority on the basis of the high level of chronic unemployment and
the need for added food, housing and educational services for the increasing
population. The project would improve the scale and effectiveness of the
family planning program and provide important social and economic benefits.
Although the economic and social benefits cannot be measured precisely, they
are substantial and can be described in specific terms.
6.02      On the social side, the provision of better maternity services and
fewer pregnancies would improve the health of mothers and children. The
availability and more extensive use of contraception would reduce the number
of unwanted pregnancies which result either in induced abortions under unsafe
conditions (and may lead to death) or in unwanted children. Parents of
smaller families can give greater care to their children, resulting in better
health and lower infant mortality. Among the impoverished sections of the
population, fewer children would mean less malnutrition. Family planning
services would thus lead to an improvement in the quality of life, particuarly
among the low-income sections of the population.
6.03      The family planning program would gradually affect demographic trends;
these changes in turn would have important economic implications. The effect
of the project on overall program performance is estimated to increase new
acceptors from 10,000 in 1970 to over 22,000 per year from 1980 onwards. Of
this total, 7,000 women would become acceptors in maternity hospitals and over
5,000 in the project's health centers and family planning clinics. In addition
10,000 women are estimated to accept services in other facilities partly as a
result of the training and technical assistance components of the project as
well as the general measures that will accompany the project.
6.04      The effects of this increase in acceptances are expected to be as
follows (Annex 17 gives details of the estimated demographic effect of the
project);
(a)   the rate of decline of the birth rate will double -- from 27/1,000
in 1969 to 15.5/1,000 in 1980 instead of 21.5/1,000 without the
project. After 1980, the birth rate is expected to stabilize at
the low level of about 15/1,000;
(b)   the rate of population growth will be reduced -- from about 2.0% in 1970
to 0.9% per year in 1980 instead of 1.5% in the absence of the
project;
(c)   the size of the population would be 21,500 (1.7%) smaller than other-
wise in 1980 and 97,300 (6.2%) smaller than otherwise in the year
2000; and



-19-
(d)   the labor force wo;uld be 14,000 (2.1%) smaller than otherwise in
1995 and 37,000 (5.2%) smaller by the year 2000.
All these results were derived from (1) continuation rates_of 80%, 60%, 40%,
20% and 10% at the end of each year during five years; these are high but
not unrealistic on the basis of reported recent experience and project's
emphasis on the follow-up of acceptors (para. 3.19); and (2) five women
practicing contraception for one year would avert one birth. This corresponds
to the fertility level of non-acceptors.
6.05      The size of the demographic trends discussed in para. 6.04 deter-
mines the economic benefits. In the short-term, living standards will improve
by changing the age structure of the population and thereby reducing the
number of consumers in relation to the labor force. Each child must be fed,
clothed, cared for medically and educated. A smaller number of children means
that the same resources are available to a smaller population. At the family
level, more food and clothing etc. is available to each member of the smaller
family. For the Government, resources that would have been needed to educate
and provide medical services for the additional population are now freed for
other uses. Both Government and family benefits are large in relation to the
costs, which moreover include a large health component from which additional
benefits would be obtained.
6.06      The reduction in the rate of population growth resulting from the
project is estimated to lead to a per capita income that is about 5% higher
than otherwise in 1985. To achieve an equivalent increase in per capita
living standards without a reduction in population would require investment
equal to cover 20% of the national income from 1975-85. This implies large
and unrealistic expectations on the economy's capacity to increase its
savings.
6.07      The project will also help to alleviate the long-term unemployment
problem. The labor force is estimated to be 37,000 smaller than otherwise in
the year 2000 as a result of the project. Perhaps more important, the number
of new entrants into the labor force would be less than half of what they would
be in the absence of the project. If the unemployment rate in 1968 (14%)
remains constant there would be approximately 100,000 unemployed persons in
the year 2000 without the project; the reduction of the labor force by
37,000 would therefore reduce unemployment by more than one-third, a not
inconsiderable contribution to the problem. These are no more than illustrative
figures, but they show that the long-term effect of the project on the labor
force and unemployment should be substantial.
6.08      In summary, the project will improve the conditions under which
deliveries are petformed and make for a more effective family planning program.
Such a program will have important social benefits, consisting of improvements
in the health and welfare of mothers and children. It will also lead to better
living standards and will help alleviate the long-run unemployment problem.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, assurances have been obtained from the Government
on the following points:
(1)   the Ministry of Health shall appoint an additional PMO to relieve



-20-
the present PMO-IS of some of her present duties to enable
her to devote principal efforts to the MCH and family planning
program (para. 3.18);
(2)   the Bank's comments will be taken into account in the selection
of an official to the post of the present PMO-IS (para. 3.18);
(3)   the present system of bonding of civil servants shall be
extended to cover nurses (para. 3.20);
(4)   adequate iueasure shall be taken to ensure that nurse-midwives
shall be allowed to examine patients to supply contraceptives
(other than IUD) and refer only cases with complications to
doctors (para. 3.21);
(5)   the scheme of Family Planning Aide Project, if found success-
ful, shall be extended or an alternative shall be adopted by
the Government by March 1972, in consultation with the Bank,
to motivate women who do not deliver in hospitals (para. 3.22);
(6)   the pilot project to integrate family planning and health ser-
vices shall be introduced by July 1971 in three health centers
and, if found successful, shall be extended to other health
centers in consultation with the Bank (para. 3.23);
(7)   the pediatric unit in the San Fernando Hospital planned by the
Government shall be built in accordance with a timetable agreed
to during negotiations (para. 3.19);
(8)   a family life education advisor shall be supplied to ensure
that the Government's desire to introduce such education in
schools by September 1973 is met (para. 4.18);
(9)   the Government will possess title to all sites by July 1971 and
will provide funds to meet the full cost of connecting roads,
sewers and piped services to the boundaries of each site (para. 5.02);
(10)   the selection of the architect to head the Population Project
Section of the Project Implementation Unit (paras. 4.23 and 5.01).
7.02 Conditions of Loan Effectiveness.
(1)   The contract between the architectural hospital consultant and the
Government will be signed (para. 5.03);
(2)   The head of the Population Project Section acceptable to the Bank
will be appointed (para. 5.01);
(3)   The additional PMO to relieve the PMO-IS of some of her present
duties will be appointed (para. 3.18).
7.03      Subject to the assurances described above, the proposed project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$ 3.0 million equivalent to the Government of
Trinidad and Tobago equal to about 66% of total project costs and 60% of
project financial requirements. The loan would be for a period of 25 years
including a 10 year grace period.

ANNEX 1
Page 1 of 6 pages
RECENT POPULATION TRENDS
The population of Trinidad and Tobago was 275,000 in 1901 and doubled
in 46 years. The total population in 1968 was 1.02 million (Table 1). During
the last 20 years (1948-68) the rate of natural increase varied between 2 to
3% per year (Table 2). The birth rate varied around 38/1,000 for most of the
1948-62 period with a general fertility rate of 189 (Table 2). It declined by
6-9% per year from 1962 to 1967 excluding 1963-64. As a result the birth
rate was 28/1,000 in 1967. Since then the decline in birth rate as well as
general fertility rate was slower as the decline was only 2% during these years.
No firm estimates of birth rate for 1969 are available but by all indications
the birth rate would have been around 27.0. This estimate is derived from the
number of births in the hospitals that constitute 62 to 64% of the total births.
In 1969, the birth rate was estimated to be 27.0 per thousand. For 1970 the
number of births was available only up to September. Due to seasonality in
births in Trinidad and Tobago no estimates could be made on that basis. But
the number of births was around 12,000 up to that time.
The above trends in the birth rate reflect genuine decline in fertility
and are not the result of changes in the age structure. This can be seen from
the trends in several refined measures of fertility. Age specific fertility
rates -- or the number of births per 1,000 women of various ages - have all
declined between 1960-68, though this decline has recently slowed down (Table 3).
Similarly, the general fertility rate - or the number of births per 1,000
women aged 15-44 - declined from 181 in 1962 to 134.7 in 1968. Finally, the
gross reproduction rate - or the number of girls born per woman over her
reproductive life (35 years) has decreased from 2.6 to 1.9 over the same period.
The rate of growth of population including net migration was more than
3% in 1960-63. More than 2,000 persons immigrated in 1962 and 1963. However,
this trend was reversed into emigration since 1964. In 1967 and 1968 about
9,000 persons emigrated every year. The rate of growth of population was con-
sequently reduced to 1.7% in 1968.
As a result of the past high fertility levels, the age structure of
the population is unfavorable with more than 42% of the population aged less
than 15 years. The decline in fertility has been comparatively recent to
improve the age structure.   The dependency, ratio or children under 15 years of
age per person of 15-59 years has, therefore, been high and equal to 0.81.
Table 4 shows the age structure between 1960 and 1968. Table 5 gives the
regional distribution of the population; it shows that 45% of the population
lives in St. George's County.

NATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING EFFORTS
Targets
1.        In the initial years, the five year National Family Planning Program
(1967-72) aimed to reach ten percent of women aged 15-44 every year. The
annual targets of new acceptors of 1968 and 1969 were set at 20,000. The pro-
gram, therefore, tried to reach about 100,000 women over a five year period.
The goal of the Government is to reduce the birth rate to below 20/1,000 by
1977.
Achievements
2.        The number of new acceptors was less than 4,000 in 1967.  But in 1968
the National Family Planning Program recruited about 13,000 new acceptors and
during 1969 aboutl6,oOo joined the program. In 1970 the achievements have
fallen short of targets as only 5,067 acceptors were recruited by the Government
program and another 4,153 by the FPA and 149 by CMAC resulting in a total of
9,369. Tables 1 and 2 show the number of acceptors in Government and FPA
clinics.
Family Planning Sessions
3.        Nineteen Government family planning clinics were in operation in 1969
with more than 30 sessions per week. In addition FPA operated eight clinics
during the year. The eight FPA clinics had 4,210 sessions for the year while
CMAC clinics held 450 sessions.
4.        In 1970 nine more clinics were added by the Government with one
session per week in each, bringing the total number of sessions to more than
39. Table 3 relates acceptors to the number of sessions and indicates that
the workload in 1970 was 31.1 visits per session and 54.3 per doctor session.
Family Planning Personnel
5.        Personnel working in the family planning program in 1970 is shown
in Table 4. The number of posts and doctors and nurses in position in 1970
is shown in Table 5 and 6 respectively.
Methods
6.        In 1969, 75% of acceptors chose the pill, 4% the IUD and 21% other
methods. The acceptance pattern has changed again. In 1970 60.6% of the
new acceptors selected pills, 5.6% the IUD and 33.8%other methods like condom
and jelly etc.

ANNEX 4
Page 1 of 2 pages
EMIGRATION OF NURSES AID DOCTORS
A. Nurses
Nurses migrate from Trinidad and Tobago to find employment in
countries with nursing shortages in particular the United Kingdom, Canada
and the U.S. The reasons for this are the greater employment opportunities
and financial rewards abroad; moreover local conditions of excessive work,
inadequate staffing and poor promotion prospects do not encourage new
graduates to remain in the service.
Measures to Counteract Emigration of Nurses.  The Government is aware of
the present problem which can be met at three levels:
(i)  Improving conditions in Trinidad, which is one objective of the
project's technical assistance component. Examples of measures
to be considered here are:
(a) Revision of the criteria for promotions to give more emphasis
to official qualifications, merit and experience and less to
length of service;
(b)  Effective utilization of professional nurses through such
measures as increasing the establishments of Nursing
Assistants so that less complex nursing duties could be under-
taken by them;  the provision of clerical assistance to
nurses; and the provision of adequate supplies and equipment.
(ii)  At the same time as improving conditions of nurses an effective
system of bonding nurses, as practised in other fields in Govern-
ment service could be effectively extended to the nursing
profession. According to the system all persons to whom training
awards (free training, fellowship or scholarship) are made by the
Government are required to serve the Government at the end of
their award for period based on the length of their courses as
follows:
Length of Training                              Period of Service
Six months or less                                 1 year
Over six months but not
more than 24 months                                3 years
Over 24 months                                     5 years
In lieu of the above period of service the trainee has to pay back
the money given in the form of award (along with interest due on it).
The amount to be paid declines with the increase in period served.
The existing system of bonding of nurses is not very effective as
they have to pay only TT$ 500 in lieu of two years of service for
which they are bonded. The Government will introduce a system of
bonding of nurses for the period of three years.  A one year intern-
ship may also be introduced, and would be included in the three-year
period. The proposed bond would be TT$ 3,000. This system would be
similar to that proposed for the civil service, as the bonding period
for the length of training of over 24 months will be reduced to 3 years.



ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 2 pages
(iii) Finally serious consideration should be given to the introduction
of a one year period of intership at the end of the three year
basic training course for nurses. To implement this the Nursing
Council will have to decide that internship is a pre-requisite
for full registration.
B. Doctors
The Ministry of Health contemplates a number of measures to broaden
the availability of medical practitioners in the country. The Government
proposes to broaden the medical registration ordinance to allow Trinidadian
nationals trained abroad in recognized medical schools in non-commonwealth
countries to practice. At present full medical registration is restricted
to commonwealth trained doctors.
Measures to improve service conditions are being explored. This
will include the payment of special on-call and non-practising allowances,
the offer of short-term contracts for doctors with enhanced terminal con-
tractual benefits, and the employment of private practitioners seasonally
in areas where there are insufficient Government doctors. Promotion
opportunities in the service would also be improved by the creation of
additional senior positions and a new intermediate promotional grades.

DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT MEDICAL FACILITIES
A. Mount Hope Hospital
1.       The hospital is intended to provide (a) maternity services including
facilities for postpartum and post-abortion education and (b) teaching
facilities for obstetrics-gynecology and nursing-midwifery. It would consist
of the following sections
(i)        administration including waiting rooms and office for
administrative staff;
(ii)       outpatient department including a clinic for antenatal and
family planning services;
(iii)      adjunct diagnostic facilities;
(iv)       inpatient department with 10 antenatal beds and a demonstration
classroom with 30 seats;
(v)        labor and delivery suite, the former including a demonstration
classroom and lounge for trainees;
(vi)       space for 50 postpartum beds with demonstration classroom and
other facilities;
(vii)      nursery;
(viii)     40 gynecological and obstetric beds with a demonstration class-
room;
(ix)       teaching staff offices;
(x)        service facilities;
(xi)       offices for family planning officer, nurse educator and health
visitor, and 30 seat health demonstration classroom;
(xii)      public facilities.
The total gross floor area would be about 73,000 sq ft and the net area would
be 46,000 sq ft. The hospital would be located to the northwest of the
University of West Indies. The land is owned by the Government, but it was
lent to the University. The area provided for the hospital at present is 10
acres with the assurance that additional area would be made available if
required.
1/ A description of the Port-of-Spain Nursing School and the Arima
Health Center is given in Annex 7.



ANNEX 5

B. Health Centers
2.       Family planning services will be held in three new health centers.
The space program of these health centers would be of the same type as
existing type III centers. It would provide for a public waiting room,
examination room for patients, dispensary, doctor's office, staff room and
space for toilet, stores etc. The location of these centers would be at
La Romain,Freeport and Debe. La Romain does not have a center at present
and, therefore, a new site has to be identified by the Government. The
existing structure in Freeport is in poor condition and is rented. The
Government, therefore, has to find a new site for the proposed building.
The present state of the building at Debe is also in poor condition and
would be replaced. The new building would be on the same site. Each of
these health centers would have a gross floor area of more than 2,500 sq ft
and a net area of around 2,000 sq ft.
C. Health Centers with Delivery Units
3.       These are intended to provide (i) conditions for an effective post-
partum program; (ii) general health and family planning services; and
(iii) on-the-job training for nurses. A delivery unit will be added to the
existing type III health centers. This unit consists of four beds for normal
delivery cases, one labor and delivery suite, a nurse's station, and living
quarters for one nurse along with rooms for other services. The gross area
of the delivery unit would be 1,500 sq ft with a net area of more than
1,000 sq ft. When the health center is also included, the gross area would
be around 5,500 sq ft and the net area 3,000 sq ft. The health centers and
the delivery units will be built in Toco, Petit Valley, Rio Claro and
Chaguanas. In Roxborough the present health center is in good condition and
only the addition of a delivery unit will be necessary. In Toco and
Chaguanas the present site is too small and an extension of the present site
must be added. There is no center in Petit Valey and therefore the Government
has to identify a new site. The center at Rio Claro is in poor condition and
has, to be rebuilt on the same site.
D. Family Planning Institute
4.       The Institute is to provide facilities for (i) administration;  and
(ii) training. It would consist of one conference room for 15 persons, a
30 seat classroom, a family planning library, a doctor's office, five staff
offices and other facilities. The Institute will be located on the campus of
the Port-of-Spain Nursing School. Total gross area is 4,800 sq ft with a net
area of 3,400 sq ft.

UTILIZATION OF HOSPITAL BEDS
1.       In 1969, Trinidad had 222 maternity beds for normal deliveries, 52
antenatal and 71 gynecological and 55 abortion beds. In the same year there
were 18,045 deliveries and 5,337 abortions. There were 79 deliveries per
maternity bed and 87 abortions per abortion bed. This meant a stay of less
than four days per delivery on the average, after allowing for change-over
and seasonal effects. This average does not reveal the overcrowding in
individual hospitals. For example, there were 136 deliveries per bed
San Fernando Hospital and 89 deliveries per bed in the Port-of-Spain Hospital.
Table 1 shows the overall shortage of beds in Trinidad using the desirable
norm of 48 deliveries per bed per year. On this basis existing beds are
sufficient to handle only 10,656 cases; this gives a current shortage of
158 beds for the balance of 7,906 deliveries. Nearly one half of this short-
age was concentrated in the Port-of-Spain Hospital.
The above averages do not reflect actual overcrowding in hospitals
due to the seasonality of births and the long stay of women with complica-
tions.which tends to increase average stay. For example, Table 2 shows
that in the Port-of-Spain Hospital the average length of stay for women with
normal deliveries was 1.5 days whereas for caesarian sections and deliveries
with forceps the average stay was 9 and 5 days respectively.

NURSING REQUIR]MEFNT,
Ob; ective
1.       Nursing personnel is essential to carry out the family planning
activities necessary to attain the goals set by the Government in this field.
Present availability of that personnel is not enough to cover the health and
family planning needs; therefore, attention will have to be given in the
project to training. The extension of the Port-of-Spain Nursing School, and
the construction of facilities for a Community Health Training Center in
Arima are the components of the project intended for training nursing personnel
in sufficient numbers and within an environment which will allow for improved
quality of teaching and increased dedication to training on family planning.
This Annex considers the future supply and requirements of nursing personnel
in the light of past trends and a description of project facilities designed
to meet future needs.
Past Trends
2.       Between 1965 and 1970 the nursing schools of the country were turning
out graduates just in sufficient numbers to maintain the ratio of professional
nurses to population, at 13 per 10,000 (see Table 1). In 1965, 56 percent
of the new graduates were replacements for attritions due to death, retirement
or resignation. By 1970, almost 80 percent of the anntual number of graduates
were to replace attritions. A large proportion of attritions was due to
emigrations and resignations. A system of bonding is being proposed
by the Ministry of Health to alleviate this problem.
3.       In order to meet the quantitative demand for nursing services at
minimum increase in cost, a one year course program for training nursing
assistants was initiated in September 1967 with the aid of UNICEF. This
personnel is non-professional and is supposed to perform simple nursing
functions. Up to October 1970, 126 auxiliaries had qualified for enrollment
with the Nursing Council and 116 had passed examinations and were undergoing
internship. During 1968-70 around 150 trainees were admitted annually.
Nursing Personnel Needs
4.       The shortage of nurses in the country has been estimated taking into
account the volume of patients attended in hospitals and in outpatlent health
establishments and the nursing hours devoted to these patients. In 1968 there
were approximately 1,300 active graduate nurses in government service (13 per
10,000 population). Yet, the minimum number which would have been needed,
according to estimates presented in Table 2 is 2,140 graduate nurses (21 per
10,000).
5.       Furthermore, the provision of nursing time for the new maternity
hospital at Mount Hope and for the health centers and delivery units in the
project has to be taken into account. The new facilities, with 120 additional
maternity beds, will require the work of 76 additional nurses (of which 56
nurses would be needed for Mount Hope Hospital).
l/ To estimate the supply and requirements of nurses in this Annex, use has
been made of a nursing model developed in the Population Projects
Department.



ANNEX 7
Page 2 of 13 pages
6.       Additional nursing personnel for family planning motivation and
services (new acceptors and continuation of those women already in the program)
may be estimated at 1.5 per 10,000 population. This estimate is based on the
assumption that by 1975 there will be approximately 22,000 new acceptors per
year and 166,000 visits requiring 253,000 nurse-hours for family
planning (1 5 nurse-years or approximately 1.5 graduate nurse per 10,000
population.T; of this number, 21 nurse-years will be used for postpartum
motivation).
7.       Table 3 includes estimates of nursing personnel needs (both graduate
nurses and nursing assistants) with a breakdown by type. Basic nurses are
those that have completed the 3-year course in nursing schools of the country.
Nurse-midwives are those nurses graduated from the basic course who have
approved one-year course on midwifery. Public health nurses have an additional
one-year training after completing midwifery studies. Nursing assistants are
trained in a one-year course and perform simple nursing functions. They con-
stitute a non-professional category. The required numbers in the table have
been derived by considering that by 1980 an overall ratio of 22.5 per 10,000
population for nurses and assistants would cover the deficit observed in 1968
(see Table 2).
8.       Table 4 gives an indication of the additional professional nursing
personnel that would be required for the new proposed project. The estimate
presented in that table, of 97 nurses needed for the project, may be con-
sidered as a minimum additional number. It comprises 56 nurses for Mount Hope,
20 for health centers with delivery units and 21 for family planning motivation.
Column 6 of Table 4 indicates that during the period 1975-2000 an average of
250 nurses will have to be incorporated yearly to the nursing manpower in
order to replace attritions and maintain the ratio at the desired level of
16.5 per 1000 population. Five percent of this yearly replacement will be
needed for the additional facilities created by the proposed project. This
does not make allowance, however, for more personnel to serve an increased
demand for family planning services in facilities other than those built by
the project, which may originate from motivation activities inherent to the
proposed project.
9.       In order to achieve an overall personnel ratio  of 22.5 per 10,000
population by 1980, training throughout the country would have to proceed as
indicated in Table 5. Admissions needed and graduates have been calculated
using a model that takes into account the assumptions indicated under each
table. Attrition and dropout rates have been determined on the basis of
actual data for recent years and on expectations of improvements in dropout
rates formulated by Government officials.
1/ The following assumptions are also used:
(a)  Number of working hours per nurse, per year: 1531
(b)  Nurse-time for new postpartum acceptors will amount to 15 minutes
for motivation before leaving hospital, one hour for home visit
one week before the appointment for family planning is due and
15 minutes for first visit to clinic, plus 2 additional visits
(15 minutes each) during first year.
(c) Each o:ld acceptor will have 5 visitg per year, requiring an
estimated 15 minutes nurse-time.



ANNEX 7
Page 3 of 13 pages
10.      In 1970 the nursing schools admitted 187 new students for graduate
courses and 146 for nursing assistant courses. The estimates of Tables 3
and 5, which reflect the basic needs of the country for nursing personnel to
man the health and family planning services, indicate that by 1975 220 students
for graduate studiesand 121 students for nursing assistant courses would have
to be admitted in order to produce a yearly output of 182 professional nurses
and 156 nursing assistants to replace attritions and build up the ratio of
professional personnel to population from 13 per 10,000 in 1970 to 16.5 by
1980; also, the ratio of nursing assistants to pppulation would have to
increase from 2.1 per 10,000 (or 242 nursing assistants with requisites com-
pleted in 1970) to 6.0 by 1980.
11.      The previous discussions indicates that in order to carry out
activities in family planning conducive to obtain an adequate level of
acceptors, it is necessary to increase the training of nursing personnel.
With the project, the need for yearly personnel replacement will increase by
27-30 percent (see Table 3, Cols. 5 and 7). The proposed project contains,
as a main component, the expansion of the Port-of-Spain Nursing School with
a view to meet the needs for increased number of nurses and auxiliaries.
Physical Facilities
12.      This section presents a description of the physical facilities result-
ing from extension of the present Port-of-Spain Nursing School and a building
in Arima to be known as Community Health Training Center (CHTC) for field
training of basic, auxiliary and graduate students in domiciliary nursing
and community health. The location of the CHTC in a rural environment would
widen the scope for experimenting in health education. Family centered health
services embracing all aspects of family planning is envisaged to become the
main theme in programming the activities of this center.
13.      The expansion of the Port-of-Spain Nursing School consists of adding
18,450 gross sq ft for teaching facilities to the existing building (7,800
gross sq ft) constructed in 1961 which was designed for an enrollement of
approximately 200 students and now accommodates 382. The present building
consists of 1 classroom with 60 chairs, another with 40 chairs, a library with
16 seats, one demonstration room with 4 beds and small storage space in one
corner. The school has very inadequate toilet facilities (1 toilet for female
students, 1 for males and 2 for staff). There is also one office for teaching
staff and one office for secretarial staff.
14.      Close to 200 students (90 in midwifery, 18 in public health nursing,
15 in nursing education and 60 nursing assistant trainees) are currently
receiving classes elsewhere.
15.      The proposed additions to the present facilities would provide a total
area of 26,250 gross sq ft for the school, designed to include:
2 100-seat classrooms
1 50-seat classroom
1 30 seat biology laboratory
1 demonstration classroom subdivided into 4 teaching spaces
1 library room (70-seat spaces with tables) transformable into
a lecture auditorium, 300 seats.



ANNEX 7
Page 4 of 13 pages
For the teaching and administrative staff the new building would provide an
office for the director, waiting room, clerk's space (400 sq ft), supply
storage, 30-seat conference room, janitor's room, 4 offices for department
heads, 2 offices for librarians, 4 offices for senior staff and 4 offices
for work and conference for junior instructors, plus reception area, storage
and toilet facilities.
16.      In addition to teaching quarters and administration offices the com-
plex includes a 100-single bedroom dormitory to increase the present living
quarters capacity to a total of 250 students. The existing dormitory has
246 bedrooms, of which only 158 are being used as bedrooms for students. The
rest is used for offices, stafL quarters, laundry and storage. For reasons
of habit and attitude formation, all first year students should be encouraged
to live in the school dormitory. Restricted by the shortage of the hostel
accommodation, a proposed nursing education plan prepared by the Ministry of
Health in 1970 stipulates a residence requirement only for the first six
months after which period residence in dorihitories becomes voluntary. The
increased dormitory capacity will afford the length of compulsory residency
to be extended to the desired one year. A construction of 9,375 sq ft for
dining and kitchen facilities is included to provide a seating capacity of
500.
17.      Assuming that by 1985 the country will need about 2,118 graduate
nurses (930 basic nurses, 1,027 nurse-midwives and 161 public health nurses
according to estimates presented in Table 5, parts b, c, d) and also it will
require the services of 770 nursing assistants (Table 5, part 3) in the
coming years the school capacity for nurse and auxiliary training in the
whole country should expand to contain a student body of approximately 880
(peak enrollment estimated for 1980). Present facilities at Port-of-Spain
School were designed for 250 studetts and in 1970 San Fernando was function-
ing with a student body of 300. The additional nursing school facilities
proposed by this project are clearly needed if the goals set for nursing
coverage to the population, for health and family planning, are to be met in
the next ten to fifteen years.
18.      The proposed additions to the school not only would provide suitable
capacity for a student body of 400-500, but also would allow for improvements
in the quality of teaching and for the inclusion of family planning training
for students and active nurses throughout the country.
19.      As part of the nursing education complex the project includes the
construction of a building in Arima, adjacent to the existing hospi'tal and
health center facilities. Based on a rotation plan developed in advance,
students from both nursing schools (San Fernando and Port-of-Spain) and the
nurses attending specialization and continuing education courses will receive
field training here under supervision. The building is planned to house 30
students in 15 double rooms. Kitchen and dining facilities are also contem-
plated. For academic activities a multi-purpose room with capacity for 30
seats has been included in the plans.
20.      The cultural diversity of the people inhabiting this area would pro-
vide a wide range for experimentation on family centered health services and
on the conveyance of family planning information and services to the
population.

EVALUATION OF FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAM
1.        The evaluation system of Trinidad and Tobago should ideally
(a) determine the number of acceptors (and their characteristics) needed to
achieve the required reduction in fertility; (b) review promptly actual
performance in relation to these targets; (c) determine the extent of family
planning practice within and outside the program; (d) measure the continuation
rate of acceptors; (e) develop a system to identify and follow up acceptors
who have left the program; and (f) assess the effectiveness and adequacy of
program inputs such as manpower, contraceptive supplies, training, education
and motivation.
2.         The present system attempts to meet some of the above requirements.
Clinic case cards, clinic registers and research studies in progress are
capable of yielding useful information. The organization of the system is as
follows: at each clinic, records are kept in two forms; (i) clinic cards and
(ii) clinic registers. Each clinic has three types of cards, viz; (a clinic
case card made out for each new person containing information on socio-
economic and demographic characteristics; (b) a transfer slip prepared for a
person going to another clinic; and (c) a statistical card for each new case
providing information on age, geographical location, number of living child-
ren and contraceptive methods used. The statistical cards are returned to
the Central Office at the end of the month for analysis of new acceptors. The
clinic registers consist of (a) the daily register which contains records of
daily attendance at each clinic session, new cases by contraceptive method,
old cases, and revisits; (b) the follow-up register gives the total number of
new acceptors by method of contraception and the continuation record for each
individual for a period of three months.
3.         A monthly report form is completed each month by the clinics to give
information on its performance. The report forms are seat to the Central Office
with duplicates to the Regional Office. It is then compiled by the Central
Office to give a summary of the clinic monthly reports.
4.         The following studies are under progress:  (i) field survey of
knowledge, attitude and practice of family planning; (ii) follow-up of a
sample clinic dropouts; and (iii) evaluation of postpartum motivation efforts.
5.         The following elaborates some of the aspects discussed in the text
(para. 4.17).
(a)     For the effective follow-up of dropouts two types of cards could
be tried:
(i) Referral Form. For follow-up of postpartum and postabortion
acceptors, a referral form has to be introduced at each
hospital. The form must include only the name, address, date
of delivery or abortion, the name of the clinic nearest to
patient's home and a date for a family planning visit. One
copy of this form should be retained by the patient and the
other sent to the receiving clinic where they could be filed
by date or week. The clinic should periodically check the
file to obtain names and addresses of individuals who do not



ANNEX 8
Page 2 of 3 pages
come to clinic. A proforma of such form is attached at the
end of this Annex.
(ii) Control Card. It is suggested that the follow up register now
in use be discontinued and a card file be designed to replace
it. Cards should include identifying information such as
date of visit, change in method (if any), contraceptives
supplied and date of next appointment. Cards should be
filed by the months during which a return appointment or a
renewal of supplies is scheduled. As patients return for
service, the clerk should enter the new information on the
card and refile it under the month of the new return date.
At the end of each clinic session, the clerk should make a
list of patients who missed their appointments. This informa-
tion would then provide the basis on which home visits could
be systematically and effectively conducted. When such a
home visit is completed the nurse or other individual should
make a brief entry on the card either stating a new appoint-
ment date to replace the one missed or giving information
regarding the disposition of the case (transfer, closed, etc.)
A sample form is attached at the end of this Annex.
(b)     Regular periodic surveys of knowledge, attitude and practice may
also be conducted to access the effectiveness of training, mass
communication, motivation and education programs on family
planning acceptances.

TRAINING IN FAMILY PLANNING
Present Facilities
1.       Training activities related to the family planning program have been
provided through individual instruction, in service sessions, workshops, and
seminars. Clinics at Port-of-Spain and San Fernando General Hospital and
clinical facilities of the Family Planning Association are used both for pro-
vision of clinical instruction and for training in clinic organization.
2.       Individual and small group training is done on an ad hoc basis as
the need arises. For example, private practitioners desiring training in
clinical techniques or government physicians newly involved in family planning
activities may receive instruction at any of the above named facilities.
3.       The program has collaborated with the Trinidad and Tobago Medical
Association in providing lectures for meetings of the Association. With the
assistance of PAHO, the Association and the Government sponsored a one-day
session attended by 114 physician's medical students and nurse educators.
4.       Short courses and brief workshops have also been held for health
educators, community development workers and clerical personnel.
5.       One problem with the training program has been the difficulty of
obtaining participation in courses lasting more than a few days.  Most of the
professional personnel in the program have difficulty in finding time to
break away from other government duties or from private practice in order to
participate in training courses of longer duration.
6.       Selected participants have received training overseas through fellow-
ships offered by international institutions such as the Ford Foundation, PAHO,
SIDA, etc.
7.       Of longer term significance is the revision of the basic nursing
curriculum to include family planning elements which is described separately.
There has also been some movement in this direction in medical education,
e.g. the inclusion of 10 hours of instruction in population dynamics and
family planning in the Department of Social and Preventive Medicine of the
University of the West Indies Medical School. During the last year of the
medical curriculum, some instruction is provided for students in the Port-
of-Spain General Hospital.
Proposed Program
8.       The exigencies of implementing an active family planning program have
demanded that the bulk of training to date be of a specific job or task
oriented nature. The need for this type of training will, of course, continue
as new clinics are opened and new activities are developed. There will also
be a need for continued up-dating of previously trained individuals as new
techniques and procedures are developed. Given the pressure of other duties,
many of the personnel of the program will have to be trained in a continuing
series of short courses and workshops.



ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 2 pages
9.       It appears there will also be a need for further development of the
short course program to emphasize topics such as research and evaluation,
health education and motivation, training methods, family life education,
etc. Technical assistance may be required for development of prototype
courses.
10.      In view of the history of the development of family planning program
and the present desire on the part of the Ministry of Health to integrate
family planning into other health services, particularly those in maternal
and child health, there is a need to include family planning elements in all
training and orientation programs of the Ministry. This will be particularly
necessary if targets of the recently formulated Maternal and Pre-School Child
Health Program are to be reached. Personnel engaged in work in hospital
maternity wards, did not appear to feel responsibility toward patient educa-
tion in family planning. If such feelings are at all widespread, both
maternal and child health and family planning programs will suffer. It is
suggested that opportunities be sought in all suitable training situations
to stress the relationships between family planning and other health
activities.

REORGANIZATION OF THE BASIC NURSING CURRICULUM
TO INCORPORATE FAMILY PLANNING EDUCATION
1.        To ensure that all nurses graduating from the basic schools
of nursing are adequately equipped to make effective contributions to
the Family Planning activities in the country, careful restructuring
and revision of the present curriculum need to be effected.
2.        Since the management of course contents in breadth and depth
is dependent upon the teaching staff of the schools of nursing, it is
essential that they share a common understanding of the needs, the
value and the role of the nurse in Family Planning. In general terms,
the fundamental concepts meriting attention are that:
a)   Family Planning is an effective means of enhancing the
quality of life. Information concerning its principles
and practice should therefore be disseminated to all who
need it;
b)   The nurse, being a member of the health professions, and
a better informed element of the citizenry, has a mission
to promote Family Planning;
c)   Conversion of students to these beliefs is the responsibility
of every teacher in the school on whose conduct shall depend
the success of the undertaking; and, that
d) Family Planning is of prime importance in an individual's life,
for decisions and actions taken today may yield far-reaching
benefits in the future. For a nursing student, an early
awareness of this importance enhances his/her chance of com-
pleting the course of study without interruption; of becoming
a responsible parent and effective nurse able to contribute
positively to the health and welfare of his/her family,
patients and the comunuity.
J.        The objectives to be attained by the Family Planning components
of the curriculum should aim at motivating the students to:
a)   Postponement of marriage and prevention of parenthood until
after completion of studentship;
b)   Comprehension of relationships between family size and the
economic wellbeing, health and welfare of the individual and
the family;



ANNEX 1 0
Page 2 of 9pages
c)   Appreciation of the significance of population growth
and its impact on social change, health service and
national economic development;
d)   Understanding of the policies and aims of the Population
Council and the services provided by the Family Planning
Program;
0)   Acquisition of an up-to-date knowledge in the process,
methods and techniques of contraception;
f)   Adoption of a positive attitude toward the practice and
teaching of Family Planning;
and in their development of skills in:
g)   Identifying the patients' needs for Family Planning;
h)   Motivating and influencing individuals in the adoption of
a healthy attitude towards Family Planning;
i)  Conducting group teaching in Family Planning to men,
women, adolescents and children;
j)   The management of family planning services including
referral, follow-up and clinic procedures; and in
k)   The utilization of every opportunity to impart appropriate
infomnation on Family Planning.
4^.       Review of the syllabus24 Regulations   and the current thinking/-
of the Nursing Council of Trinidad and Tobago leaves the impression that
incorporation of the Family Planning contents as outlined below will be
well within the competency of the School of Nursing Administration.

E.  Effect on the Labor Force
The demographic effect results from gbe newe acceptors motivated in
the project facilities as well as 4.r -ovemens in overall performance as a
result of the technical assistance component of the project along with the
measures accompanying the project. These acceptors avert a number of births
which affect fertility rates, popuilation size, age-structure and the labor
force.  All these effects are estimated in this Annex.  The estimates of
births averted and hence reduction in birth rate are only indicative of
possible achievements. The actual achievement would, however, depend on
the level of fertility at the time the groject starts operation, the
socio-demographic composition of acceptors, methods used and their continua-
tion rates. Since there are no firm estimates available for either of these
components the assumptions made in the following analysis are tentative and
the technique of estimation is simple. It is essential, therefore, to
check the divergence between actual experience and these assumptions over
the project period through continuous evaluation.
A. Number of New Acceptors
The new acceptors are estimated to increase (i) from the expansion
of the postpartum motivation program in all hospitals and delivery units;
(ii) by family planning sessions in project health centers; and (iii) by
improving performance in existing facilities as a result of organizational
changes and technical assistance. In the following sections the sum of (i)
and (ii) is called the "project effect" (Projection I) and the total of all
acceptors (including (iii) i.e. those in existing facilities) is termed the
"project and program effect" (Projection II).
(i) Acceptors in the Postpartum Program
The success of the postpartum motivation depends on the number of
women delivering in hospital and on the availability of sufficient time to
motivate and educate these women. The addition of 80 delivery beds (60 at
Mount Hope Hospital and 20 in the delivery units) through the proposed project
should relieve pressure in all hospitals and thereby increase the duration of
stay in these hospitals, and also increase the proportion of deliveries



ANNEX 17
Page 2 of 11 pages
occurring in hospitals. The number of acceptors in the postpartum program is
estimated as follows:
(a)    the proportion of women delivering in hospitals is expected to
increase from the present 65% to 85% by 1980 and to remain constant
thereafter; and
(b)    30% of recently delivered mothers are expected to accept family
planning services. A recent survey indicates that this proportion
is currently 12% in the two largest hospitals. However, the post-
partum program is expected to improve this because of a larger
number of adequately trained nurses for education and motivation;
and because cases will be followed up at home within six weeks of
discharge. The experience of other successful postpartum programs
indicates that 30% is reasonable and, in the case of the most
successful programs, has greatly exceeded this figure.
On the basis of the above, the number of acceptors between 1975 and 1985 is
as follows:

constant for the period.
2/ Abortions and miscarriages were 30% of the live births in hospitals in
1969. The proportion is kept constant.
(ii) Acceptors in the Project Health Centers
Five health centers with delivery units, three health centers with-
out delivery units and two family planning clinics in San Fernando and Mount
Hope Hospitals are included in the project. The number of family planning
sessions to be held at these clinics and the number of acceptors have been
determined on the basis of actual experience in the country which is summarized
in the following table.

Up to September, 1970, the actual number reported is 1,544.
On the basis of experience in the last two years it is expected that (i) the
average number of sessions would be around 2 per new clinic and (ii) the
number of new acceptors would be at least 5 per session. The number of sessions
to be held per week in each clinic separately is also related to the size of
the female population served by them as indicated in the following table.

All these units except Mount Hope Hospital would be ready in 1972. The new
acceptors motivated through these facilities would be 4,800 in 1973 and 1974.
About 480 acceptors in 1975 would be added in the Mount Hope Hospital Clinic
bringing the total to 5,280 acceptors per year.
(iii) Acceptors in Existing Facilities
As a result of a large availability of nurses, better organization
and technical assistance the existing facilities would also improve in perfor-
mance. Due to their dispersal and larger number, these facilities have a
potential for increasing acceptors. It is expected that there would be 1,891
sessions per year in 28 Government family planning clinics with 39.5 sessions
per week. New acceptors through these facilities are estimated to increase
from 2,850 in 1975 to close to 10,000 in 1980. It is based on the assumption
that the new acceptors would increase by 1.5 over the existing number of 3 per
session in 1975, by 3 in 1977, and by 5 in 1979 and 1980 or would increase from
3 at present to 8 in 1979 and 1980.
(iv)  Total New!Acceptors
The following table summarizes the number of new acceptors to be
expected from various sources.

Project and Program Effect   4,800    -        1,544  21,962  21,762
It shows that the total number of new acceptors increases from 4,800 in 1973
to 22,000 per year after 1980 as a result of the project and program effect
and from 4,800 in 1973 to about 12,000 per year after 1980 as a result of the
project effect alone.
B. Births Averted
Given the number of acceptors, births averted each year would
depend on:
(a)    women-years of protection which is determined by (i) the type of
contraceptives used which determines their effectiveness or failure
in use; and (ii) the continuation rate of acceptors or how long
they continue to practice contraception; and



ANNEX 17
Page 5 of 11 pages
(l)    the fertility of acceptors or the probability of conception if
those acceptors had not joined the program.
(i) Contraceptive Methods
In Trinidad the most popular method was oral contraceptives up to
1969 as 73% of the acceptors chose this method.  In 1970, it suffered a set-back
due to rumors but even then half of the new acceptors used oral pills. The
acceptors of IUDs were 5% in 1969 and only 2.4% in 1970. It is expected that
at least one half of the acceptors would use oral contraceptives in the
future as the confidence in pills is restored. The future composition of
methods is therefore assumed to be the same as in 1970.
(ii) Continuation Rates
The results of a survey of knowledge, attitude and practice of con-
traceptive being conducted are not yet available. Buttwo small studies of continu-
ation rates were made in 1969 by the FPA and the Government. The first studied
the continuation rates of different contraceptive methods over a four-year
period whereas the latter was a study of the continuation rates in clinics
(i.e. what is measured is the frequency with which women return to clinics
rather than whether they continue to use specific methods even if they leave
the program) over a one-year period. The results of these studies are given
in the following table, which show the percentage of women continuing at the
end of successive years.

Continuation rates for new acceptors in the program are estimated on
the basis of the above evidence. Continuation rates for pills would be close
to those given in FPA study and those for 'other methods' would be slightly
lower than those of pills as indicated in the Government study. Also, to allow



ANNEX 17
Page 6 of 11 pages
for failure in use, the number of effective users would be smaller than those
who continue to use a given method. The assumed continuation rates and
proportion of effective users for pills and other methods are given in the
following table (in percent).

5% of the users of pills and 10% of users of other methods (condoms, jelly,
foam tablets, etc.) would not be effective due to irregularity in use or
failure of method.
(iii) Women Years of Protection
Given the effective users of different methods, the women years of
protection would depend on the time pattern of entry of acceptors in the
program. It is assumed that acceptors are equally distributed throughout the
year and that discontinuation occurs at the same rate each month throughout
the year. The number of months of protection contributed each year by a
cohort of 100 women who accept family planning services in a year is calculated
and then converted into years. On this basis, a cohort of 100 women remaining
in the program for five years contribute 42 years of protection in the first
year, 68 years in the second year. 41 years in the third year, and 29 years in
the fourth and 10 years in the fifth year. These coefficients are then used
to estimate total women-years of protection for the estimated number of new
acceptors in the project.
(iv) Births Averted
The number of births averted out of the given women years of pro-
tection depends on the fertility of acceptors or the probability that they
would have conceived if they had not become acceptors. This fertility is
estimated on the basis of the fertility of married women who are not acceptors.
This is estimated to 200 per 1,000 married women, which would mean that five
women-years of protection would avert one birth. A lag of one year is
assumed between the acceptance of a method and a birth averted. The number
of acceptors, women-years of protection and births averted as a result of the
project effect (Projection I) are given in the following table.

C. Effect on the Birth Rate
The project and program's effect on the birth rate is difficult to
measure since a projection of the birth rate in the absence of the project is
difficult to forecast. An estimate of the trend in the birth rate is made by
projecting the decline in fertility from 1967-69. The birth rate declined
from 28.9 in 1967 to 27.0 in 1969 or by 0.85 points per year. This trend is
extended to 1985, as a measure of the level of fertility without the project.
It is then compared with the decline in the birth rate as a result of the
project effect (Projectionl) and the project and program effect (Projection II)
in the following table.

ANNEX 17
Page 8 of 11 pages
This table shows that the rate of decline of the birth rate is twice as rapid
with the project (Projection I). While the birth rate is projected to decline
from 24.0/1,000 to 21.5/1,000 from 1975 to 1980 without the project it is
estimated to decline to 17.5/1,000 in 1980 with the project. If the project
and program effect (Projection II) is used then this decline will be more than
twice as rapid.
D. Population Size and Growth Rate
Given the projected birth rates under alternative assumption the
population can be projected with additional estimates of future mortality
and migration. The estimates of mortality and migration used to project
population were similar for the three cases (birth rate without the project,
Projection I and Projection II) and were as follows:
Mortality - The death rate falls from 6.4 in 1970-75 to 6.2 in
1980-85 and remains constant at that level.  The corresponding increase in
expectation of life is from 69 years to 72 years during the period.  The
survival ratios are obtained from t,he estimate given in a research paper of the
Central Statistical Organization.Il
Migration - No migration is assumed as it is difficult to estimate
any trend due to sharp changes in migration in the country in the past.
In the year 2000 population would be 1.50 million under Projection I
(project effect) as compared to 1.57 million without the project representing
a gain of about 70,000 or 4.5% of the population without the project. With a
faster decline in fertility as obtained under Projection II (project and
program effect) the size of population would be 1.47 million or 97,300 (6.2%)
smaller than otherwise. Details of the increase in population size and the
growth rate from 1970-2000 are given in the following table while age and sex
distribution under projection II which is used in the subsequent section, is
given in the table at the end of this Annex.

E. Labor Force
The labor force estimates have been estinated by (i) taking the
projected population in the economically active age group (15-59 years) and
(ii) assuming that 66.2% of the population in these ages participate in
economic activity. The labor force with the project would be smaller by
14,000 in 1995 and by 37,000 in 2000, or 2.1% and 5.2% of the total
respectively. The new entrants in the labor force with the project would be
26.5% less than without the project in 1990-95 and 57.5% in 1995-2000.
Details are given in the following table.

In summary, the demographic benefits are:
(i)    an increase in the number of new acceptors by 22,000 in 1980;
(ii)   a reduction in the size of the population by more than 21,000 in
1980 and 97,000 in year 2000;
(iii)  a reduction in the rate of growth of population from a little less
than 2% in 1970 to 0.9 in 1980 as compared to 1.5% without the
project;
(iv)   a reduction in the size of the labor force by 14,000 in 1990 and
37,000 in year 2000; and
(v)    new entrants in the labor force would be reduced by 26% in 1990-95
and 57.5% in 1995-2000

ANNEX 18

ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THE PROJECT
This Annex considers the effect of a slower rate of population
growth on increases in per capita income (resulting from a reduced dependency
burden) in the short run, and a smaller labor supply and reduced unemployment
in the longer run. Other economic effects, which follow from these initial
effects, such as increases in labor productivity because of higher consumption,
better health, and education as well as potential savings and investments per
worker are not considered. Equally, important social aspects, such as
improved health and welfare for mothers and children, more equitable income
distribution, etc. are not included.
I. Past Trends
A. Per Capita Income
The imbalance between population and resources in Trinidad has been
reflected in recent years in the slow growth of per capita income, high rate
of tnemployment, and heavy emigration. The rate of growth of the economy
slowed down in 1960-65 after the rapid growth of the second half of the
fifties, when the Gross National Product (GNP) grew at 10% per year, mainly
as a result of petroleum production. In 1960-65 the slower growth of GNP
-- 4.5% per annum at constant (1960) prices -- was largely offset by a 3.0%
rate of population growth resulting in an increase per capita income of only
1.5%.  During 1965-68 the real growth in GNP further declined to 3.7%.  The
rate of growth of population was 1.6% per annum and hence per capita income
increased by 2%. In 1968-70, the increase in GNP was lowest at 2.2% in
real terms and per capita income increased by less than 1%. These data are
summarized below.

This indicates the necessity of a slower rate of growth of population, coupled
with the diversification of the economy if rapid economic development is
to be achieved.
B. Unemployment
As a result of the past high rates of population growth, the
economy is now facing a serious problem of unemployment. The Plan states
that 14% of the labor force was unemployed in 1968. This proportion is
estimated to be about the same in 1969 and 1970. The magnitude of the
problem is shown in the following table.
Labor Force and Unemployment (in '0OOs)

1968   368        63         315           53        116          14
1973   417        48         363           54        102          13
1/ Draft Third Five-Year Plan
In the above table Cols. 1-3 show the increase in the labor force,
the number of additional jobs that will be created, and the numbers employed,
as estimated in the Draft Third Five-Year Plan. Col. 4 shows the estimated
number of unemployed persons (Col. 1 minus Col. 3). To eliminate unemploy-
ment the number of jobs that has to be created is shown in Col. 5. This is
the sum of the jobs that will be created in the Third Plan (Col. 2) and the
estimated number of unemployed (Col. 4).
In summary, the numbers unemployed increased from 37,000 in 1960 to
53,400 in 1968. The Third Five-Year Plan estimates that 48,000 jobs would be
created during 1968-73 as against the requirement of 102,000. This would
absorb only the new entrants in the labor force while the backlog of unemploy-
ment would continue. Unemployment not only represents a potential loss of
output but a burden on the economy for the maintenance of unemployed persons.
the standard of consumption of the employed and unemployed do not
markedly differ. Assuming a per capita consumption of TT$ 500 per year, the
annual cost of unemployment is about TT$ 26 million or 13% of present annual
investments in the economy.
C. Emigration
Unemployment has resulted in emigration in the late sixties. While
this may eliminate unemployment costs, it leads to the serious problem of the
brain drain and limits the potential growth of the economy. The Plan states
that: "Even without the relevant statistics which are now being prepared, it
is well known that this country is an exporter of skilled manpower. The most
visible groups are nurses, teachers, doctors, engineers and skilled craftsman
such as mechanics. This outflow of better quality workers in the labor force
has accounted for shortages of key personnel in such vital services as health
and education."

II, Future Prospects
The above analysis suggests that a slower rate of natural increase
would (i) increase the per capita income and reduce the dependency ratio;
and (ii) alleviate the long term unemployment problem. This is discussed
below.
A. Per Capita Income
The Plan projects a 5% rate of growth of GDP between 1973-85
current prices which is equivalent, on the basis of past increases in prices,
to a 3.3% increase in real terms. A continuation of the present rate of
growth of population would result in small increases in per capita income.
Even with the decline in population growth rate which can be expected in the
absence of the project, the increase in per capita income would not be sub-
stantial.  During 1975-85, a 1.6% annual growth of population (without the
project) would allow the per capita income to grow by only 1.7%. With the
project, the population growth rate would be 1.1% and therefore per capita
income may increase at an average annual rate of 2.2%. These trends are
summarized in the following table.

This table implies that the effect of the project is to lead to a per capita
income that is 5% higher than otherwise by 1985. To achieve equivalent
increases in per capita income without the project would require increases in
net investment equal to 20% of GDP over the 1975-85 period on the basis of a
3.9 incremental capital-out-put ratio. This ratio is derived from the Third
Five-Year Plan (1968-73) which showed expected increases in output of
TT$ 354 million per year as against investments of TT$ 907 million. A
population project is not, of course, the only way to achieve this degree of
improvement in per capita income; it is, however, a much cheaper way of doing
so than the leading alternative approach, i.e. increasing the growth of
national income by raising the investment rate. While the operating costs of
the project in 1975 will be around TT$ 2.7 million, it would require more than
15 times that much of additional investment to achieve the same result.

B.  Unemployment Trends
The Plan estimates that at least 150,000 new jobs will have to be
created between 1974-83 if unemployment is to be eliminated -- 102,000
because of the increase in labor force and over 50,000 for the unemployment
that existed in 1973. To provide jobs to the additional labor force alone
(102,000 jobs) would require an investment of more than TT$ 2,300 million.
(This is two and a half times the net investment estimated for 1968-73).
This implies unrealistic expectations on the economy's capacity to save and
hence there will still be some substantial unemployment in 1983. In that
year, the Plan aims at full employment with investment requirements of
TT$ 3,500 million between 1974 and 1983. To achieve this goal the savings
rate would have to increase from 7.5% to 14.5% of the national income.  Such
a doubling in savings rates is difficult with the m7dest real increase in per
capita income to be expected without the project. 1
The effect of the project will be to lead to a labor force that is
smaller than otherwise by 14,000 in 1995 and 37,000 in 2000 (see Annex 17).
To provide employment for these numbers would require an investment of more
than TT$ 300 million in 1990-95 and TT$ 850 million in 1995-2000 (the latter
is equal to 95% of the net investment made in 1968-73 in the economy). A
successful family planning program will therefore reduce these investment
requirements for providing employment or reduce the number of unemployed by
37,000 in the year 2000.
Between 1980 and 1990, the project may help in alleviating unemploy-
ment by reducing the dependency ratio and possibly increasing the savings
rate. The dependency ratio (children under 15 years per person in aged
15-59 years would be substantially reduced. In 1990 this ratio would be 27%
lower with the project than otherwise.  The following table summarizes the
effect of the project on the dependency ratio:

1980               .49          .53               6.4
1985               .38          .44              17.7
1990               .31          .39              26.8
1995               .28          .34              21.2
Such an extensive reduction in the dependency burden increases the potential
for larger savings and investments as family size is reduced.
