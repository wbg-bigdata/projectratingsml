INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO THE INDUSTRIAL CREDIT AND INVESTIENT
CORPORATION OF INDIA LIMITED WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE
GOVERNMENT OF INDIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Limited
(ICICI) with the guarantee of the Government of India for the equivalent of
US$80 million to help finance ICICI's operations through September 1979. The
terms of the loan would be an interest rate of 8.2% per annum and repayment
up to a maximum of 17 years, including 3 years of grace, according to the
amortization schedule of sub-projects.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        An economic report, "Economic Situation and Prospects of India"
(1529-IN dated April 25, 1977), was distributed to the Executive Directors
on May 3, 1977. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
Background
3.        India is exceptional among the Bank Group's member countries for
its size and diversity; the country is divided into more than 20 States with
a population of some 630 million speaking over 60 languages. Since Independ-
ence the trend in growth of GNP has been about 3.5% per annum, or a little
over 1% per annum in per capita terms, while over the five years 1971/72 -
1975/76 it fell to as low as 2.5% per annum, in spite of the record harvest
of 1975/76. This unsatisfactory performance is in part the result of the low
availability of investable resources: the net transfer of resources from
abroad has never been above 3% of GNP, and fell to as little as 0.8% between
1969/70 and 1973/74; similarly, while India's domestic savings effort compares
well with other countries at the same average income levels, the rate has very
rarely exceeded 17% of GNP. The investment rate puts India in the lower third
of all developing countries. More significant perhaps is the fact that in
spite of a marked rise in the investment rate from about 10% in the early 1950's
to about 18% over the past fifteen years, the trend in GNP growth has remained
about the same. This indicates a marked decline in the efficiency of capital
use, as a result of increasing capacity underutilization, long project gesta-
tion, and increased emphasis on relatively capital-intensive projects and
sectors.
4.        Since Independence the growth of the socio-economic infrastructure
(transport, education, health services, etc.) has been impressive, but has

President's Report on the Bombay High Offshore Development Project
(Report No. 2062-IN), dated June 20, 1977).



often been achieved at high cost and has yielded results of variable quality.
Many industrial and agricultural investment schemes have been highly success-
ful, but others have taken excessively long to be completed and have operated
well below full capacity. In some regions of the country, growth and struc-
tural change have been rapid and compare favorably with developments in many
other parts of the world; in other regions there has been stagnation, and in
some, decline. Although national income has increased in most years, there
has been no rise in the living standards of the vast mass of rural and urban
poor, conservatively estimated at 200 million people with per capita incomes
of US$70 per annum (converted at the official exchange rate) and US$250 on a
purchasing power parity basis.
5.        The structure of the economy has been slow to change.    Agriculture
remains the dominant sector, with its share of national product declining
only gradually from about 50% to 42% over the last twenty years. The share
of manufacturing industry has increased only slowly and, since the late 1960's,
has remained approximately constant at about 16%. There has, however, been
a shift in the composition of manufacturing production, with consumer, inter-
mediate, and capital goods now contributing about one-third each, compared
with an overwhelming preponderance of consumer goods 25 years ago.
Recent Trends
6.        In March, 1977, a party other than Congress formed a Government for
the first time since Independence. Undoubtedly, changes in economic policies
and emphasis will be formulated in the course of the next few months. The
state of the economy was not a prominent election issue; in fact the economy
was generally stronger than at any time in the last six years. Although the
growth of GDP in 1976/77 is not expected to have exceeded 2%, this was on top
of the very good growth of 8.8% in 1975/76. Agricultural production is ex-
pected to have fallen by about 3%, but only because of the return to a more
normal harvest of 110-114 million tons of foodgrains after the record 121
million tons of the previous year. Industrial growth was around 10% in 1976/77,
which is significantly above the rates achieved in the late 1960's and early
1970's. Exports continued their bright performance, rising by 18% in US dol-
lars and 12% in volume terms. The overall resource position, with record
foreign exchange and foodgrain reserves, is exceptionally strong, and gives
the Government considerable room for maneuver.
7.        In agriculture the bumper crop of 1975/76 was largely due to
remarkably good weather conditions; the good crop in 1976/77 - a foodgrain
harvest in the region of 110 million tons would be the second largest on
record - was produced under generally normal weather. A conspicuous change
was the increase in fertilizer use, which rose by more than 20% over 1975/76,
following marked declines in fertilizer prices. Industrial production bene-
fited from fewer labor disputes, fuller utilization of installed capacity
in both private and public sectors, a more liberal import policy, relatively
good power availability, and increased demand because of higher consumer
incomes, expanded exports and higher public expenditures. However, whole-
sale prices, which had fallen 14% from September 1974 through March 1976,



- 3 -
rose 11% from the end of March to December 1976 and continued rising into
1977. It is not yet clear whether this upsurge indicates a new inflationary
trend or merely a correction of the previous sharp decline in the relative
prices of a range of agricultural commodities.
8.        The balance of payments situation has improved dramatically since
the 1973-1975 period. In 1975/76 the trade deficit was $1,530 million, which
was more than covered by US$1,560 million in net aid, US$205 million in net
purchases of currency from the IMF, and US$559 million in net miscellaneous
capital and invisibles (mostly private remittances); indeed, this large
aggregate net resource inflow led to a US$794 million increase in foreign ex-
change reserves, to a level of US$2.2 billion. In 1976/77, the trade deficit
is estimated to have fallen by US$1,080 million, due to a rise of US$845
million in exports and also to a fall of US$235 million in imports, primarily
because of lower prices and volumes of foodgrains and fertilizer imports. The
decreased trade deficit, along with a further increase in the net inflow of
miscellaneous capital and invisibles from abroad of US$540 million, more than
offset the fall of US$350 million in net aid and the substantial repurchases
of currency from the IMF, and allowed a US$1.5 billion addition to reserves,
which reached a level of US$3.7 billion at the end of March 1977.
Development Prospects
9.        The favorable economic situation gives the new Government the op-
portunity to address the longer-term constraints on growth. The basic task
is to raise the overall rate of growth from its historic range of 3-4%. In
the long run this will require raising more resources for investment. But it
will also be important to achieve significantly better utilization of avail-
able resources, partly through an immediate boost to industrial demand.
10.       In agriculture, the basic problem remains that, despite the record
foodgrain crop in 1975/76 and the good crop in 1976/77, the long-term growth
rate of foodgrain production has been unacceptably low, at about 2.5% per
annum over the last seventeen years, and only 2% in the last ten. This has
meant that only in good years has there been any margin of production to
cater to per capita growth in food consumption, and in normal years it has
been necessary to import food. There is considerable scope for stepping up
growth both by increasing the use of inputs and by raising the productivity
of existing capacity. Three promising developments in regard to the first
are the sharply higher outlays on irrigation in the Fifth Plan period along
with a renewed determination to complete projects expeditiously; the indica-
tions that private investment in tubewells is picking up again after a slow-
down in the early 1970's; and the recent recovery of fertilizer demand. With
regard to more productive use of existing capacity, there is increased aware-
ness in the Government that the benefits of irrigation projects can be much
increased not only through command area development but also through more
efficient design and operation of major surface irrigation infrastructure.
Also, hopes have been generated for increasing productivity on both irrigated
and rainfed farms through a reorganized and improved extension and research
system, which has been recently introduced in several States in northern and
eastern India.



- 4 -
11.       A strong effort to raise agricultural growth is essential, not only
to meet food requirements, but also because of the pervasive influence of
agriculture on the levels of activity in other sectors of the economy. This
effort must also be so structured as to increase the incomes of small and
marginal farmers, in order to increase production, since they operate 25% of
the cultivated land and account for somewhat more than 25% of production,
and for welfare reasons, since they make up about 70% of rural population
and constitute the majority of those living below the poverty level.
12.       The industrial sector is poised for rapid growth, as the most serious
constraints on the supply side have been removed by the improved situation
with respect to power, coal and imported raw materials and components. There
has been a progressive liberalization of controls and the 1976/77 Central
Budget announced a reduction of some taxes on private industry. In many
cases management of public enterprises has improved, as is reflected in their
markedly higher production and profitability as a group. In the medium
term it is the demand for industrial output that will determine industrial
growth. In certain industries, export demand will provide a strong pull on
production; this is true, for example, for iron and steel, certain chemicals,
some electrical equipment, processed agricultural products, and vehicles.
But the impact of increased exports on overall industrial demand will grow
only slowly given the current low share of exports in sales. If the higher
growth and productivity in agriculture discussed earlier were to materialize,
it would provide a significant stimulus to industry. It is difficult to
specify the linkages explicitly; but because of the large share that agri-
culture holds in GNP, the coefficients do not have to be large for agricul-
tural growth and the concomitant growth in demand for industrially produced
inputs and mass consumption goods to boost overall industrial demand signi-
ficantly. A higher public deficit and increased public investments are
the instruments most directly under Government control, and also those that
can increase demand for industrial products most immediately. The interim
budget of the new Government moves strongly in this direction with a 240%
increase in the planned budget deficit over 1976/77.
13.       Improvement in the supply of energy augurs well for India's
ability to meet the needs of a more rapidly growing economy. Organization-
al and transportation problems in the coal industry have largely been over-
come; production is sufficient to meet demand, stocks are comfortable, and
the industry has good prospects for meeting both domestic and export demand.
Supply of electricity continues to be a concern, because of the vulnerability
of hydro power to variations in the monsoon and the continued existence of
local shortages, even when the overall power situation is satisfactory. But
the severe power supply constraints of the past have been relaxed for the
moment at least, and several institutional improvements promise to reduce
the future incidence of shortages: underutilization of capacity has been
virtually eliminated in well-established power stations; progress has been
made in the organized exchange of power between States thus relieving local-
ized power shortages; and the problems of slow implementation of power invest-
ment due to delayed delivery of materials and equipment have virtually dis-
appeared. In addition, the delays caused by the inability of State Electricity



- 5 -
Boards to finance projects expeditiously have been eased by their improved
financial position following tariff increases, and by increased Plan outlays
by the Central Government. The medium-term prospects for the oil and gas
sector have been further improved by major new finds of oil and gas near the
large offshore Bombay High field. Crude oil from Bombay High was brought to
shore for the first time in May 1976; production reached an annual rate of 2
million tons by Mfarch 1977, and will rise to a level of 12-13 million tons by
1982/83. Although India will continue to import crude at or somewhat above
the current level, much of the foreign exchange burden of rapidly rising
imports will be avoided by the development of these resources. Prospects are
also bright for further discoveries offshore, given the current high level of
exploration activity.
14.       Underlying all other development issues is that of population.    Al-
though India's population growth rate of a little over 2% is not high in com-
parison with most LDCs, the size of the absolute increment - 13 million
annually - is daunting. It appears, however, that population growth may have
passed its peak in the 1960's, and it is expected to continue to slow down,
both because the birth rate will continue to decline and because the death
rate will not fall as steeply as in the past. With a sustained family planning
effort, it should be possible to lower the population growth rate to 1.1% per
annum by the end of the century. Our "best guess" projection of India's
population by 2000 is 880 million. Many of the benefits of family planning
policy will only be felt beyond the turn of the century, but the decline in
fertility will bring about an early change in the age structure of the popu-
lation. The school age group will grow more slowly or not at all after 1981,
thereby reducing the pressures on the primary and secondary education system.
The labor force, however, will continue to grow at a fast rate until the end
of the century.
15.       India's balance of payments position should be comfortable for the
next few years. The combination of past global inflation and increased ex-
ports have reduced the proportion of export earnings needed for debt service
from 30% in 1970/71 to 16% in 1976/77. The ratio is not likely to rise above
this level in the next few years. Given continuing favorable policies, the
volume of exports should continue to grow by 7% to 10% annually in the near
future; and import needs for fertilizer, POL and foodgrains will continue to
require a diminishing proportion of available foreign exchange. The large
inflow of private remittances shows no immediate signs of declining and should
continue to bolster the foreign exchange position in the medium term. Imports,
including a variety of capital goods, have already been liberalized signifi-
cantly. Increased public investment and a revival of the domestic economy is
likely to generate substantial additional import demand. However, this should
be quite manageable, given the currently comfortable foreign exchange position,
bright export prospects, and continuation of the current real level of net aid.
The present situation presents an opportunity to raise the level of investment
and, consequently, reach a more satisfactory level of long-term growth.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
16.       Since 1949, the Bank Group has made 50 loans and 85 development
credits to India totalling US$1,762 million and US$4,338 million (both net
of cancellation), respectively. Of these amounts, US$816 million has been
repaid, and US$1,432 million was still undisbursed as of May 31, 1977.
Annex II contains a summary statement of disbursements as of May 31, 1977,
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
17.       Since 1957, IFC has made 14 commitments in India totalling US$58.4
million, of which US$13.0 million has been repaid, US$7.6 million sold and
US$6.9 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$30.9 million, US$24.4 mil-
lion represents loans and US$6.5 million equity. A summary statement of IFC
operations as of May 31, 1977 is also included in Annex II (page 2).
18.       In recent years, the emphasis of Bank Group lending has been on
agriculture. The Bank Group has been particularly active in supporting minor
irrigation and other on-farm investments through agricultural credit opera-
tions. Major irrigation, marketing, seed development, and dairying are other
agricultural activities supported by the Bank Group. Also, the Bank Group
has been active in financing the expansion of output in the fertilizer sector
and, through its sizeable assistance to development finance institutions, in
a wide range of geographically scattered medium- and small-scale industrial
enterprises. IDA financing of industrial raw materials and components for
selected priority sectors has been instrumental in facilitating better capa-
city utilization in industry. The Bank Group has also been active in suppor-
ting infrastructure development for power, telecommunications, and railways.
Family planning, education, water supply development, and urban investments
have also received Bank Group support in recent years.
19.       The direction of assistance under the Bank/IDA program has been
consistent with India's needs and the Government's priorities. The emphasis
of the program on agriculture, industry, power, urban development and water
supply remains highly relevant. Projects designed to foster agricultural
production through the provision of essential inputs such as credit for
on-farm investments, command area development of existing irrigation schemes,
intensification and streamlining of extension systems, and seed production
form an important aspect of the Bank Group's program for the next several
years. Special emphasis will be given to projects benefiting small farmers.
Projects supporting water supply, sewerage, and urban development also form
an integral part of the Bank's lending strategy to India for the next several
years. Lending in support of infrastructure and industrial investments will
focus on agriculture-, export- and energy-related projects.
20.       The need for a substantial net transfer of external resources in
support of India's economy has been a recurrent theme of Bank economic re-
ports and of the discussions within the India Consortium. Thanks in large
part to the response of the aid community, India has successfully adjusted
to the changed world price situation. However, the basic need for readily



- 7 -
usable foreign exchange assistance, to augment domestic resources, assure
effective utilization of existing capacity, stimulate investment and accele-
rate economic growth, remains. As in the past, Bank Group assistance for
projects in India should include, as appropriate, the financing of local
expenditures. India imports relatively few capital goods because of the
capacity of the domestic capital goods industry. The import component of
projects tends to be especially low in such high-priority areas as agricul-
ture, education, and family planning. For the Bank Group to be able to make
an appropriate contribution to the financing of projects in these sectors, it
is important to cover a proportion of local expenditures.
21.       It is clear from the review of the Indian economy that as much as
possible of India's external capital requirements should be provided on con-
cessionary terms. Accordingly, the bulk of the Bank Group assistance to
India has been, and should continue to be, provided from IDA. However, the
amount of IDA funds that can reasonably be allocated to India remains small
in relation to India's needs for external support, and some Bank lending
to India, for which the country is creditworthy, is appropriate. As of
May 31, 1977, outstanding loans to India totaled US$973 million, of which
US$494 million remained to be disbursed, leaving a net amount outstanding
of US$479 million.
22.       Of the external assistance received by India, the proportion con-
tributed by the Bank Group has grown significantly. In 1969/70, the Bank
Group accounted for 34% of total commitments, 13% of gross disbursements,
and 12% of net disbursements as compared with an estimated 58%, 24% and 29%,
respectively, in 1975/76. On March 31, 1976, India's outstanding and disbursed
external public debt was US$13.1 billion, of which the Bank Group's share
was 25%. The Bank Group's share is expected to remain around this level in
the future. Because Bank Group assistance to India is predominantly in the
form of IDA credits, debt service to the Bank Group will rise slowly. In
1975/76, about 15% of India's total debt service payments were to the Bank
Group.
PART III - INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Structure and Past Performance
23.       India's industrial output has grown on average by only about 3.5%
per annum since 1965 and manufacturing presently accounts for 16% of NDP,
as opposed to 14% in 1960/61. 1/ Within the manufacturing sector, there
have been gradual changes in structure which reflect the priorities of the
Government's industrial development strategy with consumer goods industries
now contributing less to value added than they did - for example, the food
1/   If industry is more broadly defined to include the remainder of the
secondary sector - utilities and construction - then value added in
industry constitutes about 23% of NDP.



-8-
processing and textile industries' combined share has fallen from 43% in
1960/61 to 28% in 1974/75. Over the same period, the share of "basic" in-
dustries, (defined to include basic metals industries, chemicals and fer-
tilizers), together with the engineering industry, increased from roughly
40% of value added in manufacturing to somewhat more than 50%.
24.       While some two-thirds of manufactured output is estimated to come
from registered plants, which are predominantly medium and large scale, the
more labor-intensive unregistered, mainly small scale, sector employs two-
thirds of the industrial labor force. The Government sector dominates mining
and power generation and, to an increasing extent, the "basic" industries
within the manufacturing sector. Nonetheless, according to the 1970 Annual
Survey of Industry, almost 80% of industrial value added originated in the
private sector, and within the manufacturing sector, the figure was 85%. Even
allowing for the recent nationalization of part of the textile industry,
private industry must still account for at least three-quarters of output from
the manufacturing sector. Within the private sector, food, paper, tobacco and
a number of other industries make important contributions, but textiles,
chemicals and engineering goods continue to be dominant.
25.       In the last three years, industrial performance has improved sub-
stantially. In 1973/74, industry grew by a mere 1%, and in 1974/75 growth
was 2.5%. With an improved supply position the industrial growth rate rose
to 5.5% in 1975/76. Production of key manufacturing inputs, like steel,
coal, and electric power improved dramatically in that year; capital goods
production, which had declined by 4% in 1974/75, also recovered to the level
of 1973/74; but the output of consumer goods slumped by 1.9%. In 1976/77,
overall industrial growth (defined to include electricity and mining) is ex-
pected to be about 10%. Selected data for the first nine months of the fiscal
year show that the growth in the output of capital goods over the corresponding
period of 1975/76 was 8.5%, while consumer goods production has increased by
15.8%. The sustained buoyancy of intermediate goods producing industries is
indicated by the 22.3% increase in steel production and the 14.2% rise in
electricity generation. However, inventories of intermediate goods are high
by historical standards, which indicates that final demand continues to be
a constraint.
The Environment for Industry
26.       Over the last fifteen years, both supply and demand factors have
hindered industrial growth. Supply constraints have perhaps been more per-
sistent. Through much of this period prior claims on foreign exchange con-
strained the availability of essential intermediate inputs not manufactured
in India, and affected the supply of inputs, such as steel, at times when
domestic production was unable to match demand. Equally the unpredictable
effect of the monsoon on the supply of agricultural raw materials, such as
cotton, has constrained industrial growth. Moreover, agricultural supply
bottlenecks have tended to coincide with power shortages, since hydro supply
is also dependent on the monsoon.



- 9 -
27.       However, when these supply constraints have not been binding, de-
mand has usually been depressed. All of the four possible sources of growing
demand - import substitution, exports, the derived demand from the growth of
other major sectors and investment - have been weak. The principal oppor-
tunities for import substitution were largely exhausted by the mid-1960s;
while exports have recently contributed to growth, they still constitute a
very small part of total sales; the relatively slow growth trend of agricul-
ture of little more than 2% has restricted demand for consumer goods; and,
finally, Government real investment remained stagnant until recently 1/.
Industrial Policies Affecting the Private Sector
28.       The Government has placed central emphasis on rapid industrializa-
tion and national self-sufficiency as the keys to development. At the same
time, the Government has sought to curb the concentration of economic power
through expanded public ownership, restrictions on the growth of "large
houses" and "dominant undertakings"; reservation of many products to the
small-scale sector as well as special assistance to it; and finally support
for development in backward regions. The aim of self-sufficiency has largely
manifested itself in the pursuit of tmport substitution as well as curbs on
foreign-owned firms and other forms of foreign involvement in industry.
29.       The main instruments of industrial policy have been central licen-
sing of investment and imports, physical allocation of "scarce" domestically
produced raw materials and controls on industrial prices. This system has
itself tended to conflict with other aims, especially that of curbing econo-
mic concentration, since large firms are much better able to bear the over-
head costs of dealing with a centralized bureaucracy. Controls have also
restricted the ability of firms to respond to changed opportunities,
especially in overseas markets, and thus hampered exports. Finally, price
controls appear to have had a harmful effect on investment and modernization
in such critical industries as cotton textiles, sugar, and cement.
30.       In the last two years, there have been a number of important devel-
opments in industrial policy. In the face of poor industrial performance and
much underutilized or inefficiently utilized capacity, GOI has been recon-
sidering elements of its strategy. It recognized that existing capacity
must be utilized more efficiently; that public sector enterprises should
meet more commercially oriented criteria for output, price, and profitability;
and that there must be increasing emphasis on exporting. It has taken a
number of measures to boost industrial growth, including liberalization of
licensing procedures, relaxation of import and other controls, fiscal in-
centives and more emphasis on industrial modernization.
1/   GOI's budget for FY77 provides for a substantial increase in investments
and plan expenditures. The overall plan outlay (including states) for
FY77 has been increased by about Rs 19 billion or 32% on top of an
increase of 25% in FY76.



- 10 -
Modernization
31.       GOI has announced a modernization program for the textiles, cement,
jute, sugar and engineering industries. The scheme will be monitored by IDBI,
although ICICI will take the lead in the engineering industry. GOI's dis-
bursement targets are Rs 2,000 million per year for the next three years
of which the engineering sector would account for about 20%, although it is
unlikely that this level of disbursements can be achieved. The modernization
funds will be on-lent at 7.5%, compared with a normal lending rate of 11%.
32.       Modernization is, of course, an ongoing process which has been
taking place for some time - about 10% of ICICI's approvals over the last
two years have been for financing modernization, replacement and balancing
equipment. Therefore, the main change will be the additional incentive for
firms to modernize as a result of the availability of cheaper funds. However,
the Government has yet to announce many of the details of these programs
and, more importantly, to set out how the basic structural problems of these
industries are to be tackled.
Conclusion
33.       These various changes mark a cumulatively significant effort on
the part of GOI to tackle the problems of India's private industry within
the context of the overall policy framework. However, major tasks remain,
especially the generation of a satisfactory demand growth and increased
emphasis on efficiency in the use of resources. The improved export per-
formance and increased Government expenditures on top of the higher agri-
cultural income from recent good harvests help explain the recent upturn
in industrial demand. To sustain it, the Government will have to continue
efforts to encourage exports and private investment and, of greatest im-
portance for the immediate future, to raise the level of public expenditure.
Within such framework ICICI has an important role to play in providing funds
for investment and, through its project appraisal, in guiding resources in
an efficient direction.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
34.       The Bank has been closely associated with ICICI since its founda-
tion in 1955. This long association has resulted in substantial Bank Group
resources being channeled to high priority investments in India's private
industry. The Bank has also been a partner in ICICI's institutional develop-
ment by supporting continuing improvements in project appraisal, supervision
and evaluation, and by encouraging wider geographic dispersion of ICICI's
1/   The FY77 budget provided for a reduction in the marginal rate of income
tax from 77% to 66%. The basic exemption level was also raised. To
stimulate investment, the FY77 budget permitted companies an invest-
ment allowance of 25% on the value of plant and machinery.



- 11 -
investments. The relationship with ICICI has also been extremely valuable to
the Bank and also has helped shape the Bank Group's approach to other DFC's.
In particular, the Bank Group/ICICI conducted a major study in 1973 on the
development impact of ICICI and the findings were covered in the report of the
XIth loan. Through ICICI the Bank Group has also developed a better under-
standing than would otherwise have been possible of the problems and prospects
of Indian industry. The proposed loan would be the Bank's twelfth to ICICI
and would bring the total amount of lending by the Bank to ICICI to US$505
million (net of cancellations). It would help finance ICICI's projected for-
eign exchange requirements through September 1979.
35.       The project was appraised in November/December 1976.    A Supplementary
Project Data Sheet is attached as Annex III. A report entitled "Appraisal of
the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation Ltd., India", Report No.
151la-IN, dated June 22, 1977, is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors. Negotiations were held in Washington on April 26, 1977. The
Borrower was represented by a delegation headed by Mr. S.S. Mehta. GOI was
represented by Mr. Saigal.
Objectives of the Loan
36.       The objective of the proposed loan of $80 million would be to con-
tinue to utilize ICICI as an efficient channel for financing high priority
industrial projects many of which are export oriented and/or are located in
backward areas. The loan will also continue to encourage ICICI to undertake
studies of specific development problems, which will be of direct assistance
to ICICI in its operation and which will also have the benefit of adding to
IBRD's understanding of the industrial sector. The loan will continue IBRD
assistance to ICICI in a period when ICICI is making efforts to diversify its
sources of foreign exchange.
Ownership and Resources
37.       Ownership of ICICI is dominated by public sector corporations in-
cluding the Life Insurance Corporation of India, the Unit Trust of India, and
a number of commercial banks, which were nationalized in 1969. Of ICICI's
presently paid-in share capital of Rs 150 million, public institutions hold
76%, foreign shareholders, mainly banks, hold 14% while the balance of 10% is
held by private Indian investors.
38.       Most of ICICI's foreign currency resources have come from IBRD.    Of
total foreign exchange resources of $492 million as of October 31, 1976, eleven
IBRD lines of credit accounted for 85%. Fifteen KfW lines of credit (latest
1976) accounted for 10% and six UK lines of credit (latest 1975) for 3% of
foreign currency resources. The rest (1%) was provided by one USAID line of
credit (1961) and a Swiss bond issue (1973). The latter was the first commer-
cial diversification of ICICI's sources of foreign exchange. ICICI has mean-
while continued to make attempts to mobilize funds from foreign commercial
sources, and is finalizing negotiations for a loan of Kuwaiti Dinars 5 million
(about $17 million) from the Kuwait Investment Company at about 8.75% and re-
payable in lump sum after five years. In view of the short maturity of this



- 12 -
loan, ICICI proposes to blend this Bank loan with the Kuwaiti loan where this
seems appropriate and thereby defer disbursements from the Bank loan in cer-
tain cases. ICICI has also been negotiating with a foreign commercial bank
a $5 million loan for which the terms are still under review.
39.       ICIGI's total local resources of Rs 1.6 billion as of September 30,
1976 were financed in part from ICICI's own bond issues (40%) and in part
from GOI and IDBI loans (37%) and share capital and reserves (23%). Prior to
1975, ICICI had difficulties in raising rupee resources for its expanding
rupee lending, because its debentures did not have trustee security status.
GOI has now granted this status and as a result ICICI could issue rather
large semi-annual bond issues totaling Rs 303 million in 1976, compared to
only Rs 55-80 million in annual bond issues before.
Management and Board
40.       ICICI is well-managed and operates effectively.    Mr. H.T. Parekh
and Mr. S.S. Mehta continue to be Chairman and Managing Director respectively.
The Board consists of 16 directors, of whom four are private industrialists,
three are from public financial institutions, two represent foreign share-
holders, two represent the Government of India, two represent state level in-
stitutions, and the remaining three are officers of ICICI (Chairman, Managing
Director and Joint Managing Director).
Operating Policies and Results
41.       Policies.   In promoting mainly large and medium scale enterprises,
ICICI has emphasized the introduction of new technologies. ICICI has no formal
policy statement but has prepared a financing strategy for the next two years
which emphasizes the following sectors: (a) export industries; (b) power and
transport; (c) agricultural inputs and outputs; (d) industries basic to
industrial expansion; (e) mass consumption goods; and (f) balancing and
modernization projects. About 80% of ICICI's lending by amount in 1975,
and 88% in the first 10 months of 1976 as well as 82% of ICICI's pipeline of
projects is in these sectors.
42.       ICICI's lending rates were last increased in December 1975.     For
ordinary loans, local currency rates were increased from 10.25% to 11%, and
foreign currency rates from 10.5% to 11%. For concessionary loans (backward
areas), local currency rates were increased from 8.5% to 9.5%, and foreign
currency rates from 9.5% to 10%. The foreign exchange risk is borne by the
borrowers. These rates conform with those offered by other term lending
financial institutions in India.
43.       ICICI's Procedures.    ICICI's project appraisals continue to be
thorough and sound. Technical, financial, management and market aspects are
well covered and the evaluation of the projects' economic contribution is
satisfactory. Follow-up procedures and project supervision are also satis-
factory. ICICI is a member of the Inter-Institutional Meeting which comprises
the leading All-India financial institutions and which enables these institu-
tions to coordinate their activities.



- 13 -
44.       ICICI generally requires that its clients procure equipment on the
best terms. It insists on competitive quotations from three or more manufac-
turers or suppliers of international standing. Bids are carefully evaluated.
Disbursement procedures are satisfactory. Since November 1975, ICICI has
opened its own letters of credit in order to provide faster service to its
clients.
45.       Operational Results.   Recent ICICI operations have reflected the
economic slow down of 1974 and 1975 and the beginnings of a recovery in 1976.
For instance, ICICI's total net approvals fell slightly in 1975 to Rs 712 mil-
lion as compared to Rs 723 million in 1974, but picked up substantially in
the first ten months of 1976 when approvals were 18% higher (Rs 841 million)
than in the total year of 1975. Disbursements, which show a time lag compared
to approvals, fell from Rs 555 million in 1974 to Rs 546 million in 1975 but
are estimated to reach Rs 655 million 1976. As a result of improved avail-
ability of domestic capital goods, rupee loan approvals increased as a per-
centage of total approvals from 24% in 1974 to 43% in the first ten months of
1976.
46.       ICICI has continued to emphasize lending to sectors such as chemicals/
petrochemicals (21% of approvals), metals and metal products (17% of approvals)
and machinery manufacture (10% of approvals). Joint sector projects accounted
for 13% of approvals from 1974 to 1976. Half of its loans are to new clients
and some 7% of its loans to new entrepreneurs. About 39% of its lending dur-
ing 1975 and the first 10 months of 1976 was for projects in backward areas.
The financial performance of ICICI clients improved in 1974/75 with the return
on capital employed rising from 16.1% in 1973/74 to 18.2% in 1974/75.
47.       Financial Results.   Net profits after tax increased from Rs 25 mil-
lion in 1973 to Rs 27 million in 1974, Rs 35 million in 1975 and are esti-
mated at Rs 35 million in 1976. The relatively sharp increase in 1975 was
mainly due to tax concessions, including the reversion of excess provisions
for income tax and surtax to income.   Over the past four years, ICICI's net
profit as a percentage of average equity has been about 11%, which is satisfac-
tory. The dividend payment in 1975 was increased from 10% to 11%, partly to
show a good dividend record for its next capital issue which is expected in
1977. However, this dividend still allowed for a satisfactory profit plough-
back of 53%. Administrative expenses remained under control at 0.5-0.6% of
average total assets. However, because the average cost of borrowings in-
creased faster than the return on loans (partly due also to increased lending
in backward areas at concessional rates), the spread on lending operations
declined from 2.8% in 1973/74 to 2.5% in 1975/76. As a result, profits after
tax and provisions declined from 1.3% of average total assets in 1973 to 1.1%
in 1976. Profitability, although relatively low, is still adequate. The
declining trend should be reversed by 1978 as the 1975 increase in interest
rates begins to have an impact.
48.       Total assets almost doubled from Rs 1.8 billion in 1972 to Rs 3.0
billion in 1975 and Rs 3.4 billion in 1976. There was a particularly large
increase (30%) in 1975 mainly because of changes in exchange rates. As of
December 1975, net worth plus provisions constituted 11% of the loan and



- 14 -
investment portfolio. Foreign currency loans accounted for 59% and rupee
loans for 30% of total assets while IBRD borrowings were 48% of ICICI's
equity and liabilities. The debt/equity ratio was 8.6:1 as of September 30,
1976, below the 9:1 limit specified in the Loan Agreement (see Section 4.06).
ICICI's Portfolio
49.       As of September 30, 1976, ICICI's overdues of principal and interest
were Rs 98 million (but dropped slightly to Rs 94 million as of December 31,
1976), compared with Rs 60 million as of December 1975, Rs 51 million as of
December 1974, and Rs 41 million as of December 1973. The total principal
outstanding of loans affected by arrears was Rs 455 million, or about 18% of
the outstanding loan portfolio, compared with 7% in 1973. The increase in
arrears was due mainly to the problems faced by Indian industry since 1972:
power cuts in 1973; credit restrictions in 1974; and, in particular, business
recession in 1975. The recovery in the industrial sector, which began to take
place during 1976, is expected to reduce arrears over the next twelve months.
50.       Three industries - metal products, electrical equipment and chem-
icals - account for a major portion of the increase in arrears (40%, 33% and
18%, respectively). As a percentage of the total portfolio affected by
arrears, they account for 19%, 18% and 15% respectively. These industries
were hit particularly hard by recents developments like power cuts and reces-
sion. ICICI has reorganized its follow-up work and created a separate cell
to concentrate upon the problems of the 30 or so companies among the 120 in
arrears (out of about 1,000), that are in difficulties.
51.       As of September 30, 1976 ICICI's equity portfolio comprised common
share investments of Rs 147 million in 250 companies and preference shares of
Rs 92 million in 67 companies. Some 50% of the equity portfolio was in com-
panies operating profitably and paying dividends, 21% in companies under con-
struction or start-up and 29% in companies in difficulties, of which about 2%
was in some jeopardy. The average market price of the common shares was 105%
above book value, substantially lower than the 132% on June 30, 1974, reflect-
ing the trends in the stock market. The average dividend yield was about 4.4%
in 1976, although taking into account also capital gains after tax the average
yield was 6.4% which is moderately satisfactory. As of December 31, 1975,
ICICI also held debentures of Rs 150 million in 67 companies. In 1975, the
average yield on debentures was 7.7%. ICICI's investment portfolio continues
to be well managed despite the rather difficult economic circumstances of
recent years.
ICICI's Role in GOI's Modernization Program
52.       As mentioned earlier, ICICI has been asked to be responsible for the
engineering industry under the modernization program. ICICI plans to under-
take a study of selected sub-sectors of the engineering industry, an outline
of which was agreed during negotiations. When determining the extent of the
involvement in the modernization program, ICICI will take the necessary steps
to ensure that its profitability and capital structure remain adequate.



- 15 -
Resource Requirements
53.       Recent dramatic improvements in India's foreign exchange position
should permit GOI to pursue an increasingly expansionary macro-economic policy.
If adopted, this would also increase the demand for private investment and
lead to an increased demand for loans from the industrial financial institu-
tions. At the same time, GOI is likely to increase the allocation of free
foreign exchange for industrial purposes. In this situation, some firms may
prefer to use rupees, either their own or borrowed, and convert them into
foreign exchange loans. The foreign exchange financing requirements for ICICI
over the next two years have been conservatively assessed in recognition of a
possible shift towards rupee loans.
54.       The proposed loan would cover the gap in ICICI's foreign currency
resource requirements between September 1977 (the time when the loan would
become effective) and September 1979. From January 1977 through September
1979 foreign currency commitments would be about $170 million. Against this,
ICICI had foreign currency resources available for commitment of about $40
million on December 31, 1976 and expects to borrow through September 1979,
some $30 million from traditional sources (about $4 million per year from KfW
and $6 million per year from UK). It expects to obtain $17 million from the
Kuwait Investment Company during 1977 and further commercial borrowings of $5
million in 1978. This leaves a gap of about $80 million which the proposed
IBRD loan is intended to fill. A loan of that size would account for about
60% of ICICI's foreign currency commitments between September 1977 and
September 1979.
Justification of the Loan
55.       This loan will provide support to a well managed DFC which has had
an important impact upon the development of the industrial sector and which
continues to be engaged in promotional activities and also in the improvement
of industrial efficiency.
(a) ICICI's Development Impact
ICICI's developmental impact was examined in a Special Study under-
taken in 1973 jointly by the Bank and ICICI. One of the main findings was
that ex-post economic rates of return have generally been similar to those
calculated ex ante, generally of the order of 20-35%. These ex-ante economic
rates of return (ERR) indicate that ICICI's appraisal and project evaluation
procedures have ensured the selection of projects with satisfactory benefits
to the Indian economy. The weighted ERR for 1975 and the first half of 1976
were 22.6% and 29.5% respectively. Weighted financial rates of return of ICICI
financed projects were 14.8% for 1975 and 15.6% for the first half of 1976
which is satisfactory.
(b) ICICI Promotional Activities
Hitherto ICICI's promotional activity has included (i) training
of staff from State Financial Corporations and State Industrial Development
Corporations; (ii) participation in industrial surveys conducted throughout



- 16 -
India; (iii) coordination and cooperation with State level institutions
through Inter-Institutional Group Meetings; and (iv) financing the prepara-
tion of feasibility studies and supporting technical consulting services.
More recently ICICI has been concerned with: (i) preparation of
sectoral and policy studies; and (ii) identification of projects to fill
important gaps in the industrial sector. On the former, ICICI involvement
in the preparation of sector/policy studies was initiated under the eleventh
IBRD loan, when ICICI undertook to prepare a study on the problems and pro-
spects of manufactured exports based on a sample of its clients. The study
provides a considerable amount of useful information and is unique in its
attempt to analyze issues related to exports at the firm level. This study
will be followed up by an analysis of "penetration pricing" in export market-
ing. ICICI also plans to undertake a study of the problems and prospects of
selected engineering industries (see para 52). The study would, among others,
focus on (i) demand prospects in both the domestic and export markets; (ii)
upgrading of technology; (iii) domestic subcontracting to ancillaries; and
(iv) the overall employment impact of alternative investment strategies.
ICICI is also involved in a feasibility study of a proposal to establish a
specialized institution to finance lower and middle income housing for which
it is seeking participation by IFC. Finally, ICICI is represented in 7 GOI
Committees/Public Bodies concerned with industrial investment. On the latter
objective, the Project Promotion Department was established in 1974 and has
now seen one project implemented while 9 others are being prepared.
Creditworthiness
56.       ICICI's strong management and staff, its good financial performance
to date and projections for the future show that it is a creditworthy borrower.
The amount of the loan has been based upon ICICI's financing requirements and
would be limited to foreign expenditures. The terms would follow those of
recent Bank loans to development finance companies, including the standard
commitment charge. Every subproject involving ICICI financing of more than
US$4 million, including outstanding commitments, would require IBRD approval
(see Section 2.02(b) of Loan Agreement).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
57.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and ICICI, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between India and the Bank, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii), of the Articles of Agreement,
and the text and draft resolution approving the proposal loan are being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors seperately.
58.       Special conditions of the Project are listed in Section III of
Annex III.
59.       The draft legal documents conform to the normal pattern for loans
to development finance companies.



- 17 -
60.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
60.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION-
Generally, the implementation of projects has been proceeding
reasonably well. Details on the execution of individual projects are
below. The level of disbursements was US$551 million in FY76 or 62%
of Bank Group commitments to India in that year. The undisbursed pipeline
of US$1,524 million as of March 31, 1977, corresponds roughly to com-
mitments over the preceding two-year period and reflects the leadtime
which would be expected given the mix of fast and slow-disbursing projects
in the India program.
Ln. No. 902    Tenth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$70.0 million loan of June 8, 1973; Effective
Date: August 16, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Ln. No. 1097    Eleventh Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of
India Project; US$100 million loan of April 2, 1975;
Effective Date: July 1, 1975; Closing Date: December 31,
1980
These loans have supported industrialization in India through a
well-established development finance company. Loan 902-IN is fully committed
and commitments are progressing satisfactorily for Loan 1097-IN. Disburse-
ments under Loan 902-IN are ahead of schedule.
Ln. No. 614    Tarai Seeds Project; US$13.0 million loan of June 18, 1969;
Effective Date: September 12, 1969; Closing Date: Dec-
ember 31, 1977
This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation is to assist in
the production, processing and marketing of certified seeds of high yielding
varieties. The corporation is working effectively and has developed an ex-
cellent reputation for quality seed. Expansion of three processing plants
is well under way. Delivery of some equipment in damaged condition, and
retendering, because of poor response for some others, has delayed delivery
schedules necessitating an extension of the Closing Date by one year to
December 31, 1977.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Cr. No. 440     Bihar Agricultural Credit Project; US$32.0 million credit
of November 29, 1973; Effective Date: March 29, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Cr. No. 540     Agricultural Refinance and Development Corporation (ARDC)
Project; US$75.0 million credit of April 28, 1975;
Effective Date: August 5, 1975; Closing Date: Dec-
ember 31, 1977
Apart from the Punjab project, which consists of mechanization
equipment only, all the above agricultural credit projects are similar in
structure, being designed to provide long- and medium-term credit to farm-
ers through credit institutions for such on-farm investments as tractors,
minor irrigation and land-leveling. Disbursement of the minor irrigation
components are on schedule. Tractor procurement was delayed following
changes in both the supply and demand situations after the projects were
originally appraised, which prompted GOI to request that indigenous as well
as imported models should be eligible for IDA financing under these credits.
The Executive Directors approved this request in December 1973 and those
credits which have tractor components have been amended accordingly. Tractor
procurement is proceeding satisfactorily. Credit 540 is a continuation

nationwide of the previous program of agricultural credit projects, which
were confined to individual states. ARDC will continue to act as the
financial intermediary for refinancing agricultural credit.
Cr. No. 267    Wheat Storage Project; US$5.0 million credit of August 23,
1971; Effective Date: November 14, 1972; Closing Date:
September 30, 1978
The Food Corporation of India is making satisfactory progress
in the execution of this project. Piling and foundation work is nearly com-
pleted. Silo construction has begun and staff training is in progress.
Cr. No. 456    Himachal Pradesh Apple Processing and Marketing Project;
US$13 million credit of January 22, 1974; Effective Date:
September 26, 1974; Closing Date: December 31. 1978
This project was designed to promote the development of apple
processing and marketing in Himachal Pradesh, and comprises grading and
packing centers, cold storages, a juice processing plant, road improvements
and cableways. The project encountered initial delays due to managerial
and technical problems, however, remedial measures have been taken to over-
come these difficulties. A recent review mission found a satisfactory
improvement in the prospects for successful project implementation.
Cr. No. 403    Telecommunications V Project; US$80.0 million credit of
June 25, 1973; Effective Date: July 30, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1977
Material supply problems which delayed the start of this project
have been resolved and physical achievements were at record levels during
fiscal year 1976. However, to cover the delivery and installation of im-
ported transmission and switching equipment, the closing date was extended
by one year to December 31, 1977.
Cr. No. 377    Power Transmission III Project; US$85.0 million credit
of May 9,, 1973; Effective Date: October 10, 1973; Closing
Date: September 30, 1977
Cr. No. 604    Power Transmission IV Project; US$150.0 million credit of
January 22, 1976; Effective Date: October 22, 1976; Closing
Date: June 30, 1981
For Power Transmission III all equipment has been ordered; there
will be a substantial cost overrun due to international price increases, part
of which is being met from Power Transmission IV. For Power Transmission IV,
bids for most of the equipment have been invited.

Cr. No. 264    Cochin II Fertilizer Project; US$20 million credit of
July 30, 1971; Effective Date: December 2, 1971; Closing
Date: June 30, 1977
Cr. No. 481    Trombay IV Fertilizer Expansion Project; US$50.0 million
credit of June 19, 1974; Effective Date: August 21, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Cr. No. 520    Sindri Fertilizer Project; US$91 million credit of December 18,
1974; Effective Date: February 27, 1975; Closing Date:
September 30, 1978
Ln. No. 1079    IFFCO Fertilizer Project; US$109 million loan of January 24,
1975; Effective Date: April 28, 1975; Closing Date: March 31,
1979
Cr. No. 598    Fertilizer Industry Project; US$105.0 million credit
of December 31, 1975; Effective Date: March 1, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The Cochin Fertilizer Project is being commisssioned, about 31
months behind the appraisal estimate. Progress on the Trombay IV project has
been good although project completion may be delayed by about four months
because of longer than expected delivery times for critical equipment. Under
the Sindri project plant construction and erection is proceeding generally
according to schedule except for a one-month delay due to anticipated delays
in receipt of some materials. Commencement of commercial production is ex-
pected by March 1978. The anticipated cost to complete the project is pre-
sently running within budget. The IFFCO project was delayed by about a year
as a result of a change in feedstock from fuel oil to naphtha and delays in
completion of engineering contracts. The project is now progressing satis-
factorily based on naphtha as feedstock. Site work has begun, process- and
time-critical equipment is being ordered, and engineering work is well under
way. Credit 598-IN is designed to increase the utilization of existing
fertilizer production capacity. The project has encountered delays in sub-
project preparation and investment approvals by the Government. Further,
some of the sub-projects identified earlier may not materialize because of
reconsideration by the Central and State governments. The Central Govern-
ment has submitted a list of sub-projects to replace the ones that are
likely to be dropped. Because of the above, the project is likely to be
delayed by 6-12 months.
Cr. No. 294    Bihar Agricultural Markets Project; US$14.0 million credit
of March 29, 1972; Effective Date: July 31, 1972; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978

Cr. No. 378    Karnataka Wholesale Agricultural Markets Project; US$8.0 mil-
lion credit of May 9, 1973; Effective Date: September 7, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
These projects were designed to help with establishment of whole-
sale markets in a number of towns in Bihar and Karnataka. Progress under
the Bihar project has generally been satisfactory. Markets construction in
Bihar was delayed due to legal challenges arising out of the state's acqui-
sition of land for market sites; however, these difficulties have been satis-
factorily resolved. Construction of markets is well advanced and a number
have opened for business. Progress under the Karnataka project is much less
satisfactory, however, largely due to deficiencies in market planning, design
and construction. These problems and remedial actions have been brought to
the attention of the State and Central Government. The project is being mon-
itored closely to try and bring about the necessary improvements in implemen-
tation.
Cr. No. 312    Population Project; US$21.2 million credit of June 14, 1972;
Effective Date: May 9, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
This credit is designed to finance an experimental and research
oriented population project in Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. The project's
infrastructure, which would provide the optimum facilities (buildings, equip-
ment, staff and transport) according to GOI standards in selected districts
in each state, is almost complete. The two Population Centers, which will
design and monitor research aimed at improving the family planning program,
are now functioning.
Cr. No. 342    Agricultural Universities Project; US$12.0 million credit of
November 10, 1972; Effective Date: June 8, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
The project involves the development of the agricultural uni-
versities in Assam and Bihar. Initial lag in implementation on account
of late appointments of project staff has been overcome. Campus plans
have been approved, and construction has started in Assam and is scheduled
to start in Bihar by mid 1977. Disbursement which has been slow because
of initial delays should accelerate now that construction and equipment
procurement are under way.
Cr. No. 356    Industrial Development Bank of India Project; US$25.0 million
credit of February 9, 1973; Effective Date: June 22. 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Loan No. 1260 Second Industrial Development Bank of India Project;
US$40.0 million loan of June 10, 1976; Effective Date:
August 10, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The first IDBI Project (Cr. 356) had a slow start mainly due to
institutional problems in the participating State Financial Corporations.



ANNEX II
Page 8 of 12
However, the credit is now fully committed. In order to continue Bank
Group's involvement in assisting small and medium scale industries, the
second operation (Ln. 1260) was approved on June 10, 1976, and more than
10% of the loan amount had been authorized by mid-May 1977.
Cr. No. 390    Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$55.0 million
credit of January 22, 1974; Effective Date: March 13, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
A substantial cost overrun on the project from US$158 million
equivalent to about US$375 million equivalent has been caused by inflation
and price increases resulting from delays in appointment of engineering con-
sultants and redesign of certain project components. The project has been
redefined and rephased to fit the financing available from the Credit, local
loans and bonds, and internal cash generation of the project entity. The
revised cost estimates for the implementation period 1975/76 to 1979/80
amount to US$266 million equivalent excluding interest during construction.
All major contracts for civil works, equipment and materials have been
awarded. This is expected to considerably speed up disbursements which
has been slow. Financial performance of the project entity during 1975/76
was satisfactory, and major rate increases from April 1, 1976 should ensure
continuing financial viability of the project entity.
Cr. No. 616    Eleventh Industrial Imports Project; US$200.0 million credit
of February 24, 1976; Effective Date: April 1, 1976; Closing
Date: June 30, 1977
This credit was signed on February 24, 1976, and became effective
on April 1, 1976.
Cr. No. 427    Calcutta Urban Development Project; US$35.0 million credit
of September 12, 1973; Effective Date: January 10, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Following considerable increases in project costs, GOI and IDA
finalized a project redefinition in April 1976, to accommodate the project
to funding available. It is now expected to be substantially completed by
March 1979. Agreements have been reached on consultants services and
technical assistance, as provided for under the project.
Cr. No. 482    Karnataka Dairy Development Project; US$30 million credit of

Cr. No. 522    Madhya Pradesh Dairy Development Project; US$16.4 million
credit of December 18, 1974; Effective Date: July 23, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
These three credits totalling US$74.1 million support dairy devel-
opment projects organized along the lines of the successful AMUL dairy coop-
erative scheme in Gujarat State. The Karnataka Project which got off to a
slow start has begun to show improvement tinder new management appointed
recently. Farmer response has been good and about 250 dairy cooperatives
with small farmer participation are functioning effectively. Two Dairy
Unions have been established. Close supervision is being maintained. In
Madhya Pradesh good progress has been made. About 110 new dairy cooperatives
societies have been established. Detailed design studies for plant construc-
tion are complete. Technical services investments are being made. Contracts
have been placed for livestock imports. The Rajasthan project is also doing
well. Four milk unions have been formed and excellent progress has been made
in organizing the servicing of nearly 350 dairy cooperatives at the village
level. Plant-designs are ready, and procurement is to start soon. KDDC
decision to procure plant equipment jointly with RDDC and MPDDC on the same
tender should lead to a recovery of considerable time lost earlier.
Cr. No. 532    Godavari Barrage Project; US$45 million credit of March 7,
1975; Effective Date: June 9, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1980
Both the civil works and equipment tenders have been awarded after
international competitive bidding. Work is in progress.
Ln. No. 1011   Chambal (Rajasthan) Command Area Development Project; US$52
million loan of June 19, 1974; Effective Date: December 12,
1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
Cr. No. 502    Rajasthan Canal Command Area Development Project; US$83 mil-
lion credit of July 31, 1974; Effective Date: December 30,
1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
Cr. No. 562    Chambal (Madhya Pradesh) Command Area Development Project;
US$24 million credit of June 20, 1975; Effective Date:
September 18, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Ln. No. 1251   Andhra Pradesh Irrigation and Command Area Development
(TW)         Composite Project; US$145.0 million loan (Third Window)
of June 10, 1976; Effective Date: September 7,1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
These projects, based on existing large irrigation systems, are
designed to improve the efficiency of water utilization and, where possible,
to use water savings for bringing additional areas under irrigation. Canal
lining and other irrigation infrastructures, drainage, and land shaping are

prominent components of these projects. In addition, provisions have been
made to increase agricultural production and marketing by reforming and
upgrading agricultural extension services and by providing processing and
storage facilities and village access roads. Progress of these projects
is generally satisfactory and particularly successful with respect to
agricultural extension.
Cr. No. 541    West Bengal Agricultural Development Project; US$34 million
credit of April 28, 1975; Effective Date: August 28, 1975;
Closing Date: March 31, 1980
The project became effective on July 31, 1975. Successful reor-
ganization of agricultural extension services has been a major achievement,
but preparations for lending operations have been slow mainly due to poor
coordination of project agencies. IDA and the government of West Bengal
have agreed on measures to improve coordination and on a timetable covering
a range of project activities. Progress with preliminaries for procurement
of equipment, markets construction and riverlift completions are satis-
factory.
Cr. No. 526    Drought Prone Areas Project; US$35.0 million credit of
January 24, 1975; Effective Date: June 9, 1975; Closing
Date: June 30, 1980
Overall progress is satisfactory. Expenditure to date is less
than expected -- about 22% of project cost estimates -- but is reasonable
because inflation has been much less than expected. The most successful
component of this multi-componented project is dairying, which has a sig-
nificant impact on rural incomes. Other components are, in general, meeting
appraisal targets in terms of physical achievements, although with some
time lag. There are, however, several technical problems which need to be
overcome. DPAP is largely innovative program and the emergence of such
problems was expected. The identification of these problems represents a
major first step to their resolution and subsequently to establishing pro-
grams which can be replicated throughout India's 72 drought prone districts.
Cr. No. 572    Rural Electrification Project; US$57.0 million credit of
July 23, 1975; Effective Date: October 23, 1975; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
Eleven states have now fulfilled the conditions of eligibility for
on-lending under this project [compared with six at the time of appraisal]
The project got off to a slow start, due principally to the need to adapt
specifications and tender documents to international competitive bidding
procedures, but these problems have been overcome. As of September 1976,
orders had been placed for 60 approved rural electrification schemes, and
tenders had been invited or were in the course of preparation for others.

Cr. No. 582    Railways XIII Project; US$110.0 million credit of August 26,
1975; Effective Date: October 10, 1975; Closing Date:
September 30, 1977
The project is intended to cover most of the foreign exchange
requirements of Indian Railway's (IR) investment program from April 1, 1975,
through March 31, 1977. Since the approval of the project, increased pro-
duction in steel products in India and further developments in IR's indigen-
ization program have resulted in a less than anticipated foreign exchange
requirement. It is expected, therefore, that of a total Credit of US$110
million, some US$30-40 million may be undisbursed at the end of the current
project period. During the year 1975/76, IR carried 223 million tons of
freight traffic, 6% more than forecasted. The project is being implemented
satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 585    Uttar Pradesh Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$40.0
million credit of September 25, 1975; Effective Date:
February 6, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project had a slow start due to delays in preparation of techni-
cal reports for regional and local water authorities. The technical reports
for about a third of the project have now been finalized and construction
works started in October 1976, about one year behind schedule. All consul-
tants for engineering, organization, management and accounting services for
the Jal Nigam (Water Supply Development Corporation) and the Jal Sansthans
(water authorities) have been engaged. Significant institutional develop-
ment can be expected only after the consultants submit their final recommenda-
tions. The project is expected to be completed by March 1980, approximately
9 months behind schedule.
Cr. No. 609    Madhya Pradesh Forestry Technical Assistance Project;
US$4.0 million credit of February 26, 1976; Effective
Date: May 26, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
This project will identify a sound resource base for pulp and paper
manufacture and related industries, develop suitable logging systems, and
undertake a feasibility study to determine optimal use of the existing wood
resources in the Bastar District of southern Madhya Pradesh. It also includes
a study of ways to integrate the area's tribal population with future develop-
ment. After initial delays due to difficulties in employing key personnel,
project implementation is now satisfactory. For the feasibility study, proj-
ect authorities have prepared a short list of three foreign consulting firms,
who are now being asked to prepare detailed proposals. On the basis of these
proposals, the final selection will be made shortly.
Cr. No. 610    Integrated Cotton Development Project; US$18.0 million
credit of February 26, 1976; Effective Date: November 30,

Ln. No. 1273   National Seed Project; US$25.0 million loan of June 10, 1976;
Effective Date: October 8, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
Good progress has been made since negotiations. The National
Seeds Corporation (NSC) has withdrawn from seeds production as planned, hav-
ing handed over to State Seeds Corporation (SSC). Detailed production pro-
grams, by variety and responsible institution, have been prepared for breeder,
foundation and certified generations. GOI and State Governments have made
equity contributions to SSC thus ensuring financing of major project activity.
Orders will shortly be placed for processing machinery to provide bridging
capacity pending the construction of new processing plants. Tender documents
for the first purchases of farm machinery have been finalized.
Ln. No. 1313    Sixth Telecommunications Project; US$80.0 million loan
of July 22, 1976; Effective Date: September 14, 1976;
Closing Date: March 31, 1980
Disbursements have commenced and the project is progressing satis-
factorily.
Ln. No. 1335   Bombay Urban Transport Project; US$25.0 million loan of
December 20, 1976; Effective Date: March 10, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30. 1980
Procurement work is well in hand. Contracts for 275 single and
175 double deck bus chassis have been awarded and bidding for corresponding
bus bodies is in progress. Civil works for bus facilities have been partly
commissioned and bidding for 18 of 31 traffic engineering schemes is in
progress. Preparations for technical assistance envisaged under the project
are under way.
