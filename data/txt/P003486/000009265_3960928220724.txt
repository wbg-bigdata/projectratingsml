MEHORAWN AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TEE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A FIFTH RAILWAY PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recomuendation on a proposed loan to
help finance the railways of China for $330 million equivalent is submitted
for approval. The loan would be for 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate. The proposed onlending terms
between the Ministry of Finance (MOP) and the Ministry of Railways (MR) would
be 20 years including five years of grace at 5 percent interest rate. MR will
bear the foreign exchange risk.
2.        Background.  Railway traffic in China has been growing at a very
rapid rate: 68 percent from 1970 to 1980 and 89 percent from 1980 to 1989.
In 1989, China's railways carried 1,086 billion freight ton-kilometers
(63-percent of all freight traffic in China, equivalent to two thirds of the
traffic carried by US railways) and 303 billion passenger-kilometers (50 per-
cent of all passenger traffic in China). Rail traffic is expected to maintain
a somewhat lower, but still high, growth rate in the next decade. The freight
ton-kilometers hauled per dollar of gross national product in China is the
highest in the world. Compared with the traffic growth, investment in raii.
ways has been inadequate, and MR has had to resort to intense utilization of
its existing assets. MR has managed to carry the continuously growing traffic
volumes without significant improvements in rail technology and operations
that have been occurring elsewhere in the world. While such improvements in
technology would not have obviated the need for any expansion in basic infra-
structure--new main line routes, double-tracking of existing routes, and new
and expanded terminals would still have been needed--they would have raised
the traffic-carrying capacity of China's railways significantly in critical
corridors at least cost. However, the shortage of funds (both local and for-
eign) and a lack of the necessary domestic manufacturing capability have hin-
dered the adoption of even the most cost-effective improvements in technology.
At the same time, the need for additional capacity combined with the limited
availability of resources has resulted in a backlog of overdue maintenance and
rehabilitation for track, locomotives, and rolling stock, which may become
critical if new investments in capacity are not made.
3.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations.  Out of the ptevious
five railway projects, only the first project (Loan 2394-CHA) has been closed,
on December 31, 1990. A PPAR (No. 9735, dated June 24, 1991) has been issued.
The physical components of the project were successfully completed. The PPAR
observed that a high transport intensity has been created by price distortions
which have encouraged excessive demand for railway transport causing heavy
investments, and that efficiency gains to be made at the macroeconomic level
are probably more substantial than those at the microtechnical level since
China railways are generally efficient and technically well run.
4.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The previous Bank lending in rail-
ways in China was concentrated on augmenting the rail-carrying capacity with-
out much emphasis on institutional development. The proposed project marks a
major departure from past practice in the type of railway investments assisted
by the Bank Group. While it would continue to support major investments to
overcome the acute shortage of railway infrastructure capacity to cope with



-2-
potential traffic demands in China, it would also focus on dealing with
systemwide problems such as railway technology, operations and management. In
addition, the reform-oriented aspects would deal with two major system reforms
relating to tariff restructuring based on true costs and to prioritization of
future railway investment programs based on economic justification. It is
thus a transition from the Bank Group's part five railway projects in China,
which primarily supported specific capacity expansion investments. Over the
past few years, the dialogue between MR and the Bank has widened to cover a
large number of areas where MR needs assistance on a systemwide basis. Four
of these areas--rehabilitation of track, rehabilitation and maintensace of
locomotives and rolling stock, electrification, and telecoamunications--have
been selected as priority areas in which MR would like Bank financing in
future operations. The preparation of action and development plans in these
four areas, as well as preparation of the Railway Investment Study (RIS' to
enable MR to use modern tools to establish economic priorities, will be moni-
tored through the proposed Fifth Railway Project. Tariff reforms will also be
introduced following the implementation of the railway costing system in
accordance with an agreed plan of action between MR and the Bank. This will
ensure that tariffs would appropriately reflect real costs of operations. The
Bank and MR have agreed to include two small components for track rehabilita-
tion and for locomotive and rolling stock rehabilitation on a pilot basis to
help MR make a beginning in these two high-priority areas with systemwide
benefits. Finally, the proposed project includes two specific capacity expan-
sion components. The rationale for financing them continues to be, as in the
past, the general shortage of funds facing MR for investment needs and the
specific shortage of foreign exchange for financing much-needed components and
materials.
5.        The systemwide components and studies are intended to assist MR to
move away from the current practice of working out ad-hoc solutions to prob-
lems and instead to develop consistent, long-range, systemwide plans for
improvement and growth that better utilize scarce resources and lay the basis
for future broad-based Bank lending to China's railways. Without Bank Group
involvement, MR is likely to carry on as before, working out solutions to
problems as they arise. The result would be postponement of the development
and implementation of systemwide approaches to many areas of MR's operations,
maintenance, and management where such approaches are needed, making it more
difficult and expensive to introduce such approaches later.
6.        Proiect Obiectives.  The overall objective of the project is to
ensure that MR becomes more efficient and continues to be financially viable
through better operations, maintenance practices, investment planning, and
tariff policies. The specific objectives are to assist MR to: (a) introduce
recent developments in rail technology and maintenance and rehabilitation
practices, in order to enhance efficiency and capacity; (b) develop systemwide
plans and planning tools for its major subsectors; (c) adopt modern planning
and analytical techniques for establishing investment priorities and tariff
restructuring; and (d) add capacity where such additions are urgently needed
and justified.
7.        Prolect Description.  The proposed project would consist of (a) two
systemwide components, to assist MR to introduce recent technology and
advanced materials in the maintenance and rehabilitation of track, and to meet
the shortage of critically-needed items of material, components, and equipment
for rehabilitation of locomotives and rolling stock; (b) two capacity expan-
sion components, to complete double-tracking of the 944-km Zhegan (Zhuzhou-



-3-
Hangzhou) line, and to expand capacity at the Xuzhou marshalling yards; and
(c) an action plan for the development and implementation of the Railway Traf-
fic Costing System leading to formulation of recoumendations for tariff
restructuring. In addition, MR is currently carrying out five important stud-
ies which started during the project preparation. Four of the five studies
are technical studies which are focusing on track maintenance and rehabilita-
tion, locomotive and rolling stock maintenance and rehabilitation, electri-
fication and telecommunications: and the fifth study is focusing on the rail-
way investment prioritization.
8.        The five studies are given high priority by MR, as they will assist
it in looking at future investment requirements in a rational, systemwide
context. Furthermore, the studies would recommend investment plans in their
respective areas for the Eighth Five-Year Plan and at the same time provide
the basis for future Bank Group assistance to MR. Finally, the studies would
be linked directly to the Improvement of operational performance in their
respective functional areas since they will identify meaningful parameters of
performance, set targets for these parameters, and measure actual results
against the targets. The project would be carried out by MR and is expected
to be completed by mid-1998.
9.        The total cost of the project is estimated at $1,005.6 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of $532*1 million (53 percent).
A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts, procuremuat and disbursement methods, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B.  The timetable for key project processing events and
the status of B&nk Group operations in China are shown in Schedules C and D.
A map is also attached. A Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8439-CIA dated
August 28, 1991, is being distributed separately.
10.       Environmental Effects.  The project will have no adverse effect on
the environment. The Zhegan line double-tracking will follow existing align-
ment on go percent of the track length.  This will necessitate the resettle-
ment of about 25,000 people over the course of the project (para. 11). The
Xuzhou terminal component of the project will have a positive environmental
impact. Since 1972, MR has its own Realth and Environmental Protection
Department, which follows established rules and regulations in assessing envi-
ronmental impacts and in preventing new pollution and ervironmental hazards.
As required by the governent rules, over 60 percent of   iler, industrial and
raill_ay hospital wastewater was being treated at the end of 1988.  During
appraisal of the proposed project, an assessment of environmental issues was
made to ensure that future projects will focus on providing assistance in
environmental and waste management control.  Furthermore, at the request of
MR, a specific proposal was made by the Bank for UNDP financing in three areas
of health hazard and pollution control. These areas are (a) reduction of
noise pollution in railway factories: (b) treatment of garbage and nightsoil
in passenger trains; and (c) sterilization of passenger coaches to prevent
diseases from spreading.
11.       Agreed Actions.  The Borrower has agreed on the followingt  (a) to
be financially self-reliant under GOC's new policy, which would require that
rail tariffs should be based on costs and should be periodically revised to
ensure sufficient cash generation to cover all financial obligations and con-
-tribute 20 percent or more of its total investments during 1991-93 and 25 per-
cent or more thereafter; (b) to use, upon satisfactory conclusions of the RIS,
the analytical techniques in preparing economically optimal investment pro-



-4-
grams, to carry out the four technical studies according to agreed timetables,
to present to the Bank a report on their initial phases by March 31, 1992, and
to use the findings and recommendations for MR's future development; (c) to
develop and carry out an action plan for the implementation of the costing
system, and formulate a program for restructuring cost-based tariffsg (d) to
ensure that resettlement of the people affected by the Zhegan line double-
tracking will be carried out according to plans agreed with the Bank and that
the land will be available well ahead of the construction work; (e) to reha-
bilitate list of high-density track sections on which high-quality imported
components to be financed under the project will be installed; (f) to maintain
the availability of its fleet of imported dieeel and electric locomotives
(whose maintenance will be assisted under the project) at 82 percent; (g) to
maintain an operating ratio of 82 percent or better; and (h) to submit annual
audit reports on project subunit accounts, statement oi expenditure, special
account and MR's consolidated income statement. An understanding was also
reached that MR will rehabilitate at least 4,000 km of track annually with its
own funds.
12.       Justificetion and Risks.  The project would produce benefits in the
form of (a) extended track life leactng to longer intervals between track
maintenance activlties and thus inc tased traffic capacity; (b) greater avail-
ability of locomotives and rolling stock through the supply of critical compo-
nents and materials in short supply as well as improved workshop procedures
that would reduce in-shop time; (c) additional needed crspacity on a ma or
route and a major terminal; and (d) more cost-effective use of scarce
resources for HR, through better investment planning, while providing safe,
reliable, and economic railwr.y service to users. The estimated economic rate
of return is 33 percent for the project as a whole, con isting of 28 percent
for the permanent way system component, 25 percent for he mechanical system
component, 35 percent for the Shegan line, and 31 pet   t for the Xuzhou com-
ponent.  There is a potential risk of delay in the cc.  etion of the double-
tracking of the Zhegan line. But this component has been deferred once, and
MR has already begun implementing portions of it on its own, because of the
traffic growth in this corridor; in any case, a delay cf one or two years will
not affect the economic rate of return significantly. There are no known
risks in the other parts of the project.
13.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
