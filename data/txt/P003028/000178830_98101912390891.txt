STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE
1. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Geography, Administration and Economic Activity
Topography and Climate
1.01      Zaire (2.4 million sq km), situated astride the equator, is the
third largest country in Africa. It is bordered by nine different countries,
and has only a 30 km coast along the Atlantic Ocean. The country's only
direct access to the sea is through the mouth of the Zaire River, navigable by
ocean-going ships for about 150 km upstream to the ocean port of Matadi.
At this port, transshipment to or from rail or road is necessary because
rapids make direct transshipment between river barges and ocean-going vessels
impossible.
1.02      The geography is dominated by the Zaire River and its tributaries,
which drain virtually the whole country and provide the main traffic arteries
through some 15,000 km of navigable waterways. The climate varies greatly
between the extremes of the rather dry southeastern savanna region to the
dense, humid forest of the central basin. About one-half of Zaire is con-
sidered arable, the most productive soils being in the eastern highlands and
in alluvial lands bordering the rivers. Average annual rainfall ranges
from 2,100 mm in the north to 1,100 mm in the south.
Population
1.03      Population was estimated at about 26 million in 1977 and has been
growing at about 2.7% per annum. Average population density is about 11 in-
habitants/sq km throughout the count:ry but its distribution is uneven. There
are two axes of higher density: one axis extends west-east from the coast
via Kinshasa to Kasai Oriental, with an average of 25 inhabitants/sq km; the
second axis follows the eastern lakes in a south-north direction to the Sudan
border, and has an average of 50 inhabitants/sq km. In half the country,
however, the population density is less than 3 inhabitants/sq km. There has
been a continuing migration from rural areas to cities where about 25% of
the total population now reside.
Administration
1.04      Administratively, the country is divided into 9 regions, including
one region for the metropolitan areet of the capital city, Kinshasa. The re-
gions are further divided into 32 subregions. Because of huge distances and
poor communications, there is a neecd for administrative decentralization, but,



- 2 -
because of the continuing limited administrative capabilities of the rural
population, much power is still concentrated in Kinshasa where the central
Government is located.
Economic Activity
1.05      Central to Zaire's economy is the mining industry, which in 1976
accounted for about 20% of GDP and more than two-thirds of the
annual merchandise exports. Total budgetary revenues are extremely dependent
on Gecamines, the Government-owned mining company, which primarily produces
copper; Gecamines has contributed from 30 to 50% of t:otal budgetary revenues
annually between 1970-1975. The copper mines, located in Zaire's eastern
Shaba and Kivu regions, are distant from either ocean, and because of the high
value and sizeable volume of copper exports, their efficient transportation to
the sea is especially important.
1.06      Agriculture is the main occupation of about three-quarters of the
population, but accounted for only about 16% of GDP in 1975, and subsistence
crops represented about half of the total output. Exports of agricultural
products contribute only some 15% to total export earnings. The major export
crops are palm oil, timber, coffee, and rubber. Total volume of agricultural
exports amounted to some 320,000 tons in 1973.
1.07      In Zaire, transportation conditions exert a very important influ-
ence on economic activity. Because of the country's size, distances between
the various productive centers are long. Furthermore, Zaire's mining industry,
which is the country's most important source of foreign currency earnings, is
largely concentrated in the easternmost regions, some 2,600 km from the
country's only major seaport, Matadi. Consequently, maximizing transport
efficienev is and should be a major factor in the Government's strategy for
economic dee,Lopment.               -
1.08      Zaire's transport needs raise some important political considera-
tions. On the one hand, Government should strive to use its own transport
facilities to the maximum extent possible both to economize on foreign ex-
change spending and to minimize its vulnerability to upheavals in its nine
neighboring countries. However, in order to minimize transportation distances,
to accommodate peak transport volumes, or to reach certain destinations, Zaire
must also use transport routes through other countries and is consequently
dependent upon developments in these countries.
B. The Transport System
General
1.09      The transport modes in Zaire are highly complementary.  Zaire's
15,000 km of rivers became the main transport arteries only after railways
made it possible to bypass rapids which impeded through-traffic. Isolated



- 3 -
road systems developed in and around settlements located along the rail-
river system and still function largely as feeders to and from that system.
It was only in the late 1950s that an effort was made to interconnect the
many road systems, largely along the country's densely populated east-west
and north-south axes (para. 1.03). The highway subsector is further dis-
cussed in Chapter 2.
The Rail-River System
1.10      Rail-river transport is provided on three main axes (see Map 1):
(i)  the Voie Nationale, extending about 2,600 km
from Shaba to the Atlantic, comprising the rail-
way from Lubumbashi to Ilebo (1,575 km), the
river from Ilebo to Kinshasa (650 km), and the
railway from Kinshasa to Matadi (366 km). Total
freight carried on this route is about 650,000
tons annually;
(ii)  the north-west axis, linking the northeastern
Haute Zaire region to Kinshasa-Matadi, carrying
some 400,000 tons; and
(iii)  the north-south axis, linking the above two net-
works via the Kivu resgion, carrying some 60,000
tons.
1.11      These axes form a network of about 5,000 km of railway and about
15,000 km of navigable water with about 70 river ports. Kinshasa on the
Zaire River and Ilebo on the Kasai River are the main transshipment ports
between river, rail and road traffic. Poor organization and a lack of ade-
quate and modern equipment for the transshipments have increased current
transit times from what should be about 15 days to more than 20-25 days
on the Voie Nationale and to sometimes more than a month con the north-west
axis from Kisangani to Kinshasa.
1.12      Three other major, but external, transport routes, all by rail, link
the country's economically most important Shaba region to the sea: the Benguela
Railway through Angola to the port of Lobito; the Zambia-Tanzania railway to
Dar es Salaam; and the Zambia-Rhodesia railway to Beira in Mozambique. Because
of uncertainties in Angola and Mozambique, Zaire has become more committed to
greater use of the Voie Nationale, located entirely within the country's terri-
tory, which presently carries about 50% of copper exports from Shaba.
1.13      River transport and port operations are the responsibility of the
Office National des Transports (ONATRA); with the exception of the Matadi-
Kinshasa line operated by ONATRA, railways are handled by the Societe Nationale
des Chemins de Fer Zairois (SNCZ). Both are autonomnous state agencies under
the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Maintenance of waterways and



- 4 -
the control of navigation are the responsiblity of two other Government
agencies, the Regie des Voies Fluviales (RVF) for the inland rivers, and the
Regie des Voies Maritimes (RVM) for the Zaire River estuary between Matadi and
the ocean.
1.14      ONATRA operates the river ports and a river fleet of about 265,000
deadweight tons which carries about 1 million tons annually. It formerly had
a de facto monopoly on river traffic, but private carriers have been increasing
their share of transported tonnage (about 16% in 1976) due to ONATRA's poor
operational efficiency. ONATRA also operates the sea ports of Matadi and Boma
and, for the time being, the Kinshasa-Matadi railway which is intended to
eventually become the responsibility of the SNCZ. Transport conditions on
this important railway line have also suffered from ONATRA's general management
and financial problems, and competing road transport has taken some traffic
away from the railway. This, together with the decrease in traffic due to the
economic crisis which started in 1974, reduced ONATRA's railway traffic from
1.63 million tons in 1974 to about 1.36 million tons in 1978. The Matadi port
handles most of Zaire's direct exports and imports. With a yearly capacity of
about 1.5 million tons, it now handles about 1.2 million tons annually.
1.15      Except for the Kinshasa-Matadi line, railways are the responsibility
of SNCZ which operates a 3,606 km system in the southeast and central areas
and a 1,021 km system in the north. Track and rolling stock are in poor
condition since SNCZ lacks the funds to undertake the necessary rehabilitation,
and traffic has fallen sharply from 6.3 million tons in 1974 to 4.6 million
tons in 1977. As a result of this reduction in traffic, SNCZ's financial
situation has worsened. The organization operated at a loss of Z 6.3 million
in 1975 (in current Z), Z 26.6 million in 1976, and Z 16.4 million in 1977
despite annual tariff increases. Tariffs have just been further increased by
an average of 76%, and SNCZ's financial performance is expected to improve as
long as tariffs are permitted to keep pace with inflation.
Civil Aviation
1.16      Zaire has 33 airports served by scheduled domestic services linking
all major towns.  Kinshasa, the main airport, is served by 13 international
carriers; some international services also pass through Lubumbashi. About
150 additional minor airfields provide the basis for a comprehensive airway
system, but operations on these are hampered by the poor condition of runways,
buildings and equipment, and a shortage of qualified personnel. Government-
owned Air Zaire, the principal domestic carrier, also operates international
services.
Pipelines
1.17      Overall annual consumption of oil productS in 1975 was about
1 million tons.  The bulk of Zaire's petroleum, eitlner imported or locally
refined in Moanda on the Zaire estuary, is carrie3  via Matadi to Kinshasa by
3
two pipelines with annual capacities of 100,000 m  and 590,000 m . Before



- 5 -
the closing of the Angolan border, about 15% of the supply came via alterna-
tive routes, mainly via Lobito, providing the supply for Kivu and Shaba
regions. Expansion of pipeline capacity is under study, but its economic
justification will depend upon the speed of recovery of the Zairan economy;
preliminary estimates have indicated that construction of a new pipeline would
cost some US$50 million in foreign currency at 1978 prices. Owing to the lim-
ited capacity of the pipelines, deliveries through neighboring countries are
gaining in importance, but because of poor road conditions, distribution from
river ports and rail heads to the more inaccessible inland areas is difficult.
C. Transport Objectives and Planning
Transportation Sector Investment Objectives
1.18      Investments in the transportation sector during the coming years
will focus on the rehabilitation ancl maintenance of existing infrastructure
since these are expected to yield the earliest returns to the economy at the
lowest cost. The Government's development policy aims at furthering the
diversification of the economy to make it less dependent on copper.  This
strategy particularly emphasizes the expansion of agriculture, both to reduce
dependence on food imports and to reduce the share of mineral production in
GDP. Since agricultural production is diffused throughout the country (in
contrast to mineral production which! is concentrated in pockets), the new
emphasis on the agricultural sector implies an increasing need for and de-
pendence upon road transport. Accordingly, Government has identified a
priority road network of 40,000 km to be maintained by the Bureau of Roads (BR),
of which 28,000 km are of particular agricultural interest. The remainder
of the vast network will be maintained by local authorities as their resources
permit.
1.19      In addition, Government aims at eliminating Zaire's dependence on
neighboring countries for transport of copper and other minerals, by better
utilizing the potentially much larger capacity of the Voie Nationale. To
increase that capacity, large investments both in the rail-river system and
in port handling facilities as well as improved operations and management
would be necessary. The sizeable investments under consideration to increase
pipeline capacity (para. 1.17) would also help to reduce Zaire's dependence
on neighboring countries.
Previous and Planned Transport Investment Program
1.20      During 1972-76, Government domestic investment in the transport
sector was low, averaging only US$12 million equivalent per year. The largest
allocations were made for roads (50%) and air transport (21%).  There was no
major domestically financed investment in the rail-river system.



- 6 -
1.21      A transport investment program for 1977-1980 was prepared and
published in May 1977. This program, which mainly provides for rehabilitation
of a minimum of existing facilities, would: improve important roads in
agricultural areas; improve the Voie Nationale; faci:Litate the supply of
petroleum products to the interior; and develop urban transport. These
objectives generally appear sound, particularly since they focus on rehabili-
tating and catching up on neglected and deferred maintenance to serve agricul-
ture. However, the program failed to establish clear priorities in the light
of continuing financial constraints.
Transport Planning Authorities
1.22      Responsibility for planning is divided between the Ministry of
Finance and the Planning Commissariat which reports to the Office of the
President. Within the transport sector, intermodal planning is the responsi-
bility of the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC). MTC has estab-
lished a new Economic Study and Planning Group (GEEP) which, with expatriate
technical assistance, collaborates quite closely with the planning units in
the various government transport agencies. GEEP also studies particular
transport problems in Zaire, and this year will publish its first report on
annual transport statistics for 1977.
Bank Group Objectives
1.23      The Bank Group's strategy in Zaire's transport sector continues to
be to assist in the rehabilitation and improved maintenance of key transport
arteries and facilities which suffered neglect during the political and eco-
nomic dislocation of the 1960s and in building an effective administration
for the transport entities. In addition, the Bank Group agrees with the
Government's proposal to increase the capacity and better utilize the Voie
Nationale, where much can also be achieved by further improvement of manage-
ment and operations; a railway project which would assist in the achieve-
ment of these objectives was presented to the Board recently. In recogni-
tion of the inadequate capacity of the fuel transport system, financing of a
new Kinshasa-Matadi pipeline may also be considered once Zaire's economic
recovery gets underway. Past Bank Group-financed transport projects, other
than those for highways, are presented in Annex I; those for highways are
discussed in Chapter 2 of this report.
2. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. The Network
2.01      Until August of 1978, the country's road network, comprising about
145,000 km, was divided into two classes: (i) General Interest Roads (GIR),
totalling 69,000 km, comprising about 2,000 km of paved roads, 2,000 km of
gravel roads, and some 65,000 kmn of dirt roads; and (ii) 76,000 km of Local



- 7 -
Interest Roads (LIR), all dirt roads. This classification was only func-
tional (for administration see para. 2.09), and unrelated to the condition
of roads. On August 30, 1978, Government issued an Ordinance reclassifying
Zaire's road network into about (i) 20,000 km of National Roads (carrying
about 90% of total traffic); (ii) 40,000 km of Regional Roads (carrying about
8% of total traffic); and (iii) 85,000 km of Local Interest Roads. Since the
details of this reclassification are still being worked out by Government,
this report continues to use the o:Ld classification.

2.02       Because of the numerous rivers, the ferry system is an essential
part of the road network. At present, there are 224 established ferry
sites of which 100 are on GIR and 124 on LIR.  The present fleet consists
of 105 motorized ferries, 123 cable ferries and 32 canoe-raft (punt) ferries
(some sites having more than one ferry). It is intended to re-open another
86 ferry sites, where ferries formerly existed but are now out of operation.

B. Road Use
Vehicle Fleet
2.03      In 1975, the last year for which data are aLvailable, the vehicle
fleet was composed of about 184,000 units; some 96,000 were passenger cars,
70,000 trucks, 3,000 buses, and 15,000 other types of vehicles. There was an
average of about 7 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants, whidh varied among the
regions from 68 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants in thet Kinshasa region to 1.2
in Kasai Occidentale.
2.04      As indicated by the following table, from 1969 to 1975 the average
annual growth rate of the vehicle fleet was about 9%, but from 1975 to 1978,
growth has been estimated at only 3%. This slower rate was due to the coun-
try's lack of foreign exchange which reduced vehicle imports.

Fuel Consumption
2.05      Fuel consumption increased at an average amnual rate of about 8%
from 1969 to 1974, and only 2% from 1974 to 1977. B3ecause of the energy
crisis, consumption of both gasoline and diesel oil .in 1974 remained almost
unchanged and in 1975 increased by about 5%. In 1976 and 1977, however,
consumption of gasoline did not increase (probably because of the foreign
currency shortage) whereas that of diesel oil increased by only about 1.5%
and 3% respectively.

Traffic Growth
2.06      The latest complete countrywide traffic count was executed in
1959. Thereafter no counts were taken until 1969, and since then traffic has
been counted irregularly and only on specific roads, as part of feasibility
studies for road improvements, or more recently in the case of Bas Zaire and
Bandundu, as part of the Third Highway Project's maintenance and rehabili-
tation pilot schemes. The only available countrywide record of traffic is
the ferries' vehicle registers, which are unreliable. However, a traffic
study carried out in 1978 by BR under the Association's Third Highway Project
estimates that average daily traffic (ADT) on the GIR network in 1977 was as
follows:
Length     % of Total
(km)     Road Network
-    exceeding 100 vehicles per day (vpd) on        2,000           3

Road Transport Industry
2.07      In 1978, the road transport industry was in the hands of one large
haulage firm which operated more than 100 vehicles, and a large number of
small operators, many of them driver-owners of a single vehicle. In addition,
some government agencies operate vehicle fleets of more than a hundred vehicles
for carrying their own goods. Only the large company and the Government
agencies comply with operating regulations (described in para. 2.21). Smaller
operators, who are more adaptable to the conditions prevailing in the sector,
have increased their share of the road transport market. Half of all transport
in Kinshasa and most transport within rural areas are undertaken by individual
carriers. Inter-urban transport, however, is still dominated by the larger
companies. The Zairanization of the transport industry in 1974 resulted in a
rapid deterioration of transport services. In 1976 the previous owners were
reinstated and transport services have improved somewhat but have not yet
reached their pre-1974 level because the lack of foreign currency prevents the
modernization and proper maintenance of the vehicle fleet. The situation
should be closely monitored and, if necessary, a project to help the trucking
industry should be considered.
C. Administration
2.08      Before 1971 the responsibility for roads rested with the Department
of Roads and Bridges in the Ministry of Public Works. The department was
poorly staffed, and the training and experience of most of its staff were
inadequate. The situation was particularly critical in the regions, and the
department had virtually ceased to function in many areas, resulting in the
progressive deterioration of the highway network after the country became
inde?endent .
2.09      Under the First Highway Project, consultants recommended the
creation of an autonomous agency, with its own source of funds and independent
of the Ministry of Public Works, to assume responsibility for 22,000 km of the
most important roads. In 1971, the Government created this agency in the form
of the Bureau of Roads (BR) with responsibility for improving and constructing,
maintaining and rehabilitating roads, bridges and ferries; recurrent and capi-
tal funds continued to be allocated from the national budget. Initially all
GIR (69,000 km) were placed under the Bureau's jurisdiction, and in 1972 its
responsibilities were extended to include all urban roads as well. However,
the Bureau's scope was again altered recently, and its responsibility was
limited to 40,000 km of priority roads.
2.10      Under the Second Highway Project, a contract was signed in 1972
with the Association Internationale Zaire Routes (AIZR), a consortium
composed of three consulting firms, Louis Berger International (USA), BCEOM/
SCET (France) and Research and Development (Belgium) to furnish technical
assistance to the Bureau; in all, 47 positions were provided. This assis-
tance was supplemented by experts provided under various bilateral aid pro-
grams. Despite this substantial technical assistance, progress in creating



- 11 -
an effective highway administration remained slow as a result of: (i) a
shortage of qualified Zairan personnel at all levels; (ii) frequent restruc-
turing of BR and changes in the scope of its responsibilities; (iii) the
absence of a consistent highway sector policy and consequent lack of rational
investment and operational planning; (iv) insufficient funds for road re-
habilitation, maintenance and administration; (v) difficult logistic problems
of road maintenance, aggravated by the delayed arrival of equipment under the
Second Highway Project; and (vi) tlae somewhat unsatisfactory performance of
consultants.
2.11      In 1974, however, the situation in the Bureau began to improve.
Almost all maintenance equipment provided under the Second Highway Project had
arrived in Zaire and was being used for maintenance of 20,000 km of priority
roads. In the same year, more than 2,000 km of priority roads were rehabil-
itated and more than 700 local highway personnel were trained and assumed
functions in all branches of the Bureau. These factors, combined with the
closer project supervision made possible by the presence of the Bank's Resident
Mission in Kinshasa, made it reasonable to expect continuing improvement in
the Bureau, and there was cause for optimism when the Third Highway Project
was appraised in mid-1974. Shortly thereafter Zaire's financial crisis began,
resulting in shortages of both local and foreign funds needed for the continua-
tion of BR's rehabilitation and maintenance activities. In spite of this,
however, maintenance has substantially improved in Bas Zaire where the Third
Highway Project has been concentrated.
2.12      BR's present organization (see Chart 1) is appropriate and it could
maintain the roads now under its responsibility, if the necessary operational
funds were provided on a timely basis. However, a law, No. 78-008, issued in
January 1978 concerning the decentralization of Government could be interpreted
to give the provincial governors authority over the management of BR. Since
this could adversely affect the efEiciency of BR's operations, it was agreed
during negotiations that as a condition of Credit effectiveness, legislation
satisfactory to the Association would be adopted to assure that BR has full
control over its assets and the management of its day-to-day operations
(para. 5.02).
2.13      BR employs about 10,700 local employees:  3,600 permanent employees,
of whom 250 are in managerial positions, and 7,100 paid on a daily basis.
Among its staff, most of whom still need training, there are about 160 engi-
neers and 120 technicians. During implementation of the proposed project, BR
will also employ 60 expatriate experts, 50 for the maintenance and rehabilita-
tion programs, 6 for the ferry program, and 4 for the National Laboratory
(AnnexII).  These experts will work in either staff or advisory positions,
varying from general manager to mechanic. During the next three years, as
national counterparts become available, Government intends to reduce the
number of expatriates employed. Agreement was reached with Government that
during project execution, appointments to senior positions in the BR will be
acceptable to the Association (para. 5.01(i)).
D. Training
2.14      Considerable training of BR's highway personnel has been, and still
is, carried out under IDA-financed highway projects, other international and
bilateral aid programs, and at various local institutions. Since 1972 about



- 12 -
1,300 BR employees at all levels have undergone courses in highway admin-
istration and engineering, or on-the-job training for equipment operators
and mechanics. Since 1975, an important part of the technical training has
been carried out within a mechanized road maintenance training unit which was
specially created for this purpose. This unit is supervised by three foreign
experts and two local trainers who provide (i) 3 months of on-the-job training
to engineers and (ii) 9 months of' formal instruction and on-the-job training
to technical staff to be assigned to other mechanized units. Although the
training program has been quite successful, the numbers which have been
trained are still inadequate for BR's needs. Between 1978-81 it is hoped
to train a further 1,500 employees at all levels and about 40 domestic train-
ers; to do so, Government has drawn up a satisfactory training program which
will be carried out at its existing training center at Kasangulu near Kinshasa
and at two centers to be established at Kongolo and Bukavu.
E. Planning
2.15      Highway planning, including the preparation of cost estimates
and economic justification, is the responsibility of an Economic Unit which
was recently attached to BR's Construction Department. The plans prepared by
this unit are first to be submitted to the GEEP (para. 1.22) for intermodal
planning, and subsequently as part of the Transportation Plan are incorporated
into the National Plan.
2.16      Although the above planning procedure appears satisfactory, there
are serious practical constraints, the most important being (i) the scarcity
of reliable data which renders planning by even the most qualified experts
mere guesswork and (ii) the difficulties of establishing priorities between
road maintenance and construction. The matter is further complicated by the
country's great needs compared to its limited financial and institutional
resources, and the lack of coordination among the various external sources of
financial and technical aid. Moreover, Zaire's present critical economic and
financial situation, and the consequent difficulty in determining the amount
of funds available for roads for the years to come have made budgeting and
execution of programs more and more problematic.
2.17      In view of the recently adopted policy to direct development to
the agricultural sector in particular (para. 1.18) and to improve the eco-
nomic and political integration of the country, Government is giving priority
to road transport over other transport modes, to foster internal trade and
exploitation of national resources other than mining. Government has formu-
lated a broad road maintenance and rehabilitation program for 1979-81, pre-
pared by BR in close cooperation with the Ministries of Planning and Agricul-
ture. The three-year plan provides for:
(i) a capital investment program, including:



- 13 -
(a) construction of 30 bridges and procurement and
installation of 11 motor and 54 cable ferries;
(b) rehabilitation of 1,000 km of paved roads;
(c) procurement of highway maintenance equipment;
(ii)  a maintenance program for 28,000 km of roads indispensable for
agricultural development and 12,000 km of the country's main road
axes, comprising:
(a)  mechanized routine and periodic maintenance
of 2,000 km of paved roads, 2,000 km of gravel
roads and 18,000 km of earth roads; 1/
(b)  manual routine maintenance of 18,000 km of earth
roads; 1/ and
(c)  maintenance of bridges and ferries.
This program, which represents the absolute minimum to serve the country's
agricultural needs is effectively the comprehensive highway maintenance plan
to be submitted by Government according to Section 4.04 (b) of the Credit
Agreement for the Third Highway Project. The proposed project will assist
Government in undertaking this program (para. 3.04). Furthermore, as an
aid to future highway maintenance planning, Government has agreed to prepare
by September 30, 1980 a plan for road improvement over the period 1982 through
1986 (para. 5.01(ii)).
F. Financing
2.18      Sources of financing for the road program are:
(i)  BR's own current budget for recurrent expenditures,
provided by:
(a)  the Ministry of Finance through monthly czontri-
butions equal to 1/12 of the annual allocation
provided in the country's ordinary budget; and
(b)  quarterly contributions from the fuel taxes col-
lected by Petro-Zaire; and
(ii)  the investment budget which reflects capital iexpendi-
tures from both the Government's own and foreign aid
resources.
1/   In some instances includes minimum rehabilitation so that routine
and/or periodic maintenance can be undertaken.



- 14 -
BR has direct control over expenditures from its current budget, and this
arrangement operates satisfactorily. However, it has no control over ex-
penditure from the investment budget which is administered directly by the
Finance Ministry. This has caused frequent problems for BR when contractors
are not paid on time. The financing of BR's capital costs was discussed with
Government, and agreement was reached on improved payment procedures for
contractors engaged by BR, through the establishment of a quarterly payment
procedure similar to that presently provided for BR's current budget (para.
5.01(iii)). Agreement was also reached with Government that BR's accounts and
financial statements for each fiscal year during the project period will be
audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Association. The financial
statements so audited will be submitted to the Association not later than six
months after the end of each fiscal year (para. 5.01(iv)).

These expenditure levels were inadequate for the saitisfactory protection of
BR's investments. Between 1974 and 1977, recurrent expenditurea on roads
declined in real terms; although it increased slightly in 1978, it was still
36% below the real value of recurrent expenditure in 1974. Real capital
expenditure, mostly supported by foreign contributions, increased through 1975
but subsequently declined. These trends are indicative of Zaire's difficult
economic climate; the situation is even more serious when the erosion of the
country's external purchasing power due to the declining value of its currency
is taken into consideration.



- 15 -
2.20       Road users' contributions were sufficient to cover all of BR's re-
current expenditures and about 30% of its capital expenditures in 1976 (see
Table). However, the real value of these contributions declined by about 65%,
and in 1976 road user contributions also declined in absolute terms principal-
ly because of import restrictions and a consequent drop in import duties.
Government is presently considering increasing the real level of road user
contributions in order to ensure that BR receives a direct and regular source
of finance.

G. Engineering
2.21       BR's Construction Department is responsible for road design, but
its own staff carries out only minor work; foreign consultants are employed
for major and complex work. Geometric design standards, which were established
under the Second Highway Project, are adequate (Annex III). Traffic regulations
permit axle loads of up to eight tons. However, these regulations are not
enforced, and frequent overloading is the case, leading to faster road dete-
rioration and making road maintenance more costly. Agreement has therefore
been reached with Government that a plan of action for the enforcement of
vehicle axle-load limits will be furnished to the Association prior to
December 31, 1979 (para. 5.01(v)).

2.22      The National Laboratory (Laboratoire National des Travaux Publics -
LNTP) is managed and operated by the French consultants, CEBTP.1/ Its main
task is to test materials and soils for civil works, and in particular for
road construction. At present the Laboratory is focusing on research of local
materials suitable for use in civil works, especially in r^a  c          -    - -.
maintenance. Because of the Government's lack of foreign exchange, however,
the Laboratory, whose earnings are in local currency only, could no longer
procure equipment and pay expatriate staff's salaries. Thus under the Third
Highway Project, IDA agreed to finance some additional equipment and the
cost of four expatriates through 1978. The proposed project would continue
financing of equipment and technical assistance to permit the National Lab-
oratory to carry on its important and necessary task (para. 3.06, item A.V.).
H. Construction
2.23      Foreign contractors generally carry out major construction, and
supervision is usually done by foreign consultants. Although contracts are
in accordance with procurement procedures prescribed by the financing agency,
administrative procedures for their execution are cumbersome, causing long
delays between award and notification of contracts and thus leading to price
increases. Agreement was therefore reached that Government will take the
necessary steps to simplify the administrative procedures for contract notifi-
cation (para. 5.01(vi)). There are about 15 foreign-owned road construction
firms, all of them locally registered. The few domestic road builders lack
the experience, skilled staff, and capital for equipment, to execute major
road work. BR has recently begun to successfully carry out some road improve-
ment by force account, where bids by private firms were too high.
2.24      Because of a shortage of funds, there has been little scope for
major road constr;.ction work, and this situation is likely to continue for
some time. Although there is an apparent surplus of contracting capacity
in Zaire, which would be expected to result in low unit prices, unit prices in
the country have remained high. This may be partly explained by the fact that
contractors are sometimes not paid on time (para. 2.18).
I. Road Maintenance
2.25      Road maintenance declined after the country's independence in 1960.
Maintenance equipment and vehicles were not available because of military
action, and spare parts, tools and skilled personnel were scarce.  To overcome
the many organizational and financial difficulties of the first years of
independence, the Government, with the assistance of the United States Agency
for International Development (USAID) and the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP), introduced the. system of "conventions routieres". Under
this arrangement, maintenance was contracted out to agricultural and industrial
enterprises which had a direct interest in maintaining permanent connections

et des Travaux Publics.



- 17 -
to and from markets.  About 20,000 km of gravel and earth roads were thus
maintained, largely manually, at a minimum level to keep them open to traffic.
The Government also occasionally engaged locally registered contractors for
mechanized road maintenance. But, because it was difficult to adequately
specify the amount of work to be done under recurrent maintenance, disputes
between BR and the contractors frequently arose about the quality of mainten-
ance obtained under the contract. When USAID discontinued its assistance in
1972, the Government had begun to rebuild its own mechanized force and related
services, with technical assistance provided under the IDA-financed First
Highway Project, and was able to take over maintenance from those contractors
whose performance was unsatisfactory.
2.26      In 1977, BR programmed road maintenance operations over almost
50,000 km of roads, but due to its lack of funds, fuel and spare parts, only
about 60% of the program was carried out. BR had a similar experience in
1978 when road maintenance operations were carried out on about 28,000 km of
the network. Even so, the work accomplished by the BR in 1977 and 1978 rep-
resents a substantial improvement over maintenance operations in the early
1970s.
2.27      BR's maintenance and rehabilitation program particularly emphasizes
a pilot scheme in Bas Zaire, and a similar scheme is being prepared for
Bandundu. Both schemes form part oi. the Third Highway Project. The pilot
scheme in Bas Zaire covers 3,200 km, or almost 85% of the region's entire
primary network. It was designed, so that BR could acquire experience in road
maintenance, including staff training, and then use this experience to expand
its activities gradually to the other regions. Bas Zaire was selected first
because of (i) its high road density, (ii) social and economic importance,
and (iii) easy logistics due to the proximity of the port of Matadi. There has
been substantial improvement in Bas Zaire's road network, although execution
of the scheme, which began in mid-1975, has progressed slowly because delivery
of equipment was delayed, and Government lacked the foreign exchange for spare
parts and fuel.
2.28      At present BR has about US$41 million worth of equipment, which is
maintained and repaired by the Workshop and Warehouse Department (Service de
Gestion du Materiel des Travaux Publics-SGMTP). Equipment is operated by 38
self-contained mechanized units of which 7 are in Bas Zaire, 7 in Bandundu,
and 24 in the rest of the country. The composition of the mechanized units
is adequate in Bas Zaire, but less satisfactory in Bandundu and in the other
regions. Because of the lack of spare parts and fuel, and in the outlying
regions, logistics problems, average utilization of equipment in 1977 and 1978
was extremely low. To permit BR and IDA to monitor this situation closely,
appropriate targets for equipment utilization were agreed with Government
(para. 5.01(vii)).
2.29      In view of Government's financial constraints, BR should not expand
its organization and operations, but should concentrate on improving its effi-
ciency and productivity by better utilizing what it already has. Therefore,



- 18 -
the proposed highway project is confined to improving maintenance and reha-
bilitation activities initiated under the previous three highway projects,
rather than introducing new activities. Furthermore, in view of the contin-
uous shortage of spare parts and fuel caused by a lack of foreign currency and
the resulting equipment underutilization, Government wishes to reduce mecha-
nized maintenance and to improve its manual road maiintenance operations. It
has therefore proposed that a position should be created in BR, to be filled
by an expatriate provided under technical assistance or a qualified national,
who would review present manual road maintenance practices, and recommend
improvements including proposals on appropriate teclnology. Agreement has
been reached that such an expert will be appointed by Government and financed
under the project (para. 5.01(viii)).
J. Maintenance and Operation of Ferries
2.30      Zaire's ferry system is an essential part of the road network, and
its efficient operation and reliability are necessary if road traffic is to
be assured. This is particularly true for transport of agricultural products,
many of which are perishables. Ferry maintenance has declined since indepen-
dence, and many ferries have ceased to function. In 1971, when BR was created,
only about 180 ferries out of the 330 then existing were in operation.
Following the recommendations of a 1976 study carried out by the Organization
for Rehabilitation and Training (ORT) and financed under the Third Highway
Project, BR decided to reorganize the Ferry Department in order to improve
ferry operations. The SMB (Service Mecanisation Bacs) was therefore estab-
lished to repair, maintain and operate the ferries as well as to construct
simple cable ferries. It presently runs three shipyards and three mobile
repair units and in 1977, it repaired and maintained 60 ferries, replaced five
engines, and constructed one tug boat. The Third Highway Project is assisting
in the fino-71ing of SMB's work program, and the proposed croject v'ould continue
this assistance (para. 3.04(iii)) in order to build ll the capacity of SMB Lo
anable it to gradually service the entire ferry system.  Tn order to monitor
utilization of the ferries, agreement was reached with Government on ferry
availability targets (para. 5.01(ix)).
K. Past and Ongoing Assistance to
the Highway Subsector
Past Assistance
2.31      Since Zaire became independent in 1960, the Association has helped
finance three highway projects. In 1969, the First Highway Project assisted
the Government to prepare a program for improvement of the highway administra-
tion, and executed an emergency maintenance and rehabilitation program. The



- 19 -
project cost of US$9.6 million was fi'nanced by IDA Credit 152-CK (US$6 mil-
lion), UNDP (US$1.6 million), and Government (US$2 million). The Credit
financed technical assistance to the highway administration, procurement of
equipment, spare parts, and tools, and some maintenance and rehabilitation
work. According to the Project Completion Report of this project (1976), only
part of the expected objectives were satisfactorily achieved. The creation
of the Bureau of Roads as an autonomous agency has resulted in a visible
improvement of highway administration. Rehabilitation and maintenance work,
however, did not produce the expected results mainly because of an overly-
optimistic project timetable, the Bank Group's lack of knowledge of the
country, the prevailing disorder of Zaire's administration, and its lack of
familiarity with Bank Group procedures. The project was completed in 1976,
four years after the planned closing date. A Bank Group audit of this project
has been completed which supported the conclusions of the Project Completion
Report.
2.32      The goal of the Second Highway Project, approved in 1972 and now
substantially completed, was to help the Government strengthen the Bureau
of Roads, to train local staff, and to rehabilitate about 1,900 km of gravel
roads. The Project cost, originally estimated at US$46.4 million, and later
increased to US$59 million, was financed by IDA Credit 292-CK (US$19 million),
UNDP (US$2.2 million), USAID (US$9.8 million), the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) (US$4 million), Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation
(FAC) (US$1 million) and Government (US$23 million). The IDA Credit financed
technical assistance to BR and rehabilitation work. Further strengthening of
BR has been achieved, notwithstanding some rather unsatisfactory performance
of the consultants. Rehabilitation work, however, has progressed very slowly;
work has encountered many difficulties such as cost increases, shortage of
Government's funds, and Zairanization of contractors. As a result, only about
1,000 km were rehabilitated to planned standards; 600 km were finished to
standards lower than originally envisioned, and the remaining 300 km were
deleted from the project.
2.33      The Third Highway Project, approved in 1975, is mainly intended to
continue strengthening BR and developing local expertise in highway adminis-
tration and to rehabilitate about 600 km of gravel roads. The project also
provides for the implementation of a pilot scheme in the Bas Zaire region
with later extension to the other regions (para. 2.27). The project cost,
estimated at US$40.3 million, is financed by IDA Credit 536--ZR (US$26 mil-
lion), UNDP (US$0.9 million), FAC (US$0.7 million), Belgium (US$0.2 million),
and Government (US$12.5 million). The IDA Credit finances (i) procurement of
equipment, tools, and spare parts; (ii) road rehabilitation, including super-
vision of these works; (iii) construction of workshops, (iv) technical assist-
ance, and (v) feasibility studies for future road construction. The maintenance
and rehabilitation pilot scheme in Bas Zaire, started in mid-1975, progressed
well after delivery of the new equipment. The pilot scheme in Bandundu
began last year.  As intended, old equipment has been transferred to Bandundu
from Bas Zaire, and an organization to maintain and repair this equipment has
been set up.

2.34      As a result of Zaire's financial crisis of 1974 the Third Highway
Project, like other Bank Group-financed transport projects in Zaire, en-
countered significant problems because of shortages of both local funds and
foreign currency for capital and recurrent expenditures. Because of the
March 1976 devaluation of the Zaire from Z 1.00 = US$2.00 to about US$1.16, 1/
the domestic cost of all foreign currency expenditure nearly doubled, and fuel
costs increased even more. Implementation of the project, which requires a
large Government-financed current budget for maintenance and rehabilitation,
placed an especially heavy burden on the Government"s overall budget. In
response to these unforeseen financial difficulties, project amendments
to the Third Highway Project were proposed in the President's memorandum to
the Board dated March 20, 1978 (ref. IDA R78-25). The amendments reduce the
project component for road rehabilitation and feasibility studies and concen-
trate upon financing the most essential road improvements, fuel, spare parts,
and the introduction of a ferry maintenance program. The amendments also
ensure that the extension of intensive road maintenance to the Bandundu area
can proceed as envisaged. This will help to continue the gradual improvement
of Zaire's highway maintenance operations.
3. THE PROJECT
A. Background
3.01      Because of Zaire's difficult financial situation which will con-
tinue for se-eral years to come, and because the Government's emphasis upon
agricultural development calls for a comprehensive approach to maintaining
and rehabilitating the road network, it would be desirable if the Fourth
Highway Project could constitute the total 3-year program of BR's maintenance
and rehabilitation activities. With this approach the estimated cost of the
project would include BR's total capital and current expenditure over this
period, in both local and foreign currency as itemized in Annex IV.
3.02      However, the available cofinancing is inadequate to finance the
full three-year program. It is therefore proposed to finance a two and a
half year time slice of this program, to follow on the Third Highway Project
which is almost completed. Due to the delay in finalizing the agreement
with Government concerning the proposed project, IDA approved an advance of
US$1.0 million under the Project Preparation Facility to enable the technical
assistance to BR to continue without costly interruptions in the technical
assistance contract.
1/   Further devaluations have occurred since 1976; the present exchange rate
is about Z 1.0 = US$0.65.

B. Objectives
3.03      The objectives of the proposed project support Government's overall
transport objectives and are a continuation of those of the three previous
IDA-financed highway projects, namely: strengthening of highway administration;
improvement of road maintenance, rehabilitation and betterment work; and
further development of local expertise and experience at a:Ll levels. Because
of Zaire's difficult economic and financial conditions, the project emphasizes
the protection of existing investment by maintaining roads at a reasonable
level of serviceability, as opposed to an emphasis on upgrading or expansion
of the road network.
C. Project Description
3.04      On the basis of the above considerations, the proposed project is
a two and a half year time slice of BR's three-year Road Maintenance and
Rehabilitation Program (para. 2.17), and covers:
(i) Routine and periodic maintenance and, where necessary,
rehabilitation of 28,000 kma of roads indispensable for
agricultural development, and of the most important
12,000 km of the country's main road axes with particular
focus on the road networks of the Bas Zaire and Bandundu
regions; this entails:
(a) construction and equipping of two workshops and
warehouses;
(b)  procurement of equipment to permit BR to
carry out maintenance itself where main-
tenance by contractor has proven to be
unsatisfactory;
(c) replacement of worn-out existing equipment;
(d)  procurement of spare parts and fuel for
rehabilitation and maintenance work; and
(e) technical assistance to the BR and the SGMTP,
and related training.
(ii) Rehabilitation and strengthening of about 800 km of
paved roads;
(iii) Repair and replacement of ferries comprising:



- 22 -
(a)  the procurement of materials to construct 11
motor ferries and 45 cable ferries, and pro-
curement of 48 ferry motors, 51 ouI:board motors,
spare parts and tools;
(b)  the construction of workshops and warehouses;
(c)  the construction of 11 ferry access ramps; and
(d)  technical assistance to the SMB for the training
of mechanics and SMB operators.
(iv)  Strengthening and where necessary replacement of about
25 bridges, which will replace inadequate ferry
crossings, or obsolete or weakened bridges.
(v)  Improvement of the LNTP by providing needed equipment and
technical assistance.
D. Cost Estimates
3.05      The total cost (capital and recurrent) of the road maintenance program
amounts to about US$231.3 million equivalent, of which US$44.8 million equivalent
is needed in 1979, US$95 million equivalent in 1980 and US$91.5 million equivLlent
in 1981. Capital costs amount to about US$143.3 milliLon (US$136.5 million net of
taxes) with a foreign exchange cost component of aboul: US$102.7 mnillion. Recurrent
costs over the period total some US$88 million, with al foreign exchange cost
component of about US$23.8 million.

Note:  This table is based on the document  Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program of Bureau of Roads for 1979-1981," prepared by BR in December  977.  The following
modifications have been made:  (i) the BR January 1977 prices have been updated to June 1979 prices by increasing the foreign currency componenr by 30% and the
local currency by 60% which correspond to the amount of inflation experienced by BR for its specific activities;  (ii) the percentages of foreig  cost have been
increased to show the foreign cost to the Zaire economy instead of to the BR only; (iii) the 10% quantity contingency included in the BR progra  is shown separately
for the capital cost; and (iv) for future years, the same inflation percentages for local and foreign currency have been used, assuming that th depreciation rate
of the zaire will closely follow the local inflation rate.  The following average percentages were applied to all project components:

3.06      Cost estimates are based on estimates provided by BR and are given
in June 1979 prices. A 10% physical contingency included in BR's capital
cost program is shown separately in the cost table. The cost estimates
prepared by BR have been examined by the mission and found to be realistic.
They are derived as follows:
A.   Capital Investment:
I.   Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program
(i)  Construction of two workshops and warehouses:
estimates of local, foreign and total costs are
based on unit prices for similar work in Zaire;
(ii) procurement of equipment, machine/hand tools,
vehicles, spare parts, and fuel: estimates
are based on recent bid prices. The foreign
component is based on the c.i.f. cost (Matadi),
and the local component includes local handling
and transport costs; and
(iii) technical assistance: estimates are based
on actual costs for the same services rendered
under the Third Highway Project. The average
billing rate, estimated at US$8,100 per man-
month, including salary, housing, internal and
external transport, and insurance, is reasonable.
II.   Rehabilitation of about 800 km of Paved Roads
Estimates are based on quantities resulting from a
study carried out by the LNTP and on unit-prices
received on recent bids.
III.   Ferry Program
(i)  Construction of ferries:  procurement of
engines, steel plates, angle iron, timnber,
materials for assembling, and labor:
estimates are based on unit costs and quanti-
ties developed by BR's Ferry Section, which
took into consideration current prices of
materials and labor and recent bids. The
foreign component of all items, except for
labor and for timber produced locally, is
based on the c.i.f. cost (Matadi);
(ii) Procurement of outboard motors, engines, spare
parts, machines and tools, vehicles, radio
equipment:  estimates are based on unit
prices quoted by suppliers in Kinshasa, and
on recent bids. The foreign component
is based on the c.i.f. cost (Matadi), and the
local component includes handling and trans-
port costs;

(iii) Construction of workshops and warehouses:
estimates of local, foreign and total costs
are based on prices quoted by local builders
for similar work; and
(iv) Technical Assistance: estimates are based
on actual costs for the same services rendered
under the Third Highway Project.
IV.   Bridge Program
(i)  Estimates for bridge elements are based on
recent supplier quotations. The foreign
cost element covers c.i.f. cost to Matadi; the
local cost element covers local transport and
assemblage.
(ii) estimates for abutments are based on approximate quantities
and on unit prices received on recent bids.
V.   Laboratory
(i)  Procurement of equipment:  estimates are based
on unit prices quoted by suppliers in Kinshasa,
and on recent bids. The foreign component is
based on the c.i.f. cost (Matadi), and the local
component includes local handling and transport
costs; and
(ii) Technical Assistance: estimates are based
on actual costs for the same services rendered
unn.er the Third Highway Project.
R.RecT_rrent EYxtend:ture
Estimates are based on an assessment of quantities of materials,
fuel, etc. required for the maintenance program. Unit prices are
derived from recent supplier quotations, and, in the case of
salaries, on BR's actual salaries paid in 1977 and updated to 1979.
The cost of contractor maintenance is based on contractor rates
updated to 1979.
E. Financing
3.07      The financing plan for the project is shown on page 27.  The total
foreign currency cost of the project is US$126.5 million equivalent. In
addition to the proposed IDA Credit of US$26.0 million, and the US$0.6 million
included in Credit 660-ZR (Cotton Rehabilitation Program, 1976), cofinancing
totalling US$82.7 million is potentially available from the Saudi Fund (US$33.9
million), KfW (US$23.6 million), the EEC Special Action Fund (US$15.5 million),
CIDA (US$6.5 million), ODM (US$2.2 million), USAID (US$0.7 million), FAC
(US$0.2 million) and AGCD (US$0.1 million). 1/ The co-financing from all

aid agencies and Governments with the exception of US$7.0 million from KfW,
US$3.0 million from CIDA and US$33.9 million from the Saudi Fund is already
secured. Credit effectiveness will be conditional upon the effectiveness of
the Saudi Fund Loan Agreement and the EEC Special Action Fund Credit (para.
5.02).
3.08      Government's contribution to project financing is estimated at
US$98 million in local currency and US$24 million in foreign currency.  During
the remainder of 1979, its contribution to the projec:t will amount to US$22.2
million equivalent of which US$4.1 million will be required for foreign
expenditures. For 1980 Government's contribution will total US$48.0 million
with US$9.7 million for foreign expenditures, and finally for 1981, Govern-
ment's contribution will total US$51.8 million with US$10.2 million for
foreign expenditures. Government has agreed to provide no less than US$40
million equivalent for BR's recurrent expenditures of which US$3 million will
be in convertible currency during each year of project execution and, by October 31
of each year during project execution, to exchange v:iews with the Association on the
adequacy of proposed budgetary allocations to BR for the followiLng fiscal year
(para. 5.01(x)).
3.09      A large part of the existing equipment fleet is presently either
immobilized or ineffectively utilized because of a shortage of spare parts and
fuel. Financing of the year-by-year increments in foreign exchange expendi-
tures for fuel and spare parts will be conditional upon the Government in-
creasing its maintenance expenditures as agreed.
F. Implementation
3.10      BR will be responsible for project implementation.  Agreement was
reached with Government on a work program for the first year of the three-
year program (para. 5.01 (xi)). The work program lists the roads to be
maintained, the paved roads chosen for rehabilitation and the bridges and
ferries chosen for rehabilitation or replacement. A rate of return of 15% is
the minimum overall economic return which will be acceptable for the project
items. Agreement was also reached with Government that similar work programs
for the second and third years of the program will be prepared and submitted
to the Association for consideration prior to the be;ginnng of each year's
program (para. 5.01 (xi)). A project implementation schedule (Chart 2) and
project reporting procedures, including the submission of a project completion
report not later than six months after the Closing Date, were also discussed
and agreed upon (para. 5.01(xii)). BR has been requested to report progress
of project implementation on a quarterly basis. BR, with the proposed amount
of technical assistance, should be able to execute the project satisfactorily.
G. Procurement
3.11      The following procuremebnt procedures will be applied to those
project elements for which IDA-financing is provided. Construction of the
workshops and warehouses as well as ferry access ramps and bridges will be
entrusted to local contractors under unit price contracts through competitive



- 29 -
bidding advertised locally because the construction sites iare located through-
out the country and each individual contract amounts to less than US$400,000
and is therefore not suitable for International Competitiv,e Bidding (ICB).
Machine/ handtools, vehicles, spare parts, all materials, engines and equipment
will be procured through ICB if the items can be combined in lots exceeding
US$100,000. Otherwise such items will be procured locally through comparative
shopping. Strengthening of paved roads will be entrusted to contractors under
unit price contracts through ICB. Fuel will be procured from private suppliers
at the rates set by Government. Technical assistance will be procured through
renewal of existing contracts which the Government has with ORT for the
Workshop and Warehouse Department and Ferry Section, and with individual
experts for the other positions. 1/ Procurement of those items to be financed
under the EEC Special Action Fund Credit will be carried out in accordance
with EEC procurement guidelines.
H. Disbursements
3.12      Disbursement of the IDA Credit would be made as follows:  100% of
foreign cost for spare parts, fuel, materials, ferry equipment and technical
assistance; and 65% of total cost of road rehabilitation and construction of
workshops, ferry access ramps, and bridge abutments. The proceeds of the EEC
Special Action Fund Credit will be disbursed as follows: 100% of foreign cost
for spare parts, equipment and technical assistance and 80% of local cost for
road rehabilitation and bridge abutments.

4. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.01      About three-quarters of Zaire's population of over 26 million depends
on agriculture for its livelihood, principally through small-holdings widely
dispersed throughout the country. Largely due to poor transport facilities,
over 50% of the agricultural outpult is subsistence crops.  Adequate road
transport for the evacuation of produce is necessary for the achievement of
the Government's policy objective of (i) increasing agriculture's share of GDP
by sustaining and expanding cash crop production both for internal and external
markets; and (ii) reducing imports of foodstuffs.
4.02      The current poor condition of the road network not only leads
to high vehicle operating costs but, in many cases, renders roads impassable
for long periods during the rainy season. Unserviceable and unreliable
ferries greatly aggravate the problem. Thus production of cash crops is
discouraged, not only through high transport costs but even more so because
frequently impassable roads and unreliable ferry services cause supply routes
to be unreliable. Better road maintenance and improvement of ferry services
to be financed under the program would reduce these obstacles to cash crop
production. The rural population in general and farmers in particular would
be the principal beneficiaries.
4.03      Even before Independence, Zaire's road system was of a low standard.
In the decade following Independence, lack of human and financial resources
resulted in neglect of road maintenance, and caused serious deterioration of
the road network. Although in the early 1970s the situation started to improve
with the creation of BR, the 1974 economic decline and the resulting financial
crisis has caused the maintenance effort to slow down through inability to
procure essential spare parts, fuel and materials, and deterioration of the
highway network has accelerated. The present situation, therefore, is that
BR has a significant quantity of maintenance equipment immobilized for want
of essential spare parts, which in turn has an adverse effect on the efficient
utilization of costly foreign technical assistance.
B. Area of Influence of the Program
4.04      The provision of spare parts, fuel and technical assistance is
intended to assist Zaire's highway maintenance program as a whole, and is not
directed towards any particular locality. However, one project component,
the rehabilitation of paved roads, will particularly influence the Bas
Zaire and Bandundu regions, since practically all of Zaire's older paved roads
are located in these regions. The paved roads proposed for rehabilitation
constitute the principal axes linking the seaport of Matadi with Kinshasa at
the terminus of the navigable river system, and from there with the interior



- 31 -
of the country. The rehabilitation of these main axes will permit the alloca-
tion of spare parts and fuel to other regions where these are indispensable
for the continuation of a minimum maintenance program. Such a program is
necessary to protect the basic road infrastructure, essential to the economy
of the regions, against further deterioration, which in many cases could lead
to total closure of the roads.
4.05      Bridges and ferries are widely dispersed throughout Zaire and
benefits from the improvements to river crossings will theriefore also be
widespread. The bridges and ferries in the regions provide essential transport
links for local traffic over extensive areas as well as for longer-distance
through-traffic. Moreover, for transport of agricultural produce, particular-
ly perishables, they are absolute necessities.
C. Economic Analysis 1/
Rehabilitation and Strengthening of Bitumen Roads
4.06      Most of the 2,000 km of paved roads in Zaire have not had any
periodic maintenance for many years, and are in very bad condition.  If the
rehabilitation proposed under the project is not undertaken soon, many roads
will be completely closed. It should be recognized that, unlike earth and
gravel roads, bitumen paved roads cannot be kept passable by graders, and
vehicle operating costs on a paved road in poor condition may be even higher
than on an earth road. Furthermore, since these roads carry much heavier
traffic, this results in a substantial economic loss.
4.07      The 94 km Kibangu-Tshela ro.ad with traffic of 340 vpd and in an
advanced state of deterioration illustrates the type of road rehabilitation
which is required over the paved road network. The benefits would arise from
voc savings since it is estimated thalt, without the project, voc on this road
would rise to the equivalent of those on a poor earth road over the life of the
proposed project. Traffic, which on paved roads is assumed to be comprised of
two-thirds heavy vehicles and one-third light vehicles, is forecast to grow at
5% per annum. VOC on these roads are as follows:
Vehicle Operating Cost
Iight Vehicle           Heavy Vehicle
(US$ equivalent per km)
Bitumen roads - current condition            .28                    .52
Bitumen roads - deteriorated condition    .35                       .65
Earth roads - good condition                 .53                   1.00
1/   Because of incomplete data, the economic evaluation of the project
components is based on illustrative examples.



- 32 -
4.08      The investment costs represent the rehabilitation to be carried
out under the project and light resealing after seven years.
4.09      The streams of costs and benefits, set down in Annex V, Table 1
indicate a benefit/cost ratio oI about 4.i:i for the Kibatu6u--sneLa roac, WIt.
discounted at 15%. The corresponding economic return is 53%. Sensitivity
analysis indicates that if costs are 20% higher and benefits 20% lower thail
assumed in this case, economic returns still do not fall below 39%. Due to
the high traffic levels and deteriorated condition along most cf the paved
network, it is expected that any road selected for rehabilitation will be
similarly justified.
Spare Parts and Materials for Highway Maintenance Program
4.10      The economic return on the financing of additional equipment, spare
parts, materials, and fuel will, owing to its incremental nature, be substan-
tial. In the absence of detailecl traffic data, the evaluation has been carried
out assuming both 15 and 20 vehicles per day (vpd). Traffic comprising
two-thirds heavy vehicles and one-third light vehicles is estimated to increase
at 5% per annum. Incremental annual maintenance costs include both capital
and recurrent expenditures. Additional equipment is estimated to have a
useful life of six years under normal use and maintenance. Therefore the
evaluation period corresponds to this 6-year life. BR's past performance
indicates that in the absence of the project it could maintain about 28,000 km
of earth roads. However, with the project a further 10,000 km of earth roads
will be maintained. Benefits from the project are therefore calculated as the
voc savings due to the improvement to "good" condition of 10,000 km of dirt
roads now in "poor" condition.
4.11      Because of lack of data as to what may be expected with respect
to generated traffic, it is further conservatively assumed that benefits
will consist exclusively of savings in vehicle operating costs (voc) for
normal traffic which yields weighted average voc savings of US$0.22 per
vehicle-km calculated on the basis of the following voc:
Vehicle Operating Cost
Light Vehicle           Heavy Vehicle
(US$ equivalent per km)
Earth road - good condition                .53                    1.00
Earth road - bad condition                 .60          ].29
4.12      In addition there will be considerable time savings, which have
not been quantified for lack of basic data, as well as unquantifiable social
benefits resulting from better administration, health services, etc.



- 33 -
4.13      The resulting streams of quantifiable costs and benefits have
been discounted at 15%, the estimated opportunity cost of capital in Zaire, to
give a benefit/cost ratio of 1.4:1 for only 15 vpd. The corresponding economic
return for 15 vpd would be about 67% (see Annex V, Table 2).
Replacement of Ferries
4.14      The motorized ferries to be selected for renewal will replace
obsolete ferries. They are to be located on main highway axes and thus are
part of interregional links. Failure to replace these ferries would necessi-
tate the diversion of interregional traffic by indirect routes, often via
poorly maintained roads, resulting in higher journey costs. Where such
alternative routes do not exist, a decline in economic activity in the area
served by the ferry would result. Therefore, these ferries are to be justi-
fied either on the basis of the distance saved by having a shorter route
between centers, or by avoidance of loss of economic output. Where alter-
native routes do exist, it is estimated that, as an average, savings of a
total of 550 vehicle-km per day would be sufficient to justify a ferry re-
placement based on the assumption that standards on the alternative diversion
route are equivalent to those of a good earth road. Ferry operating costs
include replacement of engines after 8 years, careening after 10 years, and
recurrent maintenance and cost of operations.
4.15      The evaluation of specific ferry replacements will, of course,
depend on whether the ferry is already out of service, or the date at which
it is estimated that the existing ferry will become unserviceable. An example
is taken of Isangi ferry in the Haut Zaire Region, where prompt replacement
is necessary. Benefits would arise from avoiding extra voc on the alternative
earth road to Kisangani which is 60 km longer than the direct route via
the ferry. Given a conservative estimate of 12 vpd at the ferry, potential
daily distance savings are 720 km. Traffic comprising two-t:hirds heavy
vehicles and one-third light vehicles is estimated to grow at 5% per annum.
Other operating assumptions are as in para. 4.14 above.
4.16      If it is assumed that some traffic would have been deterred by the
additional length of the journey, potential voc savings would be correspond-
ingly less.  But on the other hand, benefits equivalent to the value of
economic output foregone would be lost. In the case of the Isangi ferry,
a variety of assumptions are made as to the proportion of traffic that
would be deterred if the ferry were to go out of service, ranging from zero to
50%.
4.17      The cost and benefit streams are shown in Annex V, Table 3.  The
estimated benefit/cost ratio varies between 2.1:1 and 2.7:1 and the correspond-
ing economic returns between 37% and 55%, depending on the assumed proportion
of deterred traffic. Sensitivity analysis showed that, even with increased
costs of 20% and decreased benefits of 20%, the economic rate of return for
the ferry ranges between 23% and 32%. The Isangi ferry can probably be
regarded as an extreme case in view of' the low vpd and relatively small
potential distance saving. The economic justification for other ferries
likely to be selected for inclusion in the project can be expected to exceed
this level.



- 34 -
4.18      Motorized ferries and cable ferries also have a very important
local economic and social role to play. Many towns are traversed by rivers,
making ferries the indispensable internal link for the homogenous community
settled on both banks of the river. In the rural areas, cable ferries are
indispensable elements of the road network, and thus essential to the market-
ing and processing of agricultural products over extensive areas. Failure
to replace obsolete cable ferries will therefore discourage production of
market crops, and conversely induced production can be expected to result
from installing ferries at new sites. The economic effects, as well as the
social benefits, vary from one ferry to the other and can only be evaluated
after an individual study of each case. Considering the poor condition
of most ferries, timing of decisions as to repair or replacement is likely to
be determined more by actual breakdowns, rather than hypothetical priority
calculations.
Bridge Program
4.19      The United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany have given
a grant of about US$2.2 million and a loan of about US$1.1 million respectively
for the procurement of Bailey bridge elements to enable Government to carry
out a bridge program as part of its 1979-1981 highway maintenance plan.
4.20      The program will inclucde the replacement or strengthening of
obsolete or weakened bridges. The economic rate of return for one such
bridge which averages 20 vpd is shown in Annex V, Table 4. The detour in
the absence of the bridge in this case is 140 km. Assuming a 50% traffic
deterrent rate and a good earth road, the rate of return is still about 95%.
In many cases, the detour routes are longer and either of much lower standards
or even impassable.
4.21      The program further includes the replacement of either motor or
cable ferries by bridges. Rate of return calculations for representative
motor and cable ferry replacements are presented in Annex V, Tables 5 and 6
showing economic returns of 39% and 35% respectively. An important benefit
due to the replacement of these ferries is the increiased reliability of
river crossing. The vehicle cost savings shown in the case of the motor
ferry assume that the ferry cannot operate 10% of the time and that 50% of
deterred traffic detours and takes a good earth roacd.  In the case of the
cable ferry, a 20% out of operation rate is assumed., This may be due to
a combination of weather or tidal conditions as well as mechanical and
technical factors.  Again, it is assumed that 50% of' the traffic detours
on to good earth roads. As the ferries to be replaced are amongst the least
reliable and/or most heavily used, these assumptions are at least realistic
if not conservative.
Laboratory
4.22      The economic benefits of the investments for technical assistance
and equipment for LNTP have not been quantified. However, by providing



- 35 -
information on the location and suitability of road construction and road main-
tenance materials, the laboratory plays an important role in reducing the
cost of construction and maintenance operations. The economic benefits of
the relatively small investment will therefore be substantial.
Aggregate Economic Rate of Return
4.23      The aggregate economic reLte of return for the maintenance, paved
road, motor ferry and bridge components is 55%. The rate of return for each
component was considerably increased when a shadow exchange rate of US$1=Z 2
was used. This aggregate rate of return excludes the laboratory component
amounting to under US$1 million, equipment renewal (US$28.5 million), and the
provision of ferry access ramps, equipment, workshops and motors as well as
technical assistance and training amounting to about US$21 million, for which
the benefits could not be meaningfuLlly quantified.
D. Risk
4.24      In view of the very high economic rates of return for most of the com-
ponents, the risk of misallocation of resources is minimal. The major risks
which could obstruct the successful completion of the project would be the
failure of Government to provide its share of the funds. However, Government
is strongly committed to improvement of the road network and has already
undertaken to provide its share of the funds needed to carry out the project.
Should it become apparent that insufficient funds are available for project
completion, a balanced reduction in project scope will have to occur. However,
even in this case the returns on the individual components which are carried
out will still greatly exceed the opportunity cost of capital.
5. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01      Agreement was reached with Government on the foLlowing:
(i)  during execution of the project, appointments to senior
positions in the BR will be acceptable to the Associa-
tion (para. 2.13);
(ii)  preparation by Government by September 30, 1980 of a
plan for road improvement over the period 1982 through
1986 (para. 2.17).
(iii)  Government will set up an improved payment procedure
for contractors engaged by BR, through the establishment
of a quarterly payment procedure into BR's capital fund
similar to that presently provided for BR's current
budget (para. 2.18);



- 36 -
(iv)  BR's accounts and financial statements for each fiscal
year during the project period will be audited by inde-
pendent auditors acceptable to the Association. The
financial statements so audited will be submitted to
the Association not later than six months after the end
of each fiscal year (para. 2.18);
(v)  a plan of action for the enforcement of vehicle axle-
load limits will be furnished to the Association prior
to December 31, 1979 (para. 2.21);
(vi)  procedures for notification of contracts will be simpli-
fied (para. 2.23);
(vii)  appropriate targets for equipment utilization (para. 2.28);
(viii)  an expert will be appointed by Government to review present
manual road maintenance practices and recommend improvements
including proposals on appropriate technology (para.
2.29);
(ix)  ferry availability targets (para. 2.30);
(x)  Government will provide no less than US$40 million equivalent for
BR's recurrent expenditures of which US$3 million will be in
convertible currency during each year of project execution and,
by October 31 of each year during project execution, Government and
the Association will exchange views on the adequacy of proposed
budgetary allocations to BR for the following fiscal year (para.
3.08);
(xi)  the agreed work program for the first year of the
three-year program will be carried out and similar
work programs for the second and third years of
the program will be prepared and submitted to the
Association for consideration prior to the begin-
ning of each year's program (para. 3.10); and
(xii)  a project implementation schedule and project re-
porting procedures including the submission of a
project completion report not later than SiX months
after the Closing Date (para 3.10).
5.02      Credit effectiveness will be conditional upon the adoption of the
legislation referred to in para. 2.12, and the effectiveness of the Saudi
Fund Loan Agreement and the EEC Special Action Fund Credit (para. 3.07).
5.03      With the agreements outlined above, the project is suitable for an
IDA Credit of US$26.0 million on standard terms to the Government of Zaire and
an EEC Special Action Fund Credit of about US$15.5 million.

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
REPIJBLIC OF ZAIRE
Past Bank Group-Fvinanced Transport Projlects
1.        Bank Group involvement in the transport sector has so far been
limited to the highway (see Chapter 2) and the rail-river subsectors.  Two
projects have been financed in the rail-river subsector and are still under
supervision.
River Transport Credit (Credit 255--ZR, June 1971, US$7.0 million)
2.        The project consists of urgent rehabilitation works (for the river
navigational infrastructure and for ONATRA's river fleet), and provision of
experts needed for the reorganization of the river agencies. The main institu-
tional reforms, which were requirecd as a condition of the Credit were initi-
ated, and the two autonomous agencies, RVM (Regie des Voies Maritimes) and RVF
(Regie des Voies Fluviales), were set up to maintain water ways and control
navigation. In spite of continuing difficulties, the agencies are fulfilling
their functions and carrying out rehabilitation of the principal waterways,
although at a rate less than anticipated. The third beneficiary agency of the
Credit, ONATRA has performed poorly with respect to project objectives due to
the general ineffectiveness of its management. With the recent infusion of
new management, it is now expected that performance will be improved, princi-
pally under the follow-on Credit 57'1-ZR, Railway and River Transport Project.
Railway and River Transport Project (Credit 571-ZR, July 1975, US$26.0 million)
3.        This second project was aimed at improving ONATRA's efficiency and
productivity and continuing support of RVF. Finance was mainly provided for
continuing rehabilitation of navigation aids, technical assistance, training,
provision of river transport equipment (buoy tender, shop boat, and barges),
railway equipment, and preliminary engineering studies for the proposed
Kinshasa-Ilebo railway link. Results thus far are disappointing, and the
project is behind schedule in many respects. Considerable delays have been
incurred in filling the technical assistance positions, and in procurement of
river craft. Although the procurement of other equipment is progressing
satisfactorily, no improvement in operations effectiveness has yet been
achieved. The financial position of ONATRA has been stabilized and improved
under the new management. With the ongoing buildup of an increased management
team, provided by Belgian Technical Assistance in addition to technical
assistance under the Credit, improvements are now expected in the operational
areas, particularly river transport and the supporting shipyard.

Railway Transport Project (Board Presentation May 1979 - US$20.0 million)
4.        This project will assist Government in carrying out its long-range
program of track rehabilitation and operational improvements, and includes:
(i)  the renewal and upgrading of 210 km and ballasting
a further 285 km;
(ii)  the purchasing of new wagons, shunting locomotives
and passenger coaches;
(iii) improvement of Ilebo port facilities;
(iv) provision of spare parts for existing equipment; and
(v) technical assistance and training.
Total project cost is estimated at US$161.5 million and cofinancing has been
secured from the Saudi Fund, KfW, ADB and the OPEC Special Fund.

Note:  This table is based on the document "goad Mainrenance and KehaDilitation Program of Buredu  of Roads    1'9719l,"  prcpared by   L'R in Deet.ber 1977.  The follcving modifiations
have been made:  (i) the BR January 1977 prices have been updated to June 1979 prices by increasing the foreign currency component by 307% and the local currency by 607c which
correspond to the amount of inflation experienced by BR for its specific activities; (ii) the,percentages of foreign cost have been increased to show the foreign cost to the
Zaire economy instead of to the BR onlly; (iii) the 107 quantitv contingency included in the BR program  is shown separately for the capital cost; and (iv) for fulture years, the
same inflation percentages for local and foreign currency have been used, assuming that the depreciatios rate of the zaire will closCly follow  the local inflation rate.  The
following average percentages were applied to all project co.ponents:
