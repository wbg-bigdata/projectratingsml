FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
Health Sector Transition Project
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:               Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
Beneficiary:            Ministry of Health (MOH), National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), National Institute
of Public Health (NIPH) and selected district health facilities.
Credit Amount:          SDR 11.8 million (US$16.9 million equivalent)
Tenns:                  Standard IDA; 35 years, including 10 years grace.
Project Obiectives:     The dual objective of the Health Sector Transition Project (HSTP) is to: (i) improve the
health of the population by enhancing the quality of basic health services; and (ii) support
an initial phase of policy reforms to increase cost-effectiveness, fiscal sustainability and
patient choice within the health system.
Project DescriDtion:    Project objectives will be achieved through activities under the following three
components, each designed around a core policy agenda:
(i) Health Finance and Management (base cost US$3.8 million): The objective is to build
capacity to analyze and apply information for policy-making and health system
management. Support will be provided fortechnical studies, strengthening of management
skills in the MOH, NHIF and health facilities, and the development of management
information systems.
(ii) Basic Health Services (base cost US$7.0 million): The objective is to strengthen
primary health care and health promotion, particularly in rural areas. Support will be
provided to equip rural primary health care centers, upgrade skills of primary care
personnel and supply essential materials to five high-priority disease prevention programs.
(iii) Pharmaceutical Policy and Supply (base cost US$5.7 million): The objective is to
reduce the cost of essential drugs through reforms which create a more competitive
pharmaceutical market. Essential drugs for primary care will be provided, along with
technical advice, training and equipment to improve public procurement, reimbursement
and quality control.
Total project cost is estimated at US$ 19.4 million equivalent (including contingencies).
This includes US$ 0.9 million to support establishment of an International Project Unit
(IPU) within the Ministry of Health (MOH) responsible for coordinating the
implementation of project activities. The Project will be implemented over three years
by the Ministry of Health and associated health institutions.
Project Benefits:       The economic benefits of the Project include better quality basic health services and a
more cost-effective use of public resources for health--both of which will counteract the
negative impact of recent economic and fiscal contraction on the health of the population.
Health Finance and Management: This component provides economic and fiscal benefits
through its impact on the allocation of public resources for health. It will result in a
reallocation of public resources toward more cost-effective health interventions, as well
as limitation of health expenditures to fiscally sustainable levels. The component



ii
implements a basic benefits package for health insurance based on cost-effective treatment
of national health priorities, and tailored to available resources. It also creates incentives
for efficiency and quality of care, through the establishment of new provider payment
mechanisms; and improves resource management through strengthening of managerial
skills and provision of management tools.
Basic Health Services:  Cost-effective reduction in the burden of disease, through
improved preventive and curative primary care, is the major economic benefit of this
component. With continued high levels of infant mortality due to infectious diseases and
maternal mortality due to high-risk pregnancies, as well as rapidly rising premature
mortality due to chronic diseases associated with unhealthy lifestyles, it is clear that
preventive and curative primary care is the most cost-effective way to reduce multiple
elements of the burden of disease. The component will result in adequately staffed and
equipped rural primary health care centers, and more effective reduction of the leading
causes of infant, child, maternal and other premature mortality through support for
national prevention programs.
Pharmaceutical Policy and Supply: The benefits of this component lie in its economy-
wide impact on the price of essential drugs, as well as the direct provision of essential
drugs for more effective primary care. Provision of drugs will be linked to reforms aimed
at increasing the affordability and availability of essential drugs. Legislative and
regulatory reform will ease market entry and create incentives to market lower-cost
drugs. Reform of public sector procurement and reimbursement procedures will lower
unit costs for drugs, and channel public resources toward more cost-effective drugs. The
economic and fiscal gains of the component far outweigh its economic costs, with fiscal
savings in the three-year period conservatively estimated at ten times the investment cost.
These large economic and fiscal benefits will continue beyond the life of the Project.
Prolect Risks:          The Project faces two key risks--one political, the other institutional. The political risk
is that the country cannot muster the political will necessary to implement fundamental
health sector reform, particularly with respect to limiting insurance benefits, squeezing
economic rents out of the pharmaceutical market and consolidating the public sector
facilities network. Government has only the health care consumer on its side, facing
powerful medical and pharmaceutical interest groups. To reduce this risk, the following
strategy has been pursued. First, technical working groups with broad stakeholder
participation were formed at an early stage for strategy formulation and project
preparation. Second, the project preparation team engaged in early interaction with the
media. Third, early efforts were made to market the emerging reform strategy to key
economic policymakers. Finally, and most importantly, resources have been included in
the Project to support a vigorous communications strategy, in order to inform and
persuade major stakeholders.
A secondary risk lies in the weak institutional capacity of the MOH, and its limited
experience in implementation of internationally funded projects. The MOH has a direct
staff of only 25, with mostly medical--as opposed to managerial--training. To alleviate
this risk, the Project will invest heavily in building managerial capacity within the MOH
and NHIF, as well as supplementing implementation capacity by providing local
management consultants to support the IPU. Although the reform agenda supported by
the Project is substantive, project investments are simple, and organized into a small
number of procurement packages. Medical equipment and drugs accounting for more
than 40 percent of the IDA credit will be procured by a local agent with sophisticated
infrastructure and a strong track record of international purchasing and local distribution.

I. HEALTH SECTOR BACKGROUND
A. Introduction
Economic and Political Context
1.1            Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia), the poorest republic in the
former federated state, has spent the five years since independence struggling to avoid internal conflict
and gain full political and economic recognition from the international community. The country has been
forced to address structural problems in the economy which it inherited from Yugoslavia, while external
forces--notably regional conflict, trade embargo and transport blockade-- severely constrained economic
performance. As a result, real income dropped by nearly 40 percent between 1990 and 1994, to an
estimated per capita GNP of only US$790 in 1994. The deterioration in living standards has been
exacerbated by an inevitable fiscal crisis, which has undermined the social safety net and provision of
social services. Now, with tentative resolution of the regional conflict, and lifting of the trade embargo
and transport blockade, FYR Macedonia can begin to move beyond the crisis stage, deepening the
structural reforms necessary for resumption of growth. Key to the success of economic reform and to
long run economic growth will be provision of a fiscally sustainable social safety net and the effective
development of human capital.
Health Status, Services and Financinrg'
1.2            By Central and Eastern European (CEE) standards, FYR Macedonia has a young
population and relatively high fertility rate, resulting in positive population growth. During the 1960-90
period, the population enjoyed steadily improving health status, with rapidly declining infant and maternal
mortality. The infant mortality rate dropped from 112 per 1,000 live births in 1961 to just 28 in 1991,
with life expectancy rising from 61 to 72 years. Since the advent of the transition, improvement in health
status has stagnated--a key issue for health sector reform, as discussed below. Although life expectancy
in FYR Macedonia falls below that in established market economies (EME) countries, it equals or exceeds
that in other CEE countries and far surpasses that in developing countries at similar income levels. While
life expectancy is on par with higher income CEE countries, the determinants differ considerably. Infant
mortality in FYR Macedonia is twice the CEE average, while premature adult death due to chronic
disease and injury is far lower. In short, the country is not as far along in the demographic and
epidemiologic transition as other CEE countries--with both positive and negative implications for health.

1.3             Real income growth was not the sole determinant of improving health status in past
decades. The health system also made a positive contribution, offering universal coverage, broad risk-
pooling, wide access to facilities, abundant and relatively well-trained personnel and effective public
health activities, such as immunization  and vector control.   FYR  Macedonia inherited a highly-
decentralized and locally-funded health system (based on the former "Self-managed Communities of
Interest") which tended toward fragmentation, duplication and interregional inequities in the quality of
care. The country was divided into 33 districts (five in the capital, Skopje), each of which had its own
network of facilities which were "socially owned" by health workers and communities. In 1994, these
socially-owned facilities were converted into a single network of public sector health facilities under the
supervision of the MOH. The 33 districts remain, with 17 medical centers (each a complex of secondary
hospital and outpatient polyclinic) and associated primary health care (PHC) centers. The country also
has 14 disease-specific or chronic care treatment hospitals, as well as a university complex of tertiary care
facilities in Skopje. The public sector network consists, on average, of a PHC center per 6.,000
inhabitants and a general secondary hospital per 110,000 inhabitants. Private health services were
authorized in 1991, and have grown most rapidly in pharmaceuticals (wholesale and retail) and dentistry,
where private expenditures tend to be concentrated.
1.4             To overcome regional inequities in the quality of care, and maximize risk-pooling for a
population of only 2.1 million, the district health insurance funds were unified into a centralized National
Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) in 1991. Reimbursement of private health services by NHIF, as well as
the development of private health insurance, were also authorized at that time. Despite decentralized



financing in the past, the insurance system had uniformly offered universal coverage and a comprehensive
benefits package (preventive, curative, rehabilitative and chronic care), with no out-of-pocket costs. The
insurance system was, and is, financed predominantly through payroll contributions equaling 8.6 percent
of gross wages (payroll contributions as a whole--not including personal income tax--equal 31 percent of
gross wages).  Health insurance contributions from  the active labor force (wage earners and self-
employed) have provided around 60 percent of public revenues for health in recent years, with an
additional 23 percent from the Pension and Unemployment Funds to cover pensioners and registered
unemployed. Approximately 15 percent of revenues derive from user fees and other sources, and another
2 percent from the central budget, to cover MOH administrative costs and support national disease
prevention programs.  Public expenditures for health (not including cash transfers for sick pay) have
fluctuated at around 7-8 percent of GDP in the past four years, contracting roughly in proportion to the
economy. This contraction in spending--35 percent in real terms since 1990--has undermined the quality
and availability of basic health services, and given great urgency to the need for structural reform in the
financing and provision of health services.
B. Issues for Health Sector Reform
Preventable Burden of Disease
1.5            FYR Macedonia has succeeded in long-run improvement of health status, but continues
to suffer from a burden of disease which is largely preventable through cost-effective interventions at the
primary level. Two areas merit particular attention. Infant mortality (at 28 per 1,000 live births in 1991)
remains twice as high as the average for CEE countries, and three times the average for EME countries.
The long-term downward trend in infant mortality stagnated during the early transition, reflecting general
socioeconomic decline and the breakdown of basic health services-'. Approximately 40 percent of infant
deaths occur after the first month of life, largely as a result of infectious diseases. More than one quarter
of infant mortality is attributable to diarrheal disease and acute respiratory infection--both preventable or
treatable through cost-effective primary care.  High-risk populations (generally poor, rural and/or
members of ethnic minorities) in FYR Macedonia have infant mortality rates of 40 or more, and a larger
share of infant deaths due to infectious disease and malnutrition. These high rates reflect differences in
maternal education, as well as more high-risk pregnancies and lower rates of prenatal care, attended births
and immunization coverage among these populations. More effective health promotion, prenatal care,
nutrition education and clinical services for maternal and child health are needed at the primary level to
further reduce infant mortality.
if Recent declines in the infant mortality rate result from a sudden and implausible 30 percent decline among certain high-risk
populations, which is likely to be attributable to declining participation in vital registration, rather than a significant improvement in
health status.

1.6           The second area of concern is the long-term buildup in premature death due to chronic
diseases associated with unhealthy lifestyles. FYR Macedonia is beginning to see chronic disease death
rates usually seen in far wealthier, post-industrial societies. This is particularly true for cardio- and
cerebrovascular diseases, which are by far the leading causes of premature death in both men and women,
and are associated with risk factors such as high-fat diet, lack of exercise, smoking and alcohol
consumption. Stress and social dislocation associated with the economic transition have undoubtedly
exacerbated this situation. Age-standardized death rates for cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases are 20-
40 percent higher than in much wealthier neighboring countries such as Greece and Italy, and are rising
toward the extreme levels seen in countries such as Hungary and Poland. Age-standardized rates for
other leading causes of death for men (lung cancer, liver disease) and women (breast cancer, stomach
cancer) are still below most EME countries, but rising steadily. Improvement in health status in FYR
Macedonia has ground to a halt during the transition as a result of trends in infant mortality and death
due to chronic diseases. If the country does not use health resources more cost-effectively for primary
and secondary prevention, it may soon face the worst of both worlds: infant mortality rates reminiscent
of developing countries and death due to chronic disease on par with wealthy post-industrial countries.

1.7               Adiustment to declining resources. Between 1991 and 1995, public revenues for health
declined by 40 percent in real terms, and have shown no sign of recovery. This decline is the result of
roughly proportional econornic contraction and a shrinking payroll tax base, as socially-owned enterprises
reduced wage payments and employment, emerging private enterprises evaded fiscal obligations and
statutory budget transfers were unfulfilled. The magnitude of the resource decline would have dramatic
consequences in any health system. In FYR Macedonia, ad hoc adjustment in spending resulted in the
virtual elimination of all capital expenditures and slashing of recurrent expenditures for personnel, drugs,
medical supplies and maintenance. This ad hoc adjustment was far from optimal, exacerbating long-
standing misallocation of resources. Personnel expenditures fell by 45 percent in real terms and drugs by
40 percent or more (partially compensated in some years through humanitarian aid), with similar spending
cuts across-the-board. Despite the cuts, arrears in the health sector have mounted to MKD 1.4 billion by
end-1995.

1.8             While critical operating and investment expenditures have been cut, no fundamental
restructuring of the public sector health network has occurred. As with other socially-owned enterprises,
health facilities have protected employment at the expense of real wages and working capital. To an even
greater extent than in other socially-owned enterprises, public health facilities have not been restructured
or liquidated, but rather have limped along in a largely inoperable state for lack of working capital. The
combination of poorly paid personnel and shortages of critical drugs and medical supplies has undermined
productivity and the quality of care--particularly at the periphery. Even core public health functions, such



- 7 -
as childhood immunization, are at risk. In 1992, measles immunization coverage fell from over 90
percent to only around 60 percent--with measles epidemics following in 1993-94. Although humanitarian
assistance has temporarily shored up the immunization program in recent years, it is clear that the health
system needs to adjust to reduced public resources--but in ways which do not jeopardize the health of the
population.
1.9           Poor capacity utilization. With 2.4 physicians, 5.5 nursing staff and 5.4 beds per 1,000
population, staffing ratios and inpatient capacity in FYR Macedonia are on par with EME countries. This
is in contrast to many former socialist countries (e.g., Bulgaria, Russia) which have egregious excess
capacity. Nonetheless, FYR Macedonia cannot afford EME standards, and existing capacity in the system
is poorly organized and recent events have reduced demand for health services and shifted basic care up
the network to less cost-effective levels. Decentralization of health financing and management in the past
led to separate district networks of health facilities, with considerable fragmentation and duplication of
services. District secondary hospitals generally have catchment areas which are too small, and have
dramatically different ratios of physicians and nursing staff to occupied beds--implying widely varying
standards of care for similar acute care needs. Many specialized hospitals were established for treatment
of chronic diseases which today can be handled more efficiently in a general acute care or outpatient
setting.

1.10         The breakup of the Yugoslav Federation and the economic impact of transition rneant a
loss of non-Macedonian patients in the system, as well as reduced national demand resulting fror, redu, ed
income, increased out-of-pocket costs and dissatisfaction with the lack of drugs, supplies and eqL6prn!_nt.
In 1991, the hospital referral system was abolished, allowing patients to seek care at any level of the
system. In search of higher quality care, patients have since moved up the hierarchy, flooding high-cost
hospital services with basic primary care needs. As a result, the average number of consultations per day
for a general medicine physician dropped from 20 in 1990 to 10 in 1993. Hospital occupancy rates are
low, with rates in secondary hospitals which serve populations of over 100,000, averaging only 59
percent in 1993. At the same time, at the Department of Medical Faculty in Skopje--the top of the health
network pyramid--patient admissions from outside Skopje increased by 40 percent between 1991 and
1993, and occupancy rates remain around 100 percent.
1.11         Occupancy and utilization rates are low for all but tertiary care facilities, despite average
lengths of stay (ALOS) which are high and rising. In contrast to a sharply declining international trend,
in FYR Macedonia ALOS has remained between 14 and 18 days for the past decade. For most of the
major diagnostic categories, ALOS in FYR Macedonia are two to four times longer than in the United
Kingdom (see examples below). Thus, the system has both excess capacity and poor utilization of
capacity--inefficiencies which existing health financing mechanisms fail to squeeze out.

1.12         Lack of fiscal sustainability. Like most socialist health systems, that of FYR Macedonia
had offered universal coverage for a comprehensive benefits package with no out-of-pocket costs. Since
1991, modest progress has been made in limiting public sector liability to finance health services. The
Health Protection Law adopted in 1991, and amended in 1993 and 1995, has begun to trim the benefits
package provided under compulsory national health insurance, and introduce copayments and user fees
for insured services. Services such as cosmetic surgery, thermal baths and certain prosthetic devices are
no longer reimbursed through the NHIF. The law also establishes the right to purchase supplemental
insurance for broader coverage, and the obligation to pay out-of-pocket for services not covered by
insurance. The 1993 amendment introduced copayments on insured services, ranging from 10 percent
for hospitalization to 50 percent for certain drugs and supplies. However, copayments are subject to
broad exemptions (children, the elderly, pregnant women, chronic disease patients) which undermine both
their revenue and incentive purposes. While some progress has been made to limit public sector liability,
it has obviously been insufficient to ensure fiscal sustainability, and has not involved a reallocation of



- 9 -
public resources toward the most cost-effective health interventions. A process is needed to identify
health priorities, based on the national burden of disease, and evaluate cost-effective strategies for
addressing these priorities. Coverage and reimbursement rates under the basic benefits package would
then need to be further limited, within the envelope of expected resources.
1.13          Lack of incentives for efficiency and quality of care. The financing mechanisms currently
in place offer no incentives to control costs, increase efficiency and improve quality. The NHIF relies
on input-based budgeting (staff, beds) to allocate funds to public sector facilities, without regard for
service volume, efficiency or quality. This budgeting system is a fallback method, following the
breakdown of an earlier "German-style" points system. A lack of cost accounting in public sector
facilities prevented the accurate valuation of points, rendering the system increasingly irrelevant. While
technically still in operation, the points system currently serves no allocative purpose. The existing
budgeting mechanism transfers no financial risk to providers, and, therefore, provides no incentives for
efficient behavior.  The lack of appropriate payment mechanisms also prevents the NHIF from
reimbursing private providers, despite its legal mandate to do so.  Thus, not only does the
underdevelopment of provider payment mechanisms fail to provide explicit incentives to public sector
facilities, but it also hinders privatization and private sector development which would offer competition
to the public sector.
1 .14         Inadequacy of managerial skills and tools. Despite past decentralization of the system,
many decisions (e.g., staffing ratios, wage levels) were centralized or made by the community council.
The managerial function--with managers taking risks and reaping the rewards of autonomous decision-
making--was nonexistent. Today, the MOH is committed to increasing managerial autonomy within an
appropriate regulatory framework, but facility directors tend to be physicians with no management
training. They also have little relevant information on which to base decisions, and few staff with the
necessary capacity to analyze information for decision-making. Health facilities lack a modem cost
accounting system, and there is little integration of medical and financial information needed to evaluate
efficiency and effectiveness. A systematic assessment of data needs has not been undertaken, nor a
strategy developed for the collection and use of data to improve health system management.
Poor Oualitv Services
1.15          Breakdown of primary health care. The quality and availability of PHC services have
deteriorated severely in recent years, particularly in rural areas. More than 40 percent of the population
resides in rural areas, and tends to be older and poorer than the general population. In the most isolated
border districts, the elderly constitute 10-19 percent of the population. The PHC budget is integrated in
the allocation to the district medical center--with rural PHC centers at the bottom of a budgetary hierarchy
which includes both the general hospital and outpatient polyclinics. Thus, the contraction in resources
has pinched hardest at the periphery. Separation of budgetary allocations and financial accounting for
hospital care, primary care and pharmacies is a badly-needed first step in clarifying financial priorities.
In a survey of 247 rural PHC centers, one quarter of those in need of a full-time physician were without
one. Virtually every center surveyed lacked some basic equipment for routine examination, minor surgical
intervention, sterilization and waste disposal. For example, around 30 percent lacked blood pressure
gauges and stethoscopes; 70 percent lacked infant scales and refrigerators; 90 percent lacked an otoscope
or a padded examination table. All were without health promotion materials. PHC staff are also too
narrowly trained, with doctors and nurses lacking a broad preventive and curative approach to family
medicine. Particularly damaging has been the lack of essential drugs at the primary level--a result of poor



- 10 -
procurement, distribution and reimbursement policies in the public sector.
1.16           Obstacles to affordable drugs. At an estimated three percent, the share of national income
spent on drugs in FYR Macedonia is extremely high by global standards. Approximately half of this
is financed by the public sector. For a small set of tracer drugs (all of which were common, essential
primary care drugs), it was found that market prices in public and private pharmacies in FYR Macedonia
were five to twenty times world market prices--a differential unjustified by distribution or other costs.
Such a situation is not surprising in the lucrative and imperfect pharmaceutical market, and calls for
effective government policy and regulation. Among the current problems: (i) a lengthy registration
process which requires cumbersome testing even for generic equivalents of registered drugs; (ii) a
prohibition on generic substitution by pharmacists; and (iii) pricing policies which   encourage
exaggeration of production and import costs and favor the marketing of higher-priced specialty drugs.
The public sector's purchasing and reimbursement practices are equally flawed. The public sector does
not limit its own purchasing or reimbursing to a list of essential drugs for primary and hospital care (the
existing "positive list" includes most drugs registered in the country). The public sector would also
benefit from bulk procurement of drugs and from a competitive bidding process, both of which would
lower unit costs. Finally, the NHIF places no ceiling on the amount of reimbursement for a particular
product (minus the copayment). Thus, the current policy framework provides no incentive to market
lower-cost drugs at competitive prices, and the existing financing mechanism permits this inefficiency to
flourish.
1.17           Inadeguate health promotion. Rising death rates from lifestyle-related chronic diseases
and persistent high rates of post-neonatal infant mortality speak to the need for more effective health
promotion. However, the modern concept of multi-sectoral and multi-media health promotion is largely
undeveloped. FYR Macedonia has some history of health education through a network of Public Health
Institutes whose dominant function is currently the collection of health statistics. Past health education
efforts were viewed with suspicion by the population, which saw them as a coercive, propagandistic arm
of the socialist state. Most health education efforts have not benefited from modern techniques of market
research and social marketing in order to select appropriate messages and media.  Finally, health
education and other disease prevention activities have functioned with minimal resources, with spending
amounting to less than two percent of total health expenditures in recent years.
1.18           Since the start of the transition, laudable efforts have been made to reorganize health
promotion activities according to health priorities, identify alternative funding and collaborate with
nongovernmental organizations (e.g., Red Cross) working at the community level. In 1993, government
activities were reorganized into eight national disease prevention programs, with funding for non-salary
expenditures from the central budget, in order to relieve pressure on the NHIF. However, budgetary
funding has fallen short of expectations, and NHIF resources have too often been channeled to short-term
curative needs by a medical community whose training is overwhelmingly oriented toward curative care.
Even the most basic disease prevention programs, such as maternal and child health care, are faltering,
and a medium term process of institutional development and resource reallocation is needed before health
promotion can fully play its role in reducing the burden of disease.

C. Government's Reform Strategy for Health
1.19           Reform of the health system since independence has included: (i) establishing a centralized
NHIF; (ii) introducing copayments, user fees and penalties for non-contribution; (iii) trimming the
guaranteed benefits package; (iv) increasing patient choice (although without retaining an appropriate
referral system); and (v) authorizing private health and insurance services, as well as NHIF
reimbursement of private services. The MOH and NHIF also enforced a radical--albeit insufficient--
downward adjustment in expenditures in response to fiscal crisis. Government quickly recognized,
however, the need for more fundamental reform and restructuring of the health system, in order to
reallocate resources toward cost-effective care and ensure fiscal sustainability of public spending. The
MOH took the decision to engage in a process of strategic planning--not only to define the health sector
reform program, but to identify the sequence of reforms most likely to ensure success. In mid-1994,
as part of the preparation process for the Health Sector Transition Project five technical working groups
were established consisting of MOH/NHIF personnel and representatives from other ministries, academia
and the medical community3'. Working together with World Bank and World Health Organization
support, these groups began to elaborate a strategy for medium-term health sector reform, including
appropriate sequencing of reform  measures.  They then identified the core policy agenda to be
implemented during the first phase of reform (1996-99), with support from an IDA project.
1.20           The overriding objective of Government's strategy for health system  reform  is to
overcome the current stagnation in health status by addressing high-priority health problems contributing
to infant, maternal and premature adult mortality. To achieve this, reforms will be aimed at: (i)
providing universal access to high-quality, basic preventive and curative health services and essential
drugs; (ii) promoting diversity and patient choice in the provision of services; (iii) establishing more
appropriate roles for the public and private sectors; (iv) ensuring the fiscal sustainability of public
spending for health; and, most importantly; (v) increasing the efficiency of resource allocation and use.
In the next three years, the core policy agenda will be implemented in the following areas: (i) Health
Finance and Management; (ii) Basic Health Services; and (iii) Pharmaceutical Policy and Supply.4'
Health Finance and Management
1.21           The objective for health financing reform in the next three years is to ensure universal
access to basic health services while introducing appropriate financial incentives, ensuring fiscal
sustainability and increasing the efficiency of resource use. Central to this goal will be the introduction
of a process to identify health priorities and cost-effective interventions, leading to the redesign of the
basic benefits package in order to address key health needs within a sustainable resource envelope.
Technical studies have been launched during the project preparation phase to examine the national burden
of disease and the cost-effectiveness of treatment. In redesigning the basic benefits package, supplemental
packages and premia will also be identified for those desiring broader coverage. Establishing an analytic

process within MOH for allocating resources will permit periodic adjustment of benefits packages and
premia in line with changing health priorities and resource availabilities. In conjunction with reform of
benefits, copayment, user fee and penalty policies will be reformed with an eye to eliminating excessive
exemptions, simplifying administration and minimizing barriers to essential health services.
1.22          Health financing reform  will also focus on introducing appropriate incentives for
efficiency and quality care. The current budgeting system will be superseded by provider payment
mechanisms which: (i) transfer some financial risk to health care providers; (ii) reward providers for their
level of effort and efficiency; (iii) remunerate public and private sector providers equally for equal
services; (iv) allow patient choice of physicians; and (v) establish predictable financial outflows from the
NHIF. Efforts will focus initially on the design, testing and nationwide implementation of a capitation
payment mechanism for primary health care. At the same time, pilot cost accounting data will be
generated which will permit the introduction of a case-mix based payment mechanism for hospital care.
Key to the success of the hospital payment mechanism, as well as to improved facilities management, will
be the design, testing and phased implementation of an integrated medical and financial information
system for public sector facilities, with appropriate linkage to the NHIF. This will involve a process of
identifying data needs, designing data collection mechanisms, developing an appropriate automation plan
and building analytic skills among future users of the information system. In addition, management
capacity will be enhanced througli training of MOH, NHIF and health facilities personnel. Intensive
training of trainers will ensure a core group for dissemination of management techniques and appropriate
feedback to line managers.
Basic Health Services
1.23          The objective of planned reforms in this area is to establish cost-effective, preventive and
curative primary health care as the backbone of the health system. Recently, Government took an
important step in this direction by reestablishing a mandatory referral system, in which individuals are
required to select a primary physician to serve as the first point of contact for routine care, and the
necessary referral for specialist outpatient and hospital care. In the next three years, Government intends
to redeploy public sector plysicianis to ensure adequate staffing of rural PHC centers, and invest in basic
equipment and in-service traininig for PHC staff to provide a broader, family medicine approach.
Streamlined PHC teams will be organized  in urban areas, and disease prevention programs will be
strengthened and modernized.
1.24          The complex task of restructuring and consolidating the public sector facilities network
will begin. Measures will be taken to reduce the number of public sector physicians, and limit the future
supply of doctors, dentists and pharmacists. The essential prerequisites to consolidation of the facilities
network--an appropriate referral system, adequate cost accounting and financial mechanisms in which
funds follow patients--will be put in place, followed by development and implementation of a
consolidation plan (to extend into the next phase of reform). An appropriate regulatory framework and
payment mechanisms will be established to promote voluntary and efficient development of private sector
health services.
Phannaceutical Policv and Supply
1.25          The goal of pharmaceutical reform in the 1996-99 period is to increase the availability
and affordability of essential drugs by creating a more competitive pharmaceutical market, establishing



- 13 -
efficient public sector procedures and promoting rational prescribing practices. A draft Drug Bill has
been reviewed by IDA, and will be considered by Parliament in the near future in order to support the
reform agenda. It establishes a streamlined registration procedure for generic equivalents, authorizes
generic substitution by licensed pharmacists and eliminates restrictive pricing policies which favored high-
priced drugs. Supporting regulations are being developed, as well as essential drug lists which will serve
as the basis for public sector procurement and reimbursement. The public sector will also develop
competitive bidding procedures for bulk procurement of essential drugs for public sector facilities, in
order to lower unit costs. The NHIF will place a ceiling on reimbursement of essential drugs based on
a low-cost reference price, as is comnmonly done in many western countries.  A National Drug
Information Center will be established to serve as a clearinghouse for global information on
pharmaceuticals, as well as to promote rational prescribing practices among physicians and develop media
campaigns to educate the public about low cost alternatives to branded specialty drugs currently on the
market.

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A. Proiect Obiectives
2.1           The dual objectives of the Health Sector Transition Project (HSTP) are to: (i) improve
the health of the population by enhancing the quality of basic health services; and (ii) support an initial
phase of policy reforms to increase cost-effectiveness, fiscal sustainability and patient choice within the
health system. These broad objectives will be achieved through activities and reforms under three project
components. The specific objectives of these three components are as follows:
(a)    build capacity to analyze and apply information for policy-making and health system
management;
(b)    strengthen primary health care and support high-priority disease prevention and health
promotion programs; and
(c)    reduce the cost of essential drugs by creating a more competitive pharmaceutical market.
2.2           Project outcome indicators, as agreed with the Government, to measure the success in
achieving these objectives are defined in the Project Implementation Plan (Annex 2, para. 42).
B. Proiect Commonents
2.3           Each component of the HSTP (estimated total cost of US$19.4 million) is defined around
a core policy agenda. Project activities are designed to support implementation of this policy agenda,
while reversing recent declines in the quality of basic health care. Therefore, the description of each
component begins with a summary of the core policy agenda, which is outlined in detail in the
Government's Letter of Development Policy (LDP) for the health sector in Annex 1. Progress in
fulfilling the agenda set out in the LDP will be subject to joint annual review by the MOH and the IDA.
2.4           During negotiations, Government gave assurances that it will implement the policy
reform agenda detailed in the Letter of Development Policy, and will review jointly with IDA progress
in carrying out the agenda on an annual basis.
Component I: Health Finance and Manayement (estimated base cost US$3.8 million)
2.5           Core policy agenda. The MOH and the Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) have diversified
revenues and reduced public spending for health care in line with reductions in national income and fiscal
resources. This has been achieved through dramatic reductions in real wages, drugs, medical supplies,
maintenance and investment--but has not been sufficient to avoid the accumulation of arrears in the sector.
This ad hoc fiscal adjustment must now give way to a planned adjustment focusing on reallocation of
resources toward more cost-effective health care, appropriate limitations on public sector reimbursement
and introduction of financial incentives for efficient and effective care in both the public and private
sectors.



- 15 -
2.6           The MOH will carry out a comprehensive review of sources and uses of funds in the
health sector, including existing and potential revenue sources and expenditures for primary care,
ambulatory specialists, diagnostic and laboratory services and hospital care. This will provide a broad
basis for carrying out reform of health financing mechanisms. In this first phase of reform, the core
policy agenda supported under this component will be:
(a)    definition of a fiscally-sustainable benefits package (on the basis of burden of disease
priorities and cost-effectiveness of treatment) to be covered by mandatory national health
insurance, as well as supplemental premiums and packages;
(b)    revision of copayment/user fee policies and penalties for non-contribution to health
insurance;
(c)    adoption of a capitation payment mechanism for public and private sector primary health
care; and
(d)    adoption of an integrated medical and financial information system for the public sector
health network, as a prerequisite to defining a new payment mechanism for hospital care.
The nature and timing of these reforms is described in detail in the LDP (Annex 1, paras. 5-9).
2.7           Activities. The Project will provide technical support for preparation and implementation
of the health financing reforms summarized above, as a continuation of technical work begun during
project preparation. Technical support would include a resident Health Financing Advisor responsible
for coordinating short-term teams of local and foreign consultants to carry out policy studies related to
each reform. The Project will also provide support for public information/advocacy campaigns using
social marketing techniques, to enhance understanding and acceptance of health sector reforms among
policy-makers, interest groups and the general public.
2.8           The capability of NHIF personnel to analyze and implement policy options would be
strengthened through fellowships and in-country training workshops in health economics, principles of
insurance, health system planning and public advocacy techniques, as well as a study tour of comparative
health financing systems. Capacity building for the NHIF office would include technical and financial
support to develop trainers and training seminars for staff of district HIF offices. The Project will also
support a study tour, initial training seminars and development of a continuing education program in
facilities management for hospital administrators and medical directors.
2.9           To provide the tools for effective management, and allow for the future introduction of
a case-mix based hospital reimbursement system, the Project will support development and testing of an
integrated medical and financial management information system for public sector health facilities. The
Project will implement the first phase of a medium-term automation plan for this integrated information
system. The management information system will be tested in two pilot districts, each of which will
receive an automation package--tailored to the size of the population served and existing hardware--for
the participating Medical Centers (general hospital and polyclinic), two primary health care centers,
district Institutes of Public Health (responsible for national health statistics), and district HIF offices.
Information technology will also be provided to the NHIF and NIPH offices. The necessary electronic
linkage for data transfer and processing within the NHIF network will be established.



- 16 -
2.10           Prior to negotiations, Government selected two pilot districts according to agreed upon
criteria for testing of: (i) the medical and financial management information system; (ii) the health
statistics information system; and (iii) the capitation payment mechanism for primary care.
Component 11: Basic Health Services (estimated base cost US$7.0 million)
2.11           Core Policy Agenda. Government's decision in 1991 to centralize district insurance funds
into a unified health insurance fund has helped to maintain universal access to care, while allowing
maximum  risk-sharing and alleviation of regional inequities in the quality of basic care.  In 1992,
national disease prevention programs were reorganized, and funding for materials and supplies was shifted
from the NHIF to the central budget, as an attempt--with mixed success--to ensure adequate support for
high-priority prevention and health promotion activities. Greater success was achieved in securing
humanitarian assistance to supply vaccines and essential drugs for health services during the transition.
However, this source has dwindled as donors await reform aimed at reorienting public sector resources
toward primary care. Under the Project, this reform will focus on providing cost-effective primary care
as the backbone of the health system, through:
(a)    reinstatement of a hospital referral system through mandatory annual enrollment with a
primary care physician;
(b)    assignment of full-time physicians to selected rural primary health centers;
(c)    adoption of a simplified staffing structure for primary health care teams in urban areas,
and of a guaranteed package of primary health services which provides cost-effective care
(based on successful models from other countries);
(d)    net reduction of at least 200 public sector physicians through attrition (retirement,
voluntary privatization) over the three year period;
(e)    reduction of enrollments in medical faculties for physicians, dentists and pharmacists; and
(f)    provision of adequate central budget funding for selected disease prevention activities.
The nature and timing of these reforms are described in detail in the LDP (Annex 1, paras. 10-16).
2.12           Activities.  The MOH  working group on basic health services undertook a needs
assessment and established a standard equipment list for rural PHC centers. Under the Project, basic
equipment kits corresponding to these needs will be distributed to all rural PHC centers in the country
(the list of basic equipment proposed is found in the PIP). In the first year of the Project, kits will be
distributed to 150 centers with one or more full-time physicians. The following year, kits will be
distributed to 50 additional PHC centers to which a full-time physician will be assigned. A more limited
equipment kit, appropriate for 50 centers without full-time physicians, will also be distributed in the
second year of the Project. In addition to equipping rural PHC centers, the Project will provide technical
and financial support for workshops and study tours to help MOH and professional associations develop
their own permanent programs for: (i) continuing education of primary care personnel; (ii) broadening
the skills of primary care physicians; and (iii) identifying and enforcing quality assurance standards for
primary care. Short-term fellowships will also be provided to develop capacity within the MOH for



- 17 -
planning and implementation of primary care strategies.
2.13          The Project will provide material support for five national disease prevention and health
promotion programs for: (i) immunization, (ii) maternal and child health; (iii) tuberculosis prevention;
(iv) AIDS prevention; and (v) blood donation and supply. These programs were selected on the basis
of their potential impact in reducing the national burden of disease and on the cost-effectiveness of the
proposed interventions. With respect to the immunization program, the Project will contribute to
maintaining coverage rates at 95 percent or more. While UNICEF will provide parallel financing for
most vaccines needed to combat childhood diseases and control epidemics, the Project will supply
necessary hepatitis B vaccines. In the area of maternal and child health, the Project will provide material
support for reproductive health services, as well as drugs and equipment for prevention and treatment of
disease in neonates and infants. Support will also be given for restructuring and expanding the existing
cervical cancer screening program. For prevention of tuberculosis, the Project will improve screening
capacity through provision of spare parts for x-ray equipment, photographic film and replacement of two
decrepit mobile clinics with one new mobile van. Under the AIDS prevention program, test kits will be
provided for HIV screening. To increase blood supply, the Project will build on the early success of
public campaigns aiming to restore donation levels to 60,000 units per annum, by providing support for
promotional materials in several local languages. Finally, the Project will provide equipment and
materials to strengthen laboratory diagnostics for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.
2.14          Prior to negotiations, Government gained parliamentary approval for amendments to the
Health Protection Law reinstating the hospital referral system through annual enrollment with primary
care physicians.
Component III: Phannaceutical Policy and Supply (estimated base cost US$5.7 million)
2.15          Core Policy Agenda. The share of national income spent on drugs in FYR Macedonia is
among the highest in the world. Prescribing practices favor overconsumption, while procurement, pricing
and reimbursement policies favor high-priced specialty drugs and limit competition. Private sector activity
has grown rapidly within a largely unregulated environment. An estimated half of national consumption
is financed by the public sector through the NHIF (US$28 million in 1994). Past public spending patterns
for drugs have been difficult to maintain as NHIF revenues have declined by 40 percent in real terms
since 1991. Public spending was supplemented with humanitarian assistance in the 1992-94 period, but
this source has dwindled rapidly. The time has come for Government to work within its real resource
constraints, and focus on more efficient procurement, pricing, reimbursement and prescribing in order
to ensure an affordable supply of essential drugs. With technical support from the World Health
Organization, the MOH has begun revision of drug legislation, as well as organizing seminars on rational
drug use and national drug policy.  The Project will build on these past efforts, emphasizing
implementation of key reforms in the following areas:
(a)    streamlining of registration procedures for equivalent products and authorization of
generic substitution;
(b)    adoption of pricing policies which favor lower-cost drugs;
(c)    adoption of appropriate essential drug lists for primary care and hospital care;



- 18 -
(d)    introduction of competitive bidding for public sector drug procurement;
(e)    establishment of a reference price reimbursement system for essential drugs; and
(f)    promotion of rational prescribing practices.
The nature and timing of these reforms are described in detail in the LDP (Annex II, paras. 17-24).
2.16           Activities. The Project will provide technical support for further revision of the Drug
Bill and accompanying regulations with respect to registration, pricing and generic substitution, as well
as establishment of essential drug lists for primary and hospital care. It will build local capacity for
competitive procurement and for implementation of a reference price reimbursement system for NHIF
which would place ceilings on allowable payments according to drug type. Capacity-building would
occur through external internships in international procurement offices, coupled with follow-up technical
support and studies to establish reference prices and carry out initial international tenders for drugs.
Essential drugs and supplies from the agreed lists would be procured in the second year of the Project,
to ease NHIF resource constraints and provide practical experience in international competitive bidding
for pharmaceutical products.
2.17          Under the Project, equipment, short-term fellowships, in-country training and technical
support will be provided to upgrade the present drug quality assurance system. Supply of advanced drug
testing equipment for quality control labs will enable government to match the increasing technical
sophistication of the domestic industry and foreign suppliers. It will facilitate bioequivalence testing to
permit rapid introduction of generic equivalents. The Project will also support the establishment of a
drug information center, as well as a srnall center for adverse drug reaction monitoring. Parallel funding
from EU/PHARE and WHO will contribute to improvements in the drug inspection system, as well as
provide institutional support and training for the drug information and adverse drug reaction centers.
Through the drug information center, the Project will support information campaigns directed at
prescribers, dispensers and the public to promote more rational use of drugs.
2.18           Prior to negotiations, Government submitted to IDA a satisfactory draft Drug Bill,
reflecting the Government's drug policy reform strategy.
2.19           As a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit Government will sign a contract
with a procurement agency to ensure procurement and distribution of pharmaceutical products, medical
equipment and supplies under the Project in accordance with IDA's Guidelines for Procurement
(January 1995). As a condition of disbursement of the pharmaceutical component a Drug Law,
satisfactory to IDA, regulating the registration, trade and distribution of drugs in the territory of the
Borrower, will be enacted, and all provisions for implementation of this legislation completed.
International Proiect Unit (estimated base cost US$0.9 million)
2.20           The Project will support establishment of an IPU in the Ministry of Health. The IPU will
be responsible for coordination, management and monitoring of the Health Sector Transition Project, as
well as coordination of other donor-funded activities in the health sector. The IPU will be headed by a
Director, with support from a core staff funded under the Project. This core staff will consist of a
Procurement Officer, Disbursernent Officer/Accountant, and Office Administrator/Interpreter employed



- 19 -
full-time for the Health Sector Transition Project.
2.21          IPU responsibilities will include: (i) project administration and coordination (including
liaison with the World Bank and agencies/institutions involved in implementation of the Project);
(ii) follow-up and reporting; and (iii) maintaining project records and accounts. It is also expected that
the IPU will provide a focal point for coordination of health sector reform activities, and assist in
dissemination of information about the reform program to policy-makers, interest groups and the general
public. To facilitate the work of the IPU, the Project will make available funding for short-term foreign
and local consultancy services, in project-related areas such as procurement and project management, as
well as policy-related areas such as health economics and private sector development  With additional
staff, the IPU could also serve to coordinate implementation of other donor-funded activities (e.g.,
EU/PHARE, UNICEF) to ensure that all externally-funded activities support the MOH's medium-term
strategy for health sector reform.
2.22           Prior to negotiations, Government established the International Project Unit within MOH
and appointed a full-time director and procurement officer with authorization to carry out the project
activities.
2.23           During negotiations, Government gave assurances that the MOH  will maintain
continuous staffing of the IPU to include a Director and staff devoted full-time to the Health Sector
Transition Project consisting of a procurement officer, disbursement officer/accountant and office
administrator/interpreter. It was further agreed that decisions would be taken jointly during project
implementation for recruitment of additional IPU staff, if necessary to entsure effective implementation
of the proposed Project.
C. Project Justification
Proiect Alternatives
2.24           As noted above, the dual objectives of World Bank intervention in the health sector in
FYR Macedonia are to: (i) improve the health of the population by enhancing the quality of basic health
services; and (ii) promote reforms to increase cost-effectiveness, fiscal sustainability and patient choice
in the health system. To achieve these objectives, alternative project designs were considered, and
ultimately rejected for the following reasons-'.
2.25           Improving health status. The known determinants of health status are--in descending
order of importance--(i) economic status; (ii) lifestyles/behaviors; (iii) quality of the health system; and
(iv) environmental risks. Socioeconomic conditions in FYR Macedonia have declined dramatically in the
past five years, exerting a negative impact on health status. Despite strong efforts by Government and
the World Bank to encourage stabilization, structural adjustment and capital investment, economic
recovery is expected to be slow--even if ideal policy and investment decisions are taken. Therefore,
improvement in health status must be through countervailing action on other determinants: lifestyles, the
51 See Annex 3, Selection among Alternative Project Designs for a more detailed discussion of options considered.



- 20 -
health system and the environment. World Bank efforts are already underway to identify and alleviate
environmental risks, leaving to this Project the task of reducing the burden of disease through behavioral
change and improved health services. Rapid assessment of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality
in FYR Macedonia indicates that no one vertical program would be more cost-effective than broad-based
primary care in reducing the overall burden of disease--hence support for comprehensive preventive and
curative primary care. Thought was given to investing solely in health promotion programs (which are
cost-effective in changing lifestyles in the long run) but ultimately the Project seeks a broader reallocation
of public resources toward health promotion--not just an IDA investment--which necessitates restructuring
and investment in the health network as a whole. Furthermore, it was not a politically acceptable option.
2.26           Promoting reforms to enhance cost effectiveness, fiscal sustainability and patient choice.
The Government has adopted one alternative to increasing the fiscal sustainability of the health system:
across-the-board budget cuts which have undermined the cost-effectiveness, quality and availability of
care. Another alternative--increasing the payroll tax burden--would have a negative impact on the cost
of labor, and is to be avoided. FYR Macedonia spends a relatively high share of national income (around
7 percent) on health, pointing to a need for more effective expenditures, not higher revenues. At this
point, the only alternative to achieving the goals of fiscal sustainability, cost-effectiveness and patient
choice simultaneously is to reallocate public resources toward more cost-effective health interventions,
set limits to public sector financial liabilities and create incentives for efficient and competitive behavior
among health care providers. The Project has been designed to maximize the likelihood of success in
carrying out these difficult reforms. Each component was designed around a core policy agenda, with
investments to support implementation of reforms according to a carefully designed sequence.
Financial Impact
2.27           Public sector. The project investments generate minimal incremental recurrent costs,
equal to less than one percent of recurrent health expenditures. Incremental costs associated with the
Project are dwarfed by the fiscal savings resulting from reforms supported by the Project. Among the
reform measures which will generate fiscal savings are:
(a)    definition of a basic benefits package for health insurance within the limits of expected
payroll contributions (workers, pensioners, registered unemployed);
(b)    shifting of care to less expensive levels, through an appropriate referral system;
(c)    reduction of public sector health personnel, and reduction of public sector support for
medical training;
(d)    introduction of financial incentives to prevent unnecessary medical procedures and
excessive lengths of stay;                      I
(e)    establishment of  lists of essential drugs for procurement and reimbursement, and
adoption of competitive bidding procedures and reference price reimbursement ceilings;
(f)    elimination of broad exemptions on copayments and user fees; and



- 21 -
(g)    consolidation of the public sector facilities network (to continue into the next phase of
reform).
The extent of fiscal savings will depend on future decisions about the scope of the benefits package, the
essential drug lists and the reduction in staffing and capacity. Initially, the objective will be to reduce
public spending for health in line with expected revenues, preventing further accumulation of arrears and
eliminating the existing stock of arrears. Whether there is a further reduction in public resources for
health--rather than an expansion of cost-effective interventions--is a political decision. One cannot argue
on economic grounds that FYR Macedonia is spending "too much" on health, but rather that the country
is not getting enough for its money. The Project will substantially increase the cost-effectiveness of
public spending for health, providing the opportunity to reduce the overall resource envelope to a
sustainable level.
2.28           Private sector. The reform agenda for pharmaceuticals will lower the cost of drugs (the
greatest source of private health expenditures) for everyone by creating a more competitive market and
revising pricing policies. Strengthening of primary care in rural areas will lower the out-of-pocket costs
of care for rural populations by reducing travel and waiting costs, as well as eliminating hospital
copayments and fees for routine care. Elimination of broad exemptions on copayments will raise out-of-
pocket costs for patients in specific groups, but care will be taken to reinforce the progressive nature of
copayments (higher rates for less essential services) and to define a means-tested basis for guaranteeing
access to basic services for the poor.
Rationale for Public Sector Involvement
2.29           Imperfections and failures in the health care and pharmaceutical markets (externalities,
uncertainty, asymmetry of information, market power), as well as societal equity considerations, justify
a strong--albeit changed--role for the public sector in the financing, regulation and, in some cases,
provision of health services.  Public sector financing of health services allows broad risk-pooling
(especially in a country as small as FYR Macedonia) to overcome the inefficiency of financial uncertainty.
It also allows redistribution to achieve equity objectives. Public sector health financing also serves as a
regulatory tool, through payment mechanisms which curb supplier-induced demand for unnecessary
services and other inefficient behavior by public and private sector providers. For these reasons, the
Project supports reform of the existing public sector financing mechanism in FYR Macedonia.
2.30           Many personal health services can be provided efficiently by the private sector once an
appropriate incentive structure and regulatory framework are in place. Reforms supported by the Project
aim to eliminate obstacles and create an environment conducive to privatization and private sector
development of health services. However, international experience demonstrates that the private market
will not offer sufficient incentive to provide socially desirable services in poorer, more isolated areas.
For this reason, most governments offer special incentives and/or direct public sector provision of basic
health services in poor, rural areas. Likewise, this Project will strengthen public sector provision of
primary health care only in targeted rural villages, where public sector intervention is justified.
2.31           The pharmaceutical market is notoriously noncompetitive, particularly in small markets,
where monopoly or oligopoly is common. The public sector generally relies on both regulation (e.g.
registration procedures, pricing and substitution policies) and direct provision of essential drugs to create
competition for the private sector. Unfortunately, the public sector itself is often very inefficient in



- 22 -
providing drugs, so that government failure may equal or exceed market failure. Thus, the Project
supports not only reforms aimed at creating a more competitive private market, but also measures to
increase the efficiency of Government procurement and distribution.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
2.32           Public sector investment in the health sector is justified on grounds that much of the
economic benefit of improved health status accrues to society at large, rather than providing a financial
return to the investor. In the absence of low-cost, domestic capital for public sector investment in human
development, IDA resources are a good choice for FYR Macedonia. The country has also turned to the
World Bank for assistance in this area because the Bank can provide high-quality technical advice on
health sector reform from a broad, international perspective. IDA involvement in health sector reform
in FYR Macedonia through this Project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
discussed by the Board of Directors during presentation of the Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment
Credit (FESAC; Credit 2721, Report No. P-6539) on April 19, 1995. Key objectives of the CAS include
maintenance of a fiscally sustainable social safety net during the transition period and restoration of long-
run economic growth. Broad access to basic health services is an essential element of the social safety
net, while improvement in health status will increase the productivity of human capital in the long run.
Health financing reforms also contribute to controlling fiscal deficits which undermine economic growth.
Hence, a health sector project has been included in the lending program, even under a low-case scenario.
2.33           Sector work was carried out at an early stage to identify priorities for health sector reform
and investment.t' Consultant reports produced in collaboration with the technical working groups during
project preparation addressed the following topics: (i) health finance; (ii) hospital care; (iii) primary health
care; and iv) health promotion." FYR Macedonia also participated in the Social Challenges of Transition
Exercise, which has provided a comparative view of health systems in nine other CEE countries, greatly
facilitating strategy formulation. The resulting health sector reform strategy is now serving not only as
the foundation for the Health Sector Transition Project, but also as an input in the definition of the
country's Policy Framework Paper and the proposed Social Sector Adjustment Loan (FY97).
Cost-Effectiveness of the Project
2.34           Project components were carefully selected not only for the cost-effectiveness of the
proposed investments, but also for the impact of associated reforms on the cost-effectiveness of public
resource use in the health sector as a whole. Rigorous cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analysis of each
component was not carried out during project preparation for two reasons: (i) a broader collaborative
process of assessing health priorities and evaluating cost-effectiveness of alternative interventions is an
integral part of the Project itself; and (ii) rigorous analysis was deemed unnecessary to provide an
adequate economic justification for the proposed investments. Justification of each component is as
follows:
2.35           Component 1: Health Finance and Management. This component provides economic and

fiscal benefits through its impact on the allocation of public resources in the health sector. During project
preparation, a process was initiated to assess health priorities by carrying out a national burden of disease
analysis, to be followed by use of cost-effectiveness analysis as a tool to define a more appropriate
benefits package for national health insurance. This, more than any other reform, will channel public
resources toward more cost-effective health interventions.  The process will continue under this
component, with the objective of not simply revising the initial benefits package, but of building
permanent capacity in the MOH to assess health priorities and use cost-effectiveness analysis to make
choices among alternative treatments. The component also supports the introduction of financial incentives
for efficient behavior by health care providers, and strengthens the management skills and information
tools needed to ensure cost-effective use of resources.
2.36          Component 11: Basic Health Services. The component invests in primary health care as
the backbone of the health system, strengthening, in particular, disease prevention and health promotion
activities. The project preparation team assessed the leading causes of morbidity and premature mortality
in FYR Macedonia--providing a rough indication of the burden of disease. With continued high levels
of infant mortality due to infectious diseases and maternal mortality due to high-risk pregnancies and
abortions, as well as rapidly rising premature mortality due to chronic diseases associated with unhealthy
lifestyles, it was clear that reduction in the burden of disease could be achieved most cost-effectively
through preventive and curative care at the primary level. The body of international evidence on the cost-
effectiveness of primary health care in addressing multiple elements of the burden of disease made the
calculation of potential disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) gained in FYR Macedonia unnecessary.
Cost-effectiveness of prevention efforts such as childhood immunization, family planning and prenatal
care--all supported under this component--are well established internationally, and no factors are present
which would significantly alter in FYR Macedonia the high ratio of benefits to costs.
2.37          Support for combatting infectious diseases which lead to disability and death in young
adults--AIDS and tuberculosis--also has a high DALY payoff, particularly given FYR Macedonia's
elevated incidence of tuberculosis (among the highest in the CEE). A proposal to intervene in the area
of smoking prevention would have been highly cost-effective, but was rejected by MOH as too
controversial at this time. The project preparation team (both IDA and client members) believes that
investment in less controversial disease prevention programs under this first Project, and demonstration
of success in applying modern social marketing techniques, will build a solid relationship upon which to
broach the more controversial smoking/tobacco issue under future projects.
2.38          Component III: Pharmaceutical Policy and Supplv. The benefit of this component lies
in its economy-wide impact on the price of essential drugs, as well as in the provision of essential drugs,
vaccines and medical consumables for effective primary care. The second most important determinant
of quality in primary health care--behind well-trained staff--is the availability of essential drugs. In recent
years, the Government has relied on humanitarian aid to supplement its own dwindling resources for
drugs, but these flows have largely dried up as a result of both regional events and resistance by donors
to continuing the supply in the absence of more meaningful reform of the pharmaceutical sector. The
Project will provide funding for essential drugs and vaccines--as an input into strengthening primary
health care--but will link investments to the implementation of a difficult reform agenda.
2.39          At an estimated three percent of national income, the rate of spending on pharmaceuticals
in FYR Macedonia is among the highest in the world. More than half of the estimated US$60 million
per annum in drug spending is funded by the public sector. Market prices of five to twenty times world



- 24 -
market levels indicate a noncompetitive market unrestrained by appropriate public sector regulation or
intervention. The reform agenda aims at improving the affordability and availability of essential drugs
by creating a more competitive policy environment and increasing the efficiency of public sector drug
procurement and reimbursement. If one makes a conservative estimate that implementation of the reform
agenda will lower prices by one-third, then the economy would save US$60 million during the three-year
project implementation period alone. Fiscal savings would total around US$30 million, against an initial
investment cost of US$6.4 million. These large economic and fiscal benefits would continue beyond the
life of the Project. This high benefit-cost ratio amply justifies the component--although success in
implementing the reforms may be politically difficult (see Risks, below).
Impact on Poverty
2.40          By reallocating public resources towards provision of high-quality basic health services,
the Project will benefit the poor, who cannot currently afford to pay out-of-pocket for private sector
services. By creating insurance payment mechanisms which reimburse public and private sector providers
equally for equal services, the Project gives patients--particularly poor patients--choice, and with choice,
the power to influence the quality of care provided. Investments in strengthening primary health care in
rural areas and in disease prevention (equal to 44 percent of the IDA credit) will also benefit the poor,
who live disproportionately in rural areas. Thus, the proportion of beneficiaries is significantly larger
than their proportion in the overall population, qualifying the Project for inclusion in IDA's Program of
Targeted Interventions. Replacing broad copayment exemptions for specific patient groups with a means-
tested basis for exempting the poor should also result in a better-targeted system of ensuring access to
basic health services.
IDnact on the Environment
2.41          The Project is expected to have a marginally beneficial impact on the environment. By
providing appropriate equipment for medical waste disposal at the primary care level, the Project will
have a small positive environmental impact. Otherwise, the Project will not have a direct impact on the
environment, and has been assigned to Environmental Category C.
Proeect Risks
2.42          Sustainabilitv of Political Commitment. The risk which dominates all others vis-a-vis the
success of the Project is political. It is the risk that the country cannot muster the political will necessary
to implement fundamental health sector reform, particularly with respect to limiting insurance benefits,
squeezing economic rents out of the pharmaceutical market and consolidating the public sector facilities
network. Government has only the health care consumer on its side, facing politically and economically
powerful medical and pharmaceutical interest groups. One of every seven parliamentarians is a doctor
which heightens the need for careful marketing of the reform strategy to lawmakers. Much will depend
on the leadership of the Minister of Health, and his ability to articulate to the public and the parliament
the objectives and strategies underlying the reform program.
2.43          To overcome this risk, the following strategy has been pursued. First, technical working
groups with representatives of relevant ministries, academia and the medical community were formed at
an early stage. This ensured broader participation of stakeholders in both strategy formulation and project
preparation. Second, the project preparation team encouraged early interaction with the media, resulting



- 25 -
in MOH press conferences at every stage of project design. Third, early efforts were also made to
market the emerging reform strategy to key political and economic policymakers. Success of reform will
depend on support from the highest levels of government, not only the commitment of the MOH.
Finally, and most importantly, resources have been included in the Project to support a vigorous
communications strategy, with a full-time consultant to the International Project Unit to assist the MOH
in designing and implementing effective public information campaigns. The Project will support continual
opinion research, as well as development of appropriate messages and media approaches for various
stakeholders, including the general public, the medical community and lawmakers.
2.44          Institutional Capacity. An additional project risk lies in the weak institutional capacity
of the MOH, and its limited experience in implementation of large, internationally funded projects. The
MOH has a direct staff of only 25, mostly with medical--as opposed to managerial--training. The MOH
is adjusting to its new role in a market-oriented health system, focused more on policymaking and
regulation than on direct provision of services. There is a tendency to want to exert heavy-handed,
centralized control rather than to rely on establishment of an appropriate policy environment, regulatory
framework and incentive structure. This is neither desirable in a mixed public/private health system, nor
feasible given manpower and financial constraints. Thus, institutional constraints to effective
implementation are both physical and psychological.
2.45          Experience in implementing internationally-funded projects has been limited to the
distribution of humanitarian aid in recent years. To alleviate this and other weaknesses in institutional
capacity, the Project invests heavily in building managerial capacity within the MOH and NHIF through
training, study tours and technical assistance. The Project also supplements MOH implementation
capacity through provision of long-term local management consultants to support the newly-created
International Project Unit. The IPU will coordinate implementation of this Project, as well as other
donor-funded investments. Although the reform agenda is substantive, the Project itself was designed
for easy implementation: simple investments organized into a small number of procurement packages.
Medical equipment, supplies, drugs and vaccines accounting for more than 60 percent of the IDA credit
will be procured by a local agent with sophisticated infrastructure and a strong track record on
international purchasing and nationwide distribution.
Monitorin2 and Evaluation
2.46          A detailed description of project monitoring and evaluation--including summary tables for
inputs, outputs and outcomes--is provided in Chapter IV of the PIP (Annex 2). Project monitoring will
involve assessment of project inputs and outputs. Monitoring the use of project resources will be done
by tracking inputs according to component, activity and expenditure category (PIP, Table 9). Monitoring
outputs under the Project is more complex, involving both implementation of project activities and
implementation of the policy reform agenda. For the former, key project activities have been identified
as output indicators (PIP, Table 10). For the latter, progress in implementing reforms will be jointly
assessed by Government and IDA on an annual basis. A timetable of expected progress, with carefully-
defined progress benchmarks, has been summarized in the policy matrix attached to the Government's
Letter of Development Policy (Annex 1). For project evaluation, a limited set of outcome indicators has
been selected on the basis of relevance to the project objectives, sensitivity to project activities, ease of
data collection and parsimony (PIP, Table 11). However, it is recognized that changes in some of these
indicators cannot be causally linked directly to project activities, since the Project is only one of multiple
factors impacting health status and services during the short (three-year) implementation period.



- 26 -
However, annual monitoring of these indicators will provide evidence of overall trends in the health status
of the population, the effectiveness of health services and the efficiency of public spending for health--all
of which the Project seeks to influence positively.
Overall Coherence and Completeness of the Policy Framework
2.47          The Health Sector Transition Project has been designed around a core policy agenda for
health sector reform. This core policy agenda, as summarized in the Letter of Development Policy, is
a coherent and sound basis for IDA involvement in the health sector. While it does not solve all
problems in the health sector, this initial phase of reform carefully identifies those measures which will
have the greatest impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of public spending for health. A careful
sequencing of reforms within the three-year project implementation period was elaborated by
Government. Implementation of these reforms--with support from the Project--will lead to the reallocation
of public resources toward more cost-effective health interventions, introduce incentives for efficiency
and quality, build managerial capacity, strengthen basic health services in poorer, rural areas, introduce
modern techniques of health promotion and vastly increase the affordability and availability of essential
drugs. These outcomes are central to the short- and long-run improvement of health status in FYR
Macedonia, the objective against which IDA involvement will be evaluated.

111. PROJECT COSTS. FINANCING, MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
3.1           This chapter provides a summary of the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) prepared in
collaboration with the Borrower, and reviewed and found satisfactory by IDA. The PIP, attached to this
Staff Appraisal Report as Annex 2, includes detailed information on:  (i) project implementation
arrangements and responsibilities; (ii) project cost, financing, procurement and disbursement
arrangements; (iii) monitoring and evaluation; (iv) supervision and reporting requirements; (v) initial
project implementation schedules; and (vi) several agreed terms of reference and equipment lists.
A. Project Cost
3.2           Total project cost is estimated at US$19.4 million, or MKD 737 million equivalent,
including contingencies.  Total  base cost is estimated at US$17.4 million.  Physical and price
contingencies are estimated at US$1.4 million and US$0.6 million, respectively. The foreign exchange
component is estimated at US$14.5 million, or 75 percent of total cost. All imported goods and services
destined for health institutions and related purposes--including those financed under the Project--are
exempt from taxation and customs duties.
3.3           Project costs include financing for medical and laboratory equipment and supplies,
essential drugs and vaccines, office equipment, computers, furniture, local and external technical
assistance and training, minor facilities' rehabilitation, and incremental operating costs (including
equipment maintenance, supplies and incremental staff salaries). Cost estimates by project component
are shown in Table 1 of the PIP, and by expenditure category in Table 2.
B. Project Financing
3.4           The proposed IDA Credit of SDR 11.8 million (US$16.9 million equivalent) will finance
87 percent of the estimated total project cost, including 100 percent of the total foreign exchange cost
(US$14.5 million) and 48 percent of estimated local costs (about US$2.4 million of a total US$5.0
million). The Government will finance the remaining estimated US$2.5 million in local costs. Table 3
of the PIP shows the financing plan for the Project, and Table 4 the project cost breakdown by
component and financier.
3.5           Project cost estimates include US$0.3 million (1.5 percent of total project cost) in
incremental operating costs attributable to the Project during the three-year period. These costs comprise
equipment operation and maintenance, minor operating expenses and supplies, and incremental staff
salaries. On an annual basis, these incremental operating costs are estimated at MKD 5.0 million, equal
to less than 1 percent of the recurrent health budget. These costs will be more than compensated by fiscal
savings from a number of measures being undertaken by the MOH, inter alia, limiting insurance benefits,
introducing competitive procurement for pharmaceuticals and reducing public funding for medical
training.
3.6           Project start-up is being facilitated through a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) Advance
of US$223,500 (P983-0-MK). The PPF is being used to establish and equip the International Project Unit



- 28 -
(IPU), hire and train key project unit staff, and hire local experts needed for a series of technical studies
to be carried out with assistance from a team of external consultants.
C. Project Mana2ement and Implementation
3.7           The IPU, established in the MOH, is headed by a Director, and supported by several full-
time staff (long-term local consultants under contract with the MOH for the duration of the Project),
including: a procurement officer (already in place), disbursement officer/accountant, and office
administrator/interpreter .
3.8           The IPU is be responsible for coordination, management and monitoring of the Health
Sector Transition Project. More specifically, the Unit's responsibilities include: (i) project administration
and coordination (including liaison with IDA and agencies and institutions involved in implementation
of the Project); (ii) procurement coordination and follow-up; (iii) maintaining project records and
accounts; and (iv) monitoring, evaluation, and progress reporting. It is also expected that the IPU will
provide a focal point for coordination of health sector reform activities, and assist in dissemination of
information about the reform program to policymakers, interest groups and the general public. Short-
term local and external consultancy services in areas such as procurement and project management, as
well as in policy-related areas such as health economics and market regulation, are foreseen to assist the
IPU in fulfilling its role. With the addition of more full-time staff, the IPU will also serve as
coordinating agency for other donor-funded activities (e.g., WHO, UNICEF), ensuring consistency with
the MOH's medium-term strategy for sector reform.
3.9           Overall responsibility for implementation of each of the components is as follows:
(i) Health Finance and Management--lead agency, the National Health Insurance Fund; (ii) Basic Health
Services--lead agency, the Office of the Assistant Minister for Primary and Preventive Health Care; and
(iii) Pharmaceutical Policy and Supply--lead agency, the Department of Pharmaceuticals in the MOH.
A thorough discussion of implementation responsibilities is found in Sections B and C of the PIP.
D. Proiect Supervision
3.10          The Project is expected to require a total of about 33 weeks of supervision per year
during the three-year implementation period, including 15 weeks for routine supervision of project
implementation, and 18 weeks of supervision and continued dialogue and advice on implementation of
the core policy agenda. Estimated annual supervision requirements are presented in Table 8 of the PIP.
E. Procurement Arrangements
3.11          Items to be procured have been grouped into a small number of packages (about eight)
to encourage competitive bidding and permit bulk procurement. The Bank's standard bidding documents
will be used for procurement under the Project. Paragraphs 25-34 of the PIP found in Annex 2 provide
details regarding procurement arrangements envisaged under the Project, and the standard procurement
information is presented in Table 5. All procurement financed under the Credit will be carried out in



- 29 -
accordance with IDA Guidelines. Details concerning procurement packages, including the nature of the
package, estimated value and implementation timetable, are presented in Table 6 of the PIP.
F. Disbursements
3.12          The proposed Project is expected to be disbursed over a period of three years, which is
considerably shorter than the All-Regions Profile for health and population projects of 9.5 and 8.5 years,
respectively. In addition, the country profile is speculative since this Project is only the second operation
in the human resources sectors in the FYR Macedonia, the first having become effective less than one
year ago. The shorter implementation period for the Health Sector Transition Project reflects the nature
of the Project as a source of bridge financing during the initial phase of the transition and in support of
the first phase of the Government's health reform program. Investments under the Project, and the
packaging of procurement, have been kept simple to accommodate the shorter timeframe. Implementation
and related disbursements will be facilitated by having defined equipment lists and agreed terms of
reference prior to project implementation (see Chapters V & VI of the PIP). Moreover, the use of an
experienced procurement agency to procure and distribute, on behalf of the MOH, medical equipment,
supplies and pharmaceuticals procured under the Project (estimated value about US$7 million or 40% of
the IDA credit) will also simplify implementation. The closing date will be March 31, 2000. Estimated
disbursements of the Credit by year are shown in Table 7 of the PIP.
3.13          Implerr.entation will be facilitated by the establishment of a Special Account, opened by
the Government in a bank and maintained under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. The account
will be denominated in US dollars, and will have an authorized allocation of US$1.0 million. Further
details regarding the Special Account are outlined in para. 36 of the PIP.
G. Proiect Audits and Reportin2
3.14          The IPU will be responsible for coordinating annual project audits and for fulfilling
reporting requirements. With respect to project accounts, including the Special Account, they will be
audited in accordance with IDA's Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed
by the World Bank (March 1982), and will be provided by the Borrower within six months of the end
of each fiscal yea!. In addition, the IPU will be responsible for preparing semi-annual progress reports,
which will include:  a sunmmary of progress under each component, proposals for rescheduling of
activities where necessary, actual disbursements and projections for the subsequent six-month reporting
period, as well as a thorough analysis of progress in implementation of the health sector reform program
as outlined in the Letter of Development Policy. Further information concerning auditing and progress
reporting under the Project is provided in paras. 37-38 of the PIP.
3.15          During negotiations, Government gave assurances that it will prepare and furnish to
the Association by January 31, 1998 a report on progress achieved in carrying out the Project up to
that time and proposing measures to ensure achievement of objectives during the remaining project
period. It was further agreed that the Association and the Borrower will jointly review this report by
March 31, 1998 and, on the basis of conclusions from that review, agree on steps to be taken to ensure
efficient project completion.



- 30 -
H. Status of Preparation
3.16          During the initial stages of preparation, the Borrower established five technical working
groups to develop project proposals for each component. That structure--with minor modification--has
remained in place and has been a principal contributor to the thorough preparation process. Through
changes in political leadership at MOH, the working groups provided continuity in preparation of both
the reform strategy and the specific project proposals, leading to an internalization of the Project by MOH
personnel and participants from the medical community and associated institutions. The close
collaboration of the working groups with IDA staff and with WHO led to progress in the formulation of
the Government's medium-term strategy, which has served as the basis for the core policy agenda
supported under this Project. This agenda has been broadly discussed with a view to achieving the
consensus necessary for its implementation. The Project Implementation Plan, setting out detailed
responsibilities and arrangements for carrying out project activities, has been prepared and agreed.
Lastly, the IPU has been established and key staff appointed to ensure a smooth start-up of project
implementation.

IV. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Benefits
4.1           The economic benefits of the Project include better quality basic health services and more
cost-effective use of public resources for health--both of which will counteract the negative impact of
recent economic and fiscal contraction on the health of the population. Benefits by component are as
follows:
4.2           Component I: Health Finance and Management. This component provides economic and
fiscal benefits through its impact on the allocation of public resources for health.  It will result in a
reallocation of public resources toward more cost-effective health interventions, as well as limitation of
health expenditures to fiscally sustainable levels. The component implements a basic benefits package
for health insurance which is based on cost-effective treatment of national health priorities, and is tailored
to available resources. It also develops permanent capacity in the MOH to use the tools of burden of
disease and cost-effectiveness analysis to adjust benefits as health priorities and resource constraints
evolve. The component will also put in place incentives for efficiency and quality of care, through the
establishment of new provider payment mechanisms, and will build managerial skills and provide
management tools--particularly the integrated medical and financial information system--which will result
in more effective resource management in the health sector
4.3           Component II: Basic Health Services. Cost-effective reduction in the burden of disease,
through improved preventive and curative primary care, is the major economic benefit of this component.
With continued high levels of infant mortality due to infectious diseases and maternal mortality due to
high-risk pregnancies and abortions, as well as rapidly rising premature mortality rates due to chronic
diseases associated with unhealthy lifestyles, it is clear that preventive and curative primary care is the
most cost-effective way to reduce multiple elements of the burden of disease. The component will result
in adequately staffed and equipped primary health care centers in rural areas, offering a broader approach
to family medicine with greater emphasis on disease prevention and health promotion. It will also begin
the process of consolidating staffing and physical capacity in the public sector network in order to use
resources more efficiently. The component will result in more effective reduction of the leading causes
of infant, child, maternal and other premature adult mortality through support for prevention programs
in the areas of childhood immunization, maternal and child health, tuberculosis and AIDs prevention and
blood supply. Within these prevention programs, a demonstration of the effectiveness of modern, social
marketing techniques in changing lifestyles to improve health will pave the way for greater investment
in health promotion under future projects.
4.4           Component III: Pharmaceutical Policy and Supply. The benefits of this component lie
in its economy-wide impact on the price of essential drugs, as well as the direct provision of drugs,
vaccines and medical consumables for more effective primary care. The second most important
determinant of quality in primary care--behind well-trained staff--is the availability of essential drugs.
The component will supply drugs and other consumables, linked to implementation of pharmaceutical
sector reform aimed at increasing the affordability and availability of essential drugs. Legislative reform
will result in streamlined registration procedures allowing easier market entry for lower-cost generic
equivalents. It will also allow licensed pharmacists to substitute lower-cost generic equivalents for



- 32 -
prescription specialty drugs. Reform of pricing policies will alter financial incentives to encourage
marketing of lower-cost drugs. Adoption of essential drug lists for public sector procurement and
reimbursement, as well as the introduction of competitive bidding for bulk procurement and reference
price ceilings for public sector reimbursement will lower unit costs for drugs in the public sector, and
channel public resources toward the most cost-effective drugs. Overall, the economic and fiscal gains
of this component dwarf the economic costs, with fiscal savings in the three-year project implementation
period conservatively estimated at ten times the investment cost. These large economic and fiscal benefits
will continue beyond the life of the Project.
B. Risks
4.5            The Project faces two key risks--one political, the other institutional. The political risk
is dominant in determining the success of the Project. It is the risk that the country cannot muster the
political will necessary to implement fundamental health sector reform, particularly with respect to
limiting insurance benefits, squeezing economic rents out of the pharmaceutical market and consolidating
the public sector facilities network. Government has only the health care consumer on its side, facing
powerful medical and pharmaceutical interest groups. One of every seven parliamentarians is a doctor--
heightening the need for careful marketing of the reform strategy to lawmakers. To reduce this risk, the
following strategy has been pursued. First, technical working groups with representatives of relevant
ministries, academia and the medical comrnunity were formed at an early stage to ensure broad
participation in both strategy formulation and project preparation. Second, the project preparation team
encouraged early interaction with the media, resulting in MOH press conferences at every stage of project
design. Third, early efforts were also made to market the emerging reform strategy to key political and
economic policymakers. Finally, and most importantly, resources have been included in the Project to
support a vigorous communications strategy, including a full-time consultant to the International Project
Unit assisting the MOH in designing and implementing effective public information campaigns. The
Project will support continual opinion research, as well as development of appropriate messages and
media approaches for various stakeholders, including the general public, the medical community and
lawmakers.
4.6           A secondary risk lies in the weak institutional capacity of the MOH, and its limited
experience in implementation of internationally-funded projects. The MOH has a direct staff of only 25,
mostly with medical--as opposed to managerial--training. Some are having difficulty adjusting to the new
role of the MOH in a more market-oriented health sector. Indeed, institutional constraints to effective
project implementation are both physical and psychological. To alleviate this risk, the Project will invest
heavily in building managerial capacity within the MOH and NHIF through training, study tours and
technical assistance. The Project also supplements MOH's implementation capacity through provision
of local management consultants, working full-time to support the newly-created International Project
Unit. The IPU will coordinate implementation of this Project, as well as other donor-funded investments
to ensure coherence with the medium term strategy for health sector reform. Although the reform agenda
supported by the Project is substantive, project activities were designed for easy implementation: simple
investments organized into a small number of procurement packages. Medical equipment, supplies, drugs
and vaccines accounting for more than 40 percent of the IDA credit will be procured by a local agent
with sophisticated infrastructure and a strong track record of international purchasing and nationwide
distribution.

V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.1           Prior to negotiations, Government:
(a)    selected two pilot districts according to agreed upon criteria for testing of: (i) the
medical and financial management information system; (ii) the health statistics
information system; and (iii) the capitation payment mechanism for primary care (para.
2. 10);
(b)    gained Parliamentary approval for amendments to the Health Protection Law reinstating
the hospital referral system through annual enrollment with primary care physicians
(para. 2.14);
(c)    submitted to IDA a satisfactory draft Drug Bill, reflecting the Government's drug policy
reform strategy (para. 2.18); and
(d)    established an International Project Unit within MOH and appointed a full-time director
and procurement officer with authorization to carry out the project activities (para. 2.22).
5.2           During negotiations, Government gave assurances that it will:
(a)    implement the policy reform agenda detailed in the Letter of Development Policy, and
will review jointly with IDA progress in carrying out the agenda on an annual basis
(para. 2.4);
(b)    maintain continuous staffing of the IPU, to include a Director and staff devoted full-time
to the Health Sector Transition Project consisting of a procurement officer, disbursement
officer/accountant and office administrator/interpreter (2.23); and
(c)    prepare and furnish to the Association, by January 31, 1998, a report on progress
achieved in carrying out the Project up to that time and proposing measures to ensure
achievement of objectives during the remaining project period. It was further agreed that
the Association and the Borrower will jointly review this report by March 31, 1998 and,
on the basis of conclusions from that review, agree on steps to be taken to ensure
efficient project completion (para. 3.15).
5.3           As a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Credit, Government will:
(a)    sign a contract with a procurement agency to ensure procurement and distribution of
pharmaceutical products, medical equipment and supplies under the Project in accordance
with IDA's Guidelines for Procurement (January 1995) (para. 2.19).
5.4           As a condition of disbursement of the Pharmaceutical Policy and Supply component:
(a)    a Drug Law, satisfactory to IDA, regulating the registration, trade and distribution of
drugs in the territory of the Borrower, will be enacted, and all provisions for the
implementation of this legislation completed (para. 2.19).
Recommendation
5.4           Subject to the above, the proposed Project provides a suitable basis for an IDA Credit
of SDR 11.8 million (US$16.9 million equivalent) to the Government of FYR Macedonia.

Mr. James Wolfensohn
President

Washington, D.C. 20433
Dear Mr. Wolfensohn:
The Republic of Macedonia inherited from the former Yugoslav federation a publicly-funded and
publicly-provided health system, organized on the basis of "self-managed communities of interest"
with decentralized health insurance funds and local networks of health facilities. The system had a
number of strengths, including universal health coverage, broad access, minimal financial risk for
individuals, well-trained health personnel and strong epidemiological control. As a result, the
health system contributed to the long-term improvement in the health of the population, with life
expectancy rising from 61 years in 1960 to 72 years in 1990--far exceeding the average for
countries of similar income level, and even surpassing the average for much wealthier countries in
Central and Eastem Europe. Nonetheless, the health system at independence suffered from long-
standing weaknesses and inefficiencies. In particular, the system offered no financial incentives to
health personnel and patients to increase efficiencv, control costs and improve the quality of care.
Facilities lacked clear ownership as well as managenral autonomy and decision-making skills.
Excessive decentralization had led to duplication and fragmentation of services, coupled xvith
regional inequities in the quality of care. The system relied too heavily on hospital-based care, and
overemphasized curative treatment at the expense of more effective disease prevention programs.
These problems were underscored during the early years of independence, when severe economic

contraction led to a dramatic decline in public resources for health, which fell by nearly 40 percent
in real termns between 1991 and 1993. This decline gave greater urgency to the need for reforms to
increase the cost-effectiveness of health spending.
Health System Reform Since Independence
Following independence in 1991, we revised the existing Health Protection Law to address
certain structural problems in the health system. In particular, we established a single, centralized
Health Insurance Fund (HIF) to maximize risk-sharing and alleviate regional inequities in the
quality of care. Socially-owned facilities were transformned into a single network of public sector
facilities reporting to the Ministry of Health (MOH). Private sector health insurance and health
services were authorized, along with HIF reimbursement of private services (reimbursement of
private services has been limited, in practice). Patients were granted free choice of physicians,
although regulations were not put in place to maintain an appropriate hospital referral system.
This has since exacerbated the overreliance on hospital-based care. Further revision in 1993
introduced financial participation by patients in the costs of ambulatory care, hospital care, drugs,
medical supplies and prosthetic devices (copayments ranging from 10 to 50 percent of the reference
price).  A  first effort was also made to exclude some health services--largely cosmetic
interventions--from HIF reimbursement, and to require the uninsured to pay for health services out-
of-pocket.
We were obliged to make a rapid and difficult fiscal adjustment in the health system.
Public sector spending for health declined in line kith real reductions in national income, although
this was insufficient to prevent the accumulation of arrears. This ad hoc expenditure adjustment
was not optimal, relying on across-the-board reductions in recurrent spending (for drugs. vaccines,
medical supplies, maintenance, utilities and staff remuneration) rather than restructuring of the
public system and reallocation of resources toward more cost-effective types of care. As a result,
the quality and broad availability of basic health services has been seriously compromised in recent
years.  We are commuitted to more fundamental restructuring and resource reallocation, but
recognize the need for strategic planning and technical expertise to define an appropriately-
sequenced reform program. With financial and technical support from the proposed IDA-funded
Health Sector Transition Project, ve have already embarked on the process of defimng and
implementing a medium-term  strategy for health system  reform.  Technical working groups
established by our MOH to prepare the project have elaborated a number of background papers
setting out the broad objectives of our health system reform, and outlining a sequence of steps to
achieve them. Using these documents as a basis, the technical working groups have identified a
limited number of core policy measures to be implemented during the first phase of reform, with
support from the proposed IDA-funded health project.
Strate2'v for Health System Reform. 1996-99
Our overriding objective is to overcome the current stagnation in health status associated
w%ith the early phase of the transition, by addressing high-prioritv health problems contributing to
infant, maternal and premature adult mortality. To achieve this, we will focus on reform of the
health system aimed at: i) maintaining universal access to basic preventive and curative health
services and essential drugs; ii) promoting diversitv and patient choice in provision of health
services; iii) redefining the role of the public sector in health policy and service delivery. and
establishing a more appropriate public/private mix of health services; iv) improving the fiscal
sustainabilrx of public spending for health; and v) increasing the efficiency of resource allocation

and use.  An initial phase of reforms will be implemented over the next three years. This core
policy agenda will focus particularly on: i) health financing and reimbursement; ii) organization
and management of health service; and iv) pharmaceutical policies and supply.
Health Financin2 and Mana2ement
Our objectives for health financing over the next three years are to ensure universal access
to basic health services while introducing appropriate financial incentives and ensuring fiscal
sustainability of the Health Insurance Fund. On November 7, 1995, we submitted to Parliament a
further revision of the Health Protection Law which specifies that out-of-pocket payment is
required for all health services not explicitly covered by compulsory health insurance, and for
specialist outpatient and hospital care to which the patient was not referred by his/her primary
physician. This is part of our effort to reestablish a referral system in order to discourage
excessive use of hospitals (see para. 11)   for discussion of the referral system), as well as a
precursor to further limiting compulsory health insurance coverage. In the next three years, we
will focus our efforts on the followNing core policy agenda: i) definition of a basic package of health
services for compulsory health insurance coverage; ii) revision of copayment and user fee policies,
and penalties for non-contribution to insurance, iii) adoption of a capitation payment mechanism
for public and private sector primary health care; and iv) adoption of an integrated medical and
financial information svstem (as a prerequisite to defining a case-mix payment mechanism for
hospital care). PHRD grant resources made availabl by the Japanese Government for project
preparation will permit us to begin the necessary technical studies shortly. The recommendations
of these studies will be reviewed by our Government's Technical Committee on Health Finance,
which will then propose necessary legislative and regulatory changes.
Basic benefits for comDulsorv health insurance coverage. A technical team of foreign
and local experts will assess the burden of disease in Macedonia in order to quantitatively evaluate
health priorities.  They Nvill then use existing information on the cost-effectiveness of various
treatments along with estimated costs of actual treatment in our country to recommend ways to
limit basic health insurance coverage in terms of types of services and level and/or lifetime value of
reimbursements. Their objective N1ill be to define a basic package which is financially sustainable
Within the expected resources from statutory health insurance contributions. At the same time,
they w'ill define one or more supplemental premiums and packages for those who desire broader
coverage. We anticipate that the technical proposal for basic and supplemental packages will be
ready by December 31, 1996, with Government presentation of the recommended packages to
Parliament by June 30, 1997. Following Parliamentary discussion and adoption, we expect the
resulting basic package to be under implementation through the HIF by December 31, 1997.  Its
presentation to Parliament will- coincide v.ith presentation of proposed revisions to the Health
Protection Law. These revisions will increase the flexibilitv of the law to permit: i) periodic
adjustment of the basic package of health services, ii) revision of copayment and user fee policies;
and iii) introduction of new provider payment mechanisms.
Couavment and user fee policies. Existing proposals to revise copavment and user fee
policies will be studied in order to simplify admninistration, eliminate excessive exemptions and
grant Government flexibility to periodically adjust rates through an appropriate institutional
mechanism.  Recommendations will be review ed by the Technical Committee on Health Finance
and then incorporated in revisions to the Health Protection LaN, to be presented to Parliament for a
first reading by June 30,1997. The revised policy is expected to be implemented by December 31,
1997.

Capitation pavment mechanism for vrimary health care. In the next few years we wlill
proceed with the design, testing and nationwide implementation of a capitation payment system for
primary health care. Currently, salary and material payments to public sector facilities are made
regardless of service utilization, while payments to the emerging private sector are erratic and
prone to abuse. Adoption of a capitation system corresponds to our needs to find a payment
mechanism which: i) emphasizes primary care as the backbone of the health system; ii) rewards
health care providers for their level of effort and their efficiency; iii) remunerates public and
private sector providers equally for equal services, iv) allows patient choice of primary physician;
and v) establishes a predictable financial outflow  from the H1F.  Technical study Will begin
immediatel. to define the basic package of primarv health services to be included within the
capitated payment (as part of the larger process of defining basic insurance coverage) and
estimating the average per capita cost of providing these services. Design and implementation of
the capitation payment system will be linked to our reinstatement of a referral svstem   and
restructuring of public sector primary health care teams (para. I 1). Legislative revisions needed to
allow  introduction of the capitation system  will be included in the proposal  presented to
Parliament by June 30,1997. Pilot testing of the capitation system in two zones will also begin bv
June 30 1997 and extend for a full year. Two pilot sites were selected prior to negotiation of the
proposed health project. By June 30 1998, regulations regarding the capitation system will be
modified as necessary, with nationwide implementation completed by June 30, 1999.
Inteerated medical and financial information system for public sector health facilities.
We intend to design, test and implement for all public sector health facilities an integrated medical
and financial information system which assists managers in strategic decision-making and permits
development of a case-mix based payment system for hospital care. The proposed design of the
integrated management information system (MIS) will be presented to the Technical Committee on
Health Finance (Information Systems subcommittee) by June 30, 1997. One-year pilot activities
in two zones, including two medical centers (general hospital and polyclinic) and four associated
primary care centers, will be underway by June 30, 1997 in order to test and refine the MIS By'
June 30 1998, a technical review of the pilot phase will be completed, and a plan defined for
introduction and eventual automation of the MIS nationwide. Data from the pilot phase vAill be
used to develop a case-mix based pavment system  for hospitals. to steer resources toward
productive facilities and create incentives for efficiency and cost containment. This will replace the
current system of allocating resources largely on the basis of staffing. The technical proposal for a
new  hospital payment system  will be completed by December 31, 1998, with nationlide
implementation undervay by June 30, 1999.   In addition to the facilities-based NIS, data
collection for national health statistics (e.g. morbidity, mortality) will be strengthened under the
proposed Health Sector Transition Project.
Organization of Health Services
In an aggregate sense, staffing levels and service capacity in our health system are on par
with averages in Westem Europe. However, services are not organized for optimal efficiency, and
the system represents a heavy fiscal burden given our national income level. Duplication and
fragmentation of services are common, due to the highly decentralized approach of the past. Manv
facilities are fully staffed, but underutilized. Shortages in drugs and supplies at the periphery
coupled with a breakdown of the referral system have scnt patients streaming into tertiary care
hospitals to meet even their basic primary health care nceds. We recognize the need to rationalize
our public sector health system, shifting the bulk of care to wNhere treatment is most cost effective--
4



ANNEX 1
Page 5 of 15
the primary level--and consolidating or liquidating redundant services wvhen they are clearly
identified. However, rationalization will only be possible with: i) development of accounting and
payment mechanisms which explicitly link resources to service delivery; ii) reinstatement of an
appropriate referral system to shift patients to the primary level; and, most importantly, iii)
provision of high-quality care at the primary level.
Development of new accounting and payment mechanisms will be supported by the
proposed health project, and reform measures are described in paras. 9-10 above. Amendments to
the Health Protection Lawv reinstating a referral system were adopted by Parliament on November
7, 1995. Under the amendment, individuals select a primary physician (with the option to change
each year) who is the first point of contact for routine care, and provide the required referral for
specialist outpatient and inpatient services (except emergency care). Each individual's health
identity card will include the name of his/her primary physician.  This policy will halt the
indiscriminate use of specialist and hospital services, particularlv for primary health needs.
However, implementation of this policy will be successful only if high-quality services are
available at the primary level.
Both policy reform and investmnents are needed to improve the quality and ensure the
financial sustainabilitv of our primary health care system, particularly in rural areas.  We have
asked the World Bank to support key investments in quality care, including basic reequipping of
rural primary health centers, development of continuing education programs for health personnel at
the primary level and establishment of quality assurance standards and monitoring. A critical
element will also be an affordable supply of essential drugs at the primary level, as described in
paras. 17-23 below. The core policy agenda will address staffing pattems for primary care as well
as the overall supply of health professionals in the system, as a main determinant of longer-run
financial sustainability.
Staffing of rural orimarv health centers. 250 rural primary health centers xwill receive
equipment packages under the proposed project. Of these, 150 are currentlv staffed with a full-
time phvsician, in addition to one or more nurses. These centers will be reequipped in 1996, and
remain staffed with a full-time physician throughout the 1996-99 period. Of the remaining 100
primarv health centers which are not staffed with a full-time physician, 50 have been selected by
the technical working group as requiring full-time physician services, based on the size of the
population served and proximity to other health services. We will redeplov existing public sector
staff in order to assign  full-time physicians to these 50 centers by June 30 1997.  This
redeployment will be a prerequisite to reequipping the remaining 100 rural primary health centers.
Creation of primary health care teams in urban areas. In urban areas, provision of
primarv care is excessively fragmented among a number of physicians and health professionals.
They tend to be overly-specialized according to patient age-groups, leading to inflexibility and
inefficiency in staff deployment. Pediatricians unnecessarilv limit themselves to treating either
ages 0-7 or 7-19, dentists focus on either of these age groups or adult care. Workplace physicians
duplicate basic primarv care services offered in free-standing clinics. We intend to simplify this
staffing structure, bs realigning public sector health personnel in urban areas into primarv health
care tcams. A primary liealth care team would consist of a core group of physicians--a general
practitioner, a pediatrician, an obstetrician-gynecologist and a dentist--plus associated nursing
persornel. The general practitioner would coordinate the primarv health care team, and serve as
primary physician for the purposes of referral to specialist services and hospital care. Other
specialist personnel would continue to offer consulting services by referral, but would fall outside
5



ANNEX 1
Page 6 of 15
the core primary health care team. A detailed plan for reorganization of primary care personnel
into primary health care teams will be prepared by December 31 1996, with implementation
completed by June 30, 1997.
Supply of health  professionals.  In order to ease fiscal constraints and prevent
unnecessary cost escalation through supplier-induced demand for health services, measures will be
taken to control the future numbers of physicians, dentists and pharmacists trained in the country.
We already offer no guarantee of public sector employment to graduating health professionals, and
this policy Will be maintained.  In addition, we will use attrition (normal retirement, voluntary
privatization, etc.) to reduce the net number of publicly-employed physicians (currently totaling
4,516) by at least 200 before June 30, 1998. In terms of future supply, we will invoke numerus
clausus for enrollment in medical training programs, in order to maintain adequate ratios of
medical professionals to population and reverse excessive expansion of enrollments in recent years.
Enrollment for physicians' training will be decreased from 120 in academic year 1996/97 bv 20
percent annually for the next three years (academic v'ears 1997/98, 1998/99 and 1999/2000). The
1999/2000 enrollment level is consistent with maintaining an adequate ratio of medical
professionals to population in the longer run, and will be extended over a longer period than the
proposed project implementation phase. If this limit of medical students per annum is maintained,
it would permit a ratio of 2.3 physicians per 1,000 inhabitants in the year 2010, given expected
demographic trends and attrition rates in the profession. This is close to the current ratio of 2.4
physicians per 1,000 inhabitants in our country, as well as to the current average for OECD
countries. If recent enrolLment rates of 150-200 students per annum were maintained, the ratio of
physicians to population would rise rapidly to around 2.6-2.7 by the vear 2010. For dentists' and
pharrnacists' training, average annual enrolLments have nearly doubled since 1991, and will be
reduced to an annual total of 75 students for dentistrv and 75 students for pharmacy for the
academic years 1996/97 through 1998/99 and beyond. Maintaining reasonable ratios will permrit
better remuneration of highly-trained health professionals--an expected trend as earnings diverge to
reflect skill levels in the market economy.
Disease prevention and health promotion. Long-term trends toward better health have
stagnated in recent years as a result of socioeconomic decline and reduced quality of health care
services and public health interventions. With an infant mortalitv rate which is twice the average
for Central and Eastem Europe and four times the average of Western Europe, and rapidly rising
rates of lifestyle-related chronic diseases (heart disease, cancer, chronic liver disease, etc.), it is
clear that improvements in health status in our country will depend on a renewed commitment to
disease prevention and health promotion. Our national prevention programs have been particularly
hard-hit by recent fiscal contraction. In 1993, legislation was adopted shifting funding of non-
salary material costs for national prevention programs to the general budget, to relieve financial
pressure on the Health Insurance Fund. However, budgetary allocations have been insufficient and
unfulfilled due to general fiscal distress. We have requested bridge financing under the proposed
IDA project to provide imported materials for five of the highest priority prevention programs: i)
Childhood Immunization, ii) Matemal and Child Health; iii) Tuberculosis Prevention, iv) AIDS
Prevention; and v) Blood Donation. In addition, we are committed to providing funding from the
general  budget for additional material and operating expenses (non-salary) for these five
programs, in the amounts of US$0.9 million equivalent in 1996, US$1.0 million equivalent in
1997 and US$1.2 million equivalent in 1998 for budget items agreed with IDA.  In addition to
these allocations, the general budget vill provide additional funding for the Childhood
Immunization Program, for timelv purchase of vaccines, syringes and needles as necessary.
Funding requirements are estimated at US$1.02 million equivalent in 1996, USS1.12 million
6



ANNEX 1
Page 7 of 15
equivalent in 1997 and US$1.23 million equivalent in 1998. These finds will be allocated from
the general budget, unless a firm commitment for external funding is obtained. UNICEF has
already indicated its willingness to provide vaccines, syringes and needles as necessary for the
Childhood Immunization Program in 1996 and 1997, and we will cooperate closely with UNICEF
to ensure continued extemal funding in 1998, as well. Thus, throughout the irutial phase of reform
(1996-99), wve are committed to providing budgetary or external funding to ensure immunization
coverage rates of 95 percent or higher for the full range of childhood communicable diseases
addressed under the Immnunization Program.
Pharmaceutical Policy and Supply
At an estimated three percent, the share of national income spent on drugs in our country is
among the highest in the world. More than half of this is financed by the public sector, through
HIF reimbursements. Spending is high because prescribing practices favor overconsumption, while
registration, procurement, pricing and reimbursement policies favor higher-prices specialtv drugs
and limit competition in the market. Local prices for drugs are frequently five to ten times higher
than comparable world market prices. Our goals for pharmaceutical reform in the next few years
are to reduce local prices for essential drugs, facilitate the introduction of high-quality, lower-cost
drugs, encourage more rational prescribing practices and place appropriate limits on public sector
reimbursement of drugs to both public and pnrvate sector suppliers. Reforms will focus on the
following areas: i) revision of the legislative franework. ii) streamnlined registration for equivalent
products and authorization of generic substitution; iii) implementation of pricing policv which
favors lower-cost drugs, iv) adoption of essential drug lists for public sector facilities and
reimbursement, v) introduction of a reference price reimbursement system, vi) development of
competitive bidding procedures for public sector bulk procurement. and vii) promotion of rational
prescribing practices.
Revision of the le2islative framework. The Drug Law wnill be revised to meet European
standards and to reflect the reform agenda described below wvith respect to registration;,
substitution, pricing and public sector procurement and reimbursement. A satisfactor., draft Drug
Law has been submitted to IDA, and will be presented to Parliament for a first reading in coming
months. as a condition of effectiveness for the Health Sector Transition Project
Streamlined registration for equivalent products and authorization of zeneric
substitution.   The Drug Law will be simplified to allow for faster registration of generic
equivalents and other synonymous substances, particularly through elimination of cumbersome
requirements for clinical trials (replaced by requirements for bioequivalencv testing), and
development of an abridged application procedure. No modification will be made to existing
qualitv standards and controls, ensuring that qualitv requirements remain high regardless of cost.
In addition, the Drug Law will be modified to authorize and encourage licensed pharmacists to
substitute lower-cost synonymous substances (e.g. generic or branded-generic drugs) for brand
name prescriptions, unless specificallk prohibited by the prescribing physician.
Implementation of pricin2 policies which favor lower-cost dru2s. The Drug Law will
be modified to eliminate the proposed 20 percent mark-up for drug wholesalers and retailers and
give the national drug authorities the flexibility to introduce prcing policies which favor low%er cost
drugs. The earlier proposal, a fixed-proportion mark-up based on production costs, encourages
both the inflation of production costs and the marketing of higher-priced drugs. The revised Drug
Law will be submitted to Parliament as a condition of effectiveness of the proposed project. The
7



ANNEX 1
Page 8 of 15
national drug authorities will then introduce a new pricing policy based on differential mark-ups
which favor essential and lower-cost drugs by June 30, 1977.
Adoption of essential dru2 lists for public sector facilities and reimbursement. The
MOH will issue a decree establishing essential drug lists for primary and hospital care in public
sector facilities.  The lists will be established through intensive preparation by our Drug
Com'ittee, which will also review the lists annually, updating as necessary. Procurement by
public sector facilities will be limited to the drugs on these lists, which are defined according to
their International Non-proprietary Names (INNs). Furthermore, reimbursement of drugs by the
1F will be limited on the basis of these essential drug lists. Adoption of the essential lists for
public sector procurement will take place by December 31, 1996. Limitations on the range of
drugs to be reimbursed by the HIF will go into effect, along with the introduction of reference price
reimbursement ceilings (see belowv), no later than December 31 1997, as part of a comprehensive
overhaul of HIF reimbursement policy.
Introduction of a reference price reimbursement system.    Ceilings for drug
reimbursement by -HF to health facilities and pharmacies will be established using reference prices
based on low-cost generic products. Additional costs for higher-priced brands will be borne out-of-
pocket by patients/customers in both public and private sector pharmacies.  Defining the
methodology for establishing reference prices will be the subject of a study carried out by HIF, to
be completed by June 30 1997.  Regulations establishing the reference price reimbursement
system, along *with limitations on the range of drugs to be reimbursed and revisions to copayment
policy for prescriptions will be adopted by December 31 1997, for immediate implementation.
Development of competitive biddine procedures for public sector bulk procurement.
Currently, drug procurement is carried out locally by individual public sector health facilities on a
relativelv small scale, wvith no common procedures to ensure competitive pricing. With essential
drug lists for public sector facilities in place, it will become easier to aggregate purchasing for the
public sector in order to reap the benefits of economies of scale.   We intend to introduce bulk
procurement for the public sector, and to carrv it out through a competitive bidding process to
ensure high quality at lower prices. Our Department of Pharmacv in the MOH will be responsible
for managing a training program to build capacity for competitive bulk procurement, vhile drafting
the regulations defining a public sector drug procurement process. These regulations will be
agreed with IDA, and adopted bv June 30 1997, with trial procurement according to regulation
(financed under the proposed IDA credit) taking place by December 31 1997. By June 30 1998,
all public sector purchases which can be grouped into bulk lots will be procured through this
competitive process. wvhile health facilities will be required to engage in comparative pricing for
small-scale procurement of non-standard items.
Promotion of rational grescribine Dractices. We intend to establish a National Drug
Information Center (NDIC) which would act as a clearinghouse for international information on
pharmaceutical products. as well as direct information campaigns aimed at prescriber, pharmacists
and the public. The NDIC wvould be established by December 31 1996, and would be responsible,
inter alha, for educating physicians and pharmacists on the benefits of prescribing bv lnternational

Non-proprietary Name, permitting generic substitution and following optimal prescribing practices.
It would also inform the public about lower-cost pharmaceutical alternatives. In addition, the HIF
will do periodic analysis of prescribing patterns for drugs on the reimbursement list, identifying
and recommending changes in poor prescribing practices.
Based on the policies and actions described in this Letter, we would like to request IDA's
support for our health sector reform progran through a credit for the Health Sector Transition
Project in an amount of US$16.9 million equivalent.

Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
Health Sector Transition Project
Proiect lmvlementation Plan
Introduction
This Project Implementation Plan (PIP) reflects the outcomes of the October 1995 pre-
appraisal mission and its work with the technical working groups of the Ministry of
Health (MOH)'/, as well as subsequent discussions between the MOH and the Bank in
December 1995 concerning further refinements to project scope and content. It was
discussed with the Borrower and refinements made during negotiations in May 1996.
The PIP presents the overall framework for implementation of the Project by the
Borrower and outlines in detail activities, arrangements and responsibilities. While the
implementation environment of the project is inherently dynamic, this PIP seeks to
clearly outline the general principles, agreed by all parties, according to which the project
will be carried out.
A list of working group members is given in Appendix 1.

I. Project Description. Objectives and Components
1.            The primary objectives of the Health Sector Transition Project are to: (i) improve the
health of the population by improving the quality of basic health services; and (ii) support an initial phase
of policy reforms to enhance cost-effectiveness, fiscal sustainability and patient choice within the health
system. These objectives will be achieved through activities and reforms under three project components
with the specific objectives outlined below:
(a)    Health Finance and Management: to support (i) the Government's efforts to prepare
and implement health financing reforms, building on technical work begun during project
preparation, through policy studies and advocacy/public information campaigns; and
(ii) the future introduction of a case-mix hospital reimbursement scheme through
development and testing of an integrated medical and financial management information
system for public sector facilities.
(b)    Basic Health Services: to improve the quality and effectiveness of primary health care
services through (i) the provision of basic equipment kits to 250 rural health centers and
support for clinicians' continuing education in provision and management of care; and
(ii) support for selected prevention programs.
(c)    Pharmaceutical Policy and Supply : to promote more rational use of drugs through
(i) strengthening local capacity for competitive drug procurement; and (ii) developing
essential drugs lists for public sector health facilities.
The project will finance local and external technical assistance, local training, long- and short-term
fellowships and study tours, medical and laboratory testing and diagnostic equipment and supplies,
computer hardware and software, reference materials, office equipment, furniture, and minor civil works
to support the activities described below.
II. Project Management and Implementation
A. Project Management
2.            Overall responsibility for implementation of Health Sector Transition Project rests
with the MOH, while responsibility for day-to-day coordination, management and monitoring rests
with the International Project Unit (IPU) established within the MOH. It is expected that the IPU
will also assume responsibility for the coordination of other donor-funded activities in the health
sector. In order to carry out its functions, the Unit will be staffed by a full-time Project Director,
supported by a "core team", financed under the project. This core team is comprised of: (i) a
procurement officer; (ii) a disbursement officer/accountant; and (iii) an administrative
assistant/translator. To assist this team, short-term technical support for the IPU will be provided for
under the project in a number of areas, inter alia, health policy development, procurement of goods
and services, project management, and administrative support services.

3.            Details concerning support to the IPU and estimated costs are presented in the table
below. Initial start-up costs for appointment of key staff (i.e., the Director and the Procurement
Officer), equipment of the Unit, and staff training in procurement and project management are being
financed by a Project Preparation Facility (PPF; P983-0-MK) of US$223,500.

C. ImDlementation Arrangements by Component
5.            The paragraphs below discuss implementation arrangements for each of the three
components of the project. Detailed cost tables and implementation schedules related to the specific
components are found in Section D.



ANNEX 2
Page 9 of 65
COMPONENT (1): Health Finance and Management
6.            Overall responsibility for implementation of this component lies with the National Health
Insurance Fund (NHIF), a semi-autonomous fund under the supervision of the MOH, the director of
which reports to the Minister of Health. The NHIF will take principal responsibility for defining and
implementing the reforms supported under the project. In that capacity, the Fund will manage and
supervise the work of the foreign and local experts hired to carry out technical studies under the
component. The NHIF will coordinate and supervise the pilot activities (in capitation payment, integrated
information systems, etc.) in the two selected districts, collaborating with the District HIF (DHIF) offices,
the medical centers, PHC centers and District Institutes of Public Health. The Fund will also be
responsible for identifying qualified fellowship and study tour candidates to be trained as trainers for
outreach to DHIF and facilities' staff on issues concerning financial and administrative management.
Implementation of this local management training through seminars will be coordinated by the NHIF.
With respect to information system activities, the NHIF will oversee the work of the foreign and local
technical assistance hired to support the design of an integrated information system, the formulation of
an automation plan, and coordination of testing in selected pilot areas. Lastly, in collaboration with the
IPU, the NHIF will oversee the development of a public information and outreach strategy with respect
to the content and implementation of reforms.
7.            The Technical Committee (TC) for this component (formally the technical working
group established during project preparation) will be headed by the director of the NHIF. The TC will
play an important role in reviewing the series of technical studies regarding proposed reforms, and
making final recommendations to the MOH on the policy reforms. The Committee will advise and assist
the IPU in developing technical specifications for goods to be procured under this component, as well
as terms of reference for consultants. Finally, the TC will supervise the work of technical assistance to
establish a Hospital Management Association which, once operational, will develop and carry out training
programs for medical professionals. Technical assistance will be provided under the project to give initial
support to the Association in this task.
8.            Under the project, pilot activities are foreseen in two selected districts (selection of
suitable pilots districts is a condition of negotiation). The DHIF offices of the pilots areas will oversee
implementation of activities, reporting to the NHIF. The DHIFs will also coordinate the distribution of
equipment to be procured for carrying out pilot activities, and together with the selected medical centers,
primary health care centers and the district offices of the IPH will be responsible for any necessary site
preparation (i.e., installation of phone lines, electrical connections, etc. for hardware) and actual
implementation of activities.
COMPONENT (2): Basic Health Services
9.            Primary responsibility for implementation of this component lies with the Office of the
Assistant Minister for Primary and Preventive Health Care (AMPPHC). This Office will supervise
the work of the procurement agency, in collaboration with the IPU, hired to ensure the purchase and
distribution of: (i) basic medical equipment kits for rural primary health centers (PHCs) (to be purchased
from UNIPAC) as well as other equipment and furniture for rural PHCs (the latter being financed by the
Government); and (ii) various medical consumables, vaccines, and promotional supplies needed for



ANNEX 2

prevention programs supported under the project.3/ The AMPPHC will be responsible for selecting
qualified candidates from within the MOH for training in primary health care strategies and planning, and
will supervise the development of continuing education programs for PHC physicians and nursing staff.
Finally, the Office will develop final recommendations to the MOH on quality assurance standards for
PHC and will approve any action plan for quality assurance monitoring and supervision.
10.          In developing continuing education programs aimed at broadening the skills of PHC
personnel, the medical associations (Physicians' and Nurses' Associations) and related medical faculties
(physicians' and nursing faculties) will play a key role. These programs will seek to give greater
emphasis to a family medicine orientation in medical education, and to primary and secondary prevention
strategies. In addition, these associations and faculties will take the primary role in defining--for
presentation to the Office of the AMPPHC--the action plan for primary care quality assurance monitoring
and supervision mentioned in the preceding paragraph.
II.          Implementation of activities supporting priority prevention programs under the project
will be the responsibility of the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH), reporting to the Office of
the AMPPHC. The NIPH will assume direct responsibility for carrying out immunization program
activities, maternal and child health care programs (namely, cervical cancer screening and neonatal
intensive care support in conjunction with the University Hospital), and AIDS screening activities
provided for under the project. The Institute will also supervise implementation of project inputs in
tuberculosis screening and prevention, and blood donation program support through, respectively, the
National Institutes of Lung Diseases and Tuberculosis and Blood Transfusion. Through representation
on the TC for basic health services (see below), the NIPH will provide inputs to related equipment
specifications and consultancy terms of reference under this component. Responsibility for receipt and
distribution of medical consumables and equipment for implementation of prevention programs will also
lie with the Institute, as will ensuring the development and dissemination of promotional materials for
each program.
12.          The TC for basic health services will be chaired by the Assistant Minister for Primary
and Preventive Health Care, and will be comprised of representatives from each of the agencies involved
in carrying out the programs supported under the project (see preceding paragraph). The Committee will
also provide technical support to the IPU in formulating consultant terms of reference, finalizing
equipment specifications, and inputs to the development and use of promotional materials.
COMPONENT (3): Pharmaceutical Policy and SUPDIV
13.          The Department of Pharmaceuticals (DoP) in the MOH will have overall responsibility
for implementation of this component. It will play a key role in the reform process, managing each of
the successive steps of legislative revision and definition of the regulatory framework concerning drug
registration, pricing, and substitution. While the NHIF will take the lead in managing technical assistance
for the definition of a reference price reimbursement system for drugs, and for testing and implementing
3/     The role of the procurement agency in the competitive procurement of pharmaceuticals for the
public sector is discussed under Component (3), Pharmaceutical Supply.



ANNEX 2
Page 11 of 65
that system, the DoP will provide inputs throughout the process. Moreover, the DoP will take the lead
role in the formulation of public sector competitive bidding procedures for the procurement of drugs and
vaccines, including management of training for concerned staff in those procedures. The Department
will also be responsible for managing the consultants carrying out technical studies pertaining to the
reforms, developing essential drug lists, as well as promoting rational drug use among prescribers and
consumers in collaboration with the Drug Information Center to be established in the Institute of
Pharmacy (see para. 14 below).
14.           With respect to drug procurement, the DoP will supervise the work of the contracted
procurement agency selected to procure and distribute drugs, medical equipment and consumables under
the project according to competitive bidding procedures. The procurement agency, to be selected as a
condition of effectiveness, will be fully equipped for, and experienced in, accepting and processing
orders, and ensuring secure warehousing and timely distribution of items purchased through large-scale
procurement.
15.           The National Drug Information Center and the Center for Adverse Reactions will be
established and operated under the responsibility of the Institute of Pharmacy (Faculty of Medicine).
The Institute will ensure that necessary site preparation is carried out prior to arrival of equipment,
finalize specifications for required equipment with the IPU, identify and request, with assistance from the
IPU, appropriate drug information reference materials, and appoint qualified staff to both Centers. A
public information strategy for drugs will also be developed with some assistance from WHO in addition
to support provided under the project. The NIPH will oversee the development of the quality control
laboratory, including provision of support to the IPU on technical specifications for lab equipment, site
preparation, and the selection of qualified candidates for training to be carried out.
16.           The TC for pharmaceuticals will review proposals put forward by the technical consultants
and finalize recommendations for pharmaceutical policy reform for Ministerial improvement. This will
include recommendations on: drug registration, essential lists, pricing policy, registration and testing,
substitution policy, reimbursement, and public sector procurement.

III. Project Cost and Financing, Procurement Arrangements,
and Disbursements
A. Project Cost and Financing
17.          Total project cost is estimated at US$19.4 million (or MKD 737 million equivalent)
including contingencies. An estimated US$16.9 million equivalent (or 87% of total costs) will be
financed by the IDA credit of SDR 11.8 million (including a PPF (P-983-0-MK) totalling US$0.2 million
equivalent). The Credit will finance 100% of the estimated foreign exchange cost (US$14.5 million) and
48 % of estimated local costs (US$2.4 million). The remaining 13 % of total project costs will be financed
by the Government (US$2.5 million). All imported goods and services destined for health institutions
and related purposes--including those financed under the Project--are exempt from taxation and customs
duties. Any local taxes which may be incurred on locally purchased project items will be financed by
the Government.  Incremental recurrent costs included in the project (estimated US$0.3 million)
comprising operating costs, equipment maintenance service contracts, incremental staff salaries, and
supplies will be financed by the Government. A PPF (P-983-0-MK) of US$223,500 is supporting the
establishment of the IPU and training of IPU staff; and a PHRD Grant financed by the Government of
Japan totalling US$0.6 million equivalent has been used to support project preparation, including
preparatory studies for health financing reform.
18.          Estimated project costs by component are shown below  in Table 1 (MKD and
lS$equivalent). Table 2 presents project costs by expenditure category (including contingencies).

20.   Basis for cost estimates. Cost estimates are derived from those assumed under other projects in
the Eastern and Central Europe Region, including FYR Macedonia. Additional sources include relevant
equipment catalogues and supplier quotations, as well as technical estimates for applications software and
hardware. Estimates for consultant and training costs also reflect experiences in the Region. Incremental
staff salaries included in the project are based on current government rates. Project costs have been
estimated in US dollars, with the local equivalent calculated on the basis of the February 1996 exchange
rate of 38 MKD/US$1.
21.   Contingency Allowances. Project costs include contingencies for unforeseen physical variations
(totalling US$1.2 million) equivalent to 5% for technical assistance and training, and 10% for other
project items. Annual inflation of 2.4% is assumed for both foreign and local costs during the three-year
implementation period.
22.   Foreign Exchange Component. The foreign exchange component is estimated at about US$14.5



ANNEX 2
Page 29 of 65
million including contingencies, or 75% of total project cost. Calculations of the foreign exchange
component are based on the following assumptions: (i) 100% for medical equipment and supplies,
reference materials, computer software and hardware, external technical assistance and training; (ii) 60%
for office equipment; (iii) 90% for vehicles; and (iv) 0% for furniture, local technical assistance and
training.
23.    Customs Duties and Taxes. The Ministry of Finance has confirmed that imported goods destined
for health-related institutions and purposes are exempt from taxes and duties. However, locally purchased
medical and computer equipment is taxed at 5%; and office equipment at 25%. Under the project, it is
expected that most medical and computer equipment will be imported, as will most office equipment (with
the exception of about US$400,000 of goods purchased through local shopping). Given the small amount
involved, no estimation of taxes has been included in project costs. The Borrower does recognize that
it will be responsible for meeting all duty and/or tax obligations should they arise.
24.   Incremental Recurrent Costs. Project cost estimates include US$0.3 million (2% of total project
cost) in incremental operating costs attributable to the Project during the three-year period. These costs
comprise equipment operation and maintenance, minor operating expenses and supplies, and incremental
staff salaries. Annual incremental operating costs are estimated at MKD 5.0 million or less than 1% of
the recurrent health budget. These costs will be more than compensated for through a number of
measures being undertaken by the MOH, inter alia, savings generated by competitive procurement of
pharmaceuticals and reductions in public funding for medical training.
B. Procurement Arrangements and Schedule
25.    Project inputs, estimated costs, and proposed procurement arrangements for those inputs
financed under the IDA Credit are summarized in Table 5 below. Incremental recurrent costs, civil
works, and furniture, all of which are financed 100% by Government counterpart funds, are shown
under the Non-Bank Financed (NBF) column.

26.    Civil works (including site preparation for information system pilots, neonatal care unit, and drug
control laboratory and animal house) totalling an estimated US$0.8 million will be financed entirely by
the Government and procured according to its procedures.
27.    Goods to be procured include medical and laboratory equipment and supplies, drugs and
consumables, computer hardware and software, office equipment, furniture, promotional materials for
prevention programs, and vehicles (one mobile clinic for tuberculosis screening, and one vehicle for
cancer screening activities).
28.    Furniture amounting to about US$0.6 million will be financed by the Government and procured
through relevant local procedures. For other goods under the project, equipment contracts of a value
exceeding US$200,000 equivalent per contract will be procured following International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with the IDA's "Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans
and IDA Credits" (January 1995). Equipment and supplies will be grouped into a small number of
packages (about nine) to be procured through ICB to encourage competitive bidding and permit bulk
procurement, including: laboratory and diagnostic equipment and supplies (two packages); neonatal
intensive care unit equipment; other medical equipment; replacement x-ray equipment; drugs and
consumables; reproductive health supplies (including contraceptives); mobile clinic for tuberculosis
screening; and computer hardware. Computer hardware and peripherals (representing about US$1.3
million) will be procured with careful consideration of compatibility and availability of maintenance
services. Equipment procured through ICB will account for about 70% (US$9.4 million) of total goods
to be procured under the project. Domestic preference would not be applied.
29.   Other procurement procedures. Contracts for equipment estimated to cost less than US$200,000
per contract, not to exceed an aggregate amount of US$0.6 million equivalent, will be awarded through
International Shopping (IS) procedures, based on comparing price quotations obtained from at least
three suppliers from two eligible countries in accordance with IDA guidelines. Items that cannot be
grouped, or groups of items estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$50,000 per contract, or off-
the-shelf items, amounting to about US$0.4 million, will be awarded through National Shopping (NS)
by comparing price quotations obtained from at least three local suppliers, in accordance with IDA
Guidelines. About US$2.2 million in basic medical equipment (e.g., stethoscopes, scales) destined for
rural primary health centers will be purchased as catalogue items from UNIPAC (UNICEF). Other
contracts for goods which IDA agrees are of proprietary nature (e.g., unique reference materials,
technical manuals, software), amounting to about US$0.1 million may be awarded after direct
negotiations with suppliers, in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA.
30.    Consultants for technical assistance services financed under the project (totalling about US$2.2
million) will be selected in accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing Agency" (August 1981). It is estimated that five
packages for technical assistance will be required (see Procurement Schedule in Table 6 below), including
specialist services for: health financing and management, reference pricing, pharmaceutical advisory
services, procurement and distribution services (financed by Government), as well as project management
support. As needed, the services of individual specialists (e.g., to develop computer applications software
or technical specifictions for medical equipment) (estimated total value US$250,000) will also be
contracted on the basis of shortlists of eligible candidates and comparison of at least three curricula vitae.

Local training under the project is estimated at US$0.5 million, and external training at US$1.2 million.
Approximately US$0.7 million of this training under the Health Finance & Management Component will
be provided as one component of the related consultant services contract. For other external training,
institutions will be selected through shortlisting in accordance with IDA procedures.

32.    In compliance with IDA procedures, standard bidding documents will be used for all ICB
procurement. IDA will review all final equipment lists, technical specifications, packaging of bids, and
updated package values. With respect to contracts for goods estimated to cost US$200,000 or more, the
procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Appendix I of the Guidelines shall apply. Prior review
(including requests for direct contracting) is expected to cover over 85 % of the total estimated base cost
for goods procured under the project. Remaining contracts will be subject to selective post award review.
Consultant contracts, with the exception of contracts with firms not exceeding US$100,000 each in value,
and for individuals not exceeding US$50,000 each in value, will be subject to prior review. The Bank
will, however, review terms of reference, short lists, and consultants' profiles for all individual
consultants.
33.    The IPU will coordinate and monitor all procurement activities for goods and services under the
project, including tracking of those activities carried out by the selected agent for procurement and
distribution of drugs and consumables. In addition, information technology equipment will be procured
with the assistance of external experts under the related subcomponents, in collaboration with the IPU.
Short-term technical assistance (both external and local) is included in the project to assist the IPU in
performing these functions, including preparation of bidding documents and technical specifications. The
procurement officer has already received training in equipment procurement funded under the PPF, and
further training for IPU core staff in procurement and project management principles is foreseen under
the project. The IPU will also be responsible for informing IDA of contract awards, and would include
the following procurement-related information in periodic progress reports: (a) updated cost estimates,
by component and category of expenditure, for the project; (b) updated procurement timetable for goods
and equipment; and (c) status of aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement.
34.    Procurement and distribution of drugs, consumables, and medical equipment for rural primary
health centers will be carried out by the local procurement agency selected by the Government. It is
envisaged that procurement of these items will be carried out in accordance with IDA's Guidelines for
Procurement (January 1995). The MOH will enter into a cont-act with the selected agency to ensure the
procurement and distribution of these items, and all fees related to performance of these services will be
financed by the Government (an estimated US$0.8 million) as part of its counterpart contribution to the
project. Signing of this agreement, the provisions of which will be acceptable to IDA, is a condition of
effectiveness.
35.    A General Procurement Notice was prepared and finalized for publication during negotiations (see
Appendix 3). A Project Launch Workshop will be held prior to effectiveness (tentatively scheduled for
July 1996).
C. Disbursements, Special Account, and Audit Requirements
36.    Disbursements. The proposed Project is expected to be disbursed over a period of three years,
considerably shorter than the relevant sector profile in the Region of about seven years. This project is
the second operation in the human resources sectors in the FYR Macedonia, the first having become
effective less than one year ago. Therefore, the country disbursement profile is speculative. However,
the shorter implementation period for the present project reflects the nature of the project as a source of



ANNEX 2
Page 35 of 65
bridge financing during the initial stages of the transition and in support of the first phase of the
Government's health reform program, as well as the simplicity of the project's design. The closing date
will be March 31, 2000. Estimated disbursements are shown in Table 7 below.
Table 7: Estimated Disbursements by Year
(US$rnillion)
IDA Fiscal Year             1996            1997        1998

Cumulative as % of total    37.0           85.0         100.0
The IDA credit will be disbursed as follows:
(a)    for equipment: 100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of ex-factory local costs, and 85%
of other items procured locally;
(b)    for technical assistance, local and external training: 100% of all expenditures; and
(c)    repayment of PPF.
All disbursements will be fully documented with the exception of: (i) goods contracts of a value less than
US$200,000 equivalent; (ii) contracts with consulting firms of a value less than US$100,000 equivalent
and with individual consultants of a value less than US$50,000; and (iii) local training--for which
disbursements will be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). The required supporting
documentation will be retained by the IPU for at least one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit
report for the year in which the last disbursement was made. This documentation will be made available
for review by the auditors and by visiting staff upon request.  The responsibility for monitoring
disbursements of the IDA credit, as well as Government counterpart financing, will lie with the IPU.
37.    Special Accoun.. To facilitate project implementation, the Government has established, under
terms and conditions acceptable to IDA, a Special Account in US Dollars in the National Bank of
Macedonia. Payments for eligible expenditures may be made by the IPU out of this account. The
Special Account will have a total authorized allocation of US$1.0 million. The initial deposit will amount
to US$500,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Credit Account plus the total amount
of all outstanding special commitments shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of US$5.0 million. The
Special Account will be replenished on a monthly basis or whenever the undisbursed balance falls below
an amount equal to 50% or less of Authorized Allocation, whichever occurs first. Monthly bank
statements of the Special Account which have been reconciled by the Borrower will accompany all
replenishment requests. The Special Account funds should be used for all payments of a value less than
20% of the Authorized Allocation.
38.    Audit Requirements. The IPU will maintain separate accounts, in conformity with international
accounting practices. Project accounts, including the Special Account, will be audited in accordance with
the Bank's "Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank"
(March 1982). The Borrower will provide to IDA (within six months of the end of each fiscal year) an
audit report of such scope and detail as IDA may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by an
independent auditor acceptable to the Bank on disbursements against certified SOEs. The separate



ANNEX 2
Page 36 of 65
opinion should mention whether the SOEs submitted during the fiscal year, together with the procedures
and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawal
applications.
D. Reporting Requirements
39.    The PCU will prepare semi-annual descriptive and financial reports on each project component,
objective and activity (beginning from the date of Credit Effectiveness). These reports will be due in
January and July of each year, and will describe: (a) current status; (b) deviations, if any, from the
implementation plan; and (c) the reasons for deviations and corrective actions being taken. These reports,
in addition to the SAR and PIP, will form the basic documents for supervision of the project. Project
reporting, as well as supervision, will also focus on in-depth reviews of the agreed policy agenda (see
Letter of Development Policy, Annex I to the SAR), the consistency of activities for each component and
subcomponent with agreements reached at negotiations, performance of the implementing agencies,
assessment of emerging needs for adjustments to project parameters, and possible follow-up operations
which could be supported by the Bank. Project supervision will also include a review of project
expenditures and availability of financial resources, substantive discussions with technical assistance
groups implementing and/or assisting in the implementation of various components, and discussions with
responsible authorities. A mid-term review of progress under the project will be conducted by IDA and
the Borrower by March 31, 1998.
E. Supervision Requirements
40.    Supervision. Recognizing that the Health Sector Transition Project is a first generation project
in the health sector in FYR Macedonia, and that the implementing agency and related institutions have
no previous experience in carrying out an investment project of this magnitude, the supervision effort
required during the initial phases of implementation will inevitably be higher than average. Furthermore,
in planning for project supervision, it is important to distinguish between time spent on routine
supervision matters, and time spent providing substantive policy advice to the Government and other
institutions on implementing its reform agenda. In the given implementation environment, the provision
of both types of assistance will put a heavy demand on resources.
41.    Table 8 below provides an estimate of the volume and type of supervision inputs envisaged under
the project. Resident Mission support through local staff is not presently feasible since the Resident
Mission in Skopje is newly established. However, once operationally staffed and trained, efforts will be
made to involve local staff in supervision activities. Delegation of specific supervision responsibilities
to permanent field staff would likely not be feasible until at least the second year of the project, with
substantive and operational backstopping support continuing to be provided by Headquarters staff and/or
the Budapest Human Resource Hub.

IV. Monitoring And Evaluation
Project Monitoring
42.    Monitoring is a continual process of assessing whether project resources (inputs) are being used
as planned to carry out project activities (outputs). Monitoring the use of project resources will be done
by tracking inputs according to component, activity and expenditure category, as outlined in Table 9:
Input Indicators. Updated disbursement information will be provided in this format in the project's semi-
annual Progress Reports, to be prepared by the IPU. Monitoring outputs under the project is more
complex, involving both implementation of project activities and implementation of the broader policy
reform agenda. For the former, completion of key project activities will be monitored as indicated in
Table 10: Output Indicators, and summarized in the semi-annual Progress Reports. For the latter,
progress in implementing reforms will be jointly assessed by Government and IDA on an annual basis.
A timetable of expected progress, with carefully defined progress benchmarks, has been summarized in
the policy matrix attached to the Government's Letter of Development Policy (Annex 1).
Project Evaluation
42.    Evaluation is a process of assessing the extent to which a project achieves its objectives. The
objectives of the Health Sector Transition Project aim to affect outcomes related to health status, services
and financing. Broad outcome indicators have been selected in each of these areas. The indicators were
selected on the basis of relevance to the project objectives, sensitivity to project activities, ease of data
collection and parsimony. It is recognized that changes in most of these indicators cannot be causally
linked directly to project activities, since the project is only one of multiple factors impacting on health
status and services during the short (three-year) implementation period. However, annual monitoring of
these indicators will provide evidence of overall trends in the health status of the population, the
effectiveness of health services and the efficiency of public spending for health--all of which the project
seeks to influence positively.

APPENDIX 2: MATRIX OF PROCUREMENT AND REPORTING RESPONSBIILITIES
The following matrix seeks to clarify responsibilities for key steps in procurement and reporting during
implementation among the various players involved in the project. The following definitions are used
in the matrix:
(a)    International Project Unit (IPU) refers to the unit in the MOH responsible for the
general administration of the credit and coordination of project activities. The IPU is
comprised of a project director, procurement officer, disbursement officer/accountant,
and administrator/translator. The IPU may be supported by short-term consultants in
specific areas in order that it be able to more efficiently fulfill its role.
(b)    Technical Committee (TC) refers to the technical working groups established during
project preparation for each subcomponent and maintained throughout implementation to
provide technical support to the IPU.
The IPU is encouraged to organize regular meetings of representatives of the TCs, as well as any other
individuals involved in project activities both within and outside of the MOH, in order to keep all parties
up-to-date on project status and identify obstacles earlv on in order to seek mutually agreeable solutions.
Meetings should ideally be organized around an established agenda, with time allotted for questions or
other open discussion. The IPU Director will be responsible for keeping the Minister of Health informed
of the outcome of these meetings, and will seek his guidance in resolving issues if necessary.

GENERAL PROCUREMENT NOTICE
FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
HEALTH SECTOR TRANSITION PROJECT
The Government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia) is expected to
receive a Credit from the International Development Association (IDA) in an amount equivalent to SDR 11.8
million (US$16.9 million equivalent) to support a Health Sector Transition Project. The objectives of the
project are to improve the health of the population by improving the quality of basic health services, and to
support an initial phase of policy reforms to enhance cost-effectiveness, fiscal sustainability and patient choice
within the health system.
The project is comprised of the following components:
(a)    Health Finance and Management: to support (i) the Government's efforts to prepare and implement
health financing reforms, building on technical work begun during project preparation, through policy
studies and advocacy/public information campaigns; and (ii) the future introduction of a case-mix
hospital reimbursement scheme through development and testing of an integrated medical and
financial management information system for public sector facilities.
(b)    Basic Health Services: to improve the quality and effectiveness of primary health care services
through (i) the provision of basic equipment kits to 250 rural health centers and support for clinicians'
continuing education in provision and management of care; and (ii) support for selected prevention
programs.
(c)    Pharmaceutical Policy and Supply: to promote more rational use of drugs through (i) strengthening
local capacity for competitive drug procurement; and (ii) developing essential drugs lists for public
sector health facilities.
The Government intends to apply the proceeds of the Credit to finance local and foreign technical
assistance, local training as well as long- and short-term fellowships and study tours, medical equipment and
supplies, computer hardware and software, reference materials, and office equipment, in support of the above
components. All goods and services to be procured under the project would be tendered through procedures
in accordance with the procurement guidelines of the International Development Association. Among the
items to be procured through International Competitive Bidding are laboratory testing and diagnostic
equipment, medical equipment and consumables, selected pharmaceutical products, and computer hardware
and software. Advertisement of initial tenders is expected by December 1996.

ANNEX 3
Page I of 6
Selection Amona Alternative Project Designs
1.     The project's objectives--to improve the health of the population by enhancing the quality of basic
health services and support an initial phase of policy reforms to increase cost-effectiveness, fiscal
sustainability and patient choice within the health system--complement and help achieve the Government's
overall economic reform strategy. The Government has sought to maintain basic social services in order
to maintain stability and avoid entanglement in the war in the former Yugoslavia while beginning the
process of building a modern growing economy. The Government has been successful in achieving this
goal in spite of a recent assassination attempt on the President's life. The proposed project supports this
effort by preventing the deterioration in basic health services and beginning the process of policy change
that is necessary to build an efficient, high-quality health care system.
2.     The proposed project has three components. Alternatives considered for each component are
presented below and are evaluated in terms of achieving the project's objectives.  Assessment of
alternatives to health care investment--such as education--were beyond the scope of the work undertaken
for this project, but were considered by Government in defining priorities for World Bank assistance.
As a practical matter, the Government has weighed sector alternatives and selected this project as one that
meets its overall policy objectives and criteria for World Bank assistance.
3.    In all cases the status quo is used as one alternative and depending on the component or sub-
component other reasonable alternatives were considered. Factors which determined the selection of the
proposed activities included, in no particular order: 1) programs most likely to achieve the project's
objectives; 2) activities that lay the foundation for sustained change; 3) alternatives likely to be achieved
within the budget and human resource constraints of the country and the health care system; 4) the cost-
effectiveness of the alternatives; and 5) politic.al and implementation feasibility.
Component 1: Health Finance and Managemnent
4.     Activities in Component I consist of 1) health financing reforms, 2) information systems, and 3)
building the technical capacity of the NHIF and health care managers.
Health Financing Reforms
5.     All of the health financing reforms are interrelated, and along with the other activities are
designed as a package to lead to a more efficient health care financing system.  Many of these
investments, such as the accounting and information systems, lay the ground work for the adoption of
new ways to pay for services which relate costs to services provided, and which introduce incentives in
the system for efficient and effective behavior by health care providers. The ultimate success of these
policy reforms can be measured by indicators of efficiency (e.g. length of stay and costs per patient day)
and quality (e.g. readmission rates, infection rates, and patient satisfaction).
6.     Revision of user fees - The first policy reform envisions revision of the user fees and co-payment
policy. A technical study will be followed by specific reform options including a reevaluation of
exemptions granted and the establishment of lump sum user fees. Exemptions under the present system
are extremely broad, and subject to abuse, leading to inequity in the application of fees, and exacerbating



ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 6
the complexity of administration. While copayments of insured patients, and to a larger extent, user fees
from the uninsured (many firms are failing to pay insurance contributions for workers, creating a large
pool of uninsured) have contributed to the revenues of health facilities (10-15 percent of total revenues
in recent years), the present system has generated discontent due to its inequitable application and impact
on access to care.
7.     The status quo offers no advantages over the proposed project. The proposed project will study
the issue, and then implement an administratively simpler and more equitable system for revenue
collection. The level of revenue collection can be set where policy desires within a far simpler system
to administer. The by-product will be the establishment of incentives for efficiency of health care use
in conformity with project objectives. Alternative structures of the user fee--i.e., a percentage of health
care fees versus a lump sum fee--will be consider during the technical analysis. Finally this is an area
identified for reform by the MOH. As such, it will enjoy the political support of the MOH and be
implemented aggressively in spite of expected resistance from the broad group of currently exempted
patients.
8.     Definition of a fiscally-sustainable benefits package for coverage by the NHIF - The objective
here is to define what is fundable given the limited budget of the NHIF. Instead of claiming to fund
everything, this reform will define what should be covered as the basic package by the NHIF, based on
the burden of disease and cost effectiveness of treatment, while establishing a supplemental benefits
package--and appropriate supplemental premium--for other services. A basic benefits package will be
defined which will prevent additional accumulation of financial arrears and allow gradual elimination of
the existing stock of arrears.  This is a first step in ensuring that basic services which prevent
deterioration in health status are insured, while beginning to establish a relationship between payment,
incentives, and the cost of services. This is essential to achieve the goal of efficient provision of care.
The alternative--i.e. the status quo--has nothing to recommend it. Instead it will continue the situation
where resource use is unrelated to real economic costs or the provision of efficient, high-quality care.
Expenditure control will remain impossible, leading to continued buildup of financial arrears in the health
sector (arrears accumulated every year since 1990 equal MKD 1.4 billion--about 12 percent of total health
expenditures in 1995). Until this situation is changed the objectives of the project cannot be met. This
is a first but necessary step to establish a financing system that promotes efficient high quality care.
9.     Adoption of a capitation payment system for primary care - The alternatives considered were the
status quo or movement to a fee-for-service payment system. The status quo consists of predominantly
public sector primary health care services, which have no separate budgetary allocation. Primary health
centers lie at the bottom of a budgeting hierarchy--and are, therefore, shortchanged--with funding
provided largely according to staffing, rather than services provided or patients served. No benefits
package has been defined which primary care centers are expected to provide, and there is no functional
means of allowing patient choice and development of private sector alternatives to public sector care.
These problems, coupled with recent resource constraints, have resulted in low quality care, and a
tendency for patients to bypass the primary care system altogether, leading to inappropriate use of high-
cost hospital facilities. Thus, continuation of the status quo is an inefficient and ineffective use of health
resources.
10.    Another alternative is to move to a fee-for-service payment system, often favored by the medical
profession. Such systems in other countries have led to supplier-induced demand for services (i.e.
doctors supplying unnecessary services about which patients are unable to make informed judgments),



ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 6
resulting in cost escalation. Indeed, FYR Macedonia already has a legally-mandated system of payment
for providers modeled on the German points system of fees for services. Since 1991, the NHIF has
attempted to reimburse private sector providers--mostly for primary and other ambulatory services--on
this basis. Attempts have been largely abandoned due to uncontrolled cost escalation and perceived abuse
of the system. False Llaims for reimbursement, excessive supply of services and a general inability of
NHIF to verify claims has brought fee-for-service payments to a halt.
11.    The project will support devzlopment of a capitation payment mechanism for primary care. Such
a system has the following advantages over the alternatives examined: i) a defined benefits package which
all primary care providers must offer; ii) creation of a separate budget allocation for primary care within
the NHIF; iii) a predetermined financial outflow (enhancing fiscal sustainability) which transfers financial
risk to providers, creating incentives for efficient care; iv) funds following patients, allowing patients'
choice of primary care provider, thereby creating incentives for quality care; v) equal remuneration of
public and private sector providers, stimulating private sector development. A capitation mechanism,
which allows funds to follow patients, is the equivalent of giving vouchers to patients to purchase their
package of primary care benefits. It is an overall demand-side approach to stimulating the provision of
appropriate primary  health services.   The project supports this broad demand-side approach,
complemented with narrower supply-side interventions where necessary (see Component II: Basic Health
Services, below).
Integrated Medical and Financial Information System
12.    The design, testing and introduction of a medical and financial information system at the hospital
level, linked to the NHIF and including enhanced reporting, are key activities of Component 1. The
status quo offers no accounting system that links economic costs to inputs employed or outputs provided.
Measurements of appropriateness, effectiveness or efficiency of care are not possible in the hospital or
primary health care units. Most data processing at the facility level is manual, and the NHIF is not
linked by computer to hospitals. Data collection and processing is inefficient, most policy-relevant data
is lost, and little to no data analysis is undertaken. Given that district HIF offices responsible for paying
most bills are not electronically linked to the national HIF office,  information that could allow
establishment of efficiency benchmarks nationwide--and improve policy making--is not available to the
NHIF and the MOH.
13.    In short, the status quo does not allow for the achievement of stated project objectives with
respect to increasing cost-effectiveness and fiscal sustainability in the health system. With its general
benefits for financial management, the integrated medical and financial information system also lays the
essential foundation for some type of case-mix based hospital payment system that relates real economic
cost to reimbursement (such as diagnosis-related groups--DRGs). Technical study to introduce such a
system in FYR Macedonia is anticipated under the project, using data from the pilot testing of the
information system. In countries where payment systems such as DRGs have been implemented, large
savings have been achieved. In the United States, implementation in 1983 of the Prospective Payment
System (PPS) for hospital services, which is based on DRGs, produced sudden and dramatic changes in
utilization rates and Medicare hospital payments. The average annual rate of change in hospital payments
went from 18 percent in the decade before PPS was introduced (1972-83) to 7 percent during the
following decade (1983-92). The share of payments going to hospitals also dropped from 64 percent in
1983 to 54 percent in 1992, reflecting a shift to outpatient settings and greater use of preventive services.
The average length of stay in short-stay hospitals also dropped by over 15 percent in the first two years



ANNEX 3
Page 4 of 6
after PPS introduction, significantly accelerating the downward trend begun earlier. The total days of
care per 1,000 PPS enrollees dropped dramatically--over 15 percent--by the end of the first full year of
the PPS program in 1984. FYR Macedonia has a far less efficient health system than the United States,
so that movement to payment mechanisms which transfer financial risk to providers and create incentives
for efficient behavior could be expected to have equal or greater impacts on fiscal outlays and cost-
effectiveness of care.
Enhance the Technical Skills of the NHIF and Hospital Administrators
14.    The status quo was deemed unacceptable. In order to implement the other elements of this
component, such as management information systems and policy reforms, skilled technical professionals
and hospital administrators are required. If these professionals do not have the skills to understand or
take advantage of the possibilities created in the other parts of the component, the objectives of the project
will not be met. Therefore, the status quo was rejected. There are many other combinations of training
which could also succeed, but the proposed program is reasonable and cost effective. The project is
flexible enough so that training components can be altered as needs evolve.
Component II: Basic Health Services
This component has three activities: 1) reforms in the organization of health services;
2) investments in rural primary health care centers; and 3) material support for disease prevention and
health promotion programs. All three of these activities directly contribute to improving the health of
the population by enhancing the quality of basic health services
Reforms in Organization of Health Services
15.    Supply-side investments under this component are linked to reforms to reinstate an appropriate
referral system, simplify the staffing structure for primary health care, redeploy staff to rural primary
care centers, reduce excess manpower and limit the future supply of medical professionals. Additional
policy reforms certainly could be proposed. But given limited resources, the political feasibility, and
likely impact to achieve program objectives, these policy reforms were mutually selected for attention by
the Government. These reforms address the inadequacy and inefficiency of the status quo, which is
characterized by: 1) underutilization of staff in public sector facilities; 2) duplication and fragmentation
in the provision of primary care services; 3) unemployment of graduating medical professionals; 4) lack
of basic equipment and staff for primawy care in rural areas, resulting in "self referral" to hospitals and
overreliance on high-cost nospital care.
Investment in Rural Primary Health Care Centers
16.   Investments under this component complement the overall demand-side approach taken to
stimulating appropriate primary care through development of a capitation payment mechanism (see
above). Stimulation of demand for primary care--and providing patient choice--are geared toward
increasing the quality of public seclor care and generaiing competition from private sector providers.
However, global experience demonstrates that in isolated rural areas, market incentives are insufficient
for private sector development, and will not lead to socially-desirable levels of health care for rural
populations, which tend to be poorer and more elderly than the general population. Therefore, most
governments--including in countries with highly privatized health care markets, such as the United States--



ANNEX 3
Page 5 of 6
offer special incentives and/or direct public sector provision of primary care in poor, rural areas. For
this reason, a purely demand-side approach to primary care in FYR Macedonia was rejected as an
alternative to the status quo. The project includes complementary supply-side investments to ensure
provision of quality primary health care, targeted to a limited number of rural areas where public sector
intervention will remain well-justified. These investments include basic equipment for 250 rural primary
health centers (e.g., stethoscopes, infant scales, blood pressure gauges) as well as support for a permanent
program of in-service training for primary care personnel, to update prevention and treatment algorithms.
Material Support for Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Programs
17.    The alternatives to supporting disease prevention/health promotion programs which were
considered were the status quo and treatment--rather than prevention--of the associated diseases. The
status quo is characterized by less than 2 percent of health expenditures being devoted to disease
prevention programs, an amount which has declined by 35 percent in real terms since 1991. Under fiscal
pressure, FYR Macedonia's impressive history of nearly total childhood immunization coverage, has
given way to gaps in immunization coverage resulting in epidemics of infectious diseases. In 1992, for
example, measles immunization coverage fell to only 60 percent, followed by a 600 percent increase in
measles incidence in 1993-94. One-quarter of infant deaths are due to premature delivery and low birth
weight, while another quarter are due to easily preventable and treatable infectious diseases. The status
quo is clearly not contributing to project objectives to improve health status.
18.    The project team was unable to identify alternatives to supporting well-documented, cost-effective
interventions such as childhood immunization and prenatal care, as the best means to achieve
improvements in health status. The de facto alternative--treatment of the associated diseases--is clearly
less cost effective, involving, in most instances expensive drug therapy and/or hospital stays. The
programs selected, which target immunization, maternal and child health, tuberculosis prevention. AIDS
prevention, and safe blood supply are basic public health programs. It was recognized that intervention
in prevention of smoking would have been among the most cost-effective investments, but this was
deemed too controversial for an initial IDA project. Investment in female educational attainment is
another alternative which could impact on some of these areas--but is being addressed by Government
and other donors, as well as under another proposed IDA Credit (FY98).
Component III: Pharmaceutical Policy and Supply
19.    Authorization of private sector pharmaceutical activity in 1991 led to the rapid growth of private
pharmaceutical suppliers and distributors, in a largely unregulated environment. This was coupled with
continued public sector procurement of drugs for public sector health facilities and pharmacies.
Alternative project designs considered were maintaining the status quo and moving to a completely
privatized pharmaceutical market. The status quo is characterized by inefficiency in the private sector
due to well-documented market failures (monopoly/oligopoly situations, asymmetry of information,
imperfect information, etc.) associated with the pharmaceutical market, particularly a small market such
as in FYR Macedonia.  Inefficiency is also rampant in the public sector, where procurement is
fragmented and uncompetitive, and reimbursement policies encourage inappropriate prescribing and
dispensing practices. As a result, drug choice is limited (low-cost generic equivalents are unavailable)
and prices are exorbitant. For a small sample of tracer drugs (all of which were essential drugs), local
prices in the private market were 5 to 20 times higher than world market prices. Many essential drugs
are completely unavailable in rural areas. The status quo does nothing to achieve the project objective



ANNEX 3
Page 6 of 6
of making essential drugs broadly available to consumers at the lowest possible cost.
20.    The alternative of a totally private pharmaceutical market is one which no other country has
pursued. This is because an unfettered private pharmaceutical market--prone to the market failures
indicated above--would exacerbate rather than improve current inefficiencies, raising the cost for
consumers. The option of relying solely on regulation of the private sector was deemed inadequate for
the near future due to weak regulatory and enforcement capacity of the public sector. Although a well-
regulated private market could become competitive over time, it is clear that to achieve such a system
with real competition and extensive supply, would take many years. At this point in time, a weakly-
regulated private market system would lead to unnecessarily high prices, maldistribution of supply,
discrimination against the poor, inefficiency and suboptimal medical outcomes due to lack of appropriate
drug therapy. For this reason, the option of private sector regulation plus direct public sector intervention
was selected--in order to reduce barriers to market entry and create a more competitive private market
(through changes to registration, pricing and dispensing policies), as well as develop an efficient public
sector to compete directly with the private sector through supply of public sector health facilities and
pharmacies. Changes to procurement and reimbursement policies will increase efficiency in the public
sector. Indeed, a recent change to competitive bidding for local procurement has already resulted in an
average 35 percent reduction in the cost of the drugs procured by this method.
