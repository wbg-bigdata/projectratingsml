MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TC THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FORA
SECOND FORESTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Morocco for US$49 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would
be for 20 years including a 5 year grace period with interest at the standard
variable rate and would help finance a Second Forestry Development Project.
2.          Background.  Agriculture in Morocco accounts for some 17% of GDP
and employs some 40% of the labor force. Primary agricultural exports account
for some 17% of total exports; total agricultural exports, including processed
products, account for some 28% of total exports. Forests occupy 8% (5.8 M ha)
of Morocco's area and contribute an estimated 12% of agricultural value added
if one takes into account its unrecorded contribution to the kingdom's energy
and forage supply. About 85% of Morocco's domestic energy needs are met from
fuelwood, equivalent to about 10 M m3 of wood which clearly exceeds the
national forest's current sustainable yield. Forest rangelands supply more
than one-sixth of the national forage production. While directly quantifiable
economic benefits are very significant, the forest's most important
contribution to the economy is probably ecological: the protection of
watersheds and the safeguarding of water supplies, agricultural production and
wildlife, and the arresting of the erosion and desertification of Morocco's
sensitive soils. The current over-exploitation of the country's forest
resources is resulting in a steady depletion of this wealth and there is a
need for sound management programs aimed at reversing this trend.
3.          With active Bank encouragement, Morocco has been giving increasing
priority to natural resource management and forestry over the last decade or
so.  During this period, the Bank has supported forestry through four rural
development projects (Fes-Karia Tissa FY78, Loukkos FY80, Middle Atlas FY82
and Oulmes Rommani FY83). The experience from the earlier of these projects
was included in the Forestry I project (Gharb-Mamora, FY82, to be closed June
30, 1990).   All these projects included experimental or innovative improved
practices for forest plantations, exploitation, soil conservation, pest
management, etc., and institution building. Technically the implementation of
these forestry activities has been successful. However, they have (like other
projects) been suffering from Morocco's financial problems which have caused
delays in project implementation. Other major constraints on forestry
development are (a) population pressure and lack of their participation, (b)
lack of sector plans and p'.anning data, (c) inadequate funding, and (d)
difficult climatic and ecological conditions, restricting forest productivity.
4.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The project is part of the Bank's
agricultural strategy and is included among the investment priorities under
the Medium-Term Agricult ral Sector Adjustment Program defined under ASAL I
and II and in GOM's tatl at investment program (PIC) identified under the SAL.



It is also an important element in the Government's and the Bank's energy
strategy and in Morocco's 5-year plan strategy for the conservation and more
efficient utilisation of the country's natural resources. Under the forestry
components in earlier Bank projects and the Forestry I project, the Forest
Department (DEFCS) has initiated with Bank assistance a long term program for
the introduction and pilot application of new techniques and practices with
the objective of a wider application, lf successful. The proposed project is
a logical sequence to continue and expand the improvements already made,
particularly in forest regeneration and plantations, and to continue the
development of techniques and a national program for watershed management for
which support by the Bank is planned In a subsequent operation. The
institution-building process and the strengthening of DEFCS is a relatively
long-term endeavor not yet completed. For all this, Morocco needs continued
help and the Bank is uniquely placed to inject experience from neighbouring
countries and from elsewhere in the world into Morocco's forestry operations.
5.          project 0biectiven.  The objectives of the project are (a) to
support environmentally sound management and development of Morocco's forest
and other natural resources and (b) to prepare and test components for a
national watershed management program aimed at addressing soil erosion in the
country's water-catchments. The project would (a) strengthen forestry
planning and policies and (b) assist Morocco in maintaining and improving its
forestry potential to meet the country's wood and energy needs and protect its
soils and water.heds in harmony with other demands on the resources such as
domestic stock g'azing and (c) support an investment program towards these
goals.
6.          Project Deserlgtion.  To achieve the project's objectives,
priority investments have been defined from the DEFCS 5-year investment
program for inclusion in the project. The project accounts for just over half
(US$81 M) of DEFCS' capital budget for the period, and also includes
investments (US$19 M) financed by the local communities and executed by DEFCS.
The main project activities are: (a) Forestry Planning, including the
organization of a national forest inventory; the demarcation of 370,000 ha of
productive forest with unmarked boundaries; the preparation of action-oriented
forest management plans for 390,000 ha of natural forest and 300,000 ha of
forest plantations; and the preparation of a national reforestation plan. (b)
Forest ORerations consisting of regeneration of some 33,000 ha of indigenous
cork oak and cedar forest; afforestation of 31,000 ha; experimentation with
low-cost watershed management techniques involving the local populations on
10,000 ha in two water-catchments and the development of components for a
national program; the development of a total of 27,000 ha of forest ranges in
two areas where plans are available and the strengthening of a forage seed
farm; stabilisation of some 370 ha of dunes; and the construction of some 250
km of new forest roads and the rehabilitation of some 1500 km of existing
roads. (c) Supnort Activities, including the planning and equipment of two
nature conservation areas, inventories of Morocco's fauna and flora and the



-3.
establishment of a nature research and management unit; undertaking seven
silvo-pastoral development studies covering a total of nearly 100,000 ha, and
one pilot study on the argan forest area in a selected commune supporting an
ongoing Bank "women in development" sector study: measures to promote private
sector plantations; forest research, extension, training, institutional
development and technical assistance; the rehabilitation of 600 staff houses;
the purchase of 88 four-wheel drive and 10 light vehicles, 25 personal
computers and other equipment and materials. DEFCS would execute the communal
works to the same standard as those financed over their own budget.
7.          The project would disburse funds for civil works; forest
operations; equipment, tools, materials, farm 'k-uts and books; and
consultancy services, studies and training. Toial cost of the project is
estimated at US$ 100 million with a foreign exchange component of US$ 30.7
million. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
The loan amount of US$ 49M has been specifically reduced from US$ 50M by US$
1.0 because procurement procedures inconsistent with Bank Guidelines would be
used by the Government for vehicle procurement. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Morocco are given in schedules C and D, respectively.
A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, no 7752-MOR and dated
November 28, 1989, is distributed separately.
8.          Agreed Actions.  At negotiations, assurances were obtained from
the Government that it would (a) prepare modern, simple forest management
plans with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank and carry out
silvicultural treatments prescribed in these plans; prepare a national
reforestation plan by June 30, 1995; (b) before December 31, 1992, implement
measures satisfactory to the Bank, designed to promote the carrying out of
reforestation activities by La Cellulose and other private sector enterprises;
(c) [i] not later than December 31, 1992, carry out a study under terms of
reference satisfactory to the Bank, to develop a suitable structure of prices
to be charged for wood supplied by DEFCS to La Cellulose and [ii] ensure that
upon expiration of the Protocol for Pulpwood Supply in 1993, any transitional
arrangements to supply the company with pulpwood, be at prices based on the
study and agreed upon between the Government and the Bank; (d) propose an
organizational structure for DEFCS, including job descriptions for key staff,
for discussion with the Bank and implement the agreed recommendations by June
30, 1992; (e) make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank with individuals who
use forests in which regeneration under the project is to take place for
grazing purposes to ensure that the grazing activities are carried out in a
manner consistent with the regeneration activities; (f) for project activities
on non-governmental land, make suitable arrangements with the owners to ensure
proper implementation of such action; (g) employ key project staff
(sociologist, economist, technical staff) by agreed dates.



9.          Bngfts  Direct benefits of the project include Increased wood
production and foreign exchange savings, employment creation in rural areas,
where the project would be implemented, and thus increased incomes for the
rural poor, 45 of whom are still bel2w the absolute poverty level. The
project would be instrumental in promoting the participation of the local
populations in the management of their natural resources and private sector
participation. It would also contribute towards protec ig dams and
watersheds an would help meet Morocco's energy requirements, while making
more effective use of the country's natural resources and protecting its
soils. The project would have beneficial effects on the environment and
contribute towards the conservation of nature and Morocco's unique flora and
fauna. The internal economic rate of return of the project is 39X.
10.    Risks.  The two major risks facing the project are a slower than
projected growth rate for project plantations and continued government failure
to provide adequate and timely funding. The former risk is reduced by the
introduction to Morocco in recent years of vegetatively reproduced (clonal)
planting material, which has dramatically increased yields in other countries,
and the funding risk is lessened by the fact that the budget situatio. has now
improved and by ensuring that project investments are in the Government's
target investment program.  The potential risk of failure of the forest
populations to participate and comply with plans to organise livestock grazing
in project areas is reduced through the choice of project sites where there
have been successful experiences with similar works or where the populations
have asked for the project. Arrangements would also be made with concerned
populations to minimise this risk.
11.         Recommendatig . I am satisfied that the proposed project would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
