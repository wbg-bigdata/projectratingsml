 IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank's work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Bank's lending operations. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are
innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons. The operations, topics, and analytical approaches selected for assessment support larger
evaluation studies.
       A Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the Implementation Completion
Report (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department) and fieldwork conducted by IEGWB. To prepare
PPARs, IEGWB staff examine project files and other documents, interview operational staff, and in most cases
visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with staff of the Bank and the government, other stakeholders,
and beneficiaries. The PPAR thereby seeks to validate and augment the information provided in the ICR, as well
as examine issues of special interest to broader IEGWB studies.
       Each PPAR is subject to peer review and IEGWB management approval. Once cleared internally, the PPAR
is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary. The completed PPAR is then sent to
the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of
Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEGWB Rating System
       The time-tested evaluation methods used by IEGWB are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work.
The methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Following
is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional information is available on the
IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
       Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance of objectives, efficacy, and efficiency.
Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with the country's current
development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals
(expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, and
Operational Policies). Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or expected to be
achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the extent to which the project achieved, or is
expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to
alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.
       Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings: High Significant, Moderate, Negligible to
Low, Not Evaluable.
       Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory,
Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the
achievement of development objectives and sustainability. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency performance. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface

        This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Ghana
AIDS Response Project (GARFUND), financed through IDA Credit No. 3458 in the
amount of US$25.0 million (19.6 million SDR), with planned government and
community contributions of US$1.7 million and US$1.0 million, respectively. The
credit was approved on December 28, 2000, became effective on May 8, 2002, and
was 92 percent disbursed when it closed on December 31, 2005, six months after the
original closing date.

        The findings of this assessment are based on an Independent Evaluation
Group (IEG) mission to Ghana carried out in June 2006. The mission met in Accra
with authorities and staff of: the Ministry of Health, Ghana Health Service and Ghana
AIDS Commission; other public sector agencies implementing health and HIV/AIDS
activities; selected NGOs and other representatives of civil society; and bilateral and
international partners. The mission also visited the Regions (Districts/Municipalities)
of: Greater Accra (Tema), Upper West (Wa, Nadowli), Upper East (Bolgatanga,
Kassena Nankana and Navrongo), Northern (Tamale, Tolon) and Ashanti (Kumasi),
where it had the opportunity to meet with HIV/AIDS focal persons, health authorities
and other members of regional, district and municipal AIDS Committees and to
witness activities supported by GARFUND. Key sources of evidence consulted
include: (a) World Bank project files; (b) project-related reporting and evaluation;
and (c) epidemiological data, studies, surveys and research on health and HIV/AIDS,
much of it generated in Ghana.

        This PPAR is the first conducted on a World Bank-financed HIV/AIDS
project since IEG's 2005 evaluation of the World Bank's support for HIV/AIDS
control, Committing to Results: Improving the Effectiveness of HIV/AIDS Assistance,
and the first of several to be conducted on projects prepared under the Africa Multi-
Country AIDS Program (MAP). In addition, evidence from this assessment will
contribute to the evaluation of multi-sectoral approaches in achieving health
outcomes as part of IEG's forthcoming evaluation of the World Bank's support to
health, nutrition, and population. As such, relatively more material has been
presented in this "enhanced" PPAR than is the IEG standard.

        This report draws on the technical inputs of Dr. Moses Aikins, Health
Economist, JSA Consultants, of Ghana. The IEG team gratefully acknowledges all
those who made time for interviews and provided documents and information.

        Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to the
relevant government officials and agencies for their review and feedback. Their
comments are presented in Annex H.

Summary

        The objectives of the Ghana AIDS Response Project (GARFUND) were to (1)
intensify multi-sectoral activities designed to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS, and
(2) reduce its impact on those already affected by HIV/AIDS. GARFUND's design
specifically excluded the support of activities under the health sector's responsibility,
assuming that these would be adequately covered under the pooled financing of
partners (including the Bank) to the health sector, which had been ongoing since
1997. The underlying approach of the GARFUND was to provide emergency
funding to accelerate and facilitate the disbursement of funds to a broad range of
public sector and civil society actors, who would be mobilized to prepare and
implement subprojects across a range of sectors and throughout the country. The
project design envisaged the support of capacity building, monitoring and evaluation
(M&E), supervision and operational research, both to compensate for an accelerated
preparation and to support a learning-by-doing approach. Expected outcomes of
prevention efforts articulated in the project logframe included reductions in the spread
of HIV infection among the general population and among commercial sex workers
(CSW), as well as reductions in risky behavior.

        The project's support was organized around four components: (a) prevention
and care services: the financing of subprojects designed and implemented by public
agencies and civil society organizations; (b) strengthening public/private institutions
for HIV/AIDS control and care giving: the provision of training, technical assistance
and other guidance to strengthen the capacity of implementing agencies; (c)
knowledge management: the provision to implementers of best practice knowledge
and a forum for learning and exchange; and (d) project management: the creation
and support of the Ghana AIDS Commission (GAC), a multi-sectoral AIDS
coordinating entity, responsible for project management; and the support of M&E.
Until the creation of the GAC, the Ministry of Health (MoH) had been the lead
agency for HIV/AIDS.

        In 1986 the first 42 cases of AIDS in Ghana were diagnosed primarily among
CSW, who had traveled and lived abroad. By 2000 a cumulative total of 37,298
AIDS cases had been reported and the HIV prevalence rate was estimated at 3.0
percent, with highest rates in coastal Ghana. The epidemic was and remains largely
concentrated among high-risk groups. While awareness of the existence of
HIV/AIDS was almost universal by 1998, knowledge of HIV transmission and
prevention methods was lower and behaviors did not fully reflect such knowledge. In
2001 Ghana's HIV/AIDS National Strategic Framework (NSF) for 2001-2005 was
formally issued. Based on an extensive analysis of Ghana's response to the epidemic
to date, the NSF emphasized prevention (among high-risk and vulnerable groups and
among the general population), mitigation, the creation of an enabling environment,
and the establishment of a multi-sectoral institutional framework. In support of NSF
implementation, GARFUND was designed as one of the first operations under the
Africa Region's Multi-Country AIDS Program (MAP) Adaptable Program Loan.

        Reduction in the spread of HIV infections. The GARFUND was successful in
its efforts to increase rapidly and significantly the availability of financial resources to

                                            x


support Ghana's fight against HIV/AIDS. However, the efficiency of total
HIV/AIDS expenditures has not improved, with critical activities (behavior change
interventions, interventions for high-risk groups, and essential health inputs)
relatively neglected. The institutional framework set up to facilitate a multi-sectoral
approach has thus far limited the role and potential contribution of the MoH. The
under-utilization of the expertise and experience of the health sector has
compromised the technical quality of interventions and overall program effectiveness.
GARFUND support was instrumental in further decentralizing the fight against
HIV/AIDS, most notably the establishment and functioning of 10 Regional and 110
District AIDS Committees (RACs and DACs) covering all regions/districts.
However, shortfalls in the institutional framework, management processes and
capacity persist.

        GARFUND mobilized a broad range of actors and sectors for a more
expanded and expansive response. During its three-and-one-half-year
implementation, 3,030 subprojects were financed covering all districts, implemented
by a broad spectrum of public sector and civil society actors and spanning a full range
of prevention and care activities. However, there are concerns about the quality and
effectiveness of these subprojects. Prevention efforts were geared for the most part
around the transmission of basic knowledge about the disease, instead of a more
concerted effort to achieve targets to reduce risky behaviors, specified in both the
NSF and in the project design document. Most subprojects were targeted to the
general population and youth (in and out of school), with relatively few interventions
for high-risk groups that were known to be the drivers of the epidemic. Despite
nationally-set and project-specific objectives to reduce infections among commercial
sex workers, actual expenditures on this high-risk, high-transmission group were
minimal (an estimated 1 percent of GARFUND expenditures and 0.2 percent of total
HIV/AIDS expenditures). The failure to undertake essential operational research also
undermined the effectiveness of prevention interventions as well as the learning-by-
doing approach inherent in the project design. Insufficient rigor in the review of
subproject proposals and limited capacities of implementers compromised the quality,
results orientation and potential development impact of subprojects.

        While the prevalence of HIV in Ghana fell, trends in HIV prevalence are not a
valid measure for changes in the number of new infections (incidence). A decline in
HIV prevalence could conceivably be the result of high AIDS mortality or
unsuccessful treatment efforts, while an increase could signal more widespread and
successful treatment. On the other hand, positive trends in the knowledge, attitudes
and behaviors among the general population and among high-risk groups are
consistent with a reduction in HIV incidence. Unfortunately these trends are not
available because M&E was not undertaken as planned. While some baselines were
established for some groups, they were not updated at the end of the project. Field
visits suggest an increase in the knowledge of modes of HIV transmission and
prevention methods among the general population and among youth and this is likely
attributable in part to GARFUND support. However, there was no evidence of
change in the levels of fear, stigma and discrimination associated with HIV/AIDS.
Some RACs and DACs did report an increase in condom availability. Indeed, annual
condom sales increased from 24 to 30 million, between 2002 and 2005, a result
largely attributable to social marketing efforts financed by USAID. GARFUND

                                           xi


investment in condom distribution was very modest and the bulk of prevention efforts
were focused more on information, education, and communication (IEC) than on
behavior change.

        Reduction of the impact of AIDS. The availability of home- and community-
based services for the care and support of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA)
is reported by GAC and by most informants in most regions/districts to have
increased over the life of GARFUND. However, the failure to establish links
between care and support services and the formal health system, which has the
mandate for the care of AIDS patients, has left these services without the technical
support and oversight needed to ensure their quality, effectiveness and sustainability.
Some 17,500 orphans are reported to have benefited from different kinds of support
under GARFUND, but the coverage has not been systematically tracked and a
UNICEF study raises a number of issues about the quality, effectiveness and
sustainability of orphan care provided with GARFUND support.

        Ratings. While recognizing that this project was among the first to be funded
under the new, and largely untested, MAP design, this PPAR evaluates performance
against objectives and expected outcomes documented in Ghana's own national
strategy and in the project design document. On this basis, the outcome of
GARFUND is rated unsatisfactory overall, based on its modest relevance, modest
efficacy, and negligible efficiency. Risk to development outcome is rated as
substantial. The Bank's performance was unsatisfactory; and the Borrower's
performance was moderately unsatisfactory.

Lessons
· The drive to accelerate disbursements and to spread the financing across a wide
    range of implementers, activities and geographic areas poses the risk that these
    process goals could take precedence over the strategic selection and prioritization
    of the highest-impact activities.
· A more strategic choice and sustained use of implementers with the experience
    and capacity to carry out the highest-impact interventions likely would have
    resulted in stronger and more sustainable results.
· Efforts to strengthen a multi-sectoral response would likely have been more
    successful had synergies been created with the MoH, capitalizing on its technical
    and operational expertise.
· "Learning-by-doing" has the potential to improve effectiveness, but it is unlikely
    to take place in the absence of strong preparation and incentives for systematic
    monitoring and evaluation.

1. Background and Context

1.1         Ghana's population of 22.5 million is growing at 2.0 percent per annum.
More than one third of Ghanaians live below the poverty line and unemployment is
rampant, especially in urban centers. In recent years, the country has recorded good
economic performance, but past economic hardships have left Ghana with relatively
poor human development indicators. Between 1988 and 2003 health indicators have
shown overall improvement, but infant and child health indicators have deteriorated
slightly in recent years (Table 1). Annual GDP growth since 1995 has risen to over 5
percent and is likely to be sustained as current reforms are maintained within the
current government's efforts to promote growth in income and employment, improve
the delivery of services for human development and strengthen governance and
public sector management.

HIV/AIDS Epidemic

1.2         Epidemiology. In 1986, the first 42 cases of AIDS in Ghana were diagnosed.
Most initial cases occurred among women who had traveled and lived abroad,
especially commercial sex workers (CSW)1. By 2000, a cumulative total of 37,298
AIDS cases had been reported2. According to UNAIDS estimates for that same year,
some 330,000 adults and 14,000 children were HIV positive. Government of Ghana
(GoG) statistics also estimated that 119,410 children under 15 had lost their mother or
both parents to AIDS by 2000.3

1.3         As of 2000, an estimated 3 percent of women attending antenatal clinics were
HIV-positive, revealing a downward trend from an estimated 4.0 percent in 1998 and
3.2 percent in 1999.4 These updated estimates are lower than those available in 1999,
when some 4.6 percent of the adult population was estimated to be infected (1999
NACP) and HIV prevalence was noted to be increasing.5 HIV prevalence was highest
in southern Ghana (Eastern, Western, Central, Greater Accra and lower Volta regions,
3.6 percent), somewhat lower (2.6 percent) in central Ghana (Brong Ahafo, Ashanti
and higher Volta regions), and lowest (1.4 percent) in northern Ghana (Northern,


1Most of these women traveled to Côte d'Ivoire and returned to their homes in the Eastern and Greater Accra Regions. In the
earliest stages of the epidemic many Ghanaians believed that HIV/AIDS was a disease that was limited to CSW and their
customers. (Source: "AIDS in Africa During the Nineties: Ghana," 2003).
2Ghana AIDS Commission (GAC), 2001.
3Estimates included in the World Bank design documents were slightly higher, reflecting best estimates at the time: 400,000 (vs.
330,000) Ghanaians infected with HIV and 126,000 (vs. 119,410) orphans.
4 Measures Project and GAC, 2003.
5 World Bank, 2000. Some 80 percent of AIDS cases were attributed to heterosexual transmission, 15 percent to vertical
transmission, and the remaining 5 percent to transmission through blood and blood products.

                                                                 2


Upper West, and Upper East regions). However, more than three-quarters (77
percent) of sex workers who attended STD clinics in Accra were HIV-positive in
1997. More than 90 percent of AIDS cases were among persons aged 15-49 years,
with the most cases among women aged 25-29 years and men 30-34 years. In 1998
the male to female ratio was 2:1.

1.4        Knowledge and Behaviors. In 1998 97 percent of women and virtually all
men had heard about AIDS, and slightly over two-thirds of women and men knew
that a person with HIV could look healthy. At least 80 percent of men and women,
when prompted, knew that condom use protects against AIDS. Knowledge was
generally higher among urban residents and among men (GDHS, 1998). A
behavioral survey conducted in 2000 revealed that 58 percent of sex workers in
Accra, 41 percent of sex workers in Obuasi,6 57 percent of male police in Accra, and
55 percent of Obuasi miners knew the main methods of preventing HIV (FHI, 2001).
Median age at first sex increased from about 17 years in 1993 to about 18 years in
1998 for women.

1.5        While virtually all men and more than four out of five women had heard of
male condoms in 1998, knowledge of where to get condoms was far lower (66
percent of women and 77 percent of men) and only 16 percent of women and 40
percent of men had ever used one, with noted differentials between urban and rural
populations. Use of condoms among female sex workers was considerably higher,
with 95 percent of those in Accra and 75 percent of those in Obuasi reporting use of
condoms in their last paid sex act and 88 percent and 44 percent, respectively,
reporting use of condoms during every sex act with clients.


Ghana's Response

1.6        As early as 1985 a technical committee on AIDS was formed to develop a
short-term plan for AIDS prevention and control. In 1987 the National AIDS Control
Program (NACP) was established in the Disease Control Unit of the Ministry of
Health (MoH), and in the following year a medium-term plan was developed with the
World Health Organization's Global Program on AIDS (WHO/GPA). By 1994
sentinel surveillance of pregnant women attending antenatal clinics was established in
all regions of the country allowing the tracking of the epidemic.

1.7        A review of Ghana's HIV/AIDS response was undertaken in 1998-1999 by a
multi-disciplinary, multi-sectoral team under the leadership of the MoH.7 Annex C,
Box C.2, itemizes the main findings of this review. Ghana's efforts to fight
HIV/AIDS at that time consisted essentially of: promotion of safer sex (through a
strategy stressing abstinence, fidelity, and condom use), clinical responses to
prevention and care,8 inter-sectoral collaboration,9 partnerships with the non-

7Adjei et al., 2000.
8Preventing and managing STDs, preventing HIV transmission through transfusion, reducing iatrogenic transmission, reducing
mother-to-child transmission, institutional care of people living with HIV/AIDS, voluntary counseling and testing.
9Two examples include: Ministry of Education's efforts to introduce family life education into school curricula, and
collaboration between MoH and the Ghana Police in the care and education of CSW through STD clinics and outreach activities.

                                                               3


governmental sector,10 and modest expansion of district- and community-level
activities (under the District Response Initiative, DRI, pilot). Ghana's response
involved key development sectors and engaged a range of actors, including
communities, NGOs, and district-level actors. Shortfalls in that response, included:
poor targeting and coverage of prevention efforts;11 inadequate attention to behavior
change (vs. increasing awareness and knowledge); poor coverage and quality of
prevention of mother-to-child transmission and interventions to prevent transmission
by non-sterilized instruments in clinical and non-clinical settings; very limited efforts
on legal and human rights; and (with the notable exception of sentinel surveillance in
antenatal clinics), very weak monitoring and evaluation and inadequate research,
which resulted in a very limited understanding of program effectiveness. A "way
forward" was defined that sought to address these weaknesses as well as to build on
ongoing activities and experiences, especially the acceleration and expansion of the
DRI.12

1.8        The institutional framework for the HIV/AIDS response existed at both the
national and regional levels and was being piloted at the district level. At the national
level the NACP was responsible for coordinating the national response, consensus
building, policy development, technical support to other stakeholders, resource
mobilization, implementation of HIV/AIDS activities under MoH's mandate,
epidemiological surveillance, research, and monitoring and evaluation. In addition, a
technical working group, chaired by the Deputy Minister of Health provided a
platform for exchange among its members, comprised of representatives from
Ministries of Education, Social Welfare, Youth and Sports, Communications and
selected donor agencies supporting HIV/AIDS efforts. Other networks/fora for
coordination of HIV/AIDS efforts included: a UNAIDS HIV/AIDS Thematic Group;
Christian Health Association of Ghana (CHAG), coordinating all mission facilities; a
Ministry of Education (MoE) Task Force for AIDS prevention; and the Ghana
HIV/AIDS Network (GHANET), created in 1996 to coordinate the work of over 100
NGOs in an attempt to minimize duplication of efforts and waste of human and
material resources on AIDS efforts. At the regional level NACP coordinators,
responsible for program planning, oversight and coordination, were only part-time,
juggling numerous other responsibilities/disease programs, and few regional AIDS
Advisory Committees were functional. At the district level, the DRI pilot was said to
be promising, but had not yet been evaluated.

1.9        The analysis concluded that the NACP had carried out and overseen good
work, including policy formulation and planning, but its potential to fulfill its
mandate was seriously undermined by: (a) inadequate staffing at the national and



10Examples include: social marketing of condoms and NGO work with various in- and out-of-school youth.
11STD prevention and care of CSW in three clinics; limited interventions with miners, truck drivers, migrant and other mobile
groups, uniformed services (police and military).
12 The DRI was piloted in 10 administrative districts in the Ashanti Region to support a move towards a more integrated, multi-
sectoral and decentralized approach to the fight against HIV/AIDS led by the Ministry of Employment and Social Welfare
(MoESW), with full involvement of the MoH, and the support of UNAIDS and WHO. This approach involved management
capacity building and activities by communities, local NGOs and institutions.

                                                                4


regional levels;13 (b) inadequate financial support; and (c) its low position within
MoH's hierarchy, all of which were incompatible with its role to coordinate a national
response across sectors. It recommended a rigorous institutional assessment of the
institutional and organizational framework for Ghana's HIV/AIDS response.
However, in 1999, without the benefit of such an analysis, a five-day mission of the
Institutional Partnership Against AIDS in Africa14 culminated in a "joint decision
taken by Government and the International Partnership" to: establish a supra-
ministerial and multi-sectoral body to direct and coordinate the involvement of all
ministries, the private sector and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the fight
against AIDS and its impact; and strengthen the NACP and elevate it to a higher
position in MoH.

1.10       In 2001 Ghana's HIV/AIDS National Strategic Framework (NSF) for 2001-
2005 was issued, the product of a multi-disciplinary technical team of 16 experts,15
funded by UNAIDS and DFID, supported by WHO and endorsed by the Head of
State (Box 1). The evidence cited in this document points to the concentration of the
epidemic among certain groups and in certain towns and cities.16


World Bank Support for HIV/AIDS Control through 2000

1.11       Non-Lending Support. A 1989 review of Ghana's population, health and
nutrition sectors17 reported low incidence of HIV and AIDS, with 276 AIDS cases
reported as of December 1987, and documented the concentration of the epidemic in
high-risk groups. No specific strategy or action was recommended for addressing
HIV/AIDS, nor was any additional analysis of AIDS in Ghana undertaken in the
1990s. While not specific to Ghana, two widely disseminated analyses on the
HIV/AIDS epidemic were issued, in 1997 and 2000, respectively, calling for more
Government involvement in the fight against HIV/AIDS and for the prioritization of
high-impact interventions.18




13 The NACP had five full-time and four part time staff. Full time staff were the Program Manager, a Public Health Specialist,
Counseling and Laboratory Coordinators and a Senior Typist. Part-time staff included a Clinical Management Coordinator, IEC
Coordinator, a Surveillance Officer with no formal training in epidemiology and an Accountant Regional level staff were given
HIV/AIDS coordination responsibilities along with responsibilities for other disease programs and were thus not available full-
time.
14 This mission was carried out under UNAIDS leadership, with participation by the World Bank Country Director, and
representatives of other UNAIDS cosponsors (UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA, UNDCP, ILO, UNESCO, WHO) (International
Partnership against AIDS in Africa, 1999).
15 The 16 experts included representatives from: the National Population Council (NPC), MoH, the National Development
Planning Commission (NDPC), MoESW, Ghana Social Marketing Foundation (GSMF), International Federation of Women
Lawyers (FIDA), JSA Consultants, Ltd., and the Center for Development of People.
16 Seventy-six percent of commercial sex workers in Accra and 82 percent of those in Kumasi were reported to be HIV positive
and 80 percent of all HIV/AIDS infection was due to heterosexual transmission. It was also reported that a higher number of
cases occurred in the southern cities (like Kumasi, Koforidua and Accra), in mining towns (like Obuasi and Takwa) as well as in
border towns.
17 World Bank, 1989.
18 In 1997 the Bank's research department released Confronting AIDS: Public Priorities in a Global Epidemic, which made the
economic case for government involvement in fighting AIDS and provided epidemiological and economic evidence justifying
the importance of investing in public goods provision and targeting of high-risk groups (World Bank, 1997). In 1999 a new
AIDS strategy issued by the Bank's Africa Region, Intensifying Action against HIV/AIDS in Africa, pointed to the need to
strengthen government commitment and highlighted the importance of targeting high-risk groups in both low- and high-
prevalence settings (World Bank, 2000).

1.12      Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The primary goal of the Bank's strategy
for Ghana, in the 1990s through 2000 was to support Government in its efforts to
reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of its citizens through macroeconomic
stability and economic growth, higher private sector investment, capacity building
and utilization, improved quality and access to basic social services and other direct
poverty-alleviation measures (World Bank, 1995, 1997, and 2000).19 Neither the 1995
nor the 1997 have CAS addressed the HIV/AIDS epidemic.20 By contrast, the 2000
CAS emphasizes the importance of containing the epidemic through a multi-sectoral
strategy, and advocated restructuring ongoing projects in key sectors and
supplemental support to health.

1.13      Lending. At the time of project design the Bank had financed three health
sector operations, of which the first two were completed (Health and Education
Rehabilitation Project, approved in 1986; and the Second Health and Population
Project, approved in 1990) and the third was ongoing (Health Sector Support Project,
a Sector-Wide Approach [SWAp] operation, approved in 1997). This series of
investments supported improvements to service quality, coverage, efficiency and
financial sustainability. Only the third project supported the HIV/AIDS program (by


19All three CAS support Ghana's poverty alleviation and economic development goals as set out in Ghana-Vision 2020.
20The 1995 CAS mentions emerging challenges of new diseases "...such as AIDS and cardiovascular disease..."; and the 1997
CAS refers to UNAIDS as a good example of donor collaboration. But neither provides any information on the dynamics or
implications of the epidemic or programs lending or non-lending support to address it.

nature of its sector-wide approach), but support was modest21 (see Annex C, Table
C.1).


Support of Development Partners at the Time of Project Design

1.14      Before 2000 partners' support to HIV/AIDS was channeled largely through
the health sector's Programme of Work (PoW) for 1997-2001. In addition to the
World Bank credit and GoG's counterpart, pooled funding for the health sector was
also provided by DFID, DANIDA, Nordic Fund, the Netherlands, and the European
Union. HIV/AIDS activities carried out in the context of the PoW included voluntary
counseling and testing (VCT) services, prevention of mother to child transmission
(PMTCT), information, education and communication (IEC), home-based care and
social support (in collaboration with civil society organizations), improved blood
screening, training for syndromic management of STDs, tuberculosis control and
surveillance. Health sector financing also enabled the NACP to engage other
ministries and key NGOs, faith-based organizations (FBOs) and private organizations
to pilot research and other HIV/AIDS activities in selected high-prevalence areas.
Additional earmarked funds for HIV/AIDS were provided by USAID, CIDA, GTZ,
UNAIDS, UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA and WHO. (See Annex C, Table C.2.)22


2. Objectives and Design

2.1       The Ghana AIDS Response Project (GARFUND) was financed through an
IDA credit of US$25.0 million equivalent,23 approved on December 28, 2000 and
declared effective on May 8, 2002, with planned government and community
contributions of US$1.7 million and US$1.0 million, respectively.

2.2       The objective of the GARFUND was "(1) to intensify multi-sectoral activities
designed to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS, and (2) reduce its impact on those
already affected by HIV/AIDS."24 Expected outcomes of prevention efforts
articulated in the project logframe included reductions in the spread of HIV infection
among the general population and among commercial sex workers, as well as
reductions in risky behavior. Because the ongoing Health SWAp was assumed to be
providing adequate financial support to all of MoH's programs, including HIV/AIDS,
GARFUND's design specifically excluded the support of HIV/AIDS activities falling
within MoH's mandate (World Bank 2000b).

25On September 12, 2000, the Bank's Board of Executive Directors approved a US$500 million emergency Multi-Country
AIDS Program (MAP), conceived as an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) that would rapidly provide financial support to
governments in Africa seeking to mount and/or implement multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS programs. To access MAP funding each
country was required to satisfy four eligibility criteria (Box 2). Processing of individual countries' requests for financial support
under the MAP was expedited through an accelerated review process and approval by the Regional Vice-President, validated
within two weeks on the basis of the Board's non-objection (World Bank, 2000a).

the earlier MAPs) was to provide emergency funding to support and expand a multi-
sectoral approach. Through the development of fiduciary infrastructure, it sought to
increase the amount of money available to Ghana's HIV/AIDS efforts and to
accelerate and facilitate the disbursement of these funds to a broad range of public
sector and civil society actors, who would be mobilized to prepare and implement
subprojects across a range of sectors and at the community level. The project placed
strong emphasis on capacity building, considered essential to the rapid expansion of
activities. Another important feature of the GARFUND design was its strong
emphasis on monitoring and evaluation (M&E), supervision and operational research,
both to (a) compensate for an accelerated preparation phase in the interest of making
funds quickly available; and (b) to support a learning-by-doing approach. Approval
of this project was contingent on the satisfaction of MAP eligibility criteria (Box 2).

2.4      The project's support was organized around the following four components
summarized below (with estimated costs at appraisal, including contingencies). A
more detailed inventory of planned support, including a list of eligible activities for
financing, by type of implementing agency, is presented in Annex D.

2.5      Prevention and Care Services (US$21.0 million, 75% of total): This
component was designed to finance the implementation of subproject proposals
prepared by non-health public agencies and civil society entities with a view to
mobilizing a broad spectrum of preventive and care activities at national, regional and
local levels. Seventy percent of the cost of this component (US$15 million) was to be
earmarked for civil society entities, the remaining amount available for public sector
activities. Prevention activities were intended to reduce high risk behavior and
exposure to risk, and reduce vulnerabilities by raising awareness and "de-
stigmatizing" the disease with a view to improving access to prevention and care.
Care activities would reduce the vulnerability of families affected by HIV/AIDS
through financing: services to protect their rights; income generation activities; care
for orphans; and home-based care for the ill. Financing was to be provided through
three windows, each with slightly different access rules: Window A for proposals
from public sector ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) for internal and
external clients (contracts up to US$100,000); Window B for proposals from NGOs,
District Assemblies, the private sector (including private hospitals/clinics, as well as
profit-making enterprises in all sectors), trade and professional associations,
associations of PLWHAs, or groups of these entities, including affiliation networks
(umbrella organizations) (contracts up to US$25,000); and Window C for seed money
(not to exceed US$2,500) for very small community-based organizations (CBOs) and

                                            8


associations. Eligible activities, summarized in Annex D by Window, included, inter
alia: advocacy; development and dissemination of IEC; peer education; condom
distribution; counseling; training and technical assistance; care giving; social support;
research; legal advice; and support for PLWHAs. Some eligibility restrictions
applied to civil works, vehicles, overseas training, salaries of permanent staff, clinical
research and taxes.

2.6     Strengthening Public/Private Institutions for HIV/AIDS Control and Care
Giving (US$2.4 million, 9% of total): Provision of training and technical assistance
and the preparation of manuals and guidelines with a view to improving capacities in:
project proposal writing, management, monitoring and evaluation; procurement and
financial management; and building technical competencies in HIV/AIDS prevention
and care. Some capacity building activities were to be conceived by the GAC
Secretariat, while others were expected to be included in subproject proposals. The
training was to be subcontracted to NGOs and line ministries with requisite
experience and expertise.

2.7     Knowledge Management (US$1.4 million, 5% of total): This component was
designed to set up and maintain an information clearing house and database on
HIV/AIDS that would help implementing agencies improve their effectiveness.
Implementers were to be provided with the latest information on HIV/AIDS
prevention and care, best practice examples from other countries, research results, and
any other reports that would be useful to them. Information sharing and
dissemination would be supported through: fora for exchange among implementing
entities, newsletters, published papers and research, and the internet. It was expected
that umbrella organizations would have a key role in information dissemination.
Regional AIDS Committees (RACs) were also expected to serve as focal points for
dissemination, once established.

2.8     Project Management (US$3.0 million, 11% of total): This component was
designed to support a new institution for National HIV/AIDS Program coordination,
the Ghana AIDS Commission (GAC), which would be chaired by the Head of State,
comprised of high-level representatives of key ministries, the private sector and civil
society, and supported by a GAC Secretariat. Establishment of the GAC Secretariat
and decentralized branches of the GAC (regional AIDS Committees - RACs, and
district AIDS Committees ­ DAC) was also envisaged.

2.9     A strong monitoring and evaluation subcomponent was intended to assess the
progress attained in the fight against AIDS nationwide on the basis of targets defined
in the Strategic Framework and to monitor GARFUND implementation. It envisaged
the collection and analysis of trend data through ongoing surveillance of prevalence
among pregnant women attending ANC clinics, population-based studies on
knowledge, attitudes, practices and behavior (on both the general population and on
high-risk groups), and a DHS survey. It also envisaged the involvement of civil
society in monitoring and ensuring accountability at the grassroots level. However,
no specific budget allocation was assigned to this subcomponent.

2.10    Implementation Arrangements. GARFUND was established essentially as
a fund to finance subprojects executed by a wide range of organizations at the

                                                                 9


national, regional and local levels. GARFUND was to be placed under the overall
authority of the GAC, which would: define broad priorities for action, oversee the
selection of subproject proposals and monitor project performance. The GAC
Secretariat was given direct responsibility for GARFUND oversight and
management. It was supposed to solicit and vet subproject proposals, ensuring that
proposed activities correspond to GARFUND's menu of activities eligible for
funding. A Project Review and Appraisal Committee (PRAC), appointed by GAC,
was to meet twice a year to select eligible subproject proposals, vetted by the
Secretariat.26 Once approved subproposals would be endorsed by the GAC, the
Secretariat would process and finance the contracts. To access funds, line ministries
would be asked to submit proposals based on previously prepared HIV/AIDS action
plans and to define a line item for HIV/AIDS in their respective budgets in order to
contribute their own matching funds (10 percent of the cost of activities). To ensure
that local needs were addressed and duplication was minimized, all implementing
entities (NGOs, FBOs, CBOs) would be asked to obtain the endorsement of the
districts where they proposed to work. While public sector, NGO, FBO, district and
other proposals were to be reviewed and approved centrally, the review and approval
of CBO proposals was to be carried out at the district level,27 based on district
allocations fixed by the GAC secretariat. Annex E, Table E.1 presents institutional
and technical eligibility criteria for the selection of subprojects for funding, by type of
implementing agency.

2.11        All subprojects were required to be completed within one year and the
implementing agency was required to submit: (a) interim reports, on which basis
subsequent tranches of financing under the contracts would be released; and (b) a
project completion report, containing technical and financial details of the subproject
with the supporting documents including final bank statements. Project completion
reports would need to be endorsed as satisfactorily completed before future funding
for new proposals submitted by those implementing agencies would be considered.28
Random ex-post technical audits/assessments were to be subcontracted out by the
Secretariat to verify activities completed.

2.12        The GAC Secretariat was also given responsibility for the financial and
administrative aspects of GARFUND, capacity building of implementing agencies,
assurance of compliance with Bank procedures, preparation and administration of
contracts with executing entities, monitoring their technical and financial
performance, preparation of financial and technical reports, and commissioning of
annual audits, all in compliance with the GARFUND operational manual. Project
financing of the GAC Secretariat covered the costs of doing business and salaries of
all staff.

26In its review of subproject proposals, the PRAC, was to apply the following criteria ensuring that: the project would benefit
the target group; proposed activities are feasible; costs would be reasonable; current priorities, as determined by the GAC, would
be addressed; in-kind contributions would be incremental to the subproject; and participatory approaches would be used for
subproject design (GAC, 2004b).
27The DAC, under the leadership of the M&E Focal Person, was responsible for evaluating, approving and selecting CBO
subproject proposals. Contracts would be signed by the District Chief Executive and a copy would be sent to GAC for funding.
28While there was no explicit policy in the operations manual to prohibit the award of subsequent contracts to NGOs and CBOs,
upon satisfactory completion of a subproject, two factors might have made discouraged follow-on contracts. First was the
unwritten policy of the project to mobilize as many NGOs and CBOs as possible (interviews w/ Bank team members and w/
GAC staff). Second was the reference in the design of the document to CBO support as "seed money" (World Bank, 2000b)
implying a one-time investment to stimulate action.

3. Implementation and Costs
3.1        The 16-month delay between project approval and effectiveness was due in
part to the Presidential elections of December 2000 and in part to the need to establish
the GAC before launching activities. The project was implemented over a period of
just over three and one half years, closing on December 31, 2005, six months after the
original closing date.

Planned versus Actual Costs and Financing

3.2        The total project cost was US$26.6 million or 96 percent of the cost estimated
at appraisal (Table 2). While the allocation for the Prevention and Care Services
component was fully utilized, about two-thirds of the allocations of the remaining
three components were utilized. Of the original IDA credit amount of 19.6 SDR, 92
percent was disbursed and the remaining amount was cancelled.29 Counterpart
funding provided by government amounted to US$1.6 million versus the planned
amount of US$1.8 million. Because of fluctuations in the exchange rate, actual
counterpart funding in terms of cedis, is estimated to have been 118 percent of initial
commitments. However, delays in counterpart financing and inadequate budgeting of
contributions by the line ministries were both issues during implementation.30 Data
on actual community counterpart financing was not available. IDA financing through
GARFUND is estimated to be about 30 percent of total financing for HIV/AIDS in
Ghana, based on HIV/AIDS National Accounts data available for 2003, the first full
year of GARFUND implementation.31

3.3        Prevention and Care. A total of 3,03033 subprojects were approved and
funded under GARFUND through a series of four calls for subproject proposals
(Table 3). Of the total subprojects funded, 2,777 (92 percent) were completed.34 All
CBO subprojects were completed, while completion rates for the remaining
implementing agencies averaged 70 percent. The 253 projects reported as not having

at US$25.71 million, and cancelled amount at US$2.24 million, against the original equivalent value of US$25.0 million when
the credit was approved (Source: World Bank Loan Department database).
30 Public agency counterpart contributions were reduced from 10 to 5 percent of work plan costs, but difficulties in meeting
obligations persisted throughout the project.

3.4        Distributions of subprojects and of total subproject disbursements across the
different types of implementing agencies show that CBOs implemented the majority
(72 percent) of approved subprojects, followed by NGOs, FBOs and DAs (25
percent), MDAs (2 percent) and the private sector (1 percent). On the other hand,
NGOs, FBOs and DAs, together, received the bulk (65 percent) of subproject
financing, followed by CBOs (21 percent), MDAs (12 percent) and the private sector
(2 percent). Subprojects financed under the GARFUND covered all ten regions of
Ghana, with the highest HIV prevalence regions (Ashanti, Brong Ahafo, Eastern,
Greater Accra and Volta) having the largest number of subprojects and the greatest
shares of subproject financing (Annex E, Figure E.2). This is in part an outcome of
the decision to prioritize these regions in the first call, but is also likely to be a
function of their closer location to Accra, their previous experience in HIV/AIDS
activities, stronger civil society capacity and greater access to support and
information.

3.5        The average size of subproject contracts varied according to the type of
implementer: US$34,000 for MDAs, US$20,000 for NGOs/FBOs, US$27,000 for
associations of PLWHA, US$2,000 for CBOs, and US$19,000 for the private sector
(Annex E, Table E2).36

3.6        Throughout implementation GARFUND sought to finance new, different
NGOs and CBOs for every new round of proposals, as a means to incite activities in
as many parts of the country and to spread the financing to as many beneficiaries as
possible. There are no policies or guidelines in the GARFUND operational manual
requiring or recommending this practice. Nevertheless it was documented by GAC
and UNAIDS (GAC, 2004) and raised in numerous in-country interviews. Bank staff
supervising GARFUND confirmed that, while not necessarily explicit, GAC's policy
was "to mobilize as many NGOs and CBOs as possible." Reviews of subproject




35GAC did not receive completion reports on all subprojects that were fully disbursed. For example, a tally of 501 NGO/FBO
subprojects shows that all of these subprojects were fully disbursed, but that only 287 (or 57 percent) had filed completion
reports to GAC.
36The private sector was slow to submit subproject proposals to GARFUND, and it was only under the fourth call for proposals
(April 2004) that private sector subproject proposals were approved and implemented with GARFUND support.

                                                               12


contract tallies corroborate this information, revealing very little incidence of
"repeater contracts."37

3.7          Strengthening Public/Private Institutions for HIV/AIDS Control and Care
Giving. Considerable amounts of training and workshops were financed under this
component aimed at building the capacity of public sector and civil society
implementers. At the national level five different training courses were carried out,
each of which benefited trainees in all 10 regions. This training focused on skills
development in proposal writing, financial management, procurement, project
implementation, M&E, and "HIV/AIDS competency" (not defined). This training
was delivered to a total of 1,337 trainees38 representing a range of stakeholders (DAs,
RCCs, NGOs, CBOs, and MDAs). Regional and district level training benefited some
19,510 trainees,39 81 percent of, which received training in "HIV/AIDS competency,"
the remaining 19 percent distributed more or less equally across the remaining
topics.40 Training was not evaluated for its impact. Capacity building activities were
included in a significant proportion of subproject contracts: 60 percent of MDAs, 41
percent of NGOs/FBOs, and 41 percent of private enterprises. GHANET did receive
support to carry out subproject activities, but only a small proportion of funds
received were allocated for capacity building. GARFUND's practice of financing
new, different NGOs/CBOs for every round of proposals undermined the
effectiveness and sustainability of capacity building efforts.

3.8          Knowledge Management activities supported and disseminated several
research studies.41 The Bank's team and the GAC Secretariat report that materials and
best practices were disseminated to decentralized implementers in the regions and
districts. However, (a) IEG could not find evidence to document to what extent and
on what basis best practices were determined and how effectively and often they were
disseminated42; (b) field interviews reveal a strong, unmet demand for technical
advice, guidance and support, information on good practices, and financial and
technical assistance for the support of relevant operational research43; and (c) GAC
was unable to respond to IEG's request for a tally of all research financed under
GARFUND itemizing the topic, research results and whether or how results were
used to improve effectiveness.

3.9          Project Management. The GAC was formally established in January 200244
to direct and coordinate the involvement of all ministries, the private sector and
NGOs in the fight against HIV/AIDS in Ghana. As the highest policy-making body
on HIV/AIDS, its mission is to provide leadership in the coordination of all programs

37GAC Secretariat staff have since confirmed that only four of the 3,030 subprojects were repeater projects (communication to
IEG of January 2007). However, in its official comments (Annex H-1) the Borrower states that this information is incorrect, but
provides no additional data.
38It is possible that this total includes some double-counting due to the likelihood of the same individual attending more than
one training session.

and activities of all stakeholders (public, private and civil society) in the fight against
HIV/AIDS through advocacy, joint planning, monitoring and evaluation. The
President and Vice-President of Ghana serve, respectively, as Chairman and Vice-
Chairman of the GAC, whose membership includes high-level representation of some
15 ministries, including MoH, and representatives of a wide array of civil society
organizations.

3.10      By the same act of Parliament the GAC Secretariat was also established as the
executive arm of the GAC to provide it with technical and administrative support.
Headed by a Director-General, the Secretariat is made up of four Divisions: Finance;
Administration; Policy, Planning, Research, Monitoring and Evaluation; and
Technical Services. Although recruitment of these key positions was launched in
2001, most of these positions, including that of the Director-General, were not
effectively filled until 2002, a key reason for delayed effectiveness. One crucial
position, Director of Technical Services, was never filled.

3.11      The GAC met regularly three times a year to review progress towards the
implementation of Ghana's Strategic Framework. The GAC PRAC (whose
membership was made public and rotated once every two years) met twice annually
to review and recommend to the GAC financing of subproject proposals. However,
the planned mapping of high priority target groups was not implemented, making it
impossible to track coverage of these groups with specific interventions.

3.12      Legal Covenants. The Borrower complied with all seven covenants related
to financial management, audits and project reporting.

3.13      Procurement. Goods and services purchased by the GAC Secretariat were
procured in accordance with procedures stipulated in the legal agreement.
Procurement by implementing agencies, in the form of local purchases, was subject to
post reviews, but review of documentation and field visits revealed little evidence of
sufficiently frequent or systematic post reviews, or of corrective action taken. An
audit highlighted the issue of lack of adherence by CBOs to procurement guidelines
requiring three quotations for local purchases.45 Another audit report noted that
because of the practice (for each new round of proposals) of favoring new NGOs and
CBOs over those who had previously benefited from GARFUND support,
procurement procedures may not have been appropriate.46 The mid-term review did
not undertake a primary analysis of procurement. A 2003 post review was cited and
simplification of procedures was underway. It did not cite cases of non-compliance
of procurement procedures or recommend ways to improve capacity and practice.
IEG review of documents and field visits revealed many incidences of items
purchased under NGO and CBO contracts that were not always in sync with
subproject activities or duration.

3.14      Financial Management. External audits and periodic supervision by GAC
Secretariat and Bank supervision missions confirmed that financial management and
accounting standards required by IDA were respected overall. Nevertheless, an audit
of a sample of 75 CBOs financed under Window C revealed that many failed to
prepare bank reconciliation statements and register or maintain a register for fixed

                                                                  14


assets funded under the project.47 This audit also revealed that CBOs made changes in
signatories to bank accounts without GAC prior approval, many lacked supporting
documents for items purchased or expenditures incurred, some NGO proposals were
funded without a budget, many ineligible items were purchased, and the required
beneficiary's contribution (10 percent) was not always documented. There were
cases of duplication of payments and of relatively large sums transferred from
subproject account to CBO accounts, as large as 20 percent of the contract amount.
Some entities modified funding for specific activity without GAC approval. The use
of third party receipts for payments was detected by auditors, but never followed up.
Audit reports also cited instances of use of project money for meals, accommodation
and purchase of computers, printers and office equipment that seemed inappropriate
or excessive considering the nature and duration of project activities. Expenditures
that were inappropriate or unaccounted for were corroborated by IEG's field visits, its
own examination of project documentation and random inquiries with beneficiaries.
Project funds to parliamentarians and traditional chiefs for HIV/AIDS campaigns
(under Window B) were not fully accounted for at the time of the IEG mission.48
Random checks of subproject proposals by IEG corroborated incidences of
unnecessary hardware purchases for short-term outreach activities. Inadequate
screening and lack of accountability of NGOs/CBOs were also corroborated by
interviews, field visits and documentation reviewed.49 Lack of information at central,
regional, district and local levels on what other partners were funding led to
duplication of financing and efforts. Implementation arrangements gave the RACs
and DACs no authority to examine accounts of NGOs/FBOs and audit reports were
never shared with these decentralized authorities.

3.15          The GAC Secretariat's efforts to monitor the use of funds for intended
purposes and for the accountability of said funds did prompt it to carry out activities
to obtain reimbursement from civil society organizations that were not to be using
funds properly. Annex E, Table E.3 itemizes the results of these efforts, but notes
that they were limited in scope (focused primarily on the 20 percent of projects
audited/reviewed) and that for funds now accounted (especially funds used by
Parliamentarians) supporting documents were not available for validation.50

3.16          Disbursements. The release of follow-on tranches to NGOs and CBOs under
ongoing contracts was widely noted to be very slow, threatening timely project
execution, continuity and completion, and, as a consequence, the credibility of
implementing agencies. Delays were due to: the learning curve of GAC Secretariat
and recipient NGOs/CBOs; absence of officials designated to sign payment vouchers;
lack of familiarity of CBOs with banking procedures; and inadequate skills to prepare

47 Ernst and Young, 2003.
48 At the time of IEG's mission, six months after project closing (a) only 43 of the 158 members of Parliament who had received
funds for HIV/AIDS campaigns had submitted a report to GAC. After IEG's mission an additional 65 submitted reports (see
also Annex E, Table E.4); and (b) a traditional council contacted by IEG received 20 million cedis (US$2,200), a first tranche of
a 100 million cedis contract, but only spent 3.5 million on a workshop to launch its activities. It reported that it was assessing
how it would use the remaining 16.5 million.
49For one example, a meeting with a RAC, including representatives from NGOs and CBOs, noted that NGOs/CBOs have
mushroomed since GARFUND has made so much financing available. IEG was told that it is very easy for two to three persons
to write a proposal and access GARFUND money, and then disappear. GAC meeting minutes also document this concern. The
Operations Manual specifies that in order to be eligible for financing NGOs must be registered, whereas eligibility criteria for
CBOs are much more lax. IEG could not determine to what extent (a) the NGO criteria under the selection process were adhered
to; (b) it is relatively quick and easy for NGOs to officially register; and/or (c) this issue was limited to CBO subprojects.
50 While in the field IEG was unsuccessful in obtaining sample reports from Parliamentarians to understand how funds were
used, what activities were carried out and what results were achieved.

                                            15


and submit statements of expenditures, on which basis a subsequent tranche would be
released.

3.17      Mid-Term Review (MTR). The MTR took place in March 2004, at which
time over 2,700 NGOs, FBOs, CBOs and MDAs had received GARFUND support.
It concluded that progress in project implementation and in the achievement of
development objectives was satisfactory and that project management was "best
practice." Recommendations for improved performance and effectiveness included:
shifting emphasis away from general IEC towards more targeted interventions aimed
at specific groups (CSWs, homosexuals, youth, PLWHA associations, miners and
transport) and toward high-prevalence areas. Efforts were also recommended to step
up weak and late-start areas of project performance, particularly MDAs, private
sector activities, and activities under the Knowledge Management and Strengthening
of Public and Private Institutions components. The MTR also recommended working
closely with the NACP/MoH for the sake of project efficiency and the analysis and
use of available data on HIV prevalence and behaviors.


4. Monitoring and Evaluation

Design

4.1       Program Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E).51 Strengthening research,
monitoring and evaluation was accorded high priority by GoG, designated as one of
the five key intervention areas of the 2001-05 NSF (Box 1). A National M&E Plan
for the NSF was developed by GAC, with the technical assistance and support of
USAID, DFID and other development partners. At the central level, the GAC would
coordinate and monitor the activities of national level MDAs, NGOs, and RACs. A
Directorate of Policy, Planning, Research, Monitoring and Evaluation was to be
staffed by a Director, a Research Coordinator, an Information Officer and an M&E
Coordinator. In addition, the Research, Monitoring and Evaluation Technical
Committee of the GAC was given responsibility for creating a national set of core
indicators for M&E of the national response. At the regional level, RACs were
charged with monitoring community HIV/AIDS activities within their respective
regions. A Regional M&E Focal Person would be responsible for preparing and
implementing a regional M&E plan which would coordinate and track the activities
of the DAC's. At the district level, DACs through the District M&E Focal Person
were responsible for: (a) monitoring AIDS Programs implementation (tracking inputs,
outputs, activities); and (b) providing data relevant for national level M&E, such as
the tracking of trends in behavior change. At the implementation level, agencies
would report on indicators to monitor the various activities of their respective
programs.

4.2       Prevention indicators included HIV prevalence among women attending ANC
(sentinel surveillance); HIV prevalence among female CSW in Kumasi; HIV
prevalence of infants born to HIV infected mothers; behaviors and knowledge of
young people (15-24 years); the delivery of HIV/AIDS education in schools; quality

                                                              16


of STI services; percent of blood supply adequately screened; availability and
utilization of services to mother-to-child transmission; and availability and
affordability of VCT services. However, program indicators failed to capture and
monitor progress in the knowledge and behaviors of high-transmission, vulnerable
and other groups specified in the NSF. Indicators were also chosen to measure
process and outputs on the other four components of the NSF: care and support;
creation of an enabling environment; decentralized implementation; and program
research, monitoring and evaluation.

4.3       GARFUND M&E. The project logframe included indicators and targets
commensurate, for the most part, with those established for the national program,
grouped around the two main objectives of reducing new infections (HIV prevalence,
knowledge and behaviors) and mitigating the impact of the affected and infected
(provision of specialized services).52 However, the logframe did not clearly articulate
a results chain, which linked inputs, outputs, outcomes, and impacts. Some indicators
were not appropriate (e.g., trends in HIV prevalence as a measure of reducing new
infections), while others that would have measured the program's intent to target
high-transmission and high-risk groups, in line with comparative advantages of the
various actors, were missing. Notwithstanding these omissions, GARFUND did plan
to map high-risk groups and monitor coverage of these groups and to use the data
collected to set funding priorities for the subsequent funding cycle. There was no
plan to assess the outcomes of public sector and civil society activities, however, even
on a random basis.53

4.4       Trends in knowledge, attitudes, practices and behaviors were to be
documented through: (a) the 1998 GDHS, with a follow-on GDHS planned for 2003
or 2004; and (b) a 2000 survey on knowledge, attitudes and behaviors for high-risk
groups (youth, CSW, miners and police), with a similar end-of-project survey. Roles
and responsibilities for M&E were not clearly articulated in the project design
document, but the Borrower has confirmed that the new framework for M&E
described in the national M&E plan was relied upon (Annex H-1). Interviews, field
observations, and reviews of Bank and Borrower reports on project progress all
provide evidence that incentives to disburse funds were stronger than incentives to
measure results.

Implementation

4.5       In May 2005 a national progress report on the implementation of the M&E
plan noted that data was not being routinely and systematically reported to GAC; it
called for the preparation of guidelines for the timely reporting of essential data for
GAC.54 It was also recognized that capacity building and the provision of feedback
for those collecting and analyzing data at the lower levels were critical to improving
program M&E as was the need to review and revise reporting formats for improved
consistency and accuracy. This review did not specifically note any gaps in
indicators on targeted interventions for high-risk groups, only noting that indicators


52Annex G itemizes indicators, and baselines (where available) for GARFUND, by objective. The GARFUND logframe also
included numerous process indicators (numbers of subprojects, implementers, districts supported) which are also reported on in
Annex G.

could be reviewed and revised only at the time of preparation of the M&E plan for
2006-2011 to ensure consistency in data collection and reporting. Development
partners noted that throughout the life of GARFUND, GAC's M&E plan for the NSF
was not operational and their dialogue with GAC to strengthen and operationalize it
became a source of tension.

4.6        The GARFUND logframe and impact/outcome indicators were not revised
during implementation.55 Baselines were never established for some indicators; other
indicators were not adequately tracked. The timing of the two GDHSs was not ideal:
the first GDHS was too early to serve as a baseline (1998) and the second one took
place only one year after project effectiveness (2003, Table 4). The 2000 FHI-
sponsored survey on behaviors of key target groups was a useful baseline, but was
never followed up by an end-of-project (or end-of program) survey. There was no
end-of-project data for the majority of indicators (Annex G). A Ghana Multiple
Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) was carried out in 2006, which collected some data
on knowledge and behavior. However, because of the very recent availability of these
data and their preliminary nature, IEG was unable to use them to assess trends. It was
thus not possible to assess trends over time. GARFUND's reporting requirements
strongly favored the tracking of financial flows and execution rates over results
reporting, which did not facilitate the MAP's policy of "learning by doing." A
mapping exercise of subprojects was carried out, which documented the geographic
coverage of subprojects with a view to extending coverage to all geographic areas.
IEC could find no evidence of a strategic assessment of the coverage of specific
groups with specific interventions in response to epidemiological and behavioral
evidence.

4.7        While the institutional and organizational framework and staffing for M&E
envisaged under Ghana's national M&E plan were clear, implementing agencies did
not have the proper training or tools for setting targets and measuring their
outcomes.56 The job descriptions for regional and district M&E focal persons
demanded the skills of highly qualified, full-time professionals. In contrast, district
and regional M&E focal persons were civil servants with full-time responsibilities to
their sectors, fulfilling HIV/AIDS M&E responsibilities on their own time. Training,
technical supervision and support, and tools were inadequate. RAC and DAC
attempts to monitor and evaluate activities were undermined by the fact that NGOs
were approved by, financed by, and reported directly to, GAC and did not consider
themselves accountable to regional/district AIDS Committees or focal persons. Time,

55At the time of the MTR it was decided to keep the original impact and outcome indicators. Nevertheless, a few process
indicators were added to the mix to facilitate assessment of implementation progress: share of line ministries, districts and
communities that have prepared HIV/AIDS work programs; number of associations of PLWHA that are participating in the
project; lag between submission and approval of plans by level; lag between approval of plans and disbursement by level;
percentage of districts/communities that have mapped high transmission areas.
56 The Borrower in its comments (Annex H-1) cites a number of M&E capacity building activities that were financed by
sources other than GARFUND, but the fact remains that M&E capacity remained weak.

                                                              18


skills and resource constraints limited the work of M&E focal persons largely to the
consolidation of subproject reports (with or without field visits) and dispatching them
to GAC, without analysis, validation, or (for the most part) local use.

Utilization of Data for Decision-Making

4.8         Information on key prevention and care indicators57 was not collected and thus
could not be used for decision-making. More fundamentally, the incentives to collect
and analyze data to improve program/project impact were weak. Rather, incentives to
expand the fight against HIV/AIDS (in terms of number and range of implementers
and level of disbursements) were very strong. IEG's review of reports in the regions
and districts visited revealed that M&E activities were considered a requirement by
GAC/GARFUND, rather than a management or accountability tool. While M&E
reporting requirements were not considered interesting or relevant to M&E focal
persons, they did express a strong demand for operational research. There was an
overwhelming opinion among those interviewed in the field that research in key areas
would have provided local managers and implementers with information that would
enable sound strategic decision-making for enhancing performance. On the other
hand, an assessment of orphan support (para. 5.21) does not seem to have been used
to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of efforts in this regard.


5. Outputs and Outcomes by Objective

5.1         In assessing attribution of outcomes to GARFUND, it is important to note that
GARFUND (a) represented about 30 percent of all public and private HIV/AIDS
financing in 2003 (its first full year of implementation),58 (b) excluded the support of
HIV/AIDS activities carried out by MoH;59 and (c) supported non-health
implementing agencies (public and private) that were also receiving financial support
from other partners in development. There is incomplete information on the full costs
and financing of the GoG's fight against HIV/AIDS by programmatic activity, by
geographical region, by implementing agency/recipient of financing, and by
financier.60 However, during GARFUND implementation (2002-2005) an estimated
US$10.6 million in external assistance was earmarked for HIV/AIDS activities
carried out under MoH,61 and an additional US$91.3 million in external assistance
was channeled directly to key sectors (such as Education), NGOs, CBOs and other
local-level agencies).62 Many civil society organizations interviewed stated that, in


57 For example, knowledge, behaviors, access to and utilization of care and support services.
58 UNAIDS and GAC, National HIV/AIDS Accounts, 2002-2003 (Annex F, Table F.5).
59 Activities to reduce HIV transmission (promotion, provision and expansion of VCT and PMTCT services); improvements to
the quality and coverage of care and services for PLWHA (ART and treatment of OIs, STI treatment, lab services, support to
PLWHA associations for income generation and other activities); epidemiological surveillance; and production/dissemination of
information and guidelines on prevention and care.
60 The National HIV/AIDS Accounts (2002-2003) present of total expenditure by program intervention and by type of financier,
but expenditures by individual financier, implementing agency, and region/district are not itemized.
61 Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), UNAIDS, EU and Danish Embassy earmarked these funds, over
and above allocations to the NACP within the health budget including basket funding provided by selected donors (on which
specific data could not be obtained) (Annex F, Table F.5 ). The following year an additional US$14.9 million IDA grant was
approved for Ghana under the US$60 million Regional HIV/AIDS Treatment Acceleration Project (TAP), managed by MoH, to
improve quality of life and quality of care of PLWHA; prevent mother-to-child transmission and decrease the risk of sexual
transmission; and diminish the stigma of HIV/AIDS.

addition to GARFUND, they were receiving financial support from other sources, but
were not able to present an overview of costs and financing of their activities. Annex
G presents a matrix summarizing this evaluation's attempt to show program and
project outcomes against targets and indicators by project objective and subobjective.
For reasons noted in Chapter 4, this was a difficult undertaking, which has produced
an incomplete patchwork of data that must be interpreted cautiously.

Reduce the spread of HIV infection

5.2       The GARFUND rapidly increased the availability of financial resources to
support Ghana's fight against HIV/AIDS. Between 2002 (the year of GARFUND
start-up) and 2003 (its first full year implementation), total annual expenditures on
HIV/AIDS in Ghana more than doubled, rising from 108 billion cedis (US$13.5
million) to 237 billion cedis (US$28.1 million).63 Forty-eight percent of the increase
was attributable to GARFUND, and 47 percent was attributable to other foreign
assistance, especially GFATM's first disbursement to Ghana in 2003 (Annex F Table
F.5). These expenditure levels are likely underestimates, as they do not fully capture
out-of-pocket expenditures for traditional medicine or the considerable non-monetary
transactions and contributions of families and communities.

5.3       However, the efficiency of overall HIV/AIDS expenditures has not
improved. While the mobilization of financial resources for non-health activities
was the intention of GARFUND, health sector investments essential to the
achievement of adequate coverage and quality of HIV/AIDS-related services (health
personnel, reagents, consumables, condoms, drugs, etc.) are noted by GAC and
UNAIDS to be underfinanced. National HIV/AIDS Accounts analysis for 2002-2003
show that expenditures on health activities increased only marginally, relative to
overall increases, while non-health expenditures increased almost eightfold (Figure
1). In addition, expenditure (all financing sources included) on high-transmission
groups and other target groups, specified in the NSF and in GARFUND design
documents as high-priority, is extremely low at barely 1 percent of total expenditures
for 2003 (Annex F, Table F.6), and low coverage of target groups persisted
throughout implementation. Expenditure on CSW, which is known to be highly
effective and efficient in averting new infections, was only 0.2 percent of all
expenditure in 2003, or 1 percent of total GARFUND expenditure for that year,
despite nationally-set and project-specific targets to reduce infections among this
group.

5.4        GARFUND has mobilized a broad range of actors and sectors for a more
expanded and expansive response and supported a wide array of HIV/AIDS
interventions. The financing of subprojects in the public sector engaged and
supported numerous actors in the preparation and implementation of work place
policies, including key sector ministries,64 research institutions, Regional
Coordinating Councils, District Assemblies, Parliamentarians, traditional councils
and chiefs, and other public sector agencies.65 Through its financing of civil society
subprojects, hundreds of NGOs/FBOs and thousands of CBOs were mobilized into
action in all of Ghana's districts. Thirteen PLWHA associations in six regions were
provided with technical and financial support with a view to increasing and enhancing
their involvement. Within the private sector 11 health-related facilities and nine
private enterprises were brought into the fight. Figures 2 and 3 provide an overview
of the types of interventions supported under subprojects designed and implemented
by public sector agencies and NGOs/FBOs, respectively. Public sector interventions
supported the establishment of workplace interventions and interventions aimed at the
clients of these agencies. CBO subprojects were too numerous to analyze in detail,
but a quick review of tallies indicates that the vast majority focused their efforts on
peer education, advocacy, awareness creation, with far fewer subprojects focusing on
care and support. Private health facilities concentrated their efforts on VCT, care and
support, capacity building and IEC, while private enterprises supported workplace
policies and interventions, focusing primarily on IEC and, to a lesser extent, peer
education, advocacy and capacity building (Annex E, Figure E.3). The exact nature

Council, the National Commission on Culture, regional branches of the National Disaster Management Organization (NADMO),
Customs, Excise and Preventive Services and the Social Security and National Insurance Trust.

5.5      GARFUND has contributed to national capacity building efforts for
HIV/AIDS in Ghana. It supported the establishment and operations of the GAC and
its Secretariat and provided technical and financial support to the review and
refinement of the national strategy with other partners. GARFUND has also
supported the decentralization of the fight against HIV/AIDS. Regional and District
AIDS Committees (RACs and DACs) are now operating in Ghana's 10 regions and
110 districts and have benefited, along with civil society actors in every region, from
management and technical training. Guidelines for subproject proposal preparation,
review and implementation also supported capacity building of local actors.
Nevertheless, the institutional framework for HIV/AIDS remained rather centralized
in its functions and understaffed at the decentralized levels and roles and
responsibilities between the central, regional and district levels were reported by
many informants to be unclear and not fully reconciled with the DRI being piloted at
the time of project design.

5.6      Prevention subprojects financed by GARFUND were geared for the most
part around the transmission of basic knowledge about the disease through IEC
and peer education, instead of a more concerted effort to address and change

                                                                    22


specific behaviors. Inclusion by most subprojects of advocacy, peer education, IEC,
sensitization is likely to have contributed (along with other GARFUND-financed
efforts66) to improved knowledge of the main modes of transmission and prevention
methods. Subprojects with condom promotion and distribution were small in scale
and irregular, and thus not likely to have contributed substantially to ensuring
sustainable access or use of condoms in the regions and districts. Regional and
district focal persons did not have specific information on the total numbers and
destinations of condoms distributed in their respective catchment areas under the
2001-05 NSF, or on GARFUND's particular contributions to this end.

5.7         Most subprojects were targeted to the general population and youth (in and
out of school), with relatively few instances of interventions for specific high-risk
groups that would be expected to have the largest impact on new infections
(subproject documentation and field interviews). Interventions for high-risk groups
are very modest in terms of (a) the level of effort of the ongoing targeted
interventions; and (b) the small number of targeted interventions, indicating low
coverage of some high-risk groups and no coverage of others.67

5.8         The quality and likely efficacy of subprojects financed under GARFUND
suffered because of insufficient rigor in the review of subproject proposals and
NGO/CBO capacity, thus undermining their results orientation and their potential
development impact. Both development partners and regional- and district-level
actors noted that selection/approval of proposals was not sufficiently rigorous.
Development partners noted that many technically inadequate proposals were
approved. District-level actors noted that while GAC approval of NGO subproject
proposals was contingent on endorsement by the districts, in actual fact districts were
encouraged to dispatch proposals immediately to GAC for their rapid approval,
without reviewing or commenting on them.68 GAC and UNAIDS documented that
the selection of NGOs and CBOs "...is done each year only considering the
organizations that have not received support in previous years (GAC, 2005)." Many,
if not most, NGOs and CBOs were inexperienced in designing and implementing
HIV/AIDS prevention activities, but this practice of approving subprojects submitted
by implementing agencies that had not previously received GARFUND financing
encouraged them to join the effort.69

5.9         Prevention activities did not receive the requisite technical guidance and
support. District focal persons had neither the time nor the expertise to provide
technical guidance70. The consequences of this were evident in some billboards,


66 GARFUND financed development of 17 productions for TV (a few comprised of several episodes); 13 radio productions; and
6 music productions on various HIV/AIDS topics which aimed to increase knowledge about the risks and methods of protection;
stigma and discrimination; the national policy and program; and NGO efforts (GAC, 2006).
67 Coverage estimates are notional at best because mapping and counting of high-risk groups were not undertaken. Evidence of
extremely low coverage of high transmission groups by Ghana's AIDS efforts more generally is also documented in the 2002-
2003 National HIV/AIDS Accounts (Figure 4). Recently, development partners have incorporated targets of increased coverage
of high-risk groups and geographical areas into the policy matrix of the multi-donor budget support initiative.
68 The Borrower, in its comments (Annex H-1), has noted that District AIDS Committees (DACS) reviewed and recommended
proposals for the 3rd and 4th calls but not for the 1st and 2nd calls during which time DAC capacity was considered to be weak.
69 Development partners and local-level actors alike noted that the availability of financing under GARFUND brought a
significant proliferation of NGOs and CBOs, some of them created for noble reasons, but others established simply to access
funds.
70 The Borrower, in its comments (Annex H-1), cites some training and guidance provided with other financing, but also notes
considerable turnover of focal persons.

posters and other material that were inappropriate, considered offensive to certain
groups, technically incorrect and/or risked further stimulating fear, stigma and
discrimination. The failure to fill the Technical Director post in the GAC Secretariat
and the exclusion of MoH from the GARFUND combined to undermine the provision
of needed and requested71 technical assistance and supervision or regional and
district-level activities.

5.10        The opportunity to improve the effectiveness of activities over time was
undermined by the failure to undertake essential operational research. Very little
operational research was supported by GARFUND at the regional and district levels
in order to improve                  Figure 4. Expenditures by Target Group as a Percent of Total

5.11        There are no documented trends in awareness, knowledge, attitudes, and
behaviors among the general population or among high-risk groups over the period
of project implementation, data which might have suggested plausible impact on
new infections. Evidence gathered through field visits provides some insight,
although it must be interpreted very carefully.

5.12        Field visits indicate a likely increase in the knowledge of modes of HIV
transmission and prevention methods among the general population and among
youth. Informants in the regions and districts visited noted that the creation and work
of the RACs and DACs, and the expanded prevention activities of civil society and


71Regional- and district-level actors widely noted the absence of sound, pedagogical supervision and their need for guidance in
the design and implementation of their activities.
72This was a strong recurring theme of IEG's field discussions and corroborated by central level actors and development
partners, alike. A wide range of topics for operational research was suggested by respondents, including (but not limited to):
the tendency to hide rather than bring rape cases to justice; the behaviors and role of parents in protecting youth; the belief that
sex with virgins will cure AIDS; the practice of wife inheritance; effective messages for Muslim youth; behavioral
underpinnings of specific groups and the dynamics of the epidemic (causes and consequences of behaviors of street children,
customs/border workers; port workers; migrant workers, etc.).

                                                              24


other sectors in the regions and districts (financed by GARFUND and by other
sources) have stepped up considerably the open discussion of HIV/AIDS, its risks and
ways and means of preventing its spread, at the local, community and individual
level. They note that, as a consequence of the increased detail and frequency with
which HIV/AIDS prevention messages are disseminated, knowledge has increased in
their respective districts. Because a great majority of these discussions and activities
were targeted at the general adult population and youth, both in and out of school, it is
plausible to assume that levels of knowledge within these groups would have
increased during the life of GARFUND. On the other hand, respondents did not cite
any perceptible changes in knowledge among any of the high-risk groups nor were
any trend data available.73

5.13       Field visits provided no indication of significant changes in levels of fear,
stigma and discrimination associated with HIV/AIDS during the period of GARFUND
implementation. Informants from virtually all regions/districts visited, including
PLWHA, noted that fear, stigma discrimination have not improved in the last several
years. The demand to be tested is still low, despite the fact that VCT services are
increasingly available.74 Discussion with RAC members and implementers in one
region raised the issue of counselors violating the confidentiality of their relationship
with those being tested. Few who test positive seek support, as this would mean
disclosing their status. It was pointed out that the decision not to disclose one's status
is not limited to those who are uneducated; even civil servants testing positive choose
not to disclose their status. A discussion with RAC members and implementers
revealed that families often present their PLWHA family members as victims of food
poisoning.

5.14       Numerous associations of PLWHA were formed over the period 2002-200575
and more are reported to be reaching out to populations to share their experiences.
A number of respondents observed that the holding of monthly meetings of these
groups at the regional and district levels has the potential for combating stigma and
discrimination. However, current membership represents a small fraction of the
estimated number of PLWHAs. Discussions in the field revealed cases of mothers
prohibiting their children from attending PLWHA association meetings for fear of
family dishonor. PLWHAs have indicated that despite meetings and outreach and
income generation activities of associations, they have observed no change in stigma
and discrimination over the past several years.

5.15       Field visits and data on condom sales indicate an increase in condom use
during GARFUND implementation. Respondents in various regions/districts visited
reported that demand for condoms seems to be rising, along with the availability and
sales of condoms. One region (Upper East) reported a likely increase in use, based on
the fact that more and more criminals arrested were found to have condoms in their
pockets. Indeed, the annual sale of condoms in Ghana rose from 24 million to 30
million between 2002 and 2005. Sales had increased more rapidly in the years prior to


73This is not to state conclusive evidence that knowledge did not increase among any of these groups, only to note that there
was no indication of any changes that IEG could find.
74The RAC of Bolgatanga estimated that 10 percent of adults have been tested, and most of those are women.
75Statistics on total number of PLWHA associations in the country is not available, but GARFUND financed the subprojects of
13 and NACP/MoH with GFATM financing supported 27.

                                                                25


GARFUND rising from 10 million in 1998 to 24 million in 2002. A major social
marketing program supported by USAID is likely to have been instrumental in
achieving these sales. While it is plausible that GARFUND interventions may also
have contributed, such contributions are likely to have been modest because (a)
condom promotion and distribution made up a very small part of all subproject
activities and (b) the bulk of prevention efforts were focused more on IEC than on
behavior change. Other regions (in the north, as well as in the south/port areas)
reported that young men are resisting condom use. They are hesitant to access
condoms where they would be available publicly because they would be labeled as a
"bad boy." Informants in various districts visited and at the national level also
reported that religious leaders are uncomfortable with condom promotion and
encourage abstinence (for youth) and fidelity (for married couples).

5.16       It is not possible to document trends in new HIV infections in Ghana during
the life of GARFUND, either in the general population, or among high-risk groups.
At the time of project design (2000), an estimated 3.0 percent of ANC women were
HIV positive and a target was set to maintain HIV prevalence in this group at 6
percent or below.76 While the prevalence of HIV in Ghana fell, trends in HIV
prevalence are not a valid indicator of trends in new infections. A decline in HIV
prevalence could conceivably be the result of high AIDS mortality or unsuccessful
treatment efforts,77 while an increase could signal more widespread and successful
treatment.

5.17       Trends in HIV prevalence in the youngest age cohort of pregnant women (15-
19 years) can serve as a proxy for infection rates, as this group has not been sexually
active as long as the older groups and is less likely to experience AIDS mortality.
HIV prevalence rates in this age group in Ghana show significant decline, from 2.3
percent in 2002 to 0.8 percent in 2005. However, this trend must also be interpreted
with caution. First, it is a proxy for infection rates in that particular group only
(pregnant women, attending ANC clinics, aged 15-19), and should not interpreted as
an indication of infection trends in other groups (all pregnant women, all age groups,
all men and women, for example). Second, changes in the composition of sentinel
sites over time, as well as changes in fertility as a result of infections with other STDs
can lead to spurious trends, which may not be reflective of the actual situation.

5.18       Data on HIV prevalence among commercial sex workers were collected in the
cities of Accra (2001) and Kumasi (2002), documenting high rates among seaters (76
percent and 54 percent, respectively) and somewhat lower rates among roamers (23
percent and 15 percent, respectively).78 In 2006 data were collected again for the
cities of Accra/Tema and Kumasi documenting rates among seaters (52 percent in
Accra/Tema and 39 percent in Kumasi) and roamers (37 percent in Accra/Tema and
24 percent in Kumasi).79 It is not clear to what extent these trends are attributable to
AIDS mortality, successful treatment and/or high turnover within each cohort. No


76This target was set on the basis of information available in 1999 when it was assumed that (a) 4.6 percent of the adult
population was infected; and (b) prevalence was rising (Measures Project and GAC, 2003).
77This is particularly relevant to the Ghana context as ART was rolled out in the country during the life of GARFUND.

trends are available on new infections or HIV prevalence rates during the time of
GARFUND implementation among other high-risk groups identified during project
preparation (truck drivers, prisoners, military, border, port/harbor workers, miners,
migrants, other). Neither baseline data nor end-of-project data were collected on any
of these groups.

Reduce the impact of AIDS on those who are infected and their families

5.19       GARFUND's contribution to this objective was measured in terms of the
supply of two services: (a) home-/community-based care of PLWHA; and (b) care of
orphans. The quality, appropriateness and effectiveness of these services in
mitigating the impact of AIDS on PLWHA, their families, and their orphans, remain
important, but unexplored questions.

5.20       The availability of home- and community-based services for the care and
support of PLWHA is reported by GAC and by most informants in most
regions/districts to have increased. Half of all districts now provide community-
based care for PLWHA, fully satisfying the 50 percent target set during the design
stage. According to GAC statistics, the project has supported home-based and
community-based care services for more than 30,000 PLWHA nationwide or about 8
percent of the total estimated number of PLWHA. It is difficult to appreciate this
coverage in the absence of (a) information on support to PLWHA financed by other
sources; and (b) the number of PLWHA that sought medical treatment (the
denominator).80

5.21       The absence of a functional referral system between the health system and
community-based care likely reduced the efficacy of home-based care interventions.
The project target was to achieve functional referral systems in 40 percent of districts
by the project's closing. While they have not been systematically measured, the
quality, effectiveness and sustainability of community-based services are likely to be
deficient in the absence of established links with the formal health system, through
which these services should receive referral and technical support and guidance.81 A
GAC-commissioned study in 2003 documented the low number of home-based care
initiatives in 2003. In that year, of the 40 home-based care programs, 21 were
managed by FBOs, 13 by NGOs, 5 by government and 1 by a CBO. This report
noted that both the quality and coverage of existing home-based care programs were
low.82

5.22       The geographic coverage of orphan support activities met GARFUND
targets, but the efficacy and efficiency of these efforts are uncertain. By the end of
GARFUND, 35 percent of all districts were reported to be providing care for about
17,500 orphans, exceeding the project target of 30 percent. But the spectrum and
combinations of support are wide and varied, including payment of school fees,


80 The project target was to achieve a coverage of 30 percent of all PLWHA that sought medical treatment.
81 NACP/MoH support for care and treatment consists of treatment of OIs and ART and supporting activities (ART
management, capacity building of service personnel). In 2004, 4,504 patients were receiving HIV clinical care through the
public health system, of which 2001 were receiving ART. There was no indication in its annual report of the provision of
technical support and guidance to home and community-based care. Guidelines for managing OIs and on managing the side
effects of ART were produced, but it is not clear if these were made available to care-givers outside the health system (NACP
2004).

provision of nutritional supplements, medical assistance, housing, etc. A UNICEF
study, commissioned and financed by the GAC in 2004, provides insights into the
nature and effectiveness of GARFUND assistance to AIDS orphans through a
community foster care program developed by the Queen Mothers of Manya Krobo
district in Eastern Region (Box 3).83 While Queen Mothers had traditionally financed
the care of orphans with monthly dues paid by members of their association, starting
around 2000 they sought and received training, financial and other solicited support
from NGOs and international agencies. In 2002-2003 they received a GARFUND
grant of about US$30,000, supplemented by US$20,000 from other sources.84

Box 3. Queen Mother's Community Foster Program for Children Affected by HIV/AIDS, Manya
Krobo District, Eastern Region: Findings of a 2004 Review

   The Queen Mothers Association supports a total of 600 children, including those whose parent(s) die or become
too ill to care for them. About 10 percent of foster parents subcontracted the care of their foster children to
persons who were unknown to the program manager of the Queen Mothers Association and therefore
unsupervised. Feeding costs were calculated on the basis of three meals, but most children ate only twice a day
and foster children from Upper Manya were found to be less well nourished overall. Only 52 percent of foster
children were in school at the time of the study because GARFUND support had not been received for 2004. The
health needs of the orphans were poorly addressed, with only two of the children tested for HIV and none of the
children receiving vitamins, malaria prevention treatment or insecticide treated bed nets for sleeping. Only four
seropositive orphans had been taken to a health facility in the year of the study. Yet, foster parents claimed an
average of US$15 in health expenditures per child per month. The psychosocial needs were found not to be
adequately addressed for many of the children who suffer from anxiety, depression, discrimination and
stigmatization, although orphans were found to be better integrated into their foster families than those in other
programs with less stigmatization and discrimination within the community. Over 80 percent of children were
related to their foster parents. Nevertheless, about two-thirds of 50 orphans interviewed reported being subjected
to emotional abuse, 24 percent to physical abuse, 10 percent to neglect, and 4 percent to sexual abuse. Other forms
of maltreatment were reported by foster children, including denial of food, insults and beatings. Over 80 percent
were found to be engaged in income generating activities, ranging from daily hawking of wares to hard labor
(crushing stones in a quarry), 44 percent of whom were under 15 years old.

   There were no formal selection criteria for foster parents or foster children and no limits on the number of foster
children per household, with some foster parents caring for as many as six children, netting considerably more
than the average household income in the district. Only 25 percent of parents had been trained in the care and
support of PLWHA. The Manya Krobo District Social Welfare office was found to be inadequately staffed and
under-resourced, with just two field officers, already overstretched with a wide range of responsibilities, and
lacking basic training in the care of orphans and vulnerable children, and in HIV counseling and care. Neither did
this office have the basic infrastructure and logistics to carry out its critical role of counseling, oversight and
supervision.

* See inside cover of this report for definition of relevance, efficacy, and outcome.

6.2         The overall relevance of the project is modest. The relevance of project
objectives is substantial. They are responsive both to the Government's past (2001-
2005) and current (2006-2011) HIV/AIDS Strategic Frameworks, and to the Bank's
previous and current CAS, which emphasize poverty reduction and human
development, with specific focus on the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS and the
mitigation of its impact.

6.3         The relevance of project design, on the other hand, was modest. The design
did not ensure that activities implemented would be the most responsive to the
priorities of Ghana's particular epidemic, which, as noted in the national strategy and
the design document, was concentrated in certain groups and in certain regions. The
project's drive to mobilize and support as broad a range of actors working in as many
communities as possible diverted attention away from high-impact interventions
specified in the design document and from the strategic use of civil society
organizations and various sector agencies to address hard-to-reach groups, in line
with their comparative advantages. The project logframe was not systematic in
developing a coherent results chain with strong links between inputs, outputs,
outcomes and impact.

6.4         The institutional framework for program/project management and
implementation did not build on existing capacities and frameworks at central and
decentralized levels. The adequacy of existing institutional arrangements for
HIV/AIDS was not sufficiently assessed. Over and above the exclusion of MoH
activities from GARFUND financing (World Bank, 2000b), the organizational
structure and mandate of the GAC and the GAC Secretariat (Act 613 of Parliament,
January 2002) significantly reduced the role of the MoH, curtailing its potential to
provide needed technical guidance to efforts at national, regional and district levels
(Box 4).85 M&E focal persons operating at the regional and district levels had neither
the adequate time, nor the proper training to carry out their responsibilities.
Decentralization of the HIV/AIDS effort was also hampered by GARFUND
arrangements whereby NGOs and FBOs were contracted centrally by the GAC,
reported directly to the GAC and, as a consequence, did not feel accountable to RACs
and DACs, which were supposed to supervise them.

6.5         Overall the efficacy of the objective to reduce new HIV infections was
modest. HIV prevalence rates among young pregnant women (15-19 years) attending
ANC clinics indicate a possible decline in new infections in that particular group. The
lack of trend data on knowledge attitudes and behavior is one reason for this rating.
Another is that support is likely to have had modest impact, at best, on any changes in


85The Borrower, in its comments (Annex H-2) notes that the poor relationship between MoH and the Ghana Health Service
(GHS) made it difficult to implement GARFUND. However, field visits and interviews attributed these issues to poor
coordination and unclear division of roles and responsibilities between GAC and the health sector at national, regional and
district levels, and not to issues between MoH and the GHS.

knowledge, attitude and behaviors, given: inadequate focus on behavior change and
high-risk groups despite nationally-set and project-specific targets to this end, lack of
operational research to assess and enhance the cost-effectiveness of interventions,
lack of technical rigor in selection/approval of proposals, low capacity of
implementers, and inadequate technical guidance and support to implementing
agencies during subproject implementation.

6.6       Efficacy of the objective to reduce the impact of AIDS on those already
infected and affected was also modest. The availability of home- and community-
based services for the care and support of PLWHA and orphans and vulnerable
children increased over the life of GARFUND. However, field visits and interviews
indicate that the quality, effectiveness and sustainability of these services suffer from
the absence of established links with the formal health system. These services do not
receive referral and technical support and guidance, which is essential to the quality
of care, and which clearly falls under the mandate of the MoH. Likewise, available
evidence suggests that the additional care and support for OVC financed by
GARFUND was lacking in quality. Civil society organizations delivering services to
orphans and PLWHA were unanimous in expressing their concern about the
sustainability of these services.

6.7       The efficiency with which project objectives were achieved is negligible.
There was a poor fit of project indicators and design with the epidemiology of
HIV/AIDS and the sociology and economics of behaviors particular to Ghana and its
regions and subregions, which were reflected in Ghana's own strategy. As a
consequence, there was insufficient targeting and prioritization of activities around:
high risk groups, high-risk regions, high-risk behaviors, and places of high-risk
activity or high vulnerability, as a complement to Ghana's effort to undertake
prevention activities that would benefit the general population. Much effort and
expenditure were devoted to IEC activities, even though (a) awareness was already
universal at the project's outset (para. 1.4) and (b) Ghana's strategy advocated a shift
away from IEC and towards behavior change interventions. More attention to
targeted behavior change would have significantly enhanced the potential impact of
subprojects. These were neglected, despite a call for increased attention on the
occasion of the MTR.

6.8       At the time of project design MoH was responsible for leading the fight
against HIV/AIDS in Ghana. This effort was multi-sectoral and decentralized to the
regional level, with promising pilots ongoing at the district level (DRI). A review of
HIV/AIDS efforts at that time suggested that MoH could be more effective with
increases in its staffing and financing and by raising the NACP sufficiently in the
hierarchy. The failure to build on existing efforts, experience, and initiatives created
inefficiencies in implementation, as: (a) a new institution and new staff, not involved
in national strategy formulation or project preparation, took up their responsibilities at
the time of project launch; and (b) the MoH, which had led and continues to play a
critical role, was alienated. This was especially problematic since the Technical
Director position in the GAC Secretariat was never filled.86 The push to expand


86The Borrower in its comments (Annex H-2) reports that it did undertake efforts to fill this position, but these efforts were
unsuccessful.

                                                               30


rapidly the national response seems to have come at the expense of quality and impact
of the 3000+ subprojects, some of which were carried out by inexperienced civil
society and public sector organizations, a number of which were not completed, and
few (if any) of which were evaluated for results. GARFUND's practice to approve
and finance subprojects proposed by new NGOs/CBOs at each round and not to
provide more financing of NGOs/CBOs that had received funding in previous rounds
may have been effective in expanding the number and range of implementers of
HIV/AIDS activities in the country. However, it was a very inefficient approach for
achieving sustainable results and building capacity. The failure to utilize and support
GHANET in its mandate to coordinate the work of over 100 NGOs in carrying out
HIV/AIDS activities was a missed opportunity both to utilize existing capacity and to
expand capacity of civil society.87

6.9         Risks to Development Outcome. The risk that development outcomes will
not maintained or realized is significant. The technical resilience (and efficacy) of
efforts is likely to suffer unless the Technical Director position in the GAC
Secretariat is filled and coordination/collaboration with MoH improves. Continual
financing of HIV/AIDS prevention and mitigation activities by thousands of civil
society organizations is unlikely to be sustained unless external financing is secured
for the long-run. Ownership of and commitment to HIV/AIDS activities by public
sector agencies, and their willingness to provide counterpart funding for HIV/AIDS
will continue to be fragile unless agencies are selectively supported and trained and
develop a full understanding of the dynamics and impacts of the epidemic as they
relate to their particular sector and their role and comparative advantage to contribute
to the fight. Governance issues, raised in GAC meetings and in many public arenas,
including the press, will continue to undermine development outcome unless and until
mechanisms are refined for ensuring accountability for results and proper use of
financial resources.

6.10        The Bank's performance during preparation was moderately unsatisfactory.
Insufficient attention was paid to the analysis and integration of country-specific
evidence, experience, lessons, ongoing efforts and initiatives, institutional
arrangements and capacity, and outlook.88 Furthermore, the strategic relevance and
approach of the project were undermined both by the decision to eliminate MoH from
the GARFUND design and by the failure to underpin the importance of mapping and
effectively covering key target populations. In essence, project design focused on
fiduciary, institutional and implementation aspects and failed to analyze or develop
sufficiently the epidemiological and strategic foundations of program and project
design. Weak project design was also reflected in a logframe which did not establish
links between inputs, outputs, outcomes and impact and which was deficient in its
choice of indicators and in the establishment of baseline data on key indicators. Even
in the context of a rapid preparation process, the Bank could have (a) integrated more



87The Borrower, in its comments (Annex H-1), notes that GHANET was supported by other sources to establish its secretariat,
but the fact remains that its capacity for networking outreach was not utilized under GARFUND.
88Both officials and technical staff involved in GARFUND preparation and development partners noted that the Bank's team
did not listen to their opinions, concerns and advice on the Bank's proposed support and on ideas and opportunities to coordinate
and collaborate.

                                                                31


fully into the design the technical and economic aspects; and (b) reflected more the
experience and perspectives of Government and development partners alike.

6.11       The Bank's performance during supervision was unsatisfactory. While
supervision inputs were adequate, the Bank's supervision missions were devoted
primarily to implementation issues, ensuring that the review, approval and financing
of subprojects were carried out expeditiously so as to accelerate both the mobilization
of actors and the disbursement of funds for the implementation of subprojects.
Development partners raised concern about what they considered to be the Bank's
almost exclusive focus on rapid disbursement and their unavailability to engage in a
meaningful dialogue with them, especially to listen to their concerns about the
development effectiveness of HIV/AIDS efforts in Ghana. They noted that the mid-
term review was a missed opportunity to correct certain issues of project design and
focus that were raised, but not effectively addressed. They also observed that the
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) mission marked the first time during
implementation that the Bank was sufficiently disciplined in its focus on the project
development objectives. These observations are corroborated by a review of internal
Bank reports, which reported GARFUND's success on the basis of trends in HIV
prevalence, even though this is a meaningless indicator with respect to either
objective and, which paid particular attention to the monitoring of fiduciary
requirements, implementation issues and process. Technical/public health and quality
aspects were not sufficiently reviewed or supported. Field-based actors and
implementers interviewed at decentralized levels expressed their wish that the Bank
missions would have engaged in more substantive dialogue with them and given them
more technical feedback and advice during their visits on how to improve the
development effectiveness of their efforts. On the other hand, the GAC Secretariat
expressed strong appreciation of the Bank's performance during supervision.

6.12       Performance issues were raised on a number of occasions during
implementation, but not rigorously followed up on. The interim review of
GARFUND, conducted in 2004 by ACTafrica89 as a part of a broader interim review
of MAP investments to date, raised salient issues about performance and outcome.90
Bank sector management comments on supervision reports also highlighted areas of
concern.91 However, the thrust of reviews were, by and large, positive and focused
primarily on implementation issues and much less on results. The drive to mobilize
actors and disburse funds was accorded top priority.

6.13       Borrower Performance was moderately unsatisfactory overall. After initial
delays, due in part to a change in government and in part to the establishment of the


89 AIDS Campaign Team for Africa (ACTafrica) was established in 1999 in the Africa Region to provide resources and
technical support to country teams to mainstream HIV/AIDS activities in all sectors and, the following year, to support the
implementation of MAPs.
90 Among the issues/concerns raised in this interim review were: NSF not being evidence-based, exclusion of MoH from
GARFUND, inadequate coordination among partners, low capacity/lack of accountability of CSOs, weak performance on
knowledge management and capacity building, weak M&E, and need for stronger technical support provided by the Bank.
91 The lead specialist, on behalf of the sector manager, did raise a number of areas of concern for follow-up action over a series
of ISR, including the importance of : carrying out second generation surveillance, a focus on development objectives in spite of
pressure for fast implementation, stronger linkages with MoH, stronger partnerships with donors, GAC transcending its PIU role
to take on program coordination, collecting data on key indicators, a results-based MTR, moving away from awareness raising to
behavior change.

                                             32


GAC, the performance of the GAC Secretariat in its capacity as project
implementation unit (PIU) for the GARFUND was moderately satisfactory. It
fulfilled the basic functions of a PIU, especially those on which the Bank placed great
emphasis: implementation of a new, innovative project in the space of in three and
one half years; accelerated disbursements; the engagement of a broad range of civil
society actors for a multi-sectoral response; and the satisfaction of fiduciary and
reporting requirements specified in the development credit agreement. However, the
GAC Secretariat's performance was weaker with regard to the technical (public
health) and quality aspects of GARFUND. Its failure to monitor and evaluate project
performance as initially envisaged undermined both its learning-by-doing approach
and the accountability for results of the broad range of stakeholders supported under
the project.

6.14    The performance of the GAC (including its Secretariat) in fulfillment of its
mandate to coordinate and manage a multi-sectoral response was moderately
unsatisfactory. First, it was noted by a number of development partners that during
the life of GARFUND the GAC Secretariat devoted itself almost exclusively to the
role of PIU for the Bank and, as a consequence, neglected some of its core
responsibilities to enable and facilitate the work of the GAC, which oversees the
entire national HIV/AIDS program. Second, the failure to fill the position of
Technical Director of the GAC Secretariat (despite GAC efforts to this end)
undermined the ability of the GAC to strategically manage the technical content and
quality of HIV/AIDS program efforts. The GAC Secretariat has indicated that this
void was filled in part by their efforts to solicit the technical support of MoH.
However, (a) there were tensions between MoH and GAC that persisted throughout
the life of GARFUND that affected both the quality and quantity of MoH support; (b)
the interface between GAC and MoH was weak at national, regional and district
levels; and (c) as a consequence, GARFUND subprojects continued to suffer from
poor technical quality and inadequate public health content. Third, program
monitoring and evaluation arrangements were inadequately implemented (e.g.,
baseline mapping and assessment of coverage of high-risk groups). GAC's failure to
ensure the refinement and implementation of its draft M&E plan for 2001-2006, as
well as to utilize data for tracking program performance and strategic decision-
making, constitutes a significant shortcoming in Government's performance.
Development partners noted that their dialogue with the GAC emphasized the
importance of harmonized and disciplined M&E for improved strategic direction and
management, but without much success. Finally, the failure of (most) non-health
public sector agencies financed under GARFUND to budget adequate counterpart
financing for their HIV/AIDS plans, for which they received GARFUND financing
(World Bank internal reporting), indicates that commitment and conviction within the
Borrower's public sector agencies are still in need of improvement.

6.15    For reasons presented in Chapter 4, the design and implementation of
arrangements for GARFUND monitoring and evaluation and for the utilization of
data produced for decision-making were negligible.

7. Lessons and Challenges

Lessons

7.1     The drive to accelerate disbursements and to spread the financing across a
wide range of implementers, activities and geographic areas poses the risk that
these process goals could take precedence over the quality of interventions, as well
as the strategic selection and prioritization of the highest-impact activities. Ghana's
HIV epidemic remains largely concentrated in high-risk groups; it is essential to
reduce the highest-risk behavior to prevent the spread to the general population.
However, simply putting the high-priority interventions on the menu of eligible
activities was not sufficient to ensure that they would get done, or that adequate
coverage of the highest-risk groups and areas would be ensured.

7.2     A more strategic choice and sustained use of implementers with the
experience and capacity to carry out the highest impact interventions likely would
have resulted in stronger and more sustainable results. GARFUND supported over
70 public sector agencies and over 3,000 civil society organizations. The
prioritization and more in-depth support of fewer, high-impact sectors would likely
have enhanced considerably GARFUND's contribution to national prevention
objectives and, as a consequence, its impact on the epidemic. Moreover, the practice
of awarding GARFUND financing to new agencies and organizations with each new
call for proposals, rather than providing sustained support to experienced ones, is
likely to have mitigated GARFUND's potential impact.

7.3     Efforts to strengthen a multi-sectoral response would likely have been more
successful had synergies been created with the MoH, capitalizing on technical and
operational expertise. GARFUND's experience has shown that limiting health
sector's role primarily to the clinical and medical, and failure to build these synergies
risks compromising the quality and effectiveness of the prevention and care services
being undertaken by non-health sector implementers. A project design, which would
have fully engaged the MoH's technical capacity to ensure quality in key areas at
national, regional and district levels, might have facilitated the fulfillment of the
GAC's key role of coordination, which was found by partners to be neglected. This
issue was raised during the MTR, but not adequately addressed.

7.4     "Learning-by-doing" has the potential to improve effectiveness, but it is
unlikely to take place in the absence of strong preparation and incentives for
systematic monitoring and evaluation. In GARFUND this approach was to be
supported by a strong M&E component to track program performance and outcome,
and operational research to document and refine the effectiveness of interventions in
the various local contexts in Ghana, but these were never well defined during
preparation. Incentives for GAC to disburse quickly and for implementers to manage
and account for financial resources were much stronger than incentives to learn or to
be accountable for the effectiveness of interventions and for results. There were no
incentives for evaluation and improved performance in the project design.

Box 4. Role of MoH in the Context of the GAC

   The GAC, when it was established in 2002,assumed numerous responsibilities that had previously been assigned
to NACP/MoH, notably: coordination of the national response; consensus building; policy development; technical
support to other stakeholders; resource mobilization and allocation; research; donor coordination; and monitoring
and evaluation.92 NACP/MoH retained responsibility for implementation of HIV/AIDS activities falling within a
very narrowly defined mandate for MoH: the more clinical aspects of prevention, voluntary counseling and testing,
and treatment and care of PLWHA.93 Among the 47 members of the Commission, two are from MoH: the Minister
of Health and the Program Manager of the NACP. The MoH is also represented on the Steering Committee of the
GAC and on the "Prevention Care" and "Care and Support" Committees. A Technical Services Division, created
within the GAC Secretariat was assigned responsibilities for which MoH had the expertise, experience and the
tradition to execute: "...technical guidance, supervision and coordination of technical services, including prevention
and control of HIV/AIDS, clinical care and support of people living with HIV/AIDS." IEC, also traditionally a
responsibility of MoH, became the responsibility of the GAC Secretariat's Policy, Planning, Research, Monitoring
and Evaluation Division (p. 36 of the Act). This institutional set-up, for which GARFUND financed the salaries
and most operating costs, translated into the suboptimal involvement of the lead technical ministry in the new multi-
sectoral framework.

Challenges

7.5        A follow-on HIV/AIDS operation, the Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS Project (M-
SHAP), was approved on November 2005 and became effective on March 15, 2006.
Co-financed by IDA (US$20 million), DFID (US$8.3 million) and GoG (US$7.0
million), this project supports the development objectives of NSF II (2006-2011) to:
reduce new infection among vulnerable groups and the general population; mitigate
the impact of the epidemic; and promote healthy life-styles.

7.6        The design of M-SHAP reviewed and attempted to incorporate key lessons of
experience gained from GARFUND design and implementation,94which point to the
importance of: according priority to high-risk groups and high-risk areas; assisting the
GAC to assume its role of coordination, facilitation and oversight; routine site visits
to ensure accountability of subprojects and other decentralized activities for proper
use of resources and for delivering on contract commitments; stronger, more
collaborative linkages between GAC and MoH;95 strengthened partnerships (among
development partners and between development partners and GAC) in favor of a
program approach; and further strengthening of M&E systems. The Bank's efforts to
compile these lessons and to address them under the M-SHAP hold promise for
improving the development effectiveness of the Bank's support to HIV/AIDS in
Ghana.

7.7        The findings and lessons from this PPAR indicate additional opportunities to
improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Bank's support to national HIV/AIDS
efforts. These include: being more strategic in the choice and support of public sector
and civil society actors; strengthening the technical capacity of the institutional

framework by drawing on health sector expertise and experience for policy-making
and for technical oversight and support; the strengthening of M&E, operational

indicators for systematic tracking of coverage and trends among high-risk groups, as

and (c) designing a research agenda that will address key programmatic issues and
underpin efforts to enhance the cost-effectiveness of interventions specific to the
multiple contexts of Ghana.

Box C.1. Ghana's HIV/AIDS Response as of 2000
Promotion of Safer Sex through ABC strategy
·   Information: mass media campaigns (print and electronic) since 1986; talk shows, films and theatre; school
    curriculum programmes; peer education (youth, commercial sex workers, work place), with involvement of:
    Ministries of Health, Communications, Education; NGOs, FBOs civil society groups; private for-profit sector
·   Condom distribution: in clinical settings through MoH, private sector distribution (commercial and social
    marketing) and peer distribution
Clinical Response
·   Preventing and managing STDs: Strengthening STD Management within the Ghana Health Service (GHS)
    and in the private sector; : strengthening STD management in basic health care service; integration of STD
    management into family planning services; and training of nurse tutors; targeting high-risk groups (e.g.,
    specialized clinics providing preventive and curative services for CSW with involvement of police)
·   Preventing HIV Transmission through Blood Transfusion and : supplying safe blood for transfusion;
    programs to minimize blood transfusion
·   Reducing other iatrogenic transmissions: a number of policies and protocols in place for improved
    infection control in the health care setting and in other traditional practices (traditional surgical procedures,
    barbers and hairdressers' practices)
·   Reducing mother-to-child transmission: No official policy; nothing being done.
·   Institutional care of PLWHA: virtually non-existant (protocol exists, but fear among health workers);
    many PLWHAs isolated or sent away.
·   Voluntary counseling and testing: not available in Ghana, but several NGO proposals under development
    for its introduction
Community and social response
·   Community and social response: most AIDS cases are cared for at home, but home-based care is the least
    developed component of the continuum of care within the HIV/AIDS program, weak linkage with health
    services and no training/supervision; community-level support of PLWHA and families and intensive home-
    based care is carried out under a number of initiatives and pilots ; in 2000 about 5 functional associations of
    PLWHA
·   District response initiative: a strategy to decentralize the national HIV/AIDS response and to improve its
    management at the district level. since late 90s, adopted DRI to move towards a more integrated,
    multisectoral and development-oriented approach through a partnership between Ministry of Employment
    and Social Welfare, 10 administrative districts and UNAIDS/WHO, including support of management
    capacity building and activities implementation by communities, local NGOs and institutions. Ashanti region
    first poised for full implementation.
Legal and human rights response:
·   There are no HIV/AIDS specific laws to protect the rights of PLWHA. HIV/AIDS policy provides guidance
    on rights (e.g., informed consent for testing, counseling and confidentiality of status), but there are problems
    with its implementation. IEC on human rights and destigmatization have been limited. No
    coordination/capacity building of major stakeholders: Ministry of Employment and social welfare, Chiefs,
    Police, CHRAJ, Judiciary, MoH, District assemblies, NGOs.
Management and Coordination:
·   @ national level: NACP mandate, a technical working group chaired by deputy Minister of Health,
    including Ministries of Ed, social welfare, youth and sports, communications, donor agencies, platform for
    exchange, HIV/AIDS Thematic Group under UNAIDS, CHAG coordinates all mission hospitals and clinics;
    MoE Task force for AIDS prevention, MESW for DRI; GHANET coordinating over 100 NGOs.
·   @ regional level: NACP has part time regional coordinators; few regional AIDS Advisory Committees are
    functional
·   @ district level: DRI so new that results are yet to be known by promising.
Monitoring, Evaluation and Research:
·   M&E weak with some exceptions: Red Cross peer education programme; PPAG activities, national HIV
    epidemiological surveillance; too little effort spent on M&E; too few instances where programme
    effectiveness was critically reviewed.
·   Research: undertaken but influence not clear; absence of a central coordination mechanism for research and
    no coherent research agenda exist

Box C.2. The Way Forward
Promotion of safer sex:
·   Refine promotion of safer sex to be better targeted and more effective, more oriented around behavior change
    (versus IEC)
·   Increase availability and access to and targeting of quality condoms by building on and expanding various,
    non-clinical distribution mechanisms; studies on condom utilization to monitor change in safer sex behavior
Clinical Response
·   Improve the quality, targeting, coverage and monitoring of STD services
·   Further reduce transmission in health clinic and other settings (updating guidelines, monitor performance,
    improving quality assurance at decentralized levels, training, outreach)
·   Develop guidelines for MTCT and counseling and testing services for HIV+ women, pregnant and lactating
    mothers. Ensure perinatal anti-viral therapy
·   Develop VCT in urban and major centers/high-prevalence areas.
·   Upgrade guidelines, train staff, develop professional code of conduct, publicise exemptions policy
·   Support/expand PLWHA associations.
Community and district response
·   Link home based care to health services through referral, supervision, training
·   Strengthen community involvement/ownership and provide financial and material support
·   Accelerate and expand DRI and strengthen NACP visibility/technical support, which is critical to success
Legal and human rights response
·   Urgent review of the existing human rights laws; develop laws, policies, programs, plans; sensitize; modify
    laws that encourage harassment of sex workers, inhibit sex-worker interventions; campaigns to reduce
    discrimination, and stigma; actions to fight against discrimination: employment, treatment, representation,
    legal system/network. .
Management/Coordination & M&E
·   Study 3 options to improve overall national coordination: second other actors to NACP and raise its hierarchy
    in MoH; a supra-ministerial body representing different sectors of society in office of VP, with NACP as
    secretariat; group of cabinet Ministers ensures coordination of activities with strong management bodies w/in
    each sector.
·   A number of HIV/AIDS coordination mechanisms do exist and multisectoral coordination needs to be
    investigated and improved at the district, regional and national levels.
·   Accelerate and simplify and expand the DRI
·   All parties need to keep track of process and results, for which national guidelines, including a selection of
    indicators, needs to be developed. Capacities for M&E, better mechanisms for reporting
·   High political commitment must be sustained and permeated down to all pol and adm levels in the country.

Source: Tallies sent by GAC to the Bank on March 1, 2007. Accompanying financial documentation was not forwarded with these
tallies.
* It is important to note that reimbursements requested are based on audits and field reviews which aimed to cover some 20 percent of all subprojects.
This means that the remaining 80 percent (over 2,400 subprojects) have not been audited or reviewed.
** GAC tallies of 159 subprojects show that expenditures were considered legitimate because a report was received. While in the field, IEG requested
that samples of reports from Parliamentarians but never received any, on which basis it could have gotten information on the type of expenditures
incurred, the types of activities undertaken and outputs. In the absence of this information, IEG reserves judgment on the legitimacy of these
expenditures. It is important to note that at the time of IEG's mission only 43 of the 159 Parliamentarians submitted reports, already a year after project
completion. The number of reports received increased 109 as of March 1, 1007, nearly two years after completion.

Annex H. Borrower's Comments

Annex H-1 - Comments of the Ghana Aids Commission (GAC) on Draft
GARFUND (Cr 3458-GH) Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR)

Submitted by Professor Awuku Amoa, Director General, GAC Secretariat

General Comments

a.     We note a major fundamental flaw in the procedure used by the Independent
Evaluation Group in collecting data for the report. The evaluators showed that field
data formed the basis of most of their conclusions and therefore, the rating of GAC's
performance. However, in standard practice data collected from the field should be
validated in order to produce a report reflecting the true situation. Thus data obtained
from the field, the development partners and other stakeholders should have been
validated by checking with GAC before the draft report was prepared. This would
have ensured fairness and justice to GAC, but was not done resulting in several
inaccuracies in the report.1

b.     Contrary to their stated methodology as on p. i, para. 2 of the Report, viz. ".To
prepare PPARs, IEGWB staff examine project files and other documents, interview
operational staff.........." the Evaluators never interviewed any of the project
management staff of the GAC Secretariat on the issues they examined. Neither did
they review nor cross-check findings from their field visits with the staff as would
have been expected. Besides the introductory meeting they held with the staff on the
first day of the exercise, they never met with the staff again, not even for a
debriefing.2

c.     The above inadequacies in methodology account for the factual inaccuracies and
misrepresentations that we identify in the Report.

d.     It is noted that in many instances, the Evaluators attribute GAC's performance
rating of unsatisfactory, as they assigned, to the absence of a Technical Director
within the GAC Secretariat.3 It is unfair to indict GAC on that since there are
justifiable reasons for the situation that existed (as provided on p.4 herein) and which
the Evaluators could have obtained from GAC Management so as to avoid the
distortions in the Report.
e.     Assessment is generally unfair to GAC for the fundamental reason that criteria
used were unknown to GAC at the onset of the project. It is illogical to use indicators


1 IEG notes that its conclusions are based on triangulation of evidence from many sources: interviews with stakeholders
(implementers, beneficiaries, officials, policymakers, and development partners), direct field observation, review of project and
program documentation and research.
2 IEG notes that the evaluation team met with the head and staff of the GAC Secretariat at the outset of the mission to explain its
purpose and methodology and a debriefing was held at the mission's end. Additional discussions with selected GAC Secretariat
staff were held on specific issues and topics. A liaison person from the GAC Secretariat facilitated the work of the mission,
contacts with staff and the provision of supplemental information from the GAC Secretariat after the team's return to
Washington. Annex B lists the staff of the GAC Secretariat with whom the IEG team met.
3 IEG notes that the PPAR rates the performance of GAC as the implementing agency as moderately satisfactory (not
unsatisfactory) and in its role of coordinator and manager of the national multisectoral HIV/AIDS effort as moderately
unsatisfactory.

                                                              72


that were not agreed upon and incorporated in the original project design for
assessment.4

f.      The Evaluators admit themselves (as they state in para. 6.3 of the Report) that
the project design was deficient in several respects. It should be noted that the design
was largely the blueprint of the World Bank which GAC was to implement. What
then is the justification for GAC's indictment whereas the project foundation itself
was poorly designed?

1.           Background and Context

· p. 1, para 1.1, line 3: use of the word rampant is inaccurate. What is the
justification?

2.           Objectives and Design

· p. 7, para 2.2, last sentence: `Because the ongoing Health SWAp was assumed to
be providing adequate financial support to all of MoH's programs, including
HIV/AIDS, GARFUND's design specifically excluded the support of HIV/AIDS
activities falling within MOH's mandate.'

i.      MOH was funded to undertake its HIV/AIDS activities and in a number of ways.
Funds were provided from the GARFUND to the Ghana Medical Association, Nurses
Association, Pharmacy Association, Laboratory Technicians all within MOH for
intervention activities. This is a clear indication that GARFUND did not exclude
support for MOH HIV/AIDS activities.

ii.     GARFUND provided support to numerous quasi government and private
hospitals. Activities funded included VCT, support to PLWHA and opportunistic
infections.'5

· p. 10, footnote 28. Statement that: ".... two factors might have discouraged
follow- on contracts; first was the general policy of GAC to mobilize as many NGOs
and CBOs as possible....; second was the reference to CBO support as `seed money'
implying a one-time investment to stimulate action" is incorrect.6

i.      The inability of most of the NGOs and CBOs to carry out repeater projects was
due to the policy that an implementing agency should complete its sub-project before


4In line with its objectives-based methodology, IEG evaluated the extent to which GARFUND achieved the objectives stated in
the design document and logframe (World Bank, 2000b). It assessed performance against project indicators for which trend data
were available, and assessed additional trends and information relevant to project objectives to compensate for the absence of
trend data on other project indicators.
5 This is clearly documented in the design document (World Bank, 2000b). According to GAC subproject tallies, the only MoH
program which received GARFUND financing under the public sector (MDA) window was the Onchocerciasis Program in the
amount of US$28,000 for capacity building, advocacy and VCT. No other direct financial support to MoH agencies was
provided under GARFUND. A small number of non-governmental entities did receive financing for health-related activities,
and are itemized in this report.
6 The evidence base for this statement was derived from: interviews with the former Bank Task Team Leaders and with GAC
staff (first factor); and the design document (World Bank 2000b) (second factor).

                                                              73


it could qualify for further funding. Most of them could not satisfy this requirement
by the time subsequent calls were advertised to solicit for proposals.

ii.   GAC did not consider support to CBOs as "seed money". Funds provided to
CBOs were based on contracts approved for sub-projects implementation within the
communities.

3.        Implementation and Costs
 · p.13, para. 3.5:             Average size of sub projects

The basis for determination of the figures quoted here is unclear. Upon the
presumption that they are based on selected sub-projects, one would like to know how
representative the samples examined for the various categories of implementers are.
We question the correctness of the figures.7

Under GARFUND and as agreed upon with the World Bank project supervisors and
consultants (and documented in the Operational Manual), contract sums were as
follows:

i.     MDAs were awarded cedi equivalent of $100,000

ii.    NGOs were awarded cedi equivalent of $25,000 or $20,000 dependent on the
NGOs sub project budget.

iii.   CBOs - initially were awarded $2,500 sub-project contract but when
NGOs/CBOs contracts were decentralized to the District Assemblies, each District
was awarded $15,000.

iv.    Private sector organizations on the average were awarded $25,000 per sub
project.

v.     PLWHA Associations: These associations sprang up after the end of
GARFUND project.                   We wonder how they could feature prominently in the
evaluators' report.

·      p. 13, paras. 3.6 & 3.7: GARFUND financing new, different NGOs/CBOs......
........GARFUND's practice of financing new, different NGOs/CBOs for every round
of proposals undermined the effectiveness and sustainability of capacity building
efforts.'

i.     It is inaccurate that GARFUND always sought to finance new, different
NGOs/CBOs for every round (call for proposals). The correct situation was that at
each call for proposals, old beneficiaries who had completed sub-projects previously
awarded and had reported and accounted on their funds could apply to implement
new sub-projects. Those with uncompleted projects at the time of the next call for


7IEG notes that data were calculated on the basis of end-of-project data provided by GAC/GARFUND, December 2005. A new
Table (E.2) has been added to Annex E to document calculations more fully.

                                           74


proposals could not apply for new sub projects. New NGOs/CBOs applied and
accessed the funds alongside old ones that had completed their sub-projects. It is
incorrect to state that GAC policy was to mobilize as many NGOs and CBOs as
possible. That was not its policy, hence not documented in the Operational Manual.
No criteria were established to exempt old NGO's from applying for new funding.
The District Assemblies evaluated, selected and awarded contracts to NGOs/CBOs
based on their District Strategic Plans. These were repeater contracts. We wonder
where the independent evaluators reviewed those sub projects.

ii.    p.13, para 3.7:  Statement that "Training was not based on capacity
assessment......" is incorrect. In 2002 through the SIPAA Project capacity assessment
of implementing agencies was conducted. (The following reports on GARFUND
Implementing Entities Needs Assessment are available for study:

       1.   A Rapid Appraisal of Implementation Status of the HIV/AIDS Sector
            Plans by MDAs ­ conducted by GAC, ActionAid SIPAA Project, July
            2003.
       2.   Strategic Framework for Supporting and Building the Capacity of CSOs,
            NGOs, FBOs, CBOs Implementing HIV/AIDS Programmes in Ghana ­
            conducted by GAC, ActionAid SIPAA Project, August 2003.

·      p. 14, para. 3.8: Statement that (a) `it is not clear to what extent and on what
basis best practices were determined and how effectively and often they were
disseminated"; is incorrect.

i.     There is evidence to show that best practices were shared and disseminated to
groups during workshops and conferences, e.g. National HIV/AIDS Research
Conference (NHARCON) and M & E conferences.

ii.    No matter what dissemination is done, one cannot get all respondents to indicate
positive change in attitudes.

·      p.14, para. 3.8 Statement that (b) `field interviews reveal a strong, unmet
demand for technical advice, guidance and support of relevant operational research.'

 i.    Statement must be supported with facts.

ii.    Under GARFUND support for operational research could be applied for.

·      p. 14, para 3.10: Statement that "One crucial position, Director of Technical
Services was never filled".

It is acknowledged that the position was not filled but for the following reasons:

i.     attempt made to recruit in 2002 did not succeed in getting a suitable person for
the position; none of the candidates interviewed was successful.

                                                           75


ii.   consequently, and as NACP already existed as a key partner and to avoid
duplication of functions, a deliberate policy decision was taken by he Commission to
utilize its technical services.

·     p.14, para. 3.11: Statements in the paragraph are mixed up. They should be
corrected as follows:
The Commission met regularly thrice a year to review progress towards the
implementation of Ghana's Strategic Framework. The GAC Project Review and
Appraisal Committee (PRAC) (whose membership was made public and rotated once
every two years) met twice a year to review and recommend to the GAC financing of
subproject proposals.....................

·     p. 15, para. 3.14: Financial Management8

i.    It is incorrect that duplication of payment and relatively large sums were
transferred from sub-project account to CBO accounts. CBOs accounts are the same
as sub project accounts. It is, therefore, unclear as to which sub projects transfers
were made to CBO accounts as the Report states.

ii.   Statement that ".......some NGOs proposals were funded without a budget.....".
All proposals that were submitted included budgets otherwise they would not qualify
to be evaluated. The statement should, therefore, be corrected.

iii.   Statement that "CBOs made changes in signatories to bank accounts without
GAC prior approval........" This is an outcome of an external audit. It should be
acknowledged that audits normally would reveal some deficiencies in systems and
procedures that need to be corrected and not a flawless situation.

iv.   It is acknowledged that at the time of the evaluation, funds granted to
Parliamentarians had not been fully accounted for. GAC Management had made
several efforts including seeking the intervention of the leadership of Parliament to
get the accounting done and there has been considerable improvement in the situation
as at now. It is unfortunate that the Evaluators did not enquire from GAC
Management to obtain such information for their report. As at date, 105 out of 158
Parliamentarians had accounted for funds granted.

·     p. 16, para. 3.16: Disbursements

It is inaccurate to suggest that delays were due to the steep learning curve of GAC
Secretariat. Delays in releasing tranches were the result of the World Bank's
requirement that reports on disbursed funds by NGOs/CBOs should be evaluated by
external groups before any further releases. That is not a steep learning curve but
World Banks' own engineered bottlenecks in disbursements.




8Weaknesses in financial management were cited in an audit of 75 CBOs financed under Window C (Ernst and Young, 2003).

4.      Monitoring and Evaluation

·     p. 18, para. 4.4, "Roles and responsibilities for M/E were not clearly articulated
in the project design document"......Incentives for evidence-based implementation (as
opposed to disbursement-based) implementation were absent from GARFUND's M &
E Plan.

i.    Statements should be clarified.

ii.    Roles and responsibilities for entities such as DACs, RACs, M/E focal persons
etc were defined under GARFUND as in the Operational Manual and the M & E
Framework 2001-2005.

·     page 18, 4.5: Statement that: `Development partners noted that throughout the
life of GARFUND, GAC's M & E plan for the NSF was not operational and their
dialogue with GAC to strengthen and operationalize it became a source of tension.
Respondents were emphatic that M & E seemed more a concern of the partners
outside of the project than of the Bank or GAC.'        This observation is untrue and
judgemental.

i.    Did the evaluators deem it significant to talk to other stakeholders apart from
development partners? We need evidence of the so called tension which in our view
is non-existent.

ii.   The operationalisation of the M & E plan was first raised by GAC at a meeting
of the Research, Monitoring & Evaluation technical committee. GAC served as a
catalyst in proactively steering the process for the development of M & E Framework
2001 ­ 2005, Annual M & E Report 2002 etc.

·     p. 19, para 4.7 contradicts p. 13, para 3.7 viz. `Considerable amount of training
and workshops were financed....' There is a discrepancy.

Statement that: `while the institutional and organizational framework and staffing for
M&E envisaged under the national M&E plan were clear, implementing agencies did
not have the proper training or tools for setting targets and measuring their
outcomes' is invalid for the following reasons:

i.    The Support to the International Partnership Against AIDS in Africa (SIPAA)
project between 2002 and 2005 provided support to GAC. The main target of the
SIPAA project during this period were capacity building of implementing partners of
GAC including District Focal Persons.

ii.   During the period of the project a comprehensive capacity building programme
was developed and implemented in Proposal Development, Project Management,
Financial Management, Counseling and Care for HIV, Peer Counseling and
Advocacy, HIV Competency among others.

                                                               77


iii.    Manuals developed for project management training covered issues of target
setting and measuring of project outcomes among others.

iv.     In 2002 and 2003 a total of 406 implementing partners benefited from training
on project management. These were not captured during the assessment as funding
was not drawn from GARFUND.

v.        At the district level, a total of 327 GARFUND beneficiary organizations
benefited project management training.

·       p. 19, para. 4.8. Statement that: Key information was not collected and thus
could not be used for decision-making. More fundamentally, the incentives to collect
and analyze data to improve program, project impact were weak. This is incorrect. A
significant number of end of project data on the indicators was available in cases
where surveys, sentinel surveillance etc had been completed.

5.         Outputs and Outcomes by Objective

·          para 5.3, p 22: Statement that "Expenditure on high transmission groups and
other groups specified in NSF and in the GARFUND design documents as high
priority is extremely low at barely 1 % of total expenditures for 2003".

i.      The high transmission groups were part of the general population and were
 reached by some NGOs and WAPCAS with direct funding from CIDA.9

ii.     issue of high-risk groups was not prominent in the original project design and of
 global focus.10

·       para. 5.6, p. 23: Statement that " "Subprojects with condom promotion and
distribution were small in scale and irregular........'

The project design did not allow for procurement of condoms. GAC could, therefore,
not promote it as should have been the case.11

·       p. 25, para 5.8: paragraph is untrue. Line 27 `District level actors noted that
while GAC approval of NGO subprojects was contingent on endorsement by the
district, in actual fact districts were encouraged to dispatch proposals immediately to
GAC for their rapid approval without reviewing and commenting on them' This is
absolutely incorrect.




9These sources of financing are included in the 1 percent (National HIV/AIDS Accounts, 2005).
10 Both Ghana's National Strategic Framework for HIV/AIDS (2001-2005) and the GARFUND design document (World Bank
2000b) specified the targeting of high-risk/high-transmission groups as an important element of prevention, in addition to
interventions aimed at the general population and vulnerable groups therein.
11 Included among the eligible activities for GARFUND financing are: interventions targeting high-risk groups to encourage
low-risk behavior; and condom distribution (World Bank 2000b).

                                             78


i.    Proposals have always been evaluated by independent evaluators and not GAC
staff.

ii.   District AIDS Committees reviewed and recommended proposals for funding
during the 3rd and 4th calls but not the 1st and 2nd calls when GAC did that through the
independent evaluators as capacity at the district level during the initial calls was
totally lacking.

·     p. 25, para 5.9:

i.    District M & E Focal Persons have been given training on best practices in the
production of IEC materials including bill boards.

ii.   The BCC strategy which was widely disseminated provides a blueprint for
targeted IEC and BCC materials production.

iii.  Training was given to the focal persons but the turnover as a result of frequent
transfers of trained Focal Persons affected the capacity of new ones to deliver.

·     p. 27, para 5.13:

i.    The observation in this paragraph is rather strange. Where in the world has
"fear, stigmatization and discrimination" been completely dealt with.

ii.   There has been significant change in the attitudes of the general public.

iii.  It is unfair to make a conclusion on only one (1) reported case of fear and
stigma. It is a fallacy of hasty generalisation.

6.      Ratings

·     p. 31, para 6.4: Many of the observations in the paragraph are incorrect.

i.    It is not true that MOH was excluded from GARFUND because of the mandate
of GAC. MOH was given finance to undertake its HIV/AIDS activities. In addition
GARFUND financed MOH in a number of ways. Finances were made available to
Ghana Medical Association, Nurses Association, Pharmacy Association, Laboratory
Technicians all within MOH for intervention activities.

ii.   Statement that: "Over and above the exclusion of MOH activities from
GARFUND financing, the organizational structure and mandate of GAC and the
GAC Secretariat reduce the role of the MOH, curtailing its potential to provide
needed technical guidance............" is ambiguous.

iii.  In what respect did the mandate of the GAC reduce the role of the MOH? We
do not find GAC's mandate to be in conflict with the role of MOH. If MOH did not
have the opportunity to provide technical guidance as the Evaluators believe it might

                                                           79


be due to MOH's own staffing and logistical problems rather than an undefined role
for it under the GARFUND by GAC.

iv.    In one breadth the Evaluators found the establishment of the position of
Technical Director within the set up of the Secretariat appropriate and even goes on
incessantly to lament the fact that it was never filled and, therefore, technical
guidance of implementing agencies was inadequate. At the same time they expected
the MOH to have provided the ".....needed technical guidance .........". If the
Technical Director was recruited and MOH was to undertake this function wouldn't
that have been tantamount to duplication of functions, which was one of the
unintended reasons why the position was not filled?

v.     Decentralization efforts were rather enhanced by GARFUND arrangement. It is
not correct to say that GARFUND arrangement whereby NGOs and FBOs were
centrally contracted affected their accountability to RAC's.

vi.    It is incorrect to state that the Secretariat devoted itself almost exclusively to the
Role of PIU for the Bank. GAC was not created as project management
unit (PIU) and therefore did consider itself as such. GAC was created by an Act of
Parliament 613 and therefore its functions were enshrined in the Act. These were
what GAC facilitated to get the national response on track.

vii. It is also incorrect that Non-health public sector agencies financed under
Garfund failed to budget for counterpart funds for their HIV/AIDS plans. GAC
required that Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) demonstrated evidence
of payment of their own counterpart contribution to Garfund sub project before funds
were released to the agencies. This was the reason why most MDAs failed to access
the Garfund because the payment of counterpart funding was a problem. So all those
non-health public sector agencies that accessed the GARFUND indeed paid up their
contributions in cash as their commitment. The evaluators got it all wrong.

·      p. 32, para 6.7. The true picture is not presented here.

i.     At the beginning of GARFUND, awareness was not universal. It is incredible
  for anyone to say that awareness was universal at the onset of the project. If that
  was the case the project would not have had an objective of increasing awareness.12

ii.    Ghana should be given the credit for enormous work done to achieve universal
  awareness within three years of GARFUND.

iii.   Targeting high risk regions, high risk behaviours and places of high risk activity
  became an issue at the tail end of the project.

·      p. 32, para 6.8, last sentence.



12HIV/AIDS awareness was already universal at the start of GARFUND. In 2003, the first full year of GARFUND
implementation, 98 percent of women and 99 percent of men were aware of HIV/AIDS.

GHANET was fully supported. GAC through its SIPAA projects provided funds to
GHANET to establish its secretariat and provided enough funds to NGOs for their
activities. What is the evidence that GHANET was not supported?

·     p. 36, Box 4: Role of MOH:

i.    Totally wrong information is presented on GAC and MOH.13

ii.   It is incorrect to say that MOH was not given any special status on the
Commission.

iii.  The MOH is represented on the Commission by two (2) key officials of MOH,
namely the Minister of Health and the Programme Manager of NACP.

iv.   Both serve on the Steering Committee of GAC; the Minister is the Chairman of
the Care and Support Committee and the Programme Manager serves on the
Prevention & Care Committee. NACP staff also serve on the GAC Research,
Monitoring and Evaluation Committee. What other special status could have been
given the MOH?

v.    The decision even not to recruit the Technical Director after the initial effort had
failed, was partly due to the recognition GAC gave to need to utilize the technical
services of the NACP/MOH.

vi.   GAC did not take over IEC responsibility from MOH. This is totally wrong.

vii. The whole content of Box 4 is misinformation and should be removed.

·     Comment on Overall Rating

On the basis of the foregoing comments, GAC's position is that: We do not accept the
rating of Unsatisfactory on the Outcome and Overall Project. We believe they are
both Satisfactory as the Implementation Completion Report assessed.




13IEG notes that this information is from Act 613 of Parliament of January 2002, creating GAC.

ANNEX H-2 ­ Comments of the President's Office on Draft GARFUND (Cr
3458-GH) Project Performance Assessment Report

Submitted by Dr. Fred Sai, Special Adviser to the President on HIV/AIDS


           I am yet to have a satisfactory reason as to why the assessors found it
impossible to contact me during their visit to Ghana.1 A project of this type always
has political, administrative and legal dimensions which should have considerable
weight in comprehensive assessment. It is not clear if the assessors really appreciated
the roles of the Ghana AIDS Commission and its technical committees. They
obviously did not appreciate the fact that a Commission of this nature cannot
undertake the work needed for approving proposals. As the person with direct
political and administrative oversight, on behalf of the President, a good interview
with me should have been a must for any evaluation. Although I had no part in the
development of the project I played a major role in the establishment of the secretariat
and the reconstitution of the Commission itself.

           The Commission decided at the beginning of GARFUND that the Ghana
epidemic was already generalized enough for a very broad education campaign aimed
first and foremost to prevent the over 96% of the population, not infected, from
getting infected. Secondly to provide care, support etc. for those infected and
affected. Special risk groups such as female sex workers and men having sex with
men received attention from specific NGOs, and rather quietly, since the current laws
of Ghana have to be respected. In fact efforts have been made to get the police to be
gentler in the interpretation of the laws and for the judiciary to respect the human
rights of those who come to court. Whilst these are going on, flagrant challenges will
not help.2

           It must also be pointed out that the GAC could not fund activities which
included condom purchase and distribution because the donors were against the GAC
being involved in those.3 The assessors would have been told this if only they had
cared to involve the GAC staff much more closely in their work
I find the approach to the assessment rather strange. How did the assessors validate
the information they received from those they interviewed.4 Some of the NGO and
MDA representatives have gripes and knowledge gaps which could be profound. A
senior representative of a ministry, for example, came to a business meeting of the
partners to ask why the ministry was not being supported by GAC. In fact the
particular ministry was being supported and had reported on the very good work


1IEG notes that it was unable to meet with Dr. Sai while in Ghana due to the mission's travel to the interior and Dr. Sai's
unavailability. He was reached by phone upon the mission's return to Washington, but preferred to participate by sending
comments on the draft report.
2Both Ghana's National Strategic Framework (2001-2005) and the design document specified the need for more interventions
aimed at high-risk, high-transmission groups, as a complement to interventions aimed at the general population and vulnerable
groups therein.
3IEG notes that the GARFUND design document specifies behavior change interventions, including condom purchase and
distribution, among the activities eligible for financing (World Bank 2000b).
4IEG notes that it triangulates evidence across many sources: interviews, direct field observation and review of relevant
documents, and research.

being done to the Commission in full session. Some of the donor representatives have
their "pet priorities" and I wonder how the assessors managed to separate objective
views from biased opinions.5 Pressure to do more work with sex workers and men
having sex with men is one such problem issue. There was an occasion when an
important donor representative even queried the priority being given to youth.
At times I could not help feeling that the assessors were not judging by the state of
knowledge and practice at the time the project was developed but by what is going on
currently. The section on incidence and tracking of the epidemic is a case in point.
Nobody in this field or any other medical area would use prevalence only to track an
epidemic. The sentinel survey had been well conducted in Ghana. The age range,
being used by many as proxy for incidence, is showing a good trend. The DHS is
scheduled to be repeated next year. Between the 2003 and the 2008 findings we will
get some dependable information of nation-wide relevance. I cannot therefore see any
justification for spending money and resources on other surveys at this time.
I am the first to admit that the Evaluation work done by the GAC is not doing them
credit. A lot of data exist but these have not been collated and worked to produce
usable information. This is already being addressed.

           It is not clear if the assessors appreciated the intra-MOH problem of
relationships between the MOH and the Ghana Health Service (GHS); nor how these
relate to the decentralized administration being pursued by the Ghana Government. I
am almost certain that a chat with me and the Manager of the NACP6 would have
been of use in appreciating how closely the GAC and the NACP had been working
together. The GAC has been trying, for the purpose of sustainability, to work through
the district administration. The absence of a technical director is not the sole or even
the main source of any perceived lack of collaboration with the MOH. It is unfair to
give the impression that the post of technical director did not receive proper attention.
The first round of interviews for the post was attended by several well qualified
individuals. The one selected was receiving better pay from a donor so he turned
down the offer. Practically all the others were better off in the Government service.
Efforts to get a joint appointment with the GHS were not successful. In fact just this
week another set of interviews have been conducted. Out of five candidates short-
listed only two turned up. One was completely below standard. The one being
considered for appointment now did not have the number of years post-qualification
experience required but it was agreed that that individual had enough specialized
experience to make up for this. Hopefully he will accept an offer.
I would like to make it clear too that the project was developed before the secretariat
was completely established. Practically all concerned with its development
disappeared before implementation.

           The overall unsatisfactory rating of this project disturbs me greatly. Despite
what the assessors say about awareness surely everyone knows that there is a
difference between being aware of something and knowing what it means or its
implications. Thanks to a strong media practically all Ghanaians heard of HIV/AIDS


5Objectives-based evaluation methodology assessed performance against targets and objectives established in Ghana's National
Strategic Framework for HIV/AIDS (2001-2005) and in the project document.

almost as soon as the first cases were identified in the country. But what did they
know about it? This is what the project tackled so well.7 To expect massive behavior
change in a three year life of a project seems to me to be overoptimistic. Right now
one of the most troublesome areas is how to get health staff working closely with
HIV to make it clear by their body language and behavior that the infection is not
easy to catch.

         Although one cannot prove that the favorable trend changes in the Ghana
epidemic are attributable solely or even mainly to the work don with the GARFUND,
it cannot be proved that it has made no contribution either. To me an unsatisfactory
rating means the Ghana situation has changed for the better despite GARFUND.
How can such a conclusion be justified? The GAC staff is submitting its considered
views on specific items in the report.
