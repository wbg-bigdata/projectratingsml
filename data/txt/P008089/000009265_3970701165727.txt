PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO - THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1722-TR)
PREFACE
The Third Education Project in Trinidad and Tobago was partly
financed under Loan 1722-TR (US$20 million) and was signed on July 13, 1979.
The project was never fully implemented and was allowed to lapse on its
original closing date (December 31, 1983) with 91% of the loan (US$18.2
million) cancelled.
This project completion report (PCR) was prepared by a mission that
visited Trinidad and Tobago in February 1985. Since the project was never
fully implemented, this PCR focuses on identification of the possible causes
for the less than successful implementation and draws some useful lessons.
The PCR is based on: (a) discussions with high level officials of Trinidad
and Tobago; (b) the findings of the mission; (c) the outline completion
report prepared by the Borrower's Educational F cilities Management Unit
(EFMU); and (d) data from Bank files, including Board Resolution No. 79-76
dated June 7, 1979, the Loan Agreement and related legal documents, the
President's Report No. P-2566-TR of May 22, 1979 and the Staff Appraisal
Report No. 2430b-TR of May 21, 1979.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
reporting, this project completion report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and its agencies in September 1985.
The comments received have been taken into account in finalizing the report
and are reproduced as Attachment I.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO - THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1722-TR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The Third Education Project (Loan 1722-TR in the amount of US$20
million) was prepared by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago with the
assistance of UNESCO, and was appraised in November 1978 (Appraisal Report
No. 2430b-TR dated May 21, 1979). The loan was processed expeditiously and
was approved six months after the return of the appraisal mission. The Loan
Agreement was signed one month later on July 13, 1979 and became effective on
August 29, 1980. Total project costs were estimated at US$54.6 million. In
the event the project was never fully implemented and the loan was allowed to
lapse on its original Closing Date (December 31, 1983) when the US$18.2
million remaining in the loan account was cancelled.
Objectives
The project was to (para. 2.02);
(a) help the Government expand access to schooling and equalize
educational opportunity by providing: (i) 27 replacement primary
schools; (ii) 2 junior secondary schools; and (iii) extensions for
6 senior and 2 composite (junior/senior) secondary schools;
(b) improve the quality and relevance of education by establishing a
National Curriculum and Teacher Development Center and a Regional
Teacher Development Center; and
(c)  assist the Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC) in creating a
permanent and efficient school construction and management unit by
establishing an Education Facilities Management Unit (EFMU).
Implementation Experience
The project was intended to end a long period of strained relations
between the Bank and the Government of Trinidad and Tobago. This considera-
tion led to the Bank's effort to hasten the processing of the loan, and to
the relaxation of some of the Bank's normal criteria (para. 3.02). In retro-
spect, the scope and complexity of this project imposed heavier demands on
the Borrower's management capabilities than it could provide at the time
(para. 3.04). The lack of advanced and thorough preparation of the project
decreased the likelihood that the project would be successful before imple-
mentation was even attempted (para. 3.05). The project was finally abandoned
by the Government because of its inability to adjust the project scope in
order to redress a financing gap created by high inflation rates (especially



- vi -
in the construction industry) (para. 3.07), and exacerbated by a thirteen-
month delay in achieving loan effectiveness (para. 4.03) and underestimation
of project costs and price contingencies (para. 3.06). This delay doubled
estimated project costs before implementation had even begun. Total esti-
mated project costs finally rose to about 350% of the original estimate. The
combined effects of the substantial project cost overrun and deteriorating
economic conditions in Trinidad and Tobago confronted the Government with a
policy dilemma which, in the end, it was unable to resolve, despite the
urgent need to revise the project scope (para. 4.08).
Results
Of a total of 39 project institutions originally envisioned, only
two extensions to composite secondary schools were actually completed (para.
5.01). The project achieved limited success: (i) in institution building
aspects (establishment of EFMU and training programs for teachers of agricul-
ture and guidance/counselling) (para. 5.02); and (ii) in sensitizing the
Government to revise its policies with respect to access to secondary educa-
tion, the importance of curriculum and teacher development, and realistic
class sizes and construction standards (paras. 5.06 and 5.07).
Sustainabil ity
Most of the physical facilities originally included in the project
were not provided, so the question of the sustainability of the benefits they
would have conferred does not arise. The project had some limited success in
its institution-building aspects and these, though difficult to quantify, are
likely to have long-term impact.
Findings and Lessons
The unusual circumstances and implementation experience of this
project provide some useful lessons to Bank staff:
(a) Although approval of this project was accomplished expeditiously in
order to improve relations with Trinidad and Tobago, Bank/country
relations would have benefited from a more deliberate and critical
approach to project preparation (para. 6.02).
(b)  During project generation and preparation, the Bank should place
emphasis on evaluating the borrower's capacity to implement the
proposed project with respect to its scope and complexity. The
simple provision of project management consultants is not
sufficient, but must be calibrated to a borrower's own management
capacity (para. 6.03).
(c) The Bank needs to devise effective guidelines for dealing with
unusually large contingencies in volatile economies. The reasoning
behind contingency estimates formulated should be clearly
documented. When estimated price contingencies are found to be
excessive, the Bank should limit the size of the appraised project,
or break the project into phases which would be separately approved
(para. 6.04).



- vii -
(d) the Bank should act early and decisively once it has detected a
borrower's lack of diligence in project implementation. In cases
where implementation is clearly hopeless, the Bank should look for
a way to cancel the loan without having to wait for the closing
date or trying to persuade the borrower to request a cancellation
(para. 6.05).



I. Socioeconomic Setting
1.01      The economic outlook in Trinidad and Tobago changed considerably
beLween the time that the Third Education Project was prepared and the time
that it was scheduled to be completed. The evolution of economic conditions
and public policy from the late 1960s to the present have significantly
shaped the overall development of the entire education sector, and
new policies needed to address fiscal and balance of payment problems
particularly affected the implementation of the Third Education Project.
1.02      The oil price hike in 1974 had a dramatic effect on economic
performance in the 1970s. Economic growth and fiscal and monetary
performance strengthened, and large gains were seen in both consumption and
investment. Public current and capital expenditures increased dramatically
during this period, and public investment projects in most sectors of the
economy multiplied until they reached 70 percent of total investment and 20%
of GDP.
1.03      At the time the Third Education Project was prepared (i.e. around
1978), the production of crude oil and the growth of the oil-dependent
Trinidadian economy peaked. As a result of the rapid increase in public
investment, significant problems arose in the management of government
projects, including the lack of reliable estimates of costs, benefits,
phasing, and current expenditure implications of the projects. Significant
cost overruns and delays were common among projects undertaken in the late
1970s, even in the Government's priority energy and heavy-industry projects.
1.04      By 1982, the decline in the price of petroleum and the gradual
decrease in the domestic production of oil brought about real decreases in
public sector revenues and slower economic growth.   The fall in export
earnings and thus in government revenues led to a marked deterioration in the
fiscal position of the country in 1982 in face of the Government's continuing
commitment to oil generated expenditures. Because of the projected
continuous decline in petroleum revenues, the Government in the 1980s could
not expect to increase expenditures at the same pace as it had in the late
1970s.
II. Project Objectives and Content
2.01      The Third Education Project was designed to support the third phase
of the Government's Education Development Plan (1967-1982) and to contribute
specifically to institution building, the equalization of educational
opportunity, and the provision of relevant education of high quality in
Trinidad and Tobago.
2.02      The project proposed to:
(1) Construct, furnish and equip:
(a) replacements for about 27 dilapidated denominational primary
schools (9,320 student places);
(b) two new junior secondary schools (2,880 places);



- 2 -
(c) extensions to 6 senior and 2 composite secondary schools (1,320
student places);
(2) Establish the National Curriculum and Teacher Development Center
(NCTDC) and the Regional Teacher Development Center (RTDC) to build
permanent procedures for curriculum development, teacher education,
and the production of teaching/learning materials;
(3) Initiate training courses for agricultural teachers at the Eastern
Caribbean Institute of Agriculture and Forestry; and
(4)  Strengthen the Ministry of Education and Culture (NEC) by
establishing the Educational Facilities Management Unit (EFMU) and
by providing technical assistance (10 staffyears of specialist
services and 9.25 staffyears of fellowships) and specialist
services for project management and administration (10 staff
years).
III. Project Generation and Preparation
A.   Introduction
3.01      The Third Education Project was intended to end a long period of
strained relations between the Bank and Trinidad and Tobago. By accelerating
approval of a third project, the Bank hoped not only to improve relations
with Trinidad and Tobago, but also to encourage the Government to accept a
leading role in the development of the Caribbean Region.
3.02       The Bank's effort to expedite Board presentation of the Third
Education Project resulted in the lack of thorough preparation of the
project, particularly the misjudgement of the borrower's technical and
managerial capacity to implement the project, and thus led to its
unsuccessful implementation. Inadequate preparation of the project also
resulted in the failure to adequately define site requirements and
appropriate price contingencies, which aggravated the effects of the Bank's
misjudgment of the borrower's managerial capacity.
B. Misjudgment of Borrower's Management Capacity
3.03      The design of the Third Education Project (with a loan amount of
US$20 million) was more ambitious than that of the First and Second Projects
(with loan amounts of $9.2 and $9.3 million respectively). The Loan Request
Document prepared by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago with the
assistance of UNESCO noted that, 'The proposed Third World Bank Educational
Loan Project is of unprecedented magnitude in terms of the number of
sub-projects involved and also in respect of variety...Hence it will be
advisable to strengthen the staff of the (Project Implementation) Unit at the
upper level. The Staff Appraisal Report (May 21, 1979) also noted that



"Crucial to the construction program is the early selection er- appointment
of the expatriate project management group." At the time the project was
presented to the Board, Bank staff acknowledged that the project faced the
risk of delay in the engagement of the project management team (PMT) ("Loan
and Project Summary" of the President Report). In order to hasten approval
of the project, however, the Bank allowed the contracting of the PMT (as well
as the staffing of the PIU) to be met by effectiveness rather than Board
presentation as recommended by the appraisal mission, and made no adequate
pLOvl'ion for countervailing the risks other than sending a Bank mission to
assist the borrower in drawirg up the terms of reference for a project
management team.
3.04      Since the success of th: Third Education Project strongly depended
on the existence of qualified local implementation authorities and expatriate
advisors, and since the mDre limited Second Education Project experienced
difficulties in attracting and keeping PIU staff, it seems that the staffing
of the EFMU and the contracting of the PMT should have been prime concerns of
the project, and thus that these conditions should have been met before Board
presentation even if this would have postponed approval of the project.   The
Bank staff believed that provision of a P1tT would solve the management
problems experienced in the first two education projects. The use of
external management consultants was not, however, effective since the
Government's own management capability was misjudged. In retrospect, the
project should have been much smaller and simpler if adequate measures to
strengthen the borrower's managerial capacity were not identified at
appraisal. Since the Third Education Project was much larger than either of
the first two projects implemented in Trinidad and Tobago, the preparation of
the project should have been exceptionally thorough rather than cursory
(paras. 3.05, 3.06).
C. Postponed Site Selection
3.05      Some of the critical planning for project implementation was not
completed before Board presention. During appraisal, the exact requirements
for only 9 of the 15 identified primary schools were specified (i.e. location
and size of each school). It was assumed that the other six schools and the
12 schools yet to be identified would be built on the sites of the old
substandard schools they were to replace. When this proved to be impossible,
finding suitable sites became a problem. Site acquisition and the execution
of topographic surveys were also delayed because of a shortage of land
surveyors in the country. Because these considerations were not identified
at appraisal, the borrower was not able to budget for site acquisition and
other costs until well into implementation when economic constraints were
already being felt.
D. Underestimation of Price Contingencies
3.06      The tremendous funding gap, which finally caused the project to be
abandoned by the Government, was partially created at appraisal. The Bank
considered the Loan Request Document contingency estimates excessive, and
reduced them significantly. In hindsight, this judgement was unsound since



-4 -
it neglected factors which subsequently led to high inflation in Trinidad and
Tobago, particularly the high level of Government investment expenditures
(para. 1.02). The following table compares the estimated price contingencies
in the Request Document and the SAR:
Price Contingencies (1)
Civil   Furniture  Equipment  Technical  Average
Works                          Assistance
SAR                38.2     33.0        19.5       12.0        34.0
Request Doc.      101.0     55.0        55.0       50.0        88.5
ZSAR/Request       37.8     60.0        35.5       24.0        38.4
3.07      Excess demand in the construction industry resulted in shortages of
skilled labor and materials (cement and concrete in particular) and allowed
contractors LO impose inflated construction prices (Annexes 1 and 2). Unit
prices for some of the main building trades in Trinidad and Tobago show
increases of between 168% and 302% for the period 1979 to 1981. Actual
construction costs per square foot for the two composite schools, based on
the final amounts paid to contractors, show increases on the order of 246%
and 299% respectively compared to the appraisal estimate of 38.2 percent (see
Annexes 3 and 4). 1/ The SAR (May 21, 1979) noted that the construction
industry in Trinidad and Tobago was under considerable strain and presented a
risk to successful project implementation. It stated, though, that "the
Government has launched a program to expand local cement production,
facilitate the availability of building materials, and encourage civil works
bids from non-national contractors." These measures, however, never entirely
materialized and were not sufficient to relieve the considerable strain on
the c3nstruction industry. The higher price contingencies originally
estimated by Trinidad and Tobago and UNESCO during project preparation would
have been more appropriate than those adopted by the Bank. The
underestimation of price contingencies greatly reduced the potential
contribution of the loarn amount and increased above estimates the counterpart
funds needed to sustain the project.
IV. Project Implementation
A. Introduction
4.01      The implementation achievements of this project consist mainly of
extensions built to two composite secondary schools and a limited technical
1/   In dollars, cost overruns could have been smaller had the exchange
rate been adjusted for the difference in the rates of local and
foreign inflation. Instead, the exchange rate was constant throughout
the project implementation period despite the sharp difference between
local and foreign inflation rates.



-5-
assistance component. The failure to complete the rest of the project is
attributed to the Bank's misjudgement of the local management capacity
(para. 3.04). During the implementation period, the Government's limited
management capabilities were evidenced by: (1) inadequate staffing of the
PIU; (2) changes in Government education standards; (3) disputed procurement
procedures; and (4) incomplete and delayed communication with the Bank.
Management problems which impeded successful implementation of the project
were exacerbated by a delay in reaching loan effectiveness, and by changes in
political and economic conditions in Trinidad and Tobago which delayed
Government decisions on the reformulation of project scope.
B. Delayed Loan Effectiveness
4.02      The loan actually became effective on August 29, 1980, 13 months
after signing instead of the 3 months originally foreseen. Compliance with a
condition for effectiveness, (i.e. the contracting of consultants for the PMT
who were to assist the EFMU), caused this 13 month delay because the contract
proposal of the first firm selected to provide these services, which was
prepared using expected inflation rates, had to be rejected as excessive in
the final negotiation stage since the Government negotiated on the basis of
appraisal costs which stipulated fixed contract prices. Another firm had to
be selected, and the negotiation process recommenced. In retrospect, the
Bank should have originally suggested adjustable prices in view of conditions
prevailing in Trinidad and Tobago, although Bank policy usually adheres to
fixed, lump-sum contracts.
4.03      In October 1980, two months after loan effectiveness, project costs
had already risen from the appraised TT$131 million to TT$337 million (a 157
percent increase). This enormous increase in project costs created by the
delay in reaching effectiveness exacerbated the original financial
miscalculations and increased the financing gap faced by the Government of
Trinidad and Tobago.
C. Inadequate Staffing of the Project Implementation Unit
4.04      A staffing problem continued over the entire implementation period,
delaying implementation that actually took place. Although the PMT/EFMU
eventually operated at full capacity, there were difficulties in recruiting
sufficiently qualified local staff, because the low salary levels and the
temporary nature of the posts militated against the recruitment of
personnel. Full staffing of EFMU was not accomplished until the PMT contract
was near expiration, so that the counterpart training envisioned at appraisal
could not be adequately carried out.
4.05      The rapid turnover of the staff of the EFMU adversely affected the
implementation of the project and the unit's ability to efficiently
incorporate the training offered by the expatriate PMT.  The fact that EFMU
hae responsibility for several projects in addition to the Third Education
Project also adversely affected implementation. During the time that the
Third Education Project was to be implemented, the EFMU also had
responsibility for, inter alia: (1) the upgrading of denominational secondary



- 6 -
schools in accordance with the National Model; (2) extensions to several
government assisted primary schools; and (3) completion of the Short-Term
School Building Programme comprising 12 non-project secondary schools. In
view of the fact that the Second Education Project also suffered from
problems in recruiting and maintaining PIU staff, and from under-staffing due
to the PIU's responsibility for several projects, it seems that more adequate
measures designed to address the local staffing problem should have been
identified during project preparation, and corrective measures taken before
the project was presented to the Board.
D. Changes in Government Education Standards
4.06      In 1980, the Ministry of Education revised several fundamental
educational standards contrary to Bank advice, presumably to reflect Trinidad
and Tobago's improved economic outlook. Primary class size was reduced from
40 to 25 students. The new secondary schools to be built under the project
were upgraded to offer five year programs rather than the traditional three
year programs. Specifications were raised so that school buildings would:
(a) have a minimum life span of 50 years; (b) use more expensive materials in
order to reduce maintenance and repair costs; and (c) be designed with
collapsible partitions between classrooms.
4.07      These increased standards, although not devoid of benefits, had the
effect of increasing the average net and gross school building areas by 27.8Z
and 37.3% respectively above those set out in the working papers (Annexes 5
and 6). The increases in school building areas and the upgrading of the
norms for educational facilities to ,ether raised the base cost of the project
by 60 percent. The need to redesign elements of the project due to the change
in educational policy also led to delays which exacerbated the increased
project costs due to inflation. The Bank advised against drastic changes and
pointed out that the proposed modifications would increase both capital and
recurrent costs. The Government was, however, confident that it could absorb
the additional cost, and proceeded with the preparation of architectural
designs incorporating the upgraded standards. Later, when economic
constraints were beginning to be felt, the Government had to decrease the
scope of the project and lower educational standards for facilities. Designs
and construction specifications had to be redone, causing delays in physical
implementation. Even after the tendering for constructon of primary schools,
the Ministry of Finance did not apnrove recommendations for award on the
grounds that educational norms and construction standards were still too
high, so no primary schools were rebuilt by the project.
E. Indecision on Adjustment of Project Scope
4.08      Further delays in project implementation were caused when the
Cabinet ordered substantial revisions in project content (see Annex 7).
By May 1981, project costs had increased by approximately 200 percent to
TT$380 million. Due to this dramatic increase in project costs, Cabinet
requested (August 1981) the MEC to prepare a reappraisal of the project. The
reappraisal prepared recommended the retention of virtually all of the
original project components, and was approved by the February 1982 Bank



- 7 -
mission. Because of the death of the Prime Minister (March 1981), the
consequent reshuffling of the Cabinet, and the appointment of a new Minister
of Education, the reappraisal could not be considered by Cabinet until August
1982 although it was ready in late 1981. By this time (August 1982), the
cost of the project had risen to TT$451 million or about 350 percent of the
original estimate.
4.09       The Prime Minister's death had a significant bearing on the
subsequent indecision of the Government with regard to project scope. The
Prime Minister had exhibited a strong commitment to educational development
through his support of the Education Development Plan, and had spearheaded
the Government effort to launch the Third Education Project. His death left
a vacuum in the Cabinet which contributed to indecision on project
reformulation.
4.10      Because of continually escalating project costs and evolving
budgetary constraints, Cabinet requested that the MEC revise the project
twice from late 1982 to March 1983 in order to bring project costs closer to
the originally estimated TT$131 million. The final reduced project proposal
was approved by Cabinet on March 30, 1983 and communicated to the Bank
shortly thereafter. Costs were contained to the originally estimated TT$131
million by decreasing (from 27 to 15) the number of primary schools to be
rebuilt, by adding facilities for junior secondary students to an existing
secondary school instead of building two new junior secondary schools, and by
eliminating the proposed NCTDC, the RTDC and the craft extensions to six
senior secondary schools. Implementation of the reduced project was to take
place over a three-year period. The Bank was asked to extend the loan
closing date to December 1986 in view of Cabinet's decision to limit annual
expenditures on primary school construction to US$10 million.
4.11      The Bank indicated that the revised project was acceptable in
principle provided that certain qualitative components were reinstated. 2/
The Bank communicated to the Government its policy of only extending the
closing date of a loan one year at a time, and designated certain components
of the reduced project that had to be implemented by December 1983 in order
for the Bank to consider extending the loan to December 1984. In spite of
the Government's request to extend the loan closing date to December 1986,
the Bank also communicated its intention not to extend the closing date later
than December 31, 1985 in view of the continuing lack of progress in project
implementation. The Cabinet then deferred a decision on the proposal,
pending the report of a working party set up on September 29, 1983. This
decision to delay was not communicated to the Bank.
2/ The Bank proposed that the implementation of the NCDTC/RTDC be reinstated
in order to maintain the qualitative aspects of the project, and that the
extension of PMT services be reduced from 90 aIm to 36 m/m since almost
all of the preparatory work for project implementation had been completed
and extended PMT assistance in all aspects of implementation was therefore
unnecessary.



-8-
4.12      From May to December 1983, the Bank repeatedly tried to obtain a
final Government decision on the status of the project. As late as February
14, 1984, the Government informed the Bank that it was still "following up
the matter and would be in touch shortly.- On April 4, 1984, the Bank cabled
the Government requesting a reply by April 17. In the absence of a
Government communication, the Bank cancelled the undisbursed balance of the
loan (US$18,156,411.70) on May 31, 1984, and so informed the Government.
F.   Disputed Procurement Procedures
4.13      Of the 37 institutions to be built under this project, only 2
(extensions to existing schools) were actually completed. These were not
financed by the Bank due to the Government's noncompliance with the Bank's
procurement guidelines. This incident delayed implementation and contributed
to the financing gap since the Government entirely financed the construction
of these two schools.
4.14      On the premise that this construction was urgent, the Government
selected 3 firms from a list of 16 prequalified contractors, invited bids
from these 3 contractors (excluding the others), and awarded the contracts.
The Bank argued that this procedure: (a) resulted in bids that were not
competitive; (b) did not significantly reduce contracting and executing time;
and (c) that the criteria for selecting the three contractors were unclear.
Several institutions built under the Second Education Project were not
financed by the Bank due to the same disputed procurement procedures, so the
Borrower was undoubtedly aware that the bidding procedure used was not
compatible with Bank Guidelines.
G. Incomplete Communication between the Government and the Bank
4.15 Throughout the period when the loan was effective, communication
between the Bank and Trinidad and Tobago was incomplete and continually
delayed. Trinidad and Tobago was required to submit Quarterly Progress
Reports to the Bank so that issues could be handled speedily. Because of the
unexpected cost implications of the project, Cabinet approval was required
for each report. This procedure contributed to the slow decision-making of
the Government and caused inordinate delays since the Bank was not quickly
informed of issues which might have required immediate action.

- 10 -
B. Institution Building
5.02     Despite the meager physical achievements of the project, some
important institutional developments were attained (Annex 8).
5.03      Establishment of EFMU.  In compliance with Sections 3.02 and 3.03
of the Loan Agreement, the project established within the MEC the Educational
Facilities Management Unit which continues to serve in a variety of
construction, maintenance, and data gathering tasks. The expatriate PMT
partially succeeded in providing project management training for the EFMU
staff under difficult circumstances, and left behind a well-prepared handbook
on project administration.
5.04     Agricultural Teache-; Training.  As required by Section 3.05 of the
Loan Agreement, arrangements for the training of agricultural teachers have
been made at Mausica College, operating as a dr?endency of the Eastern
Caribbean Institute of Agriculture and Forestry. Twenty teachers were
trained in 1983-84 and are now in post. Another 20 teachers are currently
being trained.
5.05     Guidance and Counselling Services.  In accordance with Section 3.05
of the Loan Agreement, specialists contracted under the Loan Agreement
trained a total of 70 guidance counselors and teachers who are actively
engaged in the education sector.
5.06     Access to Junior Secondary Schools.  During the appraisal/
negotiation stages of project generation, the Bank urged the Government to
reconsider its plan of returning from multishifts to single shifts in the 21
Junior secondary schools, since these multiple shifts are designed to ensure
secondary school places for all qualified primary school graduates. In light
of the accumulated backlog of secondary school construction and the
deteriorating economic situation, the Government has decided to defer
indefinitely the proposed reduction of shifts in the existing junior
secondary schools.
5.07      Construction Standards and Class Sizes.  The Government has
realized that class size and construction standards need to be modified to
maximize cost effectiveness. Primary school classes have been increased in
size from 25 to 30, school designs have been simplified, and accommodations
have been limited to those that are strictly necessary.
VI. Lessons Learned
6.01       While a number of critical situations that arose during
implementation and contributed to the abandonment of the project could not
have been foreseen at appraisal - such as the economic downturn, the
decision to upgrade educational standards, and the death of the Prime
Minister, there are several areas from which the Bank might draw some useful
lessons.



- 11 -
Project Preparation and Country Relations
6.02      The Bank made an extraordinary effort to process this project
expeditiously in order to Improve its relations with Trinidad and Tobago.
This effort resulted in inadequate compliance with normal Bank standards on
technical preparation of a project and assessment of a borrower's management
capacity, and ultimately led to the failure of the project. Careful
project preparation and assessment of the borrower's management capacity
should be at an advanced stage before Board presentation. Replacing
conditions for Board presentation by conditions for loan effectiveness
accelerated approval of this project, but also unfortunately deferred
implementation problems to a later stage. Subsequent delays in reaching loan
effectiveness proved to be costly to the Government and thus impeded
implementaton progress. In the long run, the Bank's relations with Trinidad
and Tobago would have benefited from a more deliberate and critical approach
to project preparation.
Management Capacity of Borrower and Project Complexity
6.03      During project generation and preparation, the Bank should place
emphasis on evaluating the borrower's capacity to implement the proposed
project with respect to its scope and complexity.   The simple provision of
project management consultants is not sufficient if a borrower's own
management capacity is considerably weak. When a borrower's management
capacity is below minimum levels, the Bank should reduce the project scope
and apply a detailed institution strengthening strategy, or should formnlate
the project as an engineering type, preparation loan.
Price Contingencies
6.04      The Bank needs to devise effective guidelines for dealing with
price contingencies in volatile economic situations. When borrowers are not
accustomed to dealing with inflation, the Bank should explain the need for
price adjustment clauses in contracts. Price contingencies should be
carefully assessed during appraisal and the reasoning behind the estimates
formulated should be clearly documented. When estimated price contingencies
are found to be excessive, the Bank should limit the size of the appraised
project, or break the project into phases which would be separately
approved.
Loan Cancellation
6.05      In cases where implementation is clearly hopeless, the Bank should
look for a way to cancel the loan without having to wait for the closing date
or trying to persuade the borrower to request a cancellation. The Bank
should have acted early and decisively once it had detected the Government's
lack of diligence in implementing this project. Instead, the Bank tried too
long to salvage the project through adjustment of the project scope, and



- 12 -
subsequex.tly asked the Government to make a request for cancellation. This
approach was, however, unsuccessful due to the Government's failure to
respond. The only available easy alternative was to await the closing date.
This approach did not serve any useful purpose of either the Government or
the. Bank.

Notes:
Between loan signing and loan effectiveness (july 1979 to August 1980) estimated project
costs escalated from TT$131.1 million (US$54.6 million) to TT$337 million (US$140.4
million).
aJ The proposed revision suggested that the project be implemented in two phases. Items
marked a/ to be deferred to second, post-1985, phase under a follow-up project.  It
should further be noted that between May 1981 and August 1982, overall estimated project
costs increased from TT$393 million (US$163.8 million) to TT$451 million (US$187.9
million).
b/  One new composite school and an extension to one existing senior secondary school to
form a composite school in place of the two junior secondary schools originally planned
(change in government education policy).
c/ Fees, furniture and equipment only. Bank declined to finance civil works because of
unacceptable tender procedures.
d/ Some technical assistance included to prepare briefs for National Curriculum and Teacher
Development Center, and Regional Teacher Development Center.
e/ Construction costs from savings on construction of two composite school extensions (see
c/ above).
f/  Increased to TT$144 million (US$60 million) in MEC proposal to Cabinet (June 1983), to
include construction costs of extensions to composite schools (see d/ above).
