SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:               Republic of Turkey
Beneficiaries:          Turkish State Railways (TCDD) and General Directorate
of Construction of Harbours, Ports, Airports and
Railways (DLH).
Amount:                 $197 million equivalent.
Terms;                  17 years including four years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Relending Terms:        $188 million would be onlent by the Borrower to TCDD
for a period of 17 years on the same terms and
conditions as the Bank loan, with TCDD bearing the
foreign exchange risk.
Project Description:    The proposed project is designed to support the
Government's effort to increase the operational
efficiency of its railways and to assist the railways
in their financial recovery. The project consists of:
5i) a comprehensive program for improving the
maintenance and management of the locomotive fleet;
(ii) overhaul of about 740 km of m"in line track, and
provision of track overhaul equipment;
(iii) modernization of about 700 km of main line
signalling, (iv) construccion of about 65 km of track;
and (v) technical assistance and training. The
project is also designed to assist in institutional
development through an agreed Action Plan covering
organizational, planning, marketing and financial
objectives as well as measures for improving technical
and operational performance.
Benefits and Risks:     The railways' limited carrying capacity and poor
quality of service is a significant economic
bottleneck, particularly for bulk commodity traffic
for which railways are inherently the most economic
mode. The proposed project would increase railway
carrying capacity, reduce transport costs and help
make Turkish goods more competitive on the world
market. It would also upgrade the quality and safety

of railway services and reduce the burden on the
budget of Government payments for railway operating
expenses. Project technical risks and risks of
inadequate traffic are considered small as the
technical solutions envisaged are based on proven
technology and a substantial portion of the forecast
additional bulk traffic is already available and could
be carried more cheaply by the railways, but is moving
by road due to inadequate railway capacity.
Furthermore, the annual plan mechanism to be followed
by the railways in their investment planning will
allow flexibility in progressive adjustment of
investments to correspond with changes in traffic
levels so as to reduce the risk of over-investment.
The most serious risks concern institutional and
policy improvements. Long-standing traditions in
railway practices might impede introduction of more
modern methods and tariff adjustments could be
delayed. The emphasis of the Government on improving
the accountability and efficiency of public enterprise
management makes this risk manageable. Actions taken
recently freeing tariffs from Government control and
the tariff adjustments introduced in January 1986
support this assessment.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY FOR A
SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of US$197 million to help finance
the foreign exchange cost of a Second Railway Project. The loan would have a
term of 17 years including 4 years of grace, with interest at the standard
variable rate. About $188 million equivalent would be onlent to the Turkish
State Railways (TCDD) on the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan, with
TCDD bearing the foreign exchange risk.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.      An economic mission visited Turkey in June 1982, and its report
entitled "Turkey: Country Economic Memorandum, Recent Economic Developments
and Medium-Term Prospects" (No. 4287-TU) was distributed to the Executive
Directors in June 1983. The report of a mission to review the financial
sector, entitled: "Turkey: Special Economic Report - Policies for the
Financial Sector" (No. 4459-TU), was distributed in September 1983. A Bank
mission reviewed the Government's Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1985-89)
in September 1984 and its report: "Turkey: The Vth Five-Year Plan in the
Context of Structural Adjustment" (No. 5418-TU) was distributed in July 1985.
3.      Turkey's area is about 780,000 square kilometers (i.e. about equal to
the area of France and West Germany combined) with a population of around
50 million and GNP per capita of $1200 in 1984. The density of population is
low (78 per square kilometer of agricultural land), and about 47 percent live
in urban centers. Population growth (2.2 percent per annum) is below the
median for middle-income countries. Despite rapid economic growth in the
mid-1970s as well as emigration of workers (to Western Europe and more
recently, to the Middle East), there is still substantial unemployment which,
including disguised unemployment in agriculture, is estimated at about
19 percent of the civilian labor force. There is, however, little or no
absolute poverty, although income distribution is skewed. There are
considerable regional differences in income and large rural-urban
disparities. Recent data indicate a probable increase in income inequality
since the 1970s, especially a relative deterioration of the position of wage
and salary earners and an improvement in the position of the trading and
commercial classes, and, more generally, of capital-owners. Educational
enrollment has expanded greatly, but the level of adult literacy remains
relatively low compared to the European average for middle income countries.
1/ Parts I and II are substantially the same as Parts I and V of the
President's Report for the Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (P-4258-TU)
dated May 15, 1986.



-2-
Background
4.       During the 1970s Turkey did not make the necessary adjustments to the
shocks caused by the steep rise in oil prices, stagflation in the OECD
economies, and the consequent deterioration of its terms of external trade.
Until 1977 Turkey maintained high rates of economic growth by increasing
public investment. The foreign exchange requirements were financed initially
by workers' remittances and then increasingly by borrowing, a large part of it
short-term. The rapid GNP growth came to an abrupt halt in 1977 as the
massive external debt burden led to a sharp deterioration in creditworthiness,
severe shortages of imports, disruptions in industrial production and a rise
in unemployment. By the end of 1979, domestic inflation had also become an
issue of critical importance.
5.       In response to the crisis of the late 1970s, the Turkish authorities
made a major shift in development strategy in 1980, moving towards outward
orientation and giving an increased role to market forces. To alleviate the
balance of payments constraint and import shortages, policies were adopted to
expand exports, increase workers' remittances, liberalize imports, encourage
foreign investment and improve external debt management. On the domestic
frout, the objectives were a reduction in the inflation rate, reform of the
State Economic Enterprises (SEEs), a more efficient financial sector, improved
resource mobilization and better selection of investments, especially in the
public sector.
6.       The adjustment program, which has been supported by the Bank through
five Structural Adjustment Loans and an Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan,
involves far-reaching changes in attitudes, institutions, and the legal and
policy framework, all of which require time to be put in place. M4ajor
structural changes have been made in the exchange rate system, the export and
import regimes, the tax system, interest rate and selective credit policies
and the public investment program. Implementation of the adjustment program
started in January 1980, continued under a military regime during the period
September 1980 - November 1983, and has since been carried out by an elected
government.
The Structural Adjustment Program, 1980-85
7.       The Turkish ecunomy has shown an impressive response to the
structural adjustment program and the outcome met or exceeded the Government's
own targets through 1982.  The overall performance deteriorated in 1983 due to
a corabination of factors (slowdown of export growth, slippages in the monetary
program, shortfall in Government revenues), but improved again, except in the
area of inflation and the budget deficit, in 1984. The improvement was
maintained in l985, this time including a slowdown in inflation and a
reduction in the budget deficit.
8.       After expanding by 4.1 percent in 1981 and 4.6 percent in 1982, real
GNP growth slowed down to 3.2 percent in 1983, due to the effects of a bad
harvest, stagnant exports and lower workers' remittances. The growth rate
rebounded in 1984 to 5.9 percent, mostly on account of favorable performance
in agriculture (3.7 percent growth) and industry (9.3 percent growth).



-3-
Merchandise exports also expanded strongly, by more than 25 percent in dollar
terms.  In 1985, according to the latest estimates, the economy grew by about
4.9 percent, as against the program target of 5.5 percent. The slowdown in
growth was most significant in agriculture (2.2 percent growth) and
manufacturing (5.5 percent), due respectively to less favorable climatic
conditions and slackening domestic demand. On the expenditure side, the
average annual real rate of growth of public fixed investment over the period
1980-84 was 3.8 percent.  Provisional estimates for 1985 indicate that public
fixed investment totalled TL 3,289 billion, implying a much higher real growth
(12.8 percent) over 1984 than programmed (5.8 percent). However, the size of
public investment is overestimated for two reasons: (i) the increase in local
currency cost of outstanding foreign debt due to devaluation is included in
the investment figures for ongoing projects; and (ii) interest costs incurred
by ongoing projecrs are also added to public investment. Rough calculations
indicate that these could add up to as much as 30 percent of the total
investment figure for 1985 cited above. The growth rate of private investment
has fluctuated more severely, falling by 17 percent in 1980, recovering
slowly, and then rising by 7.1 percent in both 1984 and 1985. Private
consumption, after declining by 5 percent in real terms in 1980, grew by
5 percent in 1983 and 1984 before slowing down to an estimated 3.8 percent in
1985. Strict budgetary discipline contributed to a steady decline in the real
rate of growth of public consumption frow 8.4 percent in 1980 to 1.8 percent
in 1983; however, it increased to 3.2 percent in 1984 and an estimated
3.3 percent in 1985.
9.       During 1981-82, the Government met with considerable success in
reducing the rate of inflation through a combination of fiscal, monetary and
incomes policies. After peaking at 107 percent in 1980, the average annual
rate of increase in the wholesale price index (WPI) decelerated to 37 percent
in 1981 and 27 percent in 1982. In 1983 the downward trend was reversed and
the inflation rate rose to 30 percent. Inflation accelerated further in 1984,
and reached 50 percent, due to the lagged impact of the expansionary monetary
policy pursued during the second half of 1983, and a significant increase in
agricultural product prices, especially of fresh fruits and vegetables, as a
consequence of export liberalization and higher export market prices. Other
coutributory factors included substantial "catch up" increases of SEE prices -
since January 1984 most SEEs have effectively been allowed to set their prices
freely - and higher import prices resulting from the nominal depreciation of
the Turkish lira. In addition, inflationary pressures stemmed from a larger
than anticipated budget deficit in 1984 as a result of a slowdown in the
growth of revenues.
10.      In 1985 inflation declined considerably -- the average annual rate of
increase in the WPI fell to 43.2 percent, after reaching a very high level in
the first quarter of 1985 (about 60 percent as of March 1985). By
December 1985, the month-over-month change in the WPI (i.e. December 1985 over
December 1984) had correspondingly declined to 38.3 percent and by March 1986
it had dipped even further, dropping to below 30 percent for the first time in
two and half years. Factors causing the high inflation rate in the first
quarter of 1985 were the introduction of a value added tax (VAT) in
January 1985 and continued substantial increases in the. prices of several key



-4-
intermediate goods and inputs. Thereafter, several factors combined to lower
inflationary pressures: Ci) monetary growth slowed, particularly in the
fourth quarter, with M2 growth declining from an annual rate of 64 percent as
of September 1985 to 53 percent at year-end; (ii) by April 1985 most of the
catch-up increases in the prices of SEE products appeared to have been
completed and the rate of price adjustment abated considerably; (iii) the
significant slide of the dollar, which started after March 1985, resulted in a
slowing down of the nominal depreciation of the Turkish lira against the
dollar and therefore in smaller increases in prices of imported products than
were witnessed in 1983-84; (iv) the persistence of high real interest rates
(which increased as inflation declined) helped to channel liquidity towards
savings rather than consumption and thus lowered aggregate demand; and
(v) lower exports of certain agricultural products (cereals and pulses) meant
that the domestic market was well supplied, thus easing inflationary pressures
on food prices. The steady deceleration in the inflation rate, which has now
continued for over 12 months, reinforces the expectation that the Government's
target rate of 25 percent for 1986 could be achieved, particularly considering
the large decline in world oil prices since January 1986, the continued
weakening of the dollar relative to other international currencies, and the
Government's maintenanca of a tight monetary and fiscal program.
11.      In the fiscal area, progress has been uneven.  During 1980-82 the
budget deficit declined from 5.3 to 2.i percent of GNP, but increased to
almost 5 percent of GNP in 1984, due mainly to a disappointing performance in
raising tax revenues. In 1985, however, the budget deficit is estimated to
have been TL 621 billion or 2.3 percent of GNP, a significant improvement over
1984. This is largely because the Government took several measures in 1985 to
increase revenues, the most important of which was the introduction of VAT.
In its first year, VAT collections amounted to about TL 1 trillion,
significantly above the target. Other tax measures which were adopted
included substantial increases in various fixed charges and duties and large
increases in penalties for overdue tax payments. As a result of these
measures, budget revenues rose from 15.4 percent of GNP in 1984 to 17 percent
in 1985, reversing the downward trend in revenues over the previous three
yea-s. Government expenditures decreased from 20.3 percent of GNP in 1984 to
an estimated 19.3 percent in 1985.
12.      Progress has also been made in rationalizing interest rates and
reforming the banking system. Since 1981, interest rates on time deposits at
commercial bauks have been positive in real terms. Time deposits have been
yielding a positive real return since early 1984. Positive deposit interest
rates have resulted in a steady growth in deposits, about 10 percent per annum
in real terms in 1984 and 1985. Improvements in incentives for savings were
accompanied by administrative reforms of the banking system, the enactment of
a new banking law, and measures to revitalize the capital market.
13.     While positive real interest rates have provided an incentive to
save, they have also meant high borrowing costs. Effective nominal interest
rates range from 6U to 8U percent on non-preferential credits, in part because
of the impact of high liquidity and reserve requirements, the option which



-5-
commercial banks have to invest in high-yielding government bonds, and high
intermediation costs. The Government took a number of steps in 1985 to reduce
the interest rate differentials between preferential and non-preferential
credits: in particular, the preferential interest rate for export credits was
discontinued in January 1985, while, during the year, interest rates for
larger agricultural loans and for loans to SEEs were increased from 28 and
22 percent to 34 and 35 percent respectively. The narrowing of cte gap
between interest rates on preferential and non-preferential credits, together
with the decrease effected in the amount of preferential credits, is expected
to increase the general availability of credit and exert a downward pressure
on non-preferential interest rates.
14.      Improvements in the balance of payments were substantial between 1980
and 1982, with the current account deficit decreasing from $3.3 billion
(5.7 percent of GNP) in 1980 to $1.2 billion (1.6 percent of GNP) in 1982. In
1983 the current account deficit increased to $1.8 billion, as merchandise
exports stagnated and workers' remittances fell by one-third. These
developments were reversed in 1984 as exports increased by over 25 percent in
dollar terms to reach $7.4 billion. Remittances, too, registered a higher
than expected increase, reaching $1.8 billion (up by 20 percent over 1983).
Merchandise imports grew by more than 16 percent to reach $10.8 billion. As a
result of these developments, both the trade and the current account deficics
declined as compared to 1983. Latest estimates for 1985 indicate a further
strong improvement of the balance of payments situation. Merchandise exports
grew by 11.6 percent (in dollar terms) in 1985, while merchandise imports
increased by 8 percent. Among the invisibles, tourism revenues and investment
income from abroad increased significantly compared to 1984 and previous
years. Workers' remittances, on the other hand, declined by 5 percent. The
current account deficit in 1985 is now estimated at about $1.0 billion, or
about 1.9 percent of GNP.
15.      Merchandise export performance has been impressive throughout the
1980-85 period, during which exports registered an average annual rate of
increase of about 23 percent in dollar terms. This growth has been led by the
manufacturing sector and has involved a rise in the share of exports to the
Middle Eastern countries. Industrial exports, composed primarily of processed
foods ar-i textiles, have risen from 32 percent cf total exports in 1980 to
more than 72 percent in 1985. These results were achieved by a combination of
indirect measures (flexible exchange rate policy, import liberalization) as
well as direct measures (tax rebates, preferential credits) to enhance the
relative profitability of exports and offset the traditional bias towards
production for the domestic market. Successful penetration of the Middle
Eastern markets has brought their share in total Turkish exports from
17 percent in 1980 to around 40 percent in the 1983-85 period.
16.      On the import side, the 1982-83 period was marked by a relative
stability in the growth of merchandise imports, as prices of both oil and
non-oil imports declined, and the volume rate of growth remained moderate. In
1984, however, merchandise imports increased substantially. The increase was
most pronounced in some of the groups (e.g. raw materials and consumer goods)
that have been subjected to major liberalization through a lowering of tariff
rates and a significant removal of quantitative restrictions. In 1985, as



-6-
domestic demand eased, and the initial effects of pent-up demand for
importables released by import liberalization weakened, the rate of import
growth decreased to about one-half of the level recorded in 1984.
MediumrTerm Prospects
17.      The Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1985-89), which was approved by
the Grand Natioaal Assembly in June 1984, reaffirms the Government's
determination to pursate an outward-oriented development strategy and to
liberalize the economy by relying increasingly on market forces. The public
sector is targeted to play a supportive role by concentrating its investments
in infrastructure rather than manufacturing, while the private sector is to be
encouraged to play a leading role in the growth of manufacturing and exports.
Some of the key targets are;
(i)    an average annual GNP growth rate of 6.3 percent;
(ii)    an average annual real rate of growth of merchandise exports of
10.6 percent;
(iii)    an average annual real rate of growth of 10.9 percent in private
investment and 6.8 percent in public investment;
(iv)    a declining external debt service ratio, from 26 percent in 1984
to around 18 percent in 1989; and
(v)    a decreasing rate of inflation reaching 10 percent p.a. in 1989.
18.      While the overall thrust of the Plan is in accord with the goals of
the structural adjustment program, the Plan targets, if viewed collectively
and in the light of the developments in 1984 and 1985, appear somewhat
ambitious and likely to strain domestic resources (especially in the public
sector) as well as have an adverse impact on the external balance.
Accordingly, the Government is adjusting the annual programs to ensure that
they remain compatible with the fight against inflation and with a growth
strategy commensurate with the Government's ability to generate resources.
19.      The recent decline in international oil prices is likely to have a
favorable impact on Turkey's balance of payments. The Bank's projections
presented below take into account the most recent decline in oil prices. The
analysis shows that the savings from direct petroleum imports alone could be
about $1.3 billion in 1986. The favorable direct impact would be offset to
some extent by lower export growth to oil-exporting countries (which account
presently for about 4U percent of Turkey's exports) as well as lower profit
and workers' remittances from construction activities in these countries.
However, a compensating increase in Turkish exports to, and workers'
remittances from, OECI) countries on account of a more favorable OECD growth
outlook is likely in the medium term. Our estimate puts the net positive
impact of the oil price decline on Turkey's balance of payments at about
¢400 million in 1986. There would be indirect benefits as well in the medium
term, including a reduction in the cost of debt servicing as a consequence of
a decline in inflation and interest rates in OECD countries. An improvement

in the balance of payments would give the Govrernment the option of repaying
its external debt sooner, thus improving Turkey's debt service ratio in the
coming years, or using the extra resources to support a faster growth
strategy. Given the uncertainty associated with the oil price projections, we
have been cautious in revising GDP growth targets significantly at this time,
in order to emphasize inflation control and a greater build-up of foreign
exchange reserves.
20.           The Bank's projections indicate a GDP growth of 5.9 percent p.a. on
average for the 1986-90 period. At the beginning, growth might be relatively
slow (5.3 percent p.a.), gradually accelerating in the outer years to an
average rate of 6.1 percent p.a. in 1987-90. The inflation targets in the
Bank's projections are also more conservative compared to the Plan targets,
implying a reduction from about 43 percent in 1985 to around 18 percent in
1990. Key economic variables in the Bank's projections for the period 1986-90
are presented in Table 1.

21.      Achievement of these growth rates will depend primarily on the
performance of agriculture and manufacturing. This in turn will depend to a
large extent on the Government's determination to constrain the growth of the
public sector in line with resources and to create a more favorable investment
climate for the private sector. This translates into a projected real growth
in public fixed investment of about 3.9 percent p.a. on average for the
1986-90 period. In light of the developments in 1985, this implies a tighter
control of public investment. The comparable figure for the growth of private
fixed investment is 10.6 percent p.a. The projections allow for a modest
increase of per capita consumption of slightly above 3.0 percent p.a. on
average over the period 1986-90.
22.      Merchandise exports are projected to grow at an average rate of
8.1 percent per annum in real terms during 1986-90. This assumes the
maintenance of a realistic exchange rate, further import liberalization and
the ability of Turkish exporters to take advantage of higher expected growth
in the OECD market. Merchandise imports are projected to grow at an average
amnual rate of 7.4 percent. This is consistent with the import liberalization
program of the Government. On these assumptions, the current account deficit
is projected to decrease to $927 million in 1990 as compared to an estimated
198J figure of $i,013 million. The projected capital account would remain
manageable throughout the period, even in the face of some sharp increases in
amortization payments arising from the debts rescheduled during 1978-80.
23.      The medium-term scenario presented above is, of course, only one of
many possibilities and is used specifically to illustrate Turkey's potential
in the light of the Government's own development strategy. Given Turkey's
progress in the structural adjustment program, the favorable response which
this has evoked from the international finanicial community, and the present
outlook for both lower oil prices and a decline in interest rates, the GNP
growth projected in the medium-term base case scenario could be exceeded if
the current account deficit is lowered and there is an improvement in the
mobilization of public resources.
24.      In view of the sensitivity of the projections to the assumptions
regarding export growth, a downside risk case has also been ieveloped. With
Turkey's export performance heavily dependent on exogenous factors such as the
world economic conditions and movements in international prices, a slower
growth of merchandise exports (an average of about 6 percent p.a. over the
l9bb-90 period) coupled with lower mobilization of public resources (3 percent
lower revenues than envisaged under the base case scenario) would lead to a
more difficult but still manageable balance of payments situation, a lower GDP
growth (averaging about 4.7 percent p.a.) and a higher debt service ratio. In
such a situation the Government would have less chance of absorbing the
unemployed and improving tangibly the average standard of living. However, if
the Government in such circumstances were to resort to a high growth strategy,
then it could witness a repeat of the situation which prevailed in the 1970s,
and which led to a debt crisis. It is unlikely that the Government would risk
such a situation. It is therefore more probable - even if exogeneous
developments are unfavorable - that the Government would continue with the
structural adjustment program as implemented to date.

External Debt and Creditworthiness
25.      At the end of 1978, Turkey had $7.2 billion in short-term debt and
$7.0 billion in medium and long-term debt. Between 1978 and 1980, Turkey
rescheduled some $9.2 billion of outstanding obligations through a series of
rescheduling arrangements concluded with official and commercial creditors.
Following the resolution of the debt crisis, inflows were mostly from official
sources -  OECD countries, the World Bank and the IMF.  Since 1983 commitments
from commercial banks have outstripped those from official sources and have
reached an estimated level of $2.4 billion by end-1985. Of the estimated
total debt outstanding of $25.4 billion (including IMF) at end-1985, medium
and long-term debt accounted for about 75 percent. Short-term debt as a
percentage of total debt outstanding fell from 51 percent in 1978 to about
11 percent in 1982, then increased to an estimated 25 percent in 1985. Much
of this growth in the stock of short-term debt is due to the inflows
associated with the Dresdner Bank scheme. 1/ At end-1985, the outstanding
liabilities associated with the Dresdner scheme amounted to $2.7 billion,
constituting 40 percent of short-term external obligations. Inflows from the
Dresdner scheme have been steadily growing with few withdrawals, which is
clearly a reflection of increased confidence in the Government's economic
policies. The Government is sensitive, however, to the build-up of short-term
debt and intends to limit its share of total debt in the medium term to the
present level. Based on the growth scenario outlined in paras. 19-22, debt
outstanding and disbursed as a percentage of GDP is projected to fall from an
estimated 46 percent in 1985 to 38 percent in 1990. This translates into a
forecast of total debt outstanding in 1990 of $31 billion, with short-term
debt constituting about 26 percent of the total.
26.      The debt service ratio for medium and long-term credits increased
from about 26 percent in 1984 to an estimated 31 percent in 1985, mostly as a
result of large repayments of rescheduled debt falling due. Debt service
obligations are expected to be on average about $4.3 billion a year during
1986-90, a quarter of which is attributable to service obligations on
rescheduled debt. However, the debt service ratio is projected to decrease to
about 25 percent in 1990, due largely to improvements in the current account
of the balance of payments. The debt burden should remain manageable provided
current policies are successfully implemented, the export drive is sustained,
and Turkey continues to receive support from international commercial and
official sources. Confidence in Turkey's overall economic performance, its
stable record in meeting debt servicing obligations and its improved debt
management, encouraged commercial banks to commit about $1.9 billion of
medium-term credits in 1985. In the first quarter of 1986, nearly
$500 million out of a total of $700 million borrowed from commercial banks
consisted of medium and long-term loans. Several major American, European,
Japanese and Middle Eastern banks have been involved in these operations.
1/    Under this scheme the Dresdner Bank collects deposits from Turkish
workers in West Germany and automatically places these funds at the
disposition of the Central Bank of Turkey, which guarantees the deposits
and pays an interest rate commensurate with the Euro-market rate.



-10-
27.      Turkey's economic program has been supported by the IMF through a
series of standby arrangements during 1980-84. The Government did not ask for
a new standby in 1985. The Government's decision seems to reflect the view
that the favorable economic developments in 1985 indicate that Turkey has
"graduated" from the IMF's program and that the IMF presence through
Article IV consultations and periodic staff visits to review the economic
performance should suffice for purposes of maintaining international
confidence.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
28.      Through March 31, 1986 the Bank and IDA have lent $6740.7 million 1/
to Turkey, through 92 projects. Agriculture accounts for 23 percent of the
funds lent, industry and DFCs for 22 percent, power for 18 percent, structural
adjustment and program loans for 25 percent, and urban development,
transportation, education, tourism and technical assistance for the remaining
12 percent. Disbursements for all sectors combined averaged 62 percent of
appraisal estimates at the end of March 1986, which compares favorably with
other 'ountries in the region.  As of March 31, 198b, IFC commitments to
Turkey totalled about $254 million, of which about $69 million were still held
by IFC. Annex 11 provides a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and
IFC investments as of March 31, 1986.
29.      Bank lending is aimed at supporting Turkey's mediur-term objectives
of restructuring the Turkish economy by placing more reliance on market forces
and adopting a more outward-oriented strategy. The main vehicle for the
Bank's operational discussions with the Government has been the structural
adjustment lending (SAL) program, which was completed in June 1984, and more
recently the sectoral adjustment lending program. Significant progress has
been achieved in the last five years, but the task of restructuring is by no
means over. The current Five Year Plan involves the broadening and deepening
of the adjustment process at the sectoral level. Recent economic developments
have underlined the need for a continuation of the stabilization program
without giving up the goals of sectoral adjustment. Hence the emphasis of
Bank lending in the post-SAL period will continue to be on striking an
appropriate balance between sectoral adjustment lending designed in part to be
quick disbursing and supportive of policy reforms in the major sectors, and
carefully formulated project lending focussing on high priority projects
principally in the agriculture, energy, industry and transport sectors.
1/ Net of cancellations.



-11-
30.      A series of sectoral adjustment loans for the major sectors is
planned over the next few years. A first loan for agriculture was approved in
June 1985. A financial sector adjustment loan approved in June 1986 is the
second of the series. Further lending of this kind would support measures to
enhance the utilization of industrial capacity in the public and private
sectors, keeping in view the scope for the "privatization" of publicly-held
assets in the manufacturing subsectors. Other sectors where sectoral
adjustment loans are likely to be developed include energy and transport, and
it is expected that there would be a follow-up loan in agriculture.
31.      Project lending, which would continue to make up the majority of the
lending operations, would be designed to support and strengthen the adjustment
process. Some project lending would be earmarked for the construction or
rehabilitation of key projects in the energy sector. Other projects would be
guided by the major policy objectives of the Government, which include
generation of foreign exchange (including improving productivity in export
industries and providing essential infrastructure for exports), improvement of
institutional efficiency, non-inflationary output growth and amelioration of
the social costs of adjustment (including provision of social infrastructure
and employment generation, with some emphasis on the least developed provinces
in Eaistern Turkey).
32.      This would be the first loan to turkey presented to the Executive
Directors in this fiscal year. Other proposed loans being processed include
the Sir hydropower project, vocational training, water supply and sewerage,
urban development, and an energy sector adjustment loan.
33.      Turkey's debt burden is projected to remain manageable throughout
1986-89 (paras. 25 and 26). The Bank Group's share of Turkey's total external
debt was 14 percent in 1984, is estimated at 14.4 percent in 1985, and is
expected to grow to about 20 percent by 1989. Official debt outstanding is
projected to increase from $11.0 billion in 1984 to $14.7 billion in 1989 and
private medium and long-term debt outstanding is projected to increase from
i5.2 billion in 1984 to $7.5 billion in 1989. The Bank group's share of total
debt service payments is projected to increase from about 12 percent in 1983
to an estimated 13 percent in 1984, and to about 18.6 percent in 1989.
34.      IFC has invested in synthetic yarns, textiles, pulp and paper, glass,
aluminum, cement, iron and steel products, heavy diesel engines, motor bicycle
engines, piston rings, food processing and tourism. It has also invested in
the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) and provided guarantees for
overseas contracting firms. In addition, IFC is currently providing technical
assistance to the Government with respect to the development of the capital
market and a regulatory framework for leasirg.



-12-
PART III - TIE TRANSPORT SECTOR AND THE RAILWAY SUBSECTOR
35.      Turkey has an area of about 780,000 square kilometers, of which about
50 percent rises over 1,600 meters. The construction of the transport system
has been difficult because of the rugged topography and heavy winter frost and
snow. Nevertheless, the network extends through all major provincial areas,
although access to some regions, especially in the east, is limited by the
difficult terrain. In addition to supporting Turkey's commercial and
industrial activity and foreign trade, the transport system affords
opportunities for lucrative transit trade between Europe and the Middle East.
The widespread distribution of population and economic activity and the
difficult terrain over much of the country means that transport is relatively
costly. The transport system must adjust to (i) the Government's revised
develoment strategy which has led to a rapid increase in exports and
liberalization of imports; (ii) a major increase in the proportion of Turkey's
foreign trade going to the Middle East; and (iii) the sharp increase in
transit traffic including containerized cargo brought about by the Iran/Iraq
conflict. To these requirements must be added a backlog of rehabilitation and
modernization needs due to neglect of these aspects during much of the 1970s.
36.      The backbone of Turkey's transport system is the 8,200 km railway
network and the 60,000 km state and provincial road network. The road system
also includes about 240,000 km of rural roads and about 250,000 km of forestry
roads. In addition, the transport sector includes private and state-owned
international and coastal shipping serving 12 major ports as well as many
smaller facilities, the state-owned Turkish Airlines (TRY) which serves
domestic and international routes, and a system of civil and military
pipelines.
37.      The present pattern of traffic flow reflects the rapid growth and
dominance of road transport, which has increased its share of freight traffic
from 43 percent in 1960 to 75 percent during the 1980s, during which period
the railways' share of freight traffic decreased from 55 percent to
12 percent. In parallel, the highway system's share of passenger traffic rose
from about 73 percent to 95 percent. The share of coastal shipping has not
grown significantly in recent years. The decline in the railways' traffic
share has not been the result of price competition from other modes, since
raiLway tariffs are low, but rather of the railways' limited carrying capacity
and poor quality of service, due to a shortage of motive power and outmoded
traffic management systems. While some of the traffic shift to the roads
system is appropriate, there has also been an increasing use of trucks for
long-distance haulage of bulk commodities, such as lignite, cement, and
fertilizer, which could be transported more economically by rail. Use of
trucks for such commodities adds to transport costs, increases problems of
congestion and safety, and has caused rapid deterioration of highways designed
for lighter traffic.
38.      The ports system has responded well to the changing patterns of
trade, involving increases of foreign cargo at a rate of 11 percent per year
since 1979, plus increases of coastal traffic at about 2 percent annually.



-13-
However, several ports are now experiencing some constraints due to increased
export traffic and the shift to container traffic. These problems are being
addressed in the Bank-assisted Third Ports Project (Loan 2535-TU, approved in
May 1985).
39.      Inadequate attention to rehabilitation and modernization of transport
facilities and equipment now constitutes an impediment to economic growth.
Roads are below standard for present traffic levels, railway track is worn out
and the railways lack adequate motive power and supporting facilities.
Moreover, the Government's increased emphasis on foreign trade has added to
the demands on the system while increasing the importance of reducing costs to
maintain competitiveness in international markets. The failure of the
railways to realize their full potential, has increased the burden on other
modes and become a serious bottleneck for the economy.
40.      Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination.  Responsibility for
transport sector planning, policy development and investment is divided among
several entities. The main agencies involved are: (a) the Ministry of
Transport and Communications, which is responsible for formulation of
transport policy and also oversees the main operating agencies in the
transport sector - the Turkish State Railways (TCDD), the Turkish Maritime
Organization (TDI), Turkish Cargo Lines (TCL), and Turkish Airlines (THY);
(b) the Ministry of Public Works and Settlement (NPW), which is responsible
for planning and execution of major transport infrastructure construction
projects including railways and highways; (c) the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry and Rural Affairs, which is responsible for planning, building and
maintaining the large network of rural and forestry roads; and (d) the State
Planning Organization (SPO), which coordinates sectoral planning and helps
determine project priorities.
41.      The need for improved coordination in the transport sector and for
ensuring an appropriate determination of modal, sector and national priorities
has been recognized by the Government and is incorporated as a major goal in
its development plans. The Government's objectives are embodied in the
National Transport Master Plan (NTMP), prepared for the period 1983-1993. To
take changing conditions into account, the Government intends to update the
NiMP every three years, the first revision being scheduled for 1986. At
present the operating document is the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1985-89), which
reflects lower investment goals than the NTMP in view of limitations on
available resources. This is supported by five-year programs for each
transport agency established for the period 1985-89, which will be updated
annually.
Bank's Role in the Sector
42.      The Bank has been involved in detailed policy discussions on
institutional and investment issues in the transport sector in the context of
preparation of a Transport Sector Memorandum in 1983 and more recently
through a Transport Investment Plan Review concluded in July 1985. Through
its involvement in the sector, the Bank has reached a broad consensus with the
Turkish authorities on the main issues and goals of the transport sector,



-14-
including in particular the need for increased emphasis on maintenance and
rehabilitation, movement toward cost-based tariffs, and increasing railway
operational efficiency. The Bank has also assisted the authorities in
addressing a wide range of sectoral issues through its involvement in project
preparation and implementation in highways, railways and ports. Improved
planning and better selection of highway projects, as well as a shift from
force account work to construction by contract, are being achieved under the
two ongoing highway projects. Assistance is being provided for the
introduction of a modern system of handling containers in the Third Ports
Project supported by the Bank. In the presently proposed project, assistance
would be provided to deal with major bottlenecks impeding railway operations,
particularly through improvements in locomotive availability, traffic
organization, safety and reduction of financial deficits.
Experience with Past Lending
43.      The Bank has participated in six projects in the transport sector
with loans totalling about $513 million equivalent (net of cancellations).
These include $2U8.5 million for three port projects of which two (Loans 28-TU
and 1741-TU) are completed while the third (Loan 2535-TU) was approved in
1985, and *257.5 million for two highway projects (Loans 2137-TU and 2439-TU),
both of which are ongoing and scheduled for completion in June 1987 and
December 1990 respectively. The only previous railway lending was a loan of
$47 million (Loan 893-TU) to assist in financing the firet three-year tranche
of the railways' 1972-77 Investment Plan. This loan was closed in June 1981.
Project implementation in the transport sector has generally been satisfactory
in achieving physical targets, although there have been some delays. Most of
the problems have occurred in implementing agreed policy reforms or have
involved procurement difficulties. However, implementing agencies are now
familiar with Bank requirements and the Government has recently been
successful in developing a more coordinated and realistic approach cowards
implementing transport sector policy.
44.      The First Railway Project (Loan 893-TU) and the Ports Rehabilitation
Project (Loan 1741-TU) have been the subject of Project Completion Reports.
The completion report on Loan 1741-TU is currently under review in the
Operations Evaluation Department. An Audit Report (No.5768 of June 30, 1985)
has been issued concerning the railway project. Its main conclusions are that
the reforms contemplated in the railway project were ambitious and pervasive
while the time frame for execution was short.  Operational and financial
improvements were not achieved due to poor availability of locomotives and
insufficient tariff adjustments. Delays in project completion were primarily
due to procurement problems and slow progress in arranging technical
assistance. The design of the proposed zecond project takes these issues into
account. The project concentrates on a few major activities rather than
financing a time slice of the total investment program as the first loan did.
Improving the reliability and efficiency of the diesel locomotives of TCDD,
including improvement of workshop facilities, locomotive technology and
maintenance, would be the centerpiece of the new project. The time frame for
project execution is adequate for effective implementation. The staff of the
TCDD are now more conversant with the Bank's procurement procedures through
experience with the Bank-financed port projects. Furthermore, the Government



-15-
has made increasing the efficiency of state-owned enterprises and reduction of
their burden on the budget a major aim of its policy, and is expected to
maintain pressure on the railways to carry out reforms agreed under the Action
Plan (para. b2).
The Railway Subsector
45.      TGDI is responsible for the operation and maintenance of Turkey's
railway system, under the supervision of the Ministry of Transport and
Communications. Government approval is required for such items as investment
plans and annual operating accounts, and was required prior to December 1985
for tariff increases.   SP0 coordinates and helps determine investment
priorities in conjunction with the Treasury. The General Directorate of
Railways, Ports and Airports Construction (DLH) in the MPW, which is largely
independent from TCDD, has responsibility for construction of new
infrastructure investment. TCDD action is also subject to review by the High
Control Board, a Government auditing body responsible to the Prime Ministry.
In addition to the railways, TCDD also owns six major ports which are
separately organized and maintain separate accounts. TCDD manufactures
locomotives and rolling stock in three factories, each managed as an
independent self-accounting unit.
46.      TCDD's Board of Directors, consisting of six members with the
Director General as Chairman, determines railway policy. The Director General
is the Chief Executive Officer of TCDD and is appointed by the Government on
the recommendation of the Minister of Transport and Communications. The
railways are organized into five major departments, each responsible to a
Deputy Director General. While the organization is generally satisfactory,
planning activities, dispersed among the different departments, are not
adequately coordinated. Measures are included in the Action Plan agreed in
connection with this project (para. b2) designed to improve this situation.
The railways currently employ about 60,000 staff, including about 13,000
workers in production shops. Productivity per operational worker has
increased by about 23 percent since 1980, and is reasonable compared to other
railways. However, due to low salaries and slow promotions, the railways
experience a shortage of qualified senior engineering and commercial
personnel. TCDD has recently been authorized to pay salaries comparable to
those in the private sector for selected key personnel.
47.      The railway network comprises about 8,200 route km of which only
231 km are double-tracked. The track is generally in poor condition with
about 60 percent being over 30 years old. Poor track conditions have
necessitated imposition of speed and axle load restrictions on many mainline
sections. This reduces line capacity and significantly increases operation
and maintenance costs. While the telecommunications system is generally
adequate, the signalling system is outmodc., with about 60 percent of lines
without appropriate safety and signalling installations. About 85 percent of
traffic is handled by diesel-electric locomotives, 10 percent by steam
locomotives, and the rest (mostly in the suburban areas) by electric
traction. The steam locomotives are all over 35 years old and are to be
phased out by tile end of 1986. About 30 percent of the freight wagons and



-16-
40 percent of the passenger units have reached the end of their economic
life. Low levels of locomotive availability, due to inadequate workshop
facilities and maintenance systems, lack of spare parts and frequent
accidents, has been a major bottleneck in increasing the railways' operational
capacity.
48.      The railways' operating performance has registered some significant
improvements since 1980, but is still below reasonable standards in many
areas. Freight traffic in 1984 was about 50 percent higher than in 1980 and
passenger traffic about 5 percent higher. The availability of diesel
locomotives increased from 62 percent in 1980 to 78 percent in 1983 but
decreased again to 70 percent in 1984. Freight wagon utilization increased by
29 percent between 1980 and 1984. Wagon turnaround time improved slightly
(from 13.6 to 11.5 days), mostly because more use is being made of block
trains. However, it is still too high, due to delays in loading and
unloading, inefficient marshalling operations and poor availability of
locomotives.
Traffic Projections
49.      The Fifth Five-Year Plan (1985-89) envisages a growth rate of
13 percent per year in rail freight traffic and an increase of the railways'
share of national freight traffic from about 10 percent to 18 percent during
this period. The target fixed for 1989 is 12 billion NTKM,/ as compared to
7.5 billion NTKk achieved in 1984. On the basis of an average haul of about
500 km, this works out to about 24 million tons of originating traffic,
against about 14.8 million tons in 1984. This appears very ambitious.
However, analysis of the trends of important streams of traffic indicates that
at least 5 to 6 million tons of additional freight should materialize by 1989,
consisting mainly of iron ore, lignite, coal and transit traffic.
Consequently, with adequate carrying capacity, TCDD should be able to achieve
at least 10 billion NTKM in 1989. Opportunities for freight traffic growth
are better than for many other railways since TCDD has been turning away
traffic due to lack of carrying capacity. As regards passenger traffic, the
railways currently carry only 4 percent of total traffic and the Five-Year
Plan does not envisage any change in this percentage during the Plan period,
since any reduction in the railways' share of inter-city traffic is likely to
be offset by a corresponding increase in their share of suburban traffic.
Financial Situation
5U.      Due to a combination of declining traffic, poor operational
efficiency and inadequate increases in tariff levels, the railways have since
1959 required Government contributions to meet operational expenditures.
Customer contribution to total operating expenses declined to 36 percent in
1980 but has increased thereafter to reach 44 percent in 1984 and an estimated
48 percent in 1985. This improvement reflects a combination of higher traffic
volumes and increases in tariffs at a rate faster than inflation. Customer
1/  Net Ton Kilometers of actual freight carried, excluding weight of wagons.



-17-
contribution to costs in 1984 ranged from 52 percent for freight traffic
(65 percent estimated in 1985) to 44 percent for suburban pasisengers
(52 percent in 1985) and 18 percent for other passengers (26 percent in
1985). Revenue from freight traffic amounts to about 80 percent of total
railway revenues. The Government has made compensation payments to the
railways based upon expenditures for track maintenance and repair ($46 million
in 1984), operation of uneconomic lines for social reasons ($16 million),
freight tariff increases refused '$102 million), and suburban passenger fare
increases refused ($11 million). There has been no direct Government payment
for losses on inter-city passenger services. As of January 1986 the railways
have been authorized to set their own rates, and payments for fare increases
refused have been eliminated. While Government payments to the railways have
declined since 1980 in real terms, they still amounted in 1984 to 25 percent
of total Government payments to meet operational deficits of SEEs. One of the
objectives of this project would be to assist the Government in its efforts to
reduce the railways' burden on the budget (para. 64).
51.      TCDD has financed railway investments from the operating surplus of
its ports, Government funds provided as capital, cash flow resulting from
railway depreciation and foreign borrowings. Following a reorganization of
the ports sector in 1984, separate accounts are now being kept of TCDD port
and railway operations, and the Government could require TCDD to pay dividends
from the profits on its port operations. However, the Government has decided,
at least for the time being, that TCDD be allowed to retain the surplus from
its port operations to assist in financing railway investments.
Railway Investment Program
52.      The railway investment program has been reviewed in detail as part of
the Transport Investment Plan Review (para. 42). The investment program for
the railways in the Five-Year Plan (1985-89) has been reduced from the
proposals submitted by the agencies to a level approximately equal to the Plan
Review's recommendations (about $880 million for TCDD and $330 million for
DLH, in 1984 prices). While the Government has agreed in principle with the
investment priorities recommended in the Plan Review, Government officials
have indicated that further cuts would be required in railway investments
(excluding those proposed for financing under this project) due to
macroeconomic resource constraints. The Government has agreed that no major
new investments for the railways would be taken without appropriate
feasibility studies, which would be discussed with the Bank. In particular,
it was confirmed that there would be no further work on the proposed
Arifiye-Sincan high-speed line from Istanbul to Ankara, beyond completion
during 1986 of existing contracts bringing the line to Cayrihan, unless and
until a feasibility study demonstrates the economic viability of further
investment.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
53.      Project History.  The project was identified in June 1984 and
prepared by the railway agencies with the assistance of Bank preparation
missions. The project was appraised in July 1985. Negotiations were held in



-18-
Washington in March 1986 with a Turkish delegation led by Mr. Hikmet Ulugbay,
Chief Counselor for Economic and Commercial Affairs, Embassy of the Republic
of Turkey, and including representatives of TCDD, DLH, the Treasury and SPO.
A report entitled "Staff Appraisal Report of a Second Railway Project"
(No. 5898-TU), dated June 2, 1986 is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors. The main features of the loan and project are set out in
the Loan and Project Summary and in Annex III.
Project Objectives and Description
54.      The proposed project is designed to assist the Government in
overcoming major impediments to the efficiency of its railway operations, so
as to enable the railways to handle the traffic for which they are inherently
the most economic mode, particularly long-distance bulk traffic. This would
in turn reduce the costs of transport to the economy, improve Turkey's
competitiveness in international markets and facilitate the export drive. The
project would also assist the railways in their financial recovery and thereby
reduce the burden of subsidies on the budget. These objectives would be
achieved through:
(i)    a program for improving di"sel locomotive maintenance and
operational management, so as to increase locomotive
availability;
(ii)   overhauling about 740 km of mainline track, providing track
overhaul equipment and replacing about 700 km of obsolete
mainline signalling systems, so as to improve operational
efficiency and reduce accidents;
(iii)  construction of about b5 km of new track
(Bedirli/Hanli-Bostankaya), consisting of a second track on a
new alignment, to remove a bottleneck to the movement of bulk
commodities; and
(iv)   technical assistance and training.
In addition, the project would provide a vehicle for implementation of an
agreed Action Plan for the railways covering organizational, planning,
marketing and financial objectives as well as measures for improving technical
and operational performar.ce.
55.      Improvement of Diesel Locomotive Availability and Efficiency - The
low availability and efficiency of the diesel locomotive fleet reduces
seriously the capacity and profitability of the TCDD system as a whole. The
proposed project would improve locomotive maintenance and operation systems
through systematic use of the part exchange method, centralized reconditioning
of the dismantled parts, improved turnaround planning and deployment control,
modernization of the workshop and stores equipment, and procurement of a stock
of components and spare parts. The project would also involve a one-time
overhaul of immobilized and unreliable locomotives, phasing-out weak points in
locomotive design, and introducing electronic data processing systems for
improving locomotive maintenance and operations.



-19-
56.      Track Overhaul and Improved Signalling -  Poor track conditions and
obsolete signalling systems have resulted in reduced line capacity, serious
safety problems, ard a significant increase in operation and maintenance
costs. About 740 km of rail, in some cases about 55 years old, would be
replaced to increase the permissible axle load to 20 tons and design speed to
120 km/h. Track maintenance machinery would be provided to assist TCDD in
carrying out a priority program for overbaul of 1,000 km of track during
1985-89. About 700 km of the Kayas-Cetinkaya line would be provided with
modern station signalling and interlocking equipment, including automatic line
block and train automatic stopping equipment. These investments would improve
line capacity and rolling stock utilization, and reduce the number of
accidents.
57.      New Construction - Improvement of line capacity on the short stretch
between Bedirli/Hanli and Bostankaya would greatly facilitate long distance
movement of iron ore from the Divrigi mines to the steel plants in the
north-western region as well as international transit traffic. Two distinct
streams of iron ore traffic from the Divrigi mines pass through this area, one
going to Samsun for the Eregli steel plant (being modernized with assistance
from Loan i606-TU) and the other going to the Karabuk steel plant (assisted
under Loan 1998-TU). Both streams of traffic converge through a single line
through a short section of track near Sivas, which constitutes a bottleneck
reducing carrying capacity on the whole system. This traffic will increase
further during the next 5 to 10 years with planned increases in steel
production at Eregli. The construction of a second line on this short section
(about 65 km) would remove the existing bottleneck and significantly improve
railway capacity for carrying long-haul bulk traffic.
58.      Technical Assistance and Training - Technical assistance to improve
the organization of bulk commodity movements and strengthen railway
uperations, locomotive maintenance and management information systems would be
undertaken by three senior experts supported by five middle-level assistants
appointed to "in-line" positions within TCDD for 48 manmonths.  These advisors
and their assistants are expected to contribute significantly to institution
building, management improvement and introduction of new technology. The
project would also provide for a study to develop and implement a
computer-assisted management information system for locomotive maintenance and
operation, to be carried out by TCDD's electronic data processing center with
the assistance of the locomotive maintenance/operatiotn experts. Terms of
reference and a schedule for recruitment for the experts have been agreed. Ir
order to assist TCDD in manpower development, the proposed project would
include about 300 manmonths of technical visits and training under an agreed
program for railway senior and middle management and specialists through
"twinning" arrangements with other European railways engaged in similar
works. In addition, the project would finance training equipment and
materials for in-country training including provision of a simulator for
locomotive driving. A program for utilization of this simulator would be
submitted by June 30, 1987 for Bank approval prior to purchase of this
equipment. The project would also include provision of 3U manmonths of
foreign training for key technical personnel of DLH. Submission of an
acceptable DLH staff training program would be a condition of disbursement for
this component.



-20-
Cost Estimates and Financing
59.      The total project cost (including about $150 million of taxes and
duties) is estimated at $582.2 million. The estimated total foreign exchange
component would be about *224.5 million, or about 39 percent of the total
project cost. The above estimates include about 9.5 percent physical
contingencies and price escalation at 7.0 percent for 1986 and 1987,
7.5 percent in 1988, 7.7 percent in 1989 and 7.6 percent thereafter. While
local costs in TL are expected to increase at a faster rate, it is assumed
that the Government will maintain current exchange rate policies which
compensate for differences between local and foreign inflation.
60.      The proposed Bank loan of $197 million would cover about 88 percent
of the foreign exchange cost of the project. About $9 million of the
remaining foreign exchange cost represents proprietary items for which
suppliers' credits or bilateral cofinancing are expected to be available. The
Government would finance the remaining project costs estimated at about
$358 million of local costs (including about $150 million of taxes and duties)
and about $19 million of indirect foreign exchange costs of construction works
(plus any of the items allocated for suppliers' credits or bilateral
cofinancing, should they not materialize). About $188 million of the proceeds
of the Bank loan would be onlent to TCDD on the same terms as the Bank loan,
with TCDD bearing the foreign exchange risk. Signing of a subsidiary loan
agreement on terms acceptable to the Bank would be a condition of loan
effectiveness. The remaining $9 million of the Bank loan would be utilized by
DLh (which is a Government department) for the foreign exchange cost of
directly imported materials for the construction of the
Bedirli/Hanli-Bostankaya line.
Implementation
61.      Detailed engineering for all project components is substantially
completed. DLH would be responsible for the implementation of the new line
works and TCDD for all other project components. Both agencies have the
necessary capability to carry out the project. The technical assistance team
(para. 58) would assist in the implementation of the locomotive maintenance
and operation reforms and the improvement of bulk commodity movements. TCDD
has agreed to appoint a suitably qualified project coordinator to be
responsible for planning and coordinating the implementation of its part of
the project. Similarly, DLH has agreed to appoint a counterpart project
coordinator who would carry out similar responsibilities with respect to the
DLI component, in close liaison with the TCDD project coordinator. Completion
of both appointments would be a condition of loan effectiveness. The project
is expected to be completed by December 31, 1991, with disbursements completed
one year later by December 31, 1992. The 6-1/2 year disbursement period
corresponds to about 90 percent disbursement under the regional sector profile
and about 95 percent under the country sector profile.
62.      Action Plan.  In addition to the carrying out of the investment
program included under the project, project implemeLitation would also include
the carrying out by TCDD of a detailed Action Plan, prepared by TCDD and the



-21-
Government in consultation with the Bank. This Action Plan specifies measures
to be taken by TODD to improve railway operations and productivity, including:
ti)    improvements in organization of traffic movement and planning;
(ii)  measures for reorganizing locomotive maintenance and improving
workshop facilities;
(iii) improvements in planning, marketing and management information
systems;
(iv)   schedules and targets for carrying out the project and
priorities for other railway investments; and
(v)   measures for achieving improved financial performance
(described in paras. 64-66 below).
As part of the Action Plan, TCDD has agreed to prepare by December 1986
operational plans based on agreed operational targets for motive power,
rolling stock and related workshops, and plans for track overhaui and
imrrovements in signalling and telecommunications. These plans would be
reviewed and up-dated annually until project completion.
63.      Procurement, Disbursement and Audit - All goods financed from the
Bank loan (about $195.2 million equivalent) would be procured by international
competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. About
$400,000 would be for technical assistance services procured in accordance
with Bank guidelines, while about $1.4 million would be for overseas training
programs approved by the Bank. For goods to be financed by the Bank,
disbursement would be made against 100 percent of the CIF cost, or 100 percent
of the ex-factory cost for bids won by local manufacturers under ICB.  the
Bank would also finance 100 percent of the cost of internationally recruited
consultants and 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of overseas training
programs. To assist in maintaining an adequate flow of funds for project
expenditure, a revolving fund Special Account, with an initial deposit of
$13 million, would be established in the Central Bank of Turkey. Withdrawals
would be made against full documentation except for reimbursement or
replenishment requests submitted on the basis of statements of expenditure for
contracts or training expenditures valued at $100,000 equivalent or less.
TCDD and DLI would establish and maintain separate accounts to record all
project expenditures. Beports of the audits of such accounts as well as a
report of the annual audit of TCDD's overall operations would be sent to the
Bank within nine months of the end of each financial year.
Financial Issues
64.      The Government has embarked on a policy of reducing the level of
payments from the Treasury to state enterprises, and has made significant
progress overall in this regard. For the railways, in particular, the
Government has already succeeded in achieving some reduction in payments in



-22-
real terms. Further progress is expected to come from a combination of an
increase in the amount of freight carried, improvements in operational
efficiency (particularly from improved locomotive availability and use of unit
trains), and increased tariffs and fares. The Government has agreed that
action would be taken through a combination of efficiency improvements and
adjustments in tariffs and fares to reach agreed targets for the percentage of
operating costs covered by customers. These targets, specified in the Action
Plan, provide for the percentage of costs covered by customers increasing from
52 percent in 1984 for freight to 100 percent in 1990, from 44 percent in 1984
for suburban passengers to 75 percent in 1990, and from 18 percent in 1984 for
other passenger services to 50 percent in 1990. Phased targets are also
included in the Action Plan for intermediate years. Based upon the above
assumptions, the level of payments from the Government toward railway
operating expenses would decline from an estimated $140 million in 1985 to
about $45 million in 1990, and the share of operating expenses met by customer
contributions would increase from 48 percent to 87 percent during this
period. Effective January 1986, tariffs were increased by an average of about
20 percent in real terms. These increases are somewhat higher than those
estimated to be required to meet the 1986 targets.
65.      Based upon conservative forecasts (para. 49), the volume of freight
traffic is expected to increase from about 7.5 billion NTKM in 1984 to
10 billion NTKM in 1989. The Bank's financial forecasts assume that
efficiency improvements, including those introduced under this project, would
result in reductions in operating expenses by about 10 percent by 1990. In
addition to these improvements, it is estimated that tariff increases in real
terms averaging 6 percent per year for freight, 4 percent per year for
surburban passengers and 12 percent per year for other passengers would be
required to achieve the agreed 1990 targets.
66.      The estimate above of the fare increase required for "other
passengers" assumes no reduction in the scale of passenger services. As part
of the Action Plan, TCDD has agreed to start a continuing review of passenger
services with the objective of reducing the annual loss under this head.
However, it must be recognized that proposals to reduce passenger services,
whether through the withdrawal of trains or the closure of stat:ons, will meet
resistance, and that implementation of these recommendations will be a slow
and difficult process. Since freight services contribute 80 percent of
railway revenues, the major thrust of the action program is to make freight
service at least self-supporting by 1990. Since existing demand for railway
services exceeds carrying capacity, it is considered possible to increase
tariffs by the amounts indicated on a phased basis together with the expected
efficiency improvements, without impeding achievement of the forecast traffic
growth.
67.      In addition to measures designed to reduce Government payments for
operating expenses, it is necessary to ensure that the railways have
sufficient cash flow, including Government payments, to carry out their
operations and investment programs and to service their debt. The Government
has agreed to guarantee that total TCDD revenues from all sources (including
Government payments and non-operating revenues) would be sufficient to cover



-23-
operating costs and the higher of depreciation or debt service. The
Government has also agreed to take all necessary action to ensure that the
railways would have all the funds required to enable them to carry out the
Project.
Project Benefits and Risks
68.      The proposed project is expected to increase the efficiency of
railway operations, improve the quality of service, and reduce transport
costs. In particular, the project is expected to enable TCDD to carry the
bulk commodity traffic for which the railways should be the most economic
mode. This would reduce transport costs and help make Turkish goods more
competitive on the world market, with beneficial effects on employment and the
balance of payments. The project is also expected to assist in reducing the
burden of the railways on the Government budget.
69.      The economic evaluation of the first two components of the project
listed in paras. 55-56 is based upon benefits from savings in locomotive
purchases required (due to improved availability of existing locomotives),
decreased maintenance and operational costs, increased operating speed,
improved utilization of traction and rolling stock, and fewer accidents.
Expected benefits for the one short section of new track construction are
based upon savings due to avoiding the use of a considerable detour for heavy
bulk traffic or the use of costly road transport for long hauls. Based upon
these benefits, the various project components show estimated economic rates
of return ranging from 14 percent to 26 percent, and averaging 22 percent for
the total project (excluding the technical assistance and training
components). Even with a 15 percent increase in costs and a 15 percent
decrease in benefits, the project would have an economic rate of return of
17 percent. The above calculations understate the full benefits of the
project by excluding such factors as reduced highway congestion, better
working conditions for railway staff, and the comfort and convenience of
travellers on the improved facilities.
70.      Project Risks.  The main area of risk for most railway projects is
traffic forecasting. In this case, the riak involved in making an
over-optimistic assumption regarding rail-borne traffic is relatively low
because of the conservative estimates of traffic used in the analysis. A
substantial portion of the additional bulk traffic is already available and
could be carried more cheaply by railway but is at present moving by road for
want of rail capacity. While the traffic forecast assumes an increase of 2 to
3 million tons of domestic iron ore that would be consumed by steel plants,
this estimate has been carefully reviewed, taking account of the possible
competition from imported steel and the need for a proportion of imported ore
for blending purposes, as well as the recent establishment of an iron ore
beneficiatioi plant at Demirdag and ongoing mining development works. There
appears to be little risk of railway overinvestment, particularly in view of
the annual plan mechanism to be followed by the Government and TCDD which will
allow flexibility in progressive adjustment of investments to correspond with
changes in traffic levels. The most serious risks concern institutional and
policy improvements. Long-standing traditions in railway practices might



-24-
impede the introduction of more modern methods of maintenance and operation.
The provision of assistance by technical experts is expected to be of some
help in this respect, but the most important safeguard is the continuation of
Government interest in effecting efficiency improvements. While there is a
risk that needed tariff adjustments could be postponed, recent action freeing
tariffs from Government control and the tariff adjustments introduced in
January 1986 are encouraging.
PART V - RECOMZENDATION
71.      I am satisfied the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.
