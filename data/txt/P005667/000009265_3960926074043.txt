SECOND SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUbMARY
Borrower:                  The Republic of Tunisia.
Amount:                    US$28.0 million equivalent.
Terms:                     17 years, including 4 years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Project Description        The project would assist in financing economically
and financially vi 'ble small and medium scale
industrial enterprises through a credit line of
US$27.5 million to five participating banks. The
project would al30 include technical assistance to
assist SMI i;t resolving managerial/technical
problems and in designing and formulating new or
extension/ modernization/rehabilitation projects,
and to help coiwercial banks develop the necessary
expertise to improve their appraisal and supervision
of SMI. The cost of technical assistance would be
covered of US$0.5 million from the loan amount and
v ut US$2.15 million from local and bilateral
sources.
Participating Banks:       Banque de Developpement Economique de Tunisie
(BDET), Banque de Sud (BS), Banque de Tunisie (BT),
Banque de Tunisie et des Emirats d'Investissement
(BTEI), and Societ6 runisienne de Banque (STB).
Beneficiaries:             Small and Medium Scale Industrial Enterprises:
defined as (i) for new enterprises: those for which
total investment does not exceed TD 1.5 million,
including working capital, and (ii) for existing
enterprises: those for which total investment for
expansion, moderniz'tion or rehabilitation does not
exceed TD 2.5 million, including working capital and
existing net investments.
Onlending Terms to
Participating Banks
and Beneficiaries:         In order to insulate individual SMI from interest
and exchange rate variations, to permit banks a
reasonable intermediation margin (yet not larger
than 4), to give the Government the opportunity

- iii -
to adjust interest rates during the commitment
period and to conform with the overall
market-oriented, flexible interest rate policy
agreed between the Government and the Bank under
ITPAL, the following onlending scheme has been
agreed upon: initially, the participating banks
would pay the Government the Bank's interest rate
applicable at the time of signing of the Loan
Documents plus a 1 flat fee for foreign exchange
risk coverage which would be borne by the
Government. The participating banks would onlend
the Bank funds to the beneficiaries at 12% per
annum, which would give the banks a margin of nearly
42. The beneficiaries would also pay the banks the
12 flat fee for foreign exchange risk ccverage.
Subsequently, the onlending rates to the
participating banks and the ultimate borrowers may
be revised for the uncommitted balance of the loan,
on the basis of an annual review -- the first to be
held no later than September 30, 1988 -- to be
conducted by the Government, the participating banks
and the Bank, which will take into account changes
in the Bank's interest rate, the cost of other
external resources, the interest rate structure in
the country (particularly, the interest rate for
long-term lending) and the rate of utilization of
the Bank loan. The participating banks would repay
their loans to the Government according to the
composite amortization schedule of the subloans
financed out of the proceeds of the loan. Subloans
to beneficiaries would be for a maximum of eleven
years, including three years grace.
Estimated
Disbursements              Thi proceeds of the loan are estimatad to be
disbursed according to the schedule below, which is
based on the disbursement profile for similar loans
in Tunisia (in US$ '000).

This report is based on Preparation Missions that visited Tunisia in April and
July 1986, and an Appraisal Mission that visited Tunisia from November 3 to
20, 1986. The members of the missions were: Mr. Bernardus H. Pottker (Chief)
and Ms. S. N'Daw (EMPID), Messrs. B. Chavane (ILO) and C. Barltrop
(Consultant). A Pre-Negotiations mission visited Tunisia from September 19 to
30, 1987; it was carried out by M. Carrere, who has modified this report to
reflect the latest developments in the country.



1. INTRODUCTION
1.01     This report appraises a project designed to provide financial and
institutional support to Tunisia's small and medium scale industry (SMI). The
proposed project is a follow-up to the small-scale industry (SSI) project1'
(Loan 1969-TUN) approved in April 1981 and an earlier pilot line (Loan
1504/1505-TUN in 1978), which introduced commercial banks to SSI financing to
foster economic development and job creation. Preparation of the proposed
project was based on the Bank's earlier work on the financial sector-', the
industrial sector-'and the Industrial Trade Policy Adjustment Loan-'.
1.02     The proposed Bank loan of US$28.0 million would be made to the
Government of Tunisia, which would pass on the loan proceeds as follows:
(i)    A line of credit of US$27.5 million to three commercial banks and
two development banks through subsidiary loans agreements, for
financing eligible projects in the SMI sector. The five
participating banks are: Banque de D6veloppement Economique de
Tunisie (BDET; US$ 6.J million), Banque du Sud (BS; US$ 6.0
million), Banque de Tunisie (BT; US$ 5.0 million), Banque de Tunisie
et des Emirats d'Investissement (BTEI; US$ 4.0 million) and Societe
Tunisienne de Banque (STB; US$ 6.0 million). Each of the
participating banks would receive an allocation to cover part of its
estimated resource needs for 30 months. Eighteen months after
effectiveness, the utilization of the loan would be reviewed with
the Government and the participating banks. On the basis of past
progress and expected future utilization of the loan, the unutilized
balance of the loan could be reallocated. This would be formalized
through amendments to the subsidiary loan agreements; and
(ii) US$0.5 millioii for technical assistance to Agence de Promotion de
l'Industrie (API), a non-financial institution which provides
technical assistance to SMI.
1.03      The principal objective of the proposed project is to assist new
entrepreneurs with the financ'-ng of their SMI projects and to help existing
entrepreneurs in the sector to expand, modernize or rehabilitate their firm.
The proposed loan, together with equity finance to be provided by sponsors and
other local funds, is expected to finance investments totalling about US$70
million. Support of SMI should lead to the creation of employment at a
relatively low investment cost, which continues to be a major goal of
Tunisia's industrial development: about 4,000 new jobs would be created, at
an average projected cost of US$17,500 per job. Three commercial banks and two
development banks specialized in SMI financing would benefit from financial
and institutional assistance from the Bank through reviewL. of the projects
financed through the loan (about 20 per participating bank). Technical
assistance for helping to resolve managerial/technical problems and for
improving design and implementation of SMI projects is expected to lead to
more efficient and better operated projects. This assistance would benefit
the projects directly financed by the Bank, as well as the whole SMI subsector.

11. THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
A. Main Characteristics
2.01 Performance. Over the last decade, Tunisia's manufacturing industry has
grown and diversified at a relatively fast pace. It has contributed
successfully to the Government's main economic objectives of creating
employment, attracting foreign investments and know-how, and generating
foreign exchange earnings to offset part of the decline in oil revenues. For
the medium-term, traditional exports (such as phosphate-based industries and
agricultural products) are expected to offer only modest growth prospects, and
further import substitution will provide only limited opportunities for
industrial growth because of the small size oi the domestic market.
Manufacturing exports, therefore, will be the principal instrument for
creating additional employment, stimulating growth and alleviating
balance-of-payments problems.
2.02     In the 1960's and the 1970's, the manufacturing sector grew by 7.42
and 12% per annum in real terms, respectively, and was one of the main sources
of GDP growth, which averaged 7.42 per annum in real terms in the 1970's. The
trends since 1981 are shown in the following table:

In the last six years (1981-1986), GDP growth slowed down (to a 3.4% annual
average), due to weak export merkets for Tunisian products (notably, phosphate
based fertilizers), poor performance of the agricultural sector and growing
inefficiencies in the country. During the same period, the manufacturing
sector grew by 6.4% per year on average. As a result of the faster than
average growth of the manufacturing sector, its share in GDP increased, from
an average of 7.52 in the 1960's to 10.02 in the 1970's and 14.5% by 1986.

231tL/S
Food processing accounts for the largest share of the sector, contributing
21.91 to manufacturing value added in 1986, followed by textiles and leather
(21.11). The fastest growing subsectors in the 1971-1981 period have been
construction materials (20.32 average annual growth in real terms),
miscellaneous industries (14.31), chemicals (14.21) and textiles and leather
(142). From 1981 to 1986, miscellaneous industries, chemicals and
electro-mechanical industries (EMI) have been the leading subsectors with
average growths of 10.12, 8.31 and 8.11, respectively, in real terms.
2.04 Investments. In the period 1981-86, Tunisia maintained a high investment
level, averaging about 292 per annum of GDP. Investments in the manufacturing
industry, which constituted 11.7% of total investments in 1971, kept
increasing and reached 21.51 of total investments in 1983, but decreased to
16.01 in 1985 and 1986, respectively, as shown below:

The lower level of investments in 1985 and 1986 partially reflects the
Government's policy to reduce its overall budget deficit, as revenues from oil
exports and import duties declined. Also, the strong demand pressures
experienced prior to 1985 had to be curtailed through restrictive monetary and
credit policies, which had a negative impact on overall demand (both
consumption and investment) and in turn lead to low capacity utilization in
1985/86. Strict foreign exchange controls by the Central Bank to alleviate
pressures on the balance of payments resulted in shortages of imported



- 4 -
raw and intermediate materials and of spare parts, which led to further
declines in investment. Also, in 1985, the Government announced its plan to
disengage progressively from the productive/competitive sector, where private
initiative was to take over.
2.05     The public sector has traditionally been dominant in the
manufacturing sector. The table below shows the distribution of investments
and value added in the 1982-86 period, between the different industrial
subsectors, on the basis of their ownership status (public/private).

1/ 1986 data are estimates.
Over the 1982-1986 peziod, the public sector averaged almost 58% of total
investments in the sector, of which most was self-financed by internally
generated funds or by bank or supplier's credit. Public sector investments
were generally capital-intensive and had high incremental capital-output
ratios. Whereas 481 of total investments in 1982-1986 were in construction
materials and chemicals (the two subsectors where the public sector is most
dominant), the contribution of these subsectors to total manufacturing value
added was only 22.4%. In contrast, the three subsectors where the private
sector was dominant (textiles, miscellaneous industries and food processing)
accounted for onl- 31.1X of total investments during this period, but
contributed 62.31 o total manufacturing value added.
2.06 Employment. Employment creation has been one of the main objectives of
the Government's industrial policy. Between 1975 and 1980, over 30% of total
new employment (equivalent to 65,000 jobs) was created in manufacturing
industries, and the share of manufacturing industries in total employment
increased from 17.2 to 19.1b. However, over the 1975-1981 period, the



- 5 -
increase in employment in manufacturing industries (5% per year on the
average) remained well below the 10% annual increase in capital stock in the
sector. This development reflects the increasing cost of creating a job in the
non-agricultural productive sectors, which rose from about TD 6,000 in
1972-1976 to TD 10,000 in 1977-1981 and to TD 15,000 in 1982-1986 (all
expressed in 1980 prices). To a large extent, this increase was due to the
substantial investments made in the chemical and construction industries.
2.07     Given that the rapid growth in labor supply has become a major issue
affecting Tunisia's future development, a priority objective of the Government
is the allocation of investment resources to more labor-intensive activities.
So far, employment creation in the manufacturing sector has fallen short of
Planl targets. Under the Sixth Plan (1982-1986), the 80,600 new jobs created
only met 751 of the projected level, primarily because of large shortfalls in
agricultural processing, engineering and miscellaneous industriesl'.
2.08 Export orientation. As a result of the greater emphasis given in the
early 1970's by the Government to the development of export-oriented
industries (Law 72-38 enacted in 1972 and revised in 1985 as Law 85-14),
manufactured exports increased by an average annual rate of 13.61 in real
terms from 1971 to 1981, which was substantially faster than the increase in
manufacturing value added (11.92). However, this tread was reversed in the
last six years, as shown in Table 2.5 below:

During the 1981-1986 period, manufactured exports increased by 5.8% per annum,
which was less than the growth of the manufacturing value added (6.41). The
slowdown in exports is explained in part by that in the phosphate fertilizer

industry, which grew by over 20% in the 1970's but by less than 81 in the
1981-1986 period, and basically stagnated in 1985 and 1986. Furthermore,
adverse weather conditions in 1982 and 1985 caused a slowdown in agricultural
output. Over the 1971-1986 period, the share of manufactured exports
(excluding processed food) rose from 321 of non-petroleum exports in 1971, to
80.5% in 1986.
2.09     During the 1970's, the composition of Tunisia's manufactured exports
changed substantially as shown in the table below:

I/ Estimate.
Whereas 52.9% of all manufactured exports in 1971 consisted of processed food,
this share fell to 9.0% in 1986. The share of textiles and leather increased
from less than 61 in 1971 to almost 40% in 1986, and the share of chemi.cals
doubled to reach one-third of manufactured exports in 1986. Exports of
electro-mechanical industries (EMI) also grew substantially in the second half
of the seventies, and now resiresent 10.6% of total manufactured exports.
B.       Main Constraints and Isues
a. The Need for Adjustment
2.10     During the 1960s and 1970s, Tunisia pursued industrial policies that
(a) gave considerable protection and subsidies to new industries (particularly,
those catering to the local market, creating employment and located in the less
developed regions of the country); (b) provided attractive incentives to export
industries, through a speclal investment law for off-shore industries; and (c)
relied on public enterprises in those areas where private initiative or capital
resources were lacking despite high protection and generous incentives.
2.11     While manufactured exports accounted for an important part of total
non-petroleum exports, textiles and fertilizers accounted in 1986 for
two-thirds of manufactured exports, which shows that Tunisian exports remain



dependent on a very limited number of products. All other sub-sectors have a
predominantly domestic market orientation. This strategy did not present much
of a constraint to growth during the 1970s when manufacturing was still small,
possibilities for import substitution were large, and domestic demand expanded
rapidly, fueled by the two massive world-wide oil price increases and
substantial raises in local salaries. By the mid-1980s, however, the limits
of the past strategy became obvious; by then, the sector was no longer small,
the most obvious import substitution activities had all been exploited and
growth of domestic demand slowed down markedly because of declining oil
production and prices as well as wage freezes that began in early 1.983.
Furthermore, at about the same time, the only two export-oriented subsectors
encountered increasing difficulties: phosphate-based fertilizers because of
depressed world market conditions, and textiles because of increasing
international competition and a slowdown of demand in Western Europe.
2.12     Two other weaknesses became increasingly apparent in recent years:
namely, the extreme dependence of manufacturing production upon imports, and
the high production costs. Given Tunisia's very limited endowment with raw
materials, food processing and fertilizer production are the only two
subsectors that use a significant amount of domestic inputs, and the latter is
crucially dependent on imports of sulfur. Thus, when foreign exchange
earnings fell in 1985, the introduction of import restrictions seriously
hampered the normal functioning of manufacturing enterprises, as the country
could not afford to import all the inputs needed to permit these enterprises
to produce at or near capacity.
2.13     Production costs became high for a variety of reasons; but primarily
because of inefficiencies fostered by high import protection and large
investment incentives granted almost indiscriminately to new enterprises.
This led to the financing of economicallv unwarranted projects,
over-investments, loose management, low labor productivity and little regard
for quality. In addition, labor costs were quite high; in particular, after
the large we.ge increases in 1982 and early 1983, which were exacerbated by
high social security charges. Finally, the appreciation of the Tunisian Dinar
in the early 1980s eroded the competitiveness of manufactured exports.
2.14     In the future, economic policies in the manufacturing sector will
have to focus predominantly on stimulating exports -- particularly, in
non-traditional subsectors - for two reasons: (i) together with tourism,
manufactured exports will have to make up for moa;t of the declining foreign
exchange receipts from oil exports and workers' remittances; and (ii) given
the very limited size of the domestic market, manufacturing production can
grow at a satisfactory rate and crevte sufficient new employment only if the
sector starts to export on a much larger scale. In fact, in many subsectors,
satisfactory economies of scale can only be achievted if production for the
domestic market is supplemented by substantial production for exports. The
fact that Tunisian export industries tend to be labor intensive is an
additional argument in favor of manufactured exports, at a time of increasing
unemployment and underemployment.
2.15     The need for adjustment in industrial policies is being addressed by
a large macro-economic and sectoral adjustment program, to be implemented in
1987-1991, which is supported by the Bank through two sectoral operations: the
Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL; Loan 2754-TUN) and the Industrial
and Trade Policy Adjustment Loan (ITPAL; Loan 2781-TUN).

b. The Macro-Economic AdiustuXent Prog-am
2.16     The main objective of this program is to restructure the ecoaomy
through a progress_ve overall liberalization, including that of prices,
investments and imports. The restructured economy should be more conducive to
growth (mainly through exports), create more efficient and more remunerative
employment, and improve the allocation and use of scarce resources. The main
policy measures and instruments to achieve these objectives are the following:
(i)     Wage and Salary Policy:  The Government is determined to maintain
the restrictive wage and salary policies started in 1983, and to
limit during 1988-1991 the growth of the total wage bill to that
of GDP, while limiting it to less than the increase of the CPI in
1986-1987 -- when only minimum wages were raised;
(ii)     Exchange Rate Policy:  An appropriate exchange rate, allowing for
competitive exports of non-oil/non-phosphate goods and services is
a vital pre-condition for the success of an export-oriented growth
strategy in Tunisia. Over the mid 1985-end 1986 period, the
measures taken reduced by 27% the nominal exchange rate on a trade
weighted average, by more vis-a-vis the major European currencies
(DM, FF) and by less vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar. The Government is
committed to pursuing a flexible exchange rate policy with the
objective of maintaining the real effective value of the Dinar and
ensuring the international competitiveness of the Tunisian economy;
(iii)     Interest Rate Policies:  The Government is committed to a more
flexible and liberal interest rate policy. This policy is applied
to lending (with the exception of certain agricultural credits,
export credits and medium-term loans to SMI) as well as to
two-thirds of deposits with commercial banks;
(iv)     Monetary and Credit Policies:  These policies have four
objectives: (i) to limit the growth of M2 in line with the
growth of GDP; (ii) to phase out the special discount facilities
at the Central Bank and start operating through the money market;
(iii) to reduce the prior approval by the Central Bank for
individual loans provided by the commercial banks; and, in
general, (iv) to reduce the Central Bank's intervention in the
commercial banks' day-to-day management;
(v)     Budget Policies:  In the context of the VIIth Development Plan
(1987-1991), the Government plans further reductions in the
overall budget deficit, with the objective of eliminating the
overall budget deficit by 1991 at the latest. This objective
would be achieved largely through cuts in expenditures;
(vi)     Price Policies:  The Government intends to abolish price controls
for all manufactured goods by 1991. With respect to the 252 of
manufactured products for which price controls will continue for
an interim period, a new more flexible price control system was
introduced in early 1987. The new system will avoid the major
shortcomings of the past cost-plus



- 9 -
system (such as over-investment, low use of installed capacities,
and lack of incentives to control production costs and energy use),
and will allow the enterprises to adjust prices unilaterally by
reference to world prices. In the few cases of goods where the
domestic price is below the world price (medical products
essentially), the Government will authorize annual price increases
sufficient to reach by the expected date of liberalization the
level of the world price of these goods. Thus, prices would become
more market-oriented;
(vii)     Investment Policies:  The new Investment Law of August 1987,
foresees the full decontrol of all investments. Government
approval will be limited to the granting of a number of special
investment incentives. However, these will be available only to a
restricted number of high priority projects; particularly,
agriculture, export industries and investments creating employment
in the most underdeveloped areas of the country; and
(viii)     Import Policies:  In this respect, the Government has taken
decisions on two sets of measures:
(a)       the gradual phasing out, from early 1987 to 1990, of all
quantitative restrictions on imports; and
(b)       a reform of the tariff system (including the reduction of
high import tariffs and disparities in the levels of
effective protection between the different sectors of the
economy) which aims to achieve a lower and reasonably
uniform effective protection rate of about 251 by the end
of the VIIth Plan.
c. The Industrial and Trade Policy Adjustment ProWran
2.17     While the macro-economic adjustment program is essential to the
creation of an overall economic climate conducive to more efficient growth, a
wide range of sectoral measures is also needed to complement and reinforce
this program. These measures would have three specific objectives:
(i) to stimulate growth of manufacturing production, in the
short-term, through economically efficient use of existing
installations and, in the longer term, through an increased role
of the private sector in investment;
(ii)  to stimulate exports of manufactured products; and
(iii)  to stimulate creation of employment in manufacturing industries.
The Government has now adopted a Medium-Term Industrial and Trade
Adjustment Program (MITAP), the content of which is presented below.



- 10 -
I.  The New Investment Law.  The new law brings about six important changes:
(i) All investment control and licensing are abolished. No prior
investment authorization will be required -- only a simple
declaration, for statistical purposes;
(ii) Only a limited number of investments, considered particularly
important to the economic and social development of the country,
will be eligible to receive -pecial investment incentives after
approval by the Investment Incentives Approval Committee, the
secretariat of which will be provided by Agence de Promotion de
l'Industrie (API). They will apply only to enterprises exporting
part of their output, in agriculture, creating new jobs in certain
priority areas of the country, or introducing new technologies;
(iii) Special incentives are to be granted automatically, provided
specified criteria are met. The two main criteria -- exports and
location -- are clear 'ut.  Only the relatively minor incentives
for the acquisition and adaptation of new technologies are based
on an approval process involving a judgemental element;
(iv)  The incentives will no longer make any distinction between
projects of different sizes, nor among new, extension or
replaZement investments; thus, small and replacement investments
will no longer be discriminated against;
(v) The new incentives will be much less generous than under the
previous law, as some major incentives are being withdrawn. In
particular, only off-shore enterprises exporting all their oucput
(and covered by Law 85-14) will continue to benefit from lower
tariffs and lower turnover taxes on capital goods imports. Thus,
the bias in tariff exemptions against labor-intensive projects has
been removed; and
(vi) All incentives, apart from a few designed to encourage export
operations and multi-shift production, are temporary in nature;
they are either linked to the act of investing, or extend over a
maximum of six years.
II. Government Support and Regulatory Institutions. The main institutional
improvements to be achieved through MITAP are: (i) merging three institutions
- the old API (Agence de Promotion des Investissements), AFI (Industrial
Estates Agency) and CNEI (National Center for Industrial Studies) responsible
for industrial promotion, industrial estates and feasibility studies,
respectively - into a single institution (the new API, Agence de Promotion de
l'Industrie; see Chapter III, Section B); (ii) merging two Government
institutions, CEPEX (Export Promotion Center) and OCT (Tunisia Trade Office),
both responsible for export promotion, into a single one with increasing
orientation towards the private sector; and (iii) making the technical centers
(responsible for technical assistance to EMI, lea*her and building material
enterprises) more self supporting and more directly responsive to the private



- 11 -
-ector. It is expected that all these institutions will strengthen their
promotional activities, now that most of their regulatory actidties have been
abolished.
III. Export Promotion. The main measures concern the customr. and indirect
taxation systems, including temporary admission and warehousing, and include:
(i) Reducing all customs forms required for export to a single one,
and -- more generally -- simplifying and computerizing procedures;
(ii) Ratifying the treaty on international road transport (TIR) customs
procedures, thus integrating Tunisian road transport into the EEC
transport system;
(iii) Reducing -- from 100 percent to 5 percent - the bank guarantee
required for imported goods to be used in exports, and abolishing
the guarantee in case of permanent or intermittent supervision of
operations by the customs administration;
(iv) Permitting occasional exporters to supply themselves from resident
companies without payment of the domestic sales tax, instead of
reimbursing this tax after export;
(v) Abolishing the import licensing document (titre de commerce
exterieur) for imports under the temporary admission regime,
including imports of packaging materials for exports; tnd
(vi) Improving the processing of the reimbursement of taxes on imported
export inputs.
IV. Money and Credit: Besides the measures agreed within the macro-economic
package (para. 2.16) and those agreed with the IMF in the context of the
Stand-by Agreement (October 1986), two additional liberalization measures were
agreed as part of MITAP. First; the prior authorization requirement from the
Central Bank for commercial bank lending to industrial enterprises was raised
further in January 1987 to TD 5 million (except for "overdraft" borrowings in
the trading sector where a limit of TD 500,000 million remains). Thus the
system has been made considerably simpler and less cumbersome; the TD 5
million ceiling now affects only about 50 enterprises, mostly from the public
sector, whose situation still requires monitorir,g. The 1-w private
enterprises still affected by this requirement will no longer be subject to it
after January 1, 1988. The Governement has clearly stated its intention to
remove the system of prior authorizations. Second; in the past, the
commercial banks had to earmark a large proportion of their deposits (except
for foreign accounts) to medium and long-term lending operations.  This
proportion- eventually totalled 432: 201 in development bonds issued by the
State, 52 in bonds of the Caisse Nationale d'Eargne-logement (CNEL), and 182
in medium-term loans to industrial enterprises-'. The objective of the 182
ratio was to get the banks to
1/ In French, "Ratio Global de Financement du Developpement" (RGFD).
21/ In French, "Ratio d'Effets Prives a Moyen Terme" (REPMT).



- 12 -
participate more actively in investment financing, which may have been
justified at a time when the institutions catering to such lending were not
sufficiently developed. When banks did not comply with the ratio, they had to
maintain equivalent interest free balances with the Central Bank. With the
creation of a large number of development banks since 1981, it is less
essential to maintain such a high and undifferentiated lending ratio.
Accordingiy, it was replaced on September 30, 1986 by a lower and more
specific ratio, known as the "priority activities ratio", which applies only
to the financing of investment in the crafts/ artisan sector and for SMI,
agriculture and export activities. Initially, the new ratio is fixed at 71 of
deposits; it will rise by one point per semester to reach its final level of
10% by March 31, 1988. The Government has also agreed to etudy the reform of
the Foreign Exchange Risk Coverage scheme for long-term lending through the
banking system, with the medium-term objective of having the ultimate
borrowers assume the foreign exchange risk on loans from abroad. The adoption
of an improved foreign exchange risk coverage scheme is a condition for second
tranche release of ITPAL.
V. Industrial Employment. In addition to the measures affecting employment
and wages that are part of the macro-economic framework, MITAP would support
the following:
(i)    In an effort to prevent any further increases in social security
charges, the Government will study the feasibility of reallocating
the total revenues of six social programs so as to maintain their
longer term overall equilibrium, and will review the structure of
the various benefits being provided under these programs;
(ii)   Helping enterprises implement the policy of basing wage
adjustments oni changes in productivity and the financial condition
of the enterprise, is a priority task that the Government would
like to see followed on a wider scale. The practical application
of such a policy requires the assistance of experts which the Bank
has agreed to finance; and
(iii)  As part of the efforts to prepare the Seventh Plan, the Government
is undertaking a review of labor and employment legislation to
ensure that it is sufficiently flexible to promote employment, it
incites entrepreneurs to hire more staff, and -- at the same
time -- it is not an obstacle to enterprise rehabil tion and
restructuring efforts.
C. Bank StrateEy in the Manufacturing Sector
2.18     The Bank's lending ami ESW strategy in the sector aims at supporting
the country's transition from a petroleum/phosphate-based economy to a more
sectorally balanced and efficient one, while taking measures to increase
employment and to target development to low-income areas. In support of this,
the objective of Bank lending is to emphasize projects which have a direct and
rapid impact on production, employment and export, and which minimize
Government budget contributions. The Bank is encouraging the



- 13 -
development of the industrial sector, through credit lines with special focus
such as the First Small-Scale Industries Loan (Loan 1969-TUN), Export
Industries (Loan 2522-TUN', Electro-Mechanical Industries (Loan 2554-TUN) and
through Industrial and Trade Policy Adjustment Loans (ITPAL; Loan 2781-TUN).
Operations in the Export, SSI and EMI sectors as well as sector policy lending
are intended to bring about the afore-mentioned transition. The Financial
Sector Review, the Employment Study, the Industrial Sector Review and the
planned Public Sector Enterprises Study (1987) provide the analytical base for
recommending appropriate government policies and supporting the Bank's
operations in the sector.
Im. THE SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE INDUSTRY SUBSECTOR
A. Characteristics and Performance
3.01     Tunisia has a relatively high share of small and medium industrial
enterprises which are generally defined!' as units with total investment,
including working capital, of less than TD 1 millionA' (US$1.255 million)
and employing more than ten workers ". Like in other Mediterranean
countries, the SMI sector in Tunisia is composed of a mixture of traditional
workshops, artisanal production units and small modern factories. Even though
figures are not collected in a systematic manner, it is estimated (on the
basis of approvals by API) that SMI enterprises comprise over 801 of all
manufacturing enterprises and over 65 of employment created in manufacturing
(i.e. excluding services, mining, tourism, energy and transport). During the
period 1980-85, the number of projects approved by API in the SMI and the
manufacturing sectors, and the estimated investment and created employment
were the following:

and fiscal incentives are based on a maximum amount of investment, the
Statistical Office uses the number of employees (10-50).
2/ Until late September 1987, this ceiling was set at TD 500,000.
3/ For enterprises with less than 10 workers, no license is required; they
are called "artisans" or cottage industry. For enterprises with at least
10 workers and with total investment of less than TD 500,000, a license is
required; they are defined as SMI.

contributing more to exports, both directly and indirectly. The dominant
sectors are textile/leather (about 40S), food processing (16%), and EMI
(14%). In general, the geographical distribution of SMI follows the si.me
pattern as the larger units, with a majority concentrated in the Greater Tunis
area and the major coastal cities (e.g. Sfax, Sousse, Bizerte). In 1985, SMI
investments accounted for 33% of total industrial investment; the cost of
creating a new job averaged TD 8,500 (about US$11,000 at the then prevailing
exchange rate), i.e. less than 40% of the average experienced in all
manufacturing (about TD 22,000) or about 17% of the average cost for larger
manufacturing enterprises (about TD 50,000). This amount, however, varied
from TD 3,000 in traditional firms, to TD 25,000 in modern enterprises.
3.03     Based on the API's 1985 approvals, as shown in the table below, the
food processing and textiles/leathers subsectors represented 59% of SMI total
employment and 46% of SMI total investment.

SMIs are particularly predominant in textiles and leather, in which they
accounted for 34% of the total manufacturing employment while requiring only
81 of total investment. This is mainly due to the fact that SMIs are
concentrated in the garment and confection production, while the larger units
are in spinning and weaving which is much more capital intensive and has more
opportunity for economies of scale.
3.04     The above analysis illustrates the importance of SMI for employment
creation and its dynamic role in the manufacturing sector; particularly, with
regards to creating large numbers of new projects and jobs through relatively
small investments. They are expected to be even more important in the future,
as the Government reduces its direct involvement in the industrial sector.
Deepening, strengthening and enlarging the SMI sector is the main objective of
the proposed Bank project.
B. Institutional Framework and Incentives
3.05     There is no single specialized agency directly responsible for SMI
assistance and promotion, but a number of organizations are indirectly
involved. Overall direct Government assistance to private industry has been



- 15 -
mainly to SMI. Thus, even though several institutions were established to
help private enterprises in general (i.e. large and small), in practice they
were oriented essentially to relatively small enterprises and entrepreneurs.
The above mentioned institutions are presented below.
(i) Agence de Promotion de l'Industrie (API)
3.06     In 1973, Agence de Promotion des Investissements (old API) was
established (Law 72-38 of April 27, 1972) with the dual responsibility of:
(i) providing information on industrial opportunities, assisting promoters to
identify projects and, in general, helping entrepreneurs with the appraisal
and operation of their projects, and (ii) licensing all enterprises over 10
persons and approving all investments under the investments laws (Law 72-38 of
April 1972, revis-d in 1985 with regard to off-shore export companies; and law
81-56 of June 23, 1981 concerning manufacturing industries, in general, and
decentralization, in particular). API's Board was a large body with 15
permanent members (all Government officials) and a dozen observers from
government agencies, the majority political party, technical centers and UTICA
(paras 3.10 and 3.11). As of December 31, 1986, API had about 360 employees
including those in regional offices.
3.07     In 1978, API started developing extension services to SMI. These were
carried out by a Special Assistance Unit and included: (i) assistance in the
preparation of projects; (ii) help in obtaining public utility services; and
(iii) assistance in overcoming administrative procedures. To ensure the proper
implementation of the SSI project (loan 1969-TUN) the Bank utilized API's
Special Assistance Unit for (i) administrating the loan, (ii) providing
technical assistance in preparation of small projects for API's approval,
(iii) providing extension services, and (iv) reviewing subproject appraisal
reports. The Unit was staffed by six professionals, including a foreign
expert financed by the Bank under the SSI project. As discussed below (paras.
3.28 - 3.30), API's assistance to SMI has not been very effective and the
level of effort has not been commensurate with the size of the sector.
3.08     In the past, API's approval was required for the enterprises to
receive financial assistance from the banks and FOPRODI (paras 4.11 - 4.15)
and to obtain a license for imported equipment. Therefore, all entrepreneurs
at one time or another had to deal with API. This situation has now changed
with the abolition of investment and import licenses as agreed under ITPAL.
3.09     As agreed under ITPAL (para. 2.17, II), API has now been merged with
A"I (Agency for Industrial Estates) and CNEI (Industrial Studies Center), into
a single organization responsible for the promotion of industrial development,
called Agence de Promotion de l'Industrie (new API). The new API would
essentially be an institution to carry out studies, advise the Government on
industrial policy, and help implement this policy and monitor its effect; the
new API would have no control or regulatory power. (Also, it would not
provide directrindividual assistance to SMI anymore; this would now be carried
out by UTICA). CNEI, which has been supported by the Bank (T.A. Project:
Loan 2197-TUN), used to undertake sector studies and provide independent
advice to the Government on industrial problems. Frequent changes in
management have left the center somewhat disoriented; it has competent staff,
however, and - with proper direction -- should be able to make a positive



- 16 -
contribution to the new API (particularly, in fields buch as market and sector
studies, economic analysis of projects, evaluation of feasibility studies).
AFI used to be responsible for industrial estate development and was fairly
effective and successfull. Industrial estates have so far mostly benefitted
large and medium-sized industry. This is not necessarily a shortcoming
because SMI generally develop near the larger industrial enterprises. The
integration of the three institutions (old API, AFI and CNEI) is expected to
lead to better assistance to the industrial sector, in general, and SMI in
particular. Under the proposed project, the new API will receive technical
assistance to better perform its promotional role (para 3.31). This support
will be supplemented by assistance to other organizations (UTICA and
commercial banks). Details on staffing, organization, objectives and
procedures are provided in Annex 1.
(ii) Union Tunisienne de l'Industrie. du Commerce et de l'Artisanat (UTICA)
3.10     Created in 1946, UTICA is the federation of Tunisian employers; it
promotes the interests of the business community. It is divided into sectoral
groups . Its main function is to improve the contacts of the business
community with the Government and to give its view on questions of industrial
policy and reglementation. In addition, it has two others functions: (i)
information and publications; and (ii) promotion and training.
3.11     In 1984, UTICA created an Assistance Unit for SMI (Centre
d'Assistance a la PME), which started an experimental program financed by
USAID and assisted by CRS (Catholic Relief Services). This two-year program,
to help about 60 hand-picked very small (less than 20 employees) enterprises,
consisted of three phases: diagnosis of the firm's problems, design of
possible solutions, and implementation of the solution adopted. The program
was successfully completed in 1986 and UTICA, USAID and CRS have decided to
extend and enlarge the program for another two years, to cover about 200
enterprises by the end of the period. Under the new program, five permanent
advisors will provide technical and managerial assistance to very small
enterprises. However, there is a growing need of consulting services for
other small as well as for medium-scale entrepreneurs who have asked UTICA to
extend its assitance services. Under the proposed project, the 'Bank will work
as a catalyst in establishing with bilateral donors, a more comprehensive
program to assist UTICA in helping entrepreneurs improve their efficiency and
productivity as well as undertake additional investments (see paras 3.16 -
3.20). Details concerning UTICA are provided in Annex 1.
(iii) Technical Centers.
3.12     Three technical centers have been created so far by the Government to
provide information, training and production assistance to enterprises in
electrical/mechanical industries (Centre Technique des Industries Mecaniques
et Electriques; CETIME), leather and footwear (Centre National du Cuir et de
la Chaussure; CNCC), and building materials, ceramics and glass (Centre
Technique des Materiaux de Construction, de la Ceramique et du Verre;
(CTMCCV). The technical centers provide their assistance mainly to the medium
and small-scale industries because the large enterprises are generally



- 17 -
well equipped. CETIME, which was created in 1982 with the help of the Bank
(EMI-I Project, Loan 2113-TUN), received in 1985 an additional US$2.1 million
from the Bank under the EMI-II Project (Loan 2554-TUN), to expand its
activities into foundry and electronics. The technical centers are non-profit
enterprises that operate on the basis of approved budgets, which are partly
financed by revenues from services sold to industrial enterprises. (CETIME,
in particular, is well equipped, has a competent staff and benefits from
technical assistance from the UNDP and bilateral sources). However, not
unlike many other public institutions in Tunisia, the technical centers have
occasional tendencies to become regulatory and bureaucratic, instead of
promotional. Increased input from the private sector and reduced Government
intervention may in the future secure a proper balance. The future role,
scope and development of the centers is being studied in the context of the
overall framework of industrial promotion (i.e. not limited to SMI) and is
being addressed under ITPAL (para 2.17, II). Although the proposed project
does not directly include assistance to the technical centers, both API and
UTICA will closely cooperate with them. Additional information on the three
technical centers is provided in Annex 1.
(iv) Incentives.
3.13     There are very few SMI-specific incentives.  In fact, corporate tax
allowances, import duty exemptions, employment creation premiums and interest
rate subsidies have generally been industry-wide and not related to the size
of the enterprise. It has been, however, the Government's belief that SMI are
more flexible in the choice of their location and that they can be
instrumental in helping achieve regional development. Until early 1987, a
preferential low interest rate (6.25%) was applied to loans to SMIs
established in less developed regionsl-.  Under ITPAL, all SMI specific
incentives have been abolished except for a preferential interest rate on
medium-term loans (up to seven years) under FOPRODI (Fonds de Promotion et de
Dicentralisation Industrielles), which combines in a single scheme regional
decentralization and SMI promotion.  Chapter IV (Financing of the SMI
subsector) gives a description of FOPRODI.
C. MAIN CONSTRAINTS TO SMI DEVELOPMENT
3.14     Macroeconomic and industrial sector constraints are being addressed
under ITPAL and have been discussed in paras. 2.16 and 2.17. The subsector
specific constraints are of two kinds: one set of constraints is related to
the subsector in general (production, management and finance) and is rather
similar to the constraints found in other countries; the other set is country
and project specific (institutions, regulations, definitions and criteria for
special treatment). Below follows a discussion of the constraints and the
recommendations proposed to overcome them.
1/       Until January 1987, for SMI projects under TD 500,000, rates for
medium-term loans were 6.252 in less developed regions and 8Z in
already developed areas (i.e. Tunis, Sfax). Since January 1987, only
an 81 rate has been retained; and, since late September 1987, the TD
500,000 ceiling has been raised to TD 1,000,000.



- 18 -
(i) Production and Management Constraints
3.15     SMI productivity is affected by internal problems such as:  deficient
production planning, accounting and management, poor product design and plant
layout, inappropriate selection of equipment and lack of quality control. SMI
growth is also constrained because they suffer from shortage of raw materials
(e.g. delivery delays, unfavorable prices), and limited marketing capabilities
(e.g. limited size of domestic market, lack of export outlets, and dependence
on several intermediaries, resulting in higher costs). Because development
policies have favored creation and investment -- rather than production and
selling -- managerial, productivity and marketing services are generally not
available to SMI.  In addition, the majority of SMI promoters are not aware
that they need or would benefit from assistance. These constraints to SMI
development can only be removed by a more focused program of technical
assistance to SMIs which, under the proposed project, would be provided for
through UTICA.
3.16     UTICA will provide two forms of services to enterprises: (i)
diagnostic assessment of overall operations; and (ii) specific analysis of
particular problems. The assessment of overall operations, will consist in a
general diagnosis by a multidisciplinary team (production engineer, market
specialist, financial analyst, etc.) and will be completed by an action plan
and by follow-ups to help the promoter implement the proposed solutions.
About 1.5 staff months per enterprise will be necessary to complete an overall
assessment. The analysis of particular problems will consist of advice and
occasional technical assistance from specialists in studies of new products
and markets, improvement of productivity, feasibility studies and financial
planning. Consulting services would be extended to all SMIs across the
country, from two centers; the first one located in Tunis, and the second one,
starting in 1989, in Sfax.
3.17     UTICA will deliver its technical assistance through its SMI
Assistance Center.  The Center's goal -- with assistance from both local and
international experts and consultants -- would be to train 20 Tunisian
nationals as full-time advisers who would then work with about 300 enterprises
over the three years from 1987 to 1990. By the time project implementation is
completed, the SMI Assistance Unit should be operating independently. UTICA
will train its advisers in the main problem areas affecting SMI enterprises:
accounting and finance (e.g. cost accounting, financial planning), production
management (e.g., production planning, scheduling, inventory control),
administration, organization, personnel management and marketing (e.g.,
advertising, pricing, distribution networks and market research). UTICA
intends to merge the USAID and CRS program with the Bank program at the end of
the third year; in the. meantime, the two programs will have the same project
chief and will share all documentation.
3.18     A technical assistance program has been designed to strengthen UTICA;
the program would consist of the following elements (for details, see Annex 4):
(a)    two international experts (a specialist in management of SMI, and a
multidisciplinary engineer specialized in production and
organization);



- 19 -
(b)    occasional international consultants/specialists in technologies that
are either new or not yet available in Tunisia, and specialists in
external markets;
(c)    occasional local consultants (technical centers, CEPEX, private
consulting firms, etc.), commissioned to work in conjunction with the
project advisers;
(d)    overseas training and internships for UTICA staff; and
(e)    equipment, and reference information.
3.19     The foreign exchange cost of this project component is estimated at
about US$1.3 million for the 1987-1990 period. The local currency needs of
UTICA to implement the project component and meet its operating costs are
estimated at TD 485.500 in constant 1986 prices, after deduction of income
received for its services (about TD 75,000).

2/ Contingencies for local costs will be charged as fees, if needed.
3.20      For the next three years, UTICA will make its services available at
very low cost: diagnostic services will essentially be free, while the design
of action plans and the implementation follow-ups will be charged at an average
cost of TD 250. At the end of the period, it is expected that the local staff
will be able to continue the program without further assistance from abroad and
that fee income will be sufficient to pay for the operating cost of the program.
(ii)      Financial Constraints
3.21      Insufficient Commercial Banks' Interest In SMI Investment Financing.
The main concern of commercial banks under the SSI project (Loan 1969-TUN) was
that margins were insufficient (only 2X on average) to permit adequate
financial services to their customers, cover the risks associated with



- 20 -
SSI projects and provide them a reasonable profit. Consequently, medium- and
long-term credit units in commercial banks were understaffed and underequipped.
Another concern was that the subloans financed by the project were not accounted
for in meeting the 182 medium-term lending ratio (para 2.17 (IV)).
Nevertheless, the Bank loan has been utilized because, first, the Bank loan was
considered less risky by the participating banks since the Bank's funds were
managed at a fee and the FNG1' carried the bulk of the risk. Second, since
early 1985, the Bank loan had practically become the only available source for
investment financing because of tight liquidityl' and restricted possibilities
to use local currency loans for the import of equipment.
3.22      The proposed project would make the financing of SMI more attractive
by providing better margins. The banks would no longer receive a management fee
for an essentially low risk operation; instead, they would receive an adequate
margin and assume the full credit risk on the loans made from the Bank loan.
The margin permitted under the project would not exceed 4 %, which should be
sufficient to cover the cost of project appraisal and supervision and to make
provisions for the higher risks. As explained in para. 2.17 (IV), the
medium-term lending ratio has been reduced from 18 2 to 10 2 and will basically
be reserved for small industrial and agricultural enterprises and export
operations; loans financed from the Bank funds would be included in the ratio.
3.23      Undercapitalization and Insufficient Equity.  The investment code
(Art. 8, Law 81-56 of June 23, 1981) requires that project promoters provide 30%
of the investment cost from their own funds. A 30% equity contribution can be
considered relatively small. However, sponsors tend to underestimate the total
cost of their project in order to limit their contribution; frequently, as a
result, when a project is completed, the promoter has no resources left because
the cost overrun on the project had to be financed from his own resources.
Expansion, modernization and rehabilitation investments are also adversely
affected by this requirement because API used to consider that such investments
also had to be covered for 30 % at least by self-financing, irrespective of the
current value of the enterprise's equity. Thus, an entrepreneur who had repaid
most or all of his loans and had built up a substantial equity in his company
could not obtain a new loan for an expansion unless he provided again 302 of the
project cost from his own funds. The consequence of this requirement was that
it was better not to channel profits back into an existing company (and reduce
the debt/equity ratio), and to keep the profits out of the company so that they
could be used for a new project. From now on, as agreed under ITPAL, API will
not be responsible anymore for approving the financial plans of investment
projects; this will now be the responsibility of the commercial banks who will
carry the risk (and not simply manage for a fee, as in the past). Generally
accepted banking criteria of debt/equity, debt service capacity, overall project
profitability and creditworthiness will determine the appropriateness of the
financial arrangement being envisaged.

2/ The utilization of the Bank loan increased the bank's rediscount oinota by
a similar amount.



- 21 -
3.24     Difficulties in Financing Cost Overruns and Delays.  In order te benefit
from incentives for SMI and to stay within the TD 1,000.000 limit '', sponsors
often do not include provisions for cost overruns or price increases, and expect
that cash flows in the early years will finance part or all of the working
capital. As a result, cost overruns frequently exhaust the savings held by small
investors. Since commercial banks from now on will be responsible for approving
overall financial plans of SMI projects, the proper staffing of their term
lending departments will become essential; it should ensure more sophisticated
project appraisal and supervision, and should diminish the risk of project
underfinancing (para. 3.27).
3.25     Inferences from visits to enterprises and API's knowledge of the sector
indicate that a crucial problem is the lack of resources for financing working
capital. The banking system is reluctant to finance new SMI enterprises because
of insufficient financial reward, relative to the cost and risk of SMI projects.
However, entrepreneurs have indicated thaqt the ready availability of funds was
more important to them than the interest rate on these funds.
3.26     The proposed project is expected to overcome these problems by allowing
sufficient margins on term lending by the banks; this will make this type of
lending more attractive to the banks and encourage them to be more responsive to
SMI customers. Thio is also expected to reduce the banks' reluctance to meet
2/
permanent working capital needs when extending long-term loans-
3.27     Commercial banks selected to participate in the project would organize,
staff and equip themselves to properly appraise and implement projects financed
by term loans. The participating commercial banks have made satisfactory
proposals to strengthen their term lending organizations, to which they will
allocate sufficient and competent staff. They will rely on outside services
(including API) where needed. Training programs have also been formulated.
Resources to finance these actions will come from the improved margins on
term-lending and from the following two fiscal provisions: first, the
possibility to apply directly up to TD30,000 of the cost of studies for tax
deduction (Law 80-59); and, second, the possibility to get an exemption from the
vocational training tax by using 2 Z of paid salaries and wages for training.
These two provisions would provide enough to cover the expected cost of a program
(estimated at about TD 50,000 per bank and per year), which would include
consultant costs for project studies, as well as cost of training, internships,
seminars and study aids. During negotiations, these proposals were confirmed by
the participating banks.
1/ see para. 3.33
2/ Workiaig capital financing to profitable and proven companies is less risky
and less costly, and thus more profitable.



- 22 -
(iii)    Institutional and Regulatory Constraints
3.28     Lack of Appropriate Institutional Support.  In the last few years,
SMI promoters have not received adequate extension and management support,
because, over the years, API had developed into a regulatory agency which
spent most of its time reviewing and approving investment proposals, instead
of fulfilling its promotional and assistance roles. In this context, the
Special Assistance Unit, which helped SMI projects, had mainly provided
administrative advice and information, since its staff had neither the
qualification nor the experience needed to provide tecbnical and managerial
assistance to SMI. Supervision of the implementation of SMI projects, which
was handled by API's regional offices, was not properly carried out because
each agent had to supervise a  u,t 300 projects per year.  Consequently,
supervision was limited to gat..aring statistics and general progress data.
3.29     Under the SSI Loan (1969-TUN), the Bank financed an expert who was
*esponsible for reviewing appraisal reports and giving engineering assistance
during the preparation of appraisal reports. The expert assisted a large
number of projects (about 80 per year), and sample checks indicate that the
expert's advice was beneficial to project sponsors and to participating
banks. However, the expert was not able to assist all promotors who requested
his advice, and assistance was not given at the implementation and operational
stages, which is crucial for SMI projects. Under the proposed project,
technical and managerial services would be provided by UTICA, while API would
only assist in the preparation of new SMI projects.
3.30     The new Investment Law, made effective in August 1987, requires API
to take on a full-scale promotional role and abandon its present regulatory
and controlling role. This means that API staff and financial resources will
be channeled into promoting new enterprises, mainly through project
identification work and sector studies. Under the proposed project, API's
role would be:
(a)  to assist promoters in the identification of project opportunities
and in the formulation of their projects;
(b)  to provide training for the staff of the SMI unit responsible for
promotional work, and to prepare model feasibility reports for
possible SMI projects;
(c)  to provide the participating banks -  at their request -- with advice
regarding the economic feasibility (studies of economic rate of
return, market and product studies, etc.) of projects to be financed
from the Bank line of credit;
(d)  to collect and analyze all information on SMIs of interest to the
Government, supervisory institutions and lenders; and



- 23 -
(e) to provide agencies concerned with the sector, with information on
macroeconomic matters and regulatory questions.
3.31     To assist API in performing its role, a technical assistance program
has been designed which is described in detail in Annex 3.  The main elements
of this program are: (i) 24 staff months of expert assistance (at a foreign
exchange cost of about US$8,300/month) to help SMI project sponsors in the
preparation of project technical feasibility studies; (ii) 2 staff months of
short-term consultants' assistance (at a foreign exchange cost of
US$10,000/month) for market studies, subcontracting, promotional work and
engineering services (new products or technology); (iii) training for API's
staff; and (iv) and equipment for information services. The total foreign
exchange cost of the program is estimated at US$500,000, which would be
financed by the proposed Bank loan. (Office space, supplies and other local
costs, estimated at about US$125,000 equivalent, would be financed by API).

-   Fellowships and study tours for API staff                      30,000

Total                                           US_500,000
The employment of the expert would be a condition of loan disbursement for
this technical assistance component. The expert and short-term consultants
will be hired in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.
3.32     The Definition of SMI Proiects.  In the past, SMI have been limited
to projects with a total investment of less than TD 500,000, including
permanent working capital requirements. This definition applied to the Bank
SSI project as well as for obtaining incentives and assistance under the
FOPRODI scheme (see para 4.11). The investment ceiling -- which dated from
1975, when TD 500,000 was equivalent to US$1,250,000 -- is no longer
appropriate, not only because the present value of the dinar has substantially
decreased (i.e. TD 1 = US$1.255 now, versus TD 1 = US$2.50 in 1981 at the time
of the SSI project appraisal), but also because a tendency developed to try to
fit too many projects in the SSI category, which resulted in the
underestimation of project investment costs.

3.33     In late September 1987, the SMI investment ceiling was raised to TD
1,000,000. Under the proposed project, the investment ceiling would be
somewhat higher in order to include in the financing plans adequate provisions
for working capital and contingencies, and to reflect the present costs of
equipment and building. It is also proposed to have two ceilings: one for
new projects, TD 1.5 million; and another one for existing enterprises, TD 2.5
million. In the past, it was fiscally more advantageous to create a new
enterprise (with new equipment and new buildings) than to renovate, expand,
modernize or integrate existing enterprises; because, under the old investment
code, only new enterprises qualified for benefits and incentives. Under ITPAL
(para. 2.17 I), the emphasis is placed on better use of equipment and
capacity, improving labor productivity (by introducing two shifts, for
example) and decreasing investment subsidies. The proposed ceiling of TD 2.5
million for expansion projects (including net existing assets) would enable
the financing of the expansion of successful SMI enterprises.
3.34     The Investment Per Job Ceiling.  This ceiling, which was among the
eligibility criteria under the SSI Bank loan, was originally set at TD 6,900
(US$ 17,250 at the exchange rate prevailing in 1981). It was increased to TD
15t000 (US$ 20,500) in January 1984 and to TD 18,500 (US$22,000) in October
1985. In order to comply with the maximum investment per job criterion,
promoters, API and commercial banks have sometimes inflated the expected job
creation. In many cases, this ceiling has also aggravated the problem of
total investments because it gives further inducement to decrease the
estimated total project cost. Earlier limits appear to have contributed to
the slow utilization of the loan; the present limit, however, seems to be
appropriate. Under the project, it is proposed that the maximum amount of
investment per job created be used as a guiding and flexible criterion. This
amount would be TD 30,000 in December 1987 terms; this amount should enable
the financing of existing projects that need additional investments to make
them more effici.ent or productive, without necessarily creating more
employment (see para. 5.10).
D. The Bank's Role in the SMI Subsector
3.35     Pilot Proiect.  In 1977, the Bank extended a pilot line of credit of
US$7 million to finance SSI projects. The project was administered by BDET,
which reviewed projects for Bank financing and coordinated the utilization of
the loan by participating commercial banks. The loan main objectives were to
help the creation of new enterprises, to create employment at low investment
cost, and to initiate project lending by the commercial banks.
3.36     The SSI pilot line contributed to the financing of 37 projects (11
from the SSI component of Loan 1504-TUN, and 26 from Loan 1505-TUN ) of which
26 were financed by BDET'', 7 by BNT, 3 by STB, and 1 by BTEI.  Of the 37
projects financed, about 701 were new operations and the remaining 30b
i
1/ Of the US$7 million, US$2 million was reserved for BDET to finance the
extension of existing SSI projects (Loan 1504-TUN); US$5 million was lent
to the government for utilization by the commercial banks and BDET to
finance new SSI projects (Loan 1505-TUN).



- 25 -
extensions of existing enterprises. The main subsectors were: construction
materials (272), plastic, wood and paper (27%), textiles, clothing and leather
(24%), food and beverage (112), and FMI (11%). As for the regional
distribution, 65% of subprojects financed were located outside the Greater
Tunis area. Of the 26 subprojects financed under Loan 1505-TUN, 24 were
FOPRODI assisted. The 37 subprojects generated 1,260 jobs, at an average cost
per job, in 1976 prices, of TD 4,165 -- compared with the TD 4,600 amount
covenanted. The lowest cost per job created was TD 2,000.
3.37     The pilot project achieved to a large degree the sectoral,
institutional and operational objectives set at the time of appraisal. It
constituted a major source of finance for econoxically viable enterprises, and
it supported the creation or expansion of labor-intensive enterprises in
various industrial subsectors. This confirmed the Government's perception
that SSIs were a good vehicle for economic development and job creation.
3.38     The Small Scale Industry Project (Loan 1969-TUN).  This project,
approved in April 1981, built on the experience gained under the pilot
project. In order to ensure more active participation from the commercial
banks, which had shown reluctance to work under BDET's supervision, the tasks
of administering and technically supervising the loan were given to the
Central Bank and API, respectively. To make the utilization of the loan more
attractive, a commission system was adopted to remunerate the participating
banks for the appraisal and collection of loans. Also, the risk sharing was
changed, by shifting a larger burden onto the National Guarantee Fund (FNG;
paras 4.16 and 4.17).
3.39     Commitments under the loan were initially very slow.  The main
problems were the cumbersome disbursement procedures and the unduly rigid
project selection criteria. The disbursement problem was resolved by setting
up a special account in the Central Bank, which overcame the participating
banks' reluctance to pre-finance subloans. The maximum amount of investment
per job created was initially too low and this was aggravated by the
depreciation of the dinar. The Bank adjusted this criterion in steps (para.
3.34) and, as of September 30, 1987, almost all the loan amount had been
committed (US$28.8 million-L, out of US$30 million). In total, 142 projects
were approved, of which 24.11 were in the EMI sector, 19.3% in textiles and
leather, 15.2% in construction materials, 13.51 in wood, paper and plastic,
13.31 in food processing and 8.01 in miscellaneous industries.
Almost all projects were creations (only 52 of commitments were for extension
projects) and 641 of the projects benefited from FOPRODI assistance. The most
active banks were Banque du Sud (191 of total commitments), STB (171), BNT
(172) and UIB (131). BDET accounted for 121, while BIAT and BT accounted for
71 each, and UBCI and CFCT for 41 each (see Annex 2 for details).

3.40     Through the two previous projects, the Bank has learned about the
constraints affecting the development of the SMI subsector. The Project
Completion Report and the Project Performance Audit Report on Loans
1504/1505-TUN identified some of the constraints mentioned in paras. 3.14 -
3.33, and suggested solutions which have been taken into account in the design
of the proposed project. The improvements required in the macro-framework and
the overall manufacturing sector which were eventually addressed by ITPAL,
were identified through the regular supervision of the two loans to the SSI
sector, as well as the supervision of other loans to industry, whether through
the development banks or directly to such enterprises as Sofomeca (foundry)
and Sogitex (textile). Given that the Bank loans were practically the only
source of long-term financing to SMI by the commercial banks"' (with the
exception of a limited number of suppliers credits), the Bank has played an
important role in the development of SMI.
IV. FINANCING OF THE SMI SUBSECTOR
A. The Financial Sector
4.01 Overview. The Bank undertook in 1985 a comprehensive review of
Tunisia's financial sector (Report No. 5263-TUN, December 16, 1985). The
financial system in Tunisia consists of the Central Bank, ten commercial
banks, ten investment banks, two savings institutions, one leasing company
(Tunisie Leasing), and eight portfo.io management companies. The postal
checking system, the stock exchange and seven off-shore banks complement the
financial system. Considering the size of the country (about 7.5 million
inhabitants) and its stage of development, this is a rather large financial
sector. It should be mentioned, however, that the Central Bank, up to very
recently, exercised very close direct controls over all aspects of credit to
the economy -- in most cases, requiring prior approval. Under ITPAL and the
IMF Stand-by Agreement, the Central Bank has agreed to liberalize its overall
quantitative and q.azlttative controls and to rely less on direct intervention
(see paras. 2.16, (i l) and (iv), and 2.17 IV). The objective of this new
policy is to give the commercial banks more freedom in credit decisions;
particularly with regard to credit terms and specifically interest rates. It
is expected that this will result in increased competition between banks and
more responsibility and accountability for management. Ultimately, this
should lead to better and mcre competitive financial products.
4.02 Interest Rates. Traditionally, Tunisia has had a very detailed
structure of interest rates, closely regulated by the Central Bank. This
structure included the discount rates of the Central Bank for short- and
medium-term paper, which varied with the sector (industry, agriculture,
housing, tourism, etc.) and the purpose (construction, seasonal credit,
medium- and small-size industry, exports, etc.). Interest rates
1/ Most long-term lending is channeled through the development banks.



- 27 -
on commercial bank loans were fixed accordingly, taking into account
rediscountability and maturity. Interest rates on deposits (both sight and
term) and savings accounts were also set by the Central Bank. Under this
system, margins between borrowing and lending rates were set by the Central
Bank for each type of operation.
4.03     In April 1985, the Government started using interest rate policies
more decisively as an instrument of economic policy; general interest rates
were raised by 1-2 points. Since then, rates on special savings accounts have
ranged from 6.52 to 9.752 p.a. and rates on certificates of deposit and
long-term accounts, from 5.51 to 10.5% p.a.. Compared to inflation (which
ranged between 6 and 81), these rates were marginally positive in real terms.
Also, lending rates on long-term loans (available from the development banks
only or nearly so) were deregulated to reflect increasing interest rates
abroad. Since then, these rates have hovered between 12 and 141 per annum.
In the spring of 1986, subsidized low interest rates on special operations in
agriculture, tourism and industry were raised by 3-4 percentage points.
Together with the decline in the inflation rate (from 8.21 to 6.51), itself a
very satisfactory achievement, these increases of the nominal interest rates
raised real rates by 3-5 points. Most rates are now positive in real terms,
in line with the recommendations of the Bank's Financial Sector Report
(No. 5263-TUN of December 16, 1985). With the agreements reached under ITPAL
and the IMF's Stand-by Agreement, Tunisia's interest rate and credit policies
are satisfactory.
4.04     The Government's interest rate policy for SMI is linked with the new
101 "priority activities ratio" (para 2.17 IV). This ratio, in effect since
September 1986, obliges commercial banks to invest at least 101 of their
sight-, time- and savings deposits in "priority activities" (i.e. in export,
agriculture and SMI). With regard to SMI, only medium-term loans (up to seven
years) qualify for admittance under the ratio. If the ratio is not respected,
the commercial banks have to maintain interest free balances, equivalent to
the shortfall, with the Central Bank. If the ratio is surpassed, the
comnercial banks can rediscount the loans (at 6.751) at the Central Bank.
However, because medium-term loans to SMI carry a client rate of 8.01, the
margin allowed on these operations is not very attractive.
4.05     Traditionally, long-term finance (i.e. over seven years) has been
available from the development banks only. However, the developement banks
with the exception of BDET, one of the participating banks in the proposed
project -   have shown limited interest in SMI financing.  The only long-term
finance for SMI available in the commercial banks came from Loans 1504 and
1969-TUN. These funds, however, were only managed -- and not borrowed - by
the commercial banks. As explained in para 3.21, the utilization of Loan
1969-TUN became attractive to the commercial banks only when lack of liquidity
drove short-term lending rates up, which made the rediscounting facility very
profitable.
4.06     Under the proposed project, long-term lending to SMI will be
attractive to the banks and to SMI. The attractiveness of the proposed loan
to the commercial banks stems essentially from two features: first, the
sub-loans financed from Bank funds - because they involve a priority
sector - will be admitted under the new 10l ratio, although they will not be
rediscountable i'. (This will enable banks to use their deposits for other
operations, essentially short-term); second, the
1/ Only loans made from sight, term and savings deposits are rediscountable.



- 28 -
financial margin on the SMI operations financed from the proposed loan will be
satisfactory (nearly 4X).
4.07     The proposed loan has several attractive features for SMI.  First,
long-term finance will be available from the commercial banks; without the
proposed loan, the only source of long-term finance would be BDET, which has
no branches and does not provide commercial banking services. Second,
long-term finance can be combined with lower cost medium-term finance and thus
provide SMI an attractive finance package with respect to maturity and average
cost. Third, low cost medium-term finance -- as provided under the "priority
activities ratio" -- is only available to new SMI with investments (including
working capital) below TDl,000,000 (para 3.33), while the proposed loan would
also be available to existing and larger SMI identified as high priority under
ITPAL (para. 2.17 I (iv)).
4.08   The Development Banks.  Till 1980, there were only two development
banks, Banque de D6veloppement Economique de Tunisie (BDET) and Banque
Nationale de D6veloppement Touristique (BNDT), specialized in medium and
long-term (MLT) financing of industry and tourism, respectively. IFC has
equity holdings in both, and the Bank has had a long financial relation with
BDET, dating from 1957, now totalling ten loans for an aggregate amount of
US$158.0 million (net of cancellations) -' of which US$42.7 million were
still undisbursed as of February 28, 1987. Over the 1981-1983 period, another
six development banks were created. Of these, four were joint ventures
between Tunisia and other Arab countries: the Tuniso-Koweiti Development Bank
(BTKD), the Tuniso-Saudi Investment Development Company (STUSID)2', the
Tunisian and Emirates Investment Bank (BTEI) and the Tuniso-Qatari Investment
Bank (BTQI). The other two were Banque Nationale de Developpement Agricole
(BNDA) which only finances projects in the agricultural sector, and Banque de
Coop6ration du Maghreb Arabe (BCMA) which finances only Tuniso-A'gerian
ventures. A main reason for their creation was to attract capital resources
from oil exporting countries and channel them into productive uses, on the
basis of sound financial, economic and technical criteria. More recently, two
additional development banks were created in association with Italy and Libya,
again with the primary objective of mobilizing foreign funds to finance
development projects in Tunisia.  The Tuniso-Lybian bank is inactive.  Another
development bank, set up with Senegal, has as a primary objective to provide
financial assistance in t1le context of closer economic relations between the
two countries. In comparison with commercial banks, the newly treated
development banks have relatively large share capital (e.g., BT&  and STUSID,
TD 100 million each; BTEI, TD 50 million; BTQI, TD 70 million) subscribed
equally by Tunisia and each of the Arab states involved.
4.09     The creation of this large number of development banks in the 1982-85
period , attracted over US$200 million in foreign capital participation and
enabled a high level of investment in the manufacturing industry, as shown
1/ Not including the amounts committed by BDET under loans 1505-TUN and
1969-TUN (SSI projects).
2/  BTKD and STUSID have been beneficiaries of two loans from the Bank, each
amounting to US$15 million, for Export and EMI projects (Loans 2522-TUN
and 2554-TUN).



- 29 -
in Chapter 2. A substantial part of the resources of the new banks have gone
into large, capital-intensive and often majority Government-owned projects,
many of which have long gestation periods, are highly import dependent and do
not have an export orientation. Since mid-1985, following the decline in oil
and phosphate revenues and the consequent pressures on the trade balance,
imports cf inputs and equipment have become more difficult, and this has
negatively affected the implementation of these large projects. Depending on
the exposure of each bank in these projects, they all face more or less
significant problems. It is likely, however, that most of these portfolio
problems will be temporary and will be resolved gradually as the macroeconomic
and sector-specific measures agreed with the Government become effective.
4.10     In the past, the development banks (with the exception of BDET) have
shown interest primarily in projects with investments over TD 5 million.
Smaller projects were considered too difficult and too expensive because of
the relatively high cost of appraisal and supervision per dollar loaned.
Development banks also have no branches, which makes lending for relatively
small projects outside the Tunis region difficult.
B. Fonds de Promotion et de Dcentralisation Industrieles (FOPRODI)
and Fonds National de Garantie (FNG)
4.11   FOPRODI.  FOPRODI, set up by Law 73-82 of December 31, 1973, is a fund
to provide financial assistance to small and medium-scale enterprises
essentially; in particular, to new entrepreneurs who have limited resources to
start their own enterprises. It also provides financial incentives for
regional development in the form of interest rate, investment and
infrastructure subsidies to which enterprises are entitled under Law 81-56
(amended by Law 83-105) which encourages investments in the country's less
developed areas, irrespective of the size of the enterprise.
4.12     The Fund is financed from budgetary allocations, administered by the
Central Bank, authorized by API and operated through commercial banks that
have signed participation agreements. There is no special staff employed by
the Fund. Its commitments are automatic upon approval of projects by API.
FOPRODI assistance to SMI takes the following forms:
a)   Repayable Advances:
(i)       For projects with investments below TD 500,000, the advance
amounts to 70% of the share capital, with a maximum of
TD 105,000. The promoter has to finance at least 10% of
the project cost out of his own funds.
(ii)      For projects with investments between TD 500,000 and
TD 1,000,000, the advance amounts to 45% of the share
capital, with a maximum of TD 135,000. The promoter has to
provide at least 25% of the project cost.
Advances have to be reimbursed in 12 years, with 5 years grace. The interest
rate charged is 4% p.a.. Advances are not subordinated to other debts.



- 30 -
b)   Credit and Interest Subsidies
(i)       For projects with investments under TD 150,000, FOPRODI
provides loans of ten years (including three years grace)
at 42; and
(ii)      For projects with investments between TD 150,000 and TD
500,000, there is an exemption1' of the first six months
interest charges on medium and long-term advances.
4.13     Since its creation, FOPRODI has provided assistance to SMI for an
aggregate amount of TD 37.4 million (about US$50 million equivalent), of which
TD 21.8 million has been in advances, TD 15.2 million in low interest credits,
and TD 0.4 million in interest subsidies. Another TD 16.9 million has been
provided for non-reimbursable regional subsidies (of which TD 3.7 million to
Agence Fonciere Industrielle; API), which generally were granted irrespective
of the size of the enterprise. About 1,350 enterprises have benefitted from
FOPRODI's assistance; 840 in the form of advances, and 510 in the form of
credits. These enterprises are for 45X located in less developed regions and
are distributed over all sectors, but mainly in agro-industries (27.2X), EMI
(20.07), construction (13.72) and textiles (10.4X).
4.14     The FOPRODI operations are highly subsidized and the interest rate
(4X) is substantially negative in real terms. The supervision of FOPRODI's
operations (advances and credits) is not sufficiently organized and has led to
important arrears on collection. Total collection since beginning operation
(in 1976) has amounted to only TD 2.1 million of principal and TD 2.6 million
of interest, against actual amounts due of TD 3.7 million and TD 4.3 million,
respectively. Thus, 54.32 of interest and principal repayment is in arrears.
Because of budgetary constraints which will curtail future funding, FOPRODI
should improve collections by actively pursuing accounts in arrears and reduce
its subsidy element through higher interest rates.
4.15     During appraisal of the project, the Government agreed that a
committee be appointed to take stock of FOPRODI's ten years of experience, by
analyzing the implementation of the projects financed, the utilization of the
financing made available, and the results achieved (including repayments and
arrears). The committee would also make recommendations on the Fund's future
operations, terms, funding and management, in order to overcome the
deficiencies affecting the present scheme. The members of the committee were
appointed in January 1987, and their report will be sent to the Bank, before
September 30, 1988, for review and comments. The Government has also decided
that, while the study is being carried out, FOPRODI will:
(a)    intervene only in priority projects (as defined by ITPAL);
(b)    make sure that promoters who apply for its assistance are without
sufficient resources of their own to implement their projects; and
1/ FOPRODI pays commercial banks the first interest payment due on their
loans to SMI.



- 31 -
(c)    limit its action to what can be funded from the amounts recovered
from its current beneficiaries; a budgetary provision of TD 500,000
only is foreseen.
4.16   FNG (Fonds National de Garantie).  Established by Law 81-100 of
December 31, 1981, the FNG provides guarantees mainly for small and medium
agricultural, industrial and artisanal production units, and primarily in
connection with credits obtained to finance projects for the creation or
expansion of such units and their export operations. An FNG guarantee covers
between 502 and 751 of outstanding principal. The banks assume the risk in
respect to the balance of the principal and to the total of the interest.
4.17     The FNG's main objective is to encourage banks to extend credit to
agricultural and SMI projects. It essentially provides additional security
for projects considered more risky. The Fund is administered by the Central
Bank, managed by an interministerial commission, and funded by:
(a) a 1/8% one-time levy on the total amount of the guaranteed credit,
which is paid by the beneficiaries of such guarantees;
(b) a 1/82 one-time levy on investment loans not eligible for FNG
guarantee, which is paid by banks (out of their equity resources) for
the benefit of non-agricultural sectors; and
(c) a 5/81 levy on short-term bank overdrafts.
For arrears on principal, the Central Bank provides immediate refinancing for
the total amount of the arrears (excluding interest) at the rate applicable
for the credit concerned, for an undetermined period until payment by the
borrower or final settlement by the FNG. Arrears on loans guaranteed by the
FNG, therefore, do not affect adversely the liquidity position of banks.
C. The Participating Banks
Overview
4.18     Tunisia's commercial banks are essentially deposit-retail banks.
They are small by international standards. As of December 31, 1985, the
assets of all commercial banks combined amounted to TD 3.8 billion (US$4.6
billion). Besides short-term credit, commercial banks can provide medium-term
loans (up to a maximum of seven years) within limits set by the Central Bank.
Long-term credits (over seven years) from regular commercial banks resources
can be extended to public enterprises only, and these credits should not
exceed 31 of the total deposits of the bank concerned. Long-term loans to
private enterprises can be provided by commercial banks only from special
resources (i.e. non-deposits, such as IBRD loans), themselves with a maturity
of more than seven years.



- 32 -
4.19     The commercial banks are subject to the monetary policy and credit
controls of the Central Bank. In the past, these were rather specific and
concerned interest rates (both deposit and lending), utilization of resources
(the 43% "RGFD", see para. 2.17, IV), credit growth and sectoral priorities,
access to rediscounting facilities and money market, as well as foreign
exchange transactions. Despite these many constraints, the commercial banks
can be regarded as true full-service banks. They receive deposits of all
types; they grant a substantial volume of medium and long-term loans (about
272 of their total credit to the economy); they absorb nearly half the total
refinancing facilities of the Central Bank; they effect operations with
special resources supplied by the Government or raised abroad; they are the
almost exclusive intermediaries in foreign exchange operations they hold a
large portfolio of capital participations in enterprises; they control
portfolio management companies, and they are the main intermediaries in stock
exchange operations.
4.20     In recent years, with the creation of new development banks, the
commercial banks' share in financing the Tunisian economy - as measured by
the total amount of their outstanding credit balances to the economy
(including Government and securities portfolios) -- declined from 78.92 at
end-1980, to 75.8% at end-1983 and 72.52 at end-1985. This trend, however, is
unlikely to continue in the next few years as the new development banks will
have used up their initial capital. The table below shows the growth of
credit to the economy in the period 1980-1986:

Credit to the economy has been growing very rapidly during the period, which
has led to overheating of the economy. Following the new monetary policy
guidelines, the overall credit expansion in the future years will be curtailed
subs.tantially and should increase in a manner more consistent with the overall
growth of the economy. In 1986, credit expansion was held at 3-51.
a. The Commercial Banks
4.21    The participating banks have been selected on the basis of objective
criteria such as: the participation in the Bank SSI projects, the number of
branches (particularly, outside Tunis), their capital base and debt: equity
ratio, their medium and long-term portfolio condition, their investments in
the industrial sector etc.. The very small banks (which have few branches and
little institutional capacity to develop term lending), as well as the banks
more oriented to agriculture or commerce, have therefore been excluded. The
following paragraphs describe and analyze the main elements of the financial
situation, management and organization, ownership, policies and procedures,
operations and future prospects of the participating commercial banks.
4.22    The three commercial banks selected to participate in the project
Banque du Sud (BS), Banque de Tunisie (BT) and Soci6te Tunisienne de Banque
(STB) - represent about 461 of the total assets and deposits of all
commercial banks (see Annex 5). With a total assets value of TD 1.7 billion
(US$2.1 billion) as of December 31, 1985 and outstanding loans of over TD 1.4
billion, these banks cover all sectors, regions and sizes of industry (public
and private). Of the loan portfolio, about TD 260 million (US$321 million) is
outstanding in medium and long-term loans to enterprises. Total share capital
participation amounted to TD 23.7 million or about 27% of total equity of the
participating banks; this is a prudent but still significant ratio.
4.23    The financial situation of the participating banks is generally
satisfactory (see Annex 5): (i) Banque du Sud has the lowest liquidity ratio
(4.11 of total assets and 6.2% of demand deposits), while Banque de Tunisie
has the highest (14.2% and 25.61, respectively); (ii) all participating banks
have provisions of about 31 of risk assets except BT which has 71; (iii) all
banks have debt/equity ratios of about 18:1; and (iv) all banks have stayed
very close to the required medium-term portfolio ratio of 18% (BS has the
highest ratio of 19.8%); but as regards the percentage of loan portfolio, BT
and STB have the highest ratio (21.4 and 18.9). Thus relatively unfavorable
ratios in one aspect are generally balanced out by relatively good ratios in
other aspects. Most banks intend to increase their share capital in the near
future to further improve their financial position. It should be mentioned
that the creation of provisions is made difficult for fiscal reasons, as
provisions for unrealized losses are taxed as income; this aspect is under
review by the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance.
4.24    Intermediation margins are traditionally small in Tunisia, compared
with other countries (see Financial Sector Report, para. 3.46). For the three
participating banks, the overall intermediation margin for the year 1985 was
3.61, of which 0.61 i#as for profit margin, 0.6b for provisions and
depreciation and 2.41 for operating costs - including taxes --, of which
1.21 was for personnel (see Annex 5 for detail by bank). The low
intermediation margin on the medium-term portfolio (about 21) is one of the
main causes of the relatively low profitability of the commercial banks.
Return on equity (including reserves and retained earnings) and share capital



- 34 -
for the three participating banks was on average 11.4b and 27.51,
respectively, wh'ch has permitted an average dividend payment of 82 in 1985.
These rates are satisfactory but reflect the low capitalization of most
Tunisian banks. Increases in share capital are likely to reduce these returns
in the future. In comparison with interest rates on term deposits, the return
on equity is not very attractive. An increase in the average margin to about
41 will enable the creation of larger provisions, the extension of better and
more professional services, as well as a marginal improvement in profits.
4.25    It has not been possible to make a case by case assessment of the
portfolio situation of the participating commercial banks. There are four
reasons for this: first, commercial banks have a large portion of their
portfolio in the form of advances in current account ("decouvert") with no
fixed maturity on repayment schedule. Second, non-performing loans to public
enterprises cannot be put in litigation, provided for or written-off (neither
the Central Bank nor the Ministry of Finance permit these actions, because
both take the position that loans to public enterprises are fully secured).
Third, term-loans are administered as a series of notes, each with its own
maturity. Banks have a very good knowledge of the amounts due at any time but
it is difficult to obtain a proper analysis of the age of overdues (company by
company), or of the total outstanding related to overdue notes. Fourth, the
long legal procedures encourage accommodation and rescheduling, rather than
prolonged litigation or liquidation of collateral. Overall, however, banks
are well secured; they also closely check non-performing clients.
4.26    Participating commercial banks are joint stock companies and are
quoted on the Tunis stock exchange. STB and BS are majority government owned
(54% and 562, respectively). STB is 1001 locally owned; it is the principal
bank for industrial finance and is 2.7 times the size (in assets) of the next
largest participating bank. A large proportion of its portfolio is invested
in public enterprises. An Italian Bank (Monte Dei Paschi di Siena) has a 21%
share holding in Banque du Sud. Banque de Tunisie is wholy privately owned,
including share participations of French, Italian, Swiss and German financial
institutions. Details on the ownership and shareholders of the participating
banks are provided in Annex 6.
4.27    Because of the close supervision exercised in the past by the Central
Bank (BCT), management is generally concerned with following the guidelines,
ratios and procedures prescribed by BCT. Internal management is mainly
oriented towards ensuring proper, low-cost administrative procedures for
credit management. BT has put iXlatively more emphasis on information
systems, professional competence and internal communications, while BS and STB
rely more on committee decision making, with limited but clear delegation of
authority and reliance on a stable staff with long experience.
4.28    The banking sector is not very competitive, partly because of the
large role played by the Government and public enterprises until recently, and
partly because of the regulations and controls which used to fix interest
rates on deposits and lending. Competition on the basis of quality of service
was also minimal because margins did not permit it. Within this environment,
STB has maintained its leading position even though its market share as
regards deposits is declining. BT is more conservative in its lending
operations, but is aggressively attracting local deposits. Banque du Sud,
which has traditionally focussed its services on the south, is expanding in
the other regions; it is also strengthening, under new management, its
internal controls and procedures.



- 35 -
4.29    The commercial banks remain essentially providers of self-liquidating
credits. Insofar as they were required to provide L2dium and long-term credit
for industrial development, they did so in sectors promoted by the Government
(initially, textile; later, construction materials and electro-mechanical
products), to public enterprises or to clients with a past credit record.
Banks still do not have elaborate study departments but have a good knowledge
of their clients, of the sectors in which they operate and the effects of
Government policies or of changes in the economic situation abroad. One
weakness, however, is that insufficient objective, technical, financial,
market and economic analysis is used in investment decisions. One of the main
goals of the proposed project is to encourage this type of analysis as a tool
for improving the financing of industrial projects; particular, for SMI.
Improvements in this area are expected to be achieved quickly because most
staff in the commercial banks have a good theoretical knowledge of financial
and economic project appraisal. Management's insistence on the utilization of
these analyses, some additional training and proper staffing of the credit
departments are expected to bring these improvements about (para. 3.27 and
6.03 (g)). Better margins on long-term lending are also expected to induce
these actions.
4.30    Subproject supervision and follow-up is mainly performed to ensure
that the equipment and goods financed by the bank are physically present and
that intended business plans are executed. If problems develop and financial
solutions (including rescheduling occasionally) do not improve the situation,
the banks generally stay at arms-length, and use outside lawyers to secure
recovery of principal.
4.31    Term lending is conducted on a fully secured basis with generally
tight contrQls over receipt of liens and mortgages on financed plant and
equipment. Disbursements are made against presentation of documents of
purchase or title, which includes a verification of reasonable cost and actual
delivery. Existing procurement and disbursement procedures by the banks are
adequate to ensure future compliance with Bank requirements (see para 5.15).
4.32    All banks are audited by qualified auditors, who are members of the
Tunisian association of certified accountants, created in June 1983. Audits
are conducted in conformity with accepted standards, and each bank has
received a positive audit report.
4.33    The banks are important providers of employment; in total, about 39840
people are employed in the participating banks of which 552 are in the head
office and the remainder in the branches. Senior staff accounts for about 52,
middle-level staff for about 16% and clerical and general staff for 79% of
total employment (see Annex 6) The staff structure in the two Government
controlled banks (STB and BS) reflects their very centralized management. In
general, and in all banks, important decisions are made in the head-office,
which is reflected in the very low ratio of staff to clerical personnel in the
branches.



- 36 -
4.34     The branch network (see Annex 6) of the participating banks has grown
more or less in line with the growth of assets (about 20% per annum) over the
period 1984-1986. While STB and BS have on average 11 employees per branch,
Banque de Tunisie (which relies relatively more on centralized electronic data
processing and frequent communications with the head office) has fewer
employees per branch -- some of which are essentially windows. The three
banks have 136 branches outside the Greater Tunis area. In the main economic
centers, all banks have fully staffed branches. The branch network should
ensure satisfactory geographical coverage and quality of service.
4.35     The participating banks are full service banks, operate nationwide,
in all sectors and provide service to all type of clients (public and
private). No bank specializes in SMI financing. About 801 of the commercial
banks loan portfolio is for short-term operations. Within the 20% reserved
for term lending, totalling about TD 260 million as of September 30, 1986, it
is estimated that about 40% is outstanding in SMI projects. With the
exception of STB, which has about 70% of its loan portfolio outstanding in
public enterprises, the participating banks have no particular preference for
specific type of clients, subsectors of industry or size of projects.
4.36     On the basis of the requests for investment license received by API
in the past, about 401 of all investments in manufacturi.ig industries in the
VIth Plan period, equal to about TD 130 million (US$160 million) per year,
concern SMI projects.  Since it is estimated that on average about 50% of
these investments are financed by term loans, a total of about TD 65 million
would have been financed annually. Managers of the commercial banks confirmed
that, on average, they have approved financing for SMI projects in amounts
coherent w4th eh'e above total.
4.37     1       ons of future operations, per bank are difficult to make.
Pipelines oi s.l projects do not exist because small projects disappear from
the pipeline in about three months: either they are approved, or they are
taken off the list within a six months period. Financing requests are
accepted only after the sponsor has provided a minimum technical, financial
and marketing proposal; they are processed within rather short periods.
General economic conditions are the main determinants for the level of
investment requests. The policy package agreed with the Bank (under the ASAL
and ITPAL) and IMF should provide a favorable framework for SMI investment.
4.38     The commercial banks are conservative with regards to future medium
and long-term lending to SMI. The banks agree that annual commitments of TD
5-7 million per bank (US$6.3 - 8.2 million), equal to the past level of
commitments, is a reasonable assumption for future operations. However, with
regards to financial requirements, the participating banks are concerned about
the uncertainties in the economic situation and about paying the commitment
fee. Furthermore, because the growth of deposits (which needs to be utilized
first) is unknown, it is difficult to forecast other resource needs;
particularly, for a sector whose future financial needs are not easy to
predict and for a type of finance which is relatively new. Therefore, on the
basis of total expected commitments of US$14-23 million per bank for the next
30 months period, resource requirements in foreign exchange were estimated at
an average of US$5.5 million per bank for the whole period.
4.39     Based on the overall assessment of the participating banks, they can
be considered financially sound, creditworthy and generally well managed.

b.  Banque de Developpement Economigue de Tunisie (BDET)
Ownership, Staffing and Organization
4.40     BDET1' was created in 1959 and reorganized with the assistance of
the Bank Group in 1966. IFC is a shareholder in BDET with some 15 other
foreign companies which, together, hold about 39% of the outstanding share
capital of TD 30.0 million. Among the local shareholders (Annex 7, Table 1),
the Government and Government-controlled institutions hold about 47.5%, while
six private local banks and private individuals hold the balance of about
13.5% of the outstanding share capital. This wide shareholding has enhanced
BDET's independence in decision making and access to resources.
4.41     BDET has a competent and experienced staff which consists of w3ll-
trained economists, financial analysts and engineers. In the last five years,
however, BDET has lost some of its senior and experienced staff, inter alia to
the newly created development banks, but also to some of the projects it has
promoted. Still, the staff have grown from 204 in 1983 to 231 as of
end-1986. About half of this increase was for support staff (14), while the
main increase in professional staff was for computer-related professionals
(2), project staff (8) and administrative officers (3).
4.42     BDET's organization (Annex 7, Table 2) comprises two operational
departments. The Project Appraisal/Supervision Department, with 19
professional staff, receives on average about 300 financing requests per year,
of which about 100 on average are retained for financing. The department also
reviews annually the progress of about 200 projects, or about one quarter of
all outstanding loans. The Promotion Department, which was created in 1978
and has 12 professional staff (the majority of which are highly qualified
engineers), has evaluated and implemented about 30 projects. Of these
projects, 20 have been promoted with substantiai Government support2- or are
public enterprises, while 10 are private initiatives. BDET also has four
non-operational departments: Administration, Personnel, Commitments, and
Resource Mobilization and Participation. The latter department is responsible
for resource mobilization as well as the supervision and management of the
equity portfolio. All departments are managed by staff that have been with
BDET for over ten years.
Operations
4.43     Before 1981, BDET was the only development bank specializing in long-
term project finance. Except for a few large projects promoted in the early
1970s (textile, automobile assembly), BDET specialized in the financing of
medium- to small-size industrial projects. With the creation in 1978 of the
Promotion Department, BDET started to actively develop on its own account some
larger projects. Initially, these were co-sponsored by private individuals;
1/ A more detailed description of BDET's policies, management and operations
has been made in the Appraisal Report for the Export Industries Project
(dated March 20, 1985; Loan 2522-TUN) and the Second Electro- Mechanical
Industry Project (dated May 1, 1985; Loan 2554-TUN)
2/ In the form of subsidies, fiscal advantages, duty exemptions on imported
equipment and adoption of import restrictions on competing products.



- 38 -
after 1981, however, with the availability of more funds from the new
development banks, larger projects were promoted jointly by BDET and the other
banks, often with the Government's encouragement. These projects generally
introduced new technologies in Tunisia, increased domestic value added by
forward or backward integration and relied -- in their initial phase -- on
considerable protection and a quasi-monopolistic position in the local market.
4.44     Annex 7, Tables 3-5 show BDET's operations for new and expansion
projects by size, sector, region, ownership and maturity. The level of
approvals has been uneven, closely reflecting economic conditions: in 1981 and
1982, approvals were above TD 60 million, while they amounted to TD 32 million
in 1980 and in 1986. In the 1980-1986 period, operations for less than TD
500,000 (about US$600,000), which concerned mostly SMI projects, accounted on
average for 26.5% of the loan amounts approved and involved a total of TD 85.1
million. These op-rations concerned over 550 enterprises and represented over
75% of BDET's operations. In this period, BDET also provided finance to 26
public enterprises for a total of TD 41.4 million, a little less than half the
amount provided to SMI projects. The SMI projects financed by BDET are evenly
distributed among the sectors: 19.2% for textile and leather, 17S for
construction materials and ceramics, 171 for agro-industries and 151 in EMI.
Profitability
4.45     BDET's profitability suffers from three adverse conditions:
(i) foreign exchange losses to be covered by the Government but not yet paid;
(ii) arrears (in principal and interest) on the outstanding portfolio, and
(iii) a low return on the equity portfolio. These problems are discussed in
the paragraphs below.
4.46 (i) Foreign Exchange Losses. Traditionally, all lending in Tunisia by
commercial and development banks is in local currency, irrespective of the
origin of funds. Ia the 1970s, supported by growing oil revenues, the
Tunisian dinar had increased in value and the foreign exchange risk coverage
by the Government resulted in profits. Since 1981, however, the dinar has
decreased in value resulting in considerable foreign exchange losses. BDET's
losses on account of its foreign borrowings has totalled about TD 49 million
(about US$60 million) in interest and principal; detail of the yearly
accumulation of these losses since 1981 is given in Annex 7, Table 6. The
Government is contractually obligated to reimburse BDET for these losses; so
far, however, it has paid TD 20.5 million only, leaving as of April 30, 1987
an unpaid balance of TD 28.6 million. BDET, as a result, has been obliged to
borrow an equal amount on a short-term basis to meet its debt service
obligations. Its financial situation is affected further because the
Government does not pay interest on its arrears. This situation has become
increasingly difficult for BDET and the impact on its liquidity and
profitability has become unacceptable. A solution has been found within the
context of the proposed loan. The Government will pay BDET (i) TD 15 million
(US$18.5 million) before effectiveness of the proposed loan; and (ii) the
remainder of the losses incurred until January 1, 1987, before December 31,
1989.1'. Foreign exchange losses incurred after January 1, 1987 and until
1/ To compensate BDET for the increased borrowing cost, the Government would
also be charged, effective January 1, 1987, an 11.51 interest per annum on the
average outstanding balance of its arrears, equal to the interest rate charged
by the Central Bank to BDET on short-term borrowings.



- 39 -
a satisfactory solution for the foreign exchange risk coverage is agreed under
the study being conducted under ITPAL (para. 2.17 IV) would also be paid to
BDET with a delay not exceeding those experienced in the past (i.e. 2 years)
I,. During negotiations agreement were reached with the Government on the
resolution of BDET's foreign exchange losses as presented above.
4.47 (ii) Arrears on the Portfolio. As shown in the table below, BDET's
arrears situation has worsened in the last two years both in terms of amounts
as well as of the total loan amount outstanding affected by arrears

As of end-1986, the arrears originiated essentially from some 25 large projects
that had come into production recently and suffered from start-up problems as
explained below. These projects have received more than TD 1 million each in
loans, and account for a total of TD 45.9 million in loan amount outstanding
(equal to 62.5% of BDET's total loan amounts outstanding as i,hown in the table
below).

Among these 25 large projects are 8 public enterprises. In total, 14 public
enterprises are responsible for 17.0% of the amount in arrears, while they
account for about 14.52 in the overall portfolio of TD 227.6 million. The
table below shows the distribution of arrears over the two sectors.

The tourism portfolio has particularly been affected by arrears. On December
31, 1986, it had accumulated TD 5.7 million in arrears, equally divided
between interest and principal, which affected a total of TD 17.5 million in
loan amounts, equivalent to about one-quarter of the total amount of the loans
affected by arrears (TD 72.6 million).
4.48     There are several reasons for the deterioration of BDET's loan
portfolio. In the early 1980s, too many investments were made which were
evaluated under over optimistic assumptions. They were often too large in
scope and their competitiveness was not always assured. These investments
were made possible by considerable oil revenues, the inflow of laige amounts
of capital from abroad (particularly from petroleum exporting countries around
the Persian Gulf) and the Government's desire to advance its industrial
development with new large-scale projects in the EMI, fertilizer, construction
materials and tourism sectors. The creation of seven new development banks
provided an environment -where project promoters were offered easy access to
finance and where the banks were competing with each other to finance projects
with marginal economic, financial and technical justification.
4.49     In early 1985, when the petroleum revenues fell and general economic
conditions in Tunisia and abroad deteriorated, many of these projects (i)
found themselves with insufficient working capital, because of generally
underestimated financial requirements; (ii) operated with an unfavorable cost
structure, because of low capacity utilization and high financial and
amortization charges; and (iii) were generally unable to compete with
producers abroad, and thus were unable to earn the foreign exchange required
to pay for raw materials and impotted intermediate products. Although BDET's
financial situation is mostly affected by the arrears of large projects, the
adverse conditions in the last two years have had particularly negative
effects on the smaller projects ihich have found themselves cut off from the
necessary inputs of materials, spare parts and equipment essential for
continuing their production in an efficient manner.
4.50     The most important actions taken so far to rectify the deteriorating
situation concern the policy reforms undertaken by the Government under ITPAL
and ASAL (paras 2.16 and 2.17). Macro-economic reforms will not rehabilitate
ill-conceived investments, but they provide the necessary environment for



- 41 -
restructuring and complementary actions at the firm's level will be needed.
Some of the policy measures, however, have had and will continue to have an
initially negative effect on BDET's portfolio. 2he tightening of monetary
policy (which is necessary to contain aggregate demand and relieve the
pressure on the balance of payments) has created liquidity problems at the
firm's level, and companies have delayed repayment of loans as it had become
too difficult or too expensive to obtain working capital to finance operations.
4.51     BDET itself has initiated a number of actions designed primarily to
provide a good knowledge of the problems affecting its clients and to develop
action plans to solve these problems on a case by case basis. For this
purpose, BDET has increased its supervision activity and the number of staff
assigned to it. It has also designated senior staff to work closely with the
management of some larger companies, and work out restructuring plans; it has
also obligated companies to hire consultants to assess existing problems and
recommend actions to overcome them. Some of the completed restructurings have
involved the sale of part of the assets to bring companies back to a
manageable size; other companies, that had too many products, have been broken
up in several specialized companies; still others had to be restructured
financially by bringing in new shareholders, providing fresh capital or
granting working capital credits, often through the commercial banks. BDET
has also taken legal actions against 117 of its borrowers in arrears to
protect its own interest and to ensure that borrowers make sufficient efforts
to repay. Another action taken by BDET concerns the rescheduling of loans,
which in 1986 concerned 29 companies. This action has been used mainly in the
context of restructuring plans, and primarily for tourism projects that had
suffered considerably from tensions in the Middle East. After the August 1986
devaluation of the dinar, the tourism sector enjoyed an exceptionally good
winter season and prospects continue to be good. Improvements in the tourism
portfolio have continued in 1987. With regards to public sector companies,
BDET is looking to the Government and the Bank to formulate overall solutions
and actions in the context of the public enterprises restructuring loan
(PERL). At the plant level, BDET will assist the promoters in formulating
restructuring plans to enable the companies to improve their operations. The
overall arrears problem of the Government and the public enterprises, however,
is beyond BDET's authority.
4.52     Some specific organizational weaknesses in BDET have been identified
by the Bank with the help of a senior consultant, and actions to overcome them
have been designed and are being implemented. In particular, since the
financing of large public enterprise projects should decrease in the future,
the role of the Promotion Department would change significantly and part of
its staff could be integrated in BDET's Appraisal and Supervision Department.
This should strengthen the latter's engineering capacity. The disappearance
of the Promotion Department does not mean that BDET will abandon its
promotional activities. These activities will now be part of the regular
appraisal and supervision functions and BDET's promotional role will be
oriented toward smaller projects (below TD 15 million total investments), in
close collaboration with private sponsors and directed towards export markets.
4.53     In the past, the quality of appraisal and -- more particularly -
supervision functions had declined, essentially because BDET did rot allocate
sufficient staff resources to these functions. The transfer of qualified
engineers from the Promotion Department will strengthen the supervision



- 42 -
and restructuring of projects. Also, this function has now been reorganized
so that staff have a more continuous relation with clients. Better client
relations are needed not only for responding to client problems but also as a
means to develop future business. BDET's supervision staff are now encouraged
to develop new projects with the clients, besides carrying out essential
control functions.
4.54     In the light of the serious deterioration of its portfolio, BDET has
increased and is prepared to increase further its supervision functions. In
order to avoid administrative cost increases and to assure an arms-length
approach to solving its clients' problems, BDET has decided to make an
increased use of consultants. The hiring of consultants, the strengthening of
its staff, the incorporation of the Promotion Department in the regular
Appraisal/Supervision Department and the changes in procedures for supervision
was reviewed during negotiations and an agreement was reached on a plan of
action for each sector with significant arrears (public sector, tourism, large
projects, etc.); this may eventually evolve into an arrears reduction
program. The agreement reached is reflected in a letter addressed to the Bank
by BDET's management, which summarizes BDET's intentions for 1988-89 in terms
of supervision policy and work program, use of consultants, and staffing for
supervision.
4.55     The actions agreed under ITPAL to strengthen the economic
environment, along with the other actions to be taken for strengthening the
management and operations in SMI (through API and UTICA, paras 3.15 to 3.30)
should gradually contribute to significant improvements in operations as well
as in the investment climate in which BDET's clients operate.  Overall,
however, and as reflected in the projection in Annex 7 Tables 10-13, the
improvement of BDET's portfolio will require several years of sustained
efforts.  Regular supervision by the Bank should continue for monitoring
closely the solution of BDET's portfolio-related problems and assisting BDET
as necessary.
4.56     The Low Returns on Equity Investments.  In the last three years,
income from equity investments has decreased from TD 560,000 in 1984, to TD
500,000 in 1985 and TD 410,000 in 1986, equivalent to average returns on
average investment of 2.3%, 1.82 and 1.42, respectively. Because equity
investments are an important part of BDET's total assets (10%) and own equity
(85%), the low return on its equity portfolio has a significantly negative
effect on its profitability. Combined with the TD 22.8 million of its foreign
exchange losses outstanding and the TD 24 million of arrears on its loan
portfolio, BDET's total non- or low-performing assets are over 272 of total
assets.
4.57     The low return on BDET's equity portfolio is a sign of the generally
low attractiveness of share capital and the underdeveloped state of the
capital market in Tunisia. The main causes for this situation, as identified
in the Financial Sector Report (Chapter X), are of a fiscal, organizational,
institutional and financial nature. Some of the policy measures agreed under
ITPAL, which should improve the overall profitability of industry, should
indirectly help the equity market. Other measures should also be envisaged
under the planned Public Enterprises Restructuring Loan (PERL), particularly
in the context of the sale of minority Government interests and the eventual
privatization of public enterprises. Improvements in the fiscal environment,
that would make investment in shares more attractive, are also being sought
under the upcoming SAL operation.

Financial Situation
4.58     An analysis of BDET's income statements (attached in Annex 7,
Table 8) shows that continuing problems exist in BDET's interest spread. The
table below shows how interest margins have evolved in the last five years.
Table 4.5: INTEREST MARGIN ON LENDING
(1982-1986)

I/ Interest income: average outstanding loan portfolio.
2/ Interest paid: average outstanding borrowings.
It shows that in the 1982-1986 period, BDET's margin has been very sensitive
to the cost of borrowing, and that the latter was not compensated by a
commensurate increase in lending rates; this was particularly striking in
1984.  Since 1984, the margin has improved but it is still below the minimum
satisfactory level, estimated at about 21.
4.59     While interest rate margins improved, overall profitability remained
low, amounting to TD 2.5 million in 1984, TD 2.7 million in 1985 and TD 2.7
million in 1986, equivalent to returns on equity of 9S, 8.6S and 7.5 S,
respectively. The reason for this decrease is the increasing share of non-
performing assets (para. 4.56) and the insufficient Government payments to
cover BDET's losses on foreign borrowings. The table below which presents
revenues and costs as percentages of average assets, clearly shows the
stagnating, low loan income.

- 44 -
This stagnation in income, in a period when financial costs increased, has
kept BDET's overall profitability low. In the future, the main emphasis
should be placed, therefore, on increasing income, because administrative
costs have been reasonably stable and can be considered satisfactory when
compared with other development banks. The repayment over time by the
Government of the foreign exchange losses, which will decrease borrowing cost
(para. 4.46), along with the action program to improve the portfolio (para.
4.55), should lead to considerable improvements in profitability in the next
years as will be shown in the projections below.
4.60     BDET's financial structure as reflected in the balance sheets of the
last three yeazs (Annex 7, Table 9) shows a satisfactory debt:equity ratio of
about 5:1, which is well below the maximum of 8:1 permitted under existing
Loan Agreements. The current ratio as of December 31, 1986, while negatively
affected by short-term borrowings to finance the arrears of the Government,
stood at an acceptable 1.0. The debt service ratio has remained at 1.0
despite the Government's failure to pay interest on its arrears. Overall,
these ratios are satisfactory; particulary, when considering that a large part
of BDET's debts are related to the Government.
Operational and Financial Projections
4.61     BDET expects its lending operations (Annex 7, Table 10) to increase
slowly from about TD 32 million in 1986 to TD 37.5 million in 1990; its equity
investments approvals are projected to amount to TD 2 million per year.
Outstanding equity investments are projected to increase by about 1 million
per year, taking into account the sales of shares and the time lag between
approval and disbursement of equity participations. SMI loans are expected to
continue to amount to about TD 8 to 10 million per year on average, equivalent
to 252-30 of total lending operations. In mid-1987, BDET had seven requests
for financing SMI projects amounting to TD 1.5 million. (SMI projects are
proressed relatively quickly once they have been accepted by BDET for study).
In the 4th quarter of 1986, BDET approved 17 SMI projects for a total of TD
2.6 million (in a total of 39 projects and TD 7.3 million for the year as a
whole). The proposed loan of US$6.5 million for BDET takes into account that
SMI projects in the export and EMI sectors will be financed under loans
2522-TIN and 2554-TUN, respectively; thus, most SMI projects to be financed
by BDET from the proposed loan will essentially cater to the local market.
4.62     Financial projections are attached in Annex 7, table  I  o 13.  In
the cash-flow, a provision has been made for the reimbursement by the
Government of TD 15 million in 1988 and TD 13.6 million in 1989 for foreign
exchange losses. The income statement also takes into account receipt of
interest on the unpaid balance due by the Government, which amounts to TD 3.45
million in 1987, TD 2.43 million in 1988 and TD 780,000 in 1989. The
cash-flow also makes provisions for rescheduling of outstanding loans in
arrears; these are estimated at TD 11.5 million in 1987 and 1988, and TD 10.0
million thereafter. Because of these expected reschedulings, the portfolio in
arrears is conservatively projected not to improve till 1990, stabilizing at
about TD 40 million, but decreasing as a percentage of total outstanding
portfolio. It is also projected that TD 37.3 million in short-term debt will
be retired as and when the Government repays its arrears. This will improve
the current situation of BDET. The profitability of BDET is projected to



- 45 -
improve as a result of the above actions and of a gradual improvement in
lending and borrowing rates which will bring the financial margin to 22. This
increase in profitability permits a slight increase in personnel and
administrative costs as well as the cost of the consultants referred to in
para. 4.54.
4.63     On the basis of the projected level of operations, total borrowing
will increase by about TD 35 million, to almost TD 280 million by December 31,
1990. This amount includes the replacement of the US$60 million floating rate
notes (FRW, which matures in 1990), by an equivalent amount to be raised in
the international market. Durir.g the projected period, the total outstanding
debt will remain well below the maximum level of eight times the equity. The
projected return on equity, 10% over the five year period, will permit BDET to
continue to pay dividends of about 81 per year. If BDET develops according to
the assumptions used by the projections, its financial condition and
profitability will be satisfactory.
c. Banque de Tunisie et de Emirats d'Investissement (BTEI)
Ownership and policy statement
4.64     BTEI is a development bank created in 1983, with a share capital of
TD 50 million held equally by the Government of Tunisia (32.51 by the Ministry
of Finance and 17.5% by the Central Bank) and the Abu Dhabi Fund, to develop
the financial cooperation and economic complementarity between Tunisia and the
Emirates. For this purpose, BTEI finances as well as promotes creation and
extension projects, in the industry, services and agriculture sectors. BTEI
extends lo-ns and takes equity participations. For projects identified and
promoted by BTEI itself, BTEI never contributes more than 601 of the total
project cost and systematically seeks reliable, active partners, technical as
well financial. For other projects, BTEI does not take participations larger
than that of the promoter (who is expected to contribute at least 301 of the
total project cost), nor larger than 152 of the enterprise equity. The ratio
between its participation in and the loan extended to any enterprise has to
remain below 1/2 and, preferably, in the vicinity of 1/3. BTEI participation
in, and loan to any enterprise cannot represent more than 10% of BTEI's
capital plus reserves.
4.65     BTEI loans have maturities between 2 and 15 years with grace periods
equal to the period of construction plus 6 months. Interest rates charged by
BTEI reflect the cost of its resources as well as market rates. BTEI charges
its clients (i) a fee of 11 of the loan amount to cover the cost of processing
the dossier, and (ii) a commitment fee of 1% on the undisbursed loan balance.
BTEI loans can be disbursed only after the promoter's contribution has been
fully mobilized. BTEI's collateral requirements bear on the project land,
construction and equipement, as well as on other properties of the promoter.
Staffing and organization
4.66     BTEI has a total staff of 78, of which 11 unit managers, 24
professionals and 43 administrative and support staff. BTEI has two
Directorates: Technical and Operations, each headed by a Director. Each
Directorate has four Departments as follows: the Technical Directorate
comprises the Development, Restructuring and Supervision, Studies (market and



- 46 -
sector) and Documentation, and Appraisal Departments. The Operations
Directorate comprises the Commitment and Treasury, Accounting and Audit,
Computing Services and Administration Departments. BTEI management is
concerned with building up and keeping quality staff, firming up operational
techniques and procedures, and maintaining an effective team spirit; for this
purpose, BTEI management has been expanding its staff at a slow and carefull
pace, consistent with the growth of activities.
Operations
4.67     Annexe 8, tables 1-3 provides details about BTEI's operations since
its creation. The amount of BTEI's approval peaked in 1985, reaching TD 25.7
million, and decreased to TD 18.7 in 1986; this was the result of the
country's general economic slump. (The decline of commitments started in 1985,
when a number of approvals were not promptly followed by the promoter's formal
engagement). The larger share of BTEI's total approvals since its creation,
is in industry (about 77%); next come services (about 101), then tourism
(MC"). Agriculture is the sector where BTEI is the least active; it accounts
for only 3% of total approvals. The largest loans extended by BTEI for
industry have been to public projects. More than two-thirds of BTEI loans to
private industrialists have been of a medium (to small) magnitude, ranging
from below TD 0.9 million to TD 2.2 million. Since 1985, BTEI has been
putting an increasing emphasis on SMI projects. Consistent with this
orientation, BTEI has gradually developed its staff capability to process such
projects and has evolved a specific approach where foreign parternership is
systematically sought with a planned buy-back of foreign participations by
local shareholders.
Financial situation and profitability
4.68     Income statements for the last three years are presented in Annexe 8,
Table 4. Since it used up its capital in mid-1987 and will resort to
borrowing in 1988 only, BTEI has no problem arising from its interest spread
or foreign exchange losses. Because BTEI has been in operation for a few
years only, indicators pertaining to its operations and profitability are
still evolving considerably. Its equity portfolio represented 4.31, 6.1% and
10.8% of its total assets in 1984, 1985 and 1986, respectively (and 9.8%, 9.9%
and 15.61 of its own equity in the same years). The return on this portfolio
was 2.0% and 1.4% in 1985 and 1986. BTEI's returns on equity investments are,
therefore, very similar to BDET's (para 4.56) and the reason for such low
returns are the same as for BDET (para 4.57). BTEI's performance in this
respect, however, should improve significantly in the future as poorly
profitable participations in public projects are expected to represent a
rapidly decreasing fraction of BTEI's total equity portfolio.
Financial situation
4.69     BTEI's financial structure reflects its early stage of development;
its has just mobilized its capital and has barely started borrowing. While
its equity went from TD39.1 million in 1985 to TD 53.3 million in 1986, its
debt went from TD 3.0 million to TD 3.4 million in the same period (with,
correspondingly, a very low debt service), resulting in debt: equity ratios of
about 0.1:1 only. Overall, BTEI's ratios are still very satisfactory.



- 47 -
Operations and Financial Proiections
4.70     BTEI expects its lending operations as well as equity investments to
increase significantly in 1988, and thereafter, at a more steady pace (Annex
8, Table 7); this pace is rather ambitious, as it would imply approvals in
1990 of TD 42.5 million of lending and TD 7.5 million of equity
participations. BTEI management is aware of this, but argtals that, after
their first few years, they should be able to expand their operations
significantly and that the increase in the number of requests that they have
received in late 1986 and early 1987 would imply -- if sustained in the future
- an important growth of BTEI's operations. Taking into account the Bank's
reservations, however, BTEI has applied for a relatively modest fraction of
the proposed line of credit: US$ 4 million, the smallest allocation among the
participating banks.
4.71     Financial projections appear in Annex 8, Tables 8-10.  BTEI expects
the return on its equity portfolio to improve soon and stay in the vicinity of
2.42 (with a peak of 3.12 in 1989), which might be somewhat optimistic.
Administrative expenses would increase but at a pace lower than that of the
income from participations. !Ii- significant changes are expected either as
regards arrears or foreign exchange losses. Provisions would increase in a
manner consistent with the loan portfolio; also, financial charges would start
being significant, but would remain much lower than interest income. Thus,
BTEI's situation would evolve toward that of a mature institution, and BTEI
should be able to maintain its profitability in a satisfactory manner.
4.72     BTEI's projected level of operations (para 4.70) would imply total
borrowings of about TD 50 million by 1990, which remains most reasonable
vis-a-vis BTEI's equity. The return on equity tiould be satisfactory which
would permit BTEI to pay dividends of the magnitude (4) expected by the
shareholders. If BTEI develops according to its assumptions (or even below
these, as would appear more realistic), its financial and profitability would
remain satisfactory.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives and Components
5.01     The proposed project builds on the successful completion of the two
earlier projects in the sector. By furthering the development of SMI in
Tunisia, the project will continue to pursue the objectives set in the SSI
project as well as new objectives which have been ident.ified during
supervision and project preparation.  These objectives are :
(i)    to increase the financial resources available to the commercial
banks, to make the financing of SMI operations more attractive to
them, and to strengthen term lending departments in commercial
banks so that they can develop and improve medium- and long-term
instruments for SMI financing;
(ii)   to finance through commercial banks, BDET and BTEI economically
justifiable, financially sound and technically .iable projects in
the sector;



- 48 -
(iii)  to foster the development of a new class of industrial
entrepreneurs in Tunisia, as SMI are the training ground for
industrial managers and technicians; and
(iv)   to create employment at an invebtment cost per job lower than the
national average in the industrial sector.
5.02     To achieve these objectives, the proposed project includes
improvements in the delivery mechanism for industrial finance as well as
important deaign changes in the financial products available to SMI. To
support these actions, further institutional improvements are proposed in the
support structures (API and UTICA) for SMI, essentially in the areas of project
promotion and design, and management and operation of small industrial units.
For each of these areas, specific technical assistance and action programs are
included in the proposed project. Besides the specific financial and
institutional support provided under the project, the improvements in the
overall macro-economic and sector specific framework (as agreed under ITPAL)
should also be mentioned as important factors to impact favorably on the
development of SMI. The project would also bring about changes in the FOPRODI
and the financial incentive system for SMI (paras 4.11 -4.15), which would
decrease government budg,nt subsidies and improve the allocation of resources to
the economy, including to SMI.
5.03     The proposed loan would consist of two components: (i) a credit line
of US$27.5 million to three commercial banks, BDET and BTEI for financing
eligible SMI projects; and (ii) US$0.5 million for technical assistance. The
Bank loan would be made to the Government on the usual terms and conditions
applicable to Tunisia (standard variable interest rate and repayment over 17
years including a four-year grace period). The Government would onlend the
proceeds to the participating banks, in local currency, through subsidiary
loan agreements.
a. Credit Line
5.04     Participating Banks.  Credit would be channelled through BDET, BTEI
and three commercial banks: BS, BT and STB. The participation of BDET is
justified by its experience in financing small and medium size industrial
projects. BTEI plans to expand significantly its operations with SMIs; it has
also developed a promising approach for such operations (seeking
systematically foreign, technical and financial partners) and is developing
its staff accordingly. The three commercial banks' involvement is justified
by their active participation in the SSI project, their sound financial
situation and structure, their extensive branch networks and business
contacts, and their interest in developing their medium-term SMI operations in
the industrial sector. The onlending arrangement reflects the Government's
desire to give greater responsibility and independence to the commercial banks.
5.05     The credit line would be allocated as follows: BDET, US $6.5 million;
STB and BS, US $6 million each; BT, US $5 million; and BTEI, US $4 million.
This allocation is based on each of the participating banks project pipeline,
past volume of activity, and a reasonable estimate of future growth as
described in paras. 4.36 to 4.38. The use made of the allocated funds will be
reviewed 18 months after the loan comes into effect, but no later than
December 31, 1989. In case a bank has not utilized at that time at least
$2,000,000 of its allocation, the unutilized balance could be reallocated to
the other participating banks who have utilized at least this amount.
Subsequent revisions would take place on the basis of yearly reviews, or more
frequently if needed.



- 49 -
5.06     Specific actions to make term-lending to SMI more attractive to
commercial banks and to equip and organize them in order to improve the
quality of service and assistance to SMI have been described in paras.
3.21-3.27. They include: (i) better financial margins on term-lending, i.e.
nearly 41; (ii) inclusion of the subloans financed from Bank funds in the
"priority activities ratio"; (iii) more independence in decision making (i.e.
no prior API or Central Bank approval); (iv) better staffing of credit
departments; and (v) fiscal incentives to provide funds for training, studies
and promotion. During negotiations, confirmations of these actions were
obtained (see para. 6.03).
5.07     The Onlending Terms.  The Government will onlend loan proceeds to
participating banks at the Bank lending rate in force at the time of signing
of the Loan Agreement. The onlending rate to the participating banks may be
adjusted by mutual agreement between the Government, the participating banks
and the Bank, in the light of changes in the latter's own lending rate, the
overall level and structure of interest rates prevailing in Tunisia, the
competitiveness of the local interest rate on long-term funds, the demand for
medium and long-term credit, and the utilization of loan proceeds. However,
at no time will the onlending rate between the Government and the banks be
less than the Bank's rate. The parties will consult together at least once a
year on the subject of the onlending rate and its possible adjustment. Any
adjustment will only affect the uncommitted part of the loan.
5.08     Loan proceeds will be onlent to participating banks in Dinars.  To
cover -- or at least contribute to the coverage of (para. 5.09) -- the foreign
exchange risk, the Government will charge a 12 flat fee which the
participating banks will pass on to the subborrowers. Participating banks
will reimburse the Government for the amounts onlent to them according to the
consolidated schedule of the individual subloan repayment schedules agreed
with their SMI clients and recorded in the subloan agreements. The banks will
also undertake to pay the standard commitment fee (0.75% per annum) on amounts
committed but not yet disbursed. The participating banks will be allowed a
sufficient margin, but not exceeding four percentage points, which should
permit them to (a) cover their operating costs (estimated at about 2.12); (b)
fund reserves for bad debts (about 1.12); and (c) make a reasonable profit
(about 0.8%). At today's Bank lending rate (about 82), the onlending rate to
final beneficiaries would be about 12%; additionally, beneficiaries would pay
a 12 flat fee for the foreign exchange risk. The onlending rate to
subborrowers will be reconsidered, if need be, at the time of the review
mentioned in para. 5.07. The banks may also recover the commitment fee from
their clients. The maximum period for repayment of subloan principal will be
eleven years including a maximum grace period of three years. Up to
US$600,000 of the amounts allocated to each participating bank would be
available for equity investments in eligible SMI projects; proceeds of the
proposed loan used for such investments will be reimbursed to the Government
in eleven years including three years grace. The onlending arrangements were
confirmed during negotiations and reflected in the Loan Agreement and will be
recorded in the Subsidiary Loan Agreements to be concluded between the
Government and the participating banks.

5.09       It is in the context of the exchange rate and interest rate
policies (reviewed by the IMF and the Bank) that solutions for dealing with
the foreign exchange problem are being sought. During negotiations of ITPAL,
the Government and the Bank have agreed on terms of reference for two
studies. First, a study of ways to improve the system of prntection against
exchange risk on foreign borrowings, abiding inter alia by the following
three principles: (i) the end-user of the loan will himself bear the exchange
risk when his operation is of a sufficient scale to enable him to do so; (ii)
specific criteria will govern access to exchange risk guarantees, these being
reserved solely to qualified smaller enterprises; and (iii) irrespective of
the type of system eventually adopted, it should be viable without government
subsidies. Second, a study to be conducted by the Central Bank to identify
ways for improving the system of forward coverage of exchange risk in the
context of the country's foreign borrowing policy so as to minimize its impact
on the balance of payments. For the proposed project, which deals with
entrepreneurs that are the least capable of insuring or covering the risk,
participating banks will collect a flat 12 fee - in addition to the interest
rate on medium and long-term loans -- to be paid into the existing Exchange
Risk Equalization Fund. As and when a new foreign exchange risk coverage
scheme becomes operative (which is a condition for second tranche release of
ITPAL), subborrowers financed from the uncommitted balance of the loan will
become subject to the new scheme. This was confirmed at negotiations.
5.10     Subproiect Eligibility Criteria.  Proceeds of the line of credit
would finance: (a) new enterprises with total investments not exceeding TD 1.5
millior. in December 1987 value, including working capital funds; and (b)
existing enterprises with total investments for expansion, modernization,
diversification/integration or rehabilitation/restructuring not exceeding TD
2.5 million in December 1987 value, including working capital and existing net
investments. The maximum amount of the proceeds from the Bank loan to be
utilized in the form of subloans and investments for financing a single
subproject would be US$800,000. Eligible projects should meet the following
requirements which were agreed during negotiations with the participating
banks and reflected in the Project Agreement concluded between the Bank and
the participating banks (para 6.03):
(a)    to be financially sound and profitable, and be able to repay
the proposed subloan (see para. 5.11);
(b)    to be considered economically viable, and have an economic
rate of return of at least 102 per annum; and
(c)    to have a cost per job normally not exceeding TD 30,000 (at
constant December 1987 value). Projects which show a cost per
job higher than TD 30,000 will have to satisfy one of the
following conditions:
(i)      export at least 252 of their output after completion of the
investment;



- 51 -
(ii)     be expansion, modernization or integration projects in which
investment per job (existing and new) is less than TD 30,000 -- in December
1987 terms -- when net existing investment is taken into account; and
(iii)    satisfy the Government's priority objectives formulated in the new
investment law (of August 1987), i.e. the developement of disadvantaged areas,
the transfer of new technology, and industrial integration.
5.11     Appraisal Standards and Format.  Each application for financing will
be the subject of a detailed appraisal, prepared by the participating bank,
consisting of a financial, an economic, a technical and a market analysis.
These reports would cover inter alia:
(i)    the production process, the equipment and technology selected, the
production capacity and expected output, and the description of the
goods to be produced;
(ii)   the ownership structure of the firm, and -  when applicable -- a
commentary on why the bank has decided to take an equity
participation;
(iii)  the investments costs (total and foreign exchange) by component,
details on working capital needs, and project's financing plan;
(iv)   a detailed market analysis (local demand, domestic production and
imports, export potential), and marketing arrangements;
(v)    a description of the protection on the goods to be manufactured (in
terms of duties and taxes) as well as quantitative restrictions and
import licensing, when applicable;
(vi)   an estimate of the number of jobs created, their estimated average
cost, and a special review of the merits of the project when this
average cost is larger than TD 30,000 (para. 5.10 (c));
(vii)  an analysis of the future financial position, profitability and
cash generation for debt service, as well as a demonstration of the
financial and economic viability of the project, including the
computation of the ERRI'; and
(viii) An analysis of the quality of the firm's management, administration
and partners.
API will be available to assist the participating banks in making a
satisfactory economic analysis. The content of appraisal reports were
discussed and agreed during negotiations and reflected in the Project
1/ For the latter, all outputs and tradeable inputs (including capital
equipment) will be valued at border prices, whereas appropriate conversion
factors will be applied to non-tradeable imports (e.g., land, building and
labor). Justification will be provided for both border prices and
conversion factors.



- 52 -
Agreement (para 6.03). When a subproject pertains to the restructuring of an
enterprise, the report will address specifically questions related inter alia
to re-capitalization, enterprise management, technology selected, technical
assistance, marketing arrangement, debt rescheduling/consolidation, etc..
5.12       Subloan Approval.  For subloans under US$400,000 in December 1987
value, the participating bank will request authorization from the Bank in a
simplified form showing that the project satisfies the eligibility criteria.
For subloans of a larger amount, the participating institution will forward to
the Bank, for its review and approval, the appraisal report together with an
amortization schedule of the subloan and a list of the goods to be financed
from the loan. However, for the first US$1,000,000 to be utilized by each
bank, all subloans -- irrespective of size -- will require Bank approval on
the basis of satisfactory appraisal reports. After utilization of US$1.0
million, appraisal reports, amortization schedules and lists of goods for
suibprojects requiring less than US$400,000 in December 1987 value will be send
to the Bank for information only.
5.13       Role of the Central Bank in the Project.  Under the project, the
Central Bank will have three functions: first, it would maintain the "Special
Account" from which disbursements will be made for subprojects financed by the
participating banks; agreement to this effect were reached during negotiations
(para. 6.03). Second, it would administer, bank by bank, the overall
utilization of the loan account. Third, it would assure that subprojects
below the free limit of US$400,000 satisfy the eligibility criteria.
5.14       The Central Bank is reviewing its reporting requirements and
procedures with the commeicial banks, and improvements in monitoring systems
are being studied. To fa'.ilitate the supervision of the project execution and
to streamline reporting requirements with the participating banks, the Central
Bank will consult with Bank missions on these requirements and related
procedures. Annual reporting of the financial position, profitability,
operations and other performance indicators of the participating banks will be
established in close coordination with the Central Bank.
5.15       Procurement and Disbursement.  The participating banks will ensure
that the goods and services procured under the project are suitable to the
investment project considered and are reasonably priced. For this purpose,
the banks will require borrowers to submit documentation showing that
comparative shopping has taken place. The participating bank's appraisal
reports will review the justification for the equipment to be purchased and
provide details on its technical characteristics and the prices quoted.
Procurement for equipment under the API project component (para 3.31 and Annex
3) will follow established Government local shopping procedures which are
satisfactory for the goods and services included in the TA component of the
proposed loan and conform to IBRD procurement procedures. Consultants will be
hired according to Bank guidelines (para. 3.31).
5.16       Disbursements under the credit line for projects receiving Bank
funds through subloans, would be made against 60% of civil works, 70% of goods
and services procured locally, and 100% of the CIF cost of imported goods and



- 53 -
services."' Disbursements for technical assistance to API would be made
against 100% of foreign expenditures and 752 of local expenditures. In order
to expedite project execution and the disbursement for subloans, the
arrangements under the line of credit for SSIs (Loan 1969-TUN) , which called
for a "Special Account" to be opened and maintained with the Central Bank
(that allowed disbursement to participating banks on their presenting
pro-forma documentation), will be used again. The Special Account which will
have an authorized allocation of US$2.5 million (subdivided in
five special sub-accounts proportionately to each participating bank's loan
allocation 2/), would be replenished whenever about one-half to one-third of
the sub-special account provision has been utilized. Replenishment would be
on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOEs). The participating banks
could also submit to the Bank direct payment or special commitment requests
for amounts of no less than US$150,000. These arrangements are very similar
to those used under the SSI project. The estimated disbursement schedule of
the loan, based on standard disbursement profiles for the EMENA/DFC sector, is
given in Annex 9. The final date for submission of subprojects to the Bank
would be December 1, 1991 and the Closing Date would be June 30, 1995.
5.17       Reporting, Accounts and Auditing.  At least once a year,
participating banks would prepare progress reports on the subprojects being
implemented and the projects in their first three years of operation. These
reports would be made available for review by the Bank's supervision missions.
Annual reports on the financial position, profitability, operation and
portfolio, in a form that was agreed upon during negotiations, will be sent to
the Bank through the Central Bank. The participating banks would maintain
separate accounts for subloans extended by them under the project. Separate
project files would be maintained for each subproject, which would give
information on the amount of individual subloans, amount of payments, purpose
of loans, name and address of mnachinery suppliers and the country and origin
of machinery. The banks' financial accounts will be audited by independent
external auditors acceptable to the Bank and furnished to the Bank within six
months of the end of each fiscal year. Similar to the existing agreement for
the SSI project, auditors acceptable to the Bank would prepare the audit
report of the Statement of Expenditures (SOE) and thle Special Account in the
Central Bank, and make it available to the Bank within nine months after the
end of each fiscal year. These auditing arrangements were confirmed during
negotiations. At least once a year, API will submit reports on the progress
in the implementation of the various components of its TA program.
1/ As under Loans 2522-TUN and 2554-TUN.
2 BDET, US $0.59 million; STB and BS, US $0.55 million each; BT, US$0.45
million; and BTEI, US $0.36 million.

b. Technical Assistance
5.18     Under the project, technical assistance will be provided to:
- API, for strengthening its promotional activities and its
capability to help new entrepreneurs in the formulation of their
project (paras 3.28 - 3.31);
- UTICA, for strengthening its SMI Assistance Center and its ability
to help existing entrepreneurs in their management production and
financial planning (paras 3.15 - 3.20); and
- the commercial banks, for strengthening their institutional
capacities; particularly, in the area of term-lending and project
appraisal techniques (paras 3.21 - 3.27).
5.19     The API component, financed from US$500,000 of the loan amount, would
be for expert services ($220,000), training ($30,000), equipment ($150,000)
and studies ($65,000); a $35,000 price and quantity contingency is also
provided for, (Annex 3). Procurement and disbursement would follow the
procedures described in paras 5.15 - 5.16. API will prepare annual reports
detailing the activities, expenditures and results as they relate to the
annual targets under the program. API will maintain separate accounts for
expenditures under the technical assistance component. API will assist Bank
supervision missions assess the extent to which extension services have been
provided properly. During negotiations, agreements were reached on the T.A.
program described in para 3.31 and Annex 3, and the terms of reference of the
expert. Signature of the API grant agreement between the Government and API
related to the TA program is a condition for effectiveness.
5.20     With regards to the financing of the technical assistance component
to UTICA, Belgian authorities have agreed to provide US $730,000 while
US$530,000 (equivalent to TD 450,000) would be covered by the UNDP. UTICA
would provide the necessary resources to cover local costs. The recruitment
would be done according to terms of reference acceptable to the Bank -, and
the monitoring andievaluation of the program components according to UNDP and
ILO procedures. ILO would be the executive agency for the UNDP. The funding
of the program as well as the assurance that the program will conform with the
description provided in paras 3.16 to 3.20, were confirmed during negotiations
and reflected in the Loan Agreement. Signature of the UTICA grant agreement
between the Government and UTICA related to the TA program is a condition for
effectiveness.
1/ These were drafted during appraisal, in collaboration with UTICA.



- 55 -
5.21     Although the Bank would not directly finance the technical assistance
to UTICA, its provisions (i.e. amounts, main components, objectives, duration,
etc. as specified in paras 3.15 - 3.20) will be an integral part of the Loan
Agreement. During negotiations, the Government confirmed to the Bank
bilateral donors' commitments to finance the technical assistance.
5.22     Technical assistance to the commercial banks will be financed from
their own resources (see paras 3.21 - 3.27). Each bank has developed an
action program for strengthening their term-lending organization and for
training their staff. Progress in executing the action program will be
monitored during supervision.
5.23     The proposed technical assistance programs to API, UTICA and the
participating banks should ensure the efficient and effective utilization of
the Bank loan for financing viable SMI projects. The respective roles of each
institution are complementary, and together should help new and existing SMI
in the proper formulation and execution of their projects.
B. Project Benefits and Risks
5.24     The project will provide financial support and technical assistance,
at a critical time of adjustment, to a segment of the manufacturing sector
which makes a major contribution to industrial growth, employment, exports and
industrial diversification. The project is expected to create about 4,000
direct jobs, which represent about 5% of total projected employment creation
in the manufacturing sectori'. The project would also help the commercial
banks develop the capabilities and expertise required to improve their
services to SMI. Technical assistance to API would strengthen its promotional
role and institutional capacity for providing extension services to SMI. The
technical assistance to UTICA would foster the creation of an organization to
provide direct advice and assistance to SMI entrepreneurs; this would result
in improved productivity and efficiency of SMI. Upon the completion of the TA
program, UTICA would employ 20 Tunisian nationals as full-time advisers, and
be able to provide assistance and guidance to about 300 enterprises. The
project would also help BDET strengthen its financial situation as a result
of: (i) the scheduled repayment by the Government of its debt to cover BDET's
foreign exchange losses, and (ii) actions aimed at improving BDET's portfolio
management, through the strengthening of BDET's supervision activities.
1/ The Ministry of Planning and Finance, in its preparation for the Seventh
Plan, expects the creation of new 85,000 jobs in manufacturing industries.



- 56 -
5.25     The project risks relate mainly to three areas: (i)  participating
banks might not meet the investment targets; (ii) the technical assistance
component may not reach the intended level of quality; and (iii) BDET
portfolio may not recover as early as expected. Concerning investment levels,
economic policies have been clarified and measures taken under ITPAL. These
reforms should ensure better investments and make existing and new operations
more efficient and profitable. There are reasonable expectations that a
substantial pipeline of expansion, modernization and new subprojects would
materialize as a result of the macro and sector reform package agreed with the
Bank and the IMF. Concerning the technical assistance component, the project
builds on seven years of experience with API, the commercial banks and BDET.
The institutional strengthening of API (by incorporating CNEI and AFI) will
bring together all aspects of industrial promotion, while the decrease in its
regulatory authority should re-orient the institution toward assisting
entrepreneurs. API's management is determined to strengthen its assistance to
new entrepreneurs through a more active promotional role. The support by
bilateral sources for strengthening UTICA's organization to assist SMI
management and operations, will contribute to the improved operation of SMI
enterprises. The participating banks have in the last decade trained a
substantial number of staff in appraisal and supervision techniques, and this
knowledge will now be applied in an environment which provides more autonomy
to the banks. With less distortion coming from the macro framework, with
better institutional support for entrepreneurs as provided under the project
(through API and UTICA) and increased responsibility of commercial banks to
make investment decisions on their technical financial and economic merits,
investment quality should improve. Considering the past and expected future
dynamism of the sector and the project specific features (which should make
investment by, and lending to SMI attractive), project risks are acceptable.
Finally, the improvements expected in BDET's portfolio may not be achieved as
rapidly as expected. While BDET will do all it.can to implement the
organizational and managerial reforms required to improve its role in the
rehabilitation of its clients, economic policies would here again play a major
role and results would be contingent on the performance of ITPAL.
VL AGREEMENTS
6.01     During negotiations, the following agreements were reached for the
proposed loan.
A- bacorporated in the Legal Documents
I.  Loan Agreement
(a) The loan will be made to the Government on the standard
conditions applicable to Tunisia, i.e. repayment schedule of 17
years including a grace period of 4 years (para 5.03);
(b) The loan will be onlent, through subsidiary loan agreements
acceptable to the Bank, to the participating banks at the Bank
lending rate in effect at the time that the Loan Agreement

fraction of the loan as indicated in para. 5.05; however, the
amount allocated to each bank may be revised on the basis of an
annual review, the first to be held 18 months after
effectiveness but not later than December 31, 1989 (para.
5.05). The onlending rate will be reviewed at least once a year
and may be adjusted by mutual agreement between the Government,
the participating banks and the Bank (para. 5.07). Bank funds
will be onlent to the participating banks in dinars (at the
exchange rate in effect on the date of disbursement by the
Bank). Participating banks will pay a 1% flat fee to cover the
foreign exchange risk, which will be passed on to the ultimate
borrower, until a new scheme is in place; the amounts onlent to
the participating banks will be reimbursed to the Government
according to the aggregate amortization schedules of individual
sub-loans (para 5.08);
(c) Participating banks will be allowed to charge an adequate margin
-- yet no larger than 4% -- on their lending to SMI
beneficiaries (para 5.08), resulting in an initial interest rate
of about 12% to be charged to subborrowers. This rate will also
be reviewed at the time of the review of the onlending rate
mentioned in (b) above;
(d) The Central Bank shall administer the loan, open a Special
Account (paras 5.13 and 5.16), and account for loans financed
under the project when enforcing the ratio of priority financing
(paras. 3.22 and 5.06). The Special Account will be audited
annually by independent auditors (para. 5.17);
(e) API will carry out the assistance program, including (i) the
hiring of a foreign er-gineer in accordance with Bank guidelines
(paras 3.31 and 5.15), and (ii) reporting periodically to the
Bank on its promotion activities (para 5.17);
(f) the Government will fund the Technical Assistance Program to
UTICA from bilateral sources and meet eventual shortfalls from
its own funds (para 3.19);
(g) The Government will seek the Bank's comment on the draft report
concerning the future of FOPRODI (para. 4.15); and
(h)  The Government will settle its arrears to BDET with respect to
the foreign exchange losses according to the arrangement
presented in para. 4.46.



- 58 -
II. Proiect Agreement
(a) The eligibility criteria for subprojects (para. 5.10);
(b) The format of appraisal reports of subprojects (para 5.11);
(c) The free limit of US$400,000 for Bank authorization of
subprojects (para 5.12);
(d) The procurement and disbursement procedures for subprojects
(paras. 5.15 and 5.16);
(e) Auditing and reporting requirements (para. 5.17); and
(f) The last date for submission of sub-loans will be December 31,
1991, and the Closing Date will be June 30, 1995 (para 5.16);
B. Condtions of Loan Effectiveness and Disburseme it
6.02     These will be:
I. For Effectiveness
(a) Signature of Subsidiary Loan Agreements between the Government
and the participating banks (5.08) acceptable to the Bank;
signature of the UTICA and API grant agreements (paras. 5.19 and
5.20);
(b) Payment by the Government of at least TD 15 million of its
arrears to BDET with respect to foreign exchange losses incurred
by BDET (para. 4.46); and
(c) Effectiveness of the Belgian grant agreement or confirmation of
availability of alternative financing from other sources (para.
5.20).
II. For Disbursement
Hiring of the expert engineer by API (para. 3.31).
6.03     Subject to these agreements, the proposed project will be suitable
for a Bank loan of US$28.0 million.

TUNISIA
SECOND SMI DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR SUPPORTING INSTITUTIONS
I. THE INVESTMENT PROMOTION AGENCY (API)1'
1.       Established in 1973, API is an autonomous public organization under
the aegis of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. At creation, the agency's
objectives were as follows:
(i)    to assist industrial investors in preparing and filling
licensing applications within the framework of existing
legislations;
(ii)    to review and approve all investments;
(iii)    to initiate research and studies on its own or in collaboration
with the National Center for Industrial Studies (CNF.I) or any
other public or private agency, domestic or foreign, with a view
to promote investments in Tunisia; and
(iv)    to disseminate information, both inside and outside Tunisia,
regarding investment opportunities.
2.       Since then, other objectives have been added (when the Government
decided to promote SMI) such as: (i) to assist small and medium-scale
promoters in improving their management and productivity; (ii) to inform
promoters about investment advantages in different sectors; and (iii) to help
develop subcontracting opportunities and decentralization. Because API used
to spend most of its resources on reviewing and approving investments, it was
not providing sufficient technical and managerial assistance to SMI. In 1978,
API created an Assistance Unit which was very helpful in solving problems of
new promoters; particularly, in obtaining authorizations to import capital
goods and raw materials, and building permits, utility connections, etc...
3.       Staffing and Organization.  As of iate 1987, API is organized into
five main operational departments: Promotion Department, Training Department,
Identification and Studies Department, Administrative and Financial Department
(for FOPRODI fiscal advantages and Immigrant workers), and Legal -d Follow-up
Department. The Promotion Department has a staff of 5 professionais. The
Promotion Department is in charge of bringing investors together, carrying out
public relations activities to foster investments, organizing international
gathering, assisting promoters of export-oriented companies (Law 72-38), and
following up activities of API's offices abroad. The Training Department,
which is operational since April 1986, has a staff of 3 professionals. It
plans to train API's professionals and organize seminars and training for new
promoters. Seminars (with durations between 3 to 4 weeks) would be conducted
by API professionals or students from the University. The concept is in a
preliminary stage and has not yet been tested. In any case, API is organizing
itself to be able to respond to new promoters' needs.
1/ Agence de Promotion des Investissements; now being reformed as indicated
in the body of the report (paras. 3.06-3.09).

Prge 2 of 8
4.       The Identification and Studies Department, which is subdivided into
sectoral branches, has a staff of 20 professionals. It reviews investment
proposals and prepares reports and recommendations to API's management for
approving or rejecting investment applications (on average 1,800 applications
per year). The Departident is also responsible for research and studies for
the identification of new projects, but spends only 52 of its time on this
function because investment approvals and rejections are a time-consuming
function. Nonetheless, API's management has decided to devote time to the
identification of new projects as it is considered one of API's main goals.
5.       The Administrative and Financial Department (DFA) for FOPRODI, 1/
Fiscal Advantages and Immigrant workers has a staff of 17 professionals. DFA
is subdivided into administrative divisions (Personnel, Administration,
Accounting, and Supplies) and 3 operational divisions (FOPRODI, Fiscal
Advantages and Immigrant workers). The FOPRODI Division, which was created in
1975, prepares demand applications to be reviewed by API's Board. API's Board
is responsible for giving Government funds to investors lacking personal
assets. (FOPRODI's approvals have decreased from 141 in 1982 to 76 in 1985
which shows that there are less opportunities for creation). The Fiscal
Advantages Division reviews demands for fiscal advantages submitted by service
companies such as hospitals, grocery stores, export companies, etc... This is
an administrative function which has been relegated to API by the Ministry of
Finance. The immigrant Workers Division is in charge of assistance to
returning Tunisian workers; it is an informative and administrative assistance.
6.       The Legal and Follow up Department (DJAS), which is subdivided into
four divisions (Legal, Assistance, Statistics and Follow up, and Computer
Services), is in charge of the 23 regional offices. DJAS has a staff of 23
professionals (excluding the regional offices). The Legal Division is
responsible for all legal work af API (minutes of Board negotiations, approval
of letters, etc..). The Assistance Unit which was created in 1979, is in
charge of assisting SMI promotion in cooperation with the regional offices.
The Unit provides assistance at four levels: (a) informing promoters of
available advantages; (b) helping prepare appraisal reports, requests for
FOPRODI financing and investment authorization; (c) assisting in overcoming
administrative procedures; and (d) facilitating relations with financial
intermediaries. The Bank is using this Unit to provide technical assistance
to promoters under the SMI line of credit (Loan 1969-TUN). The Statistics and
Follow-up Department oversees the implementation of all relevant industrial
projects. In principle, a project should be visited once a year during 4
years. The regional offices have responsibility for all investments below TD
200,000 (evaluation, review, approvals, etc...). In addition they are in
charge of follow up on all approved projects, and they handle public relations
with representatives of the government bodies.

7.       API's staff has been growing since creation of the agency; from 37 in
1973, to 360 in 1986.  Out of the 360 people, one-third are professionals, and
half are working in the regional offices. API's staff is less paid than in
the private sector, but API is perceived as a good training ground for young
graduates. As a result, API attracts only inexperienced people, and is
loosing its experienced staff to private sector and para-statal enterprises.
8.       Procedures.  API gives one approval for projects with investments
below TD 200,000 and two approvals for others. A first approval is given
before a bank evaluates a project; a second approval comes after a bank
decides to finance the project. API's second approval authorizes a promoter
to import his equipment (import liceuse); it also sanctions the overall
investment which is usually the amount approved by a bank. API has 3 approval
bodies. In principle, investment authorizations should be given by the
National Council for Investments (Le Conseil National de l'Investissement)
headed by the Prime Minister and composed of representatives of various
ministries. In practice, investment authorizations are given by API's Board,
headed by API's President.
9.       The Board is composed of representatives of the Prime Ministry,
Ministries of Finance, Planning, Commerce and Industries, and the Director of
the Central Bank. The representatives of the three technical centers (CETIME,
CMTCCV, CNCC), UTICA and CNEI sit on the Board of API as observers and cannot
vote; however, a rejection from an observer is detrimental to a project. In
case of rejection by the Board, the promoter can appeal to the National
Council for Investments; since API creation, only 2 cases went to the
Council. The Board meets once a month to give: (i) approvals (first and
second) to projects with investments above TD 500,000; (ii) first approvals to
projects with investments between TD 200,000 and TD 500,000.; (iii) approvals
of FOPRODI requests; (iv) approvals of fiscal advantages requests from service
enterprises; and, finally (v) to analyze appeals for projects rejected by "La
Commission Centrale d'Approbation".
10.      Institutions represented in API's Board are those which sit on "La
Commission Centrale d'Approbation" (Central Approval Committee), but the
repre..entatives in the Committee have lower positions than the ones sitting on
the Board of API. "La Commission Centrale d'Approbation" meets once a week to
give final approvals to projects with investments under TD 500,000 and to
projects already approved which need an increase in investment size. "Les
Commissions d'Approbation Regionales" (Regional approval committees) operate
like "La Commission Centrale d'Approbation", but at the regional level.
11.      Since its creation, API has played an important and valuable role as
a Governments regulatory agency (about 18,000 projects were approvea).
However, API has to reassess its objectives and reduce its regulatory role to
respond to the Government new economic policy orientations which are:
reduction of production cost, export orientation, more local competition and
progressive liberalization (see ITPAL and ASAL). Under the new investment
Law, put in place in mid 1987, API would only approve projects which will
request government support. In this regard, the present managing director of
API is in the process of reemphasizing the assistance role of API, especially
with regards to new promoters.

II. UNION TUNISIENNE DE L'INDUSTRIE, DU COMMERCE
ET DE L'ARTISANAT (UTICA)
12.      Created in 1946, UTICA is the federation of Tuniisian employers, as
well as the major organization promoting the interests of private business.
UTICA main functions is to promote the interest of the private sector; in
doing so, it improves contacts of the business community with the Government
and gives its views on questions of industrial policy and reglementations. It
is divided into subqectoral groupings for each economic activity and includes
a permanent executi4e office which is in charge of managing the association.
UTICA is composed of 120 sectoral chambers (of which half are related to the
industrial sector); the employers are grouped on the basis of their
activities. UTICA has a network all over the country. In each of the 23
governorates, there is a regional branch of UTICA which is the grouping of
regional sectoral chambers. In Tunis, the headquarters, the federations which
group at the national level all the chambers, are the following: textiles,
electrical and mechanical, construction, leather and shoes, paper, food
processing and export (created in July 1985).
13.      Every five years, there is a general assembly, at which employers
review the statutes of the association and elect the twenty members of the
executive office. The association's expenses are financed by dues (TD 5 to
200) determined by the chambers which have annual budgets between TD 10,000 to
TD 30,000. UTICA's operating cost is about MD 1 million per year. UTICA's
budget is covered through a para fiscal tax of 0.5% on salaries. The total
tax collected is put in a special account managed by the Prime minister who,
in turn, allocates a certain amount to UTICA to cover its operating cost. As
a result, UTICA is a federation of employers, but appears as an extension of
the Central Administration.
14.      UTICA has a permanent staff of 150 people (of which 2/3 are working
at headquarters).  The permanent staff is organized into seven departments:
Industry and Handicrafts, Prices and Commerce, Labor Relations, External
Relations, Internal Relations Department, Training and Promotion, and
Publication.
15.      The Departments of Industry and Handicrafts, Prices and Commerce, and
Labor Relations are responsible for dealing with the Government on questions
related to price controls, investment promotion, credit policy, labor laws
etc... They also initiate sectorial studies (upon request of members) and
provide assistance to promoters in administrative procedures. The Department
of External Relations organizes regional and international gatherings.
16.      The Training and Promotion Department, the most recent, is in charge
of disseminating information, and providing training and managerial
assistance. It provides promoters with updated information about all
enterprises in Tunisia. (It has a data base of nearly 5,000 firms, of which
most are SMI). It produces articles and magazines to keep firms informed
about new developments and laws. It provides training through its training
center created in 1977 with a grant from the Konrad Adenauer foundation. The
center organizes 20 to 30 seminars each year (of 1 day duration on average).



- G64 -                  ANNEX 1
Page 5 of 8
Seminars provide training through teaching on various management subjects such
as production, inventory, personnel and marketing. Seminars are conducted by
university professors, professionals from banking and specialized
institutions. Promoters pay a small price: TD 10 per day. The training
program has been well received by entrepreneurs, specially medium-size firms.
17.      Although UTICA does not have the resources to handle technical and
other extension services to SMI, it has done it successfully through an
experimental program financed by USAID and assisted by CRS (Catholic Relief
Services). Since 1984, UTICA created an Assistance Unit for SMI (Centre
d'Assistance a la PME) under the Training and Promotion Department. With the
assistance of CRS, the Unit has developed a two-year program to help 60 hand-
picked, very small (less than 20 employees) enterprises in three sectors
(Textiles and Garments, Electrical and Mechanical Industries, and
Construction). The program consists of 3 phases: diagnosis of the firm;
proposed solutions; and implementation of proposed solutions. Three full-time
consultants and four specialized short-term advisors from UTICA provide the
desirable expertise; whenever necessary, technical centers and/or consultants
are called upon. UTICA has agreed with USAID and CRS to extend the program
for 2 more years.
18.      UTICA focuses an important part of its efforts on medium and small
scale Tunisian businesses. Through its regular contacts (at the regional
level) with firms, UTICA knows their needs and promotes their interests.
UTICA strongly wishes to expand further its assistance to SMI; this, in view
especially of the changing economic environment (reduction of oil revenues,
reduced Government protection, saturation of local market etc...) and the
success of the Assistance Unit. UTICA's Congress which met in November 1985
has decided to develop assistance services to SMI in order to help them
modernize and expand, the objective being to assist 300 enterprises per year
on average
III. THE TECHNICAL CENTRE FOR ELECTRICAL AND
MECHANICAL INDUSTRIES(CETIME) 1/
19.      CETIME is an autonomous public institution under the aegis of the
Ministry of Industry and Commerce; it was created with the assistance of the
Bank in late 1982. Its role was to address the needs of two priority
subsectors, steel structure/plateworks and mechanical works, where the
potential for efficient projects were high and needs for technical assistance
were the most urgent. The range of services offered to entexprises were
mainly:
a.   In-plant guidance and trouble-shooting to resolve production problems
(e.g., reorganize plant layout and work flows; remove bottlenecks;
improve product quality; demonstrate to workers and technicians
appropriate and more efficient practices with regards to machinery
and tools utilization as well as their maintenance);
1/ Centre Technique des Industries Mecaniques et Electriques.



- 65 --                  ANNEX 1
Page 6 of 8
b.   Assistance to firms in their efforts to rationalize existing product
mix, to adapt/adopt new and appropriate products and technologies, to
plan and prepare new or expansion investments; and
c.   On-the-job training of technicians, in-plant demonstration of tools
and techniques, and advice on design/improvement of cutting tools and
die-metals.
20.      CETIME's Board is composed of 9 members, of which 3 are from small
and medium-scale industries. CETIME is organized in 4 operational
departments: Machining, Welding, Electricity and Electronics, and Quality
Control and Development. CETIME is well managed and most companies surveyed
are satisfied with the services provided to them. CETIME has a core staff of
30 Tunisians (21 engineers and 9 technicians) assisted by 4 foreign experts:
1 electrical engineer, 1 mechanical engineer, and 2 technicians experienced in
steel structure/plateworks, welding, tooling and dies.
21.      In 1985, CETIME carried out about 50 technical assistance
interventions, provided advice to 350 enterprises and trained 20 technicians.
CETIME charges firms for part of its services (essentially the time of staff
on assignment and a small fraction of overheads). This way, it covered 53% of
its operating cost (TD 760,000) in 1985. SMI have been receiving most of the
technical assistance from CETIME (especially through its regional workshop in
Sousse).  Out of the 400 enterprises identified in the EMI sector by CETIME,
200 are SMI. This is a good coverage because 652 of all EMI enterprises have
less than SO workers. CETIME has been providing technical assistance to SMI
through API. In 1985, CETIME spent 40Z of its technical assistance budget
reviewing requests for investment authorization submitted to API. CETIME sits
on the,Board of API as an adviser and gives its opinion about EMI projects.
22.      CETIME decided to extent its activities into two new branches
(foundries and electronics), and to improve and expand further its services in
the mechanics branch. For this, CETIME received from the Bank US$2.1 million
under the EMI II Loan in 1985.
IV. THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR LEATHER AND FOOTWEAR (CNCC) 1/
23.      Created in January 1969, CNCC is an autonomous public institution
under the aegis of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The Center's main
objectives are the following:
to develop, promote and regulate the subsector;
to help promoters improve ,roduction, product quality and
productivity;
to assist firms in their efforts to adopt new and appropriate
techniques, and to plan and prepare new and expansion
investments;
1/ Centre National du Cuir et de la Chaussure.



- 66 -                    ANNEX 1
Page 7 of 8
-      to initiate research and studies for better use leather and
prevent deterioration of hides;
-      to provide training, on-the-job and abroad ; and
-      take participations in enterprises or groups of enterprises
public or private with a view toward achieving the above
objectives.
24.      The Center's Board is composed of 11 members 4f which 6 are from the
private sector. CNCC has a core staff of 20 engineert md technicians with no
foreign experts; since the UNDP financed technical assistance in 1977-1981,
the Center has not received any technical assistance. Specialists are hired
when needed. CNCC's budget is covered by a 1.5% parafiscal tax on sales of
enterprises which are in the shoes and leather subsectors; in 1985, the Center
received TD 350,000 for operating cost and TD 350,000 for equipment.
Recently, CNCC has started charging its clients small amounts (staff time,
essentially) for its services .
25.      The Center provides direct assistance and indirect assistance through
API. In 1985, CNCC carried out 33 technical assistance interventions (of
which 26 were in the shoes subsector and 8 in the leather subsector), and
visited and advised 18 enterprises subcontracting to the sector. The Center
provided training for 9 engineers (in France and Italy); it also created
(in-house) new shoe design for enterprises. The center assists about
one-third of the sector (CNCC has identified 100 industrial enterprises of
which 901 are SMI and 4,500 handicrafts). CNCC is a member of API's Board,
and helps promoters prepare their requests for investment authorization and
gives its opinions about investment decisions.
26.      CNCC delivers limited assistance to SMI partly because CNCC is seen
as an extension of thc fiscal body which SMI avoid at all costs. CNCC is the
Government watchdog of the subsector. It proposes prices which are benchmark
for price controls, determines standards, gives its opinion about new,
modernization/rationalization investments, and proposes any changes that (in
its opinion) would contribute to the development of the sector.
V. THE TECHNICAL CENTER FOR BUILDING MATERIALS,
CERAMICS AND GLASS (CTMCCV) 1/
27.      CTMCCV is an autonomous public institution under the aegis of the
Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The Center's main objectives are the
following:
(i)     to provide technical assistance to enterprises;
(ii)     to initiate research and studies;
(iii)     to disseminate information inside and outside the subsector; and
(iv)     to do testing of minerals.

- 67 -                 ANNEX 1
Page 8 of 8
28.      Created in May 1982, CTMCCV started its operations a year later.  It
is not fualy operational and rely on CETIME for most of its work (mechanical
and electrical). CTMCC is governed by a Board of Directors which includes
representatives of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, commercial banks,
the Government training school (Office National de la Formation) as well as
members of the private sector. CTMCCV has a staff of 21 people, of which 10
are engineers and technicians. The Center's budget is financed by a 0.5%
parafiscal taxes on sales of all enterprises operating in the subsector. The
amount should have been TD 900,000 in 1985 (based on CTMCCV's records), but
the Center received only TD 150,000. CTMCCV plans to bill its clients (who
are not paying their 0.51 taxes) for services.
29.      CTMCCV has provided little technical assistance to SMI but it plans
to do so in the coming years. Its technical assistance work program includes:
(i) direct technical assistance interventions; (ii) training of technicians;
and (iii) visits to enterprises. During its two year activities, the Center
has already gained the reputation of a controller; mainly because CTMCCV is on
the Board of API and, in 1985, rejected about one-third of all requests for
investment authorization (concerning the subsector) presented to API's Board.

SECOND SMI DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Technical Assistance Program for API
This program will have the following components:
1.       Information Services.  There are in Tunisia no recent data available
pertaining to existing SMI, and old data have not been collected in a
systematic manner. To effectively assess the needs of the SMI subsector, an
accurate information data base should be available. Therefore, under this
project, API will collect information dealing with legislation, regulation,
assistance and taxation affecting SMI. It will collect, process and analyze
data on SMI using an inter-firm comparison technique. It will also
disseminate information and data whether obtained in the course of its own
activities or from foreign publications. To accomplish this task, API will
need 6 microcomputers, with 27 terminals and related software. The
microcomputers will expedite the collection, storage and retrieval of
inform"tion, as well as the transmission of data, messages and reports, and
provide better management control on information processes and extension
services. This package will also include one photocopier and desk-top printer.
2.       Extension Services.  API will provide two kinds of extension
services:(i) assistance to commercial banks; and (ii) assistance to
promoters. Under the credit line, commercial banks will have full
responsibility for appraising and financing SMI projects. Although each bank
will set up its own organizational structure to appraise subloan applications
from SMI, they believe that they will need (especially, at the beginning of
the loan) assistance in economic aspects of project appraisals. Consequently,
at the request of the commercial banks, API will help them assess the economic
feasibility of projects (market and product studies, economic rates of return,
etc.) and analyse the macroeconomic soundness of projects to be financed under
the credit line. Some SMI promoters are not yet able to prepare feasibility
studies/reports on new or expansion projects for submission to commercial
banks for financing; at the recjuest of such promoters, API will help them
formulate their projects. Under the loan, the Bank will finance an expert and
consultant services necessary to carry out the above described extension
services.
3.       Overseas training of staff.  An essential prerequisite of development
of an effective technical assistance program is the building up of a core
group of competent and dedicated staff in the SMI Unit. The program provides
resources for staff training and development. Training tours for API
professional staff responsible for SMI will be provided to visit (mainly, in
developing countries) industrial extension organizations to observe
administrative policies, procedures and programs; this will assist in creating
and maintaining in API a better understanding of SMI extension services.
Training tours would include working assignments and short tours of export
oriented industries, as well as training in management information systems for
extension services. The training tours would be made in the 1988-1990 period.

Page 2 of 2
4.       Studies and Proiect promotional work.  Under the new investment law,
API will devote most of its resources to promotional work. The SMI subsector,
more than any other manufacturing subsector, needs a significant promotional
effort. Under this project, API will have an important promotional role to
play. It is certain that API cannot and should not expect to assume the role
of the entrepreneurs in identifying new market opportunities or potentially
successful new products or processes. But it could facilitate the
entrepreneurs' task by carrying out technical, economic and market studies for
products where opportunities exist either for export or technological
innovation. API would be able to provide this service since it will be merged
with CNEI  -'.  It would obtain knowledge of the production capacity of SMI
and of its informational and promotional needs. Under its promotional role,
API will assess the potential for establishment of a close and beneficial link
between large industrial enterprises and SMI through subcontracting and
marketing arrangements.
