MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RE'0ONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR A SECOND SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan of US$28.0 million to the
Republic of Tunisia is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would have
a term of 17 years, including 4 years of grace, at the standard variable
interest rate. It would help finance viable small and medium scale
industrial enterprises (SMI) through a credit line of $27.5 million to five
participating banks. The project also ixucludes technical assistance ($0.5
million) to assist SMI in formulating and designing investment projects and
in resolving managerial and technical protlems, and to help the participating
banks in improving their appraisal and supervision of SMI projects.
2.       Backaround.  Small and medium scale industries are estimated to
comprise about 851 of all manufacturing enterprises in Tunisia and to employ
over 65% of the labor force in the manufacturing sector. They are
concentrated in traditional sectors like textile/leather and food processing
but are now becoming important in the modern electro-mechanical sector which
has become the third most important in terms of SMI investment and
employment. The Government is interested in further developing the SMI
sector, inter alia as a source of employment since the cost of creating a new
job in SMI averages about TD 8,500 (US$10,700) i.e. less than 402 of the
average for the industrial sector as a whole or less than 201 of the average
for larger enterprises. The proposed project builds on the experience of a
pilot project (Loan 1504/1505, approved in 1977) and of the SSI project (Loan
1969-TUN, approved in 1981) which have contributed to a better understanding
of the strengths and constraints of the SMI subsector. In particular, it has
brought to light the weaknesses in the institutional and financial support
system. API (Agence de Promotion des Investissements). which is responsible
for industrial promotion, has become inflexible and more concerned with
regulatory matters than with promotion, while FOPRODI (Fonds de Promotion et
de Decentralisation Industrielles), which provides financial assistance to
SMI, has become too lax in its financing standards and criteria. The project
addresses these weaknesses (paras. 4-6). The Government is already
undertaking economy-wide and sectoral reforms under the Agricultural Sector
Adjustment Loan (ASAL) and the Industrial and Trade Policy Adjustment Loan
(ITPAL), both approved in 1986, which are expected to provide the economic
environment required for sound SMI development. Specifically, these reforms
aim at: (i) expanding exports to offset the country's declining oil revenues,
and (ii) reducing the present high levels of unemployment and
underemployment. The Government places high priority on the growth of SMI as
a means of achieving improvements in these two areas.



- 2 -
3.       Project Obiecti"c^s.  The proposed project would finance eligible SMI
investment projects through a credit line to three commercial banks and two
development banks. Through the promotion of SMI enterprises, the project
would foster the development of a new class of industrial entrepreneurs and
create employment in economically sound projects at a relatively low cost.
The proposed project will provide medium- and long-term finance to SMI
through the commercial banking system. Under the project, this type of
financing will become more attractive to the banks and will enable them to
improve the quality of financial services and assistance to SMI. Technical
assistance, which is critical to SMI development, would (i) help commercial
banks develop the necessary expertise to improve their support to SMI; and
(ii) assist SMI in designing new extension/modernization projects and in
resolving their operational problems. The project will also assist BDET
(Economic Development Ban!' of Tunisia), one of the participating banks, in
strengthening its financial situation which has been impaired by Government
arrears related to foreign exchange losses, and by a weak portfolio,
especially with respect to loans in arrears many of which concern public
sector enterprises and the tourism sector.
4.       Proiect Description.  The proposed project would consist of a credit
line of US$27.5 million, divided among three commercial banks and two
development banks (BDET and BTEI) which are active in the financing of SMI.
Based on a review of each bank's subproject pipeline, its past volume of
activity and a reasonable estimate of future growth, it is expected that the
participating banks will be able to utilize, in the next three years, their
share of the credit line, i.e. US$ 6.5 million for BDET, Us$ 6.0 million for
STB, as well as for BS, US$ 5.0 million for BT and US$ 4.0 million for BTEI.
The utilization of the loan :unount will be reviewed after 18 months and, if
needed, a reallocation may be undertaken in agreement with the Government,
the participating banks and the Bank. Proceeds of the proposed loan would
finance new SMI enterprises with total investment not exceeding TD 1.5
million (US$1.9 million) and existing enterprises with total investments for
expansion, modernization, diversification/integration or
rehabilitation/restructuring not exceeding TD 2.5 million, including net
existing investments. Eligibility criteria for SMI subprojects would include
inter alia an economic rate of return of 102 per year, a financial viability
test showing the enterprise's ability to pay interest and reimburse the loan,
and a combination of indicators including employment creation and export
orientation. The Bank loan would be made to the Government at the standard
IBRD variable interest rate and would be onlent to the participating banks in
local currency at the interest rate charged by the Bank at the time of
signing of the loan documents. The banks would onlend the Bank funds to
eligible SMI at cost, plus a margin of not more than 42, to provide for about
2% overheads, 1% provision for losses and 12 profit. The foreign exchange
risk will be covered by the Government, the participating banks paying to the
Government a 1% flat fee which they will charge to subborrowers. On this
basis, the interest rate paid by the subborrowers will be about 12X per year,
which is similar to other local rates for term loans, and is strongly
positive in real terms when compared to expected inflation of 72 for the
period 1987-1990. The onlending interest rates to the banks and the
subborrowers for new commitments will be reviewed once a year and adjusted on
the basis of changes in the Bank's lending rate, the level and structure of
interest rates in Tunisia (particularly, the interest rate on long-term
funds), the prevailing inflation rate, the demand for long-term funds, the
utilization of the Bank loan and overall liquidity in the banking system.



5.       Technical assistance (US$0.5 million) would be provided to API, the
regulatory role of which has been reduced under ITPAL and which will, under
the proposed project, reorient its activities towards the promotion of new
enterprises. The technical assistance would consist of the provision of an
expert engineer, equipment and training to its technical assistance
directorate, to help new entrepreneurs in the design of their projects.
Technical assistance would also be provided to UTICA, the Tunisian employers'
federation, by the provision of training and operating support to its Centre
d'Assistance a la PME; this technical assistance is expected to be finar,ced
by bilateral sources. The project also proposes a program of actions to
strengthen BDET's financial situation. Amounts and methods of procurement
and disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank group
operations in Tunisia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The
Staff Appraisal Report (Number 6752-TUN) dated January 12, 1988 is being
distributed separately.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has assisted the Tunisian
Government in its policy adjustment efforts through intensive macroeconomic
and sectoral dialogue (Synopsis Paper, Financial Sector Report, Industrial
Policy Report, Industrial Employment Report), and with concrete policy
measures being implemented under ASAL and ITPAL. The project is consistent
with, and expected to benefit from, these policy changes and the continued
macroeconomic dialogue. In addition to policy-based sectoral lending, there
is a need for project lending to support investments in priority areas. The
proposed project helps to pursue, in particular, objectives in the areas of
employment creation, promotion of new industrial activities and technological
innovations.  Through the support of the commercial banks, the project aims
at a more efficient mobilization and allocation of financial resources for
SMI. As proposed in the Financial Sector Report (Report No. 5263-TUN dated
December 16, 1985), the Government has agreed that the minimum long- and
medium-term lending by commercial banks be reduced from 18% to 102 of sight
and term deposits and that this ratio apply for the SMI, export and
agriculture sectors. In the past, most of this lending was directed to
larger and often publicly owned enterprises. The project also intends to
bring about changes in FOPRODI, in order to make its interventions more
effective and promotional, while strengthening its management and loan
recovery. A study to this effect will be undertaken under the project.
7.       Agreed Actions.
(a)  With regard to the technical assistance program, the Government has
agreed that the main vehicles for assistance to SMI will be UTICA
and API. The signatures of the API and UTICA grant agreements are
conditions of effectiveness; so is the confirmation of the
availability of funds from bilateral and other sources to finance
the UTICA component;



- 4 -
(b)  With regard to the credit line, the proposed onlending terms and
conditions - as presented in the Project Description and reflected
in subsidiary loan agreements between the Governments and the
participating banks -- were agreed with the Government,with the aim
of improving and simplifying financial intermediation to SMI and
increasing the responsibility and financial interest of the
participating banks in SMI investments. Signature of the subsidiary
loan agreements will be a condition for effectiveness;
(c) With regard to the SMI subsector, the Government agreed that: (i) a
study for the reform of FOPRODI be undertaken, the results of which
will be discussed with the Bank before finalization; and (ii)
subloans made from the proceeds of the Bank loan qualify for
inclusion in the "priority activities ratio"; and
(d) With regard to BDET, the following action was agreed upon to
strengthen BDET's financial situation: payment by the Government,
over a maximum of two years, of its arrears on account of BDET's
foreign exchange losses. Payment of TD 15 million would be a
condition for effectiveness, and the remainder as of late 1987 (TD
13.8 million) would be paid before December 31, 1989; future
accruals not covered by a new foreign exchange coverage scheme
presently being studied under ITPAL would be paid with a maximum
delay of two years.
8.       Justification and Risks.  This prcject provides technical assistance
and financial support at a critical time of adjustment to a subsector which
should be an engine of growth, employtent and export creation and
diversification. The main risks involved are that, for macroeconomic
reasons, SMI investments might not proceed at the levels now projected. This
risk will be mitigated by the fact that there is already a substantial
pipeline of subprojects which should increase as a result of the macro and
sector policy reform program supported under ASAL and ITPAL. Considering the
past and expected future dynamism of the sector and the special features of
the proposed project which should make investment by and lending to SMI
attractive, project risks are acceptable.
9.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

Estinated Costs and FinanDing Plan
Estimated Costs.    The proposed loan consists of lines of credit to five
Tunisian banks for on-lending to eligible SMI
subprojects. It is estimated that the fund. provided
under the proposed loan would help to finance about US$70
million of investments in the SMI sector.
F=euivgA Pgaw       The lines of credit to the participating banks would
finance about 452 of investment costs of eligible
subprojects (including permanent working capital) which
corresponds to the estimated foreign exchange component
of SMI projects in Tunisia. Investors would contribute
an average of about 35% to the total cost of the
investment in the form of equity or internal cash
generation, with the balance of about 202 contributed by
the participating banks.

Schedule B
Procurement and Disb'sements
Procurement             Procurement under the investment subprojects would
follow the procedures used under previous Bank lines of
credit through the banking system in Tunisia, which
have been satisfactory. Purchases would be made on the
basis of a comparison of at least three quotations from
suppliers or contractors. As in the past, this is
expected to lead to international bidding or sho'ning.
Procurement for the technical assistance component
would be done on the basis of Bank Guidelines on the
use of consultants.
