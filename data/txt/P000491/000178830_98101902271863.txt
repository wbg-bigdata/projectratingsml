REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHAD
FOR A RURAL PROJECTS FUND
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Chad for the equivalent of US$12.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Rural Projects Fund. FAC,
the French aid agency would participate in the financing of the project with
a grant of about US$1.0 million equivalent.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Background
2.        A report entitled "Chad's Economic Development:  Constraints and
Potential" (75a-CD) was distributed to the Executive Directors in July 1973.
An economic mission visited Chad in April 1976 to review recent developments
and to assess medium-term development prospects. Its preliminary conclusions
are reflected in the following paragraphs. Annex I contains Country Data.
3.        With scarce natural resources, a harsh climate, limited social
and economic infrastructure and a pervasive lack of skilled manpower, Chad
faces unusually large handicaps in its economic development. High cost
of transportation to and from the outside world compounds the problem:
the main centers of activity of this vast landlocked country are about 2,000
km from the sea; freight rates from the port of Douala in Cameroon to Southern
Chad were about US$130/ton for bulk goods and US$180/ton for general goods
in early 1976.
4.        With a 1975 per capita GNP of US$120 Chad is one of the poorest
countries in Africa and is classified as one of the world's 25 "least developed"
countries by the United Nations. Close to 90 percent of the population, es-
timated at about 4 million, lives in rural areas deriving their livelihood
from agriculture and livestock. About half the rural population lives in the
south-west or cotton zone, where average rainfall is about 1,000 mm/year and
grows millet and sorghum as food crops and cotton as a cash crop. The other
half are mainly pastoralists living in the dry grassland belt, with lower and
less reliable rainfall. Recently, efforts have been made to intensify tradi-
tional rice growing on the flood plains of the Logone River.
5.        During the 1960s, real GDP increased about 2 percent annually.
The highest growth rates were achieved in the market economy (mainly import
substitution industries and services), while the growth of livestock and
subsistence crops probably did not reach that of population, estimated at

- 2 -
about 2 percent per year. Income disparities were relatively wide and appear
to have widened between the small urban sector and the rural areas and, within
the rural population, between producers of cash crops and the rest.
Recent Developments
6.        Three events have affected economic growth and the financial sit-
uation since the late 1960s: the internal security problems, the drought
and the deterioration in the terms of trade. The rebellion that broke
out in 1968 made large areas insecure and cut traditional cattle routes.
Due to lack of security and maintenance funds, wells were neglected and
the water supply for livestock dwindled. Animal disease control suffered
a setback. The impact of the internal security problems was compounded by
severe droughts, which occurred in three of the five years, 1969-1973. Water
levels in the rivers reached an all-time low, and Lake Chad shrunk to one-
third of its normal size. Livestock losses were substantial, notably in
cattle and sheep. Food crops were also hard hit; production of millet and
sorghum fell to about 70 percent of pre-drought levels in 1972 and to about
60 percent in 1973. Emergency food shipments from abroad helped the hard
hit areas. With the return of normal rainfall, food production recovered to
pre-drought levels in 1974/75.
7.        Cotton production picked up considerably in 1974 and reached a
record volume in 1975 (175,000 tons); this was accompanied by a proportional
increase in the number of draft oxen used. The upturn in crop production
stimulated industry, transportation and trade. On the other hand, livestock
offtake, after surging in the drought years because of emergency slaughtering,
has substantially decreased, reflecting the reduction of the herd and the
beginning of its reconstitution. Moreover, the economy now feels the full
impact of the accelerated import price inflation in 1974-1975 and the concurrent
decline in export prices. Chad's terms of trade worsened by about Il percent
between 1972 and 1975 and are likely to deteriorate further in the years
ahead.
8.        Up to 1968, the budget was in balance and, in view of the country's
development constraints, fiscal performance could be considered satisfactory.
After 1968, however, expenditures began to grow much more rapidly than revenue
as military spending increased substantially (security and defense now account
for about one-third of the current budget.) The drought also increased de-
mand for Government services while it reduced revenue. Further contributing
factors were the continuous and recently accelerated inflation of import
prices and the rise in Government employment -- a means of containing unem-
ployment especially among school leavers. As a result, the overall budget
deficit (excluding capital expenditures financed by foreign aid) rose from
CFAF 2.0 billion (15.5 percent of revenue) in 1970 to CFAF 4.1 billion (30.5
percent of revenue) in 1974, but dropped to CFAF 2.1 billion (13.5 percent of
revenue) in 1975 due to special efforts to collect tax arrears and some reduc-
tion in spending. External budget subsidies partly covered these deficits. A
considerable gap remained, however, resulting in payments arrears accumulat-
ing to CFAF 11.6 billion (US$51 million) by the end of March 1976, of which



- 3 -
about 80 percent was due domestic suppliers and 20 percent due foreign
creditors.
9.        The continuous rise in budgetary expenditures has been exclusively
in recurrent expenditures; Government-financed investment -- about CFAF
1 billion until 1972 - has shrunk to virtually zero. The rise in current
spending would have been still much larger but for the progressive curtailment
of material supplies required for the operation and maintenance of Government
services. This has been particularly marked in economic services. In 1974,
for example, road maintenance expenditures were less than 1 percent of total
expenditures, and of the allocation for the Department of Agriculture and
Livestock (less than 5 percent of the budget total) all but 12 percent was for
wages and salaries. Because of the lack of essential material implements,
from stationery to spare parts, most Government services cannot function
effectively.
External Aid
10.       Since 1973, aid flows have been massive, grants alone about equalling
tax revenue in 1973 and 1975, and exceeding it by 24 percent in 1974. Total
disbursements of external aid in 1973-1975 were US$222 million, three-quarters
of which were grants. Aid from OPEC countries rose from zero in 1972 to 10
percent of the total aid in 1973 and 18 percent in 1975 (US$15 million).
Nearly two-thirds of official aid disbursements came from bilateral donors
(France, 52 percent; USA, 5 percent; Germany, 4 percent; Canada, 3 percent),
the remainder from multilateral sources (FED, 26 percent; UN organizations,
6 percent; IDA, 3 percent.) External aid financed practically all public
investments.
11.       The massive inflow of foreign aid almost offset the large deficits
in the goods and services account of Chad's balance of payments, so that its
position in the Operations Account with the Bank of Central African States
(BEAC) changed only insignificantly. At the end of March 1976, the foreign
exchange position on the Operations Account which reflects the largest part
of net foreign reserves was minus CFAF 1.3 billion.
12.       Since most foreign aid has so far consisted of grants, public exter-
nal debt is still relatively small, totalling US$163 million at the beginning
of 1976, of which US$70 million were disbursed. Disbursed IDA credits repre-
sented 16 percent of this amount. Debt service was estimated at US$6.3
million or 5 percent of export earnings in 1975. For 1976 projected debt
service, on existing debt will be US$9.4 million or 7 percent of export of
goods and non factor services; the debt service payments will peak at US$11.1
million or 6.6 percent of export of goods and non factor services in 1978 to
decline to its pre-1976 levels after 1980. While this would be manageable
in relatior to projected export earnings, the bulk of service payments would
have to come from Government revenues. At present Chad has already accumu-
lated payments arrears in external debt service of about US$10 million. To
cope with this problem Chad earlier this year set up a "Caisse Autonome
d'Amortissement," an agency in charge of public debt management whose
director reports directly to the Head of State.



-.4-
Development Prospects
13.       Chad's development potential lies primarily in agriculture.
Opportunities for productive employment in the urban areas will remain
small. But progress in the rural economy, even assuming political stabil-
ity and normal rainfall, will be slow. Recently, the Government announced
the discovery of oil in the north-western and southern parts of the coun-
try. However, it will take time to assess the size of the deposits and
the feasibility of their exploitation.
14.       The fiscal situation is a serious obstacle to development, since
the Government cannot contribute to the financing of required investments
nor finance all recurrent costs of ongoing and new high-priority projects.
The military government which took power in April 1975 is aware of the need
to re-examine current spending priorities. The narrow tax base and the
rising cost of maintaining even the present level of public services make
it unlikely, however, that budgetary savings can be generated during the
rest of the 1970s. In view of this constraint, Chad's poverty and its
modest growth prospects, external funds should be provided on the most
concessionary terms possible. Moreover, in the next few years foreign
aid agencies should consider financing a high proportion of total project
costs, including whenever feasible some recurrent costs.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CHAD
15.       Past and future Bank Group lending to Chad focus on agriculture
(including livestock) and transportation, as well as on the development of
the country's human resources. To date the Bank Group has extended nine
credits to Chad totalling US$37.2 million. 1/ Five of these credits were
for agriculture (including livestock), two for highway maintenance and im-
provement, and two for education. Five of the eight projects are either
completed or near completion; the others are progressing satisfactorily.
Delays have occurred in project implementation mainly due to lack of coun-
terpart funds but also because of design problems and late signing of con-
sultants contracts. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits
as of October 31, 1976, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
16.       In agriculture our main objectives are to help the Government
assure a sufficient food supply for a growing urban as well as the predo-
minantly rural population and to protect Chad's production base against
the vagaries of climate. In rainfed agriculture, past IDA lending has
been designed to raise rural productivity mainly through the provision of
infrastructure, equipment and storage facilities while in the Sahelian zone
1/   Includes supplementary financing of US$0.9 million approved in August
1973 for the two education projects; and US$8.0 million supplementary
credit approved in August 1976 for the Sategui-Deressia irrigation
project (not effective).



IDA is contributtng to the expansion of the livestock lndustry through the
rehabilitation and construction of pastoral wells. In irrigation IDA is
assisting in the financing of the Sategui-Deressia and Lake Chad Polders
projects which will produce rice, wheat and seed cotton. The proposed proj-
ect would continue our efforts in these areas.
17.       In transportation, we give priority to road maintenance and to
lmprovement of feeder roads and agricultural export routes. The road com-
ponent of the proposed project, like our Second Highway Project of 1974, is
desLgned to improve feeder roads; a possible third highway project, to be
appraised this fiscal year, would serve to improve and maintain the cotton
export routes. We are also considering projects in Chad which will improve
its transport links with the sea, although much of the Lmprovement will come
from transport lnvestments in the coastal countries.
18.       Two education projects financed by IDA in 1968 and 1971 assisted
the Government in training teachers, agriculturalists and technicians - the
most needed skills in the economy. In cooperation with two U.N. agencies,
we are currently preparing a third project to improve mainly primary educa-
tion facilities in rural areas. Chad's severe financial and man-power con-
straints limit educatLon investment opportunittes and necessitate special
arrangements for counterpart funds, technLcal assistance and recurrent
costs.
PART III - THE RURAL SECTOR
19.       The rural sector contributes about 55 percent to GDP and about
90 percent to exports, of which cotton, livestock and animal products, and
fish are the main commoditLes. Chad is normally self-sufficient Ln coarse
grains but imports of 30,000 tons/year were necessary during the 1972-1974
drought. The only agricultural products imported in any volume Ln "normal"
years are wheat and sugar.
Production
20.       Rainfed crop production, which ls concentrated in the south and
which becomes more precarlous towards the north of the country, is based
on family farms cultivating 2-3 ha. While subsistence food crops such
as millet, sorghum, and legumes are given first priority by farmers at plant-
ing time, there is a continuing expansion of cash crop production, predomi-
nantly cotton. Cotton production has increased from about 100,000 tons/
year in the mid-1960s through 1973/1974 to the record 175,000 tons in
1975/1976, mainly as a result of the productivity program financed with
FAC and FED assistance. The program provides effective extension and
Lnput distribution services and, lin 1975, reached over 40 percent of all
cotton farms. On these, yields were more than twice those obtained with-
out improved inputs. Chad lis now the leading cotton exporter Ln West
Africa.



- 6 -
21.       Irrigated crop production is relatively insignificant though the
potentially irrigable area is great. About 50,000 ha of paddy and wheat
are grown on land subject to uncontrolled flooding; only about 1,000 ha
have been equipped for controlled irrigation. Current paddy production
is about 40,000 tons/year and wheat production is about 7,000 tons/year;
in sum, this represents only about 7 percent of rainfed foodgrain produc-
tion in a normal year. Pilot irrigation schemes are being promoted by
Government, with IDA and other foreign assistance. The Sategui-Deressia
Project (Credit 489-CD) and the Lake Chad Polders Project (Credit 592-CD)
will increase the area equipped for irrigation by about 6,000 ha, and pro-
duction of paddy and wheat would thereby increase by about 15,000 tons/year.
22.       Livestock becomes the mainstay of the rural economy towards the
central Sahelian zone where milk is a major item of the subsistence diet.
Prior to the drought, the national herd consisted of about 4.5 million
cattle, 5 million sheep and goats, and over 1 million transport animals.
It is estimated that the 1973 drought has caused severe losses of about
30 percent in cattle and 20 percent in sheep. A livestock census under
FED auspices has just been completed and will provide a clearer picture
of this subsector. Biological limits to herd reconstitution imply that
pre-drought production levels of meat and milk will not be reached until
at least the mid-1980s.
Price Policy
23.       Almost all prices in Chad are determined by demand and supply
despite Government's attempts to intervene. When livestock prices began
to rise very sharply immediately after the drought, Government fixed max-
imum producer prices. In practice, however, livestock producer prices con-
tinue to be determined by markets in north-eastern Nigeria, which are the
main outlets for slaughterstock. Government is aware that its official
price policy is unrealistic and is reviewing it. Maximum producer prices
for the main crops announced in mid-1975 have been similarly ineffective.
The only producer price which Government can and dces control is cotton.
The only major subsidy program is for fertilizer and insecticide and asso-
ciated distribution costs for cotton. Because of export taxes and the oper-
ation of the price stabilization fund, however, the net effect in most years
is a transfer from producers to the public sector. The net incentive to
producers is nonetheless attractive.
Institutions
24.       The Ministry of Agricultural and Pastoral Development is responsible
for the agricultural sector. Ministries generally lack budgetary resources
and trained manpower. In contrast, there are numerous specialized and rela-
tively autonomous government agencies which usually have benefitted from
foreign technical and financial assistance and are better staffed than the
ministries. Their performance has, however, been mixed.



7-
Rural Sector Strategy
25.       Rainfed crops have the best development prospects in the agricultural
sector; most of the present production comes from dryland farming and there [s
much unexploited potential. Governnent's objectives for many years have been
to promote cotton and, to a much smaller extent, groundnuts. SLnce much of
the dryland farming area is drought-prone, however, Government is rightly
anxious to protect the country against food shortages in future drought years.
The irrigation potential in Chad is probably In excess of 200,000 ha, and
Government wishes to make fuller use of it, in order to diversify crop produc-
tion, to provide some insurance against drought and partly, too, to start
developing a high technology agriculture. While investing in two medlum size
schemes, Government is also keen to promote smaller, simpler schemes In which
the beneficiaries could more readily participate. In the livestock sector,
Governnent's traditional emphasis has been on animal health services and stock
watering, and marketing facilities for increased herd build-up and higher
offtake rates. This policy is now fully justified; after the drought, the
reconstitution of the herd is the immediate task. Large and sustainable
Lncreases in output, however, can only be achleved by grazing control and
[mproved husbandry. At the same time, Government recognizes the potential
of livestock in association with crops in the south, and tntends to promote
further the introduction of work oxen into smallholdings.
26.       The limited capacity of the planning and executing agencies hin-
ders the implementation of Government's generally sound policies for the
rural sector. Moreover, plans to provide better public services to the
rural sector will continue to be largely frustrated by meager revenues.
Some improvement can nonetheless be achieved by increased efforts to ob-
tain payment from direct beneficiaries of these limited services, partic-
ularly village and pastoral wells. Government recognizes the difficulty
of recoverirg costs for services that have been provided free in the past
(i.e. village water supply), even if only to a limited number of people,
but is now determined to achieve a far greater degree of cost recovery
from beneficiarles for specific services rendered.
27.       With its numerous worthwhile lnvestment components in rainfed
agriculture, in the livestock sector, in small-scale irrigation and rural
services the proposed project fits well in the rural sector strategy. The
Fund Management Unit and the internationally recruited key staff would
strengthen Government's ability to implement the relatively simple and
easily-replicated project components and to prepare new small rural proj-
ects. Thereby it could become a catalyst for a more effective flow of
funds into the rural sector.



PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
28.       The Government of Chad has requested IDA assistance to set up
a Rural Projects Fund which would finance seven small-scale rural sub-
projects. The project was identifLed by RMWA ln late 1974. An IDA mission
appraised the project in November/December 1975. A report entitled "Appraisal
of a Rural Projects Fund - Chad" No. 1194-CD dated October 27, 1976 ls being
distributed separately and a Credit and Project Summary ls attached to this
report as Annex III. Negotiations for the proposed credit were held in
Washington from August 4 to August 9, 1976 with a Chadian delegation led by
Mr. Kerim Togol, Minister of Economy, Planning and Transport.
Project Description
29.       The Rural Projects Fund (RPF) is intended as the first three-year
phase of a longer term program, and would lnclude finance for the preparation
of a second-phase project. The RPF would comprise:
(a)  the development and initial operation of 42 small-scale
pump irrigation perimeters (about 970 ha irrigated) and
five service centers along the northern Chari River;
(b) the construction of 200 warehouses in the Cotton Zone;
(c) the rehabilitation of a pastoral wells network (about 300
lined wells) in the Batha prefecture in the Sahelian zone;
(d) the establishment and initial operatlon of a tubewell
drilling and open well maintenance unit to serve villages
in three prefectures in the Cotton Zone, including the
rehabilitation of about 146 lined wells and the installa-
tion of about 110 tubewells to be operated by foot pumps;
(e) minor structural repairs and spot resurfacing spread over
about 1,200 km of feeder roads in the Cotton Zone;
(f) buildings and equipment for animal feed production and
poultry marketing near NDjamena;
(g) land improvements and water control works in bottomlands
(about 700 ha) in the Cotton Zone.
In addition, the project would finance a Fund Management Unit (FMU), technical
assistance, training seminars and consultants' services.



- 9-
Project Implementation
30.       Government would create FMU in the Ministry of Economy, Planning and
Transport (Section 3.02(a) of the draft Development Credit Agreement), consist-
ing of a Chadian Fund Manager, an internationally recruited Deputy Fund Manager
and supporting staff. The Fund Manager would report to an Interministerial
Governing Committee consisting of the Director Generals of the five relevant
ministries and the Director of Planning as Secretary (Section 3.03 of the
draft Development Credit Agreement). FMU would review detailed subproject
work programs, budgets and progress reports, bidding procedures and contracts.
It would monitor and evaluate all project-financed activities and would
identify and prepare a follow-up project.
31.       Subproject implementation would be undertaken by the national
rural development board (ONDR) for the small-scale irrigation and warehouses
subprojects; the rural water supply agency (SERARHY) for the pastoral wells
and village water supply subprojects; the Chad cotton company (COTONTCHAD)
for the feeder road subproject; the livestock production improvement center
(CMPA) for the animal feed/poultry marketing subproject; and the rural engi-
neering department (Genie Rural) and ONDR for the bottomland development
subproject. COTONTCHAD and these agencies are among the best organized and
staffed in the country. The ONDR, SERARHY and Genie Rural divisions which
are directly responsible for subproject implementation would nonetheless need
to be strengthened by technical assistance and additional local staff financed
under the proposed project.
Cost Estimates and Financial Arrangements
32.       Project costs for the three-year period beginning October 1976 are
estimated at US$13.4 million (net of taxes), with a foreign exchange component
of 55 percent. Project costs would include a physical contingency of 9 per-
cent of base cost (US$1.0 million) and provision for expected price increases
of 21 percent of base cost (US$2.2 million).
33.       It is proposed that an IDA credit of US$12.0 million be made to
the Government covering 90 percent of project costs. FAC would contribute
almost US$1.0 million, or 7 percent of project costs. The FAC contribution
would be made available pari passu with the proceeds of the proposed credit
and would finance 20 percent of the cost of two subprojects: small-scale
irrigation and bottomland development, as well as for the FMU. The remaining
project costs estimated at US$0.4 million or about 3 percent of project costs
would be contributed by final beneficiaries as onfarm inputs and equipment in
the case of the small-scale irrigation subproject and in cash corresponding
to 10 percent of tubewell installation costs in the case of the village water
supply subproject. Farmers in the small-scale irrigation and bottomland
development subprojects would also contribute unpaid voluntary labor valued
at about US$0.6 million, which is not included in the project cost estimates.
The IDA credit would be channelled through an account to be opened in the
name of the FMU at the BDT. FMU would allocate these funds as grants to the
agencies charged with sub-project implementation. Since Chad is unable to
prefinance project expenditures, IDA would provide a revolving fund, through
the FMU account at BDT, of US$0.5 million from the credit account. IDA



- 10 -
extended a US$0.5 million project preparation advance to Government on
October 11, 1976 to help complete project preparation. Recurrent costs of
the small scale irrigation and village water supply subprojects would be
recovered from beneficiaries; in the case of pastoral wells the Government
would prepare detailed proposals for cost-recovery once ongoing studies are
completed. Even if the beneficiaries fail to bear the recurrent costs the
Government cash flow would be positive from the third project year onwards.
Procurement and Disbursements
34.       Procurement of vehicles and equipment (estimated cost US$1.8 mil-
lion), building construction (estimated cost US$2.2 million), and materials
for force account works (estimated cost US$1.6 million), would be through
international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines in the
case of contracts over US$50,000; for building construction contracts, local
contractors would receive 7 1/2 percent preference. In the case of contracts
of less than US$50,000 but more than US$10,000, procurement would be through
competitive bidding in accordance with local procedures acceptable to IDA.
For contracts under US$10,000, direct purchasing would be employed. The
services of expatriate staff and consultants (estimated cost US$1.6 million)
would be obtained following procedures acceptable to IDA.
35.       The proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed to finance 80
percent of the cost of all items in those subprojects with FAC co-financing,
except for on-farm investments in the small-scale irrigation subproject, and
100 percent of the cost of all items in the other subprojects except for oper-
ating costs of village water supplies where disbursement would be made to
finance 40 percent of costs. Disbursements would cover vehicles and equip-
ment (US$1.8 million), buildings construction materials and skilled labor
(US$4.0 million), expatriate staff and consultants (US$1.4 million), local
staff salaries (US$0.9 million), operating costs (US$0.9 million), operating
costs of the village water supplies subproject (US$0.1 million), and work-
ing capital for the first year of each new small-scale irrigation perimeter
(US$0.2 million), all net of identifiable taxes. Up to US$0.5 million would
be used for refinancing the project preparation advance granted by IDA and
US$2.2 million would be unallocated. Except for the revolving fund, for which
certification of expenditures would be made available after withdrawal from
the Credit, disbursements would be made against import documentation, con-
tracts and certified records of expenditures. Any remaining undisbursed
funds would be made available for new subprojects to be identified and pre-
pared by FMU and to be approved by IDA.
Economic Benefits, Justification and Risks
36.       The major economic benefits of the proposed project would include:
cotton, wheat and sorghum production from small-scale irrigation; wet season
paddy production from bottomlands; increased meat and milk production from
pastoral wells; reduced losses of farm inputs arising from warehouses; the
re-opening of feeder roads and unit transport cost savings; and increased
throughput and unit cost savings in animal feed production and poultry mar-
keting. Cotton lint would be exported, wheat and paddy would substitute for
imports, and sorghum would help to meet the growing internal foodgrain de-
mand; incremental supplies of slaughter cattle would be exported mainly to



- il -
Nigeria, and sheep and goats would be consumed locally. Incremental milk
production would be used for subsistence. No marketing problems are antici-
pated.
37.       The project would also provide important social and institutional
benefits. For example, village wells would provide an assured and clean
water supply to people who would otherwise depend on small creeks that dry
up for several months per year and which may contain waterborne diseases;
and the local staff of the executing agencies would acquire on-the-job expe-
rience in the implementation of simple, easily-replicated rural works.
38.       The number of small farming or pastoral families likely to receive
increased incomes under the project would be about 47,000. An additional
26,000 families would benefit from improved village water supplies. In sum,
73,000 families or about 400,000 rural people of whom about half would be
Sahelian pastoralists, would receive direct tangible benefits from the proj-
ect. The per capita income levels of most project beneficiaries fall within
the range of US$55 to 65.
39.       The economic rate of return is estimated to be 11 percent for small-
scale irrigation, the base cost of which is US$2.5 million; 20 percent for
warehouses, the base cost of which is US$2.0 million; 19 percent for pastoral
wells, the base cost of which is US$1.1 million; 19 percent for feeder road
improvement, the base cost of which is US$1.2 million; and 14 percent for
bottomland development, the base cost of which is US$0.6 million. The over-
all rate of return of these subprojects, including the overhead cost of the
Fund Management Unit, which together account for 78 percent of total project
base cost, is 17 percent. This aggregate rate of return excludes the village
water supplies and the animal feed and poultry marketing subprojects for which
no meaningful rate of return could be estimated because of the predominance of
non-quantifiable benefits.
40.       The success of four of the seven subprojects depends on key expa-
triates; particularly intensive efforts are therefore being made through APMU
to recruit good staff. Appointment of such staff would be a condition of dis-
bursement (Schedule I paragraph 3 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Further difficulties could arise from the impossibility of undertaking rural
works outside the dry season (November/May), but the risk of delay in initial
operations is being reduced by recourse to the project preparation facility.
Problems of collection of fees from direct beneficiaries can be anticipated
for the pastoral wells and village water supplies subprojects and, although
to a lesser extent, for the small-scale irrigation subproject, despite the
intended efforts of the Government. Assurances in respect of appropriate
fee collection arrangements are included in Sections 3.11 (a), 3.13 (b) and
3.15 of the draft Development Credit Agreement. Since the RPF consists of
seven independent subprojects, the failure of one component would not have
serious repercussions on the others.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
41.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Chad
and the Association, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article V,
Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution
approving the proposed Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
42.       Features of the draft Development Credit Agreement of special
interest are referred to in paragraphs 30 and 40 of this Report. Additional
conditions of effectiveness provided for in Section 6.01 of the draft Devel-
opment Credit Agreement include creation of the Fund Manàgement Unit, the
Interministerial Governing Committee, the establishment of the Rural Projects
Fund account in BDT, the appointment of the Fund Manager, and assurances
satisfactory to the Association in respect of FAC financing. Appointment of
key staff for each of the irrigation, pastoral wells, village water supply
and bottomland development subprojects would be a condition of disbursement
for that particular subproject.
43.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
44.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 125      Highway Maintenance Project:   US$4.1 million Credit of
August 14, 1968; Effective Date: February 11, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The project consisted of (a) a 5-year program for highway mainten-
ance including technical assistance, the procurement of equipment and mate-
rials, repair shop extension, training of operators and mechanics , and
establishment of traffic data collection system; and (b) feasibility studies,
and if found justified, detailed engineering for the Djermaya-Djimtilo road.
The project was completed on December 3±, 1973 but two of its
components were not implemented: the training program was dropped at the
Government's request because the cost of the consultants' proposals ex-
ceeded the amount available under the credit. However, a comprehensive
training program is included in the second highway project. The feasi-
bility study for improvement of the Djermaya-Djimtilo road was completed;
however, detailed engineering found premature, has been deferred due to
low traffic volume.
Credit No. 126      Education Project: US$2.2 million Credit of August 29, 1968
(as amended); Effective Date: December 31, 1968; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976.
The Project consists of (a) the construction and equipping of a
teacher training college at Moundou and (b) the construction and equipping of
an agricultural technician training center at Ndjamena (transferred to Sarh
under Credit 251).
The teacher training college has been completed and put into opera-
tion and the credit fully disbursed in the first quarter of 1976 about two and
a half years behind schedule. Reasons for the delay have been (a) delay in
reaching agreement on each stage of design; (b) the need to revise the design
and negotiate with the lowest bidder because of cost overruns; and (c) the
need to amend the Credit Agreement to resolve the financial problems created
by the US dollar fluctuation and internal budgetary difficulties.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Credit No. 251     Second Education Project:   US$2.7 million Credit of
June 16, 1971; (as amended); Effective Date:
December 28, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The project consists of (a) the construction and equipping of a
secondary technical school at Ndjamena; (b) supply of complementary equipment
for the existing vocational training center at Ndjamena; (c) the transfer of
the agricultural technician training center, financed under Credit 126, from
Ndjamena to Sarh; and (d) a study of young farmers' training schemes.
The project is almost totally completed about 12 months behind
schedule due to (a) delay in reaching agreement on the educational and
architectural programs for the technical secondary school; (b) delay in
preparation of equipment lists; and (c) the need to amend the Credit Agree-
ment to resolve the financial problems created by the fluctuation of the
US dollar and lnternal budgetary difficulties. Lack of government funds for
recurrent costs may create operating problems.
Credit No. 309     Llvestock Development Project: US$2.2 million Credit of
May 31, 1972; Effective Date: November 28, 1972; Closing
Date: June 30, 1977.
The project now comprises: (a) the construction of 18 new pastoral
wells and the repair and rehabilitation of 18 existing wells in the Batha
prefecture; (b) the establishment of two well maintenance units, including
their operating costs for the first two years; and (c) special studies carried
out by a Livestock Development Unit (LDU) established with UNDP assLstance.
Although the credit became effective In November 1972, project
implementation was begun only following the Board's decision to finance 100
percent of project costs, net of duties and taxes, and to establish a revolv-
ing account, which became effective In March 1974. Well construction and
repairs are progressing satisfactorily and completion is expected by end 1976.
Well maintenance units are in operation. Studies on water extraction and
livestock taxation are being carried out by consultants. UNDP did not extend
its assistance to LDU, due to unsatisfactory results and this unit is now
lntegrated in the Livestock Services.
Credit No. 445     Drought Relief Fund Project: US$2.0 million Credit of
December 7, 1973; Effective Date; March 22, 1974; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976.
The project is designed to help people in areas affected by the
drought to re-establish their productive base; it comprises the following
eight subprojects: equipment, workshops, technical assistance and operating
costs for underground water development; equipment and operating costs for
"Genie Rural", "Water Survey Bureau", and "Land Development Department"
equipment, buildings and operating costs for the Livestock Service; con-
struction of warehouses; equipment and operating costs for a vegetable
growing pilot scheme; and equipment and operattng costs for the Planning
Department.

Physical execution of the project is satisfactory, with all of the
15 sub-projects completed or nearly completed.
Credit No. 489      Sategul-Deressia Irrigation Project: US$7.5 million
Credit of June 28, 1974; (as amended); Effective Date
January 27, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
The project covers the development of 11,000 ha in the Sategui-
Deressia plain under controlled flooding for rice production. It includes
(a) the construction of an intake on the right bank of the Logone River to
provide water for the whole irrigated area, protection dykes against high
floods, main canals and drains, feeder roads, buildings, a rice mill and
storage facllities, (b) strengthening of the project authority with manage-
ment staff, facilities and equipment and (c) agricultural research and in
service training.
Bids for civil works were called in August 1974 and June 1975 with
unsatisfactory results. Failure to obtain acceptable bids led the Government
to reformulate the project, adopting force account construction using a mix
of local labor and machines, and starting implementation with a 300 ha polder.
(Board Approval of Amendment to the Credit Agreement - IDA/R75-89, September
1975.) The 4 km long main intake canal and a 300 ha polder thus constructed
are now completed. The entire project has been reappraised and in view of
favourable results IDA has accorded a supplementary cred[t of US$8.0
million on August 10, 1976.
Credit No. 490      Second Highway Project: US$3.5 million Credit of June 28,
1974; Effective Date: March 7, 1975; Closing Date: June 30,
1980.
The project comprises (a) a five-year program for improvement and
maintenance of feeder roads in cotton growing areas; (b) pre-investment
studies for about 120 km of cotton export routes; (c) a two-year tralning
program for DPW staff; (d) technical assistance for the reorganization of
the road transport industry; (e) a two-year traffic count on about 2,000 km of
the most important roads; (f) reconditioning of ferry boats and their interim
maintenance over a three-year period; and (g) feasibility study for replace-
ment of ferry boats and Lmprovement of dock facilities.
Project implementation is about ten months behind schedule. However,
consultant contracts for the training program, pre-investment studies, and
implementation of the feeder road maintenance program are now effective.
Because of higher than anticipated rate of inflation, the delay in project
implementation, and the increased requLrement for construction materials, a
cost overrun ls expected. This will reduce the maintenance program financed
under the project.

Credit No. 592      Lake Chad Polders Proiect:   US$5 million Credit of
November 26, 1975; Effective Date: February 26, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
The project comprises rehabilitation or construction of irriga-
tion and drainage networks of two polders of about 1,200 ha., to permit
cotton and wheat cultivation.
Project implementation is progressing satisfactorily.

Procurement
Arrangements:     Procurement of vehicles and equipment (estimated cost
US$1.8 million), building construction (estimated cost
US$2.2 million), and materials for force account works
(estimated cost US$1.6 million), would be through inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with IDA
guidelines in the case of contracts over US$50,000; for
building construction contracts, local contractors would
receive 7-1/2 percent preference. In the case of con-
tracts of less than US$50,000 but more than US$10,000,
procurement would be through competitive bidding in
accordance with local procedures acceptable to IDA. For
contracts under US$10,000, direct purchasing would be
employed. The services of expatriate staff and consul-
tants (estimated cost US$1.6 million) would be obtained
following procedures acceptable to IDA.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHAD
FOR A RURAL PROJECTS FUND
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Chad for the equivalent of US$12.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Rural Projects Fund. FAC,
the French aid agency would participate in the financing of the project with
a grant of about US$1.0 million equivalent.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Background
2.        A report entitled "Chad's Economic Development:   Constraints and
Potential" (75a-CD) was distributed to the Executive Directors in July 1973.
An economic mission visited Chad in April 1976 to review recent developments
and to assess medium-term development prospects. Its preliminary conclusions
are reflected in the following paragraphs. Annex I contains Country Data.
3.        With scarce natural resources, a harsh climate, limited social
and economic infrastructure and a pervasive lack of skilled manpower, Chad
faces unusually large handicaps in its economic development. High cost
of transportation to and from the outside world compounds the problem:
the main centers of activity of this vast landlocked country are about 2,000
km from the sea; freight rates from the port of Douala in Cameroon to Southern
Chad were about US$130/ton for bulk goods and US$180/ton for general goods
in early 1976.
4.        With a 1975 per capita GNP of US$120 Chad is one of the poorest
countries in Africa and is classified as one of the world's 25 "least developed"
countries by the United Nations. Close to 90 percent of the population, es-
timated at about 4 million, lives in rural areas deriving their livelihood
from agriculture and livestock. About half the rural population lives in the
south-west or cotton zone, where average rainfall is about 1,000 mm/year and
grows millet and sorghum as food crops and cotton as a cash crop. The other
half are mainly pastoralists living in the dry grassland belt, with lower and
less reliable rainfall. Recently, efforts have been made to intensify tradi-
tional rice growing on the flood plains of the Logone River.
5.        During the 1960s, real GDF increased about 2 percent annually.
The highest growth rates were achieved in the market economy (mainly import
substitution industries and services), while the growth of livestock and
subsistence crops probably did not reach that of population, estimated at

- 2 -
about 2 percent per year. Income disparities were relatively wide and appear
to have widened between the small urban sector and the rural areas and, within
the rural population, between producers of cash crops and the rest.
Recent Developments
6.        Three events have affected economic growth and the financial sit-
uation since the late 1960s: the internal security problems, the drought
and the deterioration in the terms of trade. The rebellion that broke
out in 1968 made large areas insecure and cut traditional cattle routes.
Due to lack of security and maintenance funds, wells were neglected and
the water supply for livestock dwindled. Animal disease control suffered
a setback. The impact of the internal security problems was compounded by
severe droughts, which occurred in three of the five years, 1969-1973. Water
levels in the rivers reached an all-time low, and Lake Chad shrunk to one-
third of its normal size. Livestock losses were substantial, notably in
cattle and sheep. Food crops were also hard hit; production of millet and
sorghum fell to about 70 percent of pre-drought levels in 1972 and to about
60 percent in 1973. Emergency food shipments from abroad helped the hard
hit areas. With the return of normal rainfall, food production recovered to
pre-drought levels in 1974/75.
7.        Cotton production picked up considerably in 1974 and reached a
record volume in 1975 (175,000 tons); this was accompanied by a proportional
increase in the number of draft oxen used. The upturn in crop production
stimulated industry, transportation and trade. On the other hand, livestock
offtake, after surging in the drought years because of emergency slaughtering,
has substantially decreased, reflecting the reduction of the herd and the
beginning of its reconstitution. Moreover, the economy now feels the full
impact of the accelerated import price inflation in 1974-1975 and the concurrent
decline in export prices. Chad's terms of trade worsened by about Il percent
between 1972 and 1975 and are likely to deteriorate further in the years
ahead.
8.        Up to 1968, the budget was in balance and, in view of the country's
development constraints, fiscal performance could be considered satisfactory.
After 1968, however, expenditures began to grow much more rapidly than revenue
as military spending increased substantially (security and defense now account
for about one-third of the current budget.) The drought also increased de-
mand for Government services while it reduced revenue. Further contributing
factors were the continuous and recently accelerated inflation of import
prices and the rise in Government employment -- a means of containing unem-
ployment especially among school leavers. As a result, the overall budget
deficit (excluding capital expenditures financed by foreign aid) rose from
CFAF 2.0 billion (15.5 percent of revenue) in 1970 to CFAF 4.1 billion (30.5
percent of revenue) in 1974, but dropped to CFAF 2.1 billion (13.5 percent of
revenue) in 1975 due to special efforts to collect tax arrears and some reduc-
tion in spending. External budget subsidies partly covered these deficits. A
considerable gap remained, however, resulting in payments arrears accumulat-
ing to CFAF 11.6 billion (US$51 million) by the end of March 1976, of which



- 3 -
about 80 percent was due domestic suppliers and 20 percent due foreign
creditors.
9.        The continuous rise in budgetary expenditures has been exclusively
in recurrent expenditures; Government-financed investment -- about CFAF
1 billion until 1972 - has shrunk to virtually zero. The rise in current
spending would have been still much larger but for the progressive curtailment
of material supplies required for the operation and maintenance of Government
services. This has been particularly marked in economic services. In 1974,
for example, road maintenance expenditures were less than 1 percent of total
expenditures, and of the allocation for the Department of Agriculture and
Livestock (less than 5 percent of the budget total) all but 12 percent was for
wages and salaries. Because of the lack of essential material implements,
from stationery to spare parts, most Government services cannot function
effectively.
External Aid
10.       Since 1973, aid flows have been massive, grants alone about equalling
tax revenue in 1973 and 1975, and exceeding it by 24 percent in 1974. Total
disbursements of external aid in 1973-1975 were US$222 million, three-quarters
of which were grants.  Aid from OPEC countries rose from zero in 1972 to 10
percent of the total aid in 1973 and 18 percent in 1975 (US$15 million).
Nearly two-thirds of official aid disbursements came from bilateral donors
(France, 52 percent; USA, 5 percent; Germany, 4 percent; Canada, 3 percent),
the remainder from multilateral sources (FED, 26 percent; UN organizations,
6 percent; IDA, 3 percent.) External aid financed practically all public
investments.
11.       The massive inflow of foreign aid almost offset the large deficits
in the goods and services account of Chad's balance of payments, so that its
position in the Operations Account with the Bank of Central African States
(BEAC) changed only insignificantly. At the end of March 1976, the foreign
exchange position on the Operations Account which reflects the largest part
of net foreign reserves was minus CFAF 1.3 billion.
i2.       Since most foreign aid has so far consisted of grants, public exter-
nal debt is still relatively small, totalling US$163 million at the beginning
of 1976, of which US$70 million were disbursed. Disbursed IDA credits repre-
sented 16 percent of this amount. Debt service was estimated at US$6.3
million or 5 percent of export earnings in 1975. For 1976 projected debt
service, on existing debt will be US$9.4 million or 7 percent of export of
goods and non factor services; the debt service payments will peak at US$11.1
million or 6.6 percent of export of goods and non factor services in 1978 to
decline to its pre-1976 levels after 1980. While this would be manageable
in relatior to projected export earnings, the bulk of service payments would
have to come from Government revenues. At present Chad has already accumu-
lated payments arrears in external debt service of about US$10 million. To
cope with this problem Chad earlier this year set up a "Caisse Autonome
d'Amortissement," an agency in charge of public debt management whose
director reports directly to the Head of State.



Development Prospects
13.       Chad's development potential lies primarily in agriculture.
Opportunities for productive employment in the urban areas will remain
small. But progress in the rural economy, even assuming political stabil-
ity and normal rainfall, will be slow. Recently, the Government announced
the discovery of oil in the north-western and southern parts of the coun-
try. However, it will take time to assess the size of the deposits and
the feasibility of their exploitation.
14.       The fiscal situation is a serious obstacle to development, since
the Government cannot contribute to the financing of required investments
nor finance all recurrent costs of ongoing and new high-priority projects.
The military government which took power in April 1975 is aware of the need
to re-examine current spending priorities. The narrow tax base and the
rising cost of maintaining even the present level of public services make
it unlikely, however, that budgetary savings can be generated during the
rest of the 1970s. In view of this constraint, Chad's poverty and its
modest growth prospects, external funds should be provided on the most
concessionary terms possible. Moreover, in the next few years foreign
aid agencies should consider financing a high proportion of total project
costs, including whenever feasible some recurrent costs.
PART Il - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CHAD
15.       Past and future Bank Group lending to Chad focus on agriculture
(including livestock) and transportation, as well as on the development of
the country's human resources.   To date the Bank Group has extended nine
credits to Chad totalling US$37.2 million. 1/ Five of these credits were
for agriculture (including livestock), two for highway maintenance and im-
provement, and two for education. Five of the eight projects are either
completed or near completion; the others are progressing satisfactorily.
Delays have occurred in project implementation mainly due to lack of coun-
terpart funds but also because of design problems and late signing of con-
sultants contracts. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits
as of October 31, 1976, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
16.       In agriculture our main objectives are to help the Government
assure a sufficient food supply for a growing urban as well as the predo-
minantly rural population and to protect Chad's production base against
the vagaries of climate. In rainfed agriculture, past IDA lending has
been designed to raise rural productivity mainly through the provision of
infrastructure, equipment and storage facilities while in the Sahelian zone
1/   Includes supplementary financing of US$0.9 million approved in August
1973 for the two education projects; and US$8.0 million supplementary
credit approved in August 1976 for the Sategui-Deressia irrigation
project (not effective).

IDA is contributing to the expansion of the livestock lndustry through the
rehabilitation and construction of pastoral wells. In Irrigation IDA is
assisting in the financing of the Sategui-Deressia and Lake Chad Polders
projects which will produce rice, wheat and seed cotton. The proposed proj-
ect would continue our efforts In these areas.
17.       In transportation, we give priority to road maintenance and to
improvement of feeder roads and agricultural export routes. The road com-
ponent of the proposed project, like our Second Highway Project of 1974, ls
designed to improve feeder roads; a possible third highway project, to be
appraised this fiscal year, would serve to improve and maintain the cotton
export routes. We are also considering projects in Chad which will improve
lts transport llnks with the sea, although much of the lmprovement wlll come
from transport investments In the coastal countries.
18.       Two education projects financed by IDA in 1968 and 1971 assisted
the Government In training teachers, agriculturalists and technicians - the
most needed skills in the economy. In cooperation with two U.N. agencies,
we are currently preparing a third project to improve mainly primary educa-
tion facilities in rural areas. Chad's severe fLnancial. and man-power con-
straints limit education lnvestment opportunitles and necessitate special
arrangements for counterpart funds, technical assistance and recurrent
costs.
PART III - THE RIJRAL SECTOR
19.       The rural sector contributes about 55 percent to GDP and about
90 percent to exports, of which cotton, livestock and animal products, and
fish are the main commodities. Chad is normally self-suffLcient in coarse
grains but imports of 30,000 tons/year were necessary during the 1972-1974
drought. The only agricultural products imported Ln any volume in "normal"
years are wheat and sugar.
Production
20.       Rainfed crop production, which ls concentrated In the south and
which becomes more precarious towards the north of the country, is based
on famlly farms cultivating 2-3 ha. While subsistence food crops such
as millet, sorghum, and legumes are given first priority by farmers at plant-
lng time, there is a continuing expansion of cash crop production, predomi-
nantly cotton. Cotton production has lncreased from about 100,000 tons/
year in the mid-1960s through 1973/1974 to the record 175,000 tons in
1975/1976, mainly as a result of the productivity program financed with
FAC and FED assistance. The program provides effective extension and
input distribution services and, in 1975, reached over 40 percent of all
cotton farms. On these, yields were more than twice those obtained with-
out improved inputs. Chad is now the leading cotton exporter in West
Africa.



- 6 -
21.       Irrigated crop production is relatively insignificant though the
potentially irrigable area is great. About 50,000 ha of paddy and wheat
are grown on land subject to uncontrolled flooding; only about 1,000 ha
have been equipped for controlled irrigation. Current paddy production
is about 40,000 tons/year and wheat production is about 7,000 tons/year;
in sum, this represents only about 7 percent of rainfed foodgrain produc-
tion in a normal year. Pilot irrigation schemes are being promoted by
Government, with IDA and other foreign assistance. The Sategui-Deressia
Project (Credit 489-CD) and the Lake Chad Polders Project (Credit 592-CD)
will increase the area equipped for irrigation by about 6,000 ha, and pro-
duction of paddy and wheat would thereby increase by about 15,000 tons/year.
22.       Livestock becomes the mainstay of the rural economy towards the
central Sahelian zone where milk is a major item of the subsistence diet.
Prior to the drought, the national herd consisted of about 4.5 million
cattle, 5 million sheep and goats, and over 1 million transport animals.
It is estimated that the 1973 drought has caused severe losses of about
30 percent in cattle and 20 percent in sheep. A livestock census under
FED auspices has just been completed and will provide a clearer picture
of this subsector. Biological limits to herd reconstitution imply that
pre-drought production levels of meat and milk wi.1l not be reached until
at least the mid-1980s.
Price Policy
23.       Almost all prices in Chad are determined by demand and supply
despite Government's attempts to intervene. When livestock prices began
to rise very sharply immediately after the drought, Government fixed max-
imum producer prices. In practice, however, livestock producer prices con-
tinue to be determined by markets in north-eastern Nigeria, which are the
main outlets for slaughterstock. Government is aware that its official
price policy is unrealistic and is reviewing it. Maximum producer prices
for the main crops announced in mid-1975 have been similarly ineffective.
The only producer price which Government can and dces control is cotton.
The only major subsidy program is for fertilizer and insecticide and asso-
ciated distribution costs for cotton. Because of export taxes and the oper-
ation of the price stabilization fund, however, the net effect in most years
is a transfer from producers to the public sector. The net incentive to
producers is nonetheless attractive.
Institutions
24.       The Ministry of Agricultural and Pastoral Development is responsible
for the agricultural sector. Ministries generally lack budgetary resources
and trained manpower. In contrast, there are numerous specialized and rela-
tively autonomous government agencies which usually have benefitted from
foreign technical and financial assistance and are better staffed than the
ministries. Their performance has, however, been mixed.



-7-
Rural Sector Strategy
25.       Rainfed crops have the best development prospects in the agricultural
sector; most of the present production comes from dryland farming and there is
much unexploited potential. Government's objectives for many years have been
to promote cotton and, to a much smaller extent, groundnuts. Since much of
the dryland farming area is drought-prone, however, Government is rtghtly
anxious to protect the country against food shortages ln future drought years.
The irrigation potential in Chad is probably in excess of 200,000 ha, and
Government wishes to make fuller use of it, ln order to diversify crop produc-
tion, to provide some insurance against drought and partly, too, to start
developing a high technology agriculture. While investing In two medLum size
schemes, Government is also keen to promote smaller, simpler schemes in which
the beneficiaries could more readily participate. In the livestock sector,
Government's traditional emphasis has been on animal health services and stock
watering, and marketing facilities for increased herd build-up and higher
offtake rates. This policy is now fully justified; after the drought, the
reconstitution of the herd is the lmmediate task. Large and sustainable
increases in output, however, can only be achieved by grazing control and
improved husbandry. At the same time, Government recognizes the potential
of livestock ln association with crops in the south, and tntends to promote
further the introduction of work oxen into smallholdings.
26.       The limited capacity of the planning and executing agencies hin-
ders the implementation of Government's generally sound policies for the
rural sector. Moreover, plans to provide better public services to the
rural sector will continue to be largely frustrated by meager revenues.
Some improvement can nonetheless be achieved by increased efforts to ob-
tain payment from direct beneficiaries of these limited services, partic-
ularly village and pastoral wells. Government recognizes the difficulty
of recoverirg costs for services that have been provided free in the past
(i.e. village water supply), even if only to a limited number of people,
but is now determined to achieve a far greater degree of cost recovery
from beneficiaries for specific servlces rendered.
27.       With lts numerous worthwhile lnvestment components in rainfed
agriculture, in the livestock sector, in small-scale irrigation and rural
services the proposed project fits well in the rural sector strategy. The
Fund Management Unit and the internationally recruited key staff would
strengthen Government's ability to implement the relatively simple and
easily-replicated project components and to prepare new small rural proj-
ects. Thereby it could become a catalyst for a more effective flow of
funds into the rural sector.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
28.       The Government of Chad has requested IDA assistance to set up
a Rural Projects Fund which would finance seven small-scale rural sub-
projects. The project was identified by RMWA ln late 1974. An IDA mission
appraised the project in November/December 1975. A report entitled "Appraisal
of a Rural Projects Fund - Chad" No. 1194-CD dated October 27, 1976 ls being
distributed separately and a Credit and Project Summary ls attached to this
report as Annex III. Negotiations for the proposed credit were held in
Washington from August 4 to August 9, 1976 with a Chadian delegation led by
Mr. Kerim Togol, Minister of Economy, Planning and Transport.
Project Description
29.       The Rural Projects Fund (RPF) is intended as the first three-year
phase of a longer term program, and would lnclude finance for the preparation
of a second-phase project. The RPF would comprise:
(a) the development and initial operation of 42 small-scale
pump irrigation perimeters (about 970 ha irrLgated) and
five service centers along the northern Chari River;
(b) the construction of 200 warehouses Ln the Cotton Zone;
(c) the rehabilitation of a pastoral wells network (about 300
lined wells) in the Batha prefecture In the Sahelian zone;
(d) the establishment and initial operation of a tubewell
drilling and open well maintenance unit to serve villages
Ln three prefectures ln the Cotton Zone, including the
rehabilitation of about 146 lined wells and the installa-
tion of about 110 tubewells to be operated by foot pumps;
(e) minor structural repairs and spot resurfacing spread over
about 1,200 km of feeder roads in the Cotton Zone;
(f) buildLngs and equipment for animal feed production and
poultry marketing near NDjamena;
(g) land improvements and water control works in bottomlands
(about 700 ha) in the Cotton Zone.
In addit[on, the project would finance a Fund Management Unit (FMU), technical
assistance, trainlng seminars and consultants' services.



-9-
Project Implementation
30.       Government would create FMU in the Ministry of Economy, Planning and
Transport (Section 3.02(a) of the draft Development Credit Agreement), consist-
ing of a Chadian Fund Manager, an internationally recruited Deputy Fund Manager
and supporting staff. The Fund Manager would report to an Interministerial
Governing Committee consisting of the Director Generals of the five relevant
ministries and the Director of Planning as Secretary (Section 3.03 of the
draft Development Credit Agreement). FMU would review detailed subproject
work programs, budgets and progress reports, bidding procedures and contracts.
It would monitor and evaluate all project-financed activities and would
identify and prepare a follow-up project.
31.       Subproject implementation would be undertaken by the national
rural development board (ONDR) for the small-scale irrigation and warehouses
subprojects; the rural water supply agency (SERARHY) for the pastoral wells
and village water supply subprojects; the Chad cotton company (COTONTCHAD)
for the feeder road subproject; the livestock production improvement center
(CMPA) for the animal feed/poultry marketing subproject; and the rural engi-
neering department (Genie Rural) and ONDR for the bottomland development
subproject. COTONTCHAD and these agencies are among the best organized and
staffed in the country. The ONDR, SERARHY and Genie Rural dlvisions which
are directly responsible for subproject implementation would nonetheless need
to be strengthened by technical assistance and additional local staff financed
under the proposed project.
Cost Estimates and Financial Arrangements
32.       Project costs for the three-year period beginning October 1976 are
estimated at US$13.4 million (net of taxes), with a foreign exchange component
of 55 percent. Project costs would include a physical contingency of 9 per-
cent of base cost (US$1.0 million) and provision for expected price increases
of 21 percent of base cost (US$2.2 million).
33.       It is proposed that an IDA credit of US$12.0 million be made to
the Government covering 90 percent of project costs. FAC would contribute
almost US$1.0 million, or 7 percent of project costs. The FAC contribution
would be made available pari passu with the proceeds of the proposed credit
and would finance 20 percent of the cost of two subprojects: small-scale
irrigation and bottomland development, as well as for the FMU. The remaining
project costs estimated at US$0.4 million or about 3 percent of project costs
would be contributed by final beneficiaries as onfarm inputs and equipment in
the case of the small-scale irrigation subproject and in cash corresponding
to 10 percent of tubewell installation costs in the case of the village water
supply subproject. Farmers in the small-scale irrigation and bottomland
development subprojects would also contribute unpaid voluntary labor valued
at about US$0.6 million, which is not included in the project cost estimates.
The IDA credit would be channelled through an account to be opened in the
name of the FMU at the BDT. FMU would allocate these funds as grants to the
agencies charged with sub-project implementation. Since Chad is unable to
prefinance project expenditures, IDA would provide a revolving fund, through
the FMU account at BDT, of US$0.5 million from the credit account. IDA

extended a US$0.5 million project preparation advance to Government on
October 11, 1976 to help complete project preparation. Recurrent costs of
the small scale irrigation and village water supply subprojects would be
recovered from beneficiaries; in the case of pastoral wells the Government
would prepare detailed proposals for cost-recovery once ongoing studies are
completed. Even if the beneficiaries fail to bear the recurrent costs the
Government cash flow would be positive from the third project year onwards.
Procurement and Disbursements
34.       Procurement of vehicles and equipment (estimated cost US$1.8 mil-
lion), building construction (estimated cost US$2.2 million), and materials
for force account works (estimated cost US$1.6 million), would be through
international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines in the
case of contracts over US$50,000; for building construction contracts, local
contractors would receive 7 1/2 percent preference. In the case of contracts
of less than US$50,000 but more than US$10,000, procurement would be through
competitive bidding in accordance with local procedures acceptable to IDA.
For contracts under US$10,000, direct purchasing would be employed. The
services of expatriate staff and consultants (estimated cost US$1.6 million)
would be obtained following procedures acceptable to IDA.
35.       The proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed to finance 80
percent of the cost of all items in those subprojects with FAC co-financing,
except for on-farm investments in the small-scale irrigation subproject, and
100 percent of the cost of all items in the other subprojects except for oper-
ating costs of village water supplies where disbursement would be made to
finance 40 percent of costs. Disbursements would cover vehicles and equip-
ment (US$1.8 million), buildings construction materials and skilled labor
(US$4.0 million), expatriate staff and consultants (US$1.4 million), local
staff salaries (US$0.9 million), operating costs (US$0.9 million), operating
costs of the village water supplies subproject (US$0.1 million), and work-
ing capital for the first year of each new small-scale irrigation perimeter
(US$0.2 million), all net of identifiable taxes. Up to US$0.5 million would
be used for refinancing the project preparation advance granted by IDA and
US$2.2 million would be unallocated. Except for the revolving fund, for which
certification of expenditures would be made available after withdrawal from
the Credit, disbursements would be made against import documentation, con-
tracts and certified records of expenditures. Any remaining undisbursed
funds would be made available for new subprojects to be identified and pre-
pared by FMU and to be approved by IDA.
Economic Benefits, Justification and Risks
36.       The major economic benefits of the proposed project would include:
cotton, wheat and sorghum production from small-scale irrigation; wet season
paddy production from bottomlands; increased meat and milk production from
pastoral wells; reduced losses of farm inputs arising from warehouses; the
re-opening of feeder roads and unit transport cost savings; and increased
throughput and unit cost savings in animal feed production and poultry mar-
keting. Cotton lint would be exported, wheat and paddy would substitute for
imports, and sorghum would help to meet the growing internal foodgrain de-
mand; incremental supplies of slaughter cattle would be exported mainly to



- il -
Nigeria, and sheep and goats would be consumed locally. Incremental milk
production would be used for subsistence. No marketing problems are antici-
pated.
37.       The project would also provide important social and institutional
benefits. For example, village wells would provide an assured and clean
water supply to people who would otherwise depend on small creeks that dry
up for several months per year and which may contain waterborne diseases;
and the local staff of the executing agencies would acquire on-the-job expe-
rience in the implementation of simple, easily-replicated rural works.
38.       The number of small farming or pastoral families likely to receive
increased incomes under the project would be about 47,000. An additional
26,000 families would benefit from improved village water supplies. In sum,
73,000 families or about 400,000 rural people of whom about half would be
Sahelian pastoralists, would receive direct tangible benefits from the proj-
ect. The per capita income levels of most project beneficiaries fall within
the range of US$55 to 65.
39.       The economic rate of return is estimated to be 11 percent for small-
scale irrigation, the base cost of which is US$2.5 million; 20 percent for
warehouses, the base cost of which is US$2.0 million; 19 percent for pastoral
wells, the base cost of which is US$1.1 million; 19 percent for feeder road
improvement, the base cost of which is US$1.2 million; and 14 percent for
bottomland development, the base cost of which is US$0.6 million. The over-
all rate of return of these subprojects, including the overhead cost of the
Fund Management Unit, which together account for 78 percent of total project
base cost, is 17 percent.   This aggregate rate of return excludes the village
water supplies and the animal feed and poultry marketing subprojects for which
no meaningful rate of return could be estimated because of the predominance of
non-quantifiable benefits.
40.       The success of four of the seven subprojects depends on key expa-
triates; particularly intensive efforts are therefore being made through APMU
to recruit good staff. Appointment of such staff would be a condition of dis-
bursement (Schedule I paragraph 3 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Further difficulties could arise from the impossibility of undertaking rural
works outside the dry season (November/May), but the risk of delay in initial
operations is being reduced by recourse to the project preparation facility.
Problems of collection of fees from direct beneficiaries can be anticipated
for the pastoral wells and village water supplies subprojects and, although
to a lesser extent, for the small-scale irrigation subproject, despite the
intended efforts of the Government. Assurances in respect of appropriate
fee collection arrangements are included in Sections 3.11 (a), 3.13 (b) and
3.15 of the draft Development Credit Agreement.    Since the RPF consists of
seven independent subprojects, the failure of one component would not have
serious repercussions on the others.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
41.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Chad
and the Association, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article V,
Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution
approving the proposed Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
42.       Features of the draft Development Credit Agreement of special
interest are referred to in paragraphs 30 and 40 of this Report. Additional
conditions of effectiveness provided for in Section 6.01 of the draft Devel-
opment Credit Agreement include creation of the Fund Manàgement Unit, the
Interministerial Governing Committee, the establishment of the Rural Projects
Fund account in BDT, the appointment of the Fund Manager, and assurances
satisfactory to the Association in respect of FAC financing. Appointment of
key staff for each of the irrigation, pastoral wells, village water supply
and bottomland development subprojects would be a condition of disbursement
for that particular subproject.
43.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
44.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 125     Highway Maintenance Project:   US$4.1 million Credit of
August 14, 1968; Effective Date: February 11, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The project consisted of (a) a 5-year program for highway mainten-
ance including technical assistance, the procurement of equipment and mate-
rials, repair shop extension, training of operators and mechanics , and
establishment of traffic data collection system; and (b) feasibility studies,
and if found justified, detailed engineering for the Djermaya-Djimtilo road.
The project was completed on December 3", 1973 but two of its
components were not implemented: the training program was dropped at the
Government's request because the cost of the consultants' proposals ex-
ceeded the amount available under the credit. However, a comprehensive
training program is included in the second highway project. The feasi-
bility study for improvement of the Djermaya-Djimtilo road was completed;
however, detailed engineering found premature, has been deferred due to
low traffic volume.
Credit No. 126     Education Project: US$2.2 million Credit of August 29, 1968
(as amended); Effective Date: December 31, 1968; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976.
The Project consists of (a) the construction and equipping of a
teacher training college at Moundou and (b) the construction and equipping of
an agricultural technician training center at Ndjamena (transferred to Sarh
under Credit 251).
The teacher training college has been completed and put into opera-
tion and the credit fully disbursed in the first quarter of 1976 about two and
a half years behind schedule. Reasons for the delay have been (a) delay in
reaching agreement on each stage of design; (b) the need to revise the design
and negotiate with the lowest bidder because of cost overruns; and (c) the
need to amend the Credit Agreement to resolve the financial problems created
by the US dollar fluctuation and internal budgetary difficulties.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Credit No. 251     Second Education Project:   US$2.7 million Credit of
June 16, 1971; (as amended); Effective Date:
December 28, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The project consists of (a) the construction and equipping of a
secondary technical school at Ndjamena; (b) supply of complementary equipment
for the existing vocational training center at Ndjamena; (c) the transfer of
the agricultural technician training center, financed under Credit 126, from
Ndjamena to Sarh; and (d) a study of young farmers' training schemes.
The project is almost totally completed about 12 months behînd
schedule due to (a) delay in reaching agreement on the educational and
architectural programs for the technical secondary school; (b) delay in
preparation of equipment lists; and (c) the need to amend the Credit Agree-
ment to resolve the financial problems created by the fluctuation of the
US dollar and internal budgetary difficulties, Lack of government funds for
recurrent costs may create operating problems.
Credit No. 309     Livestock Development Project: US$2.2 million Credit of
May 31, 1972; Effective Date: November 28, 1972; Closing
Date: June 30, 1977.
The project now comprises: (a) the construction of 18 new pastoral
wells and the repair and rehabilitation of 18 existing wells in the Batha
prefecture; (b) the establishment of two well maintenance units, including
their operating costs for the first two years; and (c) special studies carried
out by a Livestock Development Unit (LDU) established with UNDP assistance.
Although the credit became effective in November 1972, project
lmplementation was begun only following the Board's decision to finance 100
percent of project costs, net of duties and taxes, and to establish a revolv-
ing account, which became effective in March 1974. Well construction and
repairs are progressing satisfactorily and completion is expected by end 1976.
Well maintenance units are in operation. Studies on water extraction and
livestock taxation are being carried out by consultants. UNDP did not extend
its assistance to LDU, due to unsatisfactory results and this unit Ls now
lntegrated in the Livestock Services.
Credit No. 445     Drought Relief Fund Project: US$2.0 million Credit of
December 7, 1973; Effective Date; March 22, 1974; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976.
The project is designed to help people in areas affected by the
drought to re-establish their productive base; it comprises the following
eight subprojects: equipment, workshops, technical assistance and operating
costs for underground water development; equipment and operating costs for
"Genie Rural", "Water Survey Bureau", and "Land Development Department"
equipment, buildings and operating costs for the Livestock Service; con-
struction of warehouses; equipment and operating costs for a vegetable
growing pilot scheme; and equipment and operating costs for the Planning
Department.

Physical execution of the project is sattsfactory, with all of the
15 sub-projects completed or nearly completed.
Credit No. 489      Sategul-Deressia Irrigation Project: US$7.5 million
Credit of June 28, 1974; (as amended); Effective Date
January 27, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
The project covers the development of 11,000 ha in the Sategui-
Deressia plain under controlled flooding for rice production. It includes
(a) the construction of an intake on the right bank of the Logone River to
provide water for the whole irrigated area, protection dykes against high
floods, main canals and drains, feeder roads, buildings, a rice mill and
storage facilities, (b) strengthening of the project authority with manage-
ment staff, facilities and equipment and (c) agricultural research and in
service training.
BIds for civil works were called in August 1974 and June 1975 with
unsatlsfactory results. Failure to obtaln acceptable bids led the Government
to reformulate the project, adopting force account construction using a mix
of local labor and machines, and starting implementation with a 300 ha polder.
(Board Approval of Amendment to the Credit Agreement - IDA/R75-89, September
1975.) The 4 km long main intake canal and a 300 ha polder thus constructed
are now completed. The entire project has been reappraised and in view of
favourable results IDA has accorded a supplementary credlt of US$8.0
million on August 10, 1976.
Credit No. 490      Second Ylighway Project: US$3.5 million Credit of June 28,
1974; Effective Date: March 7, 1975; Closing Date: June 30,
1980.
The project comprises (a) a five-year program for improvement and
maintenance of feeder roads in cotton growing areas; (b) pre-investment
studies for about 120 km of cotton export routes; (c) a two-year traln£ng
program for DPW staff; (d) technical assistance for the reorganization of
the road transport industry; (e) a two-year traffic count on about 2,000 km of
the most important roads; (f) reconditioning of ferry boats and their interim
maintenance over a three-year period; and (g) feasibility study for replace-
ment of ferry boats and improvement of dock facilities.
Project implementation is about ten months behind schedule. However,
consultant contracts for the training program, pre-investment studies, and
implementation of the feeder road maintenance program are now effective.
Because of higher than anticipated rate of inflation, the delay in project
implementation, and the Lncreased requtrement for construction materials, a
cost overrun is expected. This will reduce the maintenance program financed
under the project.

Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
The project comprises rehabilitation or construction of irriga-
tion and drainage networks of two polders of about 1,200 ha., to permit
cotton and wheat cultivation.
Project implementation is progressing satisfactorily.

US$1.8 million), building construction (estimated cost
US$2.2 million), and materials for force account works
(estimated cost US$1.6 million), would be through inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with IDA
guidelines in the case of contracts over US$50,000; for
building construction contracts, local contractors would
receive 7-1/2 percent preference. In the case of con-
tracts of less than US$50,000 but more than US$10,000,
procurement would be through competitive bidding in
accordance with local procedures acceptable to IDA. For
contracts under US$10,000, direct purchasing would be
employed. The services of expatriate staff and consul-
tants (estimated cost US$1.6 million) would be obtained
following procedures acceptable to IDA.
