(CREDIT 664-CD/664-1-CD)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Rural Projects
Fund Project in Chad, for which Credit 664-CD in the amount of US$12.0 million
was approved on November 30, 1976. Because of civil war disturbances, the credit
was revised in May 1985. The credit was closed on June 30, 1988. It was fully
disbursed and the last disbursement was on April 18, 1988.
The PCR was prepared by the Agriculture Operations Division, Sahelian
Department of the Africa Region (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III).
Parts I and III were sent to the Borrower for comments to be incorForated in
Part II, but none was received.
This PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Credit
Agreement; supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower;
and internal Bank memoranda.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
1.        The Rural Projects Fund (RPF) was the first three-year phase of a
long-term program for financing small-scale rural projects. The project was
to benefit some 73,000 farm families as follows:   small-scale irrigation
(3,900 families); bottomland development (3,500 families); pastoral wells
(40,000 families); and village water supplies (25,000 families). It was also
intended to strengthen the different executing agencies, and indirectly
benefit many other rural families. Moreover, it aimed at strengthening the
planning and managerial capacity of the Ministry of Finance, Economy and
Planning in the field of rural development.
Implementation Experience
2.        After delays in effectiveness and start-up mainly because of the
time necessary for recruiting technical advisers and procuring equipment,
the project made some satisfactory progress initially. In mid-1979, however,
project execution was interrupted by civil war. The project was suspended
until 1985, the Credit Agreement was amended in May 1985, and the closing
date extended to June 30, 1988. The revised project eliminated three
subprojects and scaled down the workprogram for the subproject involving
small-scale irrigation perimeters.
Results
3.        Physical targets were substantially revised after the war. Given
the 1984 revised objectives, at the closing dates (i) under small-scale
irrigation, pump maintenance was financed entirely by farmers and water
charge collections from farmers attained 862, and four perimeters (out of
ten) for a total of 40 ha were cultivated with millet and sorghum with
supplementary irrigation; (ii) under village stores, 80 stores (as planned)
were officially accepted; under feeder roads, 2,300 km had been regraded (out
of 2,500 km) and the Feeder Roads Brigade Management transferred to
Cotontchad; (iv) under water suPply, 57 water points completed (out of 110),
and 110 handpumps had been received and officially accepted.

Sustainability
4.        The major indirect benefit of the Project was the on-the-job
experience acquired by local staff and institutions in the construction of
simple, easily replicated rural works such as village stores, feeder roads
or water supplies. However, the rather top-down approach for designing and
implementing smail-scale irrigation perimeters was inappropriate and failed
in term of sustainability. Moreover, the planning an-d managerial capacity of
the Fund Management Unit (as well as the Ministry of Agriculture) needs
further strengthening in the field of rural development.
Findings and Lessons Learned
5.        The main lessons learned ares
(f)     involvement of Goversament is crucial even if by a minor
financial contributiong
(ii)     development   of   irrigation   perimeters   needs   a
participatory approach with the farming coumunity;
(iii)     staff training in planning,  budgeting and technical
matters is absolutely crucial, specially in Chad where
available experienced staff is very limited;
(iv)     advance  preparation  and  procurement  action  would
accelerate implementation of progrsmu and thus would
save on salaries and operating costs of the implementing
agencies.

- Sector:           Agriculture
B.   Project Background
1.01      The Rural Projects Fund project was the Bank's fifti' agricultural
project in Chad. Three successive years of drought in the early 1970s
prompted Government and donor efforts to identify ways of reducing Chad's
vulnerability to climatic forces. Previous IDA credits for agriculture were
as follovss (i) the Livestock Develop_at Project (Credit 309-CD); (ii) the
Drought Relief Fund (Credit 445-CD); (iii) the Sategui-Deressia Irrigation
Project (489-CD); (iv) the Lake Chad Polders Project (Credit 592-CD). Over
the subsequent fifteen years, the Bank agreed to finance five other projects
in the agricultural sector with IDA credits totalling about USS69 million.
However, all Bank operations in Chad were suspended from 1979-83 because of
the civil war; of the five projects on the books in 1979, only the Sategui-
Deressia and Rural Projects Fund projects ware completed. Three projects
supported by IDA funds have been initiated since 1985: Emergency Cotton
(Credit 1716-CD), Agricultural Rehabilitation (Credit 1775-CD). and National
Livestock (Credit 1912-CD).
1.02      Sector Development Object'ves (at tise of project appraisal). In
support of the Government's central goal of promoting rural development and
food security through a major production and export effort, the iinuediate
objectives inL the rural sector were to increase crop and livestock production
for conscption and export, and to safeguard against food shortages in future
drought years.
1.03      Policy Context
(a)  Rainfed crops  Because of severe past droughts, the Government
was anxious to safeguard against food shortages by (i) promoting short-cycle
drought-resistant varieties and improved cultural practices in the Sahelian
zone, and (ii) improving foodcrop productivity in the cotton zone. The latter



measure was intended to secure food supply and to free up more resources for
cash crops in an appropriate rotation system.
%b) Government wished to make better use of irrigation potential
in order to diversify crop production and provide some insurance against
drought. Large irrigation projects, even when economically justified in
specific cases, were considered difficult to implement and costly per
beneficiary family. Lower-cost construction, involving much force account
labor, was initiated at Sategui-Deressia. Moreover, Government recomanded
smaller, simpler schemes which vould allow fanmers to participate in
construction and would not require sophisticated management.
(c) In the livestock sector, Government's emphasis was on animal
health services and stock watering, and on marketing facilities for increased
herd build-up and higher offtake rates. Pastoral associations were promoted
for better grazing control and improved husbandry.
(d)  Because Government's desire to provide better public services
to the rural sector was frustrated by meager revenues, increased efforts were
made towards cost recovery from beneficiaries for specific services rendered,
particularly village and pastoral wells.
C.   Initial Prolect Descrigtion
-     (a)  Obiectives
1.04      The Rural Projectao Fund (RPF) was the first three-year phase of a
long term program for financing s mll-scale rural projects. The project was
to benefit some 73,000 farm familles as follows small-scale irrigation
(3,900 families)t bottozland development (3,500 families): pastoral wells
(40,000 families): and village water supplies (25,000 families). It was also
intended to streangthen the different executing agencies and indirectly
benefit many other rural familise. Moreover, it aimed at strengthening the
planning and managerial capacity of the Ministry of Finance, Economy and
Planning in the field of rural development.
(b) Comvonents
1.05      As agreed at negotiations,  the  initial project  included the
following components:
(1)     the developmnt and initial operation of 42 small-scals
pump irrigation perimters (about 970 ha irrigated) and
five service centers alcug the northern Chari River:
(ii)     the construction of 200 warehouses in the cotton zone;
(iii)     the rehabilitation of a pastoral wells network (over 300
lined wells) in the Batha prefecture in the Sahelian
zone;



-3-
(Lv)     the establisbuont and initial operation of a tubov l
drilling and open well maintenance unit to serve villages
in the three prefectures in the cotton zone, including
the rehabilitation of about 14b lined wells and the
installation of about 110 tubewells to be operated by
foot pumps;
(v)     minor structural repairs and spot resurfacing spread over
about 1,200 km of feeder roads in the cotton zonel
(vi)     buildings and equipment for animal feed production and
poultry marketing near N'Djaaena;
(vii)     land improveoents and tater control works in bottomlands
(about 700 ha) in the cotton zone.
In  addition,  the  project  financed  a Fund Management  Unit  (m1(U),
technical assistance, training seminars and consultants' services.
D.   Revised Protect Description
1.06      Due to circumstances not anticipated at the time of appraisal and
design, pro lect execution was interrupted in mid-1979. Given the prevailing
conditions La Chad. the project was reformulated in October 1984. Compared
to the initial project, the reformulated project was scaled down to the
following four subprojects: (a) small-scale irrigationg (b) village
warehouses; (c) village water supplies; and (d) feeder road improvemet.
1.07      The  Fund  Management  Unit  (FMM   continued  to  coordinate  the
subprojects. The total cost of the refomalated project was estimated at
US$7.5 million equivalent, which represented the outstanding balance.
E.   Project Design and organization
1.08      Based on information available to the preparation and appraisal
missions of April 1975 and November/December 1975, the conceptual foundation
for the project was clear and appropriate. It aimed ats
(a) reaching a large number of rural people;
(b)  involving the beneficiaries in project impleentation;
(c)  requiring .nnniS managmnt and operating costs; and
(d) rapid implementation.
The purpose of this type of Fund was to give the project a flexbilLity
which was particularly important in Chad given the poor internal
commications,  severe  political  unrest  and  unwieldy  administrative
procedures that made project execution difficult.
1.09      Chadian  participation  in  project  preparation  was,  however.
negligible. The Government perceived the project more as a shopping list of
small projects to finance than as the creation of a national capacity for



4 
implementing, managing and moaitoring relativeLy small rural operations.
Moreover, beneficiaries were not involved in the des'p of the smAlI-scale
irrigation perimeters aLong the Chazi river. Farmers in these areas were more
geared to rainfed crops or livestock, and the introduction of completely new
and relatively sophisticated irrigation techniques would have required more
assistance from well-trained extension agents, as well as a participatory
diagnosis of existing farming systems to understand farmers, thinking on
drought risk and food security and, as a function of th8t, to determine the
relative weight to be given to irrigated versus rainfed crops. In addit.on,
food aid was used to induce farmers to work on developing irrigation
perimeters. This should be considered as a payment in kind rather than as the
intended beneficiary participation.
1.10      The  orRanization  of the  project was  dlvided  between  a Fund
Management Unit (PMU) in the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Transport,
and several technical agencies. The FMIJ consisted of a Chadian Fund Manager,
an internationally recruited Deputy Fund Manager, and support staff. The Fund
Manager had to report to an Interministerial Governing Committee consisting
of the ministers or their repree -tatives of the five relevant ministries and
the Director of Planning as Secretary. Several agencies had technical
responsibility for the implementation of the subprojects, namely ONDR for the
small-scale irrigation and warehouses subprojects; SERAREY for the pastoral
weLls and village water supply subprojects; COTONTCRAD for the feoder roads
subproject; CHPA for the animal feedlpoultry marketing subprojects; and GUne
Rural for the bottomland development subproject. Technical assistance was
supposed to strengthen ONDR, SERARBY and Gnaie  ural in the implemntation
of eich subproject.
1.11      This organizational  set-up was cumbersom   and  the management
ca,acity of the FMU overestimated. The project proved very difficult to
manage,  coordinate   and   monitor   because   technical   and   financial
responsibillties were split amogst different agencies reporting to different
ministries. Although implementation activities were delegated to existing
Government services, the project remained a top-down "execution project that
existed in parallel with in-line Goveranent sqrvices, without taking
advantage of the flexibility this situation was supposed to afford. A
monitoring and evaluatiou unit,could have provided regular information to be
used to reorient the subprojects and might have suggested basic elements to
be incorporated into a comprehenlve strategy for rural development in Chad.
F.. Project Implementation
1.12      Credit Effectiveness and Project Start-upt
Although Credit 664-CD was approved on November 30, 1976, signed on
December 8, 1976, and declared effective on March 2, 1977, project start-up
was slow. The time necessary for recruiting technical advisers and for
procuring equipment contributed to initial problems and delays. Once started,
the project had some initial success, which was short-lived because of the
civil war. The project was suspended in mid-1979, the Credit Agreement was
amended in Hay 198S, and the closing date extended to June 30, 1988.



The revised project eliminated three subprojects and scaled down the
work program for the subproject involving small-scale irrigation perimeters,
The Pastoral Wells subproject was dropped because many other donors (FAC,
EEC, UNICEF, Swiss Aid, and  Saudi Arabia) were involved or interested in
well construction in the project area. The subproject for Animal Feed
Production and Marketing of Poultry Products was dropped because under 1984
prevailing condit4ons it was not able to be financially self supporting. The
Bottomland Development subproject was dropped by lack of interest from
farmers.
Small-scale pump irrigation perimeters subproject
1.13      The choice of sites for small-scale irrigation perimeters was made
on the basis of soil survey by ORSTOM which showed fewer suitable sites than
had been forecast during appraisal, due to diificulties with soil fertility
or permeability in areas close to suitable water intake sites. This problem
caused the number of perimeters to be reduced from 42 to 20. After the war,
the revised project was scaled down by revising the objectives of the small-
scale irrigation perimeters subproject (10 small-scale irrigation perimeters
instead of 20). Still, in the remaining 10 irrigation perimeters, siol
fertility and permeability problems arose.
1.14      Moreover, contracts with groups of farmers for inputs and water
charges had not been signed prior to pump installation. Farrers' groups were
quite  heterogeneous   and  a  single  procedure  for  formalizing  group
responsibility was very difficult to impose. As a result, cost recovery for
agricultural inputs and water charges was very difficult, as was the
maintenance of infrastructures by beneficiaries.
1.15      The cropping pattern proposed in the appraisal report consisted of
cotton and sorghum during the rainy season, and wheat and fallow during the
dry season. No marketing problems were anticipated. However, during project
implementation (1978) a re-orientation of the cropping pattern was proposed
to gear it more towards the production of cotton, groundnuts, sorghum,
millet, maize and horse gram during the rainy season, and primarily
vegetables in the dry season. After the subproject's reactivation in 1984,
the major crops cultivated by farmers were vegetables in the cool season, and
groundnuts and rice in the warm and rainy season. The production of
perishable vegetables led to a marketing problem, particularly for tomatoes,
due in part to poor road conditions. This problem was exacerbated by the
increased production of vegetables around .1'Djamena. Extension agents were
unable to offer producers sound technical recommendations or a better system
of crop planning and marketing.
Warehouse Construction Subproject
1.16      The revised program for 80 warehouses and eight fueltanks was fully
completed in 1987, with minor changes in the locations of the proposed new
warehouses that took into account COTONTCHAD's proposals to rationalize its
network of factories. All construction was undertaken by three local building
firms after local competitive bidding and according to standard Genie Rural
design for warehouses.



-6-
Village Water SuDDly Subvroject
1.17      This  subproject  started  well  by  designing  a  mechanism  for
beneficiary participation in the cost of village water supply. As a basic
principle, it was agreed that no works would be started until the beneficiary
community had paid in the full amount of its agreed contribution. Delivery
of drilling equipment and vehicles was made on time and in accordance with
specifications. The war brought about damages and losses of vehicles and
equipment, and a standstill in the implementation of the program. In 1985.
the repair/purchase of well construction and bore-drilling equipment was
necessary and caused delays in the completion of the program.
Feeder Road Improvement Subproject
1.1.      Despite a good start,  the program had to restart in late 1985
because of damages and losses of vehicles and equipment during the civil war.
Execution of the management contract between the subproject and COTONTCHAD
was made difficult at the time by poor technical supervision and management
from COTONTCHAD over its transport section. However, in 1987, the feeder road
program was completed as planned and the Feeder Roads Brigade Management was
transferred to COTONTCHAD.
G.   Finance and Accounts
1.19      The estimated cost of the Rural Projects Fund at appraisal was
about US$13.4 million. The financing plan was that the IDA credit of US$12.0
million would be made to Government to finance 90? of total project costs.
FAC would contribute almost US$1.0 million, or 7Z of project costs. The
remaining project costs (3Z), estimated at US$0.4 million, would be
contributed by beneficiaries in the small-scale irrigation and village water
supply subprojects. Thus, the Government's contribution was nil.
1.20      In 1988, the credit was fully disbursed. Due to war disturbances
resulting in losses of equipment and accounting files, it was very difficult
to reconcile accounts with the documentation of expenditures and/or
commitments for vehicles, equipment and civil works, salaries and operating
costs, and cost recovery financed by beneficiaries. Even after the resumption
of activities in 198r, accounts and audits were behind schedule. Many claims
for payment were submitted late to the FMU by subprojects or suppliers and
were tlius left pending after total disbursement and credit closurs,. This
raises the question of the effectiveness of the audits and other control
mechanisms. However, there is insufficient information Available to make a
judgment.

H.   Disbursements:
1_21      Estimated disbursements of the credit 664-CD are shown in Table
3 in Part III.
I.   Project Results
1.22      The overall results of the Rural Fund Project were mixed. Because
of the civil war, original physical targets were scaled down and the
implementation schedule was revised. At the closing dates (i) under small-
scale irrigation, pump maintenance was financed entirely by farmers and water
charge collections from farmers attained 86S, and 40 ha were cultivated for
millet and sorghum with supplementary irrigation; (ii) under village stores,
80 stores (as planned) were officially accepted; (iii) under feeder roads,
2,300 km had been regraded (out of 2,500 km) and the Feeder Roads Brigade
Management transferred to Cotontchad; (iv) under water supply, 57 water
points completed (out of 110), and 110 handpumps had been received and
officially accepted.
1.23      These three subprojects --village stores, feeder road and water
supply -- could be considered successful. Although benefits are difficult to
quantify, the 80 village stores and the 2,300 km of feeder roads must
certainly have improved the storage and distribution of agricultural inputs,
including cotton seed and fertilizers, thus boosting the productivity of
farmers' main crops, and engendering benefits for Cotontchad.
1.24      The small-scale irrigation subproject was disappointing, however.
Neither the initial goals (42 small-scale pump irrigation perimeters, about
970 ha irrigated) nor the revised project goals (20 perimeters, about 630 ha)
were met. Farmers' disinterest was mainly due to the poor technical design
of irrigation schemes, including water losses, low soil fertility, and crop
marketing problems. Moreover, irrigated cropping was new, labor-intensive,
and had to fit into a completely new farming system. The cropping patterns
proposed were modified from cotton, sorghum, wheat and legumes to sorghum,
rice and vegetables, but without much success. The hoped-for intensive double
cropping did not materialize. The cohesiveness and, thus, discipline of
farmers' groups were poor and many farmers decided to abandon the schemes and
return to dryland or livestock production.
1.25      The major indirect benefit of the Rural Project Fund was the on-
the-job experience acquired by local staff and institutions in the
implementation of simple, easily replicated rural works such as village
stores, feeder roads or water supplies. The small-scale irrigation subproject
apparently was equally simple and easy to implement, but it required a much
better knowledge of farming systems and a participatory approach with future
beneficiaries right from the outset of the irrigation development program.
1.26      One of the objectives of the RPF was also to strengthen the
planning and managerial capacity of the Ministry of Finance, Economy and
Planning in the field of rural development through the creation of a Fund
Management Unit. This objective was probably lost sight of because of the
war and perhaps because of the Ministry's split into two Ministries, Finance
and Planning. Moreover, the seven RPF expatriate staff were not replaced



- 8 -
after the civil war, and the annual training seminars that were to have dealt
with work planning, budgeting and technical matters, were never held. ONDR,
the executing agency for the small-scale irrigation subproject, failed to
learn from the problems experienced in implementing the subproject, for lack
of close monitoring from its management. The FfU's financial management
capacity was improved, but not its planning capacity; an improvement in the
latter would have resulted in more rigorous project selection and more
effective use of foreign aid for rural development.
J.   Project Sustainability
1.27      The project has yielded significant benefits  in the following
areas:
(a) quality and the number of village stores, feeder roads, and
village water supplies:
(b) strengthening, to a certain extent, of the management and
organization of the implementing agencies to enable them to
handle other similar operations;
(c) definition of clear and sound policies for the rural sector
by testing a system of cost recovery from beneficiaries for
maintenance and replacement of investments for small-scale
irrigation perimeters and for village water supplies.
1.28      To  further  improve  the  benefits  and  to  avoid  the  problems
experienced in implementing, managing and monitoring the different
subprojects, the Government needs to focus on continued institutional
development   policy   and  structure.   owrever,   the   adequacy   of  the
Interministerial Governing Comiittee and the role of Government Financial
Control should be reviewed. Moreover, the rural development implementing
agencies should have more autonomy, and should be provided with their own
internal monitoring/evaluation and financial management units. Investment
planning and the capacity to manage foreign aid should be improved. In this
context, it is also important to review government policy in the sector and
the regulatory framework to ensure that they foster the rapid and coherent
development of this vital sector. Some sort of rural projects fund is
absolutely crucial for rural development, but it should be considered only
if there are efficient agricultural support services able with farmers
participation to identify and to design priority small rural investments.



K.   Bank Performance
1.29      Through  the  Rural  Fund  Project,  the  Bank  made  a  positive
contribution to the physical and institutional development of the sector.
Considering the circumstances during project implementation. Bank performance
was satisfactory. In retrospect. however, the following lessons may be
learned from the experience in the project:
(a) a financial contribution to the project by Government would
have motivated the Government to become more involved in
Project implementation.
(b) considering the number of small-scale irrigation perimeters
to be created, and the uncertainties concerning existing
farming systems, soil quality, cropping patterns, and crop
marketing. the Bank should have undertaken a survey with a
participatory approach in existing pilot schemes to better
identify the needs and constraints of future beneficiaries,
and to design irrigation schemes:
(c) advance preparation and procurement action with the RFM unit
would have accelerated the implementation of subprojects such
as village stores, feeder roads, and village water supplies.
thus saving on salaries and recurrent costs of the
implementing agencies:
(d) the Bank should have been more forceful in urging the
Government to give higher priority to staff training in
planning, budgeting and technical matters;
(e) considering the existing unavailability or critical scarcity
of senior managers and technicians after the civil war, the
Bank should have required that Government employ short-term
consultants to help implement the programs and provide on-
the-job staff training; and
(f) Bank supervision missions focussed too much on physical
achievements, losing sight of the objective of creating,
planning and building the managerial capacity of the RFM unit.
L.   Borrower Performance
1.30      Table 7, Part III contains the review of the Borrower's covenant
compliance. Except for the delays in submitting audited accounts and
technical and financial execution reports, the RFM unit's performance was
satisfactory given the circumstances prevailing during the war and the
adjustments needed in order to resume projec.t activities after a four-year
standstill. However, there were delays in setting up the RFM unit and in
appointing key staff. Organizational arrangements were not clearly defined
between executing agencies from different ministries, the RFM unit and the
Interministerial Government Committee. Thus, ths focus in project execution
was diffuse and control was less effective than it could have been. The main



- 10 -
lessons to be learned by the Borrower from the experience of this project
are:
(a)  procurement  preparation  should  commence  as  part  of  the
planning process and should not be related to financing
availibility;
(b)  a project involving several ministries is difficult to manage
and leads to cumbersome procedures. Simplification of project
organization (i.e. by creating a Technical Steering Committee
and thus avoiding an Interministerial Government Committee
with conflictual interests of power) should be sought in the
interest of better management;
(c)  institutional development and training of national staff in
planning, budgeting, and technical matters are key issues for
sustainability.
H.   Proiect Relationship
1.31      The Bank's relationship with Government and RFM unit has always
been excellent where the project is concerned.
N.   Consulting Services
1.32      Technical assistance under the project was intended to fill key
positions am either senior managers or technicians of a type then unavailable
or scarce in Chad: (i) the Deputy Fund Manager; (ii) the three-man technical
assistance team for the small-scale irrigation subproject; (iii) the rural
engineer in charge of bottomltnd development; and (iv) the Village Water
Supplies Unit Chiefs at Ati anAi Houndou. Recruitment was carried out in
accordance with Bank procedures for the use of consultants. The overall
opinion was that their performance was satisfactory. The technical assistants
left Chad during the civil war and, after resumption of the four subprojects,
the management of the small-scale irrigation subproject was reinforced with
one United Nations volunteer as an agronomist and that of the RFM unit with
another United Nation volunteer as Financial Adviser. However, the role of
Financial Adviser was not clearly spelled out and the UN volunteer had some
difficulty defining his advisory role.
0.   Proiect Documentation and Data
1.33      Aside from a few details (para. 1.30), the Credit Agreement in the
case of Credit 664-CD was quite adequate and appropriate for achieving
project objectives in the key organizational and financial areas. The
appraisal report provided both the Bank and the RPM unit with a useful
framework for review of project implementation. However, civil war
disturbances caused losses of assets, files and staff. Thereafter, it was
thus difficult to fill gaps in technical and financial data. Later, due to
a shortage of experienced staff, technical and financial reports were often
inadequate and incomplete, and had only a documentary value.
