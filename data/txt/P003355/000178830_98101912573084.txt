BURMA
POWER PROJECT
I.    THE ENERGY SECTOR
Background
1.01    Burma is well endowed with natural resources.  It has vast arable
land, valuable forest resources and potential unsurveyed mineral deposits. A
key factor in exploiting these natural resources and in expanding the
industrial base is an efficient, broad-based power supply system.
1.02    With industry accounting for only 10% of GDP, GOB is endeavoring to
expand this sector to 22% by 1994. To this end, GOB has planned to set up or
expand existing industries producing cement, fertilizer, glass, textiles,
leather goods, steel, rubber, wood and pharmaceutical products. It also
plans to expand its capacity for rice milling and cotton ginning. If these
plans are to be successfully implemented, the expansion of Burma s power
system is essential.
1.03    GOB fully realizes the importance of an efficient, broad-based power
system to the social and economic development of the country, but due to
financial constraints development has been comparatively slow. The present
(July 1981) total installed generating capacity is only 636 MW, of which 26%
is hydro and 74% is thermal.
Energy Resources
1.04    Commercial primary energy, consisting of oil, natural gas, coal and
hydro power, accounts for about 35% of total energy used in Burma. The
balance (65%) is derived from non-commercial sources, mainly firewood (59%)
and charcoal (6%). Burma's per capita consumption of commercial energy was
90 kg of coal equivalent (kgce) in FY79, and total per capita energy
consumption was about 260 kgce (Annex 1). The 90 kgce consumption figure
compares with 38 kgce in Bangladesh, 107 kgce in Sri Lanka and 178 kgce in
India. 1/
Oil
1.05    Crude oil is one of the major commercial energy sources of Burma.
Production has increased from 7.7 million barrels in FY76 to 11 million
barrels in FY80 (Annex 1), meeting the country's requirement and allowing for
exports of small amounts of petroleum products. Major oil fields are located
along the Irrawaddy river at Chauk, Yenaungyaung and Mann, but detailed
up-to-date information on total reserves is not available. An estimate by
Myanma Oil Corporation (MOC) showed that 138 million barrels of proven
1/   1979 Yearbook of World Energy Statistics (United Nations) and EPC data.



-2-
recoverable reserves were available in FY77, indicating that Burma may have
reserves lasting for only a few years at the present level of production.
Off-shore oil has also been explored, but to date no positive results have
been reported. Burma has been exporting about one million barrels of furnace
and residual oil per annum since 1978. About 200,000 barrels of residual oil
have been used annually for oil fired steam thermals at Ahlone and Ywama
(Rangoon). About 50,000 barrels are likely to be consumed in the new oil
fired steam stations at Moulmein, commissioned in FY80, and Thaton planned to
be commissioned in FY85. On the completion of the proposed transmission
project in FY86, the old stations at Ahlone and Ywama (installed in 1950-55)
are likely to be retired or will remain as standby. Burma would therefore
continue to export the residual oil in the foreseeable future. EPC pays for
diesel fuel and residual oil at the rate of US$12.50 and US$9.50 per barrel
respectively. These prices are considerably below international prices but
are consistent across the power sector.
Natural Gas
1.06    Major gas fields are also located along the Irrawaddy river at
Kyunchaung, Chauk, Mann, Prome and Myanaung. The annual production has
increased from 8.6 billion cubic feet in FY76 to 18 billion cubic feet in
FY80. It is planned to produce 25 billion cubic feet in FY82 (Annex 1).
Daily consumption in FY80 was about 49 million cubic feet, of which 44% was
for power generation, 20% for fertilizer production and the remainder for
other industrial uses. Detailed information on total gas reserves is not
available, though estimates by MOC for major gas fields indicated that in
FY80, proven recoverable reserves were of the order of 600 billion cubic feet
out of a total estimate of 833 billion cubic feet (see Annex 2). This amount
would correspond to only about 24 years consumption at the present
production level. EPC pays for gas at the rate of USc 15 per 1000 cubic
feet. This is considerably lower than the opportunity cost.
Coal
1.07    While there are no known large reserves of coal, a small amount of
coal is being produced in upper Burma. The annual production has varied from
only 10-30 thousand tons during the last five years. The amount imported
annually has also been small, at less than 100 thousand tons.
Hydro Resources
1.08    Burma has abundant potential hydro power resources in its river
systems which drain the four main basins of Chindwin, Irrawaddy, Sittang and
Salween. The theoretical hydro potential of the Salween River along the
international border with Thailand is about 3,500 MW. However no detailed
feasibility studies have been carried out to date, nor has there been any
joint studies of this potential at this time. Estimated theoretical hydro
power potential of the whole country is more than 100,000 MW on an installed



-3-
capacity basis and 370 billion kWh of annual generation, 1/ of which about
five thousand MW and 20 billion kWh of annual generation have been
specifically identified as prospective hydro generation sites by various
pre-feasibility studies. This potential compares to Burma's present (January
1982) hydro development of only 260 MW of installed capacity, including 81 MW
(Sedawagyi and Kinda) under construction (Annex 3), less than one-half of one
percent of the country-s theoretical potential. In view of rather limited
known amounts of fossil energy resources, emphasis should be placed on
further harnessing the country's hydro potential as a means of meeting
Burma-s growing energy demand in the future.
The Power Sub-Sector
Sector Legislation and Organization
1.09 The two main laws pertaining to the power sector are the Electricity
Act of 1910 and the Electricity Supply Act No. 69 of 1948. The latter
amended the 1910 Act with the objective of nationalizing the power supply
industry. Prior to 1951, the Burmese electric supply system had been
operated by several private companies, licensed under the 1910 Act, with a
total installed capacity of about 29 MW. The largest company, supplying
Rangoon, was the Rangoon Electricity Tramway and Supply Company, with an
installed capacity of 16 MW. In 1951 GOB formed the Electricity Supply Board
(ESB) under the Electricity Supply Act of 1948, and all private electricity
companies were nationalized and taken over by ESB. In 1972 ESB was
reorganized into the Electric Power Corporation (EPC) in accordance with
Government Notification No.3 dated March 25, 1972, following a reorganization
of nationalized industries. EPC, under the Ministry of Industry II, is the
entity now responsible for electricity supply throughout Burma.
Previous Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
1.10    Bank Group involvement in the power sector has been only indirect
through Credit 1031-BA for the Kinda (Nyaunggyat) Dam Multipurpose Project
for agriculture, but which includes two 28 MW generators financed by KfW.
This project is now under construction. The Bank also acted as Executing
Agency for the UNDP-financed power development survey completed in July 1978.
The survey-s objectives were to provide for the formulation of a national
generation and transmission development plan for fifteen years and for a
feasibility study for the Paunglaung Hydroelectric Project. As a follow-up
to this study, a detailed engineering study for Paunglaung and a detailed
power system planning and operations review are being carried out by
NORCONSULT under Norwegian assistance. This review includes the
identification of the next hydro power project to follow Paunglaung. The
1/   Burma Power Survey under UNDP/IDA  Project (1976-1978).



-4-
system planning and operations review draft report was completed in January
1982 and the detailed engineering study is scheduled for completion in late
1982.
EPC's System
1.11    EPC presently owns and operates generation facilities of 501 MW
installed capacity, while other government corporations own captive
generating plant with an installed capacity of 135 MW (see Annex 3). Part of
this captive plant is operated on a regular basis in areas remote from the
EPC system, while other plant is for standby use when there is a power
failure. The present EPC system comprises three main systems (see IBRD Map
14546):
(i)     the hydro grid system consisting of the Lawpita hydro
power station (168 MW), the Rangoon thermal power
stations Ahlone (diesel 5 MW and oil fired steam 30 MW),
Ywama (oil fired steam 30 MW and gas turbine 36 MW)
and the Kyunchaung gas power station (54 MW). This
system has 402 km of 230 kV line, 506 km of 132 kV
line and 39 km of 66 kV line interlinking Lawpita and
Kyunchaung power stations with two 230 kV substations
at Hlawga and Tangoo and three 132 kV substations at Thazi,
Chauk and Mandalay. The thermal power stations at
Rangoon are connected to the system through 33 kV lines;
(ii)    the Prome-Myanaung-Myaungmya system consisting of the
Myanaung gas turbine power station (49 MW). This system
has 537 km of 66 kV line interlinking ten 66 kV substations
at Thyat, Prome, Sinde, Nyaungchidauk, Htonbo, Myanaung,
Henzada, Yegi, Bassein, and Myaungmya;
(iii)   the Mann system consisting of the Mann gas turbine power
station (36 MW), which supplies loads in the Mann area
using 33 kV and 11 kV lines.
In addition there are some isolated power stations, totalling 93 MW. These
include the Moulmein oil fired steam plant (12 MW), and about 670 units of
small disel plant scattered throughout Burma.
1.12    The plant under construction are the Prome gas turbines (36 MW),
Chauk gas turbine (14 MW), Lower delta gas turbine (14 MW), Thaton oil fired
steam (18 MW), Sedawagi hydro (25 MW), Kinda hydro (56 MW), and seven mini
hydros (6.85 MW) (ref. Annex 3).



-5-
Status of Supply and Access to Electricity
1.13    The total energy generated by EPC's power stations in FY 80 was 1,080
GWh, of which 67% was hydro generation by the Lawpita power station. Another
24% was supplied by gas fired gas turbines, leaving 9% to steam thermal and
diesel generation. The maximum demand was 185 MW. EPC's daily system load
curve has a typical evening peak of about four hours between 6 and 10 P.M.,
and a daily load factor of about 75%. Seasonal fluctuations are small and
the annual load factor is about 63%. The present generating capacity is
sufficient to cover system peak demand; however, due to the lack of an
adequate transmission network to fully integrate the three isolated systems,
substantial hydro energy was unable to be utilized. Also, had the present
hydro grid system itself been fully integrated, about 200 GWh of thermal
generation could have been saved during FY80, corresponding to an equivalent
fuel savings of about 480,000 barrels of furnace oil, or about 5% of the
country's total 1980 fuel oil consumption. The proposed project would
properly integrate the system and maximize the use of available hydro energy.
1.14    The present plant capacity factor of EPC has been low because:
(i)     oil fired steam thermals at Ahlone and Ywama are
old. The dependable capacity is only 32 MW against
the installed capacity of 65 MW (see Annex 3);
(ii)    the maximum peaking capacity of Lawpita hydro is
130 MW against the installed capacity of 168 MW
because of head race restrictions. EPC is planning
to improve the head race capacity (planned for completion
in FY88 along with Baluchaung No.I), when the peaking
capacity of Lawpita would be 168 MW;
(iii)   gas turbines recently commissioned in Mann have registered
maximum demand of 5 MW against the installed capacity
of 36 MW as the distribution system in that area is
inadequate.
It is expected that the situation will improve on completion of the project.
In FY87 the installed capacity would be about 605 MW (Ahlone and Ywama will
be retired); maximum demand would be 308 MW and units generated would be
1,869 Gwh.
1.15    EPC had 482,000 consumers at the end of FY80, of which 442,000, or
92%, were domestic consumers, and a waiting list numbering 150,000 (para
1.18). Population having access to electricity is estimated at about 7%, and
per capita electricity production is low at about 36 kWh; this compares to 15
kWh in Nepal, 29 kWh in Bangladesh and 170 kWh in India.



-6-
Power Market
1.16    EPC's total energy sales in FY 80 amounted to 763 GWh, of which
industrial consumption accounted for 54%, domestic 29%, commercial 13% and
other consumption, including street lighting and temporary supply 4%. Sales
and generation by category for the past five years are noted in Annex 4.
Demand Forecast
1.17    Electricity sales are projected to increase at an average annual rate
of 9.8% during FYs8l-90, compared to 8.5% during FYs 76-80. However, the
maximum demand in MW is estimated to increase at an average annual rate of
7.9% compared with 9.6% during the past five years. These forecasts assume a
reduction in losses from 32% in FY81 to 20% by FY86 (paras 1.19 - 1.21) and
some improvement in the system load factor. Details of demand forecasts are
shown in Annex 5.
1.18    To arrive at realistic projections, forecasts by consumer category
have been made as follows:
(i)     Industrial Demand.  Since industrial demand accounts
for more than 50% of the total demand, it is essential
that this forecast be particularly reliable. Consequently,
the expected demand of 65 proposed large industries was
critically examined. The original forecast was considered
ambitious and appropriately revised. The revised demand was
added to that of the existing 22 industries (Table 2 of Annex 5).
Small industries are estimated to grow at about 3% per
year. Overall the average growth rate is estimated
at 11.5% per year during FYs 81-90, compared to 9.3% over
the past five years.
(ii)    Domestic Sales Demand Growth.  During the past five years
(FYs76-80), total domestic consumption increased at an
average annual rate of 8.6%, of which 6.1% was
attributable to the increased consumption by connected
consumers, and the rest to the consumption of new
consumers. The average consumption per consumer was low
at 44 kWh per month in FY81. Domestic sales are expected
to increase steadily in the next ten years at an annual
growth rate of 8.5%, about the same as the past trend
of 8.6% (Annex 5). There is a waiting list for connections
numbering aout 150,000. EPC has been unable to supply
these connections due to a lack of distribution material,
transformers and meters. The situation however is
being alleviated by a recently completed distribution
transformer factory and by a meter factory which has been
in operation the past few years and is now producing



-7-
about 25,000 single phase meters annually. This has
helped EPC to increase the number of connections from
about 1,600 in FY76 to mnore than 13,000 in each of the
FYs 80 and 81. ilowever, there are still constraints
due to a shortage of other distribution items such as
switchgear and cables, and EPC has arranged through a
Yugoslavian loan to procure these distribution line
materials and equipment in order to strengthen the
distribution system.
(iii)   Bulk, Commercial and Other Growth.  Based on the
historical trend, bulk and commercial demand is
expected to increase by 6-7%, and other types of demand
by 2% per annum.
System Losses
1.19    EPC's system losses are high, amounting to a estmated 32% in FY81.
An estimated breakdown of losses is station use, 2.2%; transmission, 7.5% and
distribution, 22.3%. The high distribution loss is due to a heavily loaded
distribution system and to meters needing calibration.
1.20    EPC attempted a loss analysis study during 1980 with little result.
Also, there is a lack of adequate meter testing facilities for a periodic
meter testing program. The existing testing equipment is more than thirty
years old and is inadequate to calibrate both new and old meters, leaving EPC
calibrating only new meters. The project, therefore, provides for the
installation of new testing facilities and for an adequate number of spare
meters for industrial use to allow the old meters to be replaced and
calibrated. Losses can also be reduced by improving the power factor through
installing capacitors.  The project provides for appropriate capacitors to be
installed in the power system. The distribution system needs strengthening,
especially in Rangoon, and EPC has arranged financing from Yugoslavia for
this purpose.
1.21    A system loss reduction unit headed by a superintending engineer was
recently established in November 1981. During negotiations the following was
agreed in connection with organizing and operating the system loss reduction
unit:
(i)     A specialist would be retained with experience in
(a) assessing losses in an electrical power system,
(b) organizing a unit to deal with losses and (c)
establishing a program for effective loss reduction;
(ii)    the terms of reference for the specialist would be
finalized, in consultation with the Association, by
June 30, 1982; he would be recruited by November 30,

1982; and the organization and staffing of the unit
would be completed by February 28, 1983;
(iii)   a loss reduction program with the aim of reducing
system losses to 20Z by FY87 would be established
by May 30, 1983.

II.     THE BENEFICIARY
Authority and Legal Status
2.01    The beneficiary would be the Electric Power Corporation (EPC), a
statutory corporation under the Ministry of Industry II (MI-2); MI-2 has
jurisdiction over power, heavy industry and petroleum. EPC has
responsibility for construction, operation and maintenance of electricity
supply facilities throughout Burma. It has reasonable autonomy in its
conduct of day-to-day business. HIowever, in matters of policy and
substantive decisions, such as setting tariffs, capital investment, contract
awards, tariffs, salaries and wages and appointment of senior staff, EPC
defers decisions to MI-2 and Central Government.
Organization and Management
2.02    The Managing Director of EPC, under the direction of the Minister
of MI-2, is responsible for the operation and management of the Corporation.
He is appointed by the Council of State on the recommendation of the Cabinet
and is assisted by the EPC Board of Management consisting of seven members,
who are also appointed by the Minister, MI-2. The Board, which functions as
an advisory body, comprises the seven most senior EPC officers, including
the Managing Director as Chairman.
2.03   There are four operating departments located at the head office in
Rangoon: Engineering, Finance, Stores and Administration, the heads of which
report to the Managing Director. There are fourteen regional offices, the
heads of which also report to the Managing Director. Each of these regional
offices is headed by an engineer who is responsible for the operation and
management of electric utility services within his respective State/Division.
In addition, there are fourteen other operation and maintenance units: six
for power stations, five for substations, two for transmission lines and one
for generation projects. The present organization structure is generally
satisfactory, other than there being more than the normal number of
executives reporting to the Managing Director. For the time being, the EPC
organization, including the proposed Planning Department (para. 2.07), would
be acceptable. At a later time, when the Planning Department is fully
established, consideration should be given to streamlining the organization.
EPC's organization chart is shown in Annex 6.
Training
2.04    EPC is one of the largest employers in Burma.  As of March 1981, its
staff numbered 11,515, of which 10,032 were permanent. EPC recognizes the
importance of training and has its own training program designed to upgrade
the skills of its managers, engineers, accountants, technicians and skilled
labor. Training takes the form of on-the-job and class room training with
the duration of courses depending upon the subject matter. There is



-10-
continuous organized on-the-job training in the operation and maintenance of
generating plant, and in construction and maintenance of substations and
transmission and distribution lines. One method of training that EPC has
found to be effective consists of teams of experienced engineers and
technicians visiting on-going as well as recently completed projects to
conduct training. Purely classroom training is provided for in respect of
power system management, EPC township management and financial, stores and
service regulations. EPC plans to start two new courses for high school
graduates in basic theory and practice of power station, sub-station and
transmission line operation and maintenance. Training is also imparted to
the EPC staff through foreign contractors operating in Burma. For example,
the project would provide training of EPC staff in the erection of the
proposed 230 kV bundled transmission lines for a period of six months (para.
3.15). The project would also provide training abroad for operators for load
dispatching and for engineers for line construction. EPC will also identify
other training needs and advise the Association by September 30, 1982.
2.05    In the last five years (1977-81), 103 EPC  engineers have received
training abroad in such subjects as electric power distribution, development
and operation of hydro power stations, including small scale hydro schemes,
HV transmission and thermal electric power stations, including diesel and gas
turbines. A total of 470 staff received training in the technical aspects of
the business during FYs8O and 81.
2.06    The finance and accounting staff receive training in EPC's own
courses and also from the Government's Institute of Accounts and Audit
sponsored by the Central Accounts Office. The courses last from one to six
months and are tailored to the needs of the particpant, covering, for
example, fundamental principles of bookkeeping for the junior staff and
advanced accounting and financial planning for the more senior staff.
Planning Department
2.07    EPC has a technically competent staff; however, its operations have
been hampered by the absence of a definitive planning department to properly
plan, coordinate and execute projects. Thermal generation plants of odd
sizes have been added to the system without advance planning (para 3.01) and
without establishing the least cost solution. The planning that existed
rested with the Ministry where it appears to have been done on an ad hoc
basis. The planning function having been located outside of EPC's
jurisdiction limited EPC's planning initiative and has led to the EPC
departments operating in isolation from one another. The Minister, MI-2, who
recognizes the need for establishing an effective planning group, advised
that a nucleus of a Planning Directorate has recently been established within
EPC.



-11-
2.08    In order to organize and develop the Directorate into an effective
planning unit, certain actions are required. In this regard, it was agreed
during negotiations that GOB would enable EPC to take the following actions:
(i)     To arrange, by December 1, 1982, to send a small team of senior
officers (engineering and financial officers) to visit a power
enterprise to observe and discuss the planning function in
order to gain insight into the operation of a planning
department;
(ii)    following the above visit and not later than June 30, 1983,
retain an outside specialist, satisfactory to the
Association, for a period of two to three years to advise
and work with EPC in strengthening the operations of the
Planning Directorate; and
(iii)   finalize the terms of reference for the specialist by
March 31, 1983, in consultation with the Association.
Accounting and Audit
2.09    EPC's senior accounting staff is capable and the accounting system
follows generally accepted commercial practices. There are however
weaknesses, recognized by EPC management, that need correcting in the areas
of stores accounting, billing and collection and internal audit. A major
factor in these weaknesses is the lack of reliable accounting machines,
resulting in the accounting operation being conducted largely manually at a
time when EPC's operations are expanding. The Rangoon Division tries to
operate an antiquated punch card data processing system but this is
frequently under repair. Under these conditions EPC has been finding it
increasingly difficult to cope. A recent ADB power loan is providing the
necessary assistance and EPC is taking action to strengthen these areas (for
details see Annex 7).
2.10    Vacancies in senior finance posts weaken the financial operations.
The two most senior finance posts under the Director of Finance (two Deputy
Directors) have remained vacant for the past few years, causing the financial
operations to suffer.  The Director of Finance is having to devote an
inordinate amount of time to overseeing details of the financial operations,
leaving too little time to deal with broader, more important financial
matters. For example, attention should be given to strengthening the
accounting operations in the regions so that there is more control exerted
over their townships, which would enable more timely accounting and
operational information to be made available. This would also help EPC to
reduce the time it now takes to close its annual accounts, which is a major
factor in delaying the external audit. Also, with EPC-s need to strengthen



-12-
areas of its financial operations, the augmentation of senior staff would be
well timed. During negotiations, agreement was reached that the two vacant
posts of Deputy Director, Finance would be filled by suitable officers as
soon as practicable, but in any case by not later than March 31, 1983.
2.11    Under Burmese law, the Council of People's Inspectors, the most
senior independent body for inspection and audit of public undertakings, is
responsible for the external audit of EPC's accounts. It discharges this
responsibility through one of its special groups, the Central Accounts Office
which assigns fifteen staff to audit EPC's accounts on a continuous basis.
2.12    Previously EPC had agreed, under ADB loans, to provide certified
copies of its audited financial statements, together with the auditor's
report, within six months of the end of the fiscal year. However, this
timing has not been achieved due to the delay in the finalizing of EPC's
accounts. In the past it has taken as long as two years to have the
accounts ready for the external audit. The reasons for this delay are the
field units' tardiness in their submissions, and transportation difficulties;
some areas are virtually inaccessible, and bad weather conditions for a large
part of the year contribute to delays. Nevertheless, with concentrated
effort, EPC has been able to reduce the period for preparing its accounts to
about one year.
2.13    In view of these practical difficulties, the most recent ADB loan
requirement stipulates that EPC is to furnish unaudited financial statements
within nine months of the end of the fiscal year and audited financial
statements, together with the auditor's report within twelve months. In
these circumstances, it is considered that this requirement is realistic at
this time and should form the audit covenant for the proposed Credit. This
was agreed during negotiations. It was also agreed that the Association
would monitor these arrangements and, if necessary, would request that
outside assistance, from within Burma, be made available to assist in the
timely performance and completion of the audit.
Fixed Asset Recording and Accounting
2.14    Currently EPC does not maintain a fixed asset register.  The record
of fixed assets gives only a lump sum figure by category and does not provide
data, such as date of purchase, date of commissioning, details of scheduled
maintenance, unit cost and estimated life, which are required for proper
asset valuation and depreciation accounting. In order to achieve the
objectives of proper operation and accounting, it was agreed during
negotiations that the following tasks are required to be carried out:
(i)     a physical count of the assets in distribution,
transmission, generation and at headquarters;



-13-
(ii)    recording the assets in registers;
(iii)   determining values;
(iv)    establishing a depreciation policy and applying the
rates;
(v)     reconciling the values established with the books
of account; and
(vi)    maintaining records of commissioning, repairs
and maintenance.
A proper fixed asset recording and accounting system would also enable the
external auditor to verify the fixed assets and render an opinion on the
accounting for them which heretofore has not been possible. Establishing
these systems is a large task, and one which must be accomplished if the
balance sheet is to be a meaningful document.
2.15    During negotiations, it was agreed that EPC would retain outside
assistance (possibly from within Burma) to assist in this work, and that the
actions to be taken are: (l) finalizing of the terms of reference for outside
assistance, in consultation with the Association, by September 30, 1982; (ii)
recruiting outside assistance by December 31, 1982; and (iii) establishing
the fixed asset recording and accounting systems by March 1, 1984.
Revaluation of Assets
2.16    To reflect realistic costs using proper depreciation charges requires
that assets be valued in current prices. With EPC being asked to establish
an asset register and a system of asset accounting, this would be a
propitious time for EPC to also establish a satisfactory method for valuing
its assets on a current basis and for regularly revaluing them in the future.
Therefore, concurrently with establishing a system for recording and
accounting for fixed assets, EPC should undertake to maintain the valuation
of its fixed assets at current prices, using a method of revaluation
satisfactory to the Association. During negotiations, it was agreed that EPC
would complete a review of the methodology for revaluing its fixed assets and
forward its recommendations to the Association for comment and concurrence by
March 31, 1983. It was further agreed that, if warranted by the findings of
the review, EPC would revalue its fixed assets using methods satisfactory
to the Association.

III.     THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
A. The Program
3.01    EPC's investment program for the ten-year period FY81-90 is shown in
Annex 8. During the four-year period, FY83-86, when the Association would be
financing the proposed project, EPC plans to spend the following amounts on
generation, transmission and distribution facilities:
Amount
Facility                 (million kyats)
Generation                    1,941
Transmission                  1,395
Distribution                    386
3,722
Out of K1,395 million to be spent on transmission facilities, the project
accounts for K927 million, or 66%. The followng table lists the generation
facilities together with the year of commissioning and the source of funds
where available. Primary transmission and sub-transmission works are
discussed in paras. 3.03 and 3.04.

-15-
3.02    EPC has also secured funds from  Austria to build seven mini hydro
plants totaling 6.85 MW. In addition, funds have been secured from ADB to
carry out feasibility studies at ten additional sites where hydro potential
has been identified, amounting to 17 KW.
Primary Transmission Works
3.03    EPC has arranged financing from KfW to build a 230 kV transmission
line between Toungoo and Thazi (241 km). The line is scheduled to be
commissioned in FY85. A 132 kV line from Kyaunchang to Monywa (192 km) has
been constructed by EPC through its own resources and is scheduled for
commissioning in FY82. The main transmission work planned by EPC forms the
proposed project.
Sub-Transmission and Distribution Works
3.04    EPC plans to construct by FY90 about 650 km of 33 kV, 1200 km of 11
kV, 240 km of 6.6 kV and 3500 km of 400 volt lines. EPC also plans to add
about 110 MVA transformer capacity on the 33/11 and 33/6.6 kV systems and
about 100 MVA transformer capacity on 11/0.4 and 6.6/0.4 kV systems.
B. The Project
Purpose and Description of the Project
3.05    The proposed project emerged from the need to provide for the
transmission of power from generation facilities already established (para
1.11) or which are under construction, (para. 1.12) and takes into account
the need for integrating future generating facilities into the grid system
to meet growing demand. (See IBRD Map 14546 and Annex 9.)
3.06    The project would comprise:
(i)    Transmission lines:  erection of about 414 km of
230 kV and 229 km of 132 kV single circuit lines with
an estimated total cost of US$73.5 million equivalent,
including US$43.2 million in foreign exchange;
(ii)   Substations and associated equipment:  construction and
expansion of eight substations of 230, 132, and 66 kV with
an aggregate transformer capacity of 330 MVA at an estimated
cost of US$42.5 million equivalent, including US$23.3 million
in foreign exchange;
(iii) Load dispatch center and meter testing equipment;



-16-
(iv)   Consulting services for (a) project management,
(b) system loss reduction, (c) fixed asset accounting
system and (d) establishing a planning department;
(v)    Feasibility study of a suitable hydro electric project
to be selected to follow the Paunglaung project; and
(vi)   Training of EPC officials.
The project is described in more detail in Annex 10.
3.07    The design of the project is based on comprehensive load flow,
stability and short circuit studies carried out by the consulting engineers
(Norconsult). In the design of the 230 kV lines, two conductors of 605 MCM
per phase (bundled) have been chosen. The main features of the transmission
lines and substations are tabulated below:

-17-
3.08    In order to adequately supply Rangoon's load demand from the proposed
transmission project, EPC also plans to construct by December 31, 1984, 66 kV
(initially 33 kV operated) overhead transmission lines and associated
substation facilities as shown below (see IBRD Map 16002):
a) a 5 km 66 kV (initially 33 kV operated) transmission line (ACSR
266.8 MCM, 2 circuits) between the Pathein-Nyunt
substation (existing, 33/6.6 kV) and the Thaketa substation,
and two 33 kV switch bays at the Pathein-Nyunt substation;
b) a 7 km 66 kV (initially 33 kV operated) transmission line (ACSR
266.8 MCM, 2 circuits,) between a new 33 kV Thingangyun
substation and the Thaketa substation, and substation facilities
at Thingangyun; and
c) a 1 km 66 kV (initially 33 kV operated) transmission line (ACSR
266.8 MCM, 2 circuits) between the Thaketa substation
and the existing Syriam-MOC line.
3.09    The above mentioned facilities are important for the proper operation
of the project. During negotiations, it was agreed that all necessary action
would be taken to assure completion of these facilities by December 31, 1984.
3.10    At present, EPC has no load dispatching facilities.  All information
required for day-to-day operations and for long-term system planning is
obtained through power line carrier telephone, which is inadequate. The
project provides for telemetering and teleindication of important information
to the dispatch center from substations and power stations covered under the
proposed project (see Annex 10). During negotiations, agreement was reached
that EPC would make arrangements to provide similar facilities for the
remaining substations and power stations in the system.
Estimated Costs
3.11    The estimated cost of the project, excluding interest during
construction, but including duties and taxes, is K927.5 million (US$132.5
million equivalent). The estimated costs are shown in Annex 11 and
summarized in the table below:

To determine the quantities of material and equipment required, the
consulting engineer (Norconsult) surveyed the alignment of the transmission
lines and prepared a detailed schedule of equipment for each line and
substation. Reasonable allowances have been made however for variations by
providing 15% physical contingencies for substation equipment and
construction, 10% for supervisory engineering and 10% for transmission line
material and construction. Cost estimates of the equipment are based on

mid-1981 international prices and compare with prices for similar equipment
that has been recently imported to Burma.
3.12    The proposed credit of US$80 million would cover the project's total
foreign exchange requirement, which is 60% of the cost of the project. An
estimated breakdown of the foreign cost is: US$66.5 million for equipment
and materials US$2.5 million for a feasibility study of a hydro electric
project that would follow Paunglaung, US$10.0 million for supervisory
engineering/consulting and training, and US$1.0 million for a load
dispatching center and meter testing equipment. The foreign cost of
equipment includes supervision during erection and commissioning by the
contractors.   The estimated local costs of K367 million (US$52.5 million),
would be financed by EPC mainly through loans obtained from the Myanma
Economic Bank in Burma. (See para. 4.08 for a discussion on EPC financing
its investment program with debt).
Engineering
3.13    Detailed design and tender documents for transmission lines,
substations, the load dispatch center and meter testing equipment have been
prepared by Norconsult under the existing agreement with EPC. Supervisory
engineering and project management subsequent to the preparation of tender
documents is included in the project. During negotiations, it was agreed
that EPC would finalize the TOR, in consultation with the Association, for
the work of the project management team in sufficient time for the services
to be available before September 30, 1982. These engineering consultancy
services would require about 350 man months of work at an estimated cost of
US$4.6 million. The average man month cost is US$11,800 (salary and overhead
expense - $10,000, travel - $500, subsistence - $1,300). Also included is
the vehicle operation and maintenance cost and local office expenses. It was
also agreed that EPC would advise the Association as to the identification of
the hydro electric project to follow Paunglaung. It was further agreed that
TOR for preparing the feasibility report for this project would be forwarded
to the Association by September 30, 1982.
Force Account
3.14    EPC will use its own staff for erecting transmission lines and
construction of other facilities under the proposed transmission project.
EPC has considerable experience in erecting transmission lines, and has
demonstrated by past performance that it is capable. EPC staff added an
additional circuit to the 132 kV Lawpita-Thazi line under energized
conditions in 1975 . It also completed erection of the 132 kV single circuit
transmission line in 1981 from Kyunchaung to Monywa (192 km, an ADB project)
in only nine months, a creditable performance. Hence, the project
construction schedules are based on realistic performance of EPC's own crews
which reflects progress rates on recently completed projects. EPCs mode of
operation is to form construction teams with a nucleus consisting of



-20-
engineers, foremen, and skilled laborers, who are EPC permanent staff. The
team is augmented by additional staff, including assistant engineers, all on
a temporary basis. Other unskilled work, such as delivering tower materials
to individual tower locations and digging tower footings, is carried out by
casual labor from villages. Thus, EPC is able to limit the size of its
construction staff to that which is required on a full-time basis for its
construction programs. In carrying out this work, it was agreed during
negotiations that the required construction equipment, which is locally
procured and consists mainly of vehicles (jeeps, trucks and tractor
trailers), would be supplied by GOB to EPC on a priority basis.
3.15    Since some of the lines under the project consist of bundle
conductors and are of a 230 kV rating, it is proposed to train the EPC work
force through one of the equipment suppliers for the initial six months- work
on the Hlawga-Prome section. The cost of experts for this training, is
covered by the proposed Credit.
Project Management
3.16    EPC has created a new unit headed by a competent project director to
supervise and implement the project. He will be assisted by two
superintending engineers and necessary support staff (see Annex 13). During
negotiations, it was agreed that EPC would fill the necessary posts under the
project director on a priority basis.
Construction Schedule
3.17    It is not physically possible to work in paddy fields during rains.
The construction schedule has therefore been made in such a way that erection
of 332 km of 230 kV lines passing through paddy areas is done only during dry
months (November to May), the rainy period being utilized for erection of 311
km of the lines passing through non-paddy areas. Keeping in view the
aforesaid limitation of working in paddy areas during the dry season, the
erection timetable would be as follows:



-21-
Section                    Terrain                Erection Period
Hlawga-Prome                Paddy area            Nov. 83 to May 84
Oct. 84 to March 85
Prome-Aunglan              Paddy Area             Feb. 85 to June 85
Aunglan-Taungdwingyi       Non-paddy area         April 84 to Sept. 84
Taungdwingyi-JCT-Mann      Non-paddy area         Aug. 84 to Nov. 84
May 85 to Sept. 85
Chauk-JCT                  Non-paddy area         Aug. 85 to March 86
There will be some overlap, as on certain occasions work will be done on two
sections concurrently (for details see Annex 14). Estimates for key
commissioning dates of various sections, including the relevant substations,
are:
230 kV line up to Prome - May 1985
230 kV line up to Taungdwingyi - July 1985
132 kV line up to Chauk and Mann - April 1986.
Procurement and Disbursement
3.18    All materials including construction equipment and cost of
transmission line training totaling US$70 million would be split into
suitable packages and procured by ICB in accordance with IDA guidelines. It
was agreed during negotiations that all bidding packages estimated to cost
over US$100,000 would be subject to IDA-s prior review of procurement
documentation, resulting in a coverage of virtually all of the estimated cost
of the contracts. Equipment, spare parts, materials and grouping thereof,
estimated to cost the equivalent of or less than US$100,000, and which are
required urgently or which are not suitable for international bidding may,
however, be procured under normal GOB/EPC procurement procedures (on the
basis of bids from no less than 3 independent suppliers). l1 Such purchases
would be limited to a maximum of US$1.0 million. A price preference of 15%
of CIF or custom duties, whichever is less, will be granted to local
manufacturers for procurement of equipment.
3.19    Disbursement from the proposed credit would be made for:
1/ The procedures are satisfactory to IDA.

(a)   100% of the foreign exchange cost of imported
equipment and material and 100% of cost of local

(b)   100% of foreign expenditures for foreign consultants
and training; and 100% of local expenditures for local
consultants.
3.20    A disbursement schedule, based on the construction program, was
discussed in detail with EPC and the consulting engineer during appraisal.
It was agreed that it would be possible to implement the program as planned
(refer to Annex 14). A comparison of disbursement however has been made
between an average profile of nine IBRD-financed transmission and
distribution projects and the proposed project. (See following table.)

The estimated disbursement for this project is lower than the Bank-s average
profile in the first 1 1/2 years, recognizing the expected phasing of
materials delivery. Expected disbusements later accelerate to a more rapid
pace than normal, reflecting to some extent that they are for materials which
must be paid for earlier than in those projects which include erection costs.



-23-
Final disbursement is expected to be within six months of 95% of the average
for similar Bank projects. The disbursement schedule based on the
construction program has therefore been retained.
Environmental Impact
3.21    The environmental impact of the project would be negligible.  The
overhead high voltage lines would pass through crop growing fields or bush
and forest areas. All substations of the project have been sited away from
congested areas. Construction, of necessity, would take place between the
paddy crops. In Burma once the construction is completed, land beneath the
transmission lines would be available for cropping.
Risks
3.22    There are no risks of significance associated with the project.  In
order to cater for variations in the scope of work and to avoid any cost
overruns, physical and price contingencies have been included in costing the
project. Also sufficient allowances for spare parts for equipment used for
the project have been included. The erection through force account does not
constitute a major risk, considering EPC's experience in this type of
transmission line.

IV.      FINANCES
Background
4.01    In pricing for electricity services in Burma, GOB's policy has been
to keep industrial tariffs low in order to reduce electricity costs of
industrial users and favor industrialization. GOB's motivation for
subsidizing industrial electricity is a strong one, despite potential
unfavorable economic implications. Such a policy could be the source of
incorrect economic signals in planning industrial development where
electricity is used, resulting in inefficient utilization of energy. But
from the viewpoint of EPC, whose industrial sales account for an increasing
proportion of total sales -- presently 54% and forecast to rise to about 65%
by 1986 -- the underpricing of these sales is adversely affecting its
finances.
4.02    GOB has two policies of importance in this context.  First, in common
with other centrally planned economies, it has a prime objective of
maintaining stable price levels over time (effectively no inflation; in
actual fact it is estimated at 1% annually in recent years). Second, it has
a policy that its state economic enterprises should be financially viable
and cover their costs and repay the state (society) for the resources
invested. These two policies, needless to say, may be in conflict in an era
of rising costs elsewhere. To assure that total investment is recovered,
GOB also has a policy of not providing equity to state economic enterprises,
and to finance such enterprises with debt (with debt service as required).
Although this system varies from western practice, it does accomplish
fundamental objectives. In equilibrium, in Burma, the state enterprises
cover their operating and maintenance costs and provide a return of and on
capital to society as represented by debt interest and amortization.
Tariffs
4.03    In providing electricity, an enterprise is faced with two types of
costs. First, it must provide for capital investment for which costs are
fixed and related to total capacity. Second, variable costs, such as fuel
and operating costs, must be provided. In order to assure efficient use of
facilities, larger consumers should pay a demand charge to reflect fixed
costs and pay energy charges to reflect variable costs. In Burma-s case, it
has not instituted demand charges, even for industrial consumers. Further,
the tariff is based on a block system with kWh charges declining with
increasing use, which is questionable since increased use means more fuel



-25-
must be consumed. 1/ Moreover the present overall tariff level (taking into
account a recent 142.5% increase) is low with the average charge per kWh
amounting to 28.2 pyas (USc4.0). Domestic rates average 43.6 pyas (USc6.2) per
kWh and compare to low industrial tariffs of only 18.5 pyas (USc2.6). These
charges compare to a likely range of weighted long run marginal cost (LRMC)
of 60-71 pyas. 2/ In order for EPC to maintain even the present level of
revenue per kWh, additional tariff increases are necessary, because the
increasing proportion of industrial sales together with their underpricing
has the effect of lowering the overall average revenues per kWh. With the
proportion of industrial sales increasing, their continued underpricing would
preclude EPC from maintaining financial viability. Present tariffs are set
out in Annex 15.
4.04    Under the Kinda (Nyaunggyat) Dam Multipurpose Project, EPC, with the
assistance of IDA staff, recently completed a tariff study. The study-s
recommendations are:
(i)     introduction of capacity charges for high and medium
voltages;
(ii)    elimination of the present decreasing block structure to
encourage economic consumption;
(iii)   reduction in the number of user categories;
(iv)    introduction of different tariffs for different voltage
levels within consumer categories (high, medium and low);
(v)     consolidation of Rangoon and outside Rangoon into one
tariff;
1/ The block system of tariff attempts to function as a proxy for
demand/energy charges but is unsatisfactory because it is unable to reflect
the utilization of plant. For example, with two consumers each using 5000
kWh annualy, one may require 25 KW for 200 hours and the other 1 kW for 5000
hours; the former would require 25 times more investment in plant, but under
the Burmese tariff structure, each would pay about the same charge.
2/ The lower limit of the range is based on an opportunity value of natural
gas related to net value of fertilizer production. The upper limit of the
range is based on a natural gas value related to the heat rate equivalent
of imported petroleum products.



-26-
(vi)    introduction of a power factor surcharge as a means of
encouraging consumers, especially large ones, to improve
their power factor where appropriate; and
(vii)   introduction of a fuel price surcharge.
4.05    The need is clear for EPC to raise overall tariff levels and to
restructure its tariffs to encourage economic use, especially for industrial
users. The tariff study's recommended tariff structure is rational and would
establish the framework within which EPC's tariffs would take a step toward
reflecting the marginal cost of supplying electricity to different categories
of consumers. During negotiations, agreement was reached with GOB for
restructuring EPC tariffs along the lines recommended in the tariff study,
and to coordinate restructuring timewise with the next tariff increase (para
4.10).
Earnings Covenant
4.06    In selecting the type of earnings covenant to be applied, a cash
generation covenant lends itself to EPC's present financial circumstances for
a number of reasons. Following GOB policy, EPC is expected to finance its
capital expansion primarily with debt so that the focus at this time should
be on raising tariffs sufficiently to enable debt service coverage by
internal cash generation. A cash generation covenant would be a direct link
to this requirement and would be consistent with GOB's policy of requiring
state enterprises to service their debt. Such a covenant should be
considered rational by GOB, and therefore more readily acceptable than, for
example, a rate of return covenant. Finally, EPC neither maintains a fixed
asset register, operates a system of asset accounting nor recognizes
revaluation, thus rendering a rate of return covenant impractical at this
time.
4.07    A cash generation covenant would normally be expected to provide
sufficient revenues to finance a percentage of capital investment after
covering debt servlce. However, in the case of EPC (and Burma), if all
expansion is financed with debt (and where there is little equity base to
start with), there is logic that EPC be required to cover debt service alone.
If the combination of debt interest and annual loan repayment represents a
reasonable return on and of capital, then there has actually been a
reasonable return on investment. In effect, resources "loaned" by the
economy to EPC are returned to the economy. In fact, if interest on loans
reflects the cost of capital in a country and if the repayment period is
comparable to the life of the asset, then tariffs determined by revenues
covering operating costs and debt service, with 100% debt financing, would
approach the marginal cost of electricity over time at constant price



-27-
levels.1/ In this context, it should be noted that EPC pays substantial
duties and taxes (para. 4.20) and that its capital investment and loans
reflect this.
4.08    In the case of EPC, it is unlikely that it could generate significant
revenues for financing part of its capital investment in addition to covering
debt service. GOB-s policy of not providing equity to state enterprises in
effect requires EPCGs capital expansion to be financed almost wholly with
debt, resulting in heavy debt service payments. Under these conditions,
forecasts show that the average tariff will need to be about doubled (from
the present 28.2 pyas (USc4.0) to about 54 pyas (USc7.7) over the next six
years in order for EPC to meet its debt service.
4.09    It should be noted that domestic users are already paying the
equivalent of USc6.2 per kWh. The charges for industrial consumers, who are
paying the equivalent of only USc2.6, will have to be raised substantially if
EPC is to balance income with its operating costs and debt service. Such a
change in pricing would signal a significant departure in GOB's present
policy of subsidizing industrial consumption. Thus, while the conceived
power tariff increases may not generate sufficient revenue to make a
contribution to capital expansion at this time, it nevertheless would be
economically and financially viable, enabling EPC to fulfill its economic
obligation to the economy, and meet its financial obligations and achieve
financial viability.
4.10    In arriving at an earnings covenant, it was agreed during
negotiations that EPC would be enabled to carry out a phased program of
timely and adequate adjustments of the levels of tariffs as necessary to
cover its operating costs and debt service requirements, as follows:
(i)     for fiscal years 1984 and 1985, all operating costs
and at least 75% of debt service requirements;
(ii)    for fiscal years 1986 and 1987, all operating costs
and at least 85% of debt service requirements; and
(iii)   for fiscal year 1988 and each fiscal year thereafter,
all operating costs and 100% of debt service  requirements;
1/ It is likely that GOB, as in other LDCGs, may wish to favor EPC with
loans at lower interest rates than normal. On the other hand, it is also
normal that loan repayment periods are shorter than actual asset life. To
some extent, this situation results in counterbalance.



-28-
It was further agreed that EPC would annually review in January each year
the adequacy of its revenues on the basis of a carefully prepared forecast
satisfactory to the Association, as shall be required to comply with (i),
(ii) and (iii) above, and furnish the Association with a copy of the review
promptly upon its completion.
Past Operations
4.11    Income statements for FYs 78-81 are shown in Annex 16.  The following

Debt/equity ratio                          26/74   40/60   51/49   56/44
4.12    The foregoing figures show that operating results deteriorated during
the four-year period, with the rate of return, already at a low level,
declining from 4.9% to 4.2% on a historical rate base. Had assets been
revalued, increased depreciation would have eliminated income and resulted
in a slight loss. The rate of return is calculated after EPC payments to
Government equivalent to a tax. These payments consist of a commodity and
service tax of 10% on the unit sales of electricity for other than industrial
consumption, plus 30% of net income after interest and after the
aforementioned commodity and service tax. These two payments were equivalent
to 36% of net operating income during the four-year period FY 78-81. Had
these taxes (effectively transfer payments) been included with income, the
return would have approximated 7.0% as compared with the approximately 4.5%
financially recorded.
4.13    Pressure on EPC's finances is mainly due to low tariffs, increasing
debt service and increasing system losses (discussed in paras. 1.19-1.21).



-29-
Industrial tariffs have been particularly low, with some industrial
categories paying as little as 8 pyas (UScl.14) per kWh. As noted earlier,
the present overall industrial rate, after the recent tariff increase, is on
the low side at USc2.6 equivalent per kWh. The underpricing of industrial
sales coupled with their high proportion of total sales (presently 54%) has
been a major factor in EPC-s financial position.
4.14    Debt service has had an increasing call on internal cash generation
to the extent that in FYs8O and 81 internal cash was insufficient to cover
debt service. This is due to EPC having to finance its capital investment
primarily with debt because of GOB-s policy since 1976 of not providing
equity.
Present Financial Position
4.15    Balance sheets for FYs 78-81 are shown in Annex 17. The present book
value of fixed assets is shown at historical cost. A high proportion of the
assets, including work-in-progress, has been recently added, the amount
having increased by 125% during the last four years. About 90% of the
increase has been financed with borrowings and the remaining 10% from EPCGs
internal sources.
4.16    The new system of asset accounting proposed to be established (para
2.15) would provide for the classification of fixed assets and would be the
basis for calculating depreciation. In the meantime, EPC has been applying a
composite rate for depreciation of about 3%, which is realistic.
4.17    EPCs capitalization as of March 31, 1981 is summarized as follows:
US$ million
Kyats million   Equivalent        %
Equity
Government investment         707.3        101.0          38
Retained earnings             119.6         17.1           6
Total equity           826.9        118.1          44
Long-Term Debt                1,066.0        152.3          56
Total Capital        1,892.9        270.4         100
4.18    The foregoing figures show a debt/equity ratio of 56/44, which
compares to a ratio of 26/74 at the end of FY 78, reflecting the GOB
financing pattern where EPC has financed its capital investment primarily
with debt (para 4.14). The debt/equity ratio shown is on the basis of assets
being recorded at historical cost; therefore, with the assets undervalued,
the debt/equity ratio is overstated. On the basis of revalued assets, the
debt/equity ratio would be about 30/70.

Financing Plan
4.19    A forecast of sources and applications of funds for the four- year
period FY 83-86 is shown in Annex 18. The assumptions used are outlined in
Annex 19 and include upward tariff adjustments and execution of the

substantial transfer of funds from EPC to GOB. This transfer consists of a
55% duty/tax on imported goods, and the previously mentioned (para 4.12)
payments to Government, consisting of a 10% tax on the unit sales of
electricity for other than industrial consumption and a 30% payment on net
income after the above mentioned 10% tax on sales and after interest.
Forecasts show that during the four years, FYs83-86, these payments would
amount to about K900   million, equivalent to 25% of EPC-s capital investment
during the same period. As noted, EPC also makes debt service payments to
GOB.
4.21   The amounts of funds shown in the financing plan are large in both
relative and absolute terms, and illustrate the characteristic capital
intensiveness of power infrastructure. During this four-year period, fund
requirements are expected to total K4,042 million (US$577 million equivalent,
including a foreign exchange requirement of US$316 million); total fund
requirements consist of an estimated capital investment of K3,970 million
(US$567 million) and an increase in working capital of K72 million (US$10
million).
4.22    Included as sources of funds are borrowings of K4,060 million (US$580
million), of which K1,850 million (US$264 million) are local funds to be lent
by Government and which form part of EPC's Government-approved capital
program. Also included in this figure is the K280 million shortfall in EPC-s
debt service during this four-year period. Of the remaining K2,210 million
(US$316 million) in foreign exchange, US$189 million has already been
arranged or is in the process of being arranged, leaving US$127 million,
still to be obtained.
4.23    The expansion program, which is designed to meet the country s  power
requirements, was agreed with the mission, EPC and the Ministry of Industry
II. The proposed project is designed to meet the need of providing for the
transmission of power from generation facilities already established or which
will be commissoned during the four-year period, FY83-86, and would not be
affected were there delays in that part of EPCGs program for which foreign
exchange is still not yet arranged.
4.24    The proposed project, estimated to cost K927.5 million (US$132.5
million equivalent, including a foreign exchange component of US$80 million),
represents 23% of EPC-s total capital program during this four-year period.
The IDA credit would provide all of the project's foreign exchange
requirement.
4.25    The on-lending terms from GOB to EPC for the proposed IDA credit
would be 8 1/2% annual interest rate and a term of 25 years, including a
5-year grace period. The Government would bear the foreign exchange risk.

The terms for government kyat loans used for capital investment are 5% for 10
years, including 5 years of grace. 1/
Future Finances
4.26    Forecast income statements, balance sheets and sources and
applications of funds statements for FYs 82-88 are shown in Annex 16, 17 and
18, respectively; notes and assumptions are in Annex 19. A summary of
forecast operating results for the seven-year period is as follows:

4.27    Revenue projections are based on increases in generation of
electricity, tariff increases and a gradual reduction in system losses.
Operating expenses are forecast based on system expansion and planned thermal
generation. Depreciation is taken at a 3% composite rate, which is
realistic. This seven-year forecast shows operating revenues and expenses
increasing at an average annual rate of about 23% and 15%, respectively. The
number of kWhs generated during this period is shown to increase by 66% and
kWhs sold to increase by 94%, reflecting a decrease in system losses. This
improvement together with a series of tariff increases would double the
average revenue/kWh by FY88, enabling EPC to completely cover its debt
service in that year, which would satisfy the earnings covenant. The rate of
return that would be earned on revalued assets would increase from a negative
.4% in FY 82 to 7.2% in FY 88.
1/   During the four year period 1976-1980, the average annual increase in
the Consumer Price Index in Burma was 1%. However, recent trends indicate a
rising level of inflation. The projections in this report use an inflation
rate ranging between 6% and 9% for both local costs and foreign costs and are
considered realistic. The current interest rate for government loans for
working capital and investment purposes are 8% and 5%, respectively, reflect-
ing GOB's dedication to maintenance of constant price levels.



-33-
4.28    Forecast balance sheets (Annex 17) show EPC's financial position at
the end of each year, FY 82 through FY 88. The balance sheets reflect the
substantial growth expected in gross fixed assets, including work
in-progress, from K2,590 million in FY 82 to K8,591 million in FY 88. In
financing this expansion according to GOB procedures, long-term debt is
expected to increase by K5,108 million (4.7 times), resulting in the
debt/equity ratio increasing from 56/44 in FY81 to 83/17 in FY88.

V.     JUSTIFICATION
Least Cost Solution
5.01    In order to ascertain that the proposed project represents the least
cost solution to satisfy demand, a comparison of alternatives has been made
in two steps: firstly, five alternative generation and associated primary
transmission and substation development programs are compared, including
EPC-s total program which encompasses the proposed project; and secondly,
three alternative primary transmission and substation programs with different
routes and voltages are compared, including the proposed transmission
project.
Comparison of Alternatives
5.02    In formulating the proposed transmission project, the consulting
engineers (Norconsult) have carried out studies taking into account existing
system facilities, those under construction and those in the planning stage.
Regarding the latter, the consultants together with EPC have selected
Paunglaung as the next major hydro generation project to be undertaken (and
for which a detailed engineering and design study is presently being carried
out - para 1.10). It is the only proposed hydro power project at an advanced
stage of investigation. Nevertheless, an economic comparison has been made
examining alternative investment programs which would defer hydro projects
and replace them with thermal generation. Where Paunglaung (136 MW) is
deferred, thermal plants of 140 MW have been considered. Where both
Paunglaung (136 MW) and Baluchang I (28 MW) with increased capacity at
Lawpita (33 MW) are deferred, thermal plants of 210 MW have been considered.
Different transmission configurations suitable for each alternative have been
identified.
5.03    Since the thermal alternatives would substitute for planned hydro,
which are to be operated as base load plants operating at annual plant
factors varying from 60% - 80% (see Table 2 of Annex 21), low speed diesel
engines and coal fired steam thermal plants were chosen as feasible thermal
alternatives. The location of thermal plant is assumed to be at Rangoon,
the main load center of the country. Various other assumptions made for
economic comparison are detailed in Annex 20.
5.04    Five generation and primary transmission development programs were
compared as noted in Annex 20. These five generation and primary transmission
development programs, including associated primary substations, each
providing equivalent generating output and a primary transmission system to
satisfy the forecast demand until 1992,were compared by calculating the
present value (PV) of cost streams over a range of discount rates. Capital
costs of various components are given in Table 1 of Annex 21; the energy
balance calculations for computing fuel costs are given in Table 2. Cost
streams consisting of capital investment, replacement costs, operation and



-3 5-
maintenance costs and system fuel costs, developed for the 35 year project
life and expressed in economic prices by converting local costs to border
prices at 1981 price level, are given in Table 3 of Annex 21. It was found
that the proposed program, including the project, would be the least cost
program at discount rates of 17% or below (see Table 4 of Annex 21).
5.05    Thermal alternatives, using gas fuel, to be located at major gas
fields were not considered for two reasons: (i) known proven reserves might
be consumed before the economic life of the existing and committed gas
consuming facilities (para 1.06) were exhausted; and (ii) even if the gas
fired thermal plant, including additions of steam boilers and turbine
generators to the existing and committed gas fired gas turbines were
developed to substitute for the planned hydro projects, the proposed
transmission project with its configuration would be adequate to distribute
the power generated and would still be the least cost transmission system
(see IBRD Map 14546).
5.06    As the next step, alternative primary transmission programs with
different routes and voltages, were compared with the proposed program. For
these alternatives, it was assumed that the generation sources would be as
assumed for the project, i.e. that Paunglaung would be the next hydro power
project to be undertaken. Three alternatives were considered as noted in
Annex 20. Capital and 0&M cost streams for the alternatives are shown in
Table 5 of Annex 21. It was found that the proposed transmission project
would be the least cost development program at discount rates below 24.0%
(see Table 4).
5.07    Sensitivity analyses were also conducted to assess the impact of
variations in various costs, as shown below, by indicating discount rates
which equalize PV of cost streams for the proposed program and for the next
least cost alternative.
Generation plus Primary Transmission         Equalizing Discount Rate
Base case                                              17.2%
Capital costs increased 10%                            16.3%
Fuel cost increased 10%                                18.2%
Capital cost reduced 10%                               18.3%
Fuel cost reduced 10%                                  16.1%
The above results demonstrate that the project represents the least cost
solution available to satisfy load demands within a range of discount rates,
including the estimated opportunity cost of capital of 12%.



-36-
System Benefits of the Project
5.08    The hydro generating facilities of EPC, which are in existence or
which are under construction, are located in the hydro grid system. (paras
1.11 and 1.12). Were the proposed transmission project not constructed to
interconnect the hydro system with the isolated thermal systems of Mann and
Prome-Myanaung- Myaungwye, substantial hydro energy would remain unutilized.
5.09    The present thermal systems of Mann and Prome-Myanaung-Myaungmya have
excess capacity. If the proposed project were not built, the hydro grid
system would run short of capacity in FY88 instead of FY90 on the assumption
that the proposed project would be built (Table 4 of Annex 5).
5.10    The proposed project would increase the reliability of supply to
Rangoon as there would be two 230 kV lines on different routes instead of the
present single line. It would also provide sufficient transmission capacity
for the next major hydro electric project (Paunglaung). The present 33 kV
distribution system of Rangoon which is overloaded in certain sections would
be relieved of overloading to some extent as the input to the system would be
from two 230 kV substations (Hlawga and Thaketa) instead of the present
single substation at Hlawga. This would improve the voltage conditions and
some reduction in distribution losses would also result.
Benefit/Cost Analysis
5.11    Quantification of the above benefits is not easily established.  An
approach, therefore, was taken to justify the entire power investment program
for the period FYs82 to 87. (For assumptions refer to Annex 20.)
5.12    Minimum benefits of power supply are the observed revenue paid by
consumers at prevailing tariffs. In order to identify some consumers surplus
beyond the tariff level, which, particularly in the case of industrial
consumers, is not representative of willingness to pay, the economic cost of
using alternative energy sources in the absence of electricity was estimated.
This represents a maximum valuation of power supply applicable only to a
portion of the consumption. For the remaining consumption, the value of
power supply was assumed to decline from the above mentioned higher value to
the tariff level (Table 1 of Annex 22). It is assumed that 13% of domestic
and commercial consumption and 26% of industrial consumption could be
justifiably valued at a higher price: in the case of domestic and commercial
consumption, the above percentage represents the minimum lighting
requirement; in case of industrial consumption, the percentage represents
the amount of energy which the consumers would generate through their own
diesel generation in the absence of electricity. Without electricity,
household and commercial establishments would use kerosine for their minimum
lighting requirement. Energy balance calculations required for the analysis
are given in Table 2 of Annex 22.
5.13    Calculations were made for five cases of estimated benefits.



-37-
Case I    The benefits are calculated on the prevailing tariffs,
yielding an TERR of -11.45%.
Case II   It is assumed that a 25% tariff increase would take place
in FY84, FY86, and FY88 in order for EPC to meet the
earnings covenant discussed in para 4.10 of the SAR. The
benefits are calculated based on the tariff increase in
real terms. This case yields an IERR of -4.15%.
Case III It is assumed that a certain percentage of consumption
representing a proven minimum use of alternative energy
sources would be valued by the consumers at the level of
the cost of the alternative, and the value of the remaining
consumption would be at the proposed tariff (para 5.12).
This case yields an IERR of 7.6%.
Case IV   The benefits are calculated by assuming that the value of
the remaining consumption would uniformly decline from the
high value to the existing tariff. This case yields an
IERR of 17.55%.
Case V   Consumers  surplus is again taken into consideration but
instead of the existing tariff, the proposed tariff with
25% increases in FY84, FY86, and FY88 is considered as
lower limit. The value of the remaining consumption is
assumed to decline uniformly from the high value to the
proposed tariff. The proposed structure of tariffs in
FYs84, 86, and 88 is not known at present. For calculation
purposes, it is assumed that tariffs for all categories of
consumers would be revised proportionately by 25%. This
case yields an IERR of 18.45%.
5.14    All costs are expressed in 1981 CIF or border terms. In Cases I and
IV, it is assumed that the existing tariffs would be maintained in real
terms. In Cases II, III and V, only the real increase in the tariff is taken
into consideration while calculating the benefits.
5.15    The economic rate of return for Case III is 7.6%.  Sensitivity
analyses on this case were made with the following results: 10% cost
increase, 6.25%; 10% cost decrease, 9.27% (Table I of Annex 22).
5.16    The true economic rate of return is expected to be significantly
higher than the above values, if benefits that could be quantified only with
difficulty, such as the full willingness of consumers to pay and additional
output made possible, would be included in the calculation. Similarly, the
benefit measurement is biased downward by the use of the abnormally low
industrial tariff as a component of the benefit.

VI.    AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01    During negotiations, the following issues were raised with the
Government and EPC and satisfactory agreement or assurances were obtained
with regard to:
(i)     EPC creating a system loss reduction unit and,
with assistance from outside specialists, establishing
a program for reducing losses to a more normal
level (para 1.21);
(ii)    EPC developing an effective planning unit (paras 2.07
and 2.08);
(iii)   filling vacant senior EPC finance posts not later than
March 31, 1983 (para. 2.10);
(iv)    EPC providing unaudited financial statements within
nine months of the end of the fiscal year and
certified copies of its audited financial statements
together with the auditor-s report within twelve
months of the end of the fiscal year (para 2.13);
(v)     EPC establishing a system for recording and
accounting for fixed assets by not later than
March 1, 1984 (para. 2.15);
(vi)    revaluation of assets (para 2.16);
(vii)   completion of associated transmission facilities (para. 3.08);
(viii)  EPC arranging to provide load dispatch facilities for
part of the system not included in the Project (para 3.10);
(ix)    restructuring EPC's tariffs (para 4.05);
(x)     an earnings covenant requiring a phased program
of tariff increases that would enable sufficient
revenues for EPC to cover its debt service by FY 88
(para 4.10).
6.03    Effectiveness of the credit is conditional on the conclusion of an
acceptable onlending agreement between GOB and EPC (para. 4.25);
6.04    With the above agreements, the Project forms a suitable basis for
an IDA Credit of US$80 million equivalent.

Electric Power Corporation (EPC)
Power Project
A Program to Strengthen EPC's Accounting
System and Practices
EPC recognizes the need for correcting certain weaknesses in its
accounting system and practices and for updating its antiquated punch card
system by a more modern data processing system. A recent ADB loan is
providing assistance in this endeavor and EPC is taking the following
action to strengthen the areas of stores accounting, billing and
collection and internal audit:
A. Stores Accounting, and Billing and Collection
(i) replacing the existing antiquated punch card
system by a modern data processing system
(financed by ADB);
(ii) augmenting billing/collection staff;
(iii) increasing consumer deposits to provide greater
security for the coverage of overdue receivables;
and
(iv) establishing more collection centers for the
convenience of consumers.
B. Internal Audit
(i) augmenting the audit department with qualified,
experienced staff and providing additional
training;
(ii) decentralizing the audit department by establishing
branch audit offices in selected district offices
for more efficient audit operations; and
(iii)  placing greater emphasis on the verification of
the existence of adequate internal check procedures,
adhering to prescribed accounting and financial
control systems, identifying weaknesses in these
systems and correcting them.

POWER PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
General
1.      The proposed project will consist of approximately 414 km of 230 kV
single circuit line and 229 km of 132 kV single circuit line. Two entirely
new 230 kV substations will be constructed at Thaketa and Taungdwingyi.
Extensions will be made at the 230 kV Hlawga substation, 230 kV Prome
powerstation, 66 kV Prome substation, 132 kV Mann power station and 132 kV
Chauk substation. About 30 km from Magwe, a junction point (JCT) will be
created to connect three 132 kV transmission lines through disconnect
switches (Mann to JCT, Chauk to JCT and Taungdwingyi to JCT). Later on, this
JCT could be developed into a regular substation to feed loads around Magwe.
Transmission Lines
2.      Detailed stability, load flow, and short circuit studies have been
carried out by the consulting engineer to dimension the project components.
Two ACSR conductors per phase not smaller than 605 MCM are required for the
230 kV lines in order to maintain stability under single phase to ground
faults followed by unsuccessful reclosing. The main features of the

3.      All towers will be self-supporting and will be of galvanized steel.
There will be two earthwires of 50 sq. mm. dimension.
In order to regulate the voltage profile, it will be necessary to
compensate the transmission line by installing two static reactor units of 10
MVAR, 11 kV at Prome and another one at Taungdwingyi.
Substations
4.      The power transformer at Taungdwingyi will be an auto-type
transformer and will interconnect the 230 kV and 132 kV systems. It will be
fitted with an off-load tap changer. The new transformers at Thaketa, Prome,
and Mann will directly supply loads and will be fitted with on-load tap
changers. The transformers at Thaketa will be single phase units and of
132.8/38.1-19.05/11 kV voltage rating with star/star/delta winding
connections. Initially, 33 kV winding will be used, and the load demand of
Rangoon will be met through the Thaketa sustation and the new 33 kV lines
from Thaketa to Pathein-NTyaunt, Thingangyun, MOC and Syriam substations and
through the existing 33 kV network fed from the existing 230 kV Hlawga
substation (refer IBRD Map 16002) and para. 308). This arrangement should
satisfy the load requirements of Rangoon for a number of years since the
Rangoon 33 kV distribution system will be fed through two 230 kV substations,
i.e. Thaketa and Hlawga. Later on when EPC has finalized its plans to change
the Rangoon subtransmission voltage from 33 kV to 66 kV, the transformer
connections at Thaketa will be changed to 66 kV.
Like Thaketa, power transformers at other locations will be single
phase units with one unit being kept as a spare. For the 230 kV line
breakers, a single pole reclosing feature will be provided. The presently
installed 230 kV breaker at Hlawga on Hlawga-Taungoo line is not suitable
for single pole reclosing. A suitable new breaker will be provided and old
breakers will be used at a place where single pole reclosing is not required.
132 kV breakers will not be provided at the JCT. These could be provided
later when JCT is developed into a regular substation. Appropriate three
terminal line protection will be provided for the 132 kV
Mann-Chauk-Taungdwingyi section. Line protection on the 230 kV network will
be distance carrier, non-switched type. Because of the meshed nature of the
132 kV network, line protection will be of a distance carrier type. To
facilitate quick identification of line faults, fault localizers with
disturbance recorders will be installed at appropriate locations.
5.      The main features of the substations are tabulated below:

6.      It will be necessary to supply additional reactive power to the loads.
It is proposed to install about 72 MVAR static capacitors at 33 kV, or 11 kV,
or 6.6 kV buses at various substations. These capacitors would
reduce distribution losses.
Load Dispatching Center
7.      Provision has been made in the project for a simple load dispatching
center. At present, EPC has a power line carrier system for speech
alone. There is no transmission of telemetering, teleindication or telecontrol
signals. All metering and control is done locally at various power stations
and substations and the necessary information is transmitted to Rangoon by
telephone. EPC wishes to make a start in setting up a proper load dispatching
center. It is proposed to establish it at EPC Headquarters (Rangoon) where space
has already been allocated for this purpose. Provision has been made in the
project for the following facilities:
A. Telemetering
a. Maximum demand (MW and MVAR) from various substations
and powerstations with summation of the total demand
(MW) of the grid system;
b. Hourly production and consumption (kWh) from each
powerstation and substation;
c. Instantaneous loading of important lines (MW and MVAR);
d. Voltage (kV) at selcted bus bars;
e. Frequency of selected bus bars.
B. Teleindication
Indication (closed/open) of selected circuit breakers and switches
will be presented to the operators with suitable instruments and indicators
mounted on a one line diagram board.
8.      The project includes the cost (foreign portion) of providing the
above facilities, cost of one radio link between the load dispatching center
and Hlawga and training of two operators of EPC abroad for two months.
9.      Only the essential power stations and substations are covered in the
project. EPC will coordinate and will provide similar facilities for the
remaining substations and power stations in the grid system so that complete

information is available in the load dispatching center. EPC will derive
the following benefits from the above center:
1. Prompt action during system disturbance;
2. Long term and daily planning of loading of various
hydro and thermal powerstations, management of spinning
and standby reserve;
3. Prompt voltage and reactive power adjustments;
4. Identification of losses in various components of the
transmission system;
5. Ability to keep line loadings within defined limits;
6. Proper statistical data of generation and consumption.
7. Frequency and time deviation control.

Project Implementation
Transmission Lines
1.      EPC will erect the transmission lines by using its own staff
supplemented by temporary personnel and small contractors. Line material
and line construction equipment will be procured through international
competitive bidding. On arrival of the material, EPC will fist store it in
the warehouses, then transport it to the site, and finally use it to erect
the lines. The first section of the 230 kV Prome-Hlawga line will be used
for training the cadre of EPC in new techniques of line construction (tension
stringing, erection of towers with hydraulic winches, etc.). EPC has
considerable experience in line construction using manual labor and has
recently constructed 192 km of the 132 kV Kyunchaung Monywa transmission line
in nine months. The training, which will last for about six months, will be
sufficient to enable EPC to complete the remaining transmission lines of the
project independently, using new equipment and methods. The training will
be given by about twenty-five expatriates of the construction contractor.
2.      For execution of this work, EPC will set up two groups with each
group consisting of:
-Three teams for foundation work;
-Three teams for erection work;
-One team for stringing work.

Against the requirement of 200 skilled laborers, EPC has tentatively
allocated 140 for the project. The shortfall will be met by promoting
experienced semi-skilled labor to skilled category. Whenever required, EPC
recruits unskilled labor on a temporary basis and terminates their service on
the completion of work. Even some of the skilled labor and sub-assistant
engineers are engaged on a temporary basis. EPC can, therefore, trim its
staff requirements according to its needs.
3.      EPC intends to construct the following warehouses, open sheds and
permanent camps along the line route in order to store the material and to
accommodate some of its permanent staff. After construction, these camps
will be retained by EPC for patrolling and maintaining the lines.

4.      Provision has been made in the project for new construction equipment
to enable both of the groups to work simultaneously.
Substations
5.      The civil works portion of the construction of substations will also
be done by EPC, using its own staff. These civil works include:
-Earth work in the substation;
-Substation control room building;
-Equipment foundations;
-Roads, drains, cable-trenches within the substation;
-Fencing and gravelling of the switchyard;



ANNEX 12

-Residential buildings within the substation, including
services (water supply, sanitation, and sewerage).
6.      EPC has the necessary work force (Sub-assistant engineers, foremen,
carpenters, masons, and blacksmiths) to do this type of civil work. However,
if necessary, EPC will recruit additional staff on a temporary basis.
Provision has been made in the project for new construction equipment
required to execute these works.
After completion of the civil works, the erection of substation
equipment, site testing and final commissioning of substations will be
supervised by the respective contractors who originally supplied the
equipment.

Notes and Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
INCOME STATEMENTS
Sale of Electricity
Sales forecasts of electricity are based on projected plant expansion
and takes into account a reduction in system losses. Sales are forecast to
increase at an average annual rate of 10% through FY88.
Average Revenue per kWh Sold
The average revenue per kWh sold reflects a series of three tariff
increases of 25% each becoming effective at the beginning of FYs 84, 86 and
88.
Other Income
Other income includes interest, sale of scrap and rental of office
space, and is shown to increase by 10% annually.
Fuel Cost
The cost of fuel has been forecast on the basis of existing fuel
prices and planned thermal generation in each of the forecast years.
Operations and Maintenance
Forecasts of operating and maintenance expenses are based on the
system's growth and provide for an average annual increase of about 13%.
Depreciation
EPC is applying a composite rate of depreciation of 3%. This rate is
acceptable and has been used for the forecasts.



ANNEX 19
Page 2 of 2 pages
-73-
Payments to Government
Payments to Government consist of (i) a commodity and service tax of
10% on electricity sales (excluding industrial consumption), and (ii) a
payment to the Government equivalent to 30% of EPC's net income after
interest and after the 10% commodity and service tax.
Balance Sheets
Cash
Cash balances are projected on the basis of six to eight weeks cash
operating expenses.
Inventories
Inventories are forecast as a percentage of fixed assets in
operation, and are shown to be 5% in the early years of the forecast
decreasing to 4% in the latter years as improvements are made in materials
management.
Accounts Receivable
Forecasts assume that the amount of accounts receivables would
decline from about a three months' annual billing level to about a month's
level as a result of steps being taken to improve billing and collection
procedures.
Other Current Assets
Other current assets include advances paid and services rendered to
individuals and entities, and customs and freight deposits. An annual 10%
increase is assumed for the forecast.
Fixed Assets
The amount of fixed assets is calculated based on the EPC's
construction program and its timing of execution.
Current Liabilities
Current liabilities include accounts payable and consumers' deposits.
Accounts payable are forecast on the basis of six months cash operating
expense and consumers' deposits on the basis of new connections.
Price Escalation
Annual inflation factors ranging between 6% and 9% have been allowed
for local and foreign costs.

Economic Analysis
Method
1.      Quantification of benefits arising from the implementation of the
proposed transmission project, which is to integrate the present power sys-
tems into the existing grid system as well as to accommodate transmission
of outputs of future generating plants to transmit to the load centers, is
not easily established. Therefore, an approach was taken to first ascertain
that the project would represent the least cost solution and then to justify
the entire investment program through calculating the IERR, thus allowing
the conclusion that the project, which is an integral part of the program, is
implicitly justified.
2.      Assumptions

6.      Cost streams have been developed for the proposed program and alter-
natives including initial capital costs, operation and maintenance costs,
fuel costs and replacement costs for the 35 year project life. The capital
cost of each component of the alternatives are shown in Table 1 of Annex 21.
Energy balances for alternatives required to estimate the fuel costs are
shown in Table 2, and cash flows for the total development program as well as
for the primary transmission programs are shown in Tables 3 and 5 of Annex
21, respectively.
7.      Present values of cash flows are computed over a range of discount
rates. Sensitivity analyses have also been conducted to assess the impact of
variation in cost. The results are shown in Table 4 of Annex 21. It was
found that out of the five generation and primary transmission programs, the

proposed program including the project would be the least cost program at
discount rate of 17% or below. It was also found that out of the three
primary transmission programs, the proposed transmission project would be the
least cost program at discount rate of 24.0% or below.
Cost/Benefit Analysis
Economic Benefits
8.      Benefits of electricity for domestic and commercial use, which accrue
to final consumers are assessed as the willingness to pay for a needed quan-
tity of energy for specific purposes. Assessment of this willingness to pay
is based on (i) tariff revenues, and (ii) observed expenditures on alterna-
tive energy sources in the absence of electricity to identify some of the
consumers' surplus.
9.      A major part of industrial electricity consumption in Burma is by
government-owned corporations, for which an assessment of willingness to pay
for electricity is difficult. The tariff is in effect an internal transfer
price. Therefore, benefits of electricity for industrial use are assessed as
the additional benefit to the economy for a needed quantity of energy for
specific purposes. This additional benefit is based on (i) tariff revenues
as a lower limit of benefits, and (ii) observed additional expenditures on
alternative energy sources in the absence of electricity. Five different
cases have been considered (Para. 5.13). Cases I and II take into account
the benefits based on tariff revenues alone whereas in Cases III, IV and V,
some consumer surplus has been identified.
Domestic Consumption
10.     In the absence of electricity supply, domestic consumers would use
kerosine lamps as an alternative source for lighting.  However, consumption
would be limited to minimum lighting because of the high kerosine price in
the free market. The electricity consumption on this assumption is estimated
at only about 13% of the present domestic electricity consumption, assuming
60 watts for three hours per day per consumer. This consumption (13%) is
valued at the economic cost of kyats 3.9 p   kWh (see para. 11 below).  The
remaining consumption (87%) is assumed to be valued as follows: Case III,
using proposed tariff; Case IV, using a declining value from K3.9/kWh to the
existing tariff; Case V, using a declining value from K3.9/kWh to the
proposed tariff (Para. 5.13).
11.     The cost of kerosine lighting is estimated as follows, assuming a
lamp with a light output of 60w equivalent:

Fuel Costs (0.05 litre hr.        kyats 3.558/kWh
at kyats 4.27/ litre) 1/
Total Cost                        kyats 3.895/kWh
say kyats 3.9/kWh
Commercial Consumption
12.     Similarly as in estimating economic benefits of domestic consumption,
13% of commercial consumption is valued at kyats 3.9 per kWh, assuming that
this portion would be substituted by kerosine lamp lighting in the absence of
electricity. The remainder is assumed to be valued similarly to that indi-
cated for Domestic Consumption (para. 10).
Industrial Consumption
13.     For industrial consumers, the alternative to electricity supply from
EPC is to provide its generating units, mostly diesel engines. In the past,
captive generation has been about 26% of industrial consumption, including
that supplied from EPC. Therefore, it is assumed that 26% of industrial
consumption would be generated through the captive plant in the absence of
electricity for EPC. This portion is valued at kyats 0.830 per kWh as shown
below:
Captive Diesel Plant
Capital Cost                      kyats 1617 per kW
Annuitized Cost (12%              kyats 0.054 per kWh
discount rate, 20 years

annum)

Fuel Costs (US$50.3 per           kyats 0.778 per kWh
barrel, heat rate 3150
kcal/kWh)
Total Cost                        kyats 0.830 per kWh
1/ Based on free market price.



ANNEX 20

The remainder is assumed to be valued as follows: Case III, using proposed
tariff; Case IV, using a declining value, from KO.83/kWh to the existing
tariff; Case V, using a declining value, from KO.83/kWh to the proposed
tariff (Para. 5.13).
Cost/Benefit Analysis
14.     The economic cost of EPC's least cost investment program, covering
the years FY 82 to FY 87, is compared with the benefits arising from
incremental sales. Calculations were made for five cases (para 5.13). Sen-
sitivity analyses were also made using a 10% increase and a 10% decrease of
the cost stream. The results are shown in Table 1 of Annex 22, demonstrating
that the economic rate of return is estimated to be about 8%. 1/ The results
clearly show that the tariff levels
are very low resulting in negative internal rate of return, when benefits are
measured by the tariff revenue alone.
1/ This is the minimum economic rate of return based on limited identifica-
tion of consumers' surplus. Identification of a greater proportion of con-
sumers surplus yields an economic rate of return of about 18%.
