POWER PROJECT (CREDIT 1245-BA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPQRT
,Preface
This is the Proje4t Completion Report (PCR) for the Power Project in
Myanmar, for m-hich Credit 1245-BA in the amount of Special Drawing Pights
(SDR) 70.1 million (about US$80.0 million equivalent at the time of approval)
was approved on May 13, 1982. The Credit was closed on April 30, 1991 four
years behind schedule. With the final disbursement of US$18,783.80 on
September 23, 1991, the total amount disbursed was SDR 69,794,001.30
equivalent to US$82,018,495 at the corresponding rate of exchange at the time
of disbursements. The undisbursed balance of SDR 315,998.3 equivalent to
US$429,253 was cancelled on October 2, 1991.
The PCR was prepared by the Industry and Energy Operations Division,
Department II of the Asia Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary,
Parts I and III). The Beneficiary of the Credit, Myanma Electric Power
Enterprise (MEPE),1 prepared Part II of the Report.
Preparation of this report started in November 1990 with work on a
preliminary draft which could be completed when missing data and other input
from MEPE was acquired and when the final disbursement was made. The report
is based on the Staff Appraisal Report, Credit Agreement, supervision reports
and input from HEPE.
I    The entity's current name will be used throughout this report.

POWER PROJECT (CREDIT 1245 BA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Obi2ctivel
1.        The project's objectives were (i) to lay the groundwork for a
comprehensive and integrated approach to the future development of MEPE's
transmission system; (ii) to bring about a much needed improvement in system
efficiency; and (iii) to address important issues relating to MEPE's
operations and the Government's policies in the power sector, (Part I, para
3.1).
Implementation Exoerience
2.        The project was well planned and organized; it proceeded smoothly
except for some interruptions mainly due to delays in Government approval of
procurement documents. The quality of construction and rate of progress were
satisfactory and justified the use of force account. All of the project's
original physical components were completed in 1987, about a year later than
the April 30, 1987 target date. Substantial delays were met, however, in
implementing the institutional development components and the components added
to the project to make it possible for MEPE to utilize surplus funds due to a
US$31.6 million project cost underrun. The expanded project was eventually
completed in early 1991 and final disbursements were made five months after
the April 30, 1991 Credit closing date, the fourth extension from the original
April 30, 1987 closing date, (Part I, para. 5.1 to 5.3).
Results
3.        Although later than planned, all major objectives were echieved.
The backbone of an interconnected national grid was strengtheed with the
addition of transmission lines and substations; a load dispatch center was
installed and is functioning satisfactorily; and a modest start has been made
in reducing system losses. Training arrangements have not been entirely
satisfactory, but MEPE's planning capacity has benefitted from a UNDP training
program. Also, a UNDP sector study is reassessing Myanmar's future power
investment requirementc, including hydroelectric schemes which were to be
studied under the project. MEPE's financial position remains weak although a
50 percent average tariff increase in November 1988 has made it possible to
comply with the Credit Agreement debt service covenant. MEPE is required to
revalue its assets on completion of a study of its fixed asset accounting
system, (Part I, paras. 6.1 to 6.4).



- lii -
Sustai nability
4.        The benefits provided from the physical project components should be
sustainable over the foreseeable future. MEPE has a reasonable record of
successfully operating and maintaining its facilities. Therefore, the
strengthening of transmission system, rehabil'tation of several generation
facilities, and upgrading of distribution networks will enhance the overall
supply of power to the consumers. However, with regard to the institutional
components, the benefits are less obvious and their sustainability
questionable. Improvement in planning and the 1988 tariff increase has had a
beneficial impact on the utility but the lack of commitment from the
government in terms of sound management, financial practices, and distortion
in economic incentives is not encouraging MEPE to become an efficient
enterprise.
Findings and Lessons Learned
5.        The project illustrates that, in times of abrupt and extreme
exchange variations between currencies, project cost can give rise to
implementation and disbursement problems as well as the possibility of
financing subprojects not making optimum use of the surplus funds. Therefore,
care must be taken to ensure that cost estimates are realistic and that
contingency allowances are not excessive. Where a sizeable cost underrun does
occur, IDA should make an assessment to determine whether it is in the best
interest of the Borrower to reallocate the exce'ss funds or whether all or a
portion should be canceled. In this particular case, funds available gave the
opportunity to implement a pilot distribution schtLie in Yangon in order to
reduce losses which was a major scope and objective of the project, (Part I,
para. 5.4)
6.        Although other factors were responsible, the main causes of project
delays appear to have been bureaucratic in nature. It is important to
minimize such delays. At the next lending operation, the Association should
(i) make the Borrower cognizant of the heavy economic cost in delayed benefits
paid for such delays; (ii) reach agreement on specific steps to be taken to
minimize the time taken for Government reviews and clearances; and (iii) agree
on steps to be taken to improve MEPE's procurement performance to a
satisfactory level, (Part I, para. 5.3)

2. Backround
2.1         Prior to 1951 electricity was supplied throughout Hyanmar by
several independent private companies. In 1951 the Government nationalized
these companies and incorporated them into the Electricity Supply Board (ESB)
which it had established for this purpose. Following the reorganization of
the nationalized industries in 1972, ESB was replaced by the newly formed
Electric Power Corporation (EPC) which became the state entity responsible for
the construction, operation and maintenance of electric power facilities
throughout Myanmar. At that time, the Ministry of Industry No. 2 was given
jurisdiction over EPC along with petroleum and heavy industry enterprises.
Because of the significance of the energy sector in the development of the
country's economy, the government decided to create in April 1985 a new
ministry, the Ministry of Energy, comprising the following corporations which
were previously under the Ministry of Industry No. 2: (i) Electric Power
Corporation; (ii) Myanma Oil Corporation; (iii) Petrochemical Industries
Corporation; and (iv) Petroleum Products Supply Corporation. The heavy
industries remained under the Ministry of Industry No.2. On April 1, 1989,
EPC was reorganized as the Myanma Electric Power Enterprise (MEPE, which will
be used throughout this report), together with the three petroleum enterprises
following the economic policy changes in 1988. These changes led to some
decentralization in the management of state enterprises along with increase
financial responsibility and autonomy.
2.2         MEPE prepared the project based on the results of comprehensive
system studies by a Norwegian consulting firm. The Association appraised the
project during June and July in 1981. A major concern at the time was MEPE's
deteriorating operating results which threatened its ability to service its
debts and to finance essential capital projects. The root cause of MEPE's
financial difficulties was the Government's policy of keeping industrial
electricity tariffs low with the aim of encouraging industrialization with
cheap electric power. In addition, extraordinarily high system losses (32Z)
were further exacerbating MEPE's financial problems.



-2-
2.3         The project was the Bank Group's first direct involvement in
Myanmar's electric power subsector. However, the Association had gained some
indirect exposure to the subsector through its participation in the Kinda Dam
Multipurpose Project (Credit 1031-BA), which included a hydroelectricity
generation component, financed by Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) of the
Federal Republic of Germany, and its role of Executive Agency for the UNDP-
financed power development survey completed in July 1978.
3. Proiect Objectives and Descgiption
3.1         The project was designed to provide essential transmission
facilities for the generating stations already in operation and for those
still wuder construction at the time of project preparat.ln.  The objective
was to: (i) lay the groundwork for a comprehensive and integrated approach to
the future development of MEPE's transmission system; and (ii) bring about a
much needed improvement in system efficiency. Also included in the project
were a wide range of institutional development goal3 related to MEPE's
operations and the Government's sector policies, namely: (i) the level and
structurL of electricity tariffs; and (ii) the strengtaening of MEPE's
planning capability, financial organization and operations.
3.2         The project comprised the following components:
(a)   Transmission lines:  installation of about 414 km of 230 kV and
229 km oi 132 kV single circuit transmission lines;
(b) Substations: construction and expansion of eight 230 kV, 132 kV
and 66 kV substations with an aggregate transformer capacity of
330 MVA.;
(c)   Installation of a load dispatch center and meter testing
equipment;
(d)   Consulting services for project management, system loss reduction,
fixed asset accounting system, and establishing a planning unit;
(e)   Preparation of a feasibility study of a suitable hydroelectric
project to follow the proposed Paunglaung multi-purpose project;
and
(f)   Training of MEPE staff.
4. roject Design arnd Organization
4.1         Project concept and design took account of the fact that the
project was the Bank Group's first direct lending operation in Mvanmar's
electric power subsector. Thorough staff appraisal analysis identified MEPE's
technical and institutional development needs and the sector policy issues to
be addressed with the Government. Satisfactory agreement was reached during
negotiations on the scope, content and objectives of the project. However,
the subsequent reluctance of the Government to comply with key covenants of
the Development Credit Agreement (mainly tariff level and structure)



illustrates the difficulty of resolving controversial macroeconomic policy
issues through a project lending operation, especially in the face of a
government's deep-soated social and political convictions. It would be
helpful to have such issues addressed at senior Bank and Government levels to
ensure that there is a basis for and no misunderstanding about the specific
agreements to be sought in a project loan or credit.
4.2         The project implementation structure was well organized and
staffed. Project management was assigned to an experienced and competent
NEPE's team backed up by expatriate engineering consultants in accordance with
the Association's recommendations. For the erection of transmission lines and
associated facilities included in the transmission project component, the
Association agreed to MEPE using its own staff which had the requisite
experience and capability from similar previous construction work. The
decision to use force account was in fact a rational choice considering that
there were no private contractors in Hyanmar and that no foreign contractor
would have been able to match MEPE staff's experience and familiarity with
local conditions.
5. Project Implementation
5.1         Part III, Section 4 compares planned and actual implementation
progress. The original Credit closing date was April 30, 1987 and the final
closing date April 30, 1991. The official project completion date (from the
Credit Agreement) was April 30, 1986.
5.2         Project implementation essentially consisted of two parts:  the
project as originally defined, and the components added to the project to make
it possible fer MEPE to utilize funds from a US$31.6 million project cost
underrun. Project implementation started on schedule and, in general,
proceeded satisfactorily. All original components were completed in July
1987, 15 months behind the anticipated completion date. Some delays were
experienced in the evaluation of tenders, due to participation of many
tenderers in the seven lots of equipment and materials procured for the
project, and also as a result of slow government contract approval.
Significant time saving could have been achieved in the evaluation of the
tenders by simply grouping the seven lots into two packages, namely
transmission line materials and substation equipment. On the other hand,
splitting of the equipment and materials into several lots has resulted in
substantial savings from the original scope of works. Further extension of
the Credit was arranged through several dis"ussions between the Association
and the Borrower cocerning the utilization of funds remaining available from
the main project scope. Construction progress fully justified the use of
force account.
5.3         The subcomponents added to the project (see Part III, Section 4)
greatly extended the implementation period. As a result, the total expanded
project has eventually been completed in early 1991 and the final disbursement
was made on September 23, 1991, almost five months after the April 30, 1991
Credit closing date, the fourth and final extension following the original
April 30, 1987 date. The lengthy delay in overall project completion can be
largely attributed to procurement problems. Procurement records show that for



7 of the 12 lots, procured through international competition bidding, it took
more than a year after bid opening (in one case over two years) to award a
contract. Other significant contributing factors were the disruptions during
the 1988 civil unrest, customs procedures, and delays by IDA in approving the
expenditure of surplus funds.
5.4          To an appreciable extent, the large project cost underrun appears
to be due to an overly cautious cost estimate - a time when inflation rates
were high all over the world.  The foreign e    .,ge contingency, for example,
was almost 50 percent of the base cost. It is prudent to be conservative in
estimating a project cost when the Borrower has to rely completely on an IDA
credit to fund the foreign exchange. On the other hand, as the project
illustrates, a large underrun can create serious implementation and
disbursement problems. The funding of subprojects may also not represent the
optimum use of the surplus funds. In these situations, the Association should
carefully weigh whether reallocation or cancellation best serve the Borrower's
interest.
6. Project Results
6.1         Project objectives were largely achieved.  The backbone of an
interconnected national grid was strengthened with the installation of 230 kV
transmission lines and the associated transformer capacity. The installation
of a load dispatch center greatly increased MEPE's capability to control and
monitor its operations from a central location. System losses, although still
high, were reduced from 30 percent of gross generation during FY82 to about
25 percent currently. Further improvement should be realized on completion of
the substation and distribution reinforcement being carried out in the Yangon
area under the expanded project. Training provisions were not completely
satisfactory. Training was mainly provided in conjunction with equipment
supply contracts instead of the coordinated program originally envisaged.
MEPE's planning capabilities are being strengthened with the help of an
ongoing UNDP program.
6.2         With regard to the hydroelectric feasibility study component of
the project, the proposed Bilin scheme, with a potential of 240 MW capacity,
was originally envisaged as the next hydroscheme to be developed. However,
three factors reoilted in eventually dropping that study component from the
project scope: '7j a joint World Bank/UNDP Energy Assessment undertaken in
June 1985 recormended that the development of gas based generation would be
the basis for future least cost development; (ii) bilateral assistance
proposal to undertake and finance studies for the future development of hydro
power did not materialize; and (iii) security uncertainties in the Bilin
region.  More recently, in 1990, an Energy Sector Policy and Investment
Review, in which the feasibility of develupment of hydroscheme is reassessed,
has been undertaken under UNDP financing and the Bank as Executing Agency.
6.3         MEPE's financial position remained weak throughout the project
cycle. Tables 6.1 and 6.2 in Part III and the Financial Statements in Annex 1
compare actual financial performance with project appraisal forecasts over the
FY82 to FY88 period. The cause of KEPE's financial plight is the fact that
there was no tariff increase between 1981 and 1988. An average 50 percent



increase introduced in November 1988 has made it possible for MEPE to comply
with the Credit Agreement self-financing covenant. A study of MEPE's fixed
asset accounting system being carried out under the project with the help of
consultants has not been completed. IDA has agreed that MEPE await completion
of this study before revaluing its assets in compliance with the Credit
Agreement.
6.4         Estimates of the Project's economic results are not easier to
establish now than at the time of project appraisal. First, the system
benefits of the project, including essentially reinforcement of tranmission
and distribution facilities, cannot be specifically identified. Therefore,
the approach taken, in both the SAR and PCR, is to justify the entire power
investment implemented for the period FY82 to FY90 and its incremental
bonefits for the period FY91 to FY2021. Second, and more importanly,
quantification of the benefits is not easily established as a result of major
economic distortion existing in the electricity tariff. In fact, in real
price terms, tariffs have decreased over the past ten years in spite of
nominal tariff hikes in 1984 and 1988. Therefore, when benefits are
calculated on the prevailing tariffs, and costs are expressed in border terms,
the results, translated in internal economic rate of return (IERR), are
negative. Only when considering either the full consumers' willingness or
estimated long run marginal cost of expanding generation, transmission and
distribution to meet the present demand, then the results become positive and
represent the true economic rate of return for the system benefits from the
Project. Section 6.D in Part III and Annex 2 provide details on the project
economic impact and IERR.
7.          Prolect Sustainabi-lity
7.1         The benefits provided from the physical project components should
be sustainable over the foreseeable futura. MEPE has a reasonable record of
successfully operate and maintain its fac'lities. Therefore, the
strengthening of transmission system, rehabilitation of several generation
facilities, and upgrading of distribution networks will enhance the overall
supply of power to customers. However, with regard to the institutinal
components, the benefits are less obvious and their sustainability
questionable. Improvement in planning and the 1988 tariff increase has had a
beneficial impact on the utility but the lack of commitment from the
Government in terms of sound management, financial practices, and distortion
in economic incentives is not encouraging NEPE to become an efficient
enterprise.
8. Association's Performance
8.1         For its first operation in the power sector in Myanmar, the Bank
Group played an important role in assisting the Government programs of
integrating the system and strengthening the sector. The Association's
insistence on institutional development was responsible for including in the
project the preparation of a loss reduction program, implementation of a pilot
distribution scheme, and also for developing the planning capability of MEPE.



- 6-
The Association has however been less successful in convincing the Government
and MEPE to implement training program in cooperation with foreign utilities.
8.2         A cooperative working relationship was maintained by Bank Group
staff with MEPE and government officials throughout the project cycle. Since
the project was the first with the borrower, it required close cooperation
during implementation in order to solve several problems, in particular during
the procuremont stage and at the time of readjusting the project scope as a
result of the project cost underrun. Twelve supervision missions were
required for effective supervision of the project and solving implementation
problems. The overall performance rating reached several times a low rate at
critical time of implementation. In spite of these difficulties the Bank
Group's performance in all aspects of the project can be rated as completely
satiafactory.
9. Borrower/Beneficiary's Performance
9.1         Making allowance for the inexperience of the Borrower to carry out
a Bank Group financed project, and the difficult political and economic
environment, MEPE was eventually able to implement the project according to
plan, within a reasonable schedule and budget, considering also the problems
raised by the cost underrun which was identified at a relatively early stage
i;f 7--ject execution.
9.2         MEPE's operating efficiency and productivity has benefitted from
the project, and this should continue to be the case with the implementation
of the pilot distribution project, the computerized billing system, and the
strengthening of planning capability. However, MEPE is still far from being
an efficient utility. MEPE must improve its operational and maintenance
activities, its commercial practices, and financial structure and discipline.
In this regard, a more positive approach with regard to training and
cooperation with efficient utilities would benefit MEPE. The results should
certainly outweigh the costs associated with training.
10. Project RelationshiR
10.1        In the course of this Bank Group's first lending operation in
Myanmar's electric power sector, Bank Group staff established very good
working relationship with sector entities including MEPE, especially with its
project team, and the government officials concerned with the sector. The
atmosphere of mutual respect and trust has made it possible to amicably settle
the various issues which arise during a lending operation, including such
sensitive issues as electricity tariffs - wherein rate increase was made a
condition for extension of the credit closing date - and financial
performance. The cooperation was particularly effective in redesigning the
project scope and to eventually disburse almost the full credit amount.
Unfortunately, the political and economic environment prevailing in the
country during the latest stages of project implementation has not made it
possible to extend the cooperation in the preparation of a future lending
operation.



-7-
10.2        Bank Group staff also maintained a good relationship with
consultants involved in the project implementation but also, in the context of
project supervision, with Norwegian consultants (financed under bilateral
assistance) which were responsible for the feasibility study and engineering
design of the 280 MW Paunglaung hydroscheme development. The scheme has been
considered as a potential candidate for additional power generation resources
requiring the Association's assistance for its implementation. As far as it
could be observed, MEPE remained on equally good terms with its consultants
and contractors.
11. Consulting Services
11.1        MEPE engaged consultants to carry out several aspects of the
project. Norcons1.lt, from Norway, assisted HEPE in all preparation and
implementation aspects of the project physical components. This assistance
provided to MEPE staff valuable on-the-job training in the implementation of a
large project. It contributed to the on-schedule completion of the major
project components. The British Electricity International (BEI), from the
United Kingdom, provided services to establish and partially implement a loss
reduction program. As a result of that study, and its recommendations, losses
have been reduced by about 5. In addition, MEPE with IDA's agreement,
implemented in Yangon area, a pilot distribution project and a computerized
billing system using funds still available in the Credit. These components
will also have a beneficial impact on losses reduction. With regard to
financial improvement, MEPE has developed with the assistance of Price
Waterhouse of Australia a fixed asset recording and accounting system, a basic
requirement for a power utility. However, the consultant's contract expired
before implementing the system with proper training of MEPE staff to operate
the system. As a result, the fixed asset recording has not yet been fully
installed. MEPE also failed to recruit consultants for improving its
technical and utility practices. MEPE invited and received proposals but
never signed a contract, preferring instead to use the funds for the purchase
of equipment. However, MEPE staff benefitted from training provided by the
different equipment suppliers. MEPE reports that all consultancy services
performed on the project were satisfactory except for some language
communication difficulties.
12.         Prolict Documentation and Data
12.1        The staff appraisal report was comprehensive and well prepared; it
gave a comprehensive account of the technical and institutional aspects of the
power sector in Myanmar at appraisal and the project's role in developing and
strengthening the sector. In particular, it precisely defined the project,
its objectives and execution, all of which were accurately reflected in the
Development Credit Agreement. However, the legal agreement provided
sufficient flexibility in the definition and scope of the project to allow the
expansion of eligible disbursements within the intent and objective of the
credit. This feature is important when the volume and scope of work required
for planned electrification targets, particularly for transmission and
distribution schemes, cannot be accurately gauged a'. the initial planning
stage and project preparation.



12.2        Both the Association supervision reports and the project quarterly
progress reports, most of them prepared by the consultants, were informative
and useful. They made it possible to identify the main issues in project
implementation particularly the cost underrun and the need for reallocation of
funds. They also repeatedly mention the weaknesses in the institution
building and the difficulty to remedy them.

POWER PROJECT (CREDIT 1245-BA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART Il. Project Review from the Borrower's Perspective
1. Project Background
1.1         The main objective of the Project was to improve the power supply
situation of the country, which previously had to rely on two radial
transmission systems, the Northern 132 kV Transmission System and the Southern
230 kV transmission system.
2.   Project Results and Lesson Learned
2.1         Creation of a National Grid.  The new transmission lines in the
Project formed a ring system with the existing lines thereby improving the
overall supply reliability allowing infeed from two directions. The Project
also enables the isolated gas turbine plants in Myanaung, Shwedaung and Mann
with total installed generating capacity of 225 MVA to be connected to the
grid system, thereby allowing additional generating capacity into the
transmission system. By building a new substation at Thaketa, Yangon now has
a second 230 kV infeeding point which greatly improves system reliability and
relieve overloaded 33 kV lines and underground cables. The introduction of 66
kV lines and substations in Yangon also increases the power transmission
capability and relieve the system of existing bottlenecks. The new substation
at Taungdwingyi and Magwe ensure reliable power supply to the local areas and
also save costly diesel.
2.2         Load Dispatch Centre.  A load dispatch centre was set up at MEPE's
head office with the necessary mimic board, telemetering, teleindication and
carrier telephone facilities. This facility has assisted MEPE in its daily
operation of the power system from the head office.
2.3         System Loss Reduction.  BEI was appointed as consultant on March
1, 1984. The scheme is designed to reduce technical and non-technical energy
losses in Yangon and Mandalay. The consultants assisted in the preparation of
the rehabilitation programme and visited MEPE eleven times to monitor the
progress and advise MEPE in the implementation of the Loss Reduction
Programme. The consultants have also submitted a Project Document for
additional financing which were all forwarded to the Associates. MEPE formed
the System Loss Reduction Unit in May 1982, led by a superintending engineer
together with four members. The Unit carried out physical inspection of the
consumer installations at respective townships. This Unit also carried out
spot checks on certain domestic and industrial consumers within the City of
Yangon by using check meters.

2.4         Fixed Asset Recording and Accounting System.  The tasks undertaken
in the contract with Price Waterhouse Associates from Australia, include
preparation of asset register, depreciation register, and valuation of fixed
assets. Revalued Cost and Depreciation have been incorporated in asset
accounts. These tasks were substantially completed on March 1985 and new
assets record have been established. In October 1988, MEPE decided to rule
out the extension of the contract and the works yet to be completed were to be
resumed by the staff of the MEPE. Out of the work tasks, the following are to
be implemented:
(a)  Step  4 - Define New Asset Groupings/Classification.
(b)  Step  6 - Define New Asset Accounting Rules.
(c)  Step  7 - Define New Depreciation Methodology.
(d) Step 10 - Present Work in Progress Accounting Review.
(e) Step 11 - Define Fixed Asset Numbering.
(f) Step 16 - Establish Current Value and Value Review Bases.
(g) Step 17 - Service Life Determination.
(h) Step 18 - Balance Sheet Adjustments.
(i) Step 19 - Detailed Instructions and Training Manuals.
(j) Step 20 - Progress Reports, Meetings and Work Plan.
2.5         Establishment of Planning Department.  A separate planning
department was formed with effect from April 1st, 1983, and a personal
computer procured under the Project was assigned to the planning department to
assist in the planning activities of MEPE. EPDC International Ltd. (Japan)
signed a contract with MEPE on 24 April 1986 to work as consultant in building
up a new planning department.
2.6         Trainine.  MEPE requested IDA to delete this component from the
current Credit. Following IDA's agreements, the training allotment was
utilized for procurement of essential distribution materials and spare parts
for MEPE.
2.7         The Contractors and Suppliers.  Although some language problems
have been experienced with some of the supervisors from the Contractors, in
general the performance of the supervisors, contractors and suppliers have
been satisfactory and the quality of the equipment procured are in accordance
with MEPE Specifications. The list of contracts is attached as Annex 3.

6. Xoigect Results
A. Direct Benefits
6.1         Direct benefits will be realized through:
(a)   integration of the hydro and thermal grids which will (i) enable
the recovery of substantial hydro energy which would otherwise go
unutilized; and (ii) prolong the capacity of the hydro grid from
FY88 to FY90;
(b)   increase it reliability of supply of power to Yangon along with
reduced distribution system losses; and
(c)   improvement in system operation, through the load dispatch center
and commercial performance through the computerized billing
system.

C. Studies
6.4       The project scope included the preparation of a feasibility study of a
suitable hydro electric project to be selected to follow the implementation of the
Paunglaung multipurpose project including a power station of 280 MW. However, in
1984-85, under the World Bank/UNDP Energy Assessment Program with the Asian
Development Bank assistance, an overview of the energy sector in Myanmar was



- 21 -
undertaken..V The study included the review of the gas/hydro composition in
power generation in the content of a least cost expansion study. The study
concluded that gas based generation was more attractive than development of hydro
schemes which were considered to be more expensive. Therefore the implementation
of the Paunglaung project did not take off and study of future hydro electric
project did not start. Later un, bilateral assistance from both the Japan and the
Federal Republic of Germany were proposed to review both the potential of future
hydro-schemes and the overall long term development of the power sector in
Myanmar. However, due to the development in the political situation, these
assistance did not materialized so far. As a result of above developments, the
study included in the project scope has eventually not been undertaken.
D. Economic Imoact
6.5         The benefits listed above were expected at the time of appraisal.
However, the project SAR recognized that quantification of these benefits is not
easily established. An approach was taken to justify the entire power investment
program for the period FY82 to 87 and ascertain that it would represent the least
cost solution. Although the implementation of the least cost solution for the
investment program has resulted in several modifications, in particular regarding
new generation facilities, it can be considered that this objective has been
achieved. The economic cost of that program was compared with the benefits
arising from incremental sales in order to calculate the internal economic rate of
return (IERR). In the SAR the calculations were made for five different cases of
estimated benefits. In two cases, when the benefits were calculated in either the
prevailing trriffs in 1983, or based on regular tariff increases during the
project implementation period to meot the financial covenants, the IERR was
negative. Only when consumer's surplus were taken into consideration, the IERR
became positive. Similarly, when calculating a posteriori the IERR, based on
actual expenditures during the implementation period expressed in border terms and
converted at 1990 constant prices, the IERR is again negative when using the
actual tariff including the last rate increase, (i.e. K 0.48/kWh effective from
November 1988). The IERR remains also negative when an increase required to
ensure the financial viability of MEPE is assumed, resulting in an average rate of
K 0.68/kWh. It is only when tariffs are based on estimated long run marginal cost
for energy supply during the period 1990-2010, amounting to K 4.72/kWh4/, that
the IERR become positive. The calculations of the IERR under the various
assumptions are provided in Annex 2 and summarized in the table below:

Sector", June 1985.
