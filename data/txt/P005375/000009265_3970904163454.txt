PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
SIDI CHERO-AL M&SSIRA HYDRO PROJECT
Loan 1299-NOR
Preface
The project consisted of construction of a multipurpose dam,
hydroelectric plant and associated transmission link for which a loan of USt49
million was approved by the Board of Directors in June 1976. The loan became
effective in July 1976, was fully disbursed and was closed in December 1981.
This project completion report was prepared by the Europe, Middle
East and North Africa Regional Office based on the appraisal report and other
documents in the Bank's files, a completion report prepared by Office National
de l'Electricite (ONE), and the Direction de l'Hydraulique and the findings of
a project completion mission which visited Morocco in April-May 1983.
The PCR highlights the main points on which there was major progress
or lack of success, problems that arose during project implementation and the
lessons that can be learned from this lending operation.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department
COED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report
to the Borrower and the implementing agencies. Comments received from the
Borrower-are attached as Appendix A to the report.

SIDI CHEHO-AL MASSIRA HYDRO PROJECT
Loan 1299-MOR
PROJECT- COMPLETION-REPORT
Highlights
The project was designed to supply water for irrigation, potable and
industrial use and hydroelectric generation. Other objectives were to
optimize the water use in the Oum er Rbia, strengthen the decision-making
V        methods and procedures for the proper use of the country's water resources,
strengthen ONE's managerial capabilities, formulate a comprehensive power
sector policy and increase coordination between the various ministries and
agencies for sound overall development of natural and human resources.
No major problems affected project execution and the project was
executed essentially as appraised except for modifications necessitated by
changed conditions (paras. 3.01 and 3.02).
The project had mixed success.  While physical facilities were
completed in time and without problems, achievements on institutioinal
objectives were less than adequate in those areas where the Government's
approval was necessary.  Such was the case in regard to sector reorganization,
ONE's financial performance and collection of its bills for electricity
consumption by Goverment agencies and entities (paras. 5.02 to 5.09 and
6.01-6.02). Furthermore, the investment in the hydro dam is being
sub-optimally used because of delays in developing the water supply scheme
(para. 7.03). One reason for satisfaction is implementation of organizational
changes in ONE which have made it a more efficient utility. The Bank
identified the right issues at appraisal and showed flexibility in dealing
with Project issues.

I. INTRODUCTION
Background
1.01     Morocco's power subsector is under the control of the Ministry of
Energy and Mines (MEM) and the Ministry of Interior (MI). MEM supervises the
operations of the Office National de l'Electricite (ONE), a Government-owned
utility responsible for the generation and transmission of virtually all the
publicly supplied electricity in the country, and its distribution throughout
the country with the exception of the main urban centers. Distribution of
electricity in the main urban areas is entrusted to publicly owned utilities
(r4gies) whose operations come under the tutelage of MI. ONE sells about 601
of its production in bulk to the regies and 40% directly to final consumers.
MI is responsible for the formulation of the national rural electrification
program whose implementation is entrusted to ONE. Some industrial enterprises
produce part of their electricity requirements and have generating sets as
standby capacity or use steam generated from their industrial process. The
fragmentation of the public electricity sector poses serious problems of
coordination among the various entities and results in inefficient use of
resources through duplication, overstocking etc. These issues were recognized
as early as 1973 when the Government agreed under Loan 936-MOR to undertake a
study for the reorganization of the sector. The study was completed in 1976,
but its recommendations were not implemented. This project completion report
is based on the appraisal report and other documents in the Bank's files, a
completion report prepared by ONE and the Direction de l'Hydraulique (DH) and
on information obtained by a Bank mission from ONE and DH in April-May 1983.
Bank's Involvement in the Sector
1.02     Bank's involvement in the sector started in 1973 with a loin of USt25
million (Loan 936-MOR) to finance the integration of the Morocco's -ower
transmission-system, the installation of two gas turbine units, and consulting
services for tariff studies, the reorganization of the power subsector and
future power projects. The Project was successfully completed and a project
performance report was circulated to the Executive Directors in July 1982.
While technical performance by ONE was good and the Project was completed on
schedule, success in meeting the Project's institutional and financial
objectives was mixed. ONE's financial performance fell short of the agreed
targets, and its accounts receivable accumulated mainly on account of
non-payment of bills by Government agencies. The wider sectoral objectives of
a more rational administration of the power subsector as a whole and better
tariff structures based on marginal costs were also not achieved. These
objectives were addressed under the Sidi Cheho-Al Massira Multipurpose



-2-
Project, the subject Project which was approved by the Bank in June 1976 (Loan
1299-MNR: US$49 million). The next Bank loan was one of US$42 million
approved in 1979 to finance a rural electrification project which is now being
implemented.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Project Origin
2.01     Preliminary studies of the Al Massira site (formerly known as
Sidi Cheho) on the Oum er Rbia (the second largest river in Morocco) started
in 1938 and were continued in 1948 and 1953. Following suggestions by the
Bank, the Government commissioned in 1969 the preparation of a master plan for
the Oum er Rbia basin.  This study, completed in 1971, was subsequently
revised in 1974 with the assistance of consultants. An FAO/Bank cooperative
program mission visited Morocco in 1974 for its review and the study was
finalized in 1975. The final master plan comprised two stages, the first of
which was the completion of irrigation development in the Doukkala and Tadla
perimeters using existing diversion structures and the second the subject
Project. A Bank mission visited Morocco in March-April 1975 to discuss with
the Moroccans the economic viability of the Al Massira multipurpose dam.
Appraisal took place in December 1975.
'Negotiations
2.02     During negotiations (May 1976), the major issues were:
(i)    The reorganization of the finance department and the improvement
of accounting procedures. The Bank had proposed that
consultants be employed to formulate such a reorganization plan
which should be approved by the Bank before its implementation.
The Moroccans rejected that proposal; they agreed only to
exchange views with the Bank on such proposals before
implementing them by June 30, 1977;
(ii)    Settlement of overdue electricity accounts by Government
agencies and offices. The accounts receivable covenant under
Loan 936-MOR requiring that all power bills be paid within
90 days was superseded by a new covenant under which the
Government undertook to keep the total value of bills
outstanding from its agencies within two months of total sales
to these agencies during the previous calendar year. Completion
of legal steps to release DH 10 million and a further payment of
DH 8 million were conditions of Board presentation. To comply
with this covenant, the Government paid ONE an amount of
DH 8 million;
(iii)    The Bank had proposed that (i) the targets for the rate of
return (on ONE's assets in operation) under Loan 936-MOR be
revised under this loan so that the 7% be achieved in 1980
instead of in 1981 and (ii) agreement on a tariff increase by
January 1, 1977 sufficient to achieve the 1977 rate of return
target, be a condition of effectiveness. The Moroccan
delegation considered that in view of ONE's capital expansion



-3-
requirements, a cash generation covenant would be more
appropriate and therefore proposed that such a covenant be
substituted for the rate of return covenant. They proposed a
cash generation ratio of 18 percent in 1977 gradually rising to
reach 20 percent in 1980 and thereafter. Following the 1973
sharp increase in petroleum prices, the Government had not
passed on these increases in full to fuel consumers and was thus
giving them substantial subsidies from its budget. In order to
reduce their burden on the budget, the Government envisaged
their total elimination by early 1978. On the basis of fuel
prices prevailing at that time, it was estimated that compliance
with the cash generation covenant would require a tariff
increase of 16% in 1977 over and above any increase needed to
meet changes arising from increased fuel prices. The Moroccan
*                       delegation proposed evening out these increases by putting a 10
percent ceiling on the increase in electricity prices in 1977 to
meet the cash generation covenant, over and above any increase
necessary to offset increased fuel cost. The Bank accepted this
proposal. It was estimated that the agreed cash generation
targets would translate into the following rates of return on
assets in operation: 2.7 % in 1977, 3.9% in 1978, 4.9% in 1979
and 6.4% in 1980, more or less in line with the targets set
under Loan 936-NOR. The Moroccan delegation agreed to make the
first tariff increase effective not later than January 1, 1977.
However, this increase was not made a condition of effectiveness;
Uiv)    Allocation of joint costs of the Dam:  The Moroccan delegation
rejected the principle of allocating to each user the share of
the cost of the dam attributable to it. In support of their
position, the Moroccan delegation drew a parallel with the
Government's policy for cost recovery of major public
infrastructure such as roads where costs are recovered through
specific taxes payable only by users (taxes on gasoline and
diesel fuel) rather than user charges, an approach endorsed by
the Bank under one of its highway financed projects. In the
case of dams, the Government argued that the share of costs
attributable to electricity is recovered through specific excise
taxes levied on fuel oil and payable by ONE. This is however
not wholly correct inasmuch as ONE does not fully recover such
costs from electricity consumers through tariffs and has to rely
regularly on Government's contribution to finance its investment
program. However, the Bank accepted the Moroccan position in
view of the uncertainty over the share of the cost of Sidi Cheho
dam which should be allocated to power generation;
(v)    Organization of the Power Sector and Structure of Electricity
Tariffs: Under Loan 936-MOR, studies for the reorganization of
the sector and tariff structures had been financed and were
completed in 1976. The Bank wanted to follow-up on these
studies and proposed that the Moroccans submit proposals for the
reorganization of the sector and for the implementation of a
marginal cost based tariff, with deadlines for the
implementation of such proposals. The Moroccan delegation
however did not agree to this and as a compromise, agreed to



-4-
formulate such proposals by mid-1977 and to keep the Bank
informed of the progress achieved in this respect. The
Government's general intention was set out in a side letter;
(vi)    Cofinancing:  The Bank had proposed cross-effectiveness and
cross-default provisions in the draft Loan Agreement as linkage
witb cofinancing agreements. At the time, the Kuwait Fund was
considering a loan of about US040 million to finance the foreign
exchange gap but could not comuit funds until 1977. To avoid
substantial delay in effectiveness, the Moroccan delegation
requested, and the Bank agreed, that the cross-effectiveness and
cross-default provisions be deleted and that a Government
commitment to fill any financing gap be accepted instead; and
(vii)    Introduction of a fuel adjustment clause:  The Bank proposed,
and the Moroccans agreed, that an automatic fuel adjustment
clause that would pass on to its customers in full any changes
in ONE's cost of fuel from the January 1, 1976 level be included
in the tariffs.
A loan amount of US$49 million was approved by the Board of Directors on June
24, 1976. Loan signing took place in Washington on July 2, 1976 and became
effective November 16, 1976 after the signing of an onlending agreement
between the Government and ONE, the only condition of effectiveness, on
October 25, 1976.
Major Covenants in Loan and Project Agreements
2.03     A list of major covenants is given in Annex 2.01 together with the
extent of compliance with them.
Project Description
2.04     The project consisted of:
(i)    the construction of a concrete buttressed dam at Sidi Cheho on
the Oum er Rbia river;
(ii)    a 120-MW power plant at the foot of the dam and associated
substation/transformers;
(iii)    about 200 km of 225-KV transmission lines and the upgrading to
225-KV of the substation to be connected to such lines;
(iv)    engineering services during project execution; and
(v)    consultant's services for the preliminary studies and
preparation of bid documents for the Merija dam.



-5-
Project Objectives;
2.05     The main objectives of the Project were to:
(i)    optimize the water use in the Oum er Rbia to the extent
practicable;
tii)    further strengthen the decision-making methods and procedures
for the appropriate use of the country's water resources;
(iii)    increase coordination between the various ministries and
agencies for sound overall development of natural and human
resources;
e              (iv)    formulate a comprehensive power sector policy; and
(v)    strengthen ONE's managerial capabilities.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Project Execution
3.01     The Project was executed essentially as appraised, except for the
following modifications necessitated by (i) the need to take into account
findings made during excavations; (ii) a change in the transmission network to
adjust to the system development; (iii) additional installation of equipment
to operate the hydroplant through automated dispatching system being
constructed in Casablanca; and (iii) deletion of the study for the Merija
dam. The Bank loan provided fumds for the study of the Merija compensating
dam and associated power plant. As it turned out, adequate regulation of the
river could be achieved with the existing Imfout dam. Furthermore, the
development of irrigation in the project area and requirements of potable and
industrial water did not materialize as originally anticipated. Thus
completing the detailed design for the Merija dam and associated hydro plant
became less urgent than originally thought; in fact subsequent studies
demonstrated that it would be more economical to build two dams, eachi 15m high
solely for energy, instead of a single 30m high dam at Merija.  Det iled
designs for these dams and hydro-plants have been completed and will be
submitted to the Bank. All these modifications which did not affect the
project substantially were made after consultation with the Bank.
Problems during Project Execution
3.02     As stated earlier, no major problems affected project execution.
Bowever, the following problems emerged during implementation and were
satisfactorily solved by ONE:
(i)    soil geology problems;
(ii)    difficulties in communication between ONE and the contractor's
staff who did not speak French;



- 6-
(iii)    lack of communication facilities between the project site and
ONE's headquarters;
(iv)    lengthy and unnecessarily complicated import procedures,
frequent changes in these procedures and limited validity of
import authorization sometimes necessitating modification in the
project execution plan;
(v)    typical problems encountered in erecting transmission line. in
urban areas; and
(vi)    lack of familiarity on the part of ONE's staff with a :_ew type
of material that was introduced for the 225 kV line. Except for
securing financing for the dam, DH did not experience any                    a
problem worth mentioning. Coordination between DH and ONE was
satisfactory.
Project Financing
3.03     At the time of negotiations, there was a foreign exchange financing
gap of USS41.2 million in the project financing plan. The Kuwait Fund, the
Islamic Development Fund and the OPEC Fund had been approached to provide
financing to meet this gap but had not yet made any comitment.  Consequently,
it was agreed that pending the securing of outside financing for the dam, the
Government would make available the necessary funds to bridge the foreign
exchange financing gap in addition to the local funds required by DH to cover
the local cost of the dam (para. 2.02 (vi)).  Subsequently, the Government
obtained a loan of Saudi Rials 120 million from the Islamic Development Bank
to cover both the local and foreign cost of the dam and the OPEC Fund provided
a loan of US$3 million to finance the hydraulic gates, to be administered by
the Bank. The Bank loan was closed on December 31, 1981 and final withdrawal
on the Islamic Development Bank loan took place in March 1983.
3.04     As t:ie project was being executed, it became clear that the World
Bank loan would not be sufficient to cover the full foreign exchange cost of
the ONE component (para. 3.06). ONE successfully negotiated a loan of UC 7.6
million with the African Development Bank to meet the financing gap.
Procurement and Retroactive Financing
3.05     Goods and services financed by the Bank loan were procured in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Procurement of all main project
components following international competitive bidding was underway before
negotiations. Retroactive financing of US$5 million was approved by the Bank.
Project Costs
3.06     The total project cost exceeded appraisal estimates by 17.5Z (Annex
3.01) on account of the following factors (The impact of each individual
factor is difficult to assess):
(a)  Exchange rate variation:  For the hydro electric plant, the contract
was specified in German DM. Subsequently, the DM appreciated
substantially vis-a-vis the US dollar, the currency in which the Bank
loan was denominated, and the Moroccan dirham. At the time of
appraisal, the exchange rate was 1 DM - USSO.406 and DH 1.78.  In



-7-
Serrember 1979, these ratios were UStO.560 and DR 2.24, an increase
of 38X and 26Z respectively.  Because of this, the amount of the Bank
loan allocated to this category was no longer sufficient to cover the
foreign exchange cost of the contract; thus supplementary financing
(para_ 3.04) and a reallocation between categories became necessary.
This reallocation was approved by the Bank in September 1981 (para.
3A 6 (d));
(b) L-overnment fiscal policy: The Government increased customs duties
and tax rates on imported equipment from an estimated 25Z to about
40Z;
(c) Change in Project's scope: The final cost of the transmission
network was higher than estimated at appraisal as a result of changes
in the design of the network (220 km of transmission line erected
against 200 km estimated at appraisal); and
(d) Engineering consultant services were below the appraisal estimates
since the feasibility study for the Merija compensating dam and
associated hydro-electric plant was deleted. Part of the Bank loan
allocated to this category (UStl.9 million) was reallocated to other
categories of ONE's component for which actual cost exceeded the
amounts allocated (para. 3.06 (a)).
Disbursements
3.07     After initial delays in the disbursement of the Bank loan due to a
circuitous procedure under which ONE had to submit applications through the
Ministry of Finance, actual disbursements matched closely the appraisal
estimates. However, ONE was not always informed of the actual disbursement
status since the Bank was sending the advice of disbursement to the Ministry
of Finance which did not pass them on to ONE. This communication gap was
subsequently taken care of; at ONE's request, a duplicate of the disbursement
statement was mailed to it at regular inuervals. Annex 3.02 compares actual
disbursements with appraisal estimates.
Reporting
3.08     ONE and DR, the project implementing agencies, were informed of the
Bank's reporting requirements immediately after loan signing. In the early
days of project implementation, DH used to submit its progress report through
ONE which would forward a combined report to the Bank. Subsequently, DH
failed to prepare its progress report and ONE had to submit a report
pertaining only to its component. ONE was also required to prepare and submit
each October a financial forecast satisfactory to the Government for the
following years indicating the assumptions underlying the forecast and the
measures proposed to achieve the covenanted cash generation ratio. These
forecasts were never submitted to the Bank and forecasts were made only on the
arrival of supervision missions. Both ONE and DR prepared their input for
this PCR but the level of thoroughness was a great deal higher in ONE's case.



-8-
Environment and Resettlement
3.09     In accordance with past practice and Government regulations
concerning expropriation of private land for public interest, adequate
compensation was provided to persons displaced by the flooding of the area.
Because Bilharzia is prevalent in some areas of the Upper Oum er Rbia, an
assurance was obtained for continued monitoring of Bilharzia by the Ministry
of Public Health under the Doukkala Irrigation Project (Loan 1122-MOR) and the
Sidi Cheho Multipurpose Dam. The Ministry of Public Health has faithfully
kept its commitments.
Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3.10     Both DH and ONE were satisfied with the performance of their
consultants who did a thorough and dedicated job. DH was very satisfied with
the quality of work furnished by its contractors. ONE was generally content
with the performance of its contractors except for the communications problems
referred to in para. 3.02.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01     Since its commissioning in 1980, the power plant has been operating
very satisfactorily but below capacity because of the drought which has
prevailed in Morocco for the last three years. To this day (10/83), the dam
has not been filled. ONE's power benefits would be even less if irrigation
had developed as originally anticipated, thus subordinating water release for
power generation to the needs of irrigation. No technical problems have
appeared on the dam, the power plant and the transmission lines.
4.02    Annex 4.01 gives the forecast and actual generation of the Sidi Cheho
hydro plant which indicates that actual generation for 1980, 1981 was 45% and
55Z below the appraisal estimates because of the drought which has plagued
Morocco during these years. ONE's total sales were also below appraisal
estimates (Annex 4.02).
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Revenue Covenant
5.01          Under the Loan Agreement, ONE agreed to a cash generation
covenant replacing the rate of return covenant under Loan 936-MOR (para. 2.02
(iii)). Under this covenant, ONE agreed to take all necessary measures to
achieve in each fiscal year, starting with 1977, a contribution to investment
of at least 182, rising to 20% in 1980 and thereafter. The Government
further undertook to cause ONE to pass on in full to its customers through
automatic tariff adjustments any changes in its costs of fuel from the level
of January 1, 1976. However, it was also agreed that tariff increases in any
year to achieve the cash generation targets would be limited to 10% over and
above that required by the increase in the prices of fuel.
Performance under the Revenue Covenant
5.02    During the period 1977-1979, ONE's financial performance was
substantially in line with the agreed targets. The GoverTment implemented



necessary tariff increases for ONE to cover the increases in the prices of oil
and coal and to generate more or less the required contribution to ONE's
investment program.
5.03     On January 1, 1977, ONE was allowed to raise its tariffs by 22.3% on
average; 9.2Z of it to cover a simultaneous increase in the prices of oil and
coal and 13.1% to improve its cash generation. With this tariff increase,
ONE's cash contribution to construction in 1977 was 15.3Z (see Annex 5.03).
Although this fell somewhat short of the required 18% cash generation, it
should be considered as substantially meeting the covenant, considering the
constraints.  Helped by a scaled-down investment program replacing the 1978-82
five-year development plan by the less ambitious 1978-80 stabilization plan,
ONE also complied with the agreed contribution requirements in 1978 and 1979,
when fuel increases of about 15Z in January 1978, 25Z in January 1979 and 19%
in June 1979 were more than offset by average tariff increases of 14% on
January 1, 1978 (4% for fuel and 10% for cash contribution), and 22% on
January 1, 1979 (122 for fuel and 10% for cash contribution). The 22X was
later reduced to 16% on April 1, 1979. ONE reached self-financing levels of
24% in 1978 and 22% in 1979.
5.04     ONE's financial situation deteriorated rapidly during 1980 and
thereafter. The prices of fuel-oil and gas-oil increased by 8% and 20%
respectively in January 1980, and again by 50% and 32% respectively in June
1980. This raised ONE's total fuel bill by 54% in 1979 and 1980 but this
increase was only partially compensated by a 26.2% average tariff increase
allowed as of September 1, 1980 because the Government was reluctant to adopt
measures which might lead to social unrest. Including changes in non-cash
working capital owing to substantial increases in accounts receivable from
Government departments, ONE's internal contribution to construction dropped to
about 9% in 1980; however, excluding such changes in non-cash working capital
it was 24%.
5.05     Because of the severe drought which occurred in 1981 and 1982 and the
Government's reluctance to implement the necessary tariff increases which, in
its view, might lead to social unrest, ONE's financial situation deteriorated
further in these years, when ONE could not even meet its debt serv ce
obligations from internally generated funds. This decrease in ONF s internal
cash generation occurred while the Government was reducing its cc:.tribution to
ONE's investment program to 25% from 34% at appraisal. These factors forced
ONE to incur long-term borrowings to finance its investment program. The
effect of such heavy reliance on borrowings for investment financing has
started to show; ONE's debt service coverage ratio has quickly dropped from a
healthy 2.8 in 1978 to 1.6 in 1980, and only 0.3 and 0.4 in 1981 and 1982
respectively. Because of this, ONE has had to request the Bank's prior
approval before entering into long-term borrowing in compliance with the debt
limitation covenant. In one instance, howeverP the Bank was informed only
afterwards that ONE had issued bonds. While the debt service coverage and the
internal cash generation ratios were deteriorating fast, a satisfactory
debt/equity ratio was maintained during this period owing to the continuous
injection of Government equity capital into ONE. ONE's current ratio also
fell during this period but never below 1.0.
5.06     For mainly political reasons, the Government has resisted complying
with the automatic tariff adjustment clause which would allow the changes in



- 10 -
ONE's fuel costs to be passed on to its customers. In addition, its
application without prior adjustment in the tariff structure would have led to
further distortion of the tariff structure. Consequently, Ehe automatic
tariff adjustment clause has not been incorporated into ONE's tariff structure
and the prospects of its implementation in the near future seem rather slim.
5.07     Annexes 5.01 through 5.04 give the comparison between actuals and
appraisal financial forecasts.
Accounts Receivable
5.08     The high level of ONE's accounts receivable has been a perennial
problem. It was the subject of lengthy discussions under Loan 936-NOR, during
negotiations of this loan and in subsequent project supervision. At the heart
of the problem is the poor record of Government departments, state
corporations and regies in payment of electricity bills. As of December 31,
1975, accounts receivable by Government agencies represented 85 days of
sales. To remedy this situation, the Government undertook under this Loan to
ensure that payments due to ONE by Government agencies on account of
electricity sales and connection charges would be kept below one-sixth of the
sales to them during ONE's previous fiscal year. While the loan was being
processed, the Government took a series of measures to improve the accounts
receivable situation such as ensuring that budget allocation for electricity
expenses could not be used for other expenses by Government departments and
stipulating that the allocation for the following year would depend upon
payments made in the previous fiscal year. The Prime Minister also issued a
circular in 1976 ostensibly designed to help the electricity and water
utilities collect their dues from Government offices and agencies promptly.
However, the said circular had a negative effect for the two utilities
inasmuch as it could be, and in fact was, interpreted as allowing delayed
payment of electricity and water purchases for up to 18 months. At ONE's
insistence, as a result of the Bank's urging the Prime Minister's circular was
finally repealed at the end of 1982.
5.09     The accounts receivable situation is aggravated further by
non-payment of electricity bills by public enterprises which are facing
financial difficulties. At the end of October 1982, ONE's outstanding
accounts receivable represented 4-5 months of sales (DR 660 million). With
Morocco going through difficult economic times, there does not seem to be an
early solution in sight.
Management Information System
5.10     A recognized weakness in ONE's organization at the time of appraisal
of the previous loan (Loan 936-MOR) was the lack of a proper, well structured
finance department (para. 2.02 (i)). Under that loan, ONE undertook to
appoint a financial manager at a senior level of management to supervise the
budgeting and the accounting department. Under Loan 1299-MOR, ONE agreed to
exchange views with the Bank on the results of the study of the reorganization
of its financial department and to implement the final proposals by June 30,
1977.
ONE has fully complied with this covenant and at present, its
accounting and financial organization is good. It has competent and dedicated



- 11 -
staff and has improved the quality of its accounts and developed its financial
analysis techniques. Internal control is good, as is the system of financial
accounting. Accounts are computerized and monthly and quarterly financial
statements are produced. However, cumbersome procurement procedures have
resulted in ONE's carrying a high level of inventories to avoid possible
shortages.
Externa xudit
5.11     The audit covenant requiring ONE to have its financial statements
audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and to send the audited
financial statements and a copy of the audit report to the Bank not later than
seven months after the end of the fiscal year has been generally complied with
for all the years except for 1979 and 1981. The delay in respect of 1979
arose because of Government regulations requiring that all auditing be
performed by Moroccan firms.
Insurance
5.12     For quite some time in the past, ONE did not insure its assets and
considered itself to be self insured. Under the subject Loan, ONE agreed to
make adequate self-insurance provisions, the amount of which would be no less
than what ONE would have to pay to outside insurers should it decide to do
so. ONE has fulfilled this covenant.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Performance of the Government and ONE
6.01     ONE's performance under the Loan was good.  It consistently tried to
live up to its commitments and where it failed, as in the areas of tariffs and
finances, the failure was due to circumstances beyond its control (para.
9.01). It also responded quickly to the Bank's suggestions in financial
matters. On the other hand, the Government's performance in some matters was
disappointing. This was particularly so in regard to the reorganization of
the sector which was one of the thorniest sectoral issues on which much debate
took place with no positive outcome. The Government agreed to formulate by
June 1977 proposals for the reorganization of the electricity sector and
exchange views with the Bank on the proposals being developed for the purpose
but failed to take the agreed action.  ONE had engaged an expatriate firm of
consultants under the previous Loan (936-MOR) to carry out a sector
reorganization study. This study was submitted to the Government but received
very little consideration at the Governmental level.  Also, the Bank's views
on it were never sought. As a result, the same problems which were identified
as arising from the fragmentation of the sector still continue unabated.
Coordination between ONE and the regies and between the respective ministries
is still lacking in the areas of investment planning and load forecasting,
standardization of equipment and network management.
6.02     Tariffs is another area where performance fell short of
expectations. The fuel adjustment clause which was agreed upon under this
Loan was never introduced in the tariffs. With respect to the tariff
structure itself, although some progress (simplification, removal of rebates



- 12 -
ard reduction of tariff categories) has been made, the basic objective of a
structure based on marginal costs has not been achieved.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
7.01     At appraisal, the economic justification of the Project involved
three steps:
(i)    the demonstration that the Sidi Cheho Multipurpose dam
constituted the least cost solution;
(ii)    the calculation Gf an overall economic rate of return; and
(iii)    the calculation of individual returns for each of the three
subprojects after allocating the joint costs of the dam.
Least Cost Alternative:
7.02     The least cost analysis consisted of selecting independent or
combined alternative subprojects which could fulfill the same function as the
multipurpose project.
For irrigation and water supply, the alternative was considered to be
a smaller dual purpose dam at Sidi Cheho. For power, the alternative involved
the development of generation capacities to provide what would have otherwise
been generated by Sidi Cheho. The project represented the least cost
alternative for meeting the power, water and irrigation requirements. Given
the escalation in the price of fuel which would represent the-source of energy
for the alternative to Sidi Cheho, the project remains the least cost
alternative to the economy.
Project Benefits
7.03     The project was designed to supply water for irrigation, potable and
industrial use and hydroelectric generation. Project benefits are briefly
discussed below.
(i)    Water Supply:  The Sidi Cheho multipurpose dam was designed to
meet demand for potable and industrial use for the Atlantic
Coast up to the years 2000 estimated at about 250 Mm3. At the
time of appraisal, it was assumed that the supply of water
regulated by the dam would commence in 1983 with an annual
growth rate of at least 7%. However, the demand for water
supply has not materialized as anticipated at appraisal and is
unlikely to reach that level for quite sometime. Water use by
industry was expected to stem from the port and petrochemical
complex at Jorf El Lasfar, the constructions of which are behind
schedule. The earliest date of their commissioning is now
expected to be 1985 instead of 1983 as originally planned. With
regard to potable water, a project for the supply to the city of
Casablanca and other coastal towns is only being considered and
is planned to be completed in 1988 under the most optimistic



- 13 -
scenario. Hence, benefits from water supply accruing to the
Project are substantially lower than anticipated at appraisal.
As a corollary to this, capital and operating costs of the water
supply scheme have been delayed.
(ii)    Irrigation: The Doukkala II Irrigation Project, appraised in
1977, is being implemented. Of the 16,600 ha to be irrigated
with the water regulated by the Sidi Cheho dam, 9,600 ha were
put in service in 1982, 3,700 ha are to be put in service this
year and the remainder is expected to come under irrigation in
1984.
(iii)    Electric Power: The hydroelectric plant has been in service
since 1980 but is operating below capacity because of the
f0                     drought which has plagued Morocco since 1981 (para. 4.01).
Actual electricity generation is substantially higher than what
it would have been under the same hydrological conditions if the
other subcomponents to which the release of water is
subordinated had been implemented as originally planned. Thus,
ONE is advantageously operating the hydroelectric plant without
needing a compensating dam.
Economic Rate of Return
7.04     The ex-post economic rate of return was calculated on the basis of
the methodology used at the time of appraisal but with data adjusted to
reflect actual changes in costs and benefits attributable to the project.
Benefits for power are calculated using existing tariffs expressed in 1976
prices and actual GWh generated for power. Future generation is assumed to be
what it would be under normal hydrological year. Benefits for the agriculture
component expressed in economic prices are calculated using yield patterns
observed in the Doukkala I Project with actual production phased out according
to the planned commissioning of the Doukkala II Project. Because of the
uncertainties surrounding future demand for water and its associated capital
and operating costs, the water supply component has not been taken into
account for the calculation of the ex-post ERR. On the above basis, a higher
ex-post ERR of 11.1L (Annex 7.01) compared to the 9.6% projected at appraisal
is obtained. Such an increase is mainly attributable to the power component
whose electricity tariffs increased annually by an average 4% in real terms
during the period 1976-1982, while the appraisal report used the then
prevailing electricity tariff kept constant in real terms.
VIII. PERFORMANCE OF THE BANK
U.-
8.01     The Bank performance during the appraisal of the Project and in the
administration of the Loan has been generally satisfactory, although it could
be faulted for not pursuing rigorously the question of reorganization of the
sector. The Bank identified the right issues at appraisal and perhaps might
have achieved better results if it had followed them up consistently and with
vigor during the course of supervision. Bank staff maintained good relations
with both ONE, DR and the Government. They also showed flexibility in dealing
with issues which arose during project execution, e.g. change in project scope
(para. 3.01), reallocation of funds between categories (para. 3.06). There
was however a lack of continuity in the project staff supervising the Project



- 14 -
owing mainly to transfers of staff on re-assignment. Nevertheless,
supervision missions were mounted at regular intervals.
IX.  CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
9.01     The Project was successfully executed and has an ex-post economic
rate of return higher than the one estimated at appraisal. Institutional
objectives were partially achieved. ONE's performance under the loan was
satisfactory.
9.02     On balance, results on achievement of institutional objectives were
as follows: on the positive side, ONE has developed into a mature and
commercially oriented organization during the period of the loan despite the
serious financial problems that emerged after 1980. There was also a meeting
of the minds with ONE on most of the important sector issues such as sector
reorganization, tariffs and planning. Yet, it is on these basic aspects that
there was failure to achieve the project's institutional goals. The
GoverDment's reluctance to raise tariffs even to keep pace with fuel costs,
non-payment of ONE's bills by Government agencies and entities and
Government's unwillingness to enforce such payments were at the heart of the
deterioration of ONE's financial situation. Further, in spite of the
availability of a tariff study and a study for the reorganization of the
sector, the Gover ent did not follow-up on these.
Lessons to be Learned
9.03     There are two important lessons to be learned from this lending
operation:
(a) When exogenous factors develop inhibiting satisfactory
performance on the part of a project entity, as when severe
drought occurred in 1981 and 1982 or substantial changes
occurred in the country's economic situation, the Bank should
review the covenants in the light of the changed conditions and
the entity's ability to comply with the covenants in such
conditions, and, if appropriate, set revised targets and ensure
strict compliance with the revised targets. Otherwise,
covenants would cease to be flexible tools for achieving
realistic goals; and
(b) Instead of attempting major reforms like the reorganization of
the power sub-sector in one sweep under a single loan, it might
be more productive if the changes sought are phased over a
longer time span under several loans, and manageable components
within the implementation capacity of Government and the
borrower are handled under each loan.
