I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Morocco has requested a US$9.5 million Bank loan
to finance a pilot project (the Project) for small scale mining in the
Tafilalet and Figuig region in southeastern Morocco. The region lacks basic
infrastructure and, outside the oases, has little agricultural or other
economic potential, except for mining. There are an estimated 15,000 artisanal
miners who derive their income principally from mining lead and zinc ore in
about 1,600 mines with small and irregular--but very rich--ore deposits. A
proportion of the mine workers live nomadic lives, working in a succession of
mines and living in tents close to active mining sites. Productivity is low
due to the rudimentary mining methods used and the average per capita income
of miners in 1981 was US$250, more than 50% below the agricultural minimum
wage.
1.02      The proposed Bank loan of US$9.5 million will finance two mobile
concentrators, a mobile crushing and grinding unit, basic mining equipment
packages for some 40 selected mines (including compressors, jackhammers,
hoists, pumps, mine cars and rails), as well as geological studies, training
and equipment for workshops and laboratories. The Bank loan would be made to
the Government of Morocco and would be on-lent to the Centrale d'Achat et de
Developpement de la Region Miniere du Tafilalet et de Figuig (CADETAF).
CADETAF is a mining extension service entity responsible for providing various
forms of assistance to the miners. It also has a purchasing and marketing
monopoly for the artisanal production. The total project cost is estimated at
US$15.2 million. Incremental project production of lead concentrate is
estimated at about 14,500 tpy, and of zinc concentrate at about 7,500 tpy,
about one and-a-half times the present production rate.
1.03      The Project has been designed on a pilot scale that will test the
miners reactions to its various components and operating procedures to
determine the most appropriate form of assistance. The miners make independent
decisions regarding their mine production according to ore prices and inter-
mittent agricultural as well as other non-mining activities. The success of
the Project depends to a large degree on whether or not sufficient ore will be
produced to maintain a consistently high level of utilization of the concentra-
tors and mechanized mining equipment. Being only a first step, the Project
should, if successful, lead to a subsequent, larger development of the mining
sector and associated activities in the region.
1.04      The Project was appraised in December 1980 by a mission consisting
of Messrs. J. Franz (Chief) and N. Ahmad of the Industrial Projects Department,
and A. Khilkoff-Choubersky (Consultant). A short follow-up mission took place
in end-March 1981. A glossary of mining terms is given in Annex 1.

II. THE MINING SECTOR
A.   Structure of the Moroccan Mining Sector
2.01      Morocco has a long mining tradition, possessing the world's largest
reserves of phosphate rock, as well as modest reserves of iron, lead, zinc,
manganese, cobalt and copper. While the mining sector-s contribution to GDP
has decreased from a peak of 13.0% in 1974 to 4.8% in 1979, mostly due to a
decline in phosphate prices, its importance for the balance of payments is
very significant. Mining exports in 1979 accounted for about 35% of foreign
exchange earnings. Phosphate rock is by far the most important mineral,
accounting for about 90% of export tonnage and 74% of the sector-s foreign
exchange earnings in 1979. Mining employment consists of about 40,000 workers
in industrial mines, plus some 15,000 artisanal miners, representing a little
over 1% of the country's total labor force.

2.02      Lead is the most important of the non-phosphate minerals, accounting
for 32% of the non-phosphate export value, followed by manganese (12%), cobalt
(9%), iron ore (8%), and zinc (4%). The non-phosphate production is mostly
exported in concentrate form, the major exception being lead. Since 1975,
the domestic lead smelter Plomb de Zellidja (PZ) in Oued el Heimr (Map) has
processed an increasing portion of Morocco's lead ore production (1978:28%).
This share will increase further as PZ-s smelting capacity was expanded in
1980 from 35,000 tpy of metal to 50,000 tpy.

2.03      The phosphate subsector is managed by the Office Cherifien des
Phosphates (OCP), a state-owned enterprise which has full responsibility
for mining, exporting and--through its subsidiaries--processing rock phosphate
into intermediate and finished fertilizer. The other, non-phosphate, mining
activities are under the administrative aegis of the Ministry of Energy
and Mines (MEM), which provides general guidance and supervision through the
Directorate of Mines (DOM). The Bureau de Recherches et de Participation
Minieres (BRPM) is the state-owned enterprise responsible for government
participation in mining activities other than phosphate and was also respon-
sible for oil and gas exploration and production until 1981. BRPM and its
kover 30) subsidiaries undertake mine exploration, development, and operations.
These companies, in which BRPM's participation, valued at US$90 million,
ranges from 22% to 100%, produce a number of mineral products including iron
ore, manganese ore, copper, lead, cobalt and zinc concentrates, silver, salt
and barites. BRPM is also responsible for marketing these products as well as
CADETAF's concentrates. BRPM employs 1,550 people on its permanent staff,
including 191 engineers, while companies in which BRPM holds an interest, have
some 13,100 employees.
B.   The Artisanal Mining Sector
2.04      Artisanal production of lead and zinc concentrates from small and
irregular--but very rich--ore deposits (up to 85% ore grade) takes place
in the Tafilalet and Figuig region (Map). The term "artisanal mining" is
the mining sector equivalent of "cottage industry" used in industry. Specifi-
cally it refers to mining undertaken by independent individuals or by small,
informal groups, using only hand tools, with very low production rates--
generally no more than a few hundred tons per year by any particular work
group. Until 1938, mineral development was forbidden on the disputed southern
Atlas mountains for security reasons. Early efforts at mineral exploitation
under the French protectorate were stopped by World War II. Reserves in the
Tafilalet region were opened to industrial mining companies in 1952 and
exploited by the Societe Miniere de l'Atlas Marocain and the Societe Miniere
de I'Adrar. Both private firms closed down operations in 1958 as a result of
high energy and ore transport costs, difficulties in recruiting technicians to
work in the remote regions and gradual depletion of deposits. Local miners,
many of whom had worked for these two companies, rapidly initiated unautho-
rized artisanal activities. The ore thus mined was sold (illegally) to
middlemen operating out of Erfoud. To protect the miners from exploitation
and to encourage mining of the numerous known lead and zinc outcrops, legisla-
tion was introduced in 1960 leading to the creation of CADETAF anf an artisanal
mining concession comprising a contiguous area of about 48,000 km in the
Errachidia, Figuig and Ouarzazate provinces.
2.05      The deposits usually occur as fracture filling or veins in carbonate
rock. They are narrow, often short and unpredictable and at times they
continue below the water table. In most cases, they could not support an
industrial operation. Therefore, artisanal mining is not only appropriate,
but the only feasible method of exploiting these deposits.



-4-
2.06      In total, some 500 occurrences of lead and some 80 occurrences
of zinc are known. With few exceptions, these have never been explored
systematically. For 217 lead outcrops and veins known with sufficient
certainty from stopes, downward development and past production, CADETAF
has made a conservative theoretical reserve estimates given below:
Lead Ore Reserves--CADETAF Estimate of 217 Occurrences
Ore Reserves         Average Grade          Lead Reserves
('000 tons)               (M)                ('000 tons
metal content)
Proven                       653                  10.98                    72
Probable                     662                   7.92                    52
Total                   1,315                    9.45                   124
The lead reserves thus estimated are equivalent to about 15 times CADETAF's
expected annual production including the Project and, thus, are large enough
to support the Project; however, actual lead reserves are certainly much
larger. New outcroppings continue to be discovered, while extensions of
existing mines have led to the discovery of further veins.
2aO7      No attempt has been made to systematically estimate the evidently
1arge zinc reserves. Most zinc deposits are irregular cavity-fillings,
requiring systematic exploration by drilling to determine shape, size and
content before meaningful estimates can be established. Exploration of
somee zinc deposits will be carried out under the Project (para 5.25).
21U8      The level of artisanal production is presently limited by the lack
o- ore concentration facilities that can process low-grade ore into a market-
able concentrate. In order to be marketable without further processing, the
lead and zinc ores mined by the artisans must have a metal content of at
least 30% and 35% respectively. By comparison, ore grades of 2% to 9% are
viable for development in other mines worldwide. Furthermore, the lack of ore
beneficiation facilities results in undesirable exploitation practices, since
the miners tend to mine merely the richest parts of a vein, thus despoiling
--often irreparably--the deposit.
2.09      Low productivity, due to an almost complete absence of basic
mechanized mining equipment, is another factor which limits production.
Mining and concentrating methods used by the artisans are manual with only
rudimentary equipment such as manual mining hammers, hand winches, wheel-
barrows, manual jigs and sluice boxes. Over 50% of the time is now taken up
for tramming and hoisting the ore. Also, the lack of mechanized implements
makes the work in the mines physically demanding since mining reaches depths
of 100 meters below surface. Miners generally work for four weeks, then rest
for one week before continuing work in the mine.
2.10      In 1979, artisanal mining accounted for 11,260 tons of lead concen-
trate and 5,517 tons of zinc concentrate, equivalent to 11% of Morocco-s lead
concentrate exports and 21% of its zinc concentrate exports. Among the
some 15,000 miners, an estimated 11,000, or 73%, are thought to be full-time



- 5 -
miners having negligible or no side activities. For an estimated 3,000, or
20%, mining is a seasonal activity, interrupted by harvest and other agricul-
tural work, not only in the region, but also in other parts of the country.
The remaining 1,000, or 7%, pursue mining as a temporary activity, for example
when prices are high. About 50% of the miners work their mines on a family
basis. Most of the other 50% have organized themselves along tribal lines in
several hundred informal miners' associations, having between 5 and 60 members.
In addition, there are three formal mining cooperatives with together 169
members (Skendis-50, Hawanit-32, Tamslamt-87). The miners being proudly
independent, all groupings are based on partnerships and hired labor is
non-existent in the mines. Production varies from 50 kg of concentrate per
month for some of the miners who work on an individual basis to 40 tons per
month for the largest associations and cooperatives.
2.11      While the Government has granted general mining rights to the local
population, it does not administer individual mining rights. The latter is in
the hands of the respective local "Djemaa," or Council of Artisans, which
sanction individual mining rights along procedures that vary among different
sub-regions. This system is not very formal, but has functioned well in the
past and few disputes have occurred. In new mining areas within the mining
region, which are not under the jurisdiction of the traditional authorities,
CADETAF administers the granting of mining rights and issues permits to
miners. This applies equally in cases where CADETAF itself has helped develop
the mine. During the process, CADETAF cooperates closely with the local
representative of DOM and the local authorities to ensure that there are no
conflicting claims. The system is expected to work well under the project
and does not require any change.
III. CADETAF
A.   Background
3.01      CADETAF was created in 1960 as a non-profit public agency and placed
under the authority of MEM whose Directorate of Mines (DOM) exercises the
administrative control over CADETAF. Until 1978, CADETAF's head office was in
Rabat and its management consisted of BRPM staff who combined their CADETAF
responsibilities with other functions. In early 1979, CADETAF's head office
was relocated to Errachidia which is in the center of the mining region with a
small liaison office remaining at Rabat. At the same time, the management was
replaced by a new team working for CADETAF on a full-time basis and being
employed by CADETAF rather than BRPM. Both actions have been instrumental in
revitalizing CADETAF and the artisanal mining sector and came at a time when
metal prices were strengthening after a period of very low prices during
1975-78.
B.   Objectives
3.02      CADETAF is a mining extension service, (similar to an agricultural
extension service), which provides a broad package of support services for
the mining operations and social needs of the miners. CADETAF's specific
responsibilities include:



-6-
(a)  purchase and marketing of ore;
(b)  provision of mining inputs and technical assistance to
miners; and
(c)  provision of social services, such as medical facilities
and medical and accident insurance.
3.03      The assistance to the miners, which may vary from place to place,
presently can take one or more of the following forms: (i) provision of
explosives; (ii) provision of hand tools, such as hammers, shovels, wheel-
barrows, sacks and other artisanal mining implements; (iii) transportation of
ore from the mine to the collection centers; (iv) pumping in areas where the
mineralization extends below the water table; (v) provision of basic medical
services; (vi) geological surveys, geometric bearings and other forms of
technical assistance; (vii) upgrading of zinc ore in calcination ovens; and
(viii) construction and maintenance of mining roads.
C.   Organization, Staffing and Management
3.04      Operating out of Errachidia, CADETAF presently has seven ore col-
lection centers (Map) which serve as concentrate purchase centers and as
distribution centers for assistance and materials. The centers usually have
an office building, a small warehouse for mining inputs, and scales to weigh
ore purchases which are stocked in the open yard (surrounded by a wall).
Three of the centers also have a shop for equipment repairs and a nurse for
medical assistance. Geological services, carpentry and masonry work are
provided by the center in Errachidia. CADETAF also operates self-constructed
vertical calcination kilns at Tizi N'Firest and Beni Tadjit for beneficiation
of zinc ores with a total capacity of about 20,000 tpy zinc concentrates. It
has a branch office in Rabat and an ore storage facility at the mining port
of Kenitra-Mehdiya, 30 km north of Rabat. An organization chart is shown on
the following page.
3.05      CADETAF's operations are supervised by a 19 member Administrative
Board, chaired by a representative of MEM (1), and consisting of representa-
tives of other concerned ministries (5) 1/; DOM (1); BRPM (1); the Governors
of the Provinces of Errachidia, Ouarzazate and Figuig (3); and miners' repre-
sentatives (8). The latter are selected by the Governors of each of the three
provinces on a representative basis, and appointed for a period of three
years. The Board is not involved in day-to-day management, but sets the
guidelines for CADETAF's activities. In particular, the Board must consent
to: (i) the annual investment and operating budget; (ii) the price of mining
inputs sold to miners; (iii) conditions and terms of equipment loans to
miners; (iv) employment and salary guidelines for CADETAF's staff; (v) all
contracts with third parties; (vi) application for and acceptance of loans
from banks, as well as advances and subsidies from Government; and (vii)
CADETAF's financial statements.
3.06      CADETAF is headed by a Director General, responsible for overall
management. Its key staff are an ore purchase officer, responsible also for
providing mining inputs, one mining engineer and one geologist, jointly
1/   Namely Interior; Finance; Public Works; Labor; and Commerce.

responsible for all forms of technical assistance, one financial and adminis-
trative officer, and the heads of the ore collection centers. CADETAF's
permanent staff totals 250 plus 25 occasional laborers; 40 staff work at the
head office, 10 in Rabat and Kenitra, and 200 at the ore collection centers.
Salaries for laborers and unskilled workers are paid according to local
standards or minimum wage regulations. Salaries for medium and higher level
staff, who have to be recruited from other parts of the country, contain
bonuses of up to 50% over normal civil service salaries in order to attract
qualified staff to Errachidia. Despite the remote location, CADETAF has been
able to attract suitable staff, and recruitment of adequately qualified staff
is not expected to be a problem in the future.
3.07      CADETAF's new management, appointed in 1979 after relocation to
Errachidia, has succeeded in reviving assistance to the miners after the
1975-78 crisis, while at the same time reducing CADETAF's operating expenses.
CADETAF's key personnel is competent and motivated, but needs to be strength-
ened both in number and available skills to implement the Project (para. 5.38).
The distribution of functions between head office and collection centers is
adequate; within the head office, some organizational changes are required to
reflect the widened scope of future activities (paras. 5.38-5.41).
3.08      CADETAF's day-to-day financial management, including the prepara-
tion and presentation of its financial statements, is supervised by a local
controller from the Ministry of Finance (MOF). His approval is required for
all expenditures above US$50, except for ore purchases where there is no
limit, and salaries, which are budgeted.
D.   Past Operations, Performance and Operating Procedures
1. Ore Purchase
3.09      The artisanal production of lead and zinc ores is purchased by
CADETAF at ore collection centers. The lead ores then are upgraded, through
further manual crushing and sorting, into marketable concentrates with about
60% metal content. The zinc ores are processed in calcination ovens, which
yield a concentrate of about 50% metal content. After upgrading, the Office
National des Transports (ONT) transports the concentrate by trucks to Kenitra-
Mehdiya (600 km), the ore port from where it is exported in 1,000 to 2,500-ton
lots to Europe.
3.10      At present, the miners receive a fixed monthly price for their ore,
which is calculated by DOM by deducting certain specified charges from the
previous months's average London Metal Exchange (LME) price for lead, and
the previous months European Producer Price (EPP) for zinc. The deductions
comprise land transportation, port handling, shipping and smelting costs;
taxes (zinc: 0.5% on minehead price; lead: 5% on minehead price if the
LME price is below or equal to US$870 per ton and 10% if above); transport
losses (1.5% on minehead price); and CADETAF-s service margin (25% on minehead
price for all administrative costs, investments and technical assistance).
Historically, the deductions have averaged 42% of the net metal value, leaving
58% for the miners.

3.11      CADETAF's ore purchases are subject to considerable annual fluc-
tuations associated with movements in international lead and zinc prices.
The miners tend to increase production when prices are high and reduce if
prices fall, as shown in the following table:

b/   Estimated.
3.12      According to CADETAF's management, the decline in ore purchases
during price slumps is accentuated by a tendency of miners to hoard part
of their production, hoping for prices to improve. Further, CADETAF's
purchases are also shaved during periods of high prices when miners are
tempted to sell (illegally) part of their production to other private mining
concerns which are willing to pay higher prices than CADETAF. Since such
other internal markets exist for high grade ores, the incentive to sell to
these markets would be increased by any measures to stabilize prices. Thus
a scheme to buffer prices would face severe problems, as it would be very
difficult to keep control of the artisanal production which would be essential
to the operation of a stabilization fund. Furthermore, the fact that artisanal
mining is often not a full-time employment and that the work force is subject
to considerable fluctuations argues against the possible effectiveness of such
a scheme.



- 10 -
3.13      The ore pricing formula implies that CADETAF's revenues from the 25%
withholding margin vary with changing metal prices and artisanal production
levels. Further, CADETAF carries a price risk associated with the shipping
period of four to six months for the ore to reach the port of destination.
The smelter (abroad) pays CADETAF the price prevailing on the arrival date,
whereas, as noted, the formula used to calculate CADETAF's payment to the
miners is based on prices prevailing in the month prior to the ore purchase.
Thus, if prices decline during the shipping period, CADETAF's margin is
reduced, and if prices rise, it increases.
2. Services and Technical Assistance
3.14      CADETAF provides explosives and other supplies such as picks,
shovels, wheelbarrows, manual drill bits, hammers and ore sacks, which are
sold to the miners at cost on a cash and carry basis. CADETAF has first-aid
posts at each collection center and three doctors are on contract. They make
weekly rounds and are available to miners and their families. CADETAF insures
miners for minor accidents with the state Caisse de Secours, paid for through
CADETAF's service margin. For more serious job-related illness and accidents,
miners are protected by an insurance policy with the private SIDARSA Insurance
of Essarda and Casablanca. Apparently, so far this insurance has only had to
be used once.
3.15      CADETAF provides technical assistance which has centered around:
(i) construction of ore collection centers; (ii) construction and operation
of two zinc calcination facilities at Tizi N'Firest and Beni Tadjit; (iii)
geological surveys and drillings, mostly to locate the continuation of exist-
ing veins and fracture fillings already exploited, but also to identify new
deposits; (iv) boring of shafts (vertical) and galleries (horizontal) for
exploration and production; (v) de-watering about 60 small mines in the Erfoud
sub-region, where underground water would otherwise make production impossible;
and (vi) maintenance and repair work of mining roads.
3.16      The various forms of technical assistance are funded out of CADETAF's
25% withholding margin and thus provided free of charge. CADETAF had to
reduce its technical assistance because of low revenues during the period of
low metals prices from 1975-78. Geological drilling as well as shaft boring
were discontinued in 1978 and were only recommenced in 1981, following the
recovery of revenues in 1979 and 1980. Shown below are past revenues and
technical assistance of CADETAF:

3.17      Despite the limitations in scope due to equipment, manpower and
financial constraints, CADETAF's technical assistance has been effective in
supporting artisanal production. Furthermore, CADETAF has been able to
allocate its assistance reasonably equitably among the sub-regions and among
lead and zinc producers.

3.19      CADETAF's capital consists of an interest-free advance from the
Government of DH 2 million (US$0.385 million) which, as confirmed by Govern-
ment, will not be repayable until the completion of the Project or at the
latest until December 31, 1986. As stated (para. 3.10) CADETAF derives its
revenues from the 25% withholding margin on the minehead price of the ore.
The ore-pricing formula stipulates that 60% of the witholding margin is to
cover CADETAF's administrative and investment costs and 40% is to finance
assistance to the miners. In practice, the two categories cannot be kept
entirely separate because personnel and material are often employed for both
categories at the same time. CADETAF, therefore, in its financial statements,
accounts for the totality of its operating expenses. However, part of the
technical assistance is shown under self-constructed assets, which are fully
cepreciated in the same year.  Since CADETAF-s revenues from its fixed with-
holding margin fluctuate with metal prices and artisanal production, its
operating expenses in percentage of ore purchases have varied between 23.4%
and 79.1% between 1974 and 1981. If total expenditures are above 25% of ore
purchases, CADETAF usually suffers a loss (except when prices rise between ore
purchase and sale--para. 3.13), which it must finance either by drawing on
reserves or by increasing its current liabilities.
3.20      Up to 1974, CADETAF benefited from favorable prices and increasing
artisanal production, enabling it to reimburse the initial US$0.19 million
Government advance and accumulate reserves of about US$2.87 million at the
end of 1974. In 1975, a sharp decrease in metal prices depressed artisanal
production and subsequently CADETAF's revenues. By 1979, the prolonged
duration of unfavorable metal prices had developed to crisis proportions.
Other factors aggravated the situation: the distance of CADETAF's management
(then in Rabat) from the operational area; inadequacies in the technical
control system which permitted the over-valuation of ore purchases; and a
mi_aagement decision to hold on to over-valued ore stocks in the hope of
obtaining better prices. The combination of these factors led to large
operating losses and negative cash flows, which severely strained CADETAF's
liquidity position and resulted in delays in payment to miners for ore.
3.21      To deal with this crisis, an inter-ministerial commission was
appointed in July 1978. It recommended separating management from BRPM and
making it exclusively responsible for CADETAF: a reform of the accounting
system and practices- and relocation of the head office from Rabat to
Errachidia. These measures were implemented in March 1979, supported by an
interest-free Government advance of US$0.385 million (para. 3.19). Sharply
higher metal prices in 1979 have also greatly contributed to a recovery of ore
production and a strengthening of CADETAF's financial position. Another step
was to reduce CADETAF's inflated field staff: personnel costs, in current
terms, were 10% lower in 1979 than in 1977. For the first time since 1974,
CADETAF, in 1979, had an operating surplus of US$1.23 million. CADETAF's
operating result in 1980 was slightly negative at minus US$0.2 million. For
1981, an operating surplus of US$0.44 million is estimated.
3.22      CADETAF's accounts are kept by a qualified bookkeeping staff who
prepare annual income statements and balance sheets as well as an operating
and investment budget. The accounting system is subject to the financial
control of the MOF in lieu of an external audit. Presently lacking are a cost

accounting system and a budgeting system permitting the setting of objectives
for individual operating units and to measure performance against objectives.
Equally lacking is a system for long-term financial planning which, given
CADETAF's environment, would be particularly beneficial. Both areas are
addressed under the proposed Project (para. 5.35).
IV. MARKET ASPECTS FOR LEAD AND ZINC
A.   Market Conditions and Outlook for Lead
1. Lead Production and Reserves
4.01      World reserves of contained lead are estimated at 115 million tons,
of which 82 million tons (71%) are found in the USA, Canada and Australia.
In addition, 125 million tons of lead resources are known and the prospect for
discovery of additional reserves is highly favorable.
4.02      The supply of lead comes from two sources--mine production (60-70%)
and scrap (or secondary) recovery (30-40%).  Five countries--USA, Australia,
Canada, Mexico and Peru--supplied 62% of world mine production of 2.6 million
tons in 1980. Sixty-three percent of production was exported, mainly to
Europe and Japan. Morocco accounted for 126,000 tons or 4.6% of world
production, of which 90% was exported to Europe and the remainder consumed
domestically. Seventy percent of lead mine output is from co-product or
by-product production, mainly in combination with zinc but also with silver
and copper. Primary lead production is therefore affected to a degree by the
market situation for these other metals. During the 1960s, primary lead
production increased by 3.8% annually, but stagnated in the 1970s, when it
actually declined in the industrialized countries, as follows:

2. Lead Consumption
4.03      The principal use of lead is for storage batteries which account
for nearly 50% of world lead consumption. Gasoline additive, cable sheathing,
chemicals and soldering are other important uses. Consumption grew steadily
in the 1960s, but growth rates fell off in the 1970s, as shown above, espe-
cially in industrialized countries as a result of the slump in automobile
manufacturing and the shift to smaller cars with lighter batteries following
the oil crisis in 1973-74. However, growth of consumption was also reduced by
other factors, including a decline in the use of lead as a gasoline additive
and substitution by plastics in a variety of uses, including building con-
struction, electrical cable covering and in cans and containers. Net imports
by CPEs averaged 30,000-50,000 tpy in the early 1970s and increased to over
100,000 tpy in 1978 and 1979.
3. Lead Supply/Demand Balance and Price Prospects
4.04      Concern over future lead prices resulted in investment decisions
in new mines being delayed by a "wait and see" attitude during the early
and mid-1970s. However, investment strengthened in the late 1970s and latest
estimates indicate an additional 200,000-300,000 tons (metal content) of
new primary capacity under construction or on stream by 1985, including the
Aggeneys mine in Namibia starting production in 1981 with an eventual capacity
of 90,000 tpy metal content. In addition, there are many known ore bodies in
the main producing countries with good lead grades suitable for development.
4.05      The future demand for lead depends largely on the battery sector
since the use of lead as a gasoline additive is expected to decline further
and no growth is foreseen in other uses such as cable covering or chemicals.
Consumption of lead in the traditional battery market is expected to increase
steadily in the 1980s. Lead will also likely be required for batteries for
electric vehicles in the late 1980s. Recent assessments by various industry
and other groups including the forecast prepared by the Economic and Analysis
Projections Department and issued in IBRD Report 814/80 indicate a growth rate
in the 1980s of between 1.4% and 3.3% annually, as shown below:

4.06      This report estimates future consumption growth at 2.0% per year
based on the following assumptions: (i) 2.0% per year growth in lead
requirements for conventional batteries in industrialized countries; (ii)
400,000 tpy lead requirements for electric vehicle batteries in industrialized
countries in 1990; (iii) zero growth in lead use by other sectors in indus-
trialized countries; and (iv) 3.75% per year consumption growth from 1980-90
in developing countries. Bringing together the production and demand trends,
the outlook for lead supply and demand is that production will exceed demand
in the early 1980s, but supply and demand will be in balance in the mid-1980s
as shown below:

4.07      Virtually all the world's lead outside North America is traded
at the LME price, or prices based on the LME price. The LME price is set on a
twice daily basis and is extremely sensitive to changes in supply and demand,
with an average change of plus/minus 15% annually from 1955-78. During the
late 1970s, a strong price boom occurred when consumption consistently exceeded
supplies due to a combination of factors, including: (i) a loss of lead
production capacity resulting from lead-zinc mine closures due to depressed
zinc prices; and (ii) unexpectedly high battery demand for three years in a
row following severe winters in 1977, 1978 and 1979. In 1979 prices averaged
US$1,203 per ton but in 1980 a surplus occurred and prices averaged US$906 per
ton. 1/
1/   LME lead price has fallen to US$660 per ton in March 1981 as a result
of lower than expected consumption during the mild winter of 1980.

4.08      Lead prices are projected to recover from their 1981 low to US$880
per ton in 1980 terms by 1985 and to continue at that level until the end of
the decade, as shown above. This is based on estimates of total produc-
tion costs for refined lead of US$770-880 per ton in 1980 terms for new
production units and US$425-850 per ton (in 1980 terms) for existing opera-
tions. This is more conservative than the most recent (December 1981) IBRD
forecast of US$980 per ton in 1990 (in 1980 terms) and is used in view of the
sensitivity of the financial projections to the price assumption. This
forecast is a long-term trend price that assumes no major imbalance occurs
between supply and demand and that lead producers adjust production to keep
supplies broadly in line with demand.
B.   Market Conditions and Outlook for Zinc
1. Zinc Production and Reserves
4.09      World reserves of zinc are estimated at 138 million tons (contained
metal), of which 73 million tons (52%) are located in Australia, Canada and
the USA. The remaining reserves are widely distributed in many countries. In
addition, 121 million tons of resources are known. If all other reported zinc
deposits, including presently sub-economic resources, were included, the world
total would be 5.6 billion tons, including 800 million tons of ocean nodules.



- 17 -
4.10      Australia, Canada and the USA accounted for 47% of the world mine
production of zinc of 4.6 million tons in 1980; 63% of the production of these
three countries was exported, largely from Canada and Australia to Europe.
Morocco accounted for 20,000 tons or 0.3% of world production, all of which
was exported to Europe. In addition to world primary production, there are
small amounts of zinc scrap recycled, mainly in the USA.
4.11      World zinc production grew strongly in the 1960s, but stagnated in
the 1970s due to low demand as follows:

c/   Estimated.
4.12      In the mid-1970s, additional new production came on stream, including
two large mines at Tara, Ireland, and Rubilas, Spain, resulting in a worldwide
capacity utilization of only 80-85% in the late 1970s. Despite the closure of
several small mines and older smelters, considerable surplus capacity presently
exists, especially in European smelting capacity and in mine capacity of
developing countries.
2. Zinc Consumption
4.13      The major uses of zinc are as a protective coating for steel and in
die-casting production for automobile components. Construction and transporta-
tion account for over 50% of zinc consumption. These two industries are
extremely sensitive to business cycles, making zinc consumption very volatile
on a year-to-year basis. Other markets include the direct use of zinc as an
alloy in brass and bronze castings and the use of zinc oxides for ceramics,
paints, chemicals and rubber manufacture. But zinc is prone to substitution
because it is relatively heavy and has a low strength-to-weight ratio, and has
lost its market share in various uses to other materials such as aluminum and
plastics, especially in recent years.



- 18 -
4.14      Zinc consumption grew strongly in the 1960s, but growth rates
declined in the 1970s, especially in the industrialized countries where the
amount of zinc per automobile declined from 80 lbs in 1968 to 28 lbs in 1979.
Over 90% of the industrialized countries consumption is imported, compared
with 22% for developing countries. In the 1960s and early 1970s, CPEs were
net importers of zinc concentrates but exporters of zinc metal. However,
metal exports declined in the 1970s and in the late 1970s CPEs were net
importers of metal as well as concentrates.
3. Zinc Supply/Demand Balance and Price Prospects
4.15      Despite the present excess capacity in the zinc industry, many new
projects are planned or under construction, especially in areas with low
operating costs such as Australia and Latin America where many producers have
costs in the US$660-770 per ton range compared with US$880-1,100 per ton for
many older European producers. Industry estimates indicate a growth of as
much as 500,000 tons in annual zinc production capacity from 1980-85 mainly
in the regions with low production costs.
4.16      Prospects for future zinc consumption growth are limited.  Growth
possibilities exist in the areas of coatings for steel corrosion protection,
in builders hardware and in foundry uses. However, these markets are likely
to provide only modest increases in zinc usage. Also, the development of new
uses for zinc through thin-wall and one-sided die-casting only requires
limited quantities of zinc. Estimates of future long-term growth rates for
zinc consumption vary from 1.5-2.9% per year, except for IBRD Report 814/80,
which estimates 5.1% per year, as shown below:

1980       Chase Econometrics (United States)   1979-1990               3.1
4.17      This report estimates the future growth rate in zinc demand at 2.6%
per year from 1980-90. This forecast is based on estimates of annual demand
growth for different regions as follows: (i) 1.7% per year in US and Europe;
(ii) 3.5% per year in Japan; and (iii) 4.5% per year in developing countries.
Based on this estimate of demand and on the preceding assessment of supply the
outlook for zinc is that excess production capacity will persist and that
capacity utilization will be below 90% in the early-mid 1980s, if inventory
build-ups are to be avoided.

4.18      Most zinc is traded in Europe either at the producer price set by
European producers or at the LME price. The two prices are closely linked.
Like lead, zinc prices are very volatile with an average annual change of
plus/minus 18%. Zinc prices went through a peak during the demand boom in
1973-74 and subsequently declined steadily in the face of surplus capacity
and high inventories during the mid-1970s. However, production cutbacks by
producers resulted in consumption exceeding production in the late-1970s, and
prices increased from US$593 per ton in 1978 to US$900 per ton in 1981.

4.19      Production costs for new capacity are estimated at US$800-900
per ton in 1980 terms. In view of the excess capacity, it is expected
that zinc prices will remain around the lower level of this range in 1982.
However, as capacity utilization rates increase during the 1980s, it is
expected that prices will rise, reaching around US$900 per ton in 1985 and
US$960 per ton in 1990 (both in 1981 terms), by which time capacity and
consumption should be approximately in balance. This is lower than the most
recent IBRD forecast of US$1,090 per ton in 1990 (in 1981 terms), which is
viewed as an optimistic forecast since it is based on an assessment of in-
creased demand bringing production capacity and consumption back into balance
by 1985. The present report represents a more conservative view. As with
lead, the forecast is a long-term trend price and prices in any particular
year may be US$50-100 per ton above or below the trend depending on the
prevailing supply/demand balance.
C.   Market and Marketing of CADETAF-s Concentrates
4.20      CADETAF's lead and zinc concentrates are marketed by the sales
division of BRPM, which, on behalf of CADETAF, concludes annual contracts
with 3-4 lead smelters and 1-2 zinc smelters in Western Europe. The con-
tracts, in which the smelter purchases the concentrate--as compared to custom
smelting--have terms and conditions that are in line with the industry's
practice 1/ and do not contain any unusual clauses. Even with the proposed
production increases, CADETAF's production will be very small by market
standards. The structure of the European lead and zinc industry is such that
even in difficult market conditions, CADETAF can be assured of being able to
have its concentrates processed and sold, either to established customers or
through traders on the LME. This is true whether the concentrates are shipped
to the domestic smelter PZ or to European smelters. Further, CADETAF's
concentrates are well accepted because, from a metallurgical point of view,
they are simple ores and comparatively easy to smelt.
4.21      The ore is shipped from the port of Kenitra-Mehdiya, about 30 km
north of Rabat. Individual shipments for each of the three main ore types,
i.e., zinc-calamine, lead-galena both with about 60% metal content, and
lead-galena with 40-50% metal content, must average 1,500-2,000 tons, because
of vessel availability and customer specifications. The average time required
to accumulate the tonnage for a shipment is 3-4 months. Payment for the ore
is based on the average LME price (lead) or European Producer Price (EPP)
(zinc) of the calendar month following arrival at the port of destination.
1/   Lead:  Delivery is CIF European port.  The smelter pays 95% of the lead
content and 98% of the silver content above 30g/t, and deducts: (i) a
lead smelting charge that varies slightly with the lead price; (ii) a
fixed refining charge for silver; and (iii) a fixed crushing fee.
Zinc: Delivery is CIF European port. The smelter pays 85% of metal
content and deducts: (i) a smelting charge that varies slightly with
the zinc price; and (ii) a fixed crushing fee.



- 21 -
Upon presentation of the provisional invoice and freight papers for a particu-
lar shipment, CADETAF receives an installment of between 75% and 90%, depending
on the customer (smelter). The balance is paid after the invoice is finalized,
usually 2-3 months later.
4.22      In 1980, agreement in principle was reached between DOM, CADETAF and
the Moroccan lead smelter PZ, that in the future CADETAF will deliver lead
concentrates to PZ, which has recently expanded its smelting capacity from
35,000 tpy to 50,000 tpy. Located at Oued el Heimr near Oujda in north-
eastern Morocco, PZ is owned by several state enterprises (51%) and Zellidja,
S.A., a mining company of the Penarroya Group (49%). Delivery to PZ has two
important advantages for CADETAF. First, ore shipments can be smaller and
more frequent, thus reducing working capital requirements and financial
charges. Second, the time lag between ore purchase from miners and payment by
the smelter will be reduced from presently 5-6 months to 1-2 months, thus
decreasing CADETAF's exposure to metal price fluctuations. Terms and
conditions of the 1981 contract between CADETAF and PZ, which has been reviewed
by the Bank, are very similar to the existing contracts. However, delivery
of lead concentrates to PZ will not limit CADETAF-s marketing options. PZ's
annual contract offer will compete with those of other customers and CADETAF
will select the most advantageous one.
4.23      Recently a technical marketing problem has surfaced which, for the
time being, concerns only the zinc concentrate. Due to the lack of mechanical
crushing and grinding facilities, CADETAF's concentrates--both lead and
zinc--are coarse and of irregular grain size, i.e., 20-100 mm. The remaining
crushing and grinding required to feed the ore to a smelter is done by
CADETAF's customers for a fee of US$1.00-1.50 per ton. In September 1980,
CADETAF's only zinc ore customer closed down and the zinc ore had to be
stockpiled for about 6 months until it could be custom-crushed by several
mines in the vicinity of CADETAF, since all other prospective zinc customers
required that the ore be delivered in grains below 5 mm in size. In order to
make CADETAF independent from crushing facilities at the smelter and to
facilitate sale of the zinc ore, financing of a crushing and grinding unit
is proposed under the Project (para. 5.15).
V. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Objectives and Scope
5.01      The proposed pilot Project is designed to:  (i) permit the mining and
beneficiation of low-grade ores, leading to more rational mining and ending the
waste of deposits; (ii) increase production and productivity of the artisanal
miners; (iii) establish a sound geological basis for future artisanal mining;
and (iv) improve and extend CADETAF's services to the miners. The Project
will have to achieve these objectives in an environment where the decision to
produce is made by thousands of independent individuals. The Project, there-
fore, is also designed to test the miners' reaction to various components and



- 22 -
operating procedures, in particular their production behavior, to determine if
and how future assistance should be provided. Benefits from the Project will
not be limited to those miners with high average incomes. Practically all
miners will benefit from CADETAF's enhanced capacity to provide assistance.
In addition, about 50% of all miners, or 7,500 are expected to utilize the
beneficiation facilities, and another 10% or 1,500 will, in addition, take
advantage of mechanized mining equipment. As a result of the Project, the
production of lead concentrate is expected to increase from presently 8,000
tpy to about 20,000 tpy and the production of zinc concentrate from presently
6,000 tpy to about 13,000 tpy.
B.   Project Description
5.02      The Project, which will be implemented over a four-year period,
contains the following components:
(a) a mobile lead concentrator with a capacity to treat about
36,000 tpy of low-grade lead ore during 10 operating months;
(b) a mobile zinc concentrator with a capacity to treat about
29,000 tpy of low-grade zinc ore during 10 operating months;
(c) a crushing and grinding unit at Tizi N Firest to process coarse,
hand-sorted concentrates into a material with a grain size below
5 mm;
(d) mechanized equipment and mine works for 3 cooperatives, 6
miners associations in the Taouz sub-region and some 30 other
miners associations;
(e) establishment of a training mine as training center for the
application of new mining equipment and techniques;
(f) geological studies and works including a metallogenic
study, a geochemical survey and drilling and tunnelling
to investigate ore reserves;
(g) construction of four additional ore collection centers and
four additional sub-centers in areas where miners at present
do not benefit from CADETAF's services;
(h) additional workshop equipment for the existing and new ore
collection centers, including two mobile workshop units to
carry out maintenance and repairs;
(i) equipment for two ore assaying laboratories;
(j) a socio-economic study of the artisanal mining sector; and
(k) technical assistance (financial/management) to CADETAF.



- 23 -
Detailed technical data on the project components are presented in Project
File A. The following paragraphs describe the main project activities
and their expected results.
C.   Detailed Features
1. Mobile Lead Concentrator
5.03      The lead concentrator is a combination of the two main processes for
beneficiation of lead ore: gravimetric separation, based on the difference in
specific gravity between the mineral to be recovered and the waste; and
flotation which effects separation through application of chemical reagents.
The ore will first be treated by gravimetric separation, which will recover
the more coarsely-grained portion of the galena ore, and then by flotation
which will recover the galena fines and lead ore, occurring as cerussite. A
mobile plant has been chosen, because artisanal production in the immediate
vicinity of any given location is insufficient to ensure continuous full
capacity utilization, and road transport of untreated ore over distances of up
to several hundred kilometers to a central, fixed plant is commercially
infeasible.
5.04      The main components of the concentrator are:  a crushing and grind-
ing section, including screening; a gravimetric section; a flotation section;
a section to thicken and discharge the waste, as well as to recycle process
water; and a power generating section. Each section will be mounted on mobile
bases with wheels for haulage by tractor, which will be rented from ONT. The
sections will be interconnected by conveyor belts and hopper bins. Auxiliary
equipment includes a laboratory for assaying of the ore, a 1.2 m  front-end
loader and a 12-ton truck for ore transport. A detailed equipment list is
given in Annex 5. Regarding infrastructure, watertight tailings ponds will be
prepared to receive the flotation effluents.
5.05     3Both flotation and gravimetric separation require process water of
up to 5 m per ton of low-grade ore, two thirds of which can be recycled.
Water availability in all prospective concentrator locations has been verified
and confirmed by CADETAF.
5.06      The concentrator will operate on three shifts requiring 39 staff,
including one technician and 3 foremen, one for each shift. The technician
will be trained for two months at the supplier's plant, while foremen and
workers will receive on-site training by the supplier for five months.
5.07      Based on 36,000 tpy of low-grade ore feed at 10% Pb and a conserva-
tive metal recovery factor of 85%, the plant will produce 4,570 tpy of lead
concentrate at 67% Pb during 10 operating months per year. During its expected
lifespan of 15 years, the concentrator will consume an estimated 540,000 tons
of low-grade ore. At least 480,000 tons will come from proven reserves in
artisanally mined deposits, although it is likely that the reserves and thus
production will be higher. The remaining 60,000 tons will, to the extent



- 24 -
needed, come from about 300,000 tons of tailings and rejects presently stock-
piled in the region. About 200,000 tons of these come from former industrial
gravity separation plants. The other 100,000 tons are rejects from hand-
sorting or from low-grade ore unavoidably mined and then discarded at the
minehead.
5.08      The mobile concentrator will rotate among eight locations, i.e.
El Hawanit, Ksar Moghal, Beni Tadjit, Talsint, Tizi N Firest, Tiza, Iminohanou
and Taouz, as shown on the Map. In each location the concentrator will remain
for a period of 5.5 months, of which 0.5 months are assumed for relocation
activities (start-up, shut-down, transport) and five months for production.
After two locations, or eleven months, major maintenance and repair work will
be carried out during the twelfth month. The 4-year cycle has been chosen in
view of expected artisanal production and in order to distribute the con-
centrator benefits equitably. To move the concentrator, CADETAF will rent
tractors from ONT. The road connections between the locations are mostly dirt
roads, passable for trucks. Where required, CADETAF will carry out road
repairs necessary to move to the next location. Staff, housed in tents, will
relocate together with the concentrator, which CADETAF has assured will be no
problem.
5.09      To feed the concentrator, CADETAF will purchase low-grade ore from
the artisans at the rate of 375 tons per month and location, or 36,000 tpy.
To ensure full capacity utilization of the concentrator, each location must
have 15,750 tons of stock on the date the concentrator arrives. This implies
the build-up of stocks in each location over a 42-month period. The resulting
stocks to be maintained at any given moment are thus 63,000 tons. Until the
artisanal production accumulated in each location is sufficient to feed
the concentrator, CADETAF will utilize old mine tailings left over by foreign
mining companies in the 1950s (para. 5.07). The tailings will also serve as
back-up feed later if artisanal production were to fall below the expected
levels. Available in each of the eight locations, they total, as already
noted (para. 5.07), 200,000 tons, equal to about six years of feed, at 4-5%
Pb. Due to their low metal content, the tailings had no value previously and
were abandoned after being originally mined. Since these ore dumps will take
on a commercial value as a result of the Project, the question had arisen as
to whether they are owned by CADETAF, the Government or by the miners who have
the mining rights in the region. Recently Government has decided, that the
old mine tailings belong to the Government but CADETAF will be allowed to use
them as necessary and free of charge. The utilization of tailings and artisanal
production, as well as the build-up of ore stocks that CADETAF will have to
maintain, are shown below:

Artisanal production           12,000  32,000  36,000  36,000  36,000  36,000  36,000

- of which artisanal
production                    1,500   9,000  17,750  26,750  34,250  35,750  36,000
Low-grade ore stocks
from artisanal production  10,500  33,500  51,750  61,000  62,750  63,000  63,000
It must be emphasized that the production model above represents merely the
best estimate available and that actual artisanal production could be very
different. If it is lower, CADETAF will have to use more tailings. Should
miners, on the other hand, achieve and maintain much higher production rates,
then CADETAF will not be able to purchase all production for lack of capacity.
2. Mobile Zinc Concentrator
5.10      The zinc concentrator will preconcentrate low-grade calamine ore by
gravimetric separation to a metal content of 35%. After preconcentration, the
zinc ore will be further upgraded in CADETAF-s existing calcination facilities
(para. 3.04) to a marketable concentrate of 46% metal content. A mobile plant
has been chosen for the same reasons as the mobile lead concentrator (para.
5.03). The main plant components, as well as auxiliary equipment, are the
same as for the lead plant (para. 5.04), except for the flotation section,
which the zinc plant does not have. A detailed equipment list is given in
Annex 5. Also, watertight tailings ponds are not required because the process
water is not polluted but merely dirty. CADETAF has equally verified and
confirmed the availability of process water at each prospective location.
5.11      The plant will have a three-shift operation requiring 16 staff,
including one technician and three foremen, one for each shift. The technician
will be trained for two months at the supplier-s plant, while foremen and
workers will receive on-site training by the supplier for five months.
5.12      Based on 29,000 tpy of low-grade ore feed at 15% Zn and a conserva-
tive metal recovery factor of 80%, the plant will produce 9,940 tpy of zinc
concentrate at 35% Zn, representing, after calcination, 7,560 tpy of zinc
concentrate at 46% Zn. During its lifespan of 15 years, the concentrator
will consume about 435,000 tons of low-grade ore. Present production is
sufficient for the concentrator (para. 5.14), and reserves--while no systematic
assessment is available--are large. In addition, CADETAF has 87,000 tons of
its own all-grade zinc stocks at 7-30% Zn, which are rejects from former pur-
chases from the miners due to low grade.
5.13      The mobile zinc concentrator will rotate initially among two loca-
tions, i.e., Tizi N-Firest and Beni Tadjit (Map), adjacent to the existing
calcination facilities. Once CADETAF has constructed calcination ovens at El



- 26 -
Hawanit, that location will be added. Three locations are sufficient
for the zinc concentrator because the occurrence of zinc ore is limited to
these three areas. The sequence of relocation is the same as for the lead
concentrator (para. 5.08).
5.14      To feed the concentrator, CADETAF will purchase all-grade ore from
the artisans at the rate of about 1,200 tons per month in each of the two
initial locations, or about 29,000 tpy. Present production rates are com-
parable, i.e., 2,350 tons per month, assuming that for each ton of ore now
purchased by CADETAF of 35% Zn or above, an additional 2.4 tons were mined
out, but had to be rejected because of their low grade. To ensure full
capacity utilization of the concentrator, each location must have 8,350 tons
of stock on the date the concentrator arrives, and CADETAF must therefore
maintain a stock of 8,350 tons at any given time. During the first six
months--and as back-up reserve--CADETAF will utilize its own stocks of all-
grade zinc, equal to three years of feed (para. 5.12).
3. Crushing and Grinding Unit
5.15      The unit will consist of a jaw crusher of 10-15 tons per hour (t/h)
capacity, the necessary vibrating screens and conveyors and two 50-ton storage
bins, one for lead and one for zinc. It will produce ore of small and even
grain size at 5 mm or below.  A detailed equipment list is given in Annex
5.
5.16      The unit will treat all artisanal production of high-grade, hand-
sorted and hand-washed ore that is immediately marketable and thus bypasses
the concentrators. The unit will be located at Tizi N-Firest where 100% of
all zinc ore and 60% of all lead ore pass through directly. The rest of the
lead ore passes within 10 km of Tizi N'Firest.
4. Equipment and Works for Pilot Mines
5.17      Mining, tramming, hoisting and pumping equipment will be provided
to selected pilot mines. In some of the mines, CADETAF will in addition
construct collector drifts for underground transport of ore. The proposed
equipment is small, simple to operate and well within the present capabilities
of the miners. It also does not require large back-up maintenance facilities.
The main types of equipment and mine works are:
(a) hoists of swing-boom type with a 2-ton capacity and 130 m
hoisting depth, either mechanical or driven by compressed air;
(b)  compressors varying from 2.5 m /min to 12.6 m /min, but pre-
dominantly with 3.0 m /min. The larger compressors will be
installed in mines which require pumping and/or hoisting;
(c) jackhammers, weighing 11 kg and chosen to be easily handled
and held in position by one man, without mechanical support;



- 27 -
(d) mine cars of 500-liter capacity, running on 60-cm gauge track
of 9 kg/m rail. A turntable will be provided for each 100 m of
drift;
(e) pumps of the type already in use;
(f) light downhill aerial tramming equipment for miners on high
slopes or on top of mountains. This will cut down on mule
transport and on long truck hauls to the valley; and
(g) driving of 100 m foot wall collector drifts with cross cuts
and shafts for tramming and hoisting in each of six mines at
Taouz. These works will be carried out by CADETAF.
5.18      Equipment and mine works above are designated exclusively for lead
mines where the optimal mining method, as well as the appropriate equipment,
is readily determined due to the vein-type deposits being mined. The zinc
deposits, which often are cavity fillings, require more systematic exploration
by drilling to determine shape, size and content before the best mining method
and equipment can be identified. The geological work on the zinc deposits
(para. 5.25) will lay the groundwork for future assistance to zinc miners.
5.19      The recipients of equipment and mine works will be the three exist-
ing mining cooperatives, i.e., Hawanit, Skendis and Tamslamt, six miners
associations at Taouz and some 30 other mines operated by miners- associa-
tions or on a family basis. The cooperatives and the Taouz mines have been
selected by CADETAF based on the quality of deposits being exploited, the
level and continuity of production, and the technical experience of the
miners. The some 30 other mines will be selected according to appraisal
guidelines agreed with the Bank. The 39 pilot mines will be distributed
throughout the mining region and are estimated to provide the livelihood for
some 1,500 miners and their families. During the project implementation
period, assistance will be limited to these some 39 mines because of the pilot
nature of the Project and CADETAF-s implementation capacity. Starting in
1986, assistance will be provided to additional mines from repayments by the
pilot mines (para. 6.11).
5.20      Equipment and mine works will be made available in six different
packages, tailored to technical requirements and production levels of
individual or groups of mines; one for each cooperative, one for the 6 mines
at Taouz, one for 20 of the other mines and one for the remaining 10 mines.
The equipment for each mine category is given in Annex 5. The investment
involved has been estimated (in average 1983-85 current terms) at US$166,000
per Taouz mine, US$92,000 per cooperative, and US$30,000 per other mine.
5.21      Drilling is, and will be, done dry by hand-held drills in dry ground
and will produce dust. The introduction of wet drilling, which requires a
supply of water under pressure at the mine face, is beyond CADETAF-s power to
impose on the miners. The ground is calceous, so that the risk of silicosis
is small. However, CADETAF will consult a mine doctor regarding whether lead
or zinc sulfide dust can be absorbed through the lungs. If so, dust masks
must be provided and the miners be persuaded to wear them when drilling.

5. Training Mine
5.22      To familiarize miners with new equipment and mining techniques,
CADETAF will open up a training mine. The site selected is on the Ain
Dermchane vein in the Keba area, 10 km from Errachidia and close to the main
road. The mine will be equipped with 2 compressors, 2 jackhammers, a hoist,
200 m of track, 6 mine cars and timber for underground support. A detailed
equipment list is given in Annex 5. Underground supervision will be in the
hands of a foreman, two miners and two drillers, assisted by two laborers.
CADETAF's professional staff will give formal instructions where required.
Miners will be lodged in two big tents at the mine site. Board will be
provided by CADETAF.
5.23      Courses will focus on practical demonstration with the necessary
minimum of formal instruction. Each course will have about 10 participants
and last about 1-2 months to limit the miners absence from their own mines.
Under supervision of CADETAF staff, the trainees will actually develop the
mine and, at the same time, produce lead concentrate, the revenues of which
will help cover the operating cost of the mine and can be used to compensate
the participating miners for the income foregone from their own mines.
5.24      The areas in which miners will receive basic training include:
(i) operation, performance and maintenance of simple mining equipment;
(ii) execution of underground mine works; (iii) mining techniques; (iv)
blasting methods; (v) mine safety; and (vi) basic mine management. Not every
course can touch on all subjects, because the course content will be adapted
to the actual development work required at a given time. This will apply in
particular to mine works. In such cases, CADETAF will reschedule the
participants for a second course at a later time. CADETAF has agreed to
prepare its detailed training program in cooperation with the training section
of MEM and the Ecole Nationale de l'Industrie Minerale (ENIM). CADETAF will
(i) prepare the program, including the selection criteria for trainees, and
submit it to the Bank not later than September 30, 1982, for comments, and
(ii) promptly thereafter, implement said program, taking into account the
Bank-s comments thereon.
6. Geological Studies and Works
5.25      The geological program consists of 3 components:
(a) a metallogenic inventory of lead and zinc occurrences
throughout the mining region;
(b) a geochemical survey of several sub-regions predetermined by
CADETAF; and
(c) a detailed estimate of lead and zinc reserves in 3 deposits at
Taouz, 1 at Iminohanou, 1 at Hawanit, 1 at Ksar Moghal, 1 at
Dait, including about 600 m of tunnelling, 400 m of vertical
driving and 20,000 m of drilling.
A detailed equipment list as well as consultancy man-months is given in
Annex 5.

5.26      The metalloganic survey, which will cover the whole region, will
start from areas already being mined where data can be obtained most readily,
and then spread to the lesser-known areas. It will include surveying and
geological mapping to scales of 1:2,000 to 1:5,000 of geological units and
individual deposits, trenching and sampling, and possibly some pitting and
drilling. The survey will be carried out by consultants over a period of
three years. CADETAF will provide support staff, transportation, small
equipment and housing. CADETAF will present by March 31, 1983, terms of
reference including a specific time schedule, for comments by the Bank, and
consultants are scheduled to be hired by December 31, 1983.
5.27      The geochemical survey, which is the best method available to locate
blind orebodies of lead and zinc, will consist of the taking and testing of
about 2,200 samDles on 92 pre-selected alignments. The samples will be sent
to ENIM or BRPM in Rabat for analyses by X-ray fluorescence. Follow-up
underground exploration is not foreseen during the project period. If a
noteworthy anomaly were to be found, meriting immediate investigation, this
could be done with the light diamond core drill included under the Project
(Annex 5). Survey personnel includes 2 geochemists and 1 surveyor, assisted by
2 samplers (CADETAF). For the geochemical work CADETAF will employ consultants
whose selection, qualifications and terms and conditions of employment will be
acceptable to the Bank. Terms of reference prepared by CADETAF are scheduled
to be submitted to the Bank by June 30, 1983, and the consultants will be
hired by December 31, 1983.
5.28      Exploration work will be undertaken to improve the knowledge of the
lead and zinc reserves contained within individual deposits already being
mined. This work will involve surface geological mapping of individual
outcrops or groups of outcrops to scales between 1:250 and 1:500, accompanied
by systematic trenching, sampling and testing. Underground, the selected
mines will be topographically surveyed and mineralogically mapped to the same
scale as for the surface. Exploration along the outcrop length beyond the
present mining or below known levels will be done by drilling. A CADETAF
team, consisting of 1 geologist, 2 surveyors and 2 assistant surveyors will
carry out the program over a period of 2 years.
5.29      In the course of this program, CADETAF will acquire sufficient
knowledge to be able to predict the probable behavior of the ore ahead of the
faces with a reasonable degree of certainty. It can then agree with the
miners on annual production quotas from each face, which can be followed up
through the monthly deliveries made to the collection centers. This will
provide CADETAF with a tool to exert influence on artisanal production rates.
7.   Ore Collection Centers
5.30      CADETAF will construct four new ore collection centers at Iminohanou,
Tiza, Timgharine and Ait Hani (Map), i.e. in locations too distant to be
easily serviced at present from elsewhere. The centers will be equipped with
a warehouse for equipment and supplies, an ore receiving and sampling yard, an
office, a first-aid post, including anti-tetanus and anti-snake serum, housing



- 30 -
for the manager, two-way radio, a 2-ton platform weigh scale and a four-wheel
drive vehicle (for every two centers). A detailed equipment list is given in
Annex 5. In four areas, which support a large or developing artisanal popula-
tion and thus merit special attention, CADETAF will construct sub-centers.
They will be erected at Tamslamt, Skendis, Ksar Moghal and Hawanit and
will be smaller than the collection centers, but will have the same equipmenit
(Annex 5). The centers and sub-centers will be constructed by CADETAF
personnel at the rate of 2 per year. Having constructed the other collection
centers in the past, CADETAF is well qualified to do the work.
8.   Equipment for CADETAF's Technical Services
5.31      Laboratory Equipment.  CADETAF's existing two laboratories at
Errachidia and Erfoud have a combined capacity of 10,000 assays per year,
which is insufficient to process the some 20,000 assays per year that will
result from the Project. This figure excludes assaying for geochemistry and
metallogenics, which will be carried out under contract. To make up the
shortfall (10,000 assays per year), the collection centers at Tizi N-Firest
and Tadjit which already have facilities, but no equipment, will each be
equipped to handle 5,000 assays per year. A detailed equipment list is given
in Annex 5.
5.32      Workshop Equipment.  The mining equipment foreseen under the Project,
while of similar type to that presently in use, will more than double the
quantity to be maintained by CADETAF. It will also be spread more widely
geographically. The Project therefore provides for (i) equipment for each of
the three workshops in Errachidia, Beni Tadjit and Erfoud, and (ii) two mobile
maintenance vans, including equipment. Each maintenance van will have a crew
of 2 mechanics, 2 electricians and 1 driver.  A detailed equipment list is
given in Annex 5.
5.33      Surveying Equipment.  CADETAF-s surveying and drawing section will
be reinforced by 3 additional staff (para. 5.38) for whom 3 theodolites and 3
levels will be provided (Annex 5).
9.   Socio-Economic Study of Artisanal Mining Sector
5.34      To improve the data base for planning future assistance to artisanal
miners, the Project includes 6 man-months for a socio-economic study which
will include a survey of the main characteristics of the mines and miners
and provide an assessment of the impact of artisanal mining on the regional
and national economy. In addition, the study will assess CADETAF's impact
on the artisanal mining operations and make recommendations for future activi-
ties. To carry out the study, CADETAF will hire a qualified local consultants
CADETAF will prepare terms of reference to be submitted to the Bank for
comments by June 30, 1983, with contract signature scheduled for December 31,
1983.



- 31 -
10. Technical Assistance for CADETAF
5.35      The Project includes 36 man-months of consulting services for
CADETAF to design (12 man-months) and implement (24-man7months)>
(a) systems and procedures for management information, financial
accounting, cost accounting, budgeting, credit to pilot mines
(para. 6.10) and long-term financial planning; and
(b) analysis of CADETAF's financial organizational set-up, staffing
and identification of possible training needs.
The proposed services will help CADETAF to (i) determine possible additional
staffing and training needs in the financial area; as well as (ii) adjust its
accounting and planning procedures in light of the widened scope and complexity
of the activities under the Project. The program will be carried out over a
period of 18 months, with recommendations to be presented after 9 months,
followed by 9 months of systems implementation. Before implementation, the
consultants recommendations will be reviewed by CADETAF, in consultation with
the Bank, in particular with regard to staffing levels and training needs in
the financial area. To carry out the program, CADETAF will employ consultants,
whose selection, qualifications and terms and conditions of employment will be
acceptable to the Bank, and who will be hired by September 30, 1982. The
review mentioned above is scheduled for mid-1983.
11. Ecology
5.36      The single source of pollution under the Project is the effluents
from the flotation section of the lead concentrator, which contain chemical
reagents used in the process. The effluents will be held in watertight
tailings ponds until evaporated to prevent their entering the aquifer.
12. Mine Safety and Medical Care
5.37      CADETAF's technicians conduct periodic mine inspections and advise
on mine safety. Hard hats are required for the miners safety in the shafts
and tunnels, albeit not unfailingly worn. CADETAF also distributes masks to
be worn as protection against dust, particularly from blasting. As mentioned
in para. 5.21, a mine doctor will be consulted regarding the health effects
of drilling dust from lead and zinc sulfides and the necessity of strictly
enforcing mask wearing. Although mine safety is haphazard by industrial
standards, few accidents seem to occur. Six accidents were reported in 1978,
25 in 1979, of which 1 was fatal, and 4 during the first half of 1980. The
comparatively low accident rate is probably due to good rock conditions.
Underreporting is unlikely in view of the insurance benefits that miners may
expect (para. 3.14).

D.   Project Implementation
1.   Project :anagement and Trgnnfziation
5.38      Project managemeat will  be unde1sc-tatzen by CADETAF with technical
assistance from BRPM v(para. 2.03)   on the senior level, CADETAF has reinforced
its staff with a technical director, seconded from BRPM, who will remain
throughout the project implementation perriod and traiR one CADETAF staff (the
presert head of the geological section) to take over his position after
project completion.  CADETAF has also hilred a mechanical engineer to head the
maintenance section.  In the financial areaa, the present chief accountant will
act as financial director, assisted b; the cons ultants mentioned in para.
5,35.  in addition, CADETAF will hire and marn-tain in position at least until
the completion of the Project3 (i) not j; er than December 31, 1982:  one
geologis), two geologist technicians, G foreman instructor for the training
mine, tw-o geologist technincians. tt.vo surveyor technicians, an assayer and an
assayer technician, two credit agents, anad a chief statistician, and (ii) not
later than June 30, 1983-  a beneficiatio., engineer and two beneficiation
technicians.  Should the finarcial consultants' recommendations on staffing
levels and their review (para. 5.35) so indicate, CADETAF will also hire
additional staff for its financial department.
5.39      11PM will provide assistance mnainly in metallurgical testing and
flow-sheet design, engineering, procuremen..t, installation9 training of
personnel, and start-up for t!he concentrators and the crushing unit.  BRPM
will also assist CADETAF in procurement of eq-uipment for the other components
of the Pro ject, and training for the inn,  ructor of the training mine will be
undertaken in B2WTM's existing mines.    respective cotLtract with BRPM, on
terms and conditions satisfactory te   Ba nk, is a condition of effective-
ness.
5.40      Under the Project, CADETImF wi_l e,rotract for about 126 consultancy
man-months to carry out 'i) the metallogenic survey (para. 5.26)--36 man-
months; (ii) the geochemmical survey (para. 5.27)--42 man-months; (iii) the
socio-economic study of the ar--nsanal midning sector (para. 5.34)--12 man-
months; and (iv) technical assistance to CADETAF (para. 5.35)--36 man-months.
Approximately 50% of these are expected to be contracted from expatriate
consultants.
5.41      To handle credit in kind in the fiorm of mining equipment and works 1/
to be suDplied to artisanal mInes (para. 6O1), CADETAF will establish a
credit urnit  staffed W3th two qualilied credit agents reporting directly to
the financial director, by January 1, 1983. In addition to administering the
credit, thnle unit will also monitor the per-formance of the pilot mines. A
separate file will be kept for each oF the some 39 mLres indicating, on a
monthly basis, production tonnage and grade3 consumpttion of explosives, fuel
1/   Sinking of shafts and drivine of haaul tunnels by CADETAF.



- 33 
and spare parts, safety record, work interruptions caused by equipment failures
and other causes, and revenues from ore sales. Once established, this work is
expected to be routine and two agents should be sufficient to meet the workload.
The file of mines will provide a data base for a review of credit terms and
conditions scheduled for June 30, 1985 (para. 6.12). Over the medium term, it
will also provide information for the introduction of mine-specific production
targets that would be jointly agreed upon by CADETAF and the miners (para.
5.29).
5.42      To provide its management with regular and standardized information
on all important aspects of its activities, CADETAF will establish a statis-
tical unit, also by January 1, 1983, staffed with a chief statistician and
an assistant. The unit will base its work on the management information
system that the consultants will develop (para. 5.35).
2.   Implementation Schedule
5.43      The Project will be implemented over a period of four years.  The
implementation schedule, which is shown below, is based on CADETAF's physical
and institutional capacity to execute the various components or to contract
for them, and on suppliers' information regarding delivery time of equipment.
Accordingly, the concentrators have been phased, with start-up of the lead
concentrator on August 1, 1984, and start-up of the zinc concentrator on
November 1, 1984. The crushing and grinding unit has a high priority (para.
4.23) and will be purchased as quickly as possible; start-up is foreseen on
August 1, 1983. After initial contracting for all mining equipment, CADETAF
will install the equipment and carry out the mine works for the pilot mines in
annual tranches as follows: Cooperative Hawanit, two Taouz mines, 10 other
mines from July 1983 to June 1984; Cooperatives Skendis and Tamslamt, two
Taouz mines, 20 other mines from July 1984 to June 1985; and two Taouz mines
from July 1985 to June 1986. Equally, CADETAF will construct the eight
centers and sub-centers in four equal tranches of two per year.

35 -
6.02      The equipment cost estimates are based on delivered prices quoted by
suppliers in December 1981. Expenditures for civil works and the geological
surveys have been estimated by CADETAF, based on its own past and ongoing
construction as well as exploration activities. Consultants' costs include a
total of 60 man-months for foreign consultants to carry out the geochemical
survey (para. 5.27) and part of the technical assistance to CADETAF (para.
5.35) at an average total cost of US$13,500 per man-month. Estimates for
local consultants to carry out the metallogenic survey (para. 5.26), the
socio-economic study (para. 5.34) and part of the technical assistance to
CADETAF are based on an average total cost of US$5,000 per man-month.
6.03      Physical contingencies for equipment are estimated at 15% of the base
cost, except where number and type of equipment to be purchased has been
clearly identified and changes are neither expected nor warranted. This in-
cludes equipment for the pilot mines, the training mine, the geological program,
the collection centers and CADETAF's technical services. Physical contin-
gencies for the geological surveys, the socio-economic study and technical
assistance for CADETAF are estimated at 10%. Price escalation for all foreign
components is calculated on the basis of annual international price increases
in US$ of 8.5%, 7.5%, and 6% for 1982, 1983-85, and 1986, respectively.
Domestic costs have been escalated at 12%, 10%, 8%, 7.5%, and 6% for 1982,
1983, 1984, 1985, and 1986, respectively.
6.04      Incremental working capital requirements have been estimated for
t';e low-grade ore and concentrate stocks of the concentrators as well as for
the hand-sorted concentrate stocks of CADETAF itself (Annex 6-2). Fifteen
percent of the working capital is for stocks of hand-sorted concentrate, 5%
for the zinc concentrator and 80% for the lead concentrator. The high amount
of working capital for the lead concentrator (US$1.6 million) is a result of
the continuous purchases of low-grade ore in all eight concentrator locations
necessary to build up and maintain low-grade ore stocks of 63,000 tons. The
stocks are required to ensure that an adequate supply of low-grade ore from
artisanal production is built up prior to the arrival of the lead concen-
tractor in a given location. This must be equally ensured for the zinc
concentrator, but the required stocks, and thus the required working capital,
is much lower. Estimates are based on the projected ore purchase prices for
the different ore types and the relocation schedule of the mobile concentra-
tors (paras. 5.09 and 5.14). Working capital estimates for the concentrators
are also based on paying for low-grade ore with an 80% down payment at the
time of purchase and a final payment of 20% twelve months later (para. 7.22).
6.05      Interest during construction has been calculated at 11.6% on the
Bank loan which will be both lent to the Government and on-lent to CADETAF
for 17 years, including 4 years of grace (para. 6.07). During the grace
period, interest charges and commitment fee will be capitalized.
B.   Financing Plan
6.06      The financing plan for the Project during 1982-86 is the following:



- 36 -
Financing Plan
Equity                            US$ Million            %
Government Contribution              5.1                 34
CADETAF Internal Cash
Generation                         0.6                  4
Total Equity                       5.7                38
Debt
Bank Loan                            9.5                 62
Total Financing                   15.2               100
6.07      The financing plan is structured on the basis that CADETAF will
finance from its own cash generation part of the 1986 tranche of working
capital (US$0.6 million). The amount of working capital to be financed by
CADETAF in 1986 is about 65% the depreciation in that year. In addition, a
net income of US$0.50 million is projected for CADETAF in 1986 (para. 7.25).
Therefore the internal generation of funds to finance the last tranche of
working capital should present no problem for CADETAF. The financing plan
further stipulates that the Government's contribution will include the
financing of all remaining local costs. Government disbursements will be made
according to local project costs incurred by CADETAF, up to a total of DH 26.5
million. Under the current Five-Year Plan of Morocco, tranches of DH 10, 10
and 6.5 million are foreseen for 1982, 1983, and 1984 respectively, but these
will be adjusted to project requirements, projected at DH 0.3, 5.3, 11.5, 7.6,
and 1.8 million in 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986 respectively. It is
proposed that the guarantee fee normally charged by IBRD for its industrial
projects be waived since the loan proceeds go to an organization which operates
as an extension service rather than a commercial enterprise. The extension
service activities for which project funds are designated include ore collec-
tion centers, training mine, workshop equipment, etc. For the same reason,
the Government will carry the foreign exchange risk of the Bank loan.
6.08      Government will finance the local cost share of the Project and do
so in the form of budgetary contributions to CADETAF.
6.09      Regarding overrun financing, Government has agreed to ensure the
prompt availability of funds (foreign and local) and in a form acceptable to
the Bank to complete the Project, independent of whether the need for such
funds arises out of an increase in project cost or a shortfall in CADETAF's
internal cash generation. Project completion is defined as (i) the operation
of the lead and zinc concentrators and of the crushing and grinding unit at a
rate equivalent to 80% of their feed capacity for a period of three months,
and (ii) the delivery in full of mining equipment and works to the first 35
pilot mines.
C.   Equipment Credit Facility
6.10      CADETAF will provide credit in kind in the form of mining equipment
and mine works such as driving of 100-meter haul tunnels to the value of US$2.18



- 37 -
million to some 39 pilot mines which have been and will be selected according
to criteria acceptable to the Bank (para. 5.19). CADETAF will procure the
equipment and also carry out the mine works. Credit will be provided to (i)
individual mines; (ii) miners associations, registered as such with CADETAF,
with each member carrying joint responsibility; and (iii) mining cooperatives,
with the latter as formal debtor. The recipient mines will enter into a
lease/purchase arrangement for the equipment, with CADETAF holding the owner-
ship title until payment of the last installment. The credits will have a
maturity of five years, including one year of grace on the principal, and
carry an interest rate of 12%. The credits will be recovered in quarterly
installments through deductions from payments for ore deliveries from the
pilot mines or will be payable in cash. Since CADETAF controls the primary
marketing of the artisanal production, the credit risk is considered acceptable.
Moreover, the small number of recipient mines allows for effective supervision
by CADETAF and, since CADETAF will hold the title, the equipment can be
physically recovered in case of defaults. CADETAF has prepared a sample
credit contract which was reviewed and found acceptable by the Bank.
6.11      The credits will be made with funds from a Credit Facility, whose
resources will be (i) a portion of the Bank loan of about DH 8.71 million
(US$1.67 million); and (ii) Government contributions of about DH 2.66 million
(US$0.51 million).  The Credit Facility will be set up separately from CADETAF-s
other finances, and its resources will be non-transferable. It will be
operational by January 1, 1983, and operate in accordance with policies and
procedures satisfactory to the Bank as described in detail in Annex 6-3.
Within the maturity of the Bank loan (17 years) it will provide a revolving
source of funds to finance new mining equipment and works credits (5 years
maturity). Debt service from the mines will be allocated to service the loan
portion of the Facility's funding and for relending to new beneficiaries
(para. 7.29) CADETAF will administer the Credit Facility and bear its operating
costs. CADETAF will also appraise and supervise the credit recipients according
to guidelines agreed with the Bank. It is recognized that these guidelines
may have to be adjusted in the light of subsequent experience. Therefore, it
was agreed that CADETAF, not later than June 30, 1985, will exchange views
with the Bank regarding financing terms, appraisal and supervision guidelines,
thereafter making modificatins as may be needed. This date has been set to
allow for adequate feedback from the experience with the first two tranches of
pilot mines.
D.    Procurement
6.12      Procurement of local equipment, material and services not financed
by the Bank will be done through local competitive bidding, which is required
by Moroccan regulations if the contract value is above DH30,000 (approx.
US$5,800). CADETAF has previous experience in such contracting procedures.
6.13      The main Bank-financed equipment items will be procured through
international competitive bidding, representing approximately 70% of
total procurement value (of the Bank-financed equipment). The remaining
Bank-financed equipment will be procured through limited international
tendering, with the exception of some small equipment, mainly workshop
and laboratory items up to a total of US$0.25 million, which will be
procured through prudent local shopping. For limited international
tendering, quotations will be invited from at least three suppliers from
different member countries of the Bank and Switzerland. 1/ For the local
1/   For this purpose, Taiwan is also included.

shopping, CADETAF will invite quotations from three suppliers where possible
and will keep procurement records of these purchases for inspection by Bank
supervision missions. For procurement of Bank financed equipment, local
suppliers will enjoy a 15% preference margin. A detailed list of the equip-
ment packages is given in Annex 6-4.
E.   Allocation and Disbursement of the Bank Loan
6.14      The proposed Bank loan would be allocated as follows:

VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Introduction
7.01      This chapter first discusses the incremental production resulting
from the Project. It then examines the future financial position of the pilot
mines, incremental income for miners and the future financial position of
CADETAF, followed by the financial covenants. Subsequently, the Equipment
Credit Facility, reporting requirements, financial rate of return and major
risks are presented.
B.   Incremental Production of Lead and Zinc Concentrate
7.02      Additional production resulting from the Project has been estimated
as summarized below (Annex 7-1). The assumptions underlying the estimate are
discussed in paras. 7.03-7.06.

C.   Total Artisanal Production             36,205
a/   At full capacity.
b/   Including start-up and phasing out.
While projected production appears high for the artisanal sector as a whole if
compared with present production, artisanal production was 37,700 tons in
1972, 34,800 tons in 1973 and 35,200 tons in 1974, indicating that the produc-
tion potential for the Project targets exists. Production figures from
1972-74 also indicate that CADETAF can mobilize the infrastructure to handle
the projected ore volumes.
7.03      Concentrators.  Estimates for the operations are based on artisanal
low-grade ore inputs of 10% Pb and 15% Zn (paras. 5.07 and 5.12) to produce
lead concentrate of 67% Pb and zinc concentrate of 46% Zn. Both concentrators



- 40 -
are assumed to produce at 60% of available capacity during the first year (55%
for the first six months and 67% for the second six months), 75% during the
second year, 95% during the third year, and at 100% from the fourth year on.
This is a conservative assumption and is 15% lower in each of the first three
years than the average learning curve of 23 concentrators recently surveyed
for the Bank by Charles River Associates, a US consulting firm (Project File
B). The productive life of both concentrators is conservatively estimated at
15 years, or half the usual life span for a fixed-location concentrator, to
allow for the additional wear and tear resulting from repeated relocation.
7.04      Pilot Mines and Non-Pilot Mines.  Production increases of the pilot
mines, based on hand-sorted lead concentrate of 60% Pb, have been estimated
for different mine types according to the equipment to be installed, present
production levels, mine potential and best judgment. Over a 3-year period,
production is assumed to increase (i) for the cooperatives Hawanit and Tamslamt,
as well as the 30 other mines, by 30%; and (ii) for the cooperative Skendis
and the 6 Taouz mines by 50%. Incremental production from (non-pilot) mines
receiving equipment credit under subsequent lending cycles of the Equipment
Credit Facility has been estimated at 500, 1,000, 1,250 and 1,500 tons in
1986, 1987, 1988 and 1989 to 1994 respectively, based on the assumptions used
for the pilot mines and the amounts available for relending (para. 7.29).
7.05      Ore Collection Centers.  Additional production resulting from the
availability of CADETAF's services in previously unserviced areas with
presently very low production has been estimated by CADETAF, based on the
number of miners around the new centers and the production potential of known
mines in these areas. The concentrator-induced production of additional
hand-sorted lead concentrate for direct shipment is based on the assumption,
considered realistic, that mining of low-grade ore will be accompanied by the
finding of some additional high-grade material.
7.06      Erfoud Mines.  As noted, the pumping equipment presently installed
in the six Taouz mines selected under the Project is too weak to keep the
mines water-free down to 120 m depth as required in the future and thus will
be replaced. Since the equipment is still fully operable, it will be
reinstalled in four Erfoud mines, which have recently become inactive after
mining reached the water level at 40 m depth. Estimates for these mines are
based on past production levels.
C.   Financial Projections for the Pilot Mines
7.07      Mine budgets have been established for each of the three coopera-
tives, for one sample Taouz mine and for one other sample mine. Expressed in
real 1981 terms, the mine budgets show the additional net income accruing
to each miner as compared with estimated present income levels. The additional
net income per miner at full production averages DH 1,420 (US$273), represent-
ing and average increase of 23% over present income levels. Income variations
result from the different ores being mined (ore from the Taouz mines contains
up to 300 grams of silver per ton), the production increases estimated for
each mine category (para. 7.04) and the number of miners involved. A summary
of the mine budgets is shown below (Annex 7-2):

30 Other Mines          990                   1,296                          27
Total      1,519          Average  1,420                Average   23
7.08      Cash flow projections have been established for the cooperatives,
the Taouz mines and the other mines, separately for 1983, 1984 and 1985 on
the assumption that equipment loans will be made at the rate of 1 cooperative,
2 Taouz mines and 10 other mines in 1983; 2 cooperatives, 2 Taouz mines, and
20 other mines in 1984; and 2 Taouz mines in 1985 (Annex 7-3). The projections
demonstrate that the pilot mines can afford the credit terms proposed under
the Project (para. 6.10).
D.   Incremental Income for Miners from Sale of Low-Grade Ore
7.09      Revenues from the sale of low-grade lead and zinc ore to CADETAF
constitute largely incremental income to the miners, because the low-grade ore
is not mined out as such, but is a residual of the hand-sorting process for
the high-grade ore. The additional production cost is consequently very low,
estimated, in 1981 terms, at DH 31 (US$6) per ton each for lead and zinc ore.
At ore purchase prices, in 1981 terms, of DH 140 (US$27) for low-grade lead
ore and of DH 88 (US$17) for low-grade zinc ore, the incremental net income
from one ton of low-grade ore is DH 109 (US$21) for lead ore and DH 57 (US$11)
for zinc ore. Based on the assumption that low-grade ores will be purchased
(i) at the rate of 36,000 tpy for lead ore and 29,000 tpy for zinc ore; and
(ii) from an estimated 7,500 miners, the average incremental net income per
miner will be DH 744 (US$143) in 1981 terms; this represents an average
income increase of 57% over the miners income level in 1980 (para. 8.04).
E.   Future Financial Position of CADETAF
1.   Sales Revenues
7.10      Sales revenues are based on the metal prices as given in paras. 4.07
and 4.19; they have been calculated net of smelting charges for concentrates
grading 60% Pb from hand-sorted mine output, 67% Pb from the concentrator
production and 46% Zn for both hand-sorted mining and concentrator production.
Where applicable, the silver content of lead concentrate has been assumed at
175 grams per ton yielding, in 1981 terms, US$8 per troy ounce minus refining
charges.



- 42 -
7.11      The differential between gross and net revenues which CADETAF
will receive for its lead concentrate from the PZ smelter (para. 4.22) has
been assumed to be equal to what CADETAF presently receives. This is a
conservative assumption because transport cost to the domestic smelter
is likely to be lower than to Europe where CADETAF-s concentrates have to
be shipped now.
2.   Ore Purchases
7.12      Ore purchases are based on the production targets in Annex 7-1
and on projected purchase prices for each of six ore types produced by the
artisanal miners (Annex 7-4). The pricing formula applied to calculate
the projected purchase prices as well as the payment formula are described
in paras. 7.16-7.22.
3.   Operating Cost
7.13      Incremental Operating Cost.  Operating costs for the concentrators
have been estimated on the basis of the consultant report (Project File C) and
suppliers information. All other incremental operating costs are based on
estimates prepared by CADETAF, which were reviewed and supplemented during the
appraisal mission and updated in December 1981. Operating costs are assumed
to remain constant in real terms, except for fuel costs, which are projected
to increase by 1.6% p.a. in real terms until 1990, in line with present Bank
assumptions. After project completion, the incremental operating costs are
estimated as follows (Annex 7-5):

- 43 -
7.14      Projected incremental operating costs in current terms until 1990
are shown in Annex 7-6.
7.15      Operating Costs Without Project.  CADETAF's operating costs "without
the Project" for 1982 are estimated DH 4.0 million, including technical assist-
ance to miners of about DH 1.0 million, in line with the yield of the withholding
margin. After 1982, they are assumed to remain constant in real terms as all
incremental operating costs are being accounted for separately.
4.   Cost Recovery
7.16      Cost recovery under the Project is described in Annex 7-7, which
discusses in detail the future pricing and payment formulas for ore purchases
from miners, the allocation of CADETAF's withholding margin on the ore purchase
price among different cost categories, and the calculation of treatment fees
for certain services provided by CADETAF. Annex 7-7 also analyzes the impact
of the cost recovery policies on miners, indicating that the resulting ore
purchase prices should be acceptable to them. The paragraphs below summarize
the major aspects of Annex 7-7.
7.17      Treatment Fees.  Part of CADETAF's operating cost will be recovered
through treatment fees, which will be charged for use of the concentrators,
the crushing and grinding unit, the calcination kilns and the laboratory
services. The fees will be calculated so as to recover operating cost,
estimated replacement costs and financial charges at market rates on installed
cost, as well as working capital. Government has agreed that treatment fees
will be calculated and charged as agreed with the Bank (see Annex 7-7 for
details).
7.18      The projected fees for the different services are summarized
below (Annex 7-8):
Projected Treatment Fees
(DH/ton of Concentrate--Current Terms)
1982    1983    1984   1985    1987  11990
Concentrator Fee Pb               -       -       979   1,307   1,433   1,638
Concentrator Fee Zn               -       -       410     400      373      408
Calcination Fee                  113     125      137     147      167      198
Crushing Fee                      30      30       29      29       24       29
Laboratory Fee                    21      22       24      25       29       34
7.19      Withholding Margin.  All other costs will be recovered through
withholding margins of 25% on hand-sorted lead concentrate, and 10% on hand-
sorted zinc concentrate, low-grade lead ore and low-grade zinc ore. The
allocation of the withholding margin will no longer be at the fixed rates of
40% for technical assistance to miners and 60% for CADETAF's administrative



- 44 -
and investment costs because it has not worked satisfactorily in the past and
is no longer appropriate for the widened scope of CADETAF's activities.
Instead, annual operating, investment and technical assistance budgets will be
established based on CADETAF's actual financial results of the previous year,
and projections for the budget year.  Based on these budgets, the allocation
of the withholding margin will be set (and changed) annually by DOM.  It was
further agreed, that the budgets will be reviewed in mid-year, and, if
necessary, adjusted by DOM according to actual developments.
7.20      Payment Formula.  For hand-sorted concentrates, the monthly calcula-
tion of ore purchase prices, based on the LME price of the previous month will
be maintained (para 3.10). The concentrates will also, as at present, be
fully paid for at the time of purchase. Low-grade ore will be purchased at a
fixed annual price estimated in advance for a given year. Based on this
price, miners will be paid 80% of the ore value at the time of delivery. The
remaining 20% will be paid 12 months later. The final payment will be based
on the actual metal price and the technical performance of the concentrators
during the preceding 12 months.
7.21      The introduction of treatment fees, the changes in the withholding
margin, the preparation of operating, technical assistance and investment
budgets and the payment formula for low-grade ores have been discussed and
agreed upon with CADETAF and DOM. Under this arrangement, beginning July 1,
1982:
(i)  the treatment fees and new withholding margins for hand-
sorted concentrates as detailed in Annex 7-7 will be
applied;
(ii)  the specific allocation of part of the withholding margin
for investments and technical assistance to miners will
be determined on the basis of annual operating, investment
and technical assistance budgets; and
(ii)  treatment fees and payment formula for low-grade ores,
as detailed in Annex 7-7 will be applied for all purchases
of low-grade ore.
Until Project completion, changes in the pricing and payment formula as well
as the mechanism to calculate the user fees will not be made without prior
exchange of views and the Bank's concurrence.
7.22      In view of the pilot nature of the Project, the ore pricing and
payment formulas will be reviewed in mid-1984.

5.   Financial Projections for CADETAF I/
7.23      Detailed income statement, sources and application of funds and
balance sheet projections are given in Annexes 7-8 to 7-10. The major
assumptions underlying these projections are discussed below and further
detailed in Annex 7-11.
7.24      The projections are made in current DH through 1990.  They assume an
annual domestic inflation rate of 12% in 1982, 10% in 1983, 8% in 1984,
7.5% in 1985 and 6% in 1986-90. Annual international inflation, where
applicable, has been assumed at 8.5% in 1982, 7.5% in 1983-85 and 6% in
1986-90.
7.25      The financial projections for CADETAF are summarized as follows:

- 46 -
7.26      The financial projections indicate minor losses in 1983 and 1984.
The loss in 1983 results in a very small cash loss of DH 0.26 million (US$0.05
million), which CADETAF will cover with short-term borrowing from BMCE. The
loss in 1984 does not result in a cash loss. Therefore, financing problems
during this period are not expected. In later years, only modest profits are
projected for CADETAF. This is to be expected in view of the fact that the
ore pricing formulas recover cost, but pass on to the miners as much benefit
as possible. The debt service coverage ratio is satisfactory, rising from a
low of about 1.2 in 1987 when debt repayment starts in full to about 1.9 in
1990. Following the equity contributions from Government in 1982-85, the
long-term debt:equity ratio is projected at 61:39 in 1985 and 41:59 in 1990.
The current ratio is satisfactory for the projection period, rising from 1.2
in 1982 to 1.6 in 1984 once the concentrators are producing. The increase of
the current ratio to 9.0 in 1990 is a result of the excess cash that is
projected from 1986 on and which has not been allocated for new investments or
technical assistance to miners.
F.   Financial Covenants
7.27      To ensure maintenance of a sound financial position during project
implementation and to safeguard CADETAF's position thereafter, it has been
agreed that:
(a)  CADETAF's non-project investments and technical assistance
to miners under the investment and technical assistance budgets
(para. 7.19) will not be permitted to exceed in aggregate
DH 1.5 million (US$0.29 million) in any one year until project
completion without the prior approval of the Bank;
(b)  after project completion and until its accumulated reserves
exceed DH 5 million, (US$1 million), CADETAF shall not make any
investments, including CADETAF's self-constructed assets, nor
provide any supporting services to miners whose costs are not
recovered directly, in an aggregate amount exceeding 50% of its
income obtained during the preceeding 12-month period;
(c)  CADETAF will not incur any debt (i) until project completion
other than for the financing of the Project (paras. 6.06-6.09)
and (ii) thereafter if, after incurring such debt, CADETAF-s
debt:equity ratio would exceed 60:40 and its current ratio
would be less than 1.5;
(e)  CADETAF will furnish the Bank with Government-audited financial
statements for itself and the Equipment Credit Facility within
seven months after the end of the fiscal year; and
(f)  any changes in (i) the pricing as well as payment formulas for
both hand-sorted concentrate and low-grade ores, as described
in paras. 7.16 to 7.22 and Annex 7-7; and (ii) the mechanism
to calculate the user fees, as described in Annex 7-7, will
require prior Bank approval until Project completion.

G.   Financial Projections for the Equipment Credit Facility
7=28      Separate financial projections have been prepared for the Equipment
Credit Facility, because its finances will be separate from those of CADETAF
(para. 6.11). Credits, which will carry an interest rate of 12% p.a. and have
a maturity of five years including one year of grace on the principal, will be
disbursed in 1983-85, with repayment starting in 1984 and ending in 1990.
7.29      The projected sources and application of funds statement for
the Equipment Credit Facility are summarized below (Annex 7-12):

a!   Net of 1% defaults.
7.30      For the projection, a default rate of only 1% has been assumed in
view of the fact that all credit will be given in kind and, with CADETAF
retaining ownership (para. 6.10), the equipment can be physically recovered
in case of default. Subsequent re-lending after recovery from the pilot mines
will start in 1986 after the review of credit conditions scheduled prior to
June 30, 1985 (para. 6.11). For purposes of financial projections, the
initial credit terms have been applied during the whole period, although the
review to be carried out in mid-1985 may indicate that changes are needed.



- 48 -
H.   Reporting Requirements
7.31      During project implementation and until project completion, CADETAF
will furnish to the Bank (i) on a semi-annual basis, progress reports on the
Project and CADETAF's operations, including a report on the lead mines benefit-
ting from the Equipment Credit Facility; (ii) on an annual basis, CADETAF-s
proposed operating, investment, and technical assistance budgets as well as
information on CADETAF's ore selling agreements; and (iii) brief appraisal
notes on and copies of credit agreements with the beneficiaries of the
Equipment Credit Facility. CADETAF will also prepare and submit to the Bank,
not later than six months following project completion, a report on the
execution and initial operation of the Project.
I.   Incremental Financial Rate of Return
7.32      The financial rate of return for the pilot Project has been calcu-
lated on the basis of incremental cost/benefit streams shown in Annex 7-13 and
is 24%. The capital costs include the working capital for the concentrators
and CADETAF itself, as well as investments for the concentrators in 1988-91
to replace four-wheel drive vehicles, trucks, front-end loaders and pumps.
The working capital for the concentrators is assumed to be recovered in 1997
and 1998, i.e., at the end of the Project life. The cost streams further
include CADETAF's incremental operating costs, artisanal production costs
estimated at DH 165/ton of concentrate and artisanal labor costs. Incremental
artisanal labor input is required for the collection centers' production, the
pilot mines, the concentrator-induced production of hand-sorted concentrate
and the production of the Erfoud mines (para. 7.02). For the low-grade ore
production, no incremental labor is required because low-grade ore is not
mined out as such but is a residual of the hand-sorting process. To determine
the nominal labor force required to mine the incremental production, a norm
production of six tons per man-year has been estimated. The estimate is based
on production levels of miners' associations assumed to work continuously.
Nominal wages have been assumed at DH 6,600 per man-year, or about 50% above
the minimum wage.   The results are summarized below:

Operating Costs up 10%                               20
Selling Price up 10%                                 32
Selling Price down 10%                               16
Production up 10%                                    29
Production down 10%                                  19
Selling Price and Production down 10%                14
Selling Price down 20%                                9
Production down 20%                                  14
Selling Price and Production down 20%                 2
7.33      The resulting return is satisfactory in view of the fact that costs
and benefits have been calculated at the margin. The rate of return is most
sensitive to changes in the selling price and least sensitive to changes in
the capital cost. If artisanal production is 20% below the projections, the
rate of return would drop to 14%, which is marginally acceptable but under-
lines the risk associated with the production behavior of the miners. Lower
production due to technical difficulties is not likely because the production
assumptions are considered to be conservative. Artisanal production, however,
could--as it has in the past--drop 20% or more during periods of low metal
prices. On the other hand, artisanal production could also be considerably
above the projected production targets during periods of high prices. If
selling prices and production fall 15% below the projected levels, the
Project becomes marginal.
J.   Major Risks
7.34      The major risk that the Project faces is sudden and sharp decreases
of lead and zinc prices. Both metals have a history of strong cyclical price
movements with large deviations from long-term price trends. While the cycles
of low and high prices compensate each other over the long term, a sharp price
drop during the project implementation period, in particular 1983-85, would
discourage artisanal production which could result in incomplete recovery of
CADETAF's operating cost during that period. Project implementation, however,
would not be jeopardized as the Government has agreed to provide all funds
necessary to complete the Project (para. 6.09). For CADETAF, sharp and sudden
price drops also mean that it must sell the hand-sorted concentrate at a
lower price than purchased from the miners (para. 3.13). Delivery of lead
concentrate to the PZ smelter will considerably reduce the price risk that
CADETAF carries because the time lag between the date of ore purchase and
the reference date for the price to be paid by the smelter is reduced from
presently 4-6 months to 1-2 months.



- 50 -
7.35      The second uncertainty facing the Project is the miners- response
to the concentrators, the mining equipment and the modified pricing and
payment formula; this response cannot be predicted reliably. Miners could
decide that their present mining income is sufficient and can be maintained
with less production of hand-sorted concentrate, because of the opportunity
to sell low-grade ore. CADETAF, therefore, may have to make purchases of
low-grade ore conditional upon delivery of a certain amount of hand-sorted
concentrate. On the other hand, even with mandatory hand-sorted deliveries,
low-grade ore production could be so high that CADETAF may have to design
a selection mechanism for its low-grade ore purchases, which is equitable
and accepted as such by the miners. Production in the pilot mines is more
amenable to CADETAF's influence through supervision and technical advice.
Also, the pilot mines have produced regularly in the past. Changes in the
pricing formula have been kept to a minimum, and, as demonstrated in Annex
7-7, should be acceptable to the miners. However, as also mentioned in Annex
7-7, any change is likely to be viewed with a certain suspicion. Therefore,
the ore pricing formula will be reviewed in mid-1984 (para. 7.22) to determine
if adjustments are necessary.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Project Benefits
1. Foreign Exchange Benefits
8.01      One of the Project-s primary benefits will be the increases in
production, and thus in foreign exchange earnings, of lead and zinc exports.
Zinc concentrates will be exported and increase foreign exchange earnings
directly. Lead concentrates will be either processed at the local PZ smelter
in Oued el Heimr and exported indirectly in form of metal, or exported directly
(para. 4.22). For estimating the foreign exchange benefits, the FOB value of
both lead and zinc exports is assumed to be the metal value minus smelting
charges, sea freight and insurance. Foreign exchange costs are based on
(i) foreign capital expenditures, including interest during implementation
and replacement investments for ancillary concentrator equipment; (ii) interest
payments; (iii) incremental operating expenditures of CADETAF and the miners
for non-fuel consumables and spare parts, with an estimated foreign exchange
content of 50%; and (iv) fuel cost with an estimated foreign exchange content
of DH 1.0/liter of diesel, derived from cif cost of US$37/bbl of crude petro-
leum and 1,160 liters of diesel per metric ton. The foreign exchange surplus
projected to be generated by the Project is, in real 1981 terms, US$34.0
million through 1990, as summarized below and further detailed in Annex 8-1:

2. Other Benefits
8.02      As mentioned in para. 2.08, the lack of ore concentration facilities
has resulted in undesirable exploitation practices as miners tend to mine
merely the richest part of a vein. The installation of the two concentrators
will encourage miners to mine less selectively, thus increasing the amount of
recoverable ores and making better use of Morocco-s available mineral resources.
Similarly, the equipment provided to the pilot mines will permit bringing the
full production potential of these deposits on stream.
8.03      Through its limited but systematic geological program of surveys,
exploration and estimate of reserves, the Project will help to identify new
deposits suitable for small-scale mining operations and thus to maintain
artisanal production in the long run. The geological program will also
yield more reliable information on reserves, size and type of deposits.
Decisions regarding the selection of appropriate mining methods, necessary
equipment and mine organization can be based on this information, leading to a
more rational development of new and existing deposits.
B. Project Beneficiaries and Project Area
8.04      Project beneficiaries will be some 7,500 miners and their families,
for whom mining is a major source of employment and income. The average
income per miner in 1979, a year of very high metal prices for both lead and
zinc, was US$361, or about half the agricultural minimum wage. For 1980,
the average income was US$277 and for 1981 US$250, respectively, 24% and 30%
below 1979, due to lower lead prices. While the mining income is, in many
cases, supplemented by other resources, mostly subsistence livestock and
agriculture, the income levels of most miners and their families are estimated
to be well below the national average. This estimate is supported by the fact
that the average income of the pilot miners, who are thought to be in the
highest income group, was only about US$1,058 in 1981, 25% above the non-
agriculture minimum wage and about equal to the salary of CADETAF's night
guards and messengers. A more detailed analysis of the miners- income levels
is presently not possible due to the lack of data, particularly on non-mining
income. To provide such data is among the objectives of the proposed socio-
economic study of the artisanal mining sector (para. 5.34).



- 52 -
8.05      Project benefits in the form of additional income from selling
low-grade ores and from increased production of hand-sorted concentrates
will accrue to all 7,500 miners. The majority of tangible project benefits,
i.e., those resulting from the sale of low-grade ore, will accrue equitably to
all these 7,500 miners, as CADETAF will purchase low-grade ore from as many
miners as possible. Benefits from the new ore collection centers, representing
7.4% of all incremental income will accrue to some 1,000 miners (among the
7,500), who are thought to be in the lowest income group since their present
production, and consequently income, are very low due to the irregular avail-
ability of CADETAF's extension services. Benefits from the mining equipment
for the pilot mines, representing 19% of all incremental income, will accrue
to some 1,500 miners who are in the highest income group.
8.06      Miners who do not directly benefit from the Project will be only
marginally affected by the new pricing formula (Annex 7-7) and will be able
to continue mining as at present, producing a fully competitive product.
8.07      Artisanal mining activities are mostly located in semi-arid and
arid areas which offer very limited alternatives for economic development,
aside from oasis agriculture, where water and soil conditions permit. Located
in the south-central and eastern economic regions, these areas have also been
bypassed by previous development programs with the result that they are poorly
endowed in basic physical and social infrastructure. 1/ Development of the
mining potential is therefore important, not only to stimulate economic
development, but also to prevent a deterioration of living conditions and,
eventually, depopulation and increased migration pressures on urban and rural
areas in other parts of Morocco.
C. Incremental Economic Rate of Return
8.08      The economic return has been calculated from the financial cost/
benefit streams which have been amended to: (i) eliminate all identifiable
taxes and subsidies in the capital and operating costs; and (ii) exclude the
export tax on lead and zinc concentrates (para. 3.10). Incremental economic
cost/benefit streams are shown in Annex 8-2.
8.09      The base economic rate of return, shown below, is 32%.  If artisanal
production drops 20% below the projected target, the rate of return is 25%.
If selling prices are 20% lower than projected, the rate of return is 15%;
however the probability of this event is considered to be low as the metal
price assumptions for both lead and zinc are more conservative than the
estimates of the Bank's Commodities Staff.

IX. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      The following agreements have been reached:
a.   With the Government
(i) that it will carry the foreign exchange risk of the Bank loan
(para. 6.07);
(ii) that it will ensure the prompt availability of appropriate funds
to complete the Project in the event of overrun financing being
required (para. 6.09);
(iii)  that new pricing formulae will be used for hand-sorted concen-
trates and low-grade ores (paras. 7.16-7.22 and Annex 7-7)
starting October 1, 1982;
(iv) that the percentage of the withholding margin ear-marked
for CADETAF's administrative and investment costs will be
set (and changed) annually by DOM, based on annual budgets
for CADETAF's operating, investment, and technical
assistance costs; further that the budgets will be
reviewed in mid-year and, if necessary adjusted by
July 31 (para. 7.19);
(v) Until project completion, not make any changes in
the pricing and payment formulas for either handsorted
concentrates or low-grade ores, or the mechanism to
calculate the user fees, without prior Bank concurrence
(para. 7.21); and

PILOT PROJECT FOR SMALL-SCALE MINING
GLOSSARY OF MINING TERMS
Calamine                  A generic term used for secondary zinc carbonates,
oxides and silicates, normally with a 50-55% Zinc
content.
Fracture Filling Deposit The deposit of ore, geologically formed over a
long period, in a broken surface of a rock or a
cleavage.
Galena                    A term used for lead sulfide, PbS, the most common
ore of lead, containing 86.6% lead.
Geochemical Survey        A survey involving the geochemical analysis of
systematically collected samples of rock, soil,
plants or water.
Metallogenic Survey       A survey involving the study of the origin of an
ore deposit and concentration of particular metals,
or of a particular metal type.
Mine Gallery              A horizontal or nearly horizontal underground
passage or tunnel in a mine.
Mine Shaft                An excavation of limited area compared with its
depth, made for finding or mining ore, raising
water, hoisting and lowering men and material,
or ventilating underground.
Mine Tailings             The parts, or part, of the ore separately treated
as inferior in quality or value. In mining, it is
also defined as the residuum after most of the valu-
able ore has been extracted.
Ore Concentrator          The plant in which--by the aid of water and specific
gravity--low-grade ore is concentrated into a higher
grade. Ore concentration may also be performed in
this plant by using chemical reagents via the
flotation method in which a froth, created in water
by chemical reagents, floats some finely-crushed
minerals, whereas other minerals sink.

ANNEX 1

Ore Reserve               The term is usually restricted to ore oF which
the grade and tonnage have been established with
reasonable assurance by drilling and other means.
Out-Croppings             This term is applied to a rock or ore vein as
seen exposed on the surface.
Possible Reserves         A class of ore, the existence of which is a
reasonable possibility, based primarily upon the
strength and continuity of geologic-mineralogic
relationships and upon the extent of ore deposits
already developed. Because of the comparative
absence of mine workings which could reveal assay
values, possible ore cannot be assigned a grade
with any certainty, nor can the quantity be
expressed as a definite, absolute amount.
Probable Ore              A class of ore, the occurrence of which is, for
all essential purposes, reasonably assured, but
not absolutely certain. A definite grade can
be assigned to the tons thus classified.  Probable
ore, however, is not amenable to immediate mining,
although the probable ore could, through develop-
ment work, become mineable in a relatively short
time.
Proven Reserves           Ore deposits which have been reliably established
as to their volume, tonnage and quality by approved
sampling, valuing and testing methods.
Tramming                  To haul ore with a carrier that travels on an
overhead cable or on rails.
Vein Deposit              Usually narrow and steeply inclined zones of
mineralized rock lying within boundaries clearly
separating them from non-mineralized rock.

1.       Establishment and Resources.  CADETAF shall establish, effective
January 1, 1983, a unit, staffed with the two credit agents referred to in
para. 5.41, in charge of operating the Equipment Credit Facility (the
Facility) for the financing and provision of equipment and mine works to
selected beneficiaries according to the policies and procedures set forth
hereunder. CADETAF shall initially fund said Facility out of the Govern-
ment contribution in an estimated amount of DH 2.66 million (US$0.51 million)
and the proceeds of the Bank Loan relent to it, in an estimated total amount of
DH 8.71 million (US$1.67 million).
2.      Credit Contract.  CADETAF shall provide any financing for equipment
and mine works under leasing-purchasing arrangements, on terms whereby CADETAF
shall obtain by written contract, in form and substance satisfactory to the
Bank, with any beneficiary, rights adequate to protect the interests of the
Government, the Bank and CADETAF, including the right of CADETAF to:
(a)  require the beneficiary to exploit his mine with due
diligence and efficiency and in accordance with appropriate
financial, engineering and mining practices;
(b)  require that the goods to be financed out of the Facility
shall be used exclusively for production in the beneficiary
mine;
(c)  inspect, by itself or jointly with representatives of the
Government and the Bank, if the Government or the Bank shall
so request, such goods, the sites, works and operations of
the beneficiary, and any relevant records and documents;
(d)  require the beneficiary to maintain the equipment and mine
works provided to it, and promptly to make all necessary
repairs or renewals thereof, in accordance with appropriate
engineering and mining practices;
(e)  obtain all such information the Government, the Bank
or CADETAF shall reasonably request relating to the fore-
going and to the operations and financial condition of the

under leasing-purchasing arrangements and the estimated
cost thereof, the name and status of the beneficiary, and
verifying that eligibility criteria determined in agreement
with the Bank have been met;
(b)  approve the financing of equipment and mine works to be
provided to any said beneficary in an amount determined
pursuant to paragraph 4 (a) and (b) hereunder and any further
financing referred to in paragraph 4 (g) hereunder; and
(c)  promptly thereafter, until the completion of the Project,
forward to the Bank the appraisal notes referred to in
sub-paragraph (a) above and copies of the contract entered
into between CADETAF and the beneficiaries.
4.        Amount and Terms of Financing.
(a)  The amount of financing shall be the equivalent in Dirhams
of the cost for equipment and mine works to be provided to
each beneficiary according to packages determined, until
the completion of the Project, in agreement between the Bank
and CADETAF and procured by CADETAF;
(b)  The estimated amount of financing for the first 39
beneficiaries of the Facility shall be the equivalent in
Dirhams of the following amounts or such other amounts as
may be agreed between the Bank and CADETAF:
(i) about US$92,000 each, for three mining cooperatives;
(ii)  about US$166,000 each, for about six miners  associa-
tions; and
(iii) about US$30,000 each, for about 30 individual
miners or miners associations, each operating one
mine;
(c)  In the case that the equipment and the mining works to be
financed out of the Government-s funds and of the proceeds of
the Loan shall require a change and as a result thereof the
amount of financing to be provided shall exceed 25% of any
of the estimated amounts set forth in sub-paragraph (b) above,
CADETAF shall provide the Bank with a justification for said
change and obtain its approval thereon.

ANNEX 6-3
Page 3 of 3
(d) CADETAF shall provide any financing for a term of five
years, including one year of grace on the principal,
at a rate of interest of 12% per annum on the principal
amount outstanding from time to time, with repayment terms
of principal and interest in quarterly installments
through deductions from payments for ore deliveries
by the beneficiary or payable in cash;
(e) A benefiary shall have the legal title to the equipment pro-
vided to him only upon the full repayment of the financing;
(f) In the case that a beneficiary is a miners- association:
CADETAF shall ensure that the miners' association is duly
established as an entity and entrusted with appropriate res-
ponsibilities under the Borrower's laws which, inter alia,
permit the entering into a written agreement with CADETAF
and enable its members to be jointly and severally responsible
for the repayment of the financing; and
(g) CADETAF shall use the proceeds of repayments of principal
and interest made by the beneficiaries with respect to the
financing provided to them by the Facility in the following
order of priority: (i) servicing the proceeds of the
portion of the Bank Loan allocated to it as set forth in
para. 1 and (ii) financing and providing additional
equipment and mine works to beneficiaries mentioned in
para. 4 (b) as well as other beneficiaries selected
pursuant to para. 3 (a) above.
5.        Supervision.  CADETAF shall closely monitor the performance of the
beneficiaries and make periodic visits to the mines operated by said benefi-
ciaries. CADETAF shall prepare regular evaluation and supervision reports
based on guidelines to be determined in agreement with the Bank.
6.        Not later than June 30, 1985, or such other date as the Bank and
CADETAF may agree, CADETAF shall exchange views with the Bank on the contents
of the appraisal for beneficiaries, the terms of financing and the guidelines
for supervision, and promptly thereafter make any modifications thereon as they
may be agreed between CADETAF and the Bank.

PILOT PROJECT FOR SMALL-SCALE MINING
COST RECOVERY
1.        Summary.  Previously CADETAF has purchased only high-grade ores
suitable for direct use as a concentrate and has deducted 25% of the purchase
price of the concentrate from the payment made to the miners in order to cover
its operating costs and to provide for technical assistance and investments
for the mining operations. As a result of the Project, CADETAF will now be
able to purchase low-grade ores in addition to continued purchases of high-
grade ores. The low-grade ores will require processing and treatment by
CADETAF to produce concentrates. A schedule of charges for treatment, etc.,
of the low-grade ore has been agreed with CADETAF. These charges include full
recovery of costs including charges on net fixed assets and interest.
Associated with the introduction of these charges, it is also proposed that
instead of the present system which requires that a fixed proportion of the
25% of the ore purchase price be withheld by CADETAF for technical assistance
and investments, CADETAF will introduce a budget system to determine the
annual level of assistance and investments outside the scope of the Project.
This change should strengthen CADETAF's financial stability and stabilize
CADETAF's technical assistance/ investment assistance.
2.        Ore Pricing Formula for Purchases from Miners:  The present ore
pricing formula, which provides for a withholding margin of 25% on the ore
purchase price to cover CADETAF's operating expense and technical assistance
to miners (para. 3.10) would not generate enough revenues to recover the
incremental operating cost and capital expenditures under the Project. The
two principal options are: (i) to increase the withholding margin across the
board; or (ii) to levy treatment fees for specific services. While recognizing
that any upward change of the pricing formula is a sensitive matter, the
second option has been agreed with CADETAF because (i) it is equitable in that
those miners benefiting directly from certain project activities will support
the resulting additional charges; and, related to that (ii) it minimizes the
impact on miners who benefit only marginally from project activities.
3.        The ore pricing formula to be applied in the future will therefore
include, as applicable for the different ore types, calcination, crushing,
concentrator and laboratory fees, while lowering the withholding margin to 10%
for certain ore types to compensate for the introduction of treatment fees
presently not charged. The changes are shown in the table below:

4.        Where the old and the new formulas can be directly compared, i.e.,
for hand-sorted lead and zinc concentrates, the new pricing formula will, when
introduced in 1982, result in the following relative decreases of the ore
purchase prices paid to the miners: 3.5% for lead concentrate with silver,
4.1% without silver, and 8.8% for hand-sorted zinc concentrate. In absolute
terms, however, the projected current 1982 purchase prices, calculated accord-
ing to the new formula, will still be above the current 1981 prices calculated
according to the old formula: 8.5% for lead concentrate with silver, 9.3%
without silver, and 6.6% for hand-sorted zinc concentrate. This is considered
acceptable to the producers of hand-sorted lead concentrate, among whom will be
the majority of those miners whose direct benefits from the Project are
expected to be marginal. For the producers of hand-sorted zinc concentrate,
this is also considered to be acceptable because zinc prices are projected to
increase in real terms at an average rate of 1.0% p.a. until 1990. Also, most
producers of hand-sorted zinc concentrate will regularly benefit from the zinc
concentrator.
5.        Under the proposed pricing formula for low-grade ores, projected
current purchase prices for 1984, the first year of low-grade ore purchases,
are DH 185/t for low-grade lead ore with silver, DH 153/t without silver, and
DH 107/t for low-grade zinc ore. At an estimated production cost of DH 40/t of
low-grade ore, between 63% and 78% of the revenues from low-grade ore constitute
net incremental income to the miners, providing a strong production incentive.
6.        Ore Payment Formula.  Hand-sorted concentrates will, as at present,
be fully paid at the time of purchase, whereas low-grade ores will be paid in
two installments, 80% at the time of purchase and the remaining 20% twelve
months later.  This is necessary to reduce the amount of working capital
required for the concentrators as well as the price risks that CADETAF must
carry between purchase of low-grade ore and concentrate sales. The payment of
low-grade ore in two installments is considered acceptable to the miners
because of the largely incremental nature of this income.



- 80 -
ANNEX 7-7
Page 3 of 4
7.        For hand-sorted concentrates, the monthly calculation of ore pur-
chase prices, based on the LME price of the previous month, will be maintained.
Low-grade ore will be purchased at a fixed annual price, which CADETAF will
estimate for a given year, and the 80% down payment at the time of ore
purchase will be made against this estimated price. At the end of each year,
CADETAF will establish the actual average price, based on actual metal prices,
and on the technical performance of the concentrators. Payment of the
remaining 20% will be based on this actual price.
8.        Allocation of Withholding Margin.  The present ore pricing formula
stipulates that the 25% withholding margin be allocated as follows: 15% to
cover administrative costs (10%) and investments (5%), and 10% for technical
assistance to miners. This allocation is unrealistic because it assumes that
CADETAF's administrative cost can be manipulated according to the prevailing
level of ore purchases and the resulting theoretical margin for administrative
cost. The allocation further assumes that CADETAF's administrative costs can
be held at or below 10% of ore purchases under normal circumstances, which in
practice has never been the case as, even in good years, administrative costs
have been at 12% to 14%. Also, the correct allocation of cost to one of the
three categories is, in practice, difficult to determine, particularly regarding
staff resources, and is thus open to judgment. Therefore, and in view of the
new withholding margins (para. 3) the allocation of the withholding margin
will be determined according to annual operating, investment and technical
assistance budgets. They will be based on CADETAFs actual financial results
of the previous year and projections for the coming year. DOM, responsible
for all changes in the pricing formula (the "Bareme d-Achat") will then set
(and change) the percentage allocation of the withholding margin on an annual
basis. It was further agreed, that the budgets will be reviewed in mid-year,
and, if necessary, adjusted by July 31 to reflect actual developments during
the first six months. This will assure that investments and technical assist-
ance are planned on a realistic basis, and thus are likely to be carried
out.
9.        Cost Recovery Through Treatment Fees.  The treatment fees for the
two concentrators and the crushing and grinding unit will be calculated as
follows:
(a)  Operating Cost.  CADETAF will establish an annual operating
budget for each of the three cost centers based on the operat-
ing cost of the previous year and expected cost increases for
the year for which the budget is prepared.
(b)  Replacement Charge.  Replacement costs will be calculated
for each facility based on actual installed cost inflated
over 15 years at a compound escalation rate of 5% p.a.,
representing a compounding factor of 2.079. Annual replace-
ment charges will be 5% of replacement cost in each of the
first five years, 6.7% in each of the following five years and
8.3% in each of the last five years, thus recovering the
full amount of estimated replacement cost. The lower charge
at the beginning is intended to contribute to attractive
current ore purchase prices during the initial years. Under
the above formula above, installed cost will be recovered after
8.5 years.



- 81 -
ANNEX 7-7
Page 4 of 4
(c)  Financial Charge on Fixed Assets.  An annual charge will be
calculated for notional interest on net fixed assets, i.e.,
installed cost minus accumulated replacement charges. The
interest rate applied will be 11%, which is the effective
rate that BNDE charges on medium and long-term loans for
industrial projects.
(d)  Financial Charge on Working Capital (for concentrators only).
An annual charge will be calculated for notional interest
on working capital. For practical purposes, working capital
will be defined as the average stocks of low-grade ore and
processed concentrate, which constitute most of the working
capital of the concentrators. The interest rate applied in a
given year will be the one applicable to short-term loans in
Morocco.
The fees thus charged the miners will not only recover operating and installed
cost, but also financial charges at market rates on all capital expenditures
and therefore contain no subsidy element. Recovering estimated replacement
costs of fixed assets will strengthen the self-financing capacity of CADETAF
with regard to future investments, in particular since no sinking fund
provision is included in the replacement charge.
10.       The treatment fees for the concentrators and the crushing unit will
be calculated on a per ton basis according to expected output. The concen-
trator fees during the start-up period, i.e. 1984 and 1985, will be based on
output at full capacity to avoid a distorted introductory price when low-grade
ores are first purchased.
11.       The calcination fee will be calculated on the basis of an annual
operating budget for the calcination facilities, which will include main-
tenance work on the kiln such as refractory relining. No other charges will
be included because the kilns, as self-constructed assets, have been fully
depreciated during construction.
12.       The laboratory fee will be calculated on the basis of an annual
operating budget. No other charges will be included.
13.       Cost Recovery Through Withholding Margin.  All other operating
costs, capital expenditures and financial charges will be recovered through
CADETAF-s withholding margin of 25% on the purchase price for hand-sorted lead
concentrate and of 10% on the purchase price for low-grade ores and hand-sorted
zinc concentrate (para. 3).
