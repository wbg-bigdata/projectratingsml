REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH FOR RE-LENDING TO
THE BANGLADESH SHILPA BANK
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for the equivalent of US$25
million on standard IDA terms, for re-lending to the Bangladesh Shilpa Bank
(BSB) to assist in the development of industry. The proceeds of the credit
would be relent to BSB for 18 years including 3 years of grace, at 9% interest.
PART I - THE ECONOMY!/
2.        A Basic Economic Report on Bangladesh, entitled "Bangladesh:
Development in a Rural Economy" (Report No. 455b-BD dated September 15,
1974) was distributed to the Executive Directors on October 1, 1974. An
updating report entitled "Bangladesh: Current Economic Performance and
Short-Term Prospects" (Report No. 1038-BD, dated March 22, 1976) was dis-
tributed on March 29, 1976. Annex I contains country data sheets.
Background
3.        The Basic Economic Report describes the obstacles to development
in Bangladesh and outlines a course of action to maximize the country's
limited development prospects. The high ratio of population to natural re-
sources, the slow development of the productive and infrastructural base and
the weaknesses of the administrative and institutional framework led the Re-
port to project a growth rate of GDP of between 2% and 3.5% per year in real
terms over the five years 1973-78, the variations within that range depend-
ing on the appropriateness of the policy framework and on levels of aid.
4.        Encouraging progress was made in the period immediately following
Bangladesh's independence as an enthusiastic Government, supported by mas-
sive external assistance, strove to overcome the devastation of the cyclone
of 1970 and the struggle for independence in 1971. Large amounts of food
aid were distributed, refugees were resettled and vital port, road and rail
facilities were brought back into operations. A new constitution was adopted,
and the first national elections, held in-March 1973, brought Sheik Mujibur
Rahman's Awami League party into power with an overwhelming parliamentary
majority.
5.        Overall economic progress since independence, however, has been
inadequate. Agricultural output remains insufficient for a population growing
1/   Part I is substantially the same as in President's Report and Recommend-
ation on Bangladesh - Technical Assistance Project CD 622-BD, Report
No. P-1768-BD.

at 3% a year. Industrial output, heavily dependent on imports, has been
badly affected by scarcity of foreign exchange. State enterprises have been
hampered by management deficiencies, excessive government controls, shortages
and price regulation. Exports have been stagnant and barely finance a quarter
of import needs. Bangladesh has been severely affected by an adverse shift
in its terms of trade since 1973. Trade problems are compounded by dependence
on annual food imports of 1-2 million tons, even in years of favorable weather
and by heavy reliance on imported industrial raw materials. Government
revenue has been insufficient to meet current and development expenditure
needs. Bangladesh has had to depend on large flows of external assistance
to meet the wide gap between national output and expenditure.
6.        On August 15, 1975 a military coup ousted the government of Mujibur
Rahman replacing him as President with Khondaker Mushtuque Ahmed, formerly
Minister of Commerce and Foreign Trade. However, events beginning on Novem-
ber 31, 1975, culminated in further political changes. President Ahmed
resigned in favor of a former Chief Justice of Bangladesh, A.S.M. Sayem.
Martial law is in effect countrywide, with the new President serving as Chief
Martial Law Administrator. The three chiefs of the defense services are
serving as Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrators. The three Deputy Martial
Law Administrators and seven civilians have been appointed to form a President's
Advisory Council and each of the members has a responsibility for one or more
ministries. The new government has confirmed that it intends to introduce
economic reforms such as subsidy reduction, agricultural taxation and import
liberalization. Whatever its longer-term objectives and orientation might
be, however, the fundamental problems of the country, namely over-population,
weak administration, inadequate infrastructure and insufficient reserves
continue to confront Bangladesh.
Current Economic Picture
7.        Given this background of fundamental weaknesses in economic struc-
ture, inadequate economic progress since independence and political instabil-
ity, Bangladesh's economic situation requires persistent efforts at efficient
economic planning and implementation. On July 1, 1975, Bangladesh initiated
an economic stabilization program in conjunction with a standby arrangement
with the IMF. Its principal elements consisted of a credit restraint program
and elimination of deficit financing combined with some import liberalization.
This was preceded by a devaluation of 58% in May 1975. The record so far is
that the credit restraint program has been a success: after an estimated rate
of inflation of about 80% in 1974, prices declined by 10% in 1975. The Gov-
ernment has not merely avoided deficit financing, it has retired some of its
debts to the banking system. The import-licensing program has been relaxed
in the first half of 1975/76; besides increasing allocations to an average of
95% of entitlements, licenses have been renewed on expiry and there is greater
fungibility in the use of exchange allocations for selected categories of im-
ports.
8.         At the beginning of 1975/76 the credit restrictions may have been
too pervasive and insufficiently selective; jute purchases by trading
corporations were hampered, productive credit was scarce, and import allo-
cations could not be utilized, Measures have been taken to rectify this



- 3 -
situation. Overall, however, the impact of the credit restraint program
on the reduction of the rate of inflation has been salutary. It has been
reinforced by other factors:
(a)   The recent Aman rice harvest is expected to amount
to 7-7.5 million tons and output for 1975/76 may be
about 13 million tons, representing an increase of
about 17% over 1974/75. Rice harvests in West Bengal
have also been exceptionally good and prices have been
declining rapidly there.
(b)   The border with India is being policed intensively and
smuggling has dwindled.
(c)   The supply position for raw materials has improved
during 1975/76. Larger import allocations have been
boosted by substantial declines in the prices of key
imports.
(d)   Capacity utilization and output have increased in a
number of industries and inventories of finished goods
are higher.
9.         The devaluation has made possible a reduction in the price of raw
jute exports from the unrealistic level of E 200 per ton (late 1974 and early
1975) to E 150 per ton (from July 15, 1975), f.o.b. Chittagong; they now stand
at a level of E 166 per ton. The reduction in price has led to an increase
in sales of raw jute. However, export earnings from manufactured jute goods
are likely to fall in 1975/76 because the large decline in export prices has
not been compensated by an increase in export volume. The problem is espe-
cially acute for jute manufactures because of the international economic
recession, and because of increased competition from India which has reduced
tariffs for some products and provided export subsidies for others. Bangla-
desh's non-traditional exports have derived benefits from the devaluation,
and as a result, these exports may be expected to pick up in the course of
1975/76. The total value of merchandise exports is expected to be about
US$350 million in 1975/76 compared to about US$400 million in 1974/75. On
the import side, improvements are noticeable in the licensing program, but
import procedures continue to be complicated. In spite of recent measures
to reduce the role of the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh it continues
to monopolize a substantial part of the import business. It is estimated
that about 1.6 million tons of food valued at about US$358 million (including
shipping) will be imported in 1975/76. Sizeable imports of edible oil,
cement, cotton, yarn, fertilizers and raw materials are also indicated.
The total value of merchandise imports is expected to approximate US$1,286
million in 1975/76, but import payments are likely to approach US$1,420 mil-
lion due to retirement of outstanding letters of credit from 1974/75.
10.       For the first time since independence, the availability of external
resources was not the binding constraint on the Bangladesh economy in 1975/76.



- 4 -
The year began with a relatively high level of foreign exchange reserves
(US$265 million). Aid bolstered by the agreement with the International Mone-
tary Fund, continued to be at a high level. Excluding IMF assistance (US$106
million), the commitment of foreign aid in 1975/76 was about US$945 million,
about two-thirds of which was in the form of food and commodities aid. The
level of aid disbursement in 1975/76 (including IMF assistance) is expected
to be about US$1,011 million. In 1976/77 it is estimated that approximately
US$950 million of aid disbursements will be required.
11.        The agricultural sector has done quite well in 1975/76 with over-
all production increasing more than 10%; however problems remain. The
small-scale irrigation program (comprising low-lift pumps, shallow and deep
tubewells) has again fallen short of its target; procedures for the alloca-
tion of fertilizer, though much improved, continue to be deficient, and
credit is insufficient and inadequately distributed. Because of the steep
fall in the free market price, Government procurement of rice has increased
dramatically - procurement in 1975/76 is expected to approximate 400-450
thousand tons - although farmers are still hampered by the stringent moisture
content requirements and the unfamiliar payment procedures. This has led
to farmers selling their paddy at prices below the procurement price. This
helps alleviate the Government's budget and storage problems but undermines
the ability of the Government procurement program to provide a floor price
for rice. Storage facilities for foodgrain have been strained and problems
arising from exposure of foodgrains to the elements are beginning to be of
some significance. The Government is considering phasing imports of food-
grains; in the meantime, efforts are being made to rehabilitate approximate-
ly 200,000 tons of derelict storage capacity.
12.        In the industrial sector capacity utilization has improved in a
number of industries, especially fertilizer, and the supply of raw material
and spares is more stable. But stocks remain unsold in the case of a
number of consumer products primarily due to inflexible pricing policies;
production of the wrong assortment (e.g. in textiles); competition from
imports under the Wage Earners' Scheme; and a reduction in consumer demand
(partly as a result of dissaving that occurred during the preceding three
years of inflation). With a few exceptions, public enterprises are still
generally deficient in management and labor productivity, and lack autonomy
in the matter of staffing and pricing policies.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BANGLADESH
13.       After Bangladesh became a member of the Bank and IDA in August 1972,
Bank Group operations in Bangladesh concentrated initially on reactivation of
IDA credits for uncompleted projects financed under credits to Pakistan before
the independence of Bangladesh. Eleven such credits in an aggregate amount of
US$151.35 million (including US$44.1 million for the repayment of amounts that
had been disbursed under the corresponding previous credits to Pakistan) have
been made to Bangladesh. In addition, 14 new credits have been made totalling
US$431.7 million. Of these US$275.0 million have been for program credits.
The project credits have emphasized agricultural development, but also included



- 5 -
amounts for population, telecommunications and transport. In October 1975
Bangladesh applied for membership in IFC. The Board of Governors have since
passed a resolution approving this application and Bangladesh is expected to
become a member soon.
14.       The debt service ratio in 1974/75 was 15.9%.    For 1975/76, the ratio
is estimated at nearly 20%. Negotiations are underway between the Government
of Bangladesh and the various bilateral and multilateral donors concerning
the assumption by Bangladesh of a portion of the debt contracted by Pakistan
before Bangladesh became independent. Bangladesh's debt service ratio is
therefore expected to increase further ini the coming years. With respect
to the Bank Group, Bangladesh has agreed to accept liability for certain
debt for projects visibly located in Bangladesh and completed before inde-
pendence. A consolidation loan of about US$54.9 million and a consolidation
credit of about US$31.0 million (based on January 1, 1960 exchange rate) were
signed on February 14, 1975. The Bank Group's share of Bangladesh's outstand-
ing external debt is not expected to rise significantly over the next few
years.
15.        Bangladesh's severe balance or payments difficulties require that
increased amounts of aid be given in a flexible, fast disbursing fashion.
Program lending should therefore remain a feature of IDA assistance. For
the next several years the requirements of existing productive capacity will
remain high for the types of goods - spares, components and raw materials -
financed by IDA program credits. However, long-term improvement in the
Bangladesh economy can be expected only [f sound policies, programs, and
development projects are pursued. Thus, projects of the highest priority
must also be supported. Given its low per capita income, Bangladesh's in-
vestment requirements cannot be met entirely from local resources. In
view of Bangladesh's difficult foreign exchange position, IDA credits should
cover all foreign exchange costs. Taking into account the level of financing
expected to be available from other external lenders, and in order to direct
IDA lending to those sectors (such as agricultural and rural development)
where the percentage of foreign exchange costs is relatively low, the finan-
cing of local currency expenditures is also justified.
16.       Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits and the Bank
loan made to Bangladesh as of March 31, 1976 and notes on the status of
execution of ongoing projects. After an initial slow start, disbursement
performance under the program credits has been good, keeping pace with the
estimates made during appraisal. In contrast, disbursements under project
credits have lagged far behind expectations. Reasons for this include prob-
lems associated with release of local funds, clearance of contracts, employ-
ment of consultants and appointment of needed staff. The Government of
Bangladesh is aware of what the bottlenecks are and recently has taken steps
aimed at eliminating the most pressing of them and speeding up the implemen-
tation of projects, especially foreign aided projects. The release of local
funds for projects to semi-autonomous gcvernment agencies now requires one
application per year instead of the previous disruptive requirement of quar-
terly applications. The approval of the President is no longer required for
contracts and the ceiling for contracts which can be approved directly by the
project implementing agencies has been raised from Taka 700,000 to Taka 10



- 6 -
million. The requirements that the President approve all consultants'con-
tracts has been waived. The responsibility now devolves upon the parent min-
istries of project agencies to approve the appointment of consulting firms
for projects with National Economic Comm-ittee approval, or for project prep-
aration activities. Finally, in the area of appointment of staff recent
changes require the Establishment Divisicn and the Ministry of Finance to
issue specific instructions making the authorization of the appointment of
staff automatic in the case of approved projects.
17.       Long-term improvement in the Bangladesh economy can be expected
only if sound policies, programs, and development projects are pursued. IDA
recognizes the prime importance of the agricultural sector and of efforts
to close Bangladesh's food gap. In this connection the Population, Ashuganj
Fertilizer, Barisal Irrigation and the Karnafuli Irrigation Projects as well
as the Agricultural and Rural Training Project which was recently approved,
all fit into the strategy of increasing food production and reducing the
food gap in the future. Other priority projects are at an advanced stage
of preparation - many of them in the agricultural sector. These include
irrigation works in the Muhuri area and a shallow tubewell project. In the
industrial field, action programs developed by IDA in connection with the
Fourth Imports Program Credit (No. 591-BD) and approved by GOB are expected
to strengtheen the efficiency of the two most important sub-sectors -- jute
and cotton textiles. While development of the rural sector must have top
priority, the growth of other sectors cannot be neglected. Particular
emphasis should be placed upon projects which provide infrastructure for the
rural sector, or which process or provide outlets for its products, or
which reduce the strain on Bangladesh's foreign exchange resources. Several
sector studies supported by IDA - for example in industry and transportation
(also assisted by the United Kingdom) - should help the Government and IDA
tc develop a suitable pipeline of projects consonant with mutual assessments
of economic priorities. Further economic studies will be or-iented to the
same goal. Finally, IDA has provided funds under the Technical Assistance
Credits to assist the Government in improving project preparation and imple-
mentation capabilities.
PART III - INDUSTRY IN BANGLADESH
18.       Agriculture dominates Bangladesh's economy and development pros-
pects, accounting for as much as 55% of GDP and 75% of all employment.
Since 1969/70 there has been no census of industry but estimates indicate the
manufacturing sector accounted for some 7-8% of GDP and 6.0% of employment.
The growth rate of industrial value added has been twice that of the economy
as a whole, averaging about 6% per annum during the 1950s and 1960s. Manufac-
tured goods account for almost two-thirds of total export earnings. Industry
has an increasingly important contribution to make to income growth, employment
creation and foreign exchange earnings and savings.
19.       After independence the Government nationalized most medium- and
large-scale industrial units and the public sector now covers the units that



- 7 -
belonged to the public sector previously under the management of the East
Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation, the units that were owned by
West Pakistani entrepreneurs and abandoned by them during the war, and all
the units in the jute, cotton textile and sugar industr[es.     The public
sector now comprises about 350 units with about 250,000 workers and about
70% of the fixed assets of modern manufacturing, that is, excluding cottage
industries. These are organized under several industrial "corporations".
The private industrial sector now consists mostly of small-scale enterprises.
Private medium- and large-scale units exist to a significant extent only in
the pharmaceutical (three foreign owned units), edible oil and steel re-
rolling industries.
Performance in 1974/75 and 1975/76
20.       During 1974/75 several difficulties were encountered by the jute
industry, which contributes one-third of the value added in manufacturing
and employs more than 200,000 workers. Largely due to a reduction in world
demand, the export of jute manufactures wlhich stood at 380,000 toins in 1974/75
was lower than the 1973/74 level by 13% and the 1969/70 level by 24%. Exports
of hessian and carpet backing were severely affected by the deterioration in
price competitiveness of jute vis-a-vis synthetic substitutes, as well as the
world recession. However, high export prLces of jute manufactures during
1974/75 resulted in export earnings of US$213 million, an increase of US$19
million over the 1973/74 level.
21.       The jute industry has benefitted from the devaluation of the Taka
in May 1975 as well as recent recovery in the world market. During the
10-month period of April 1975 - February 1976 the export price of jute goods
had declined by 26% for hessian, 33% for sacking and 17% for carpet backing,
and for the first time in many years jute goods are priced competitively
vis-a-vis synthetic substitutes. Export sales of jute goods during the
first 8 months of 1975/76 have amounted to 410,000 tons, showing an increase
of 57% over the corresponding period of 1974/75. It is expected that for
the financial year 1975/76, export sales of jute goods will exceed 500,000
tons and export shipments will total 450,000 tons, to reach the highest level
since independence. However, this years projected exports may earn only
about US$190 million.
22.       The cotton textile industry continued to show improvement
in 1974/75 as shown by a 6 percent increase in overall ouput over
the previouus year. However, some decline2s in output of both cotton yarn
and cloth may be expected during 1975/76 in view of the excessively high
stock position of finished products.
23.       Sugar production of about 98,000 tons during 1974/75, exceeded the
pre-independence level. However, due to a sharp decline in sugarcane acreage,
sugar production during 1975/76 is estimated at only about 86,000 tons. Tea
production of 67 million pounds during 1974/75, the highest level since
independence, is expected to show further improvement in 1975/76, benefiting
from an improved profitability position after the devaluation of the Taka.
Production of fertilizer fell drast-ically from 289,300 tons in 1973/74 to



- 8 -
100,000 tons in 1974/75 due to an explosion in the Ghorashal plant at the
beginning of 1974/75, which could not resume production until June 1975.
Fertilizer output during 1975/76 will reach a level of about 370,000 zons.
24.       The paper and pulp industry has encountered serious problems due
to a fall in demand, especially in the export market. Output of paper and
newsprint during 1975/76 will fall below the 1974/75 levels of 25,000 and
29,000 tons, respectively. Cement production increased from 53,000 tons in
1973/74 to 143,000 tons in 1974/75, due to the commencement of production at
the Chittagong clinker grinding plant in July, 1974. A low level of demand
and continuing imports continued to restrict output in 1975/76 to about
133,000 tons. Output in the fish processing industry suffered a setback in
1974/75 as a result of a poor catch but has shown significant improvement
during 1975/76, benefiting from an improved catch of shrimp and higher
prices in the export market. The leather industry is expected to record
an increase both in output and exports dbe to buoyant demand for semi-
finished leather in export markets. Production in some import-dependent
industries such as petroleum products and steel products showed some improve-
ment in 1974/75, as a result of the high priority given to these sectors
in import allocation; they will not be constrained by a shortage of foreign
exchange during 1975/76.
25.       The devaluation of the Taka was inter alia intended to improve the
financial position of export industries, increase export earnings, particular-
ly from jute, and help to ease import restrictions by reducing scarcity
premiums on imports resulting from the over-valued exchange rate of the Taka.
Although the devaluation was welcomed by the export sector as a long overdue
step, some concerns were expressed as to the possible impact on prices, thus
affecting the production costs and profitability of import-dependent indus-
tries. Several general observations can be drawn from the experiences during
the first several months after the devaluation. While the international
demand for raw jute increased and export sales rose substantially the export
performance of jute manufactures in terms of foreign exchange earnings has
been modest, particularly due to a decline in export prices dictated in
part by the international econom-Lc recession, although the volume of exports
has increased significantly. But non-jute exports, especially tea, leather
and shrimps, have benefitted from the devaluation through improved profitabil-
ity; there has been no significant decline in their export prices, as in the
case of jute. Finally, the impact of higher prices on import-dependent
sectors has been mitigated to a great extent as a result of declining prices
of imported raw materials. For example, production costs for cotton yarn and
cloth have only increased by about 1-2 percent after the devaluation, due to a
sharp decline in the C&F price of raw cotton from about 75 cents per pound in
1974/75 to 48 cents per pound during the first half of 1975/76. The impact on
the steel industry has also been reduced by significant declines in the prices
of pig iron, steel scraps and other raw materials as well as higher utilization
of productive capacity due to improved availability of foreign exchange.
26.       For the first time in many years the stock position of imported
raw materials appears sufficient in most industries and industrial production
does not suffer from shortages. In certain industries there is an excessive



- 9 -
accumulat[on of inventories in both raw materials and finished products. For
major industrial raw materials such as paper, pulp, coal, pig iron, crude
edible oil and steel scrap, the stock leval ranges from four to six months'
requirements. Inventories are also high in several important finished pro-
ducts such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, newsprint and billets.
27.       Several factors have contributed to the accumulation of invento-
ries in 1975/76. The import policy for the period January-June 1975, which
may have influenced the actual level of imports during the second half of 1975,
was quite liberal. Moreover, consumer demand seems to have fallen recently
as a result of the demonetization of 100 Taka notes and a tight credit policy,
while consumer incomes have also remained stagnant. Finally, the separation of
responsibility between production and distribution of products, combined with
the bonus system for nationalized enterprises, which is geared to levels of pro-
duction instead of sales or profits, have contributed to an excessive accumu-
lation of inventories regardless of the level of demand for these products.
Measures to reduce the high inventories of finished goods shouLd include
improved coordinat-ion of production and distribution, through further
liberalization of the distribution network, rationalization of production
plans based on realistic estimates of consumer demand, and proper restruc-
turing of the bonus system.
Investment
28.       Industrial investment remained at a low level during 1974/75, much
below the target set in the Development Plan. The actual development ex-
penditures of Tk 415 million for public enterprises during 1974/75 were only
60 percent of the planned level. The private investment sanctioned during
1974/75 amounted to Tk 144 million, as against Tk 350 million envisaged in
the Industrial Investment Schedule.
29.       There are several reasons for the low level of industrial investment
in Bangladesh since independence. Lack of adequate financing, particularly
due to shortages of foreign exchange, and low levels of consumer demand in
relation to the already existing productive capacity have been important
factors limiting industrial investment, in both public and private sectors.
Various restrictions, imposed by the Government since independence, stuch as
monetary ceilings on private investment and the reservation of key industries
for the public sector, have also contributed their share. A deficiency in
project implementation capacity has been another important reason for the
shortfall in public sector investment.
30.       The Government has recently taken several important steps to pro-
mote private investment in Bangladesh: (i) the ceiling on private invest-
ment has been raised from Tk 30 million (US$2 million) to Tk 100 million
(about US$7 million); (ii) public sector corporations have been allowed to
set up enterprises in collaboration with the private sector, in sectors other
than jute, cotton textiles and sugar, with the public corporations retaining
majority shares; (iii) the former owners of nationalized enterprises will be
paid compensation according to an announced schedule; (iv) the stock exchange



- 10 -
will be reactivated; and (v) about 85 public enterprises in sectors such as
tanneries, food products, and pharmaceuticals will be returned to private
entrepreneurs.
31.       These revisions in the Investment Policy for the private sector re-
present a signif-icant departure from the earlier policy of the Government on
the role of the private sector and reflect a more realistic approach towards
industrial development in Bangladesh. The new ceiling of Tk 100 million on
private investment is not expected to be a serious constraint on an expansion
of investment. The decision to pay compensation to the former owners of the
nationalized units is expected to have favorable psychological and financial
effects in promoting private investment. Accelerated disinvestment of small
and, in many cases, financially unprofitable public enterprises, may contribute
to a better financial performance by the public sector. Although the short-
run effects of these new measures may turn out to be small, the private sec-
tor will benefit considerably from these changes in the medium and long-run.
32.       Public sector investments are certain to fall considerably behind
Plan estimates due to delays in project preparation and insufficient financ-
ing. The Plan does not attach adequate importance to the need to develop
export industries, and the emphasis it accords to new projects rather than
balancing and modernization seems inappropriate. One of the constraints
affecting private investments is the length of time and large number of
agencies concerned with approval of investments. During negotiation, there-
fore, GOB agreed to undertake a study of the measures that might be taken
to expedite Government's approval process for investment proposals. To
stimulate investment in export oriented industries GOB also agreed to initiate
a feasibility study for export processing zones permitting unlimited duty free
imports. (See draft Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.04.)
33.       Investment Incentives.   Incentives to new private industries
include a five year tax holiday (provided 50% of profits are re-invested),
deferred payment and partial rebates of custom duties on machinery, and
repatriation privileges for foreign investors. For export industries,
incentives include income tax concessions, and additional raw material
import licenses.
Industrial Financing
34.       The industrial sector is served by a number of financial institu-
tions. There are nine commercial banks (six of which are nationalized and
three are foreign owned). The Bangladesh Shilpa Bank (BSB), the beneficiary
of the proposed credit, and the Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha (BSRS) are
two specialized industrial financing institutions which give medium and
long-term industrial loans to finance private and public sector projects.
A third specialized institution, the Bangladesh Small Industries Corporation
(BSIC) extends limited financing to small-scale industries while Bangladesh
Krishi Bank (BKB) specializes in agricultural financing.
35.       Bangladesh Shilpa Bank (BSB) is an important source of institu-
tional industrial finance and provides roughly half the medium and long-
term debt financing for industry in Bangladesh. In addition to raising



- 11 -
foreign and domestic resources for its own financing, BSB normaLly requires
project sponsors to raise from other sources at least 60% of the total
project cost. GOB intends to have BSB's activities overlap to some extent
with those of BSRS. There is scope for both of these institutions to con-
tribute to industrial development and the competition could prove beneficial.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
36.       The project was appraised in March 1975.    A credit and project
summary is given in Annex III. A report entitled "Bangladesh: Appraisal of
the Bangladesh Shilpa Bank" has been circulated separately to the Executive
Directors. Negotiations were held in Washington from March 22, 1976 to
March 25, 1976. The borrower was represented by Mr. Syeduzzaman Secretary
Ministry of Finance and BSB was represented by Mr. A.H.M. Kamaluddin,
Chairman and Managing Director.
BSB's Role
37.       The Bangladesh Shilpa Bank (BSB) is the successor to the former
East Pakistan wing of the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP),
and is responsible for providing finance and technical assistance to indus-
trial enterprises. GOB confirmed that BSB's financing role would be expected
to continue to include the financing through loans (both short and long),
equity investments and guarantees of public and private sector industries,
for new and expansion projects as well as modernization, balancing and re-
placement projects.
Ownership and Resources
38.       BSB's Tk 50 million of share capital is owned entirely by GOB.
As of December 31, 1975, BSB also had Tk 167 million of subordinated Govern-
ment loans, Tk 97 million of deposits (3 years and above), Tk 40 million of
outstanding debentures (held by commercial banks), and Tk 9 million of central
bank borrowings. In addition BSB's FY75 balance sheet provides for a contingent
liability of about Tk 588 million for past IDBP borrowings (primarily from for-
eign creditors) for which the allocation of responsibility between Bangladesh
and Pakistan is still the subject of negotiations. Foreign funds received by
BSB include a US$12.6 million credit from the Asian Development Bank, a Dtf 3
million loan from KfW which is not yet effective, and two tied credits from
India aggregating US$3.1 million.
39.       At June 30, 1975 BSB's ratio of debt to equity plus subordinated
loan was only 3.4:1. However, in view of the expected rapid expansion in
BSB's level of activities, additional capital will be required in order to
remain within the 5:1 debt/equity limit. GOB recently converted Tk 150
million of its Tk 167 million of subordinated debt to reserves. At inde-
pendence, BSB informally assigned to itself the liabilities of IDBP that
corresponded to assets in Bangladesh, though this has not been formally



- 12 -
recognized by GOB. In addition, GOB agreed to increase further BSB's equity
which may be needed to offset any additional liabilities of BSB's predecessors
in excess of the amounts set aside for this contingency in BSB's balance
sheet. (Section 3.05 of the draft Development Credit Agreement and Section
3.05 of the draft Project Agreement.) Finally as a condition of effectiveness
GOB agreed to provide BSB with Tk 50 million of additional equity capital.
Board, Management, and Staff
40.       BSB's first Board of Directors was appointed in early 1975, and
consists of a Managing Director as Chairman, three GOB officials and two
representatives from the private sector. GOB intends to strengthen the Board
by adding at least two more Members who have had experience implementing
industrial projects. In order to strengthen the top management, and as a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit, BSB has agreed to-appoint
a Director of Operations and a Chief Accountant both with suitable qualifica-
tions and experience. BSB's management and professional staff are experienced
and well-qualified. However, BSB is in urgent need of additional staff to
work on appraisals, follow up, and internal accounting. Also, external
technical assistance to be financed by UNDP, with IDA as executing agency is
needed for economic project analysis, project promotion, accounting and
management information and control systems. Thus BSB will employ two experts,
one in economic appraisal and a second in accounting and information systems
each with qualifications, and experience acceptable to IDA. Hitherto, BSB,
like all other public sector entities, had to obtain Government approval of
its general staffing plans, recruitment and promotions. In fact, the Public
Service Commission selects BSB staff. Although the BSB Managing Director sits
on PSC during selections, the system causes recruitment delays and prevents
selection of suitable staff. GOB confirmed that recruitment of lower grade
BSB staff will be exempt from Public Service Commission and that most higher
grade staff selection would be made by a Special Selection board including
the BSB Managing Director and other representatives. GOB would continue to
appoint the Managing Director, General Manager and Deputy General Manager.
Operating Policies and Procedures
41.       BSB prepared a Strategy Paper outlining its institutional objectives
and financing priorities over the next few years (see Annex 15 of Appraisal
Report). The Strategy Paper gives appropriate emphasis to the improvement
of BSB's follow up on existing projects, most of which are in arrears. BSB
future financing priorities are consistent with those of GOB, although BSB's
Strategy Paper represents a further definition of its own investment priorities
beyond that provided in GOB investment schedules. In general, BSB will give
priority to export industries and industries based on domestic raw materials.
Balancing, modernization, and replacement of existing plants will be given
priority over new investments. BSB will avoid financing projects in sectors
where there is significant underutilization of existing capacity. BSB has
demonstrated an ability to perform thorough technical, financial, and eco-
nomic project appraisals. Further improvements are possible, particularly in
deepening management and staff understanding of economic analysis of projects,
which BSB began only in 1974.



- 13 -
42.       BSB's procurement and disbursement procedures are satisfactory.
BSB requires project sponsors to obtain alternative quotations on equipment
purchases and large construction contracts; in some cases it seeks out quota-
tions on its own to check those submitted by sponsors. BSB's follow up on
projects in operation is inadequate. The most serious organizational defi-
ciency at present is the lack of a management information and control system.
Past Operations
43.       From the establishment of IDBP in 1961 through June 30, 1970, that
institution approved about Rs 1 billion of financing to over 1,000 projects
in what is now Bangladesh. New approvals aggregated little more than Tk 100
million during the following three year period due to disturbances coinciding
with independence and BSB's lack of foreign exchange. BSB then received a
credit from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and approved Tk 76 million of
loans in FY74 (ending June 30), and Tk 268 million in FY75. By early 1975,
BSB's commitments and disbursements had just began to reflect its return to
substantial approval levels.
44.       BSB's lending reflects the sectoral distribution of Bangladesh
industry in general; nearly three-fourths of its loans have been for jute
and cotton textiles. Other sectors include food and beverages, paper, non-
metallic minerals, metal products, and services, all of which are consumer-
oriented. Historically, the average size of BSB's loans has been about
US$200,000. BSB has provided Tk 17 million to 400 small-scale enter-
prises (total fixed assets under Tk 2.5 million). About 40% (by amount)
of BSB's outstanding loans are concentrated in the three cities of Dacca,
Chittagong, and Khulna, but BSB's pipeline of new projects indicates a
wider geographical dispersion of investments. In the past, most of IDBP's
investments had been to private sector companies; however, many of these
have since been nationalized (particularly jute and cotton textiles).
Over 60% of BSB's future investments are expected to be in the public
sector.
Portfolio and Financial Results
45.       As has been the case for Bangladesh industry in general, BSB-
financed projects suffered damages and severe disruptions during the in-
dependence movement. The operations of many firms have also been hampered
by the loss of markets in and supplies from Pakistan, as well as shortages
of imported inputs. Primarily as a result of these factors, but in part
due to inadequate collection efforts by BSB, over 70% of BSB's portfolio
is affected by arrears.
46.       About 54% of BSB's portfolio is in the jute industry.     Aside from
other factors mentioned above, arrears on BSB's jute industry loans are the
result of Government pricing and exchange rate policies, and a moratorium on
loan repayments imposed by the Government. in 1973. The Government intended
that the moratorium would last for five years following which new repayment
schedules would begin. As a condition of effectiveness, BSB will sign



- 14 -
rescheduling agreements for all its outstanding jute loans on terms satis-
factory to IDA. GOB and IDA have reached agreement on special arrangements to
protect BSB from the dangers of future default on its jute sector loans made
prior to December 16, 1971. In the event that a default occurred on a BSB
foreign currency loan to a jute enterprise in any financial year, GOB would
reduce the amount of the next scheduled repayments by BSB on its obligations
to GOB in the subsequent financial year until the sum of reductions equalled
the default amount. In case of a local currency default on a BSB jute loan,
GOB agreed to provide BSB with an interest-free loan equal to the default
amount, convertible to a grant or contribution to BSB equity if BSB were
unable to collect the outstanding debt within two years after the default.
These arrangements, however, would cease to apply to any outstanding debt from
an enterprise which has received a new loan from BSB, or an enterprise which
is judged financially sound and should therefore be able to service its debt
obligation. Though the above arrangements would largely absolve BSB from the
credit risks on its jute portfolio for the time being, the deferred GOB
compensation to BSB for defaults would encourage BSB to continue collection
efforts to improve its liquidity position. (See draft Development Credit
Agreement, Section 3.06).
47.       About 26% of BSB's portfolio is in non-jute public sector enter-
prises. BSB officials have met with public sector corporations and have
agreed on target dates for repayment of outstanding arrears. As of February
1976, BSB had collected 92% of its FY76 collection targets from both public
and private sector projects excluding jute. Also, BSB has visited private
sector clients which have not made payments in the last two years, as well
as a sample of its small scale industry clients, and in each case has either
made collections, rescheduled or initiated legal proceedings against them.
48.        In addition to the above, IDA discussed with BSB several general
measures BSB can take to improve its collection activities, and follow up of
projects. BSB proposed to increase the number of professional staff working
on follow up, to supervise ongoing projects more closely, and strengthen in-
ternal reporting and review procedures to keep management fully abreast with
problem projects.
49.       Inadequate data on client operations, uncertainties regarding BSB's
responsibility for past IDBP borrowing, lack of qualified accounting staff,
and deficiencies in accounting procedures and methods resulted in unsatis-
factory audit reports for BSB in FY73 and FY74. A satisfactory long-form
audit report prepared at IDA's request on BSB's FY75 accounts indicates that
on the basis of a case by case review of BSB's portfolio, Tk 178.9 million in
provisions for principal and overdue interest were required. However, this
included Tk 134.9 million representing provisions for jute enterprises. Thus,
it is estimated that BSB required Tk 44 million in provisions of principal and
overdue interest for non-jute loans at the end of FY75 while actual provisions
amounted to Tk 70.9 million. At the same time, the auditors also recommended
that BSB make equity provisions of Tk 3.8 million which is more than covered
by the excess provisions.



- 15 -
50.       BSB's net income increased from Tk 2.6 million in FY72 to Tk 13.8
million in FY75, which was about 6% of equity plus subordinated loans. BSB
enjoys an average spread on borrowed funds of over 4%. Its administrative
expenses are less than one percent of average total assets. At independence,
BSB informally assigned to itself liabilities and a portion of the equity of
IDBP that corresponded to assets in Bangladesh. GOB has not yet recognized
the major portion of these liabilities relating to external credits, 1/ and
BSB is therefore not currently making any repayments on them.
Objectives and Features of the Credit
51.       BSB is likely to require a total of about US$44 million to cover
its foreign currency financing requirements through 1977. Against this
it now has only US$3 million equivalent in tied credits from India and
US$1.25 million equivalent from KfW. A US$25 million credit to BSB is
recommended to meet part of its foreign currency commitment requirements
through calendar 1977. ADB is willing to consider an additional loan of
US$15 million to BSB once the proposed credit has been substantially
committed to fill the balance of BSB's resource gap during this period.
The above approach provides for an IDA coinmitment period of only 18 months
which is appropriate given BSB's present difficulties. The objectives of the
credit would include: (i) stimulating the development of industry, with a
consequent favorable impact on employment, incomes and foreign exchange
earnings and savings; (ii) helping to create a more favorable policy climate
for investment in export-oriented projects; and (iii) helping to restore BSB's
creditworthiness within a reasonable time frame through an agreed program of
action to strengthen its soundness and effectiveness as a development bank.
52.       The IDA funds would be re-lent by GOB to BSB at not less than 9%
and re-lent by BSB to its sub-borrowers at not less than 12%, with the latter
taking the foreign exchange risk. The free limit should be set at US$150,000
and the aggregate free limit at US$6 million. These limits would allow IDA
to review about 25% by number of the subprojects to be financed by BSB cover-
ing at least 76% by amount of the total credit. IDA will disburse against
withdrawal applications to finance 100% of the CIF cost of direct imports, 70%
of the invoice price of previously imported goods purchased within Bangladesh,
and 25% of construction costs (representing the import component). The amor-
tization schedule for the GOB loan to BSB (of 18 years including 3 years
of grace) should be the aggregate of the amortization schedules of the BSB
subprojects, with a maximum maturity of 15 years from the date of subpro-
ject approval by IDA.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the People's Republic
of Bangladesh and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the
1/   The part relating to a previous IDA Credit to IDBP (177-PAK) has been
recognized by the Government.

Association and BSB, the recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a
draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately.
54.       Features of the draft Development Credit Agreement and draft Pro-
ject Agreement of special interest are referred to in paragraphs 39 and 46.
55.       The following would be special conditions of effectiveness of
the proposed Credit:
(a) that BSB has appointed a Director of Operations and a
Chief Accountant, both with suitable qualifications and
experience;
(b) that BSB has appointed an expert in economic appraisal and project
promotion, and an expert in accounting and information systems,
each with qualifications, experience and terms and conditions
of employment satisfactory to the Association;
(c) that BSB has signed rescheduling agreements acceptable to
the Association with each jute processing enterprise having
outstanding debt to BSB; and
(d) that GOB has provided Tk 50 million of additional equity
to BSB.
56.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
57.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION l/
Cr. No. 339     Cyclone Area Reconstruction Project; US$25.0 Million Credit
of October 18, 1972; Effective Date: January 17, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
Implementation of the original project, financed under Credit No.
228-PAK of 1971, had not commenced prior to the suspension of disbursements.
Progress on the implementation of the Inland Water Subproject under this
Credit has been slow. Only 78% of the funds have so far been disbursed,
compared with an estimate of 100% by June 30, 1974 at the time of appraisal.
Repair and construction of terminals have been delayed because of lack of
materials and slow land acquisition; but by September 1975 all contracts on
civil works were awarded, except one minor contract which was withdrawn, and
all works are now expected to be completed by late 1976. A contract for
the construction of five service-support vessels amounting to US$3.5 million
was awarded in December 1974, and all have been received. Contracts have been
signed for all equipment component of the telecommunications system. Earthwork
has been completed for about 50% of primary roads, and 70 cyclone shelters are
under construction or complete. Activation of the cyclone warning system is
expected soon. Progress was slow initially due in part to administrative
delays and the severe shortages of construction materials in Bangladesh.
Construction materials are now available, progress has improved somewhat.
Project completion is expected to be about two years behind the schedule
anticipated at appraisal. In June 1974, the Government submitted to the
Association a proposal for reducing the scope of the project in order to cope
with the sharp increase in construction costs since the Project was appraised.
The proposal involved reductions in the feeder roads to be financed by the
Credit (financing for these roads has been obtained from the World Food
Program), reductions in the fisheries subproject, and minor reductions in
other project items. Given the very early stage of procurement under the
project, it was decided not to formally amend the project at that stage,
and it was agreed that the Government's proposals for reducing the project
provided a reasonable basis for proceeding for the time being. A revised
proposal from the Government based upon revised cost estimates, concerning
the amendments required in the project description and allocation of the
amounts of the credit to each subproject has been received and is under
review.
1/ These noted are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 340    Chandpur Irrigation II Project:   US$13.0 Million Credit of
October 18, 1972; Effective Date: January 17, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The Project is far behind schedule and continues to be plagued with
problems. Major flooding, work stoppages caused by 100% increase in con-
struction labor costs, shortages of cement, fuel, and operable construction
equipment, ineffective management, inadequate provision of local funds and
general inflation are factors which have delayed project construction. There
is some improvement in construction recently. Outstanding contractor claims
have recently been resolved. Manufacture of the electrical and mechanical
equipment for the regulators and pumping plant has been completed, and
delivery is being made to the sites. Delays in finalizing the low-lift
pump specifications by WDB retarded procurement. Tenders have now been
issued. Continuing inflation and other adverse fact-ors are expected to
increase the Project costs substantially over the'appraisal estimate.
Cr. No. 341    Tubewells Project; US$14.0 Million Credit of November 6, 1972;
Effective Date: January 13, 1973; Closing Date: December 31
1976
This project was originally financed by IDA Credit No. 208-PAK of
1970 and credits from Sweden and Canada. Although bids had been received in
1971, no contracts were awarded before Bangladesh independence. The present
Credit is again in conjunction with a Credit from Sweden and a grant from
Canada. Construction on this project began during January 1974. In April
1974, IDA approved award of the contract for supply of the well pumps and
engines. Due to initial delays, present implementation is about 18 months
behind schedule. Drilling of the tubewells has progressed satisfactorily
in the past construction season. Much greater efforts are required in the
design and construction of the water distribution systems to make maximum
use of the tubewells. The project agricultural development plan, crop trials
and development of demonstration farms are also behind schedule. A program
to assist in these areas as part of an ongoing UNDP project is under considera-
tion.
Cr. No. 343    Telecommunications Project:   US$7.3 Million Credit of November
15, 1972: Effective Date: January 17, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1978
The project was originally financed as part of Credit No. 145-PAK
of 1969, and goods and services valued at about US$2.2 million were received
in Dacca prior to suspension of disbursements. Three out of the four micro-
wave systems in the Project are under installation and are scheduled to be
commissioned by March 1976, and about one year behind schedule. The fourth
system is a replacement of a coaxial cable system in the original project.
This change was agreed to by IDA and was caused by price increases'demanded
by the original contractor which made thM choice of a microwave system more
economical. The bid invitation for this system has been included with the
bids that have already been invited for other microwave systems under
Credit 487-BD. Even so, the system is scheduled to be commissioned in
late 1977 or early 1978. The Closing Date for this Credit has been extended
from December 31, 1975 to June 30, 1978.

Cr. No. 353    Small-Scale Industry Project; US$3.0 Million Credit of
January 19, 1973; Effective Date: May 14, 1973:
Closing Date: March 31, 1977
The Project was originally financed by IDA Credit No. 192-PAK of
1970. The Credit has financed notional repayment of amounts previously dis-
bursed under Credit No. 192-PAK (US$187,000) and payment of outstanding
amounts for consulting services performed under Credit No. 192-PAK
(US$12,000).  Disbursements for new activities up to January 31, 1976
amounted to approximately US$2.4 million. However, outstanding orders
which would commit the remaining available funds were not expected to be
finalized before original closing date. IDA therefore agreed to extend
the closing date by nine months to allow for disbursements under outstand-
ing letters of credit. A IUNDP/UNIDO technical assistance project has made
some limited progress toward the reorganization of BSIC.
Cr. No. 367    Chittagong Water Supply Project; US$7.0 Million Credit of
April 9, 1973; Effective Date: June 7, 1973
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The project was originally financed by IDA Credit No. 42-PAK under
which USS3.3 million was disbursed. The work has progressed at a slow rate,
but will improve now that several civil works contracts are under way. Phys-
ical progress had been curtailed by laclc of cement, slow delivery of pipe,
and slow preparation of designs and contract documents. While the immediate
requirements for pipe and cement are on hand, several supply and construc-
tion contracts are yet to be tendered. WASA has been requested to hasten
the preparation of contract documents and the tendering for this work. Man-
agement, labor and union problems are now being better addressed following
the appointment of the new Chairman. While collection performance has im-
proved, financial operations and financial management remain weak. The Gov-
ernment has increased the water rates by 50 percent effective July 1, 1975.
However, unless the performance in billing and collection improves and leak-
age is reduced, further rate increases would be necessary to meet the finan-
cial covenants of the Credit Agreement. The Association has agreed to extend
the Closing Date by one year to June 30, 1976. At that time a decision will
be made, based upon the progress over the year in meeting the financial cov-
enants, as to whether or not to extend the Closing Date for the additional
1 to 1-1/2 years required to complete the project.
Cr. No. 368    Dacca Water and Sewerage Project; US$13.2 Million Credit of
April 9, 1973; Effective Date:   June 7, 1973
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The project was originally financed by IDA Credit No. 41-PAK of
1963. By December 1971, when disbursements were suspended, US$6.0 million
had been disbursed. The work has progressed at a slow rate but will improve
now that several civil works contracts are under way and tubewell materials
and equipment have been delivered. Right-of-way acquisition and contractor
performance continue as major problems. Management and labor problems con-
tinue, and financial operations and the financial condition of the WASA

remains weak. The Government has increased the water rates by 50 percent,
effective July 1, 1975. However, unless performance in billing and collec-
tion improves and leakage is reduced, further increases would be necessary
to meet the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement. The Association
has agreed to extend the Closing Date by one year to June 30, 1976. At that
time a decision will be made, based upon the progress over the year in meet-
ing the financial covenants, as to whether or not to extend the Closing Date
for the additional 1 to 1-1/2 years needed to complete the project.
Cr. No. 381    Foodgrain Storage Project; US$19.7 Million Credit of May 18,
1973; Effective Date: July 17, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
The project is also financed by a credit from the Kingdom of
Sweden of 25.0 million Kroner. The project was originally financed by
US$19.2 million IDA Credit No. 83 of 1966 and a 25 million Kroner credit
from the Kingdom of Sweden. The project was almost completed at the time
of Bangladesh's independence and 95% of the present IDA and Swedish credits
were used for repaying the previous credits. The remaining funds (US$1.25
million from IDA and about US$0.25 million equivalent from Sweden) are being
used to pay outstanding bills for work completed prior to the war, coinple-
tion of some supporting facilities for the grain storage silos, replacement
of spares and equipment damaged during the war, and a feasibility study for
a second grain storage project. The designs for the jetty modifications have
been approved and we are awaiting receipt of proposed arrangements for con-
struction. The feasibility study for a second grain storage project was
completed in October 1975. Supervision missions have reported serious deterio-
ration in the silos mechanical equipment due to inadequate maintenance. The
management and staffing of the Directorate of the Silos is inadequate. Delays
in ordering spare parts (for which funds are available under the Credit)
increase the risk of breakdown. The Government has agreed interalia (i) to
employ consultants to improve foodgrain storage management, (ii) to release
local funds required for ancillary civil works for the project, (iii) to fill
all managerial, technical, and administrative vacancies by June 30, 1976 and
(iv) to finalize the contract award for jetty construction by June 30, 1976.
Based upon these assurances the Association agreed that the Closing Date for
this Credit which had originally been December 31, 1974 be extended for a
second time from December 31, 1975 to June 30, 1976. The Government was
informed that any further extensions of the Closing Date required to complete
the project would be considered only if the Government has met its commitments
concerning steps to be taken to improve silo maintenance and operations.
Since January 1976 significant progress has been made in constructing
ancillary civil works, staffing the project agency, putting one silo back
into operation, issuing invitations for firms to submit proposals for con-
sulting services, and offering a tender for the Chittagong silo jetty.

Cr. No. 407    Education Project; US$21.0 Million Credit of June 29, 1973;
Effective Date: September 27, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project was originally financed by two IDA Credits 49-PAK and
98-PAK.  By December 1971, when disbursements were suspended, US$7.7 million
had been disbursed out of the US$17.5 million aggregate total of the two
former credits. The Credit 407-BD added US$3.5 million to the total of the
original Credits, in order to help the Government meet part of the increases
in total project cost. Progress on the Agricultural University portion of
the project was delayed initially due to difficulties in reaching agreement
with the consultant architects on a revised contract. Construction has also
been delayed due to shortage of building material, delays in the preparation
of equipment lists, and furniture designs. The recent devaluation of the
Taka has considerably reduced the cost overruns. Without including price
and physical contingencies, the cost of the project is now estimated at 58%
over the appraisal estimates in Taka terms, but only 10% when expressed in
US dollar equivalent. The Government has submitted to IDA proposals for
modification of the project to meet the cost overrun. These proposals are
currently under review. Implementation is about 24 months behind the
appraisal schedule. Progress on the technical education portion of the
project is about 12 months behind the appraisal schedule. The graduates are
facing severe problems of unemployment, and the curriculum needs revision to
make it more relevant to job requirements. The Government will be making
recommendations on the development plan of the Agricultural University shortly.
Cr. No. 408    Highways Project; US$25.0 Million of June 29, 1973;
Effective Date: September 27, 1973
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project was originally financed by IDA Credit No. 53-PAK. By
December 1971, when disbursements were suspended, US$3.62 million had been
disbursed, out of the original credit of US$22.5 million. The new credit
adds US$2.5 million to the original credit amount, in order to help the
Government meet part of the increase in total project cost as a result of
currency realignments. Four construction contracts were signed in September
1973 for the Sitalakhya Bridge and the Feni Section of the Dacca/Chittagong
road worth about US$9.2 million. A fifth contract with consultants for
construction supervision was signed in February 1974 but they were in the
field earlier. Shortage of spare parts, administrdtive delays and deficien-
cies in some contractors performance have delayed certain elements of the
project. Construction of the 1300-foot bridge over the Sitalakhya River
previously on schedule is now likely to be compieted two years behind
schedule, in mid-1978 due to technical difficulties compounded by poor
contractor performance. However, the twenty-mile Feni bypass road construc-
tion project is well on the way to completion and plans for paving the road
are now under preparation. The estimated cost of civil works has increased
by about 60%, in line with worldwide trends. However, the total overall
project cost increase is considerably less, being about 25%. Disbursements,
which in the past have been slow, show signs of improvement.

Cr. No. 409     Technical Assistance Project; US$4.0 Million Credit of
June 29, 1973; Effective Date: August 20, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
After a slow start, the Government has recently begun to take
advantage of the funds available under this credit for preinvestment plan-
ning, feasibility studies and technical assistance for agencies involved in
project planning and implementation. Contracts have been signed with con-
sultants for seven projects with an allocation from this Credit of about $1.3
million. These studies have played a key role in the preparation of the
Ashuganj Fertilizer Project and three other projects which are under con-
sideration for FY76 and FY77. Another six subprojects involving $2.3 mil-
lion of credit funds have been recently approved and arrangements for selec-
tion of consultants are underway. Credit funds are expected to be fully
committed by June 30, 1976, but some of the studies financed will take up
to two years to complete. The Closing Date for this Credit has been extended
from December 31, 1975 to December 31, 1977.
Cr. No. 410     Cereal Seeds Project; US$7.5 Million Credit of June 29, 1973;
Effective Date: January 30, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project is about 20 months behind appraisal schedule. Follow-
ing a year of virtual stagnation, the Seed Certification Agency has been
established, seed legislation has been drafted and procurement of equipment
and construction of buildings has started. However, serious staffing, pro-
curement and financial problems remain. The Government has been trying to
obtain additional bilateral financing to help meet the cost overrun. However,
the Government has now agreed to proceed with the full project, and to meet
the full cost overrun if other financing does not become available. Mean-
while, recruitment of key personnel has been extremely slow due to the
lengthy procedures required by the Government; appointments are required in
particular for the head of the Seed Certification Agency and for the general
manager (field) of Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC).
A full-time official in charge of coordination in the Ministry of Agriculture
has just been designated. Procurement of farm machinery has been held up
because of the bidders' failure to comply with tender specifications and by
the Government's unsuccessful efforts thereafter to arrange for bilateral
financing.
Cr. No. 424     Inland Water Transport Rehabilitation Project; US$8.7 Million
Credit of August 10, 1973, as amended by Amending Agreement
of October 17, 1975; Original Credit Effective Date:
September 27, 1973; Supplementary Credit Effective Date:
March 19, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The Amending Agreement of October 17, 1975 increased the amount
of the credit from US$4.1 million to US$8.7 million to finance the new oil
transfer system at Chittagong. The implementation of the original project

Page 9 of 11
has been slow. Only 54% of funds have been disbursed, compared with an
estimate of 100% by June 30, 1975 at the time of appraisal. Delays were
due to: (i) the initial lack of familiarity of the agencies with IDA
procedures; (ii) the difficult international situation in 1974; and (iii)
slow preparation of required documentation for procurement by various
operating agencies. Currently, 93% of funds allocated for procurement of
spare parts and equipment in the original credit have been committed, and
orders are expected to be completed by mid 1976. Regarding the repair of
the Chittagong off-shore oil terminal, detailed investigations indicated that
the damage was more severe than previously believed. Consultants were
appointed late in 1973 to study alternative technical solutions. An
Amending Agreement modifying the project description in line with the con-
sultants' recommendations, and providing a supplementary credit of USU4.6
million, was approved by the Executive Directors on September 16, 1975 and
signed on October 17, 1975. The project director and project officers were
appointed by January 1976 but there were delays in approval of the project
documents by the National Economic Council, agreement on onlending and pro-
ject documents by the National Economic Council, agreement on onlending
and project implementing arrangements between the Government and project
agencies, and appointment of consultants, which were conditions of effect-
iveness of the Amending Agreement. The Amending Agreement became effective
on March 19, 1976. The consultants are now at work. Based on their recom-
mendations, contracts for procurement of used tankers would be awarded
on the basis of quotations obtained for suitable vessels from international
brokers.
Cr. No. 487    Second Telecommunications Project; US$20.0 Million Credit of
June 26, 1974; Effective Date: July 23, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Credit became effective July 23, 1974. Procurement work is well
in hand with the major orders expected to be placed by March 1976. Local
telephone expansion has lagged about a year behind schedule due to slower
than expected deliveries from the local factory (hampered by labor unrest).
However, the factory production is now picking up and the shortfall in
project targets is expected to be made up by 1977. According to present
cost estimates, foreign costs are likely to be within the original estimates.
The local costs will increase from Tk 470 million to-Tk 680 million due to
higher labor and construction costs and the imposition of a 20% tax on all
imported goods. Under the Credit Agreement, BTT is to establish a modern
accounting system and is to be transformed into a Board with adequate auton-
omy. Accounting consultants have been appointed. The Board was legally
established before the June 30, 1975 deadiine, but the ordinance was revoked
almost immediately thereafter. A new ordinance establishing a Telecommunica-
tion board was recently promulgated. We are waiting further information on
the regulations under which the new Board will operate.

Cr. No. 515    Third Imports Program; US$75 Million Credit of October 9,
1974; Effective Date: October 10, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Provision was made to reimburse the Government for up to US$10 mil-
lion for eligible imports paid for after July 1, 1974, but prior to the date
of the credit. Disbursements amounted to US$63.2 million as of March 31,
1976, and in addition letters of credit guaranteed by IDA amount to US$6.9
million. The Credit approved on October 9, 1974 was for US$50 million, but
after the Fourth IDA Replenishment Agreement became effective, an amendment
increasing the credit amount was approved on February 27, 1975. The Amend-
ing Agreement was signed on March 10, 1975 and became effective on April 7,
1975. The Government has allocated the full amount of the Credit among the
various eligible industries, and import orders are being processed, and the
credit is expected to be fully disbursed by the Closing Date.
Cr. No. 527     Ashuganj Fertilizer Project; US$33 Million Credit of
February 11, 1975; Effective Date: December 19, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
Project is being cofinanced by Asian Development Bank, KfW, and
the Governments of Iran, Switzerland, UK and US, providing a total of $109
million equivalent in addition to the IDA credit. Site preparation work is
proceeding on schedule, but, overall, the project is about six months behind
schedule due primarily to delays in awarding the General Engineering and
Management Assistance Contracts. These contracts were signed in late
November/early December and the firms are expected to commence work in
Bangladesh early in 1976. Commencement of commercial production is now
expected by February 1979.
Cr. No. 533     Population Project:   US$15 Million Credit of February 11,
1975; Effective Date: September 25L_1975;
Closig Date:    December 31, 1982
Project is being confinanced by six co-lenders providing a total of
about $25 million equivalent in addition to the IDA credit. Notwithstanding
the delay in declaring the Credit effective, the Government has made substan-
tial progress in project implementation. The organizational structure of
the Population Control and Family Planning Division (body responsible for the
population program) has been defined and its staff is being placed in position.
The Population Program Officers, who are responsible for the population
programs of five non-health ministries, have been trained abroad and have
initiated the schemes of their respective ministries. A contract with
architectural consultants for the Building, Planning and Design Unit of the
Ministry of Health has been signed. The Government is proceeding with the
selection of required consultants and advisors for other parts of the project.
However, because of institutional problems, the implementation of a few project
components is some months behind schedule. In particular, the Government has
still to formally appoint a number of key personnel.
