INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPfENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
TELEPHONE ORGANIZATION OF THAILAND
FOR A TELECOMMNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Telephone Organization of Thailand with the guarantee of the
Kingdom of Thailand for the equivalent of US$37 million to help finance
a telecommunications project. The loan would have a term of 20 years,
including 4 years of grace, with interest at 7V per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Thailand for four weeks in September
1972 to update the basic report on Thailand's Third Five-Year Plan (1972-76)
that was distributed to the Executive Directors in January 1972 (EAP-28).
The mission's preliminary findings and conclusions are as follows.
3.        GDP growth has been around 6 percent a year in real terms during
1970, 1971 and 1972, a significant slowdown compared with the average annual
growth of 9 percent during the preceding four years. The most notable develop-
ments have been an absolute decline in private construction, which was partly
offset by large increases in expenditures of the public sector (more than 10
percent in 1971 and again in 1972).
4.        The chain of events underlying production performance appears to
have been as follows. After growing slowly for several years, exports of
goods and non-factor services showed unexpectedly large increases in 1971
(10 percent) and 1972 (13 percent) due to strong world demand for some of
Thailand''s main export commodities and revival of services to the US mili-
tary. As noted above, expenditures of the public sector for consumption
and investment also rose rapidly. However, the incremental incomes thus
generated were initially saved -- there is a lag of about 6 months in the
response of private consumption to changes in income and a lag of about 18
months in the response of private investment. Imports therefore stagnated
in 1971 and began to rise only in the first half of 1972, mostly for con-
sumption purposes. In addition, import demand was dampened by price increases
resulting from the Government decision in 1971 to peg the baht to the US dol-
lar, thus in effect devaluing the baht with respect to the currencies of some
of Thailand's main trading partners, Japan and Western European countries.
Rapid export growth and slow import growt4 strengthened the balance of pay-
ments. The external resource deficit declined from $317 million in 1970 to
an estimated $165 million in 1972. An inflow of external capital, of which
most was private and up to one third was short term (attracted by interest
rate differentials between Thai and foreign money markets) raised foreign
exchange reserves from $767 million at the end of 1970 to $920 million at
the end of August 1972. On the domestic side, the marked slowdown in private
investment and the simultaneous strong rise in private saving led to high
liquidity in the economy., which was reflected in the position of commercial



-2-
banks. Liquidity in the banking system was further increased by the lack
of flexibility in the interest rate policy and lending practices of com-
mercial banks.
5.       EWith a strengthened balance of payments and private investment
showing clear signs of improvement, the outlook earlier this year for
economic perfonrance in 1973 was bright. However, a drought last summer
is expected to affect adversely the production and export in 1973 of rice,
kenaf and especially maize. Merchandise exports are expected to show only
a very small increase and the same is expected of services to the US mili-
tary. This will come at a time when private investment will respond strongly
to previous increases in income. Demand for imports is therefore likely to
rise sharply and to put pressure on the external position. A reserve loss
of at least $50 million is forecast for 1973 despite a rising inflow of ex-
ternal private capital to finance private imports of equipment and durables.
However, the high level of foreign exchange reserves can be safely reduced
and this will help the economy ride out the setback in agriculture, which
hopefully will not occur again next year.
6.        The recent trend in budgetary savings is a cause for concern. Tax
revenue increased rapidly in fiscal 1972 (9 percent) and measures were taken
to raise additional revenue in fiscal 1973. However, Government spending on
current account is rising even more rapidly mainly to meet the needs of secur-
ity, education and debt service, as well as to provide for an increase in
Government salaries in fiscal 1973. As a result the current budgetary sur-
plus has been virtually eliminated, and capital expenditures have been
curtailed in fiscal 1972 and 1973 to keep the budget deficit within limits
compatible with price and external stability. It is urgent for the Govern-
ment to review its current spending and eliminate those items which lead to
excessive growth; some were identified in last year's basic report. However,
the Government is not well prepared to undertake such a review, which would
in any case be a lengthy process. In the meantime, additional tax revenue
will be needed, and the 02 billion target for this objective in the Third
Plan (10 percent of 1973 tax revenue) is a strict minimum for the remainder
of the Plan period.
7.        Thailand began its Third Five-Year Plan on October 1, 1971 aiming
at GDP growth of 7 percent a year. As noted, GDP growth was below target
in 1972 and may be so again in 1973. The expected stagnation of exports in
1973 may lead to another cycle of slow growth in domestic demand as happened
in 1970-72. ?hether the target growth rate can be achieved or exceeded in
later years of the Plan period will depend above all on the success of Govern-
ment efforts to promote production, particularly for export. Hence the neces-
sity for the Government to press on with the administrative reforms that would
make its support of private production activities more effective.
8.        This is particularly true in agriculture.   Beyond any doubt supply
is the bottleneck in the expansion of agricultural production and exports;



world demand for most Thai commodities is strong and expanding. A number of
crucial policy changes and development projects designed to relieve the pro-
duction bottleneck were listed in last year's basic report and agreed upon
with the Thai authorities. But the first year of the Plan has seen few steps
towards implementation. In fact, it is reported that the promotion of agri-
cultural export products and import substitutes (maize, soybean, silk, shrimp,
livestock, coconut, tobacco and cotton) was held back by insufficient budgetary
allocations. A major reorganization of services dealing with agriculture is
about to be made. It is hoped that when the reorganization is implemented
the Ministry of Agriculture will be in a position to increase-the effective-
ness of its assistance to farmers.
9.        In manufacturing, the situation is more promising.  Fiscal incentives
to exporters have been introduced and are being used. Authorization for the
establishment of duty free zones for export is imminent. More importantly
perhaps. several subsectors (for instance, textiles, cement, food processing
and wood working) are finding export markets profitable, and receive assist-
ance from the Government in their efforts to penetrate exte mal markets. The
ambitious Plan targets for exports of manufactures are likely to be exceeded.
Still, the collaboration between Government and industrialists could be
improved further. For instance, maritime freight rates seem to be excessive
and thus to reduce the price competitiveness of Thai manufactures abroad.
There is a need for close coordination between the Government and Thai export-
ers to negotiate rate reductions with the Conference shipping lines serving
the port of Bangkok.
10.       In addition to difficulties in production, problems of financial
management remain. The need for an increased tax effort has already been
highlighted. There is also a need to develop domestic financial institutions
which would mobilize long-term savings domestically and abroad for the financing
of private investment. This issue hinges essentially on changes in taxation
and regulations that would eliminate the existing discrimination against finan-
cial institutions other than commercial banks. In particular, institutions
specializing in the financing of agriculture, small industries and residential
construction should be encouraged as they could help raise the level of invest-
ment in these sectors by offering more suitable terms and services to borrowers.
Similarly, there is a need to develop domestic institutions which would borrow
on favourable terms from official sources of external capital for onlending
to private investors to finance equipment imports. These institutions could
in part replace foreign suppliers' credit and thus help reduce the growth of
Thailand's external debt service liabilities.
11.       The proposed loan to the Telephone Organization of Thailand is
part of the Government's program of external public borrowings during the
Third Plan period. This program, which calls for commitments of official
loans totalling about $900 million in 1972-76, was accepted by the Consul-
tative Group for Thailand in February 1972. After nearly one year, some
slippage may be observed due to delays in project preparation, particularly



-.4-
in agriculture. Preparation of suitable projects will require a great
deal of effort, and the Bank resident mission, which arrived in Bangkok
on October 15. will be able to help.
12.       Notwithstanding the recent improvement in the balance of pay-
ments the above public borrowings and the private borrowings required to
cover the prospective external resource deficit, while maintaining exchange
reserves at a safe level, are expected to push external debt service obli-
gations slightly above 20 percent of goods and non-factor services exports
by 1976 compared to 18 percent in 1971.   Longer-term prospects are for a
further increase of the debt service burden.   Nevertheless, Thailand has
a considerable margin of creditworthiness for borrowing on conventional
terms.   The growth of debt service can be mitigated by softer terms on the
official loans sought by the Government (for instance, IDA financing is
proposed for a forthcoming education project), and especially by taking
steps as explained in paragraph 10 to replace a part of suppliers' credit
by more favourable official loans to finance private equipment imports in
future.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THAILAND
13.       Since 1950, Thailand has received 24 Bank loans amounting to $403.0
million net of cancellations. The greater part of Bank assistance has been
for transportation ($154 million), irrigation ($69 million), power ($91 mil-
lion) and for a multi-purpose power and irrigation project ($66 million).
Two loans have been made for education and one for industry. In general
Bank financed projects have been carried out in accordance with expectations.
Construction of the Third Bangkok Port Project, financed under Loan 702-TH,
began 18 months behind schedule. The delay was mainly caused by the tinme
taken by the Port Authority of Thailand and its consultants to pre-qualify
bidders, amend tender documents and evaluate bids which were complicated
by currency realignments. Annex I contains a summary statement of Bank loans
and IFC investments as of September 30, 1972, and notes on the execution of
on-going projects.
14.       The bulk of Bank and IDA lending for the immediate future and pos-
sibly for the next few years will be directed towards helping Thailand meet
its infrastructure needs, and the Bank will address itself particularly to
priority areas such as the expansion of domestic and export agriculture,
education, social improvements including family planning, and regional pro-
jects to achieve a wider distribution of development benefits. One of the
main functions of the Resident Mission in Bangkok will be to assist the
Government in developing projects in these fields. IDA financing, while
softening the overall terms of our lending, will be employed to support
Thailand's efforts to tackle the problems of its less favoured regions.
Some financing of local costs in appropriate cases will enable the Bank
to participate more fully in basic developmental projects in agriculture,
education and social improvement. A Consultative Group for Thailand, which



-5-
is chaired by the Bank met last in February 1972 and the next meeting is
tentatively scheduled for March 1973.
15.       During the balan'ce of the current fiscal year, I expect to present
for your consideration loans and credits to assist the financing of seven
projects in Thailand. Negotiations for a fifth highway loan amounting to
about $32 million have been substantially completed. Negotiations for the
first IDA credit to Thailand, in an amount of about $15 million for a third
education project, are expected to begin shortly. A $5 million credit for
the Chao Phya (Central Plain) irrigation improvement project is under con-
sideration. A loan of about $37 million to help finance the modernization
program of the Royal State Railways and a loan of about $40 million for the
Bangkok water supply are also being considered.  A Northeast crop improvement
project and the Pitsanuloke irrigation project are scheduled to be appraised
shortly. Projects which are under consideration for FY 1974 include the multi-
purpose power and irrigation Quai Yai project as well as seed multiplication,
agricultural credit, industrial finance, industrial estates, port development
and Northeast urban infrastructure.  The Government of Japan, which in April
1972 signed a credit agreement totalling Yen 64 billion with the Government
of Thailand, has expressed an interest in participating in the financing of
the telecommunications project which is the subject of this report as well
as a number of the above-mentioned projects, in particular, the railways
project, the Bangkok water supply and the Quai Yai project.
16.       On December 31, 1971, Bank loans outstanding to Thailand amounted
to $238.2 million representing 31% of the country's total external debt of
$773 million.   The level of Bank/IDA commitments is expected to increase
substantially over the next five years but should not exceed 30% of the
projected external debt.  Japan, which had provided $60 million to help finance
the Second Plan (1967-71), has agreed to provide about $210 million for the
Third Plan.  Other lenders to Thailand, notably the US and the Asian Develop-
ment Bank, are planning to increase their commitments under the Third Plan.
PART III - THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
17.       The telecommunications sector in Thailand is undergoing rapid
development in an attempt to meet the increasing flow of business and
administrative information required to support Thailand's continued growth.
Existing facilities (as of iptember 1971) include 161,000 telephones in
Bangkok and 37,000 in the provinces. This represents a telephone density
of 0.54 per 100 population which is low and generally in line with that of
other countries of comparable per capita income.
18.       Telecommunication services in Thailand were initially operated
by the Government's Posts and Telegraphs Department (P&T). The Telephone
Organization of Thailand (TOT) was established in 1954 as a State enter-
prise by Act of Parliament for the purpose of organizing and improving
telecommunication services in the Bangkok-Thonburi area. In 1961 provin-
cial telephone services and long-distance facilities were also transferred
to TOT; hence TOT now operates all national telephone services, while P&T



-6-
operates all international services and domestic telegraph and telex
services, and is responsible for radio frequency allocation and control.
This arrangement works reasonably well. TOT operates along commercial
lines with an adequate degree of autonony. Swedish consultants (Swedtel)
are working with TOT to strengthen its organization and its planning and
operational procedures.
PART TV - THE PRDJECT
19.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Telecommunications Project of
the Telephone Organization of Thailand, Thailand (No. PU-99a dated October
27, 1972)" is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. A
loan and project summary is provided in Annex III.
The Program
20.       The project is part of TOT's development program which includes
the completion of on-going works and TOT's new 1972-1976 Development Plan.
The program will about double the capacity of the national network from the
present figure of around 200,000 exchange lines to 416,000 by September 1977;
the long distance network will increase from 856 channels to 2,345; and sub-
scriber trunk dialing (SM) will be introduced progressively from 1974. The
total cost of the program including increase of working capital is estimated
at $176.8 million.
The 1972-1976 Development Plan
21.       TOT's 1972-1976 Development Plan, which forms the major portion
of the program, will be carried out in two phases, the whole costing about
$14l6 million with a foreign exchange component of about $78 million. Phase
I, which constitutes the present project, will concentrate on expanding exist-
ing exchanges, providing new exchanges in central Bangkok, replacing small
manual exchanges in provincial networks with automatic exchanges of higher
capacity and providing new trunk routes to serve regional centers. Phase II,
for which major expenditures will begin in 1974, will provide new exchanges
in suburban Bangkok and the provinces, with associated trank provision. The
Plan will greatly improve existing telephone service and extend services to
rural communities at present without telephones. The vast majority of new
connections will be for business and agricultural purposes.
The Project
22.       The project, Phase I of the 1972-1976 Development Plan, comprises
the following main items:
(a) Installation of approximately 88,000 lines of automatic switching
equipment in the Bangkok metropolitan network (including replacement of 19,000
lines of obsolete equipment); three additional tandem exchanges to serve
Greater Bangkok; associated subscriber and junction line plant.



-7-
(b) Installation of approximately 43,000 lines of automatic
exchange equipment in provincial networks (including 7 new exchanges and
replacement of 31 obsolete manual exchanges); associated subscriber line
plant.
(c) Provision of approximately 500 circuits on 23 new trunk
routes with television bearers on selected routes; expansion of existing
routes by about 800 circuits; trunk switching equipment at 32 locations;
progressive introduction of subscriber trunk dialing from 1974.
(d) Studies of tariffs, organization and operations.
Details are in Annex III and in the Appraisal Report (PU-99a dated October 27,1972).
Financing Plan
23.       The following financing plan is based on T¶OT estimated requirements
of $176.8 million for its total development program over the period 1972-1976.
It includes Phase I, which constitutes the present project and a later but
overlapping Phase II, as well as on-going works.

Phase II                                 38.8

- 8 -
2L.       The table shows that TOT will be contributing about 37% of the
total requirements from internal sources. The Government has agreed to
contribute $29.8 million (18%) towards the costs of IGT's program of which
50 would be made available as loan and 50% as equity.    Following a recent
successful issue of bonds by the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand,
the Gove-nment is considering the possibility of a similar bond issue by TOT
to finance all or part of the Government's loan contribution towards the costs
of TOT's program. The proposed Bank loan would finance about 20% of total
requirements; this could rise to 32% if Bank financing is requested for the
full amount of the foreign exchange costs of Phase II.
25.       During preliminary discussions of this project with the Bank the
Government indicated that, while it intended to require international competi-
tive bidding, it also wished to hold open the possibility of utilising any
financing which might be available from official sources on terms more fav-.--
able than the proposed Bank loan.  In order to achieve this dual purpose, thle
qovernment enquired whether the Bank would be agreeable to cancelling a portion
of its loan in the event that, after international competitive bidding had
taken place, orders placed abroad could be financed on more favourable terms.
The Bank agreed to this procedure in the interest of reducing the overa'l cost
of borrowing for the project and to enable Thailand to take advantage of offers
of bilateral assistance on very concessional terms without losing the advantages
of international bidding.
The Proposed Loan
26.       The estimated cost (including taxes) of the project, Phase I of
the 1972-1976 Development Plan,is $102.8 million with a foreign exchange
component of about $56.6 million. The $102.8 million includes $2.1 million
for payments in 1977. Detailed cost estimates are provided in fnnex III.
The proposed Bank loan of $37 million will help finance the following items:
US$ million
Te-lephone cables, associated plant            15,110,000
Telephone exchange switching equipment          5,900,000
Subscriber apparatus, associated plant
and public telephones                           6,410,000
Transmission equipment                          6,320,000
Motor vehicles                                    30,o000
Consultants' services and training              1,770,000
TJnalloc ated                                   1,150,000
TOTAL           37,000,000
27.       TOT plans to obtain financing for the foreign exchange costs of
the remaining items totalling t19.6 million from bilateral loans and sup-
pliers credits, which TOT has successfully utilized in the past. The terms



-9-
of this financing have been generally appropriate. The Government has under-
taken to cover any financing gap.
Procurement and Disbursement
28.       All goods financed by the proposed loan would be purchased through
international competitive bidding, with the exception of extensions to certain
exchanges where direct compatibility is essential for efficient use of existing
equipment. These extensions would be purchased from the original suppliers,
ITT (Pentaconta equipment) and L.M. Ericsson, at prices based on contracts
awarded in 1969 and 1971, respectively, after international competitive bid-
ding. The cost of such direct procurement should not exceed US$3.1 million -
about 8% of the loan amount. No retroactive financing will be necessary. A
preference of up to 15% or the applicable customs duty, whichever is lower,
would be applied to bids from local manufacturers. Thailand has no agreements
giving preferential tariffs to any foreign country. Disbursements under the
loan are set out in Annex III and would be for the CIF costs of imported equip-
ment, or the ex-factory costs of locally manufactured items and for the foreign
exchange costs of consultant's services and training.
Project Execution
29.       Responsibility for the execution of the project, which will be
undertaken over the five year period, FY 1972-1976, rests with TOT which
has successfully carried out similar but smaller expansion programs in the
past. TOT intends to install equipment for expansion of existing installa-
tions with its own personnel, under the supervision of the suppliers; new
installations would be carried out under suppliers' contracts. Cable instal-
lations will be executed by TOT with the exception that international tenders
will be called for new major works in Bangkok.  Buildings, access roads and
major duct routes would be built by contractors after local bidding. As with
TOT's previous and current expansion plans, consultants would be employed to
assist in the preparation of specifications, supervision of the project and
acceptance testing. Existing training arrangements are adequate and include
a large, well equipped telecommunications training centre near Bangkok and
the provision of training under contract by equipment suppliers.
TOT's Financial Situation
30.       During the period of the 1972-1976 Development Plan, TOT's total
assets are projected to increase from $102.3;million equivalent to $243.3
million. The main feature of the financing plan is the substantial increase
in the use of debt financing. Borrowings would finance 54% of total require-
ments over the next 5 years and TOT's debt/equity ratio would rise from 24/76
to 48/52. In view of the heavy reliance on debt, TOT has agreed to maintain
a debt service coverage of 1.5 on all future long-term borrowing. TOT's rate
of return on average net plant in service over the past 4 years has ranged from
8.8% to 11.4%. TOT has begun a review of its tariffs, which have not substan-
tially changed since 1962. The new level of tariffs to be introduced will,



- 10 -
during the project period, generate revenues not less than those generated
under existing tariffs and thereafter be maintained at a level sufficient
to earn a minimum rate of return of 105. The new tariffs, which will be
introduced according to an agreed timetable, will include tariffs applicable
to and payable by the Government.   The G:vernment has further agreed to
settle its arrears to TOT within four years.
Benefits
31.       The basic justification for TMT's development program, and thus
the Droject, is to support Thailand's development objectives by providing
an essential service for the Thai economy.    Efficient organization of the
flow of inputs for the production, distribution and marketing of goods will
be greatly assisted by improved communications. Development of the provinces,
which is a particular objective of the Government, will be supported by im-
proving the existing long distance service and extending service to rural areas
-which now have no telephones.   Considerable expansion of the national telecom-
munications network is necessary to meet even the oresent unsatisfied demand.
Tne financial rate of return for the project, calculated on the basis of present
charges, is estimated to be 1h% and is unlikely under the least favourable comnbina-
tion of circumstances to fall below 11%.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHOPITY
32.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Telephone
Organization of Thailand, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Kingdom
of Thailand and the Bank, the report of the Committee provided for in Article
III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of the Resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft Agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans for
telecommunications projects.
33.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
3h.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan 471-TH, First Education Project (Vocational Education)
As a result of incomplete bidding for tools and scientific equip-
ment, the closing date of Loan 471-TH was postponed a second time to allow
for re-bidding; the first postponement was necessary-due to delays in appoint-
ing experts under bilateral assistance. It is expected that the project will
be satisfactorily completed before the new closing date of August 31, 1973.
Loan 514-TH, Sirikit Dam Project
The work on the project has been practically completed. The closure
of the dam was carried out on schedule in June 1971. The reservoir is expected
to be filled to full retention capacity this month. The total cost of the project
is estimated at US$78 million as against US$76 million at appraisal (+2.5%).
Substantial increases in the principal civil works contract (+411), which
resulted from unforeseen adverse foundation conditions, have been compensated
by savings on other items. Loan disbursements are expected to be completed
about 6 months prior to the closing date of the Loan, June 30, 1973.
Loan 535-TH, Third Highways Project
The project has been largely completed. At the request of the
Highways Department the closing date of the loan has been extended by a
period of six months until March 31, 1973, to allow for the completion of
work, the settlement of outstanding claims on construction contract already
carried out and the payment of consultants costs for completing the design of
feeder roads to be constructed under the proposed 5th highways project.
Loan 626-TH, 4th Highways Project
Construction of the project is on schedule and within the cost
estimates.
Loan 655-TH, First EGAT Power Project
WTork on the project is on schedule. The Electricity Generating
Authority of Thailand (EGAT) has placed orders for equipment but is not re-
quired to make substantial payments until it is shipped.
Loan 702-TH, Third Bangkok Port Project
As mentioned in paragraph 13 of the report, construotion of this
project began 18 months behind schedule. The delay was mainly caused by the
time taken by the Port Authority of Thailand and its consultants to pre-qualify
bidders, amend tender documents and evaluate bidds which were complicated by
currency realignments.
Loan 790-TH, South Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 4 Project
The loan became effective on January 27, 1972. Similarly with Loan
655-TH, EGAT has placed orders for equipment for which payment is not yet due.

Loan 822-TH, Second Education Project (Kasetsart University)
The loan was declared effective on August 22, 1972. There has
been some delay in appointing the campus planners but    construction is expected
to be completed and work begin in the immediate future.
