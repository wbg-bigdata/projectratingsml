THAIIBND
TELEPHONE ORGANIZATION OF THAILAND
APPRAISAL OF A TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The project appraised in this report is the first phase of the
1572-76 development plan of the Telephone Organization of Thailand (TOT),
the State enterprise responsible for the national telephone services.
A Bank loan of US$37 million equivalent is proposed. This would be the
first Bank operation in support of the telecommunications sector in
Thailand.
ii.       As part of Thailand's Third National Development Plan (1972-76),
TOT's development plan aims at improving and approximately doubling the
domestic telephone system by installing about 166,000 more exchange lines,
replacing obsolete equipment and adding long-distance facilities, at a
total cost estimated at US$146.1 million equivalent.  Together with the
completion of ongoing works, this will increase the capacity of the
telephone system from approximately 200,000 exchange lines at present to
416,000 in 1977. The vast majority of new connections will be for business
purposes and will meet about 65% of the estimated total demand.
iii.      The plan divides conveniently into two overlapping phases, which
are defined largely by lead times for procurement and by service priorities.
The first phase is a suitable unit for Bank financing and constitutes the
project.
iv.       The project consists of installing 88,100 exchange lines in
Greater Bangkok and 42,700 in provincial networks; enlarging the long-
distance network by adding about 1,300 circuits and associated trunk
switching equipment; and progressively introducing subscriber trunk
dialing (STD), commencing in 1974.
v.        The estimated cost of the project is US$102.8 million equiva-
lent, including a foreign exchange cost of US$56.6 million equivalent.
The amount proposed for the Bank loan would finance 65% of the foreign
cost, with the remaining 35% to be financed by bilateral loans. The Thai
Government wishes to reserve the right to reduce the amount of the Bank
loan if subsequently it is able to obtain additional bilateral credit on
terms more favorable than those of the Bank loan.
vi.       All equipment financed by the Bank would be procured by inter-
national competitive bidding, except selected extensions to exchanges
where direct compatibility is essential for efficient operation. These
extensions, estimated to cost US$3.1 million equivalent, would be bought
from suppliers of the original equipment at prices based on earlier



- ii-
contracts awarded after widespread international bidding. A preference
of 15% or the customs duty, whichever is lower, would be applied to local
manufacturers' cables. The principal items financed by the Bank would be
telephone cables (US$15.1 million), switching equipment (US$5.9 million),
telephone sets (US$6.4 million), and transmission equipment (US$6.3 million).
Training, consultants and miscellaneous items would account for US$3.3
million of the Bank loan.
vii.      TOT has adequate autonomy and, overall, its organization and
management are adequate but need strengthening in certain operational and
financial areas. Consultants have given TOT assistance in the past, and
would continue to do so during the project period.
viii.     TOT's past operating results have been satisfactory and its
present financial position is sound; but with the high rate of capital
expansion, forecasts show a financing gap of about US$30 million equiva-
lent during the years 1973-1975. It was recommended and agreed with
Government that this deficit would be covered by Government subscribing
50% of the amount as equity and providing or arranging loans (including
possible bond issues by TOT) for the remaining 50%. On this basis, forecasts
show that TOT should be able to carry out the expansion progran and continue
to maintain a satisfactory financial position. The present overall level
of tariffs is reasonable, pexmitting TOT sufficient revenue to cover its
financial requirements, including financing an adequate portion of its
capital expansion from internal sources. However, some changes in the
tariff structure are necessary.
ix.       Government is tardy in paying its bills and the method used for
settling its local telephone service accounts is not satisfactory to TOT.
TOT will be required to correct these deficiencies, and satisfactory arrange-
ments were agreed during negotiations.
x.        The project will provide for an annual increase in telephone
subscribers of about 12% up to 1977. The economic rate of return on the
project is estimated to be at least 14%.
xi.       With the assurances indicated in Chapter 7, the project forms a
suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$37 million equivalent over a term of
20 years, including four years of grace.



THAILAND
TELEPHONE ORGANIZATION OF THAILAND
APPRAISAL OF A TELECOMMNICATIONS PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Thailand has requested Bank assistance in
financing a major phase of telecommunications expansion under Thailand's
Third National Development Plan (1972-76). The project is estimated to
cost US$102.8 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
US$56.6 million equivalent.
1.02      A Bank loan of US$37 million is proposed, covering some two-
thirds of the project's foreign cost, and would be made to the Telephone
Organization of Thailand (TOT), the State enterprise which operates the
country's domestic telephone services. This would be the Bank's first
loan for telecommunications in Thailand.
1.03      The project would expand the national telephone network through
installation of 88,100 exchange lines and tandem exchanges in Bangkok and
42,700 lines in the provincial networks, 1,300 long-distance circuits,
and trunk switching equipment. Service would be substantially improved
and would be extended to rural areas presently without telephones.
1.04      This report is basedl on information provided by TOT and on the
findings of an appraisal mission composed of Messrs. I. A. Newstead,
J. M. Vance, N. R. Holcer and R. Schkolnick, which visited Thailand in
March 1972.

2. ITE SECTOR
Economic Setting
2.01      Thailand occupies an irregular area of 514,000 km2 that narrows
as it extends down the Malay Peninsula. The population, estimated at 38.3
million, is growing at an annual rate of 3.1% and the GNP per capita is
around Us$180.
2.02      During 1966-69, the Thai economy experienced a high GDP growth
rate, averaging 9% per year, but subsequently went through a period of
slowdown. With a large increase in exports in 1971, economic growth
started to regain its momentum in the second half of that year. The
Government's objective during the Third Plan period, 1972-76, is to achieve
an annual GDP growth rate of 7%. While agriculture still makes the largest
contribution to GDP (30%) and provides employment to nearly 80% of Thailand's
labor force, manufacturing is expanding at about double the rate of agricul-
ture, keeping its share of GDP at about 15%; tourism is growing in importance
as a foreign exchange earner. Rice is produced throughout the country as
the staple food of the Thai people and is also the main export. Other major
exports include rubber, produced in the southern region and along the
Cambodian border; maize, in the northeastern plateau; and tin, in the
southern region. Industrial development has so far been heavily concen-
trated in the Greater Bangkok area, chiefly because of its superior commer-
cial, public utility and port facilities. Now an important objective of
the Third Plan is to reduce the regional disparities; this calls for special
efforts to develop the outlying regions, particularly the Northeast, which
is the poorest.
2.03      The telecommunications system is undergoing rapid development to
handle the increasing flow of b-asiness and administrative information re-
quired to support Thailand's continued growth. The processing and trans-
port of raw materials, manufactured goods and agricultural produce between
Bangkok and the provincial centers and the efficient marketing, dispatching,
warehousing and shipping of the country's products require good telecommuni-
cations service, as does the growing tourism industry. The present low
telephone density of 0.54 per 100 population is in line with that of other
countries of comparable per capita income level (see Annex 1).
Sector Organization
2.04      Telecommunication services in Thailand were initially operated
by the Government's Posts and Telegraphs Department (P&T). The Telephone
Organization of Thailand (TOT) was established in 1954 as a State enter-
prise by Act of Parliament, for the purpose of organizing and improving
telecommunication services in the Bangkok-Thonburi area. The Act is
administered by the Minister of Communications, whose portfolio includes
P&T. In 1961, provincial telephone services and long-distance facilities
were also transferred to TOT; hence TOT now operates all the national tele-
phone services, while P&T operates all the international services and the
domestic telegraph and telex services, and is responsible for radio
frequency allocation and control.



2.05      Although the separation of telephone and telegraph/telex facil-
ities has some disadvantages, the arrangement is working reasonably well
in Thailand. P&T leases local cable pairs and high-grade trunk circuits
from TOT when required and owns the older, open-wire telegraph circuits.
The form of a possible merger has many variations and within Government
the whole question is controversial. The present sector organization is
acceptable to the Bank for the current program and project; assurances
were obtained during negotiations that the Bank will be consulted before
any changes affecting TOT's overall organization or responsibilities are
made.  Meanwhile, technical coordination between TOT and P&T needs
strengthening and it was agreed that joint engineering committees would
be set up to deal with planning and operational matters. It was confirmed
during negotiations that this action has been taken.
2.06      The telecommunication industry in Thailand consists mainly of
two privately owned cable factories, which produce mainly power cables but
also small-sized plastic-insulated telephone cables. The establishment
of a factory for partial manufacture and assembly of selected trans-
mission equipment, and local manufacture of switching equipment are also
being considered.
Existing Facilities
2.07      TOT's existing (September 1971) facilities are summarized as
follows:
Bangkok Metropolitan Network
Number of exchanges
Local                                        23
Metropolitan tandems                          4
Main trunk                                    1
Number of local lines installed            162,300
Number of lines connected (DEL's)          105,550
Number of telephones                       161,192
Provincial Networks
Number of exchanges
Local                                        79
Trunk switching                              22
Number of local lines installed             37,060
Number of lines connected (DEL's)           31,198
Number of telephones                        36,680
Long-Distance Network
Number of circuits                             856



2.08      Work has now been virtually completed on two earlier expansion
plans: Bangkok 1967-72, which has added 102,000 exchange lines, and
Long Distance 1967-72, which has provided 18 spur routes. The national
network is currently being expanded by two other major plans:
(i)  Bangkok 1970-74 - installation of a further 38,000 exchange
lines with associated subscribers' and junction plant. This
plan supplements the above Bangkok 1967-72 Plan and caters
for increased demand.
(ii)  Provincial 1967-74 - installation of 37,600 exchange lines
in 59 locations with associated subscriber plant, and
19 trunk switching installations.
2.09      The types and capacities of exchange equipment are shown in
Annex 2. Since 1967, TOT has adopted register-controlled crossbar switch-
ing equipment as its network standard.  In the Bangkok network, 13,000
exchange lines of obsolete step-by-step equipment are being replaced by
crossbar equipment in the Bangkok 1970-74 Plan; the remaining 19,000
will be replaced in the 1972-76 Development Plan (described in Chapter 3).
Provincial equipment is being converted progressively from manual to
automatic (crossbar) operation, with the remaining manual exchanges
scheduled for replacement during the 1972-76 period.
2.10      Local-line plant consists mainly of underground cables for
primary distribution and junctions, with overhead cables in the secondary
distribution networks.
2.11      The long-distance toll facilities consist of microwave broad-
band systems installed in 1967 on backbone routes serving the main regional
centers, and low-capacity (less than 300 channels) radio systems with some
carrier cables for spur routes.
2.12      International facilities, operated by P&T, consist of circuits
through two earth stations working with the Pacific and Indian Ocean
satellites, supplemented by HF radio circuits.
Service Standards
2.13      Local service has improved considerably in the last few years
but there is still much to be done to attain acceptable standards by
reducing faults and eliminating traffic bottlenecks. The cost of provid-
ing good service is only 5-10% of the basic network expenditures, whereas
poor service standards result in a virtual breakdown of the whole system
when even minor overloading occurs.
2.14      Although the long-distance semiautomatic service is operating
reasonably well, traffic through the main Bangkok trunk exchange now
exceeds the capacity of manual operator positions and there are frequently
delays of up to an hour in completing calls during busy periods. These
delays will increase as trunk traffic grows until relief is given by the
progressive introduction of STD commencing in 1974.



2.15      Action is in hand with the assistance of Swedish consultants
(Swedtel) to improve maintenance standards (see paragraph 5.05). The
following measures were also recommended to upgrade the overall quality
of service:
(a) Traffic measurement procedures should be reinforced and
traffic forecasting methods reviewed, with the assistance
of Swedtel.
(b)  Independent assessments of the quality of service should be
introduced, with periodic reports to TOT's management on
the quality of local and long distance service.
TOT agreed with these recommendations, and confirmation that appropriate
action has been taken was obtained during negotiations.

3. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
3.01      Rapid growth of telephone demand in Thailand in recent years
has necessitated overlapping stages of development to meet the changing
needs of the national telephone system.
3.U2      TOT's total investmen- program for the five fiscal years 1972-1976
is given in Annex 3 and is also summarized graphically in the chart follow-
ing that armex. The program consists essentially of completion of ongoing
works in the Bangkok 1970-74 and Provincial 1967-74 Plans, and execution
of a major new expansion plan -- the 1972-76 Development Plan, covering
the Bangkok, provincial and long-distance networks. Total investment for
the 1972-76 period is estimated at US$168 million i/ with a foreign exchange
component of US$87 million. The program will approximately double the
capacity of the national network from the present figure of around 200,000
exchange lines to 416,000 by September 1977; the long-distance network will
increase from 856 channels at present to 2,345; and subscriber trunk dialing
(STD) will be introduced progressively from 1974. Annex 4 gives details of
the year-by-year development targets.
3-03      The 1972-76 Development Plan -- the major undertaking in the
program -- is scheduled in two overlapping phases in which 166,360 exchange
lines and 26,240 replacement lines will be installed and long-distance
facilities added.  The Plan will greatly3 improve telephone service where
it is now provided and will extend such service to rural communities at
present without telephones. Its total cost is US$146.1 million 2/
(including a foreign exchange component of US$78.5 million), which repre-
sents a continuation of the rate of increase of investment needed to
sustain an annual network growth of 12-14%. The timing and composition
of the two phases are dictated largely by procurement lead times and
service priorities. Phase I concentrates on expanding the existing ex-
changes, addiig local and tandim oxrl1iages in  ontral Baugkolc, replaoing
small irianual exchalnges in provincial networks with automatic exchanges
(of higher capacity) and providing new trunk routes to serve the regional
centers. Phase II concentrates on providing new exchanges in suburban
Bangkok and the provinces, with associated trunk provision.
The Project
3.04      The project proposed for initial Bank assistance is Phase I of
the 1972-76 Development Plan; a future loan could be considered for
Phase II. The project consists of the following main items:
1/    Excludes US$9.4 million to be spent in 1977.
2/    Includes US$6.8 million to be spent in 1977.



- 7 -
(i) Installation of 88,100 lines of automatic switching equipment
in the Bangkok metropolitan network (including replacement of
19,000 lines of obsolete equipment); three additional tandem
exchanges to serve Greater Bangkok; associated subscribers'
and junction line plant.
(ii) Installation of 142,700 lines of automatic exchange equipment
in provincial networks (including 7 new exchanges and replace-
ment of 31 obsolete manual exchanges); associated subscribers'
line plant.
(iii)  Provision of about 500 circuits on 23 new trunk routes with
TV bearers on selected routes; expansion of existing routes
by about 800 circuits; trunk switching equipment at 32 loca-
tions; progressive introduction of STD from 1974.
(iv) Training and consultancy services, to include technical and
management training, organization studies and project
supervision.
Exchange works proposed for Phase I are listed in Annex 2, together with
works scheduled for Phase II. The proposed development of the long-
distance network is shown on the telecommunications map.
Cost Estimates
3.05      The project is estimated to cost US$102.8 million, with a
foreign exchange component of US$56.6 million. Details are summarized
in the following table and the yearly expenditures are shown in Annex 5.

3.06      These estimated costs give a figure of around US$650 per DEL for local
network service. This is reasonable for the scope of work, which includes estab-
lishment of three new tandem (traffic routing) exchanges with associated cable
routes, to service the growing areas of Greater Bangkok.



-9-
Contingencies
3.07      Telecommunications development is a continuous process that occurs
through the installation and augmentation of plant at thousands of locations
in any program year. While some works will cost more due, for example, to
striking rock beds or to adverse weather when laying a cable, there will be
others where conditions will result in less than average costs.  Because of
this wide spread in costs, plus the variety of telecommunication works, the
overall risk of a cost overrun due to physical contingencies is small; in
any case, it would result in only a slight rephasing and retiming of target
objectives. For these reasons, the only physical contingency provision is
US$1.15 million equivalent for possible increases in quantities of provin-
cial cable plant which may be needed when the network requirements are more
precisely known, and for additional long-distance switching equipment to
cope with unforeseen growth of trunk traffic with the introduction of STD;
this represents a contingency of about 20% on the items concerned.
3.08      Any overall increase in the cost of the project due to price
increases would likewise result in a corresponding rephasing of target
objectives. No price contingency is required for the foreign exchange
costs of either switching equipment or cables (which represent over 80%
of the cost of imported items) since cost estimates are based on recent
bids and these prices should also apply during the procurement phase.
3.09      Local costs include an in-built provision for wage increases
at around 4% per annum; this has been the trend over recent years and is
expected to continue. A local cost contingency of US$2.14 million equiva-
lent is included mainly for possible increases in land and building costs
which are sensitive to upswings in the economy; this represents a contingency
of about 20% on these costs.

3.10      Items for Bank financing are:

3.11      The Thai Government wishes to reserve the right to utilize,
wherever practicable, bilateral sources of financing which are available
on favorable terms; this could reduce effective utilization of the Bank
loan below US$37 million, depending on the countries in which future procure-
ment awards are made following international bidding according to normal
Bank procedures.
Procurement
3.12      All goods financed by the Bank loan would be purchased through
international competitive bidding, with the exception of extensions to
certain trunk and local exchanges where direct compatibility is essential
for efficient use of existing common-control equipment. These extensions
would be purchased from the original suppliers, ITT (Pentaconta equipment)
and L.M. Ericsson, at prices based on contracts awarded in 1969 and 1971,
respectively, after international competitive bidding. The cost of such
direct procurement (included under Items 3(a) and 4(a) of the table of
costs) should not exceed US$3.1 million -- about 8% of the loan amount.
A preference of up to 15% or the applicable customs duty, whichever is lower,
would be applied to bids from local manufacturers. Thailand has no agree-
ments giving preferential tariffs to any foreign country.
Disbursements
3.13      The Bank loan would be disbursed against the CIF costs of imported
equipment, the foreign exchange cost of consulting services and the ex-factory
cost less local taxes of any locally awarded contracts for goods specified
under the loan. This would be mainly for smaller size cables for which the
local currency component would be unlikely to exceed US$2 million equivalent.
The estimated schedule of disbursements is in Annex 6. As the project forms
part of a continuing investment program, any unused balance of the loan
could, after consultation with the Bank, be used for the purchase of addi-
tional plant of similar types -- unless it should be cancelled for reasons
mentioned in paragraph 3.11.
Ececution
3.1i      TOT intends to install equipment for expansion of existing
installations with its own personnel, under the supervision of the suppliers;
new installations would be carried out under suppliers' contracts. Cable
installations, with the exception of new major works in Bangkok for which
international tenders would be called, would be executed by TOT; buildings
and access roads would be built by contractors after local bidding. This
is a reasonable division for installation and civil works, in light of TOT's
workforce.
3.15      As with TOT's previous and current expansion plans, consultants
will be employed to assist in the preparation of specifications, super-
vision of the project and acceptance testing. Their costs would be financed
by the loan (see also paragraphs 5.05 and 5.09).



- 11 -
3.16      For the progressive introduction of STD commencing in 1974,
there is need to prepare a coordinated plan covering:
(a) Tariff structure -- trunk rates and method of charging;
grouping of exchanges;
(b)  Bquipment and additional trunk circuit requirements and
cost estimates;
(c)  Implementation timetable; and
(d)  Coordination and public education program.
This studr is being made with the assistance of consultants (Swedtel) and
copies of preliminary reports covering tariff proposals and circuit require-
ments have been supplied to the Bank. Daring negotiations it was confirmed
that the STD implementation plan will be completed early in 1973.
3.17      Augmented by the training programs referred to in paragraphs 5.06
and 5.07 and with the outside assistance indicated in paragraph 3.14, the
personnel of TOT should be adequate to implement the project successfully
and subsequently maintain the new installations.

4. PROGRAM AND PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
4.01      The basic justification for th.e program, and thus the project,
is to support Thailand's development objectives by providing an essential
service for Thai industry and agriculture.  Efficient organization of the
flow of inputs for the production, distribution and marketing of manufac-
tured goods depends on access to rapid and reliable comunnications.
Agriculture, with its wide dispersion of production (see paragraph 2.02),
has similar requirements. Development of the provinces, which is a partic-
ular objective of the Government, will be supported by improving the exist-
ing long distance service and extending service to rural areas which now
have no telephones. Considerable expansion of the national telecommunica-
tions network is necessary to meet even the presently extensive unsatisfied
demand. In Bangkok, TOT discontinued waiting lists a few years ago when
there was little prospect of giving service to the large number of appli-
cants. Business men have been prepared to pay many times the official
installation cost whenever this could help them get connected to the
network.
Market Demand
4.02      Historical and forecast telephone demand for Greater Bangkok
and the provinces is shown in the two graphs following Annex 7. By 1977
there will be some 263,000 DEL's connected in Greater Bangkok and 68,ooo
in the provinces, equivalent in total to about 65% of the demand forecast
for that time. The vast majority of new connections will be for business
and agricultural purposes (see also paragraph 6.o4).  The average annual
increase in DEL's for the period 1972-77 is 12.2%.
4.03      Because waiting lists for Bangkok are not kept, both the 1970
and future demand (1980, 1990) were estimated on the basis of field surveys
which assessed directly the telephone potential of each building block;
thus the forecast estimates connected subscribers as well as the hidden
demand. Annex 7 (pages 1 - 5) describes how the estimates were made.
There is little danger of over-investment; the planned increase in
capacity is well below the deinand forecast.
4.04      The starting point in estimating provincial demand was the
number of subscribers connected plus the waiting list; estimated growth
rates of 15% and 10% per year were applied as being reasonable upper and
lower limits of growth. These forecasts are conservative since they take
no account of present hidden demand. The sizes of the exchanges to be
built are the most economic of the alternatives, and an exchange fill 1/
of 80% will be achieved by 1979.
1/    The percentage of the exchange line capacity which is connected
to working services.



- 13 -
4.05      The additional trunk network facilities are essential to relieve
congestion, give trunk-line service to places without trunk access, and
provide the circuit capacity necessary to meet forecast demand with the
introdaction of STD in 1974.
Least-Cost Solution
4.06      The least-cost method of meeting the demand forecast depends on
(i) having made the correct technological/economic decisions initially
when planning the networks, and (ii) following an optimum path in the
design, dimensioning and timing of the thousands of installations compris-
ing the continuous development process.
4.07      Fundamental decisions establishing Thailand's basic network over
the next decade were made some few years ago. They included the national
numbering, switching and transmission plans; the choice of crossbar switch-
ing equipment as the national standard; and the choice and disposition of
microwave and cable systems Afor the long-distance network. These deci-
sions were s. lmdly based and provide a satisfactory framework for future
development. A national charging plan is being prepared, defining the
grouping of exchanges and number analysis required for STD (see
paragraph 3.16).
4.08      Optimum engineering design of large works in the project has
been achieved by making present-value studies of alternatives over a
typical 20-year period. For the small projects, generalized solutions
were obtained for the various classes of plant from which particular
types and sizes of plant are selected. Reintroduction of waiting lists
for the Greater Bangkok area, however, is essential to ascertain priori-
ties in providing distribution cables. Compilation of waiting lists for
each exchange was recommended, and during negotiations TOT confirmed that
this is being done, and should be completed by June 1973.
4.09      TOT agreed during appraisal that STD should be introduced
progressively, commencing in 197L. The introduction of STD is a logical
step in the most economic development of the trunk network. It requires
only small additions of equipment to existing plant and obviates large
investment in additional manual trunk switchboards as well as the anrmal
costs of operating them, thereby giving better service at lower cost.
Because of the high rate of growth of trunk traffic there will be no
reduction in telephone operators, who will be still required for manual
assistance.
4.10      The proposed replacement of the remaining 19,000 lines of
step-by-step equipment in the Bangkok metropolitan network (see
paragraph 3.04(i)) will avoid continuing probleme of interworking with
the growing crossbar sector of the network, which call for complex and
costly signalling conversion equipment and severely limit flexibility
in assigning numbers as the networks expand. However, because of the



- 14 -
large unsatisfied demand, postponing this replacement until Phase II of
the program would have enabled TOT to use the new equipment to connect
ore subscribers earlier in the fire-year period. But since the supply
and installation of switching equipment must be committed well in advance,
and network planning and equipment specifications have already progressed
to the stage where any major change would cause extensive delays, with
even greater disadvantages, the present replacement plans merit inclusion
in the project.
Rate of Return
4.11      The financial rate of return was calculated on the basis of
actual charges; it was determined by equalizing the present values of
expenditures and related increases in revenues at 1971 prices and is
estimated to be 14% (see Annex 8). The least favorable combination of
circumstances, when construction costs increased by 10%, operating costs
increased by 10%, and the rate of growth was 10% less than current
projections, lowered the financial rate of return to 11%.

5. THE BORROMER
Legal Status and Authority
5.01      The Borrower would be the Telephone Organization of Thailand
(TOT). TOT is a State enterprise and operates along commercial lines
with a reasonable degree of autonomy. However, its investment plans and
annual capital budgets, like those of all State enterprises, have to be
approved by the Government; this has in the past imposed lengthy delay.
This problem, which was candidly summarized in an "epilogue" to TOT's
1970 annual report (see Annex 9), has since diminished with improved
working of the governmental machinery.
Organization and Management
5.02      An organization chart for TOT is in Annex 10. Its Board of
Directors consists of the Minister of Communications (Chairman), the
Managing Director and five members, together with an Adviser and a
Secretary. Two of the present members and the Adviser are military
generals, and three members are senior civil servants. Commerce and
industry are not represented on the Board; the advantages of such repre-
sentation are felt to be outweighed by the risks of commercial interests
lobbying through the Board.
5.03      The Board lays down policy and, under the Act, has the respon-
sibility "to supervise, in general, the affairs of the Telephone Organi-
zation". In practice, the Managing Director properly assumes fall
responsibility for TOT's operations, for which he has adequate authority.
5.04      TOT is fortunate in having an exceptionally able Managing
Director and a cadre of senior engineers and a financial manager who are
well-qualified (many have obtained graduate degrees abroad), dedicated
and competent. However, there is a need for closer integration of
engineering and financial planning -- for example, in assessing the full
implications of alternative courses of network development (see also
paragraph 4.10). Management at the lower levels is understandably less
impressive and there is a shortage of experienced first-line supervisors
that will require time as well as training (see paragraph 5.07) to overcome.
5.05      With the continued emphasis on expansion, too much of the avail-
able talent has been concentrated in the Planning and Project Department,
leaving the Operations Department relatively weak. Also, maintenance is
highly centralized to the extent of undermining the responsibilities of
the field supervisors. These problems are now recognized by TOT and
action is in hand to rectify the situation, with assistance from Swedtel,
which has carried out extensive studies of TOT's organization and opera-
tions. Since 1969 Swedtel has had a team of consultants, presently five,
working with TOT; the terms of reference for the current activities are
given in Annex 11. Swedtel assistance will continue during the project



- 16 -
period under a proposed new contract which is expected to be finalized by
December 31, 1972. During negotIiations it was confirmed that TOT will
submit, for Bank agreenent, the draft terms of reference and contract.
Subsequently, TOT will send the Bank time schedules, and progress reports
on the work every six months, beginning with the first month after the
loan is signed. (See also paragraph 5.09.)
Staff and Training
5.06      TOT has a total staff of approximately 6,600, corresponding to
27 staff per 1,000 telephones as compared with 31 in 1966. While this is
a satisfactory overall ratio (see Annex 1), there is a shortage of tech-
nical personnel that is masked by the high number of clerical and other
non-technical staff (3,300); no detailed breakdown by classification was
available during appraisal. TOT agreed to review the present staffing
structure and prepare a recruiting and training plan covering the project
period. During negotiations a copy of the plan was supplied to the Bank.
It provides for an overall staff increase of 53% (to 10,200), with a
further decrease in the number of staff per 1,000 telephones from 27 at
present, to 24 in 1976. No increase in non-technical staff is proposed
during this period.
5.07      Existing training facilities are adequate. Near Bangkok there
is a large,well-equipped telecommunications training center, constructed
as a -UNDP project during the past five years. It has a staff of 46 instruc-
tors, and provides comprehensive telecommunications training for technicians
and engineers, as well as selective training in finance and management. The
current annual output is 144 graduates, which can be readily expanded to
meet TOT's additional requirements under the project. Training both in
Thailand and overseas has also been provided under contract by equipment
suppliers, and it is proposed to continue this practice under the project.
Accounting and Audit
5.08      TOT's accounting system does not have an appropriate schedule
of accounts for a telephone utility.  The expense classifications do not
conform to the major functions of the entity, thus making it difficult
for management to assess in any depth the information now received.
This also inhibits the forecasting of operating results for a given net-
work expansion. There are not enough qualified senior financial staff
and, in general, the accounting system is not oriented to provide manage-
ment with timely information.
5.09      The Managing Director is keenly aware of these deficiencies and
is taking steps that will begin to correct them. He has brought in a
financial director who appears to have the background, temperament and
drive to improve TOT's financial operations. Also, other trained finan-
cial staff are being added, some of whom have had financial training



- 17 -
abroad. Swedtel will review TOT's overall financial operations (includ-
ing the accounting and budgeting systems, management reporting, stores
stock control, and billing and collections), make recommendations and
assist TOT's staff in implementing them. (See also paragraphs 3.15
and 5.05.)
5.10      The Act stipulates that the National Audit Council will perform
an annual audit and examination of TOT's accounts and financlal position,
and submit the results to the Council of Ministers within 120 days of the
end of TOT's fiscal year. The Act also stipulates that TOT will publish
an annual report, including certified balance sheet and profit-and-loss
account, within 150 days of the end of the fiscal year.  The present audit
is weak. There are lengthy delays (up to 10 months) befcre the final
accounts become available and the audit appears to be rat'aer superficial,
dealing with matters of detail rather than substance.
5.11      Agreement was reached during negotiations that ir, order to
assist the National Audit Council (NAC) in meeting Bank aud_ requirements,
the Bank would provide a description of the type and scopw  of audit which
should be covered in NAC's annual audit report on the Bo-rower. It was
further agreed that after two years, with the compl-tion of the audit for
fiscal year ending September 30, 1974, if the audit requires strengthen-
ing in order to meet Bank requirements, the Guarantor and -Borrower will
take all measures necessary to improve the audit, inc.3-dirg if necessary,
the engagement of a commercial audit firm to assist the NK. in performing
the audit and/or training MAC personnel.
Insurance
5.12      The Goverment and TOT have not in the past seen f_2t to purchase
insurance against major losses on TOT's fixed assets from .yphoons or other
catastrophes, because insurance rates for this type of coverage are con-
sidered uneconomically high. TOT's management feels that the wide
geographical spread of its assets provides reasonable dispersion of risk
of the more normal risks such as fire and theft, and thus does not carry
this type of insurance either.  This is a reasonable policy for TOT and
in line with the approach adopted by most telecommunications entities.



- 18 -
6. FINANCES
6.01      TOT's past earnings have been satisfactory.  The main feature
bearing on future financial operations is the greater use of debt financ-
ing to support the construction program. Borrowings would finance 54% of
total requirements (US$177 million equivalent) over the next five years,
compared with about 20% of US$82 million equivalent during the previous
five years, and the debt/equity ratio would rise from 24/76 to 48/52.
There are two reasons for this change in the financing pattern: (i) abolish-
ment in 1970 of a high connection fee which in the past provided funds for
expansion, and (ii) TOT's increased capital investment. TOT should never-
theless be able to carry out its expansion program under this new financing
pattern and still maintain a satisfactory financial position.
Tariffs
6.02      The tariff policy set forth in TOT's Act provides that income
shall be adequate to meet expenses, including maintenance and depreciation,
and provide surpluses for debt service and capital expansion; the amount
to be provided for investment is not defined.
6.03      Procedurally, changes in telecommunications tariffs are proposed
by TOT's Board of Directors and are subject to review by the Budget Bureau
and the National Economic Development Board (NEDB) and approval by the
Minister of Communications. A summary of present tariffs is in Annex 12.
Tariff charges for Government are discus 3ed in paragraph 6.09.
6.04      Rental and call charges have not changed since 1962. With the
current large expansion program, TOT has undertaken a tariff review which
considers (i) establishing a common rental for all services, since most
service is for business purposes even though it may be located in a resi-
dence; (ii) replacing the free call allowance with a lower, fixed charge
per call; and (iii) introducing a new scale of long-distance charges suit-
able for subscriber trunk dialing (STD). During negotiations agreement
was reached on a timetable for TOT submitting its tariff recommendations
to the Bank for agreement and subsequently to Government for approval and
on the recommendatiorsbeing implemented proimptly as needed to coordinate
with the introduction of STD.
6.o5      The present level of tariffs has permitted TOT sufficient revenue
to cover its operating costs, debt service, payments to Government (see
paragraph 6.10), which are analogous to an income tax, and about 40% of
its expansion costs. To ensure that TOT maintains satisfactory earnings,
agreement was reached during negotiations that the overall net effect of
changes in the present tariffs resulting from the review will not reduce
total revenues from the amount which would be produced under the existing
tariffs during the project period, and that thereafter tariffs will be
maintained at a level to produce revenues, after deducting payments to
Government, sufficient to earn a rate of return on average net fixed
assets in operation of no less than 10% (see paragraph 6.19).



- 19 -
Past Operations
6.06      Income statements for 1968-71 and related notes are shown in
Annex 13. TOT's operating results over the past four years have been
satisfactory. Operating ratios varied between 66% and 72%. Net operat-
ing income has been equal to returns on average net plant in service
ranging from 8.8% in 1968 to 11.4% in 1970.  Oparating ratios and net
operating income, as well as internal cash generation, throughout the
report are stated on a basis which includes as operating expense the
provisions for bonus payments (see paragraph 6.11) and payments to
Government equivalent to income taxes.
6.07      During the past four years TOT has financed about 67% of its
requirements from internal sources: 42% from net internal cash generation
after debt service; 7% from subscriber deposits; 18% from draw-down of
cash balances and from a large subscriber connection fee, which has since
been abolished on order of Government; and the remaining 33% from borrow-
ings (22%) and from Government taking up equity (11%).
Collections
6.08      While collections from private subscribers have been reasonably
satisfactory, Government collections have been slow. Government settles
its telephone accounts in two ways, depending upon the type of service
rendered. For other than rental and local call charges, TOT bills
Government according to the tariff, allowing a 15% discount on long dis-
tance on the basis of bulk usage, and Government pays these bills in full,
though with some delay. The amount of these receivables is high, compris-
ing about one-third of TOT's total receivables, which were equivalent to
90 days' billings at the end of fiscal year 1971.
6.09      Government pays erratically for rental and local call charges,
electing from year to year an arbitrary amount for full payment equivalent
to only about 60% of the concessional tariff currently applicable to
Government. Actual payments, however, have fallen short of even this amount
and B32.7 million (Us$1.6 million) of arrears has been written off over the
years as an operating expense, amounting to about 3% of the last four years'
total revenues. If Government had been billed according to the rate as
quoted in the tariff, an additional B45 million (US$2.2 million) would be
owed TOT. This problem will become more acute with the introduction of
STD, when long-distance charges will appear on the local bill. Agreement
was reached during negotiations that new tariffs, applicable to and payable
by the Government, will be introduced according to an agreed timetable.
The Government has further agreed to a timetable for settling its arrears
to TOT within four years.
Payments to Government
6.10      TOT makes annual payments to Government in accordance with a
Cabinet Resolution passed in 1965 that requires State enterprises to
return to Government an amount equal to the amount of taxes a private
concern pays under the Revenue Code, which was 25% of net income until
1971, when it was raised to 30%.

Bonuses
6.1i      In accordance with another Cabinet Resolution pertaining to
State enterprises, TOT pays an annual bonus to its staff and the members
of the Board. The staff's bonus is equal to 5% of net income and the
Board's bonus is equal to 2%, with the latter not to exceed B300,000
($14,423). TOT's management feels that the overall incentive provided
by this scheme is beneficial, giving most staff members a personal
interest in the entity's well-being. The bonus payments are treated
as an operating expense in the accounts.
Present Financial Position
6.12      Balance sheets for 19658-1971 are presented in Annex 14.  The
book value of assets is realistic, since there has been a high degree of
price stability in Thailand for many years; also a high proportion of the
assets has been recently built and reflects current costs. Between 1954
and 1962, assets valued at B50.5 million were transferred from the Posts
and Telegraphs Department.  In 1966 and 1970, Government transferred to
TOT microwave routes valued at B351.9 million, serving the country's
northern and southern regionls; the value of these transfers totals about
25% of the value of plant in service at the end of fiscal year 1971.
All other plant additions have been added under TOT's expansion programs.
6.13      Depreciation has been computed on a straight-line basis, based
on the life of the various categories of plant in service. Rates vary
from about 2% for buildings to 20% for vehicles, resulting in a composite
rate of about 5-1/2%; this is realistic. Forecasts assume the same
composite rate.

6.1L      TOT's capitalization as of September 30, 1971, is summarized
below:
US$ Million

Equity
Govemnment investment                     513.4       24.7       28.9

Retained earnings (less
deficit on debt revaluation) 1/         839.7      40.4        47.3
Total Eqaiity                 1, 357.7     65.3        76.4
Long-Term Debt
Long-term debt (less current
maturities)                             417.9       20.1       23.6
Total Capitalization          1,775.6      85.4       100.0
6.15      Two main factors contribute to TOT's conservative capital struc-
ture wherein debt equals 24% of capitalization as of September 30, 1971:
Government has provided substantial investment as equity; and TOT has been
able to invest a large part of its eanmings in plant expansion. Government
equity investment over the past three years increased by 43% and retained
earnings by 42%.
Financing Plan
6.16      The forecast of Sources and Applications of Funds for the period
1972-1978 (Annex 15) is based on TOT's total development program given in
Annex 3, assumed future works beyond the program, forecast earmings given
in Annex 13, borrowings given in Annex 14, and estimated increases in
working capital.  Shown below is a summary of the financing plan for the
five-year project period 1972-1976.
1/    Debt repayable in Japanese yen and Belgian francs at the close of
fiscal year 1971 was revalued upward by 20% and 15%, respectively,
or by a total of B58.3 million equivalent (equivalent to 15% of
long-term debt and 3% of total capitalization), and retained
earnings were correspondingly reduced. While another method of
accounting for the revaluation of debt would have been to increase
the value of plant in service, TOT has indicated that it would be
charging retained earnings. With the relatively small amount
involved, either method is acceptable.

6.17      Included as sources of funds are borrowings arranged by Government
of B310 million (US$14.9 million) and Government investment as equity of
B310 million. The borrowings would consist of Government loans and possibly
bonds issued by TOT in the open market. The latter would be a new source
of funds for TOT. EGAT successfully raised B50 million through a bond issue
recently, which was the first time that a State enterprise offered bonds for
public subscription. Government loans of B210 million are assumed at
1/    B195.9 million of the total 1972-1976 development program, including
the residual US$1.2 million Bank loan, is estimated to be spent in
1977 and is mainly retention payments.

8% interest, with terms of 12 years including two year grace periods;
bonds totaling B100 million are assumed to carry a 9% interest rate over
five years, similar to the EGAT bond issue. About 50% of the total funds
to be made available by Government. to TOT has been assumed to be equity
investments in order to enable the entity to maintain a strong capital
structure so that it will not find itself with too great a debt burden
in the future. TOT will be incurring other debt to the extent that its
debt/equity ratio is forecast to rise from 24/76 in fiscal year 1971 to
51/49 in 1978 -- a debt position which, although fairly conservative,
preferably should not be exceeded at this time to permit TOT to incur the
substantial debt required for expansion from 1978. It is assumed that TOT
will continue to pay 30% of its annual net income to Government equivalent
to normal corporate income tax, and would pay Government a dividend on its
investment beginning about two years after completion of the program.
During negotiations these financial arrangements with Government were
confirmed, including dividends not being paid before completion of the
1972-76 Development Program.
6.18      Details of the other borrowings are given in Annex 14,
paragraph 11. The Japan EUIM Bank loans totaling US$3.6 million have
already been arranged. The sources of bilateral loans/supplier credits
amounting to US$19.7 million are not presently known, but it is reason-
able to expect that, as in the past, they would be available at favorable
terms; about US$7 million is in the process of being firmed up. With
these borrowings the financing plan for Phase I would be assured. Never-
theless, assurances were obtained during negotiations that Goverment
would be prepared to cover any financing gap in the project. Future
borrowings of US$21.6 million equivalent are assuned to be available from
1975 from international financing agencies to help finance Phase II of
the 1972-76 Developnent Plan.
6.19      During the five-year period, 1972-76, net internal sources of
funds after providing for debt service would be equivalent to 37% of the
construction costs and worldng capital increase; Government's equity
investment would amount to 9% and borrowings 54%, of which 20% would be
the proposed Bank loan. The financing of 37% of total requirements from
internal sources is satisfactory, considering that TOT's value of plant
in service is expected to increase by B2.6 billion (US$125 million) --
an increase of 1 .7 times.
Future Finances
6.20      Forecast income statements and balance sheets for 1972-78 are
shown in Annexes 13 and 14. Existing tariffs, summarized in Annex 12,
are assumed for the forecasts. Based on the new facilities to be provided
by the expansion program, operating revenues over the next seven years are
estimated to increase at an average annual rate of 16%; operating expenses,
which are estimated to increase at 17%, provide for additional staff as
well as other expenses arising from the larger network. These increases
are of the same order as in the past. The rate of return is expected to



- 24 -
reach about 14% in 1972 and then decline to 10% during the seven-year
period. Considering that TOT pays 30% of net income to Government as the
equivalent of the income tax normally paid by a private concern, the
10% rate of return after this payment is very satisfactory; before deduct-
ing the payment to Government, the corresponding rates of return would range
from 19% to 12%. The higher rate of return in some years of this forecast
is due to excessive occupancy of plant dae to backlog of demand before new
works are commissioned. Operating ratios would be satisfactory at about
66%; this compares with past ratios of 66% to 72%.
6.21      The forecast financial position is satisfactory.  The ratio of
current assets to current liabilities would range between 2.5/1 and 1.9/1.
Coverage of interest and amortization by internal cash generation would
be satisfactory at between 4.7 and 2.1 times.
Debt Limitation Covenant
6.22      In the past, TOT has had relatively little debt but with the
proposed program a substantial amount of debt will be incurred, as is
also expected for future programs. With this new financing pattern, it
is essential that TOT in its long-term financial planning not over-
extend itself with borrowings. During negotiations agreement was reached
on a debt service coverage of at least 1.5 times, based on the Bank's
usual debt limitation covenant.

7. REOMEDATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations# agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a)  Government will undertake to consult with the Bank before any
changes affecting TOT's overa]4L organization or responsibilities
are made (paragraph 2.05);
(b)  The Bank's standard audit covenant will be adopted; and the
audited accounts will be sent to the Bank within four months
after the end of the fiscal year (paragraph 5.11);
(c)  A tariff review will be male and the Bank willI be consulted on
its terms of reference and on any changes recommended; total
revenues will not be lowered during the project period and
thereafter tariffCs will be sufficient to earn a ninimum rate
of return of 10% after deducting payments to tGovernment
equivalent to incoms taxes (paragraphs 6.O0  and 6,05);
(d)  Arrangements satisfactory to the Bank will be made for a
tariff which will be applicable to and payable by Government
and for Government to pay its current bills and settle its
arrears (paragraph 6.09);
(e)  Government will arrange financing as needed by TOT, totaling
about US$30 million equivalent, divided approximately equally
between equity and debt (paragraph 6.17);
(f)  Dividend payments will not be paid before completion of the
1972-76 Development Plan (paragraph 6.17);
(g) Government will cover any financing gap in the project
(paragraph 6.18);
(h)  There will be a limitation to the incurrence of long-term
debt (paragraph 6.22);
(i) Consultants will be employed to assist with project super-
vision and management studies, under terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank (paragraph 3015); and
(j)  A number of measures on technical matters. agreed with the
Bank, are being taken isee paragraphs 2.05, 2.15, 3.16,
4.o8 and 5.o6).



- 26 -
7.02     With the indicated assurances and confirmations, the project
is suitable for a Bank loan of US$37 million equivalent, for a term of
20 years including a four-year grace period.

1973 :1.5
1975 : 1.5
1976 : 1.4
1977 : 1.4
l/Increases in plant capacity beyond 1974 are due to the 1972-76 Development Plan.
Phase I targets (see paragraph 3.04) are achieved by approximately mid-1976.

Demand Fo recasting
Introduction
Total telephone demand consists of three parts, due to:
a) Connected subscribers;
b) Waiting subscribers as recorded on a waiting list;
c) Hidden demand, being potential subscribers who have not
expressed their needs by formally applying for service.
The demand for direct exchange lines was estimated for the Greater
Bangkok area and, separately and with a different methodology, for the
provinces.
iorecasts
In Bangkok no waiting list is kept, but the field survey methods
described below lead directly to estimates of total demand. The demand was
estimated for 1970, 1980 and 1990.
The total demand for 1970 was estimated by using detailed maps.
For squares of 250 x 250 m, the existing total demand was estimated in field
surveys that consisted of assessing the present overall telephone potential
of each building by external inspection (based on location, size, type,
condition, etc.), except for some cases where special investigation was
considered necessary, e.g., in official and large commercial buildings,
shopping centers, hospitals, universities, large industries, etc. In these
cases the surveyors filled out a questionnaire, using a guideline indicating
the present number of lines to be considered for each kind of building or
establishment; while the basis for this was of necessity arbitrary, the
numbers assumed were reasonable although they may imply a telephone penetra-
tion that would, in practice, take several years to develop fully. However,
this would not influence the 1976/77 demand forecasts, of which in any case
the project will satisfy only about 65%.
Although nominally residential subscribers represent about 55%
of total connections in 1976, the mission agrees with TOT that most telephones
are in reality placed in small shops (the mission substantiated this by a
sample survey). Still other residential phones are used for professional
and productive activities (M.D.'s, accountants, managers of enterprises, etc.).
Forecasts for 1980 and 1990 were made by using a somewhat different
approach, on the basis of information in municipal master plans showing
expected building development for the Greater Bangkok area. A number of
telephone lines per 250 x 250 m square was assumed, depending on the kind of



ANNEX 7
Page 2 of 5 pages
buildings in the area. The nwmber of lines assumed for each kind of building
was kept constant for both estimates (1980 and 1990), implying no increase
in penetration between 1980 and 1990. Thus the whole picture should be con-
sidered one of over-estimation of initial demand (1970) and under-estimation
of the growth rate of demand. The total demand for the Greater Bangkok area
(including Thonburi) was estimated at 250,324 in 1970 and 468,473 in 1980,
giving an annual growth rate of 6.5% on the average. (Demand forecast for
1990 is 835,992, implying a 6% annual growth rate between 1980 and 1990.)
This is a very conservative figure, especially when connections have grown
between 1963 and 1971 at a rate of 17% per year on the average.
Exponential interpolation gives the following figures (as compared
with connections) for 1971 and 1976:
Total        Lines              % Demand
Year           Demand        Connected          Satisfied
1971           266,595        105,550               40
1976           365,258        238,000               65
(Historical and planned development of connections is given in Table 1,
attached.)
The fact that it is planned to satisfy only 65% of forecast demand
in 1976 makes a possible over-estimation in the overall demand a less crucial
issue. Even if demand were over-estimated for 1970, as it may possibly be,
the assumed growth rate is probably too low. If initial demand would be one-
third less than the suggested figure, a 10% annual rate of growth would
suffice to ensure that by 1976 demand would be 20% above the number of
connected subscribers; i.e., 80% of demand would be satisfied.
Although the global forecast for Greater Bangkok shows that planned
connections will remain below demand, some caution should be exercised in
estimating the geographical location of future subscribers, so as to inatall
distribution cables according to realistic priorities. The reopening of
waiting lists (by future exchange areas) was accordingly recommended, and
during negotiations it was confirmed that this is being done.
Provincial Forecasts
For the provinces, the method used to determine the requirements
was to add the present waiting list (14,787 as of September 1971) to the
existing subscribers to obtain the present explicit demand. (Regional data
are included in Tables 2 and 3, attached.) The program calls for a total
exchange capacity of 106,300 lines, with 62,743 lines connected by the end
of the Development Plan (1976). The present explicit demand (1971) is
45,985. A very moderate growth of demand, 10% per year, would imply a total
explicit (connected plus waiting lists only) demand of 74,060 in 1976. The
Plan would then call for 85% satisfaction of this demand, as compared with
68% today. If an annual growth of demand of 15% is assumed as an upper
limit, the total explicit demand in 1976 would be 92,476. Connected sub-
scribers would then be 68% of the total explicit demand.

TELEPHONE ORGANIZATION OF THAILAND
Rate of Return
Project Period
1.        In calculating the financial rate of return, a study period has
been taken corresponding to the mean life of the various items of plant
making up the project, which is assumed to have a lifetime of 20 years,
commencing in 1974.
Costs
2.        The estimated project costs include contingencies but exclude
import duties and taxes on TOT's imports. The average rate of import
duties is 30% and taxes are paid at the rate of 11%.
3.        The life of telecommunications equipment varies.  Some equipment
will have longer lives than the project period of 20 years, while others
will be shorter and will need replacing in the project period.  Therefore,
a residual value as well as additional values have been estimated and
included in the construction cost stream, based on the following assumed
average lives of plant items:
Buildings                       40 years
Cable                           30 years
Exchanges                       25 years
Transmission equipment          12 years
Telephone sets                  10 years
Vehicles                         5 years
4.        Operating costs were estimated from the income statements by
assuming that operating expenses, excluding depreciation, per exchange
line added under the project are attributable to the project.
Revenues
5.        Estimates of subscriber deposits are based on the assumption that
the exchange fill will go up to 92% if the project is not undertaken.
6.        Local service revenuen wore optimatd frm the fti#nb@r bi sub-
scribers connected due to the pro3Jct, tkiftf   ito goouit the ft@Raist
ratio of residential subacribers to business subscribers.  It is assumed
that the exchange fill relating to the lines installed under the project
would reach 92%.

7.        In forecastiig toll revenue, the following assumptions were
made:
(i)  the existing toll plant would be saturated by 1974;
(ii) toll traffic would grow at 10% per year as a result of the
toll facilities provided in the project;
(iii)  in the years 1977 and 1978 there is another 10% growth
per annum because of STD stimulus;
(iv) the new facilities would reach capacity in 1984.
8.        Other revenue attributable to the project is assumed at B2 million
annually from 1975 to 1993.

Rate of Return
9.        The financial rate of return is at least 14%, based on this study
which equates the present worth of the projectts construction costs (exclud-
ing import duties and taxes on TOT's imports) and operating costs (excluding
depreciation) to the present worth of the attributable revenues, including
subscriber deposits.
Sensitivity Analysis
10.       A sensitivity analysis was carried out giving the following
results:
Rate of Return
10% increase in construction costs                      13.6%
10% increase in operating costs                         13.6%
10% increase in operating revenues                      15.9%
10% increase in construction costs with 10%
increase in operating costs and a 10% decrease
in revenue growth from the projectts facilities   10.9%

TELEPHONE ORGANIZATION OF THAILAND
"Epilogue"f
(Verbatim Ertract from TOTts Annual Report 1970)
It seems appropriate to reiterate that the basic policy as
set forth in TOT Act has always been the polestar of the Organization.
TOT realizes that its job is to provide the best possible communications
service and make it continuously better and more abundant. It has to
be admitted however that this is by no means a bed of roses to accomplish
the task particularly in a country with ever-changing social and indus-
trial needs. Besides, TOT being governmental enterprise, has to abide
by all state laws, rules and regulations presenting, needless to say,
traditional incorrigible red tapes. Project proposed by TOT must go
through machinery for approval in terms of order, namely Ministry of
Communications, National Economics Development Board, Budget Bureau and
Ministerial Council at last. Telephone service is public utility the
administration of which should be run and operated in a manner to expedi-
tiously satisfy pressing public needs and demands. This, TOT fully
realizes. It has always done all it can and as soon as possible within
its jurisdiction, entrusted power and delegated authority in order to get
the ball rolling. Experience shoms that a number of times things get to
the state of impasse and are beyond TOT's domain. Thus, in an awkward
predicament is TOT. This is not the place and time for TOT to grieve or
grumble but it is strongly felt that public and potential subscribers
should know.

ANNEX 13
Page 2 of 3 pages
TELEPHONE ORGANIZATION OF THAILAND
Notes and Assumptions on Income Statements
Operating Revenue
1.         Operating revenues include (i) local revenue (telephone rental,
call charges, installation fees, public telephone revenue and rental of
auxiliary equipment); (ii) toll revenue (domestic and international); and
(iii) other revenue (such as yellow page advertizing, charges for extra
maintenance and sale of scrap). Forecast revenues are calculated based
on planned average increase in telephone connections and traffic forecasts.
The annual rate of increase in total operating revenue is as follows:
1972     1973     1974      1975     1976      1977     1978
28%      16%      11%       10%      14%       18%      17%
Operating Expense
2.         Forecast staff remuneration, maintenance expense, and other
operating and administrative expense are estimated based on the number
of staff that will be required, including better qualified staff, growth
of the system, and taking into account past experience. The composite
rate of depreciation during the past four years has amounted to about 5-1/2%
on average gross plant in service, less retirements, at the end of the year.
A rate of 5-1/2% on the same basis is used for the forecast.
3.         Included as operating expense (Other Operating Expense) is the
loss that TOT expects to incur in connection with retirement of plant
(see para. 4.10 and Annex 15, note 1).
4.         The annual rate of increase in total operating expense, excluding
depreciation but including bonus payments, is as follows:
1972     1973     1974      1975     1976      1977     1978
27%      24%      11%        5%      13%       12%      13%
Other Income
5.         Other income in the past has been almost wholly interest earned
on TOT's deposits of excess cash. Since TOT is not expected to have excess
cash beginning with 1973, other income is shown to be nil.
Bonus Payments
6.         Bonus payments (see para. 6.11) are calculated on net income and
are considered as part of remuneration paid the staff and Board of DLrectors
and therefore are treated as an operating expense.



ANNEX 13
Page 3 of 3 pages
Payment to Government
7.         The payment to Government equivalent to income taxes (see
para. 6.10) is assumed to continue at the present 30% of net income.
Dividend on Equity
8.         It is assumed that, beginning in 1978, twvo years after the
present five-year program, TOT will begin paying Government a dividend
on its investment.

ANNEX 14
Page 2 of 5 pages
TELEPHONE ORGANIZATION OF THAILAND
Notes and Assumptions on Balance Sheets
Plant in Service and Depreciation
1.        Estimated plant in service, 1972-78, is based on the annual
investment program detailed in Annex 3. The basis for charging depre-
ciation is stated in para. 6.13. Assets were transferred to TOT from
the Pbsts and Telegraphs Department between 1954 and 1962 valued at
B50.5 million and from the Government in 1966 and 1970 valued at B351.9
million, a total value equivalent to US$19.3 million. Plant retirements
are deducted from the plant account and the depreciation reserve. Salvage
from retirement is either sold or taken to stores. Plant recovered and
reinstalled is recorded in the books at its estimated depreciated value.
In a case of any premature retirement of plant, the plant account will
be reduced only to the extent of the estimated expired life of the assets,
as will the depreciation reserve account, and any net loss sustained will
be reflected as an operating expense.
Plant Under Construction
2.        In the forecasts it is assumed that the amount of plant under
construction each year will be 50% of the sum of plant under construction
the previous year plus the construction program of the current year. This
was discussed and agreed with officials of the engineering and finance
departments.
Cash
3.        Forecast cash balances are derived from the Sources and Applica-
tions of Funds statement and beginning in 1973 amount to about two months'
cash operating expense.
Subscriber Accounts Receivable
4.        It is assumed that the annual amount of forecast subscriber
accounts receivables will continue at the present 24% of total annual
operating revenues through the five year program before beginning to improve.
Inventories
5.        Forecasts assume inventories to amount to about B325 per
installed telephone, which is based on past experience.



ANNEX 14
1-ag22 of 5pages
Other Current Assets
6.        Other current assets are mainly prepaid expense and prepayment
for materials and supplies used in maintenance. These are forecast on
the basis of past experience, taking into account the new constracticn
programn.
Other Assets
7.        Other assets include an earlier investment of B3 million in
a firm that sold telephone equipment in Thailand. This agreement expired
a few years ago but the Government Audit Council has not yet issued
instructions on the disposition of the account.
Government Investment
8.        Government investment consists of funds made available to TOT,
assets transferred from both the Posts and Telegraphs Department and Govern-
ment (see para. 1 of this annex), and in future from Government taking up
equity in TOT (see para. 6.17).
Subscriber Contributions
9.        This represents a small amount of equipment pvrchased by subscribers
which became the property of TOT.
Retained Earnings
10.       Retained earnings each year consists of the sum of retained earnings
at the end of the previous year and net income transferred to retained earnings
in the current year. Retained earnings in 1971 was charged with the revalua-
tion of debt (see para. 6.14).
Long-Term Debt
11.       Forecast long-term debt is as follows:
Loans Obtained
(i) Undisbursed balance of about US$1 million equivalent (assuming a
rate of exchange of Y300/US$1) of a Japan FXM Bank loan totaling
Y4.5 billion yen (US$15 million) at an interest rate of 5-3/4%
and a term of 18 years, including a 5-year grace period.
(ii) Japan EXIM Bank loan of Y792 million (US$2.6 million assuming a
rate of exchange of Y300/US$l) at an interest rate of 5-3/4% and
a term of 18 years, including a 5-year grace period.



ANNEX 14
Page 4 of 5 pages
Loans Proposed
(i) Proposed IBRD loan of US$37 million equivalent, which has
been assumed at an interest rate of 7V and a term of 20
years, including a 4-year grace period.
(ii) Government loans totaling B210 million (Us$10.1 million
equivalent), assumed at interest rates of 8% and terms of
12 years, including 2-year grace periods (see para. 6.17).
(iii)  TOT bonds totaling B100 million (US$4.8 million), issued
in the open market, assumed to carry a 9% interest rate
over five years.
(iv)  Supplier credits/bilateral loans totaling US$19.7 million
equivalent, amounting to 11% of total requirements for the
1972-76 period, are assumed at an interest rate of 7% and
a term of 13 years, including a 3-year grace period.
Although the source of these loans is not presently known,
it is reasonable to expect that they would be available as
in the past and at favorable terms. About US$7 million
equivalent is now in the process of being firmed up in
connection with a recent bid for exchange equipment, for
which the debt terms are expected to be equal or better than
for the last Japan EXIK Bank loans (see (i) and (ii) of
para. 11 above).
(v)  Assumed future borrowings of US$21.6 million equivalent on
terms similar to those of the proposed Bank loan to help
finance Phase II of the 1972-76 Development Plan.
12.       The 1971 audited figures of the Audit Council do not reflect
the revaluation of debt in Japanese yen and Belgian francs, whereas the
figures in the appraisal report do. It is understood that the Audit
Council will be amending its 1971 audited figures to include this
adjustment.
Current Liabilities
13.       Current liabilities include accounts payable, accrued expenses,
the 30% paymaen' to Government for the current year (payable the following
year), and current maturities. Forecasts assume accounts payable to
increase by 8%; accrued expenses are forecast to increase based on the
past history of the individual items.
Deferred Credit
14.       In order to augment funds for capital expansion, TOT instituted
a scheme where a new subscriber was charged B15,000: B500 for the cost of
connection, B1,500 set deposit, and B13,000 as prepaid telephone rental,
which is amortized over 20 years in the case of a residential subscriber
and 5 years for a business subscriber. This scheme was in effect only a
few years when Government abolished it. Forecasts after 1973 show annual
amortization at B5 million.

Subscriber Deposit
15.       This is a non interest bearing deposit made by each new subscriber
and is refundable upon disconnection of service. These deposits are the sum
of subscriber deposits outstanding at the end of the previous year and
deposits collected during the current year from new subscribers.
Other Liabilities
16.       Other liabilities include performance bonds, PBX contract payments
and bidding deposits. Forecasts assume an annual increase of about 15%.

TELEPHONE ORGANIZATION OF THAILAND
Notes and Assumptions on Sources and Applications of Funds
1.         Figures for Net Income Available for Fixed Charges and Depreciation
are taken from the Income Statement (Page 1 of Annex 13).  "Other" is derived
from the estimated loss oIn plant retirement, which is reflected as non cash
operating expense.
2.         Borrowings are as shown in the Balance Sheet and are summarized in
the notes to the Balance Sheet.
3.         Government Investment is explained in para. 6.17 of the appraisal
report.
41.        Subscriber Deposits are based on the number of new subscriber
lines estimated to be installed each year. Metropolitan area carries a
B1,500 deposit, and the provinces a B4OO deposit.
5.         The Construction Program is defined in para. 3.02 of the appraisal
report.
6.         Debt Service - interest and amortization - is calculated based
on the actual lending terms of those borrowings already arranged and current
terms generally in effect for those borrowings assumed.
7.         A dividend of B30 million on Government investment is assumed
to be paid in 1978.
