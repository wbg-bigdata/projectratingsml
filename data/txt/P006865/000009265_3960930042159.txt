_  s t        For the Project's private sector credit program component, BR
would relend US$ 192 million of the proceeds of the loan in local
currency to participating financial intermediaries (PFIs) and
charge at least the fully variable average deposit rate of the
Colombian banking system (DTIF) plus a margin to cover
administrative costs and foreign exchange risk if denominated in
Pesos or, if denominated in US$ equivalent, a rate reflecting at
least the Bank's interest rate plus a fee to cover the cross-
currency risk and BR's administrative costs. Relending rates to
enterprises would be determined by the PFI1 according to the
maturity, credit risk, operational cost and competition of each
investment loan up to a maximum of six percentage points above
BR's rate to the PFI. The ceiling on the spread has been set to
equal or exceed the current average free market spreads. For Peso
loans, BR would bear explicitly the full foreign exchange risk,
and would bear only the cross-currency risk for USS equivalent
loans. For the public sector support component, US$ 8 million of
the loan proceeds would be made available by BR to the Government
on terms identical to BR's repayment obligations to the Bank.

MEMORAND   AND UCCMMATION 0F TUE MIDEIT
OF TIE NOAL I     01 =RCONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPAET
TO THE EXECUTIE DIRICTORS
ON A PROPOOSD LOAN TO COLOMBIA
M11    I STRAL RISTCTRING ANDEVElOPNT PROJECT
1        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Colombia for US$200 millton is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would
be on standard terms, including 17 years maturity and 5 year. grace.
2.        B&SkLrgSU4. The structure of Colombia's industrial production which
is almost entirely in the private sector, has remained relatively static since
the mid-1970s and of modest importance to the economy, contrasting sharply with
the dramatic changes that have taken place in many newly industrialized countries
(NICs).  Production facilities have a preponderance of older equipment and
industrial output has been concentrated increasingly in a limited number of
plants. Output has been focused consistently on the domestic market and bas
failed to generate a level of exports wbich would reduce Colombia's heavy
dependence on commodity exports. The competitive position in international
markets of a number of important ColombianAindustries (agroindustry, textile. and
clothing, leather and shoes, steel, vehicle assembly and parts) is quite weak.
Average product costs are in most cases above their NIC comparators, while factor
productivity is generally low. Product designs suffer basically from inadequate
communication with external markets and local institutional support. Product
quality is hampered by defective raw materials and the aging technology
frequently in use.  Market response time is uniformly high, partly   a a
consequence of organizational problems of producers.
3.        Basic comparative advantages of Colombia, such as low unit labor
costs, abundant raw materials and good geographical position, are offset further
by a pletiort  of public policy and institutional factors. These have included
high duties and surcharges on imported capital goods and technology, scarce long-
term credit and high real Interest rates, regulatory constraints on the nobility
)f- labor, administrative barriers to the acquisition of technology, duty
dr*vbacks and directed credit, and a time-consuming and costly transportation
network.
4.        The recently elected Colombian Government is implementing vigorously
an Economic Modernization Program (SUP) set in motion early in 1990 to liberalize
the external trade reginm, accelerate the reform of public services and devolop
an internationally competitive private sector. The program marks the recognitian
by many policy makers and private entrepreneurs that Colombia's socio-economic
objectives for the 1990s---to accelerate the country's rate of economic growth
and employment creation, lower prices to consumers, and further diversify the
nation9' export structure---cannot be met by continued high trade protection,
import substitution, and capital-driven growth.
5.        Rationle  for Bank Involvement.   Preparation of the Industrial
Restructuring and Development Project (IRDP) has facilitated the definition of
policy issues and the competitive strengths and weaknesses of local industry.
It has mobilized interest in the restructuring process and helped to build a
dialogue between private industrialists and the public sector on how to achieve
international competitiveness. Bank support of the Project has also helped to
bring about the public policy and institutional changes required by enterprises



2
to compete and to mobilize the resources and oervices needed by them to implement
the restructuring process.
6.        The Project is part of a package of Bank-supported policy and
institutional adjustments to facilitate the realization of the ENW. A Bank loan
of US$80 million equivalent was approved in 1989 for a Fifth Small and Medium
Scale Enterprise (SHE) Project, and a loan of US$300 million has recently been
approved to support broad-based public sector regulatory and enterprise reforms.
Two additional projects are under preparation which aim inter alia to facilitate
the reorganization of Colombia's industrial development bank for large scale
enterprises, the Instituto de Fomento Industrial (IFI), and to accelerate export
development.   The  experience  gained  in  past  lending through  financil
intermediaries to Colombian industry has demonstrated in particular the
importance of addressing directly policy and institutional constraints to
international competitiveness.   Therefore, the proposed Project embodies
substantial adjustments mainly in the trade, financial sector and labor regimae.
7.        Pro1ect Objectives and Descrintion.  The Government seeks the Bank's
support through the proposed Project in order to facilitate a supply response to
the trade reform. The Project would provide capital and other support to assist
the private sector in renovating existing industrial production capacity so as
to reduce product costs, increasing product quality and services, building new
capacity for goods in which Colombia has a dynamic comparative advantage, or
phasing out capacity which is unlikely to produce acceptable long run returns tn
an internationally competitive business environment. The Project incorporates
those public policy and regulatory adjustments in the areas of external trade,
domestic competition, the financial sector, labor and technology needed to
achieve IRDP objectives. Most of these adjustments have already been achieved
during Project processing. The Project, with an estimated total cost of US$500
million equivalent, would also include:  (a) a private sector credit program to
finance investments and technical assistance to industrial enterprises and
supporting services (US$492 million)I and (b) programs to facilitate labor
adjustment, environmental pollution control, and Project implementation
monitoring (US$8 million).
8.        The credit program would support investments by enterprises qualifying
as (a) manufacturing and mining sector businesses, Jand (b) services to help
prepare and implement investments by such sector businesses, Including those
oriented to the subsector level (eg., product design, technology and export
promotion centers). Eligible expenditures to be financed by the loan would be
broadly defined to include goods and services associated with the acquisition of
traditional fixed assets, working capital, and a broad range of other incremental
expenditures commonly required in restructuring exercises, such as product
research and development, development of new marketing and distributing networks,
and employee retraining and relocation.
9.        Oversight of' Project implementation would be exercised by the Ministry
of Econumic Development, (NED) while management of the Project's financial
resources would be performed by BR as "second-tier" institution. All development
and commercial banks in Colombia could, in principlg, become participating
financial intermediaries (PPIs). Qualifications as a PFI would depend upon (a)
certification that they observe the financial and operating requirements of the



3
Superintendency of Banks, which are satisfactory to the Bank for the proposed
Project, and (b) the ezistence of a valid participation agreement. BR would
review semi-annually a PI'e organization, stafflng, credit portfolio
performance, loan appraisal and supervision procedures for lending and equity
contributions under the Project, thereafter maintaining or adjusting accordingly
free limits applicable to subloans.
10.       BR would denominate the proceeds of the Bank's loan for the credit
program in Pesos or US$ equivalent, according to the preferences of the
enterprise. If denominated In Pesos, SR would rediscount 701 of a subloan or
equity investment made available by a M11 to finance an enterprise investment and
charge an interest rate, to the m   equivalent to at least DTF plus a margin to
cover administrative cost and foreign exchange risk.  If the proceeds are
denominated in US$ quivalent, BR would rediscount  OO1 of the US$  senomated
subloans up to a maximum of 50 of total subproject cost and charge a rate
reflecting the Bank's interest rate plus a fee to cover the cross-currency risks
and BR's administrative costs.  BR would bear explicitly the full foreign
exchange rate risk on Peso-denominated financing and only the cross-currency risk
on a US$ denominated loan. Maturities of funds relent to PMs wuld match those
set for beneficiaries. PuIs would set interest rates to clients according to the
investment  characteristics,  maturity,  credit  risk,  processing  cost  and
competition for each enterprise loan up to a maximm rate of six percentage
points above the rate from BR to the PFI. This ceiling on the spread has been
set to equal or exceed the current average free market spreads. Loan maturities
and grace periods would be set by the P1I according to the cash flow and other
characteristics of the Investment. PMs would mobilize the remaining 301 from
their own sources on tems identical to the rediscounted portion. Enterprise
loan approvals would normally require at least a 122 financial rate of return in
real terms supported by a sensitivity analysis. Given that the current trade
reform program should substantially reduce the distortions in the  econey, an
economic rate of return would not be required. BR would undertake with Bank
support a regular specific supervision program of the Project portfolio of each
P11.
11.      A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
The loan allocation and the Misbursement schedule are shown In Schedule S. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Colombia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map has
been included, and the Staff Appraisal leport No. 8633-CO, dated March 20, 1991
is attached.
129       Ayreed Actions    The main actions agreed upon under the Project are
as followas  (a) Trade PoUcy:  under the Government' trade reform program
initiated in February 1990, quantitative restrictions on imports have been
eliminated (excluding those associated with health and safety and national
security). It has further announced publicly final targets for the reform: by
end-1993 the maximum tariff level will not exceed 231# the average import-
weighted tariff will not exceed 161 and the number of tariff categories will be
reduced to no more that four (the current maximum is 501 for all products
excluding vehicles and the weighted average tariff lIs .11). Ongoing commitment
of the Bank's loan under the IRDP credit program would be conditiatupom-i4 =
maintenance of these three final targetst and (ii) coverage of industrial



4
domestic production by quantitative restrictions not exceeding 51 of value
(excluding health and safety and national security related permits). This second
condition would not apply If, in the opinion of the Bank, any such incarese above
the 5S lImit Is required exclusively as a temporary measw to prevent a fall In
the Government's ainternational reserves causei by an extreme and unexpected
disequilibrium in its balance of payments, and, further, that the Government
prepares within 120 days of the QR imposition, an action plan satisfactory to the
Bank for the substantial elimination of the QRo exempted from the limitation and
puts it into effect within 180 days of the imposition. Amendments needed to
simplify and accelerate proceosing of the duty drawback scheme have already been
made.  (b) Domestic Competitions  prior agreement with the Bank co  a price
stabilization mechanism for domestic cotton production purchased for the textiles
and clothing industries and on a deregulation program for the vehicle assembly
industry would be conditions of first disbursement -to enterprisos in the
respective subsectors. (c) Finanscal Sector: (i) interest rate subsidies on
industrial directed credit from BR to PFIs have been eliminated by setting the
minimum rates between these entities at the DTF and setting maximum rates to
users to-equal or exceed the current average free market spreads (6 percentage
points above the rate from BR to PPle; and (iU) industrial directed credit
regulations have been harmonised with the Bank loan by raising free limits and
shifting the focus of second-tier management to ex post monitoring of m
performanc  and auditing of the use of fundsj- (d) Lahor- Congress-has approved
legislation modifying the Labor Co4e to inter al& permit incresaed mobility of
labor as required by the restructuring process, specifically aimed to:  (i)
introduce competitiveness as grounds for transfer and dismissal of employees, the
adoption of new technology, and reduction of plant capacity, (ii) increase
flexibility in labor contracts, and (iii) reduce the time needed for public
sector approval when required; (e) Technology: agreed measures bave been taken
to effectively elimminate the selection criteria for technology contracts and
convert contract review procedures into a registration and verification of
contract data by the Superintendency of Industry; (f) Public Sector Support
Progras: a Pollution Control Program in the National Planning Department (DIP),
a Project Monitoring Program in HED, and a Labor Adjustment Assistance Program
Agreement (LAAP) have bean established. The detailed design of the LAAP would
be a condition of first loan disbursement for this component.
13.       Benefits and Risks. The Project is expected to help Colombia to shift
its industrial production capacity to areas of comparative advantage in the
international marketpla¢e.   It should. lead to significant increases  In
productivity, sustainable growth, and export market orientation of a number of
industries, as well as to. Improved environmental control. The main risks to
Project implementation are the occurrence of reversals in the Government's trade
reform program, that PFis are reluctant to lend for restructuring investments
because of their greater credit. risks, and that investments are Inadequately
prepared. To mitigate these risks, (a) the trade program has been publicly
announced, is well underway and the commitment of the Bank's loan is tied to the
maintenance of the progress made in its implementation; (b) the Project provides
that interest rates and terms on loans to enterprises can be set by Ms to
reflect perceived credit risk up to levels which would equal or exceed current
--   ave*age free -market -spreads-,- tc) substantal  pretnvestment vorkb-has been dton
during Project preparation which many enterprises are using to formulate



S
tveostmnts, and (d) the Project includes a variety of supporting measures and
resources to encourage sound design of investments.
14.      RecomendaIM.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would eomply
with the IBRD's Articles of Agreement and recammand that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
