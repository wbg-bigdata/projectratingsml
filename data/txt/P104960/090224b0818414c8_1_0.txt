                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The development objectives of the proposed project are to strengthen the operational, financial, and environmental performance of MSWM in Amman. Specifically, the
                         project will help achieve the following:
                         (i)       Environmentally upgrade and expand the existing municipal solid waste landfill to meet the city➢? s disposal needs up to 2013 and generate electricity while
                         mitigating GHGs; and
                         (ii)     Improve the cost effectiveness of the existing municipal solid waste collection and transport system and improve overall cost recovery.

                         A year after mid-term, overall progress on project implementation, particularly for the infrastructure component, is still very modest. Despite signature of the Landfill Gas Design Build
                         Operate (LFG DBO) contract in January 2012, which represents over 60% of the loan amount, implementation of the corresponding works have not started due to a disagreement
                         with the contractor/operator on site conditions. Management of the Greater Amman Municipality is in discussion with the operator to resolve this issue and initiate LFG works as soon
                         as possible. Due to this situation , and despite normal progress on the institutional component, the disbursement rate of the loan has increased only from 16% to 20% over the year.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Depending on the outcome of the discussion with the LFG Operator, GAM will need to revise its proposed request for a project restructuring. The initial proposal to include
                         construction of Cell 4, and upgrade of two existing transfer stations, in lieu of the two new transfer stations initially envisaged, will need to be amended to also take into account the
                         impacts on available funding and completion date of the outcome of the discussions with the LFG operator. A Bank mission will visit Amman in January 2013 to discuss these options
                         with GAM. In any case it appears now impossible to reach the objectives of the Project by the current closing date.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
