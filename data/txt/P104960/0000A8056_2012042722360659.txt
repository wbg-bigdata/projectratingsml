                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The development objectives of the proposed project are to strengthen the operational, financial, and environmental performance of MSWM in Amman. Specifically, the
                         project will help achieve the following:
                         (i)       Environmentally upgrade and expand the existing municipal solid waste landfill to meet the city➢? s disposal needs up to 2013 and generate electricity while
                         mitigating GHGs; and
                         (ii)     Improve the cost effectiveness of the existing municipal solid waste collection and transport system and improve overall cost recovery.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         At mid-term, overall progress on project implementation, particularly the infrastructure component, is still very modest given the protracted delay in signing the Landfill Gas Design
                         Build Operate (LFG DBO) contract and the lack of decision regarding the selection of the two transfer stations. The Institutional Component however is more advanced, particularly
                         the technical assistance for the operation of the El-Ghabawi landfill, the Strategic Planning study and the Public Information and Communication study. The disbursement rate of the
                         loan has been stagnant at 16% but the commitment rate should drastically increase from 18% to about 80% as the LFG DBO was signed during the week of January 15, 2012.

                         Despite delays in implementing some of the components (in particular the LFG DBO), the Mid Term review concluded that the PDOs should still be essentially completed within the
                         original time-frame of the project. Thus the overall development objective of the project remains unchanged.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Bank team concurs with GAM's request to include Cell 4 in the project. However, per the request of the Government, final decision regarding the transfer stations has been
                         deferred and will be further discussed as part of possible project restructuring during the next supervision mission, which is tentatively scheduled for June 2012.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
