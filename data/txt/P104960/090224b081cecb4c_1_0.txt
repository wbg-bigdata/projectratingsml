                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The development objectives of the proposed project are to strengthen the operational, financial, and environmental performance of MSWM in Amman. Specifically, the
                         project will help achieve the following:
                         (i)       Environmentally upgrade and expand the existing municipal solid waste landfill to meet the city➢? s disposal needs up to 2013 and generate electricity while
                         mitigating GHGs; and
                         (ii)     Improve the cost effectiveness of the existing municipal solid waste collection and transport system and improve overall cost recovery.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Project progress is currently unsatisfactory. Disbursements have stagnated at the low level already attained in Fall 2012. The main reason is as follows.

                         Two thirds of loan funds are allocated to a single $25m landfill gas (LFG) collection and renewable energy production contract. This contract was signed in March 2012 with two years
                         delay over the initial plan. However despite its signature almost a year and a half ago, construction is yet to start. In view of this delay, but on the basis that site works would soon

                         begin, during the last supervision mission GAM and the team had prepared a level-1 restructuring (further detailed and justified in the last mission aide-memoire) which included:

                         •        reorienting the PDO, in particular to underline the important contribution of the project to renewable energy production in Jordan (with an economic rate of return of 25%),
                         and to remove cost recovery objectives which GAM keeps pursuing but will not be attributable to project activities,
                         •        adding a direly needed 4th cell at the EL Ghabawi landfill (this would not affect safeguards),
                         •        the removal of new transfer stations from the project, which will be implemented outside of the project at a later date, while existing transfer stations are being improved, and
                         •        an extension of the closing date by one year to cope with delayed LFG contract implementation.
                         MOPIC had agreed upon the principle of the restructuring during the June 2012 CPPR.

                         However, the continuing disagreement between the LFG DBO contractor and GAM over the conditions required to start works now puts the relevance of such a restructuring into
                         question.
