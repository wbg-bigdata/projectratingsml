I. ENERGY SECTOR l/
Introduction
1.01      Energy prospects in Egypt have improved significantly over the last
decade. With the commissioning of the Aswan High Dam, Egypt harnessed most of
its hydroelectric potential. Successive increases in oil production have made
Egypt, in turn, self-sufficient and an exporter of oil. Currently, Egypt
views oil as a major source of foreign exchange earnings during the eighties.
Gas finds have further strengthened the energy base and increased the export
possibilities of oil. In 1978, petroleum provided 90% of Egypt's commercial
energy and its exports accounted for 50% of foreign trade receipts. Current
economic and industrial plans assume the continued availability of this
resource.
1.02      Whereas Egypt is currently a net exporter of energy, it is not
endowed with a particularly plenteous energy base. Hydropower, which in Egypt
is synonymous with the River Nile, has been harnessed to the extent of 80%.
Coal deposits in marginal quantities exist, but are not presently considered
economic to mine. Solar energy, although available in abundance, must await
a series of technological breakthroughs before it can be considered for
extensive application. Hydrocarbons appear to be the only primary source
which can sustain Egypt's incremental demand for energy. While Egypt can view
the current level of oil production with satisfaction, its known endowment in
oil is not high, at only about 0.4% of the world's resources. Its major oil
fields are likely to peak in the early eighties. With burgeoning demand for
hydrocarbons on the one hand and the prospects of reduced productivity from
existing oil fields on the other, Egypt would need to redouble its exploratory
efforts if it is to maintain its present status as exporter of energy over the
next decade. It would, in addition, have to develop and increase its natural
gas resources; to the extent that natural gas is used internally, it would
release liquid hydrocarbons for export.
Energy Balance
1.03      The main sources of primary commercial energy in Egypt are hydro-
power and petroleum. Coal deposits have been discovered in the Western
Desert and the Sinai Peninsula and are estimated at around 100 million tons.
A feasibility study for a coal-fired power plant in Sinai is presenting under
preparation. As in other developing economies non-commercial fuels in the
form of crop residue and animal waste, are used extensively, but no data is
available on its magnitude. A recent study estimates energy produced by
non-commercial fuels at around 5 million tons of oil equivalent, which is
about one-third of the total commercial energy used. On the basis of energy
consumption, production of oil and generation of hydropower, the table below
estimates Egypt's energy balance (commercial) in oil equivalent for 1978.
1/   The review in this section is an updated summary of the Energy Sector
contained in the Staff Appraisal Report of May 30, 1979, which may be
referred to for a more detailed discussion.

Resource Endowment
1.04      At present, hydrocarbons and hydropower are the only two sources of
primary commercial energy in Egypt. The specifics of Egypt's resource endow-
ment, along with other potential sources of energy, are considered below:
(a) Hydropower
1.05      Hydropower for Egypt is an important source of energy and in 1978 it
accounted for 19% of primary commercial energy used domestically. By equipping
the Aswan Dam with turbine generators having a cumulative capacity of 345 NW,
the first step was taken in 1960 to tap the hydropower potential of the
River Nile. The Aswan High Dam was completed between 1960 and 1970, seven
miles upstream of the Aswan Dam, and equipped with a generating capacity of
1/   Consisting of Egypt's share of production of 17.1 million tons and
foreign partners share of 7.3 million tons.
2/   Estimated.  Used largely to meet metallurgical requirements.
3/   Conversion factor 1000 kWh = 0.286 tons of oil (assuming 30% efficiency).
4/   55,000 tons of gas purchased from partners.
5/   Includes stock change.
6/   Consists of 5.06 million tons (net) of exports by Egypt and 7.20 million
tons of exports by foreign partners.



- 3 -
2,100 MW.  The ope-rational capabilities of both the Aswan Dams is severely
constrained by coiflicting irrigation needs and transmission systems reli-
ability. At present the dependable generating capacity of both these plants
is currently assessed at 1,645 MW, capable of generating nine billion kWh
annually. With the completion of the Aswan High Dam, about 80% of the Nile's
hydropower has been harnessed. 1/ The remaining 60 meter drop between Aswan
and Cairo represents a generating potential of 460 MW, of which 190 MW could
possibly be realized by adding generating facilities in three existing
barrages: Nag Hammadi, Esna, and Assiut. The Qattara depression represents
the only other hydropower possibility in Egypt. It would, however, involve
canalizing water from the Mediterranean Sea to the Qattara depression (which
extends 135 meters below sea level), and using the 60 meter descent to generate
power. The power capabilities of this project are estimated at 640 MW during
the first 12 years, and 340 MW thereafter. However, the construction of the
proposed canal would require massive excavation, and it is doubtful whether
this project could be viewed as a serious possibility over the next 20 years.
(b) Coal, Oil Shale and Nuclear Fuels
1.06      Coal deposits have been discovered in the Western Desert and in
the Sinai Peninsula and, as mentioned above, a feasibility study for a coal-
fired power plant in the Sinai is under preparation. Oil shale deposits have
also been located in the Sinai Peninsula and are 10-15 feet thick. The data
indicates that the shale is of poor quality and having low hydrocarbons
content it cannot at present be considered as a possible energy source. No
uranium or thorium is currently being produced in Egypt. An extensive ground
radio-metric work would have to be conducted before reserves could be identi-
fied. Even if prospecting activities were accelerated, it is doubtful that
Egypt would be in a position to mine and extract nuclear fuel during the
eighties.
(c) Geothermal and Solar Energy
1.07      Limited information is available on the existence of geothermal
energy as only a few geochemical and heat flow measurements have been made.
Since there is no evidence to indicate the existence of a high temperature
(greater than 200 degree centigrade) vapour dominated system, geothermal
activity cannot be considered a potential source of energy for power genera-
tion, etc. However, Egypt has a vast potential for solar energy, but this
source must await a series of technological breakthroughs before it can
be considered for extensive application.
(d) Non-Commercial Energy
1.08      Although no data base exists for quantifying the extent of non-
commercial energy use in Egypt, it is apparent that this form of energy
1/   In the context of the proposed third power project scheduled for FY80,
an additional 270 MW are expected to be generated through an expansion
of the Aswan Dam.

constitutes a significant proportion of the total energy use, especially
in the rural areas. However, Egypt is not well endowed in biomass, with
only 2.7% of its territory under permanent or seasonal crops, the rest being
desert, or areas covered with dry or extremely arid vegetation. Only a
nominal area is under forests and, therefore, crop residues and animal wastes
are the main sources of non-commercial energy. According to a recent esti-
mate, this form of energy currently caters to one-fourth of Egypt's total
energy requirements. As in other developing countries, the level of utiliza-
tion of animal and vegetable wastes is very high although the end use effi-
ciency is low - typically 10% to 15%. Considerable potential exists for
upgrading the end use efficiency through improved appliances.
1.09      While the use of non-commercial fuel is likely to increase over
time, its relative share is anticipated to decline rapidly. Rural households
are gradually replacing non-commercial fuels with kerosene, LPG and electric
power. This trend is likely to strengthen over the next twenty years since the
major source of non-commercial fuel will continue to be crop residue which is
not likely to keep pace with even the growing rural demand. Urban households
would therefore have to rely almost exclusively on mineral fuels. Presently
there is a strong consumer preference for LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) over
kerosene in the urban areas, and with growing urbanization, its demand is
likely to grow. However, indigenous natural gas can replace imported LPG
and this is one of the objectives of the proposed project.
(e) Oil
1.10      Oil is a major source of commercial energy in Egypt and because
of limited hydro potential it is likely to be relied upon increasingly to meet
Egypt's incremental demand for energy. Although the first oil well was
drilled in 1886, oil exploration was not done on a systematic basis until
the turn of the century. Commercial production began in 1913, but it was
only after 1968 that oil production exceeded 10 million tons. To date, 39
commercially exploitable oil and gas fields have been discovered. The current
production level is around 500,000 barrels a day, (25 million tons per annum)
of which about 25% represents the share of foreign partners, 45% is consumed
domestically and the balance is exported. The recoverable reserves are
currently estimated at around 2.5 billion barrels (350 million tons).
1.11      There are three main hydrocarbon bearing zones in Egypt:  the Gulf
of Suez, the Western Desert, and the Nile Delta. Of these, the Gulf of Suez
has been the most prolific producer and is reckoned to hold the highest
potential. More than 300 exploratory wells have been drilled in this area,
resulting in the delineation of 28 fields. Currently more than 90% of
Egypt's oil is produced from the Gulf of Suez. The Western Desert has been
extensively surveyed and more than 200 exploratory wells have been drilled.
The success ratio of this extensive exploration has, however, been limited.
So far only seven commercial discoveries have been made and the recoverable
reserves are estimated at 30 million tons. The current level of production
from the Western Desert is less than a million tons. Despite limited
success, the hope of making a major strike persists, as giant fields have
been discovered in similar structures in neighboring countries. Exploratory
drilling has been carried out in the Nile Delta, the Red Sea, and in the Nile



- 5 -
Basin, but no oil has been discovered. However, four gas fields have been
found in the Nile Delta, of which only one, Abu Maadi, is considered commer-
cially exploitable. With the transfer of territories under Israeli occupation,
in November 1979, Egypt secured the Alma oil field, which is reported to
be producing 20,000 bbl/day or 1 million tons of oil per annum. The hydro-
carbon potential of this area is rated high, warranting an extensive explora-
tory effort.
(f) Natural Gas
Associated Gas
1.12      The current production level of associated gas in Egypt is around
100 million cubic feet a day (Mmcf/d), and, except for a nominal amount which
is being used for meeting oil field needs, the rest is being flared. Most of
the associated gas comes from the oil fields in the Gulf of Suez. Recent
discoveries have added to the availability of associated gas and, according
to the Gulf of Suez Gas project, present estimates of recoverable reserves of
associated gas are in the order of 800 billion cubic feet. The Bank, through
Loan 1732-EGT, is financing a project which would gather, process, and
transport this gas to Suez and Cairo.
Non-Associated Gas
1.13      Non-associated gas on a commercially exploitable scale has been dis-
covered at Abu Ghardig, Abu Maadi, Abu Qir, Abu Qir North, and the Amal fields.
The specifics of the afore-mentioned gas fields are as follows:
(i)  Abu Ghardig
This gas field was discovered in 1971, has an estimated
recoverable reserve of 0.6 trillion cubic feet, and is operated
by GUPCO (Gulf of Suez Petroleum Company), a subsidiary of
AMOCO, (American Oil Company) and EGPC, (Egyptian General Petroleum
Corporation). GUPCO has been producing gas from this field since
1977. The production sharing agreement provides that even the
foreign partner's share (AMOCO) will be sold to EGPC on the basis
of a predetermined formula. This gas is transported from Abu
Ghardig through a 24" pipeline over 370 kilometers to Helwan, near
Cairo. Petrogas will secure supplies for the proposed project
from the gas terminal located at Mrazik Bridge, on the east
side of the River Nile.
(ii)  Abu Maadi
This gas field was discovered in the Nile Delta by ENI
(Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi). After the renegotiation of the
production sharing agreement its ownership was transferred to
the Egyptian Government and the field is now being operated by
Petrobel (Belayim Petroleum Company), a subsidiary of EGPC. The
recoverable reserves of this field are estimated at one trillion
cubic feet, capable of supplying 100 Mmcf/d for about 25 years.



-6-
(iii)  Abu Qir
This offshore gas field, located on the periphery of
the Western Desert and the Nile Basin, was discovered by
Philips Petroleum in 1969. EGPC, as its partner, developed
the field under the "sole risk" clause of the participation
agreement. Now in the exclusive ownership of EGPC, this
gas field is estimated to have recoverable reserves
of 1.2 trillion cubic feet which would sustain a supply
of 100 MMcf/d for around 30 years. A 57 kilometer pipeline,
with a capacity of 100 MMcf/d, has been constructed from
Abu Qir to Alexandria and from there to Damanhur via Kafr
El Dawar.
(iv)  Abu Qir North
Elf-Aquitaine has recently discovered an offshore gas
field which is located 55 km northeast of Alexandria and about
20 km north of the existing Abu Qir gas fields. So far, one
exploration well has been drilled and tested. Gas bearing sands
were encountered in two zones, having a net pay of 64.5 meters
and 185 meters respectively. The gas is relatively rich in
condensates which are estimated at 25 bbl/MMcf. While further
drilling would be required to fully delineate the field, recov-
erable reserves from the existing production data are estimated
at three trillion cubic feet.
(v)  Amal Field
This gas field, located offshore in the Gulf of Suez, was
discovered by AMOCO and has recoverable reserves of 0.5 trillion
cubic feet. AMOCO has relinquished its rights to this gas
field which will be developed by EGPC, if necessary, to
supplement the associated gas supply to Suez and Cairo.

Exploration Policy
1.15      For exploration, development and production of oil, Egypt has
consistently followed an 'open-door policy' and almost all exploration and
production work undertaken within the country has been through foreign oil
companies. The exploration agreements have evolved from the 'concessions' of
the pre-1960's to participation agreements which were subsequently converted
into production sharing agreements. Under the current production sharing
agreements, the cost of exploration and development is borne exclusively by
foreign contractors and amortized, interest free, over the next 4 and 8 years
respectively. After taking these costs into account, (as well as operating
costs), 'profit oil' 2/ is shared between the foreign contractors and Egypt in
a given ratio. In successive agreements, Egypt has improved upon its share of
profit oil, and some agreements have been concluded recently in which Egypt's
share of profit oil has been negotiated at 87%.
1.16      The exploration policy, as pursued by Egypt, has served well the
Government's objective of maximizing oil production without bearing any risk
of exploration. Of the present production level of 500,000 barrels per day,
as much as 470,000 barrels are produced from these concessions. Since 1973,
Egypt has made conscious efforts to invite foreign companies, and 53 explora-
tion and production agreements have been entered into for an area covering
about 160,000 sq. kms. At present, the foreign contractors share oil with the
national oil company in the ratio of 1:3 on average. Even at the anticipated
higher level of production, the share of foreign contractors is not likely to
decrease significantly.

Current and Anticipated Level of Oil Production
1.17      There has been an impressive recovery in the production of oil in
Egypt, which increased from 11.5 million tons in 1974 to 20.9 million tons
in 1977, a level which had earlier been attained in 1969. Growth in the
petroleum sector slowed thereafter and crude output grew by 17% (24.3 million
tons) in 1978 and 3% (25.1 million tons) in 1979, against an average annual
growth of about 40% in the previous three years. The slowdown in oil
production reflects the lack of any major new discovery and the fact that
oil fields in the Gulf of Suez, which currently account for 80% of Egypt's
oil production, are peaking. Despite the slowdown, EGPC is projecting a
significant increase in the level of oil production as indicated in the table
below.

EGPC ancitipates a sharp upswing in petroleum production which is projected to
exceed 35 million tons by 1981 and to reach a level of 46.5 million tons in
1983. It hopes to maintain this production level thereafter. Attainment of
the projected production rate is predicated upon new discoveries being made
which will not only double the current level of production but would also
compensate for the decline in production from oil fields which have already
peaked. Failure to achieve the assumed discovery ratio could result in
a significant shortfall. In any case, the lags which are inherent in the
development of an oil field will make it extremely difficult to achieve the
targets originally stipulated for the 1978-82 five year plan.

Demand for Oil & Natural Gas
1.18      Consumption of petroleum products has been rising rapidly and for
1979 is estimated at 11.7 million tons. This is against a consumption of 9.1
million tons in 1977 and 6.7 million tons in 1974. The overall annual growth
rate has been in the order of 11.8% with LPG recording the sharpest increase
(16%). Consumption of LPG would have been higher except for the physical
constraint of supply. Over the next two years EGPC projects a growth rate of
12.5%. It is anticipated that, in the absence of demand management and/or
significant increase in the price levels, this growth rate in consumption
would be maintained until 1985. This relatively high growth rate is attribut-
able in part to rapidly growing thermal power generation which is projected
to rise from 17 Gwh in 1980 to 28 billion Gwh in 1985. The growth rate beyond
1985 would depend, in part, on the introduction of coal-fired power plants and
of nuclear power. Egypt hopes to commission the first nuclear plant (600 MW)
in 1990. Delays in the nuclear program would result in a greater reliance on
fossil fuels for power generation. Based on past trends and on the assumption
that the gross national product grows at about 6.5% in real terms, the antici-
pated consumption pattern would be as indicated in the table below.

1.19      The projected demand for hydrocarbons by 1985 would be around 23
million tons. A qualitative change in the pattern of consumption is, however,
anticipated with natural gas being increasingly used as a substitute for
liquid hydrocarbons. Egypt is making conscious efforts to increase the
absorptive capacity for natural gas. The current production potential is 300
MMcf/d against a demand of 110 MMcf/d. The situation would reverse itself by
1985 when the peak potential demand of about 950 MMcf/d (average demand of 700
MMcf/d) is expected to outstrip the production potential of 400 MMcf/d (Annex
1.02). The gap between the projected demand and the likely supply of gas
would have to be covered by liquid hydrocarbons which could otherwise have
been exported. Egypt would have to increase its exploratory efforts for gas
and accelerate the program of developing known gas fields, in order to maintain
its status as an exporter of oil.
Prices and Fiscal Contribution of the Sector
1.20      Worldwide price increases and the consequent drop in the growth
rates of oil consumption has had little impact in Egypt where domestic prices
are well below international levels. The pump head prices are fixed through a
governmental decree, and the revenue accruing to the government and EGPC
results from the sale of products, net of refining, marketing and transporta-
tion costs. Current product prices and the estimated costs of refining,
transporting, and marketing, are indicated below:

1.21      EGPC secures a 'netback' of around US$4.0 per barrel from domestic
sales. Even after the excise and treasury dues are taken into account, the
total revenue to the economy from the sale of crude in the domestic market is
around $7 per barrel. This is against a price of $33 per barrel which EGPC
is currently receiving from the export of oil. If Egypt were to price oil at
international prices it would, at the present level of consumption, secure
annual additional revenue in excess of $2.2 billion.
Sector Issues and Role of the Bank
1.22      The review of Egypt's energy sector, carried out during and subse-
quent to the appraisal of the Gulf of Suez gas project, indicated the need
for Egypt to take major decisions in order to optimize the use of internal
energy resources and to ensure adequate supply for the future. Some of these
crucial issues are considered below. In order to assist Egypt in taking these
decisions, the Bank is providing the Government and EGPC with the necessary
technical assistance.
(a) Level of Oil Production
1.23      Egypt's economic projections are based on the assumption that it
will, by 1983, achieve a target of one million barrels per day or about 50
million tons per annum. This production rate depends upon new discoveries
being made which will not only double the current level of production, but
will also compensate for the shortfall in production from the old oil fields
which have peaked. It is uncertain whether these targets will be achieved.
Despite the fact that Egypt has entered into as many as 53 production sharing
agreements, the interest of foreign oil companies appears to be slackening.
New discoveries have not kept pace with increased output and the production
reserve ratio has been falling over the past few years.
1.24      Egypt could stem this trend by reorganizing, coallating, and rein-
terpreting the existing geological, seismic and drilling data. The Bank has
(under the Gulf of Suez project) provided the necessary funds to undertake
this study. A part of this study, involving a few prospects in the Western
Desert and offshore Abu Qir, has been completed. Terms of reference for a
similar study in the Nile Delta and the remainding areas of the Western Desert
have been finalized and consultants are being selected.
(b) Pricing Policy
1.25      Egypt has, as of January 1980, increased the prices of motor gaso-
line, diesel oil, gas oil, and kerosene. Although, with this price increase
the netback (including excise taxes etc.) has increased from $4 per barrel to
$7 per barrel (para. 1,21), yet it remains well below the current export price
of $33 per barrel of crude. By maintaining domestic prices at this level,
Egypt is losing the unique opportunity of using its finite petroleum wealth to
increase domestic resources. In addition, such a pricing policy encourages
wasteful consumption. In the absence of major new discoveries, the peaking
oil fields and the sharply rising internal demand could transform Egypt from
an exporter into a net importer of oil by the mid-eighties. In order to curb
wasteful consumption and rectify demand distortions, prices for petroleum
products would have to be increased significantly. Increasing domestic prices



- 12 -
of energy resources to approximate inernational levels should be the goal
of the national energy pricing policy. However, this is a long term objec-
tive which is primarily determined by the ability of the Egyptian economy to
structurally adjust and absorb the new high prices. This adjustment is
particularly difficult in the Egyptian economy with its extensive system of
subsidies, price controls, and quantity rationing. Because of these complex
interlinkages, a study to evaluate options and the effects on end prices was
financed under the first loan to EGPC. The Bank is closely involved in moni-
toring and directing the progress of that study. At the completion of the
study (June 1981), the Government of Egypt (GOE) has covenanted to review its
recommendations with the Bank and agree upon a course of action. Pending the
outcome of the above study, the Bank intends to continue its dialogue with the
Government, in connection with the ongoing and proposed gas and power projects,
aimed at bringing about improvements in the energy pricing policy effecting
key petroleum products and electricity tariffs. In this context, under the
proposed project, agreement has been reached to increase the price of natural
gas for domestic consumers to a level which is above its current opportunity
cost as a fuel oil replacement (paragraph 4.14, and 5.13).
(c) Natural Gas--Availability and Optimum Use
1.26      Significant gas discoveries have been made in Egypt over the last
few years. Presently, the production potential of natural gas is greater than
demand. This situation is likely to reverse itself over the next few years,
when gas demand will well exceed possible supplies. This imbalance would
result in the diversion of liquid hydrocarbons from export to the domestic
market. Since foreign oil companies have little interest in developing gas
resources for domestic consumption, EGPC would have to take the initiative
in gas exploration especially in structures known to hold gas potential. In
order to develop an exploration plan, Bank financed consultants have carried
out seismic interpretations of some of these structures (Abu Senan, Block 29,
28, 27 in the Western Desert, East Abu Qir, etc.). Results of this study have
been very positive warranting early drilling in five prospects. Separately,
production facilities at Abu Qir need to be augmented by adding production
wells, and the Abu Qir North field rapidly delineated, developed, and linked
to Cairo. Bank-financed consultants are studying methods of augmenting the
production facilities in Abu Qir.
1.27      Related to the above is the question of optimum use of gas.  The
Bank is currently financing a study to address the questions of gas use
optimization and the need to upgrade this resource from a fuel oil equivalent
to higher value uses. Even now, before the study is completed, there are
known areas where gas may be used as a substitute for liquid fuels thereby
increasing exports (fuel oil) and reducing imports (LPG and kerosene).
Government policy has encouraged such substitutions since, in recent years,
GOE has faced increasing difficulties in meeting domestic consumer demand in
large urban areas at a reasonable cost. The international prices for LPG and
kerosene (the two main fuels used) have increased rapidly, putting a heavy and
constant burden on Egypt's balance of payments. In addition, the rapid change
taking place in Cairo from low level housing to modern high rise buildings,
makes the regular use of portable fuels extremely hazardous.



- 13 -
1.28      There are only two alternatives for catering to the needs of
domestic consumers in urban areas, namely, electricity or piped gas. The
government has reviewed these alternatives and concluded correctly that elec-
tricity would not be energy efficient and would be more costly than gas. It
therefore decided to embark on a program to create gas distribution networks
in the major cities. The first step in this program, for which the government
has requested IDA assistance, would be the construction of a gas distribution
network in four districts of Cairo: Maadi, Helwan, Heliopolis, and Nasr City
which, because of the nature of the housing and the level of consumers, appear
to be the most suitable. This project should be followed by the expansion of
gas distribution to other areas in Cairo and in Alexandria.
II. THE PROJECT
Background
2.01      The availability of natural gas opens up a new set of energy options
for Egypt. Most of the natural gas will be used as a replacement for fuel
oil which can then be exported. Through Loan No. 1732-EGT the Bank supported
this objective with a project to gather, process, and transport natural gas
from the Gulf of Suez to Suez and Cairo. Through the proposed gas distribution
project, natural gas would be used to reduce Egypt's import dependence by
replacing LPG and gas oil. The Government of Egypt approached the World Bank
for financing the proposed project in January 1978. The project design,
prepared by EGPC's consultants, was reviewed by the Bank mission and found to
be sub-optimal. The gas distribution network was accordingly redesigned and
the project appraised in October, 1979.
2.02      City Gas is not new to Cairo.  A gas distribution network was
established in Cairo by a French company, Lebon, in 1870. Gas for this net-
work was produced initially from coal. In 1948 GOE took over the management
and operation of City Gas, and the Egyptian Electricity Authority currently
operates this network, producing gas from naphtha. Over the years the network
has developed extensive leaks, and fallen into disrepair and partial disuse.
Gas services have been curtailed and presently only 5,000 customers are being
serviced. Since the area covered by this system (central Cairo) is different
from the area under the proposed project, it is doubtful whether it would be
economically feasible to rehabilitate and convert this system to natural gas
and link it with the proposed project. Nonetheless, during negotiations, GOE
has agreed to carry out, by June 30, 1981, a study for this purpose and to
implement any recommendations mutually agreed with the Bank.
Project Objective
2.03      In order to reduce its reliance on imports, Egypt proposes to use
natural gas, available within the country, as a replacement for LPG, kerosene,
and gas oil. As a first step in this direction, the proposed project aims at
creating a gas distribution network in the four districts of Cairo---Helwan,
Maadi, Nasr City, and Heliopolis. In so doing, natural gas use would be up-
graded from a substitute for fuel oil, to a replacement for high value products
like LPG and gas oil. Currently Egypt imports 70% of its LPG requirements, as



- 14 -
well as marginal quantities of gas oil. This project would thus generate
significant foreign exchange savings and make the Egyptian economy less
vulnerable to external price fluctuations.
Gas Supply & Reserves
2.04      The sources of gas supply for the proposed project would be the oil
and gas field at Abu Ghardig, south of El Alamein, about 270 kms from Cairo.
This field was discovered in 1971, has estimated recoverable reserves of
600 billion scf and is being operated by GUPCO, a subsidiary of AMOCO and
EGPC. Twenty one wells have been drilled so far, of which eleven are produc-
ing oil and five gas. While oil is transported to El Alamein, associated gas,
(15 MMcf/d), and non-associated gas, (50 MMcf/d), is piped to Cairo, after
removal of condensates, through a 24" pipeline. LPG is extracted, (145 tonnes
per day) at the Dahshour plant, and the dry gas is currently available at
Mrazik Bridge on the East Bank of the River Nile. Petrogas, the beneficiary
and implementing agency under the project, would take its supply for the
project from this point. The current proven reserves, (600 Billion scf), if
exclusively dedicated to the project, are adequate to support it over its
economic life of 30 years.
2.05      Additional gas in significant quantities will be needed in the
future to meet the rapidly rising demand in Cairo (para 1.19). At that time
gas supply to Cairo for power generation and other industrial uses would need
to be supplemented by:
(a) Gas from the Gulf of Suez project currently being financed
by the World Bank (Loan No. 1732-EGT);
(b) Drilling and developing possible gas fields at Abu Sennan
and in the blocks 29, 28, 27, and 5-1 in the Western
Desert, adjacent to the existing Abu Ghardig gas fields.
Gas shows have been encountered and in the context of the
Gulf of Suez gas project the Bank is currently financing
reinterpretation of drilling and seismic data relating to
these structures; and
(c) Development, and tie-in to Cairo, of Abu Qir North gas
field recently discovered offshore, which has estimated gas
reserves of at least three trillion cft.
Assurances have been obtained from EGPC that it would operate
the gas fields at Abu Ghardig, (or other gas fields subsequently discovered
and/or linked with the Cairo gas distribution system) in a manner permitting
the availability of gas for the system over a period of at least 16 years
after project completion.
Project Area and Consumption
2.06      The project area is composed of four suburbs on the south-east side
of Cairo (IBRD Map No. 14728). Factors responsible for the selection of these
four districts were proximity to the gas source, relative ease in laying the



- 15 -
distribution network and undertaking carcassing, 1/ density of accessible
consumers, and future growth potential. All the selected districts are cur-
rently heavy users of LPG and are expected to grow rapidly in terms of high
rise housing, which lends itself ideally to a viable gas distribution network.
These areas are:
(i) Helwan - a rapidly expanding industrial city 12 kms south
of Cairo and close to the pipeline offtake point at Mrazik
Bridge.
(ii) Maadi - a suburb 5 kms south of Cairo, a relatively affluent
residential area consisting of a mix of mid and low rise
housing. High rise housing is expected to increase.
(iii) Nasr City - a rapidly developing district with mostly
high rise housing, 6 kms south-east of Cairo.
(iv) Heliopolis - a district 10 kms north-east of Cairo, an
extensive sprawling area with large pockets of new develop-
ments consisting of high rise housing.
2.07      The proposed project would provide gas to nearly all households in
the four areas. For logistical reasons certain parts of Helwan have been
excluded. The existing population, and expected growth, is shown below: 2/

2.08      Between 1980-83 the project would convert 160,000 existing house-
holds from LPG to Natural Gas. In addition, during the same period, it is
estimated that 30,000 new dwellings ("infill") needing gas connections would
be built in the project area. The responsibility for internal carcassing
and external piping up to the periphery of the property line, in new housing,
would rest with the builder. Petrogas would be required to provide service
lines from the "mains" to the property line. It is estimated that by the end
of 1983 there will be 190,000 consumers which would increase to 640,000 by
year 2005.
2.09      The average consumption of LPG per customer, as estimated by the
consultant and subsequently confirmed by a survey, is about 315 kilograms
per annum. However, considerable variation is observed in family consumption
which appears to be correlated with income levels. It has been assumed that
initial gas consumption would be at the same level as LPG (13,000 scf per
annum per customer), but once a piped gas supply becomes available, the
consumption per household would grow at 1% per annum. While the average
consumption per consumer is estimated at 35 scf per day, the peak hour require-
ment is likely to be 7.3 scf per hour. A simulated demand curve gives a 43%
diurnal swing with a peak hour to mean hour ratio of 4.8:1. Demand for gas by
domestic consumers is estimated at 8 MMcf/d in the fifth year and 19 MMcf/d by
the twentieth year.
2.10      The proposed gas system would also meet the requirements of power
stations at Nasr City and Heliopolis. These stations are gas turbine units
designed to meet peak loads. However, because of the delay in the imple-
mentation of the Suez power plant, these stations would operate for 4,000
hours per annum, at least up to 1986. In the event of the proposed steam
turbine stations going on stream as scheduled, the load on these gas turbine
stations may reduce after 1986. It has been assumed that the gas load through
1986 would be cumulatively of the order of 12 Mmcf/d, (Nasr City 7 Mmcf/d,
Heliopolis 5 Mmcf/d) whereafter the gas load would decrease by 50%. Even if
the gas load on account of these power stations does not diminish after 1986,
the gas network would be able to meet, through compression, both the needs of
these stations and the growing domestic demand.
Project Design
2.11      EGPC, with the assistance of consultants, prepared a detailed project
report for the gas distribution network in the four districts of Cairo. IDA
reviewed the network design, which was based on a low pressure system, and
found it to be expensive and inflexible. EGPC accordingly appointed new
consultants, British Gas, to redesign the gas network based on a medium
pressure system, which would operate at four bar. The consultants used
transient flow analysis to design the gas network. This entails dividing the
transmission system into small cells and examining each cell for pressure drop
resulting from flow effect and stock requirements. A computer program devel-
oped by British Gas was used to determine the size of the pipeline. The high
pressure transmission line is optimally sized to serve the ultimate target of
640,000 customers, eliminating the need for separate storage capacity to meet
peak requirements at least up to 1992. The high pressure transmission line
would work at 26 bar, and four regulator stations would drop the inlet pressure



- 17 -
to four bar, a pressure at which the distribution network would operate. 1/
Medium density polyethylene pipe would be used for the distribution network,
while pipes above ground level would be made of steel. For safety reasons,
the pressure would be reduced to 50 millibars three meters from the property
line. Gas would be fed into the property, through service risers, which would
be located either in the ventilation shafts, or attached to the external walls
of the property. A schematic diagram of the proposed gas system is at ANNEX
2.01.
2.12      The project authority (Petrogas) would be responsible for internal
carcassing in 160,000 existing apartments, and conversion 2/ of 300,000 existing
appliances from LPG to natural gas. In buildings subsequently constructed in
the project area, the builder would be responsible for providing the internal
carcassing, risers and external piping, up to the periphery of the property
line. GOE has covenanted to issue a decree, prior to December 31, 1980,
obligating the builder to discharge the above responsibility under Petrogas
supervision. Draft legislation has already been prepared by Petrogas.
Description of the Project
2.13      The major project components are:
(a) Transmission System
(i)  Construction of approximately 55 km of 24" buried steel
pipeline from an existing installation near Mrazik Bridge
to a proposed power station at Heliopolis, along with the
necessary system for cathodic protection;
(ii)  Installation of inlet and odorizing plants near Mrazik Bridge;
(iii)  Construction of four pressure reduction stations at Helwan,
Maadi, Nasr City, and Heliopolis, with offtake from the main
line. Each of the stations would consist basically of three
separate preassembled skid-mounted units for filtration,
pressure reduction, and metering, with connecting manifolds;
(iv)   Installation of offtake for the proposed power stations at Nasr
City and Heliopolis, with a terminal at Heliopolis;
(v)   Installation of pigging system complete with pig traps,
launchers, and receiving station.
1/   For reasons of safety, and/or where the streets are narrow, low pressure
islands would be created.
2/   This involves converting existing appliances (essentially cookers, ovens
and water heaters) from burning LPG, to burn natural gas. In most cases
this would require a change of jets, in some cases replacement of burners
and in very few cases, the appliance itself.



- 18 -
(b) Distribution System
(i)   Installation of a distribution network of medium density
polyethylene pipe, approximately 900 km in length, in the
project area;
(ii)   Provision of approximately 9,000 services for connecting
customers with gas, at an average rate of about one service
for 18 customers.
(c) Carcassing & Conversion
(i)   Installation of outlet service pipes from ten feet outside
the dwelling to the gas meters along with service risers,
laterals, etc.;
(ii)   Internal installation of pipes in about 160,000 dwellings
to function at a pressure not exceeding 30 millibars
complete with gas meters, pipe ducts, control cocks, etc.;
(iii)   Conversion of about 300,000 existing appliances burning
LPG, to burn natural gas.
(d) Training & Consultancy
Consultancy, engineering, and training of Egyptian personnel in
various aspects of construction, maintenance, and operation of a
gas utility.
Project Cost
2.14      The project cost is estimated at LE107.6 million (US$155.0 million)
of which LE72.0 million (US$103.8 million) would be in foreign exchange.
Basic project cost of LE86.3 million (US$124.3 million) is based on the firm
bids 1/ received from the lowest evaluated bidder. It must, however, be noted
that an element of uncertainty remains in regard to cost estimates for internal
carcassing and conversion of appliances. Petrogas, at the Bank's suggestion,
undertook a sample survey to estimate the average length of service lines,
risers, laterals, and carcassing required per household, and to assess the
density, diversity, and condition of appliances. While the cost estimates
take note of the survey, the possibility of deviation, in the actual cost for
carcassing and conversions, cannot be excluded. In the light of construction
experience, Petrogas will periodically review and refine cost estimates.
GOE/EGPC have agreed to assume responsibility for any cost overruns that may
arise.
2.15      In computing cost estimates, physical contingencies have been
estimated, on the average, at 10% for equipment, material, and consultancy
1/   Bids were invited on unit rate basis and evaluated on a detailed estimate
of quantities. While these estimates are fairly firm for the transmis-
sion network, the quantities involving carcassing and conversion are
likely to undergo modification as detailed design progresses.

services. A physical contingency of 3Z has been assumed for the high pressure
transmission pipeline, odorizing unit, pressure regulating stations, and gas
meters. A relatively low contingency factor has been assumed as contract for
these items has been awarded on a fixed rate basis. A contingency factor of
10% has been assumed for the distribution network and 15% for carcassing of
apartments and conversion of appliances. Engineering and consultancy services
have been calculated on a unit cost of US$9,000 per man month. This rate was
derived from the existing contract between Petrogas and its consultants. In
accordance with the contract, no price escalation has been assumed for the
first year. Price escalation for year two has been assumed at 92 fQr the
foreign exchange component and 12% for local expenditure, at 8% and 7%
for the foreign exchange cost component for years three and fQur, and at 11%
for both those years for local expenditures. Since Petrogas is exempt from
import duty, no allowance has been made for this purpose in cost estimates.
2.16      Estimated costs for the project are summarized below.

The proposed credit of US$50 million would represent 48% of the project's
foreign exchange cost and would be used to finance 100% of the foreign
exchange cost of items 1 to 3, 4(i), 4(ii), 4(iii), and (together with US$2.5
million provided under Loan 1732-EGT) 100% of expenditures on items 9 and 10.
EGPC and GOE have agreed to finance local currency expenditure, equivalent to
US$45.3 million and foreign exchange expenditure equivalent to US$51.3 million,
plus costs of any overruns. The proposed credit would be made to the Arab
Republic of Egypt, who, in turn, would onlend the proceeds to Petrogas through
a subsidiary loan agreement. The loan to Petrogas would be for a period of 20
years with a grace period of five years at a 8.25% annual rate of interest.
Allocation and Disbursement of Credit
2.18      The proposed credit of US$50 million would be disbursed as follows:

Retroactive financing of US$5 million will be provided for expenditure
incurred by Petrogas, (essentially downpayments) on items proposed to be
financed by IDA, between November 22, 1979 (date of the award of contract)
and the date of the signature of the credit. It is anticipated that the
credit would be fully disbursed by June, 1984.
Implementation
2.20      Petrogas would have overall responsibility for implementing the
proposed project. EGPC as a holding company will provide Petrogas with all
the necessary support to complete and operate the project. Petrogas has
appointed British Gas as its Engineering Consultants, who will assist in
designing and supervising the construction of the project. This arrangement
is considered satisfactory. Since consultants are important in the success-
ful implementation of the project, assurance has been obtained that Petrogas
will continue to employ experienced consultants, on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Association. Consistent with current practice in the gas
industry, Petrogas has awarded a single responsibility contract for the entire
project. The selected contractor would be responsible for detailed engineer-
ing, construction of the high pressure pipeline, the distribution network,
carcassing of dwellings and conversion of appliances. Undertaking discrete
components of the project through separate contractors would have presented
serious coordination problems, particularly at several points of interface,
where problems of safety are most acute. In Egypt there is little or no
expertise in the construction of domestic gas distribution networks, especially
with polyethylene pipes. The contractor would therefore need to employ a
large expatriate workforce to implement the project. The contractor would
initially employ 40 expatriates, which would increase to 140 in the second
year and decline smoothly over the next two years as these skills are tran-
sferred to the local workforce.
2.21      The contractor has agreed to a detailed construction schedule and
is committed to complete the project within a period of four years. The
implementation schedule requires the contractor to complete the entire high
pressure transmission pipeline, odorization plant, and the pressure regulation
stations within the first year. The yearly schedule for the distribution
network and conversion of appliances is as indicated in the table below.

The proposed project is scheduled to be completed by December, 1983.  The
master schedule showing the timing and completion dates of various project-
related activities is in ANNEX 2.03. CPM for the Transmission Pipeline,
odorization plant, and pressure regulation station is in ANNEX 2.04 and the
logic diagram for the remaining activities is in ANNEX 2.05.
2.22      Although the selected contractor is responsible for building the
project on a turnkey basis, it would nonetheless impose a considerable burden
on the organization of Petrogas. For this reason Petrogas' organizational
requirements, recruitment schedule, and the training needs were evaluated.
Immediate recruitment and training needs were identified and agreed upon
during appraisal. Other important organizational issues were separately
identified during apraisal and consultants were asked to undertake necessary
studies. Recommendations based on these studies were reviewed during nego-
tiation, (for fuller treatment of these issues see Section 3.07 to 3.11).
Procurement
2.23      Because of the considerations stated in Para. 2.20 and reviewed by
IDA prior to appraisal, Petrogas decided to award a single responsibility
contract for the entire project. Petrogas, through extensive local and
international advertisements, invited contractors to prequalify; 50 firms
responded to Petrogas' invitation. The criterion used for prequalification
was based on the contractors' previous experience in distribution networks,
organizational capability, financial standing, and experience in the Middle
East. Primarily because experience in gas distribution, along with carcassing
and conversion is relatively rare, only nine contractors prequalified. Tender
documents were prepared by Petrogas' consultants, in response to which three
bids were received from prequalified contractors. Petrogas, with the assis-
tance of its consultants, evaluated the bids and awarded the contract to the
lowest evaluated bidder on November 22, 1979. The Association 2/ reviewed the
procurement procedures, including the specifics of prequalification, and found
them generally to conform to its guidelines.
1/   In addition about 1800 services would need to be provided for an estimated
30,000 "infill" customers.  Most of these "infill" hookups would be
required in year three and four. It is assumed that by this time Petrogas
would have built up the necessary capability for providing this service
from within its own organization.
2/   Detailed IDA review of Petrogas' procurement procedures, responsive
nature and evaluation of bids is available on Project file.



- 23 -
2.24      The Bank agreed to advanced contracting because of the emergence of
exceptional conditions in the international oil market during and immediately
following bid preparation. Even prior to the current round of price escala-
tions, the cost of importing LPG and gas oil was US$170 per ton and US$140 per
ton respectively. Recent disruptions in oil supplies have increased the price
sharply; Egypt is presently importing LPG cargoes at a cost of $450 per ton.
By not allowing advanced contracting project implementation would have been
delayed significantly, increasing not only the project costs, but also sub-
stantially, the import burden. Before agreeing to advanced contracting:
(a)  It was assured that the overall project design is appropriate
(Para. 2.11).
(b)  GOE was advised that it was awarding the contract at its
own risk and that it did not in any fashion commit the
Association to grant a credit for the project; and
(c)  Executive Directors were advised of the possibility of
advanced contracting through the monthly Operational Summary.
Safety
2.25      All fuels carry with them the risk of fire or explosion through a
sudden release of energy; no gas system is immune from these risks. Natural
gas may escape through leaks in transmission and distribution lines, failure
of joints to remain gas-tight, leakage through pipe valves as a result of
conversion, or from ill-fitting and maladjusted connections, careless or
accidental misuse of appliances, etc. Fires in general have been more lethal
than even the most spectacular explosions.
2.26      The above risks notwithstanding, the use of natural gas in Cairo
would distinctly improve safety levels over those for LPG which is currently
being used as a domestic fuel. Natural gas is a safer fuel than LPG. Being
much lighter than air (specific gravity 0.58) it tends to dissipate rapidly
into the atmosphere when escaping from leaks. On the other hand, butane and
propane (LPG) being heavier than air, (specific gravity 1.96 and 1.47 respec-
tively), tend to settle on the ground providing the flammable source for
longer periods of time. In addition since the calorific value of LPG is
twice that of natural gas, energy release is much higher in the event of an
accident. The fact that LPG comes in movable containers with flexible connec-
tions makes it more prone to accident than a natural gas system which has
fixed outlets and couplings. In the United Kingdom accidents recorded in the
domestic sector from the use of LPG (per million therm) have been six times
higher than from natural gas. An increasing number of acccidents and fatali-
ties in Egypt, arising from LPG use, attest similarly to its hazards.
2.27      Nonetheless, the proposed gas system carries with it the risk of
serious accidents. With proper care, however, these risks can be reduced.
Customer and employee safety is a primary consideration for a gas utility.
To realize this goal, three main conditions must be assured: firstly, good
specifications that set out high material and construction standards; secondly,
well-defined and high standard operating practices and procedures; and finally,
a corps of well trained employees who observe established specifications,
standards, practices, and procedures, and routinely record and monitor actual
performance, to establish proof of adherence.



- 24 -
2.28      To meet the above requirements in the Cairo gas distribution project,
Petrogas has adopted British specifications where the gas system has a laudable
safety record. It has also hired a contractor with extensive experience in
laying gas networks and undertaking conversions in Europe. Separately, it
would need to establish a rigorous supervisory procedure to ensure that the
contractor adheres to specifications. This would, inter alia, require setting
up an independent safety organization to undertake a technical audit, initiating
a training program for the first line supervisors, and establishing a detailed
code for supervisory and safety tests. Consultants have been asked to assist
Petrogas in compiling, establishing and implementing a code for this purpose,
with expatriate assistance in the initial phase of the project. Preliminary
recommendations of the consultants were reviewed during negotiations; Petrogas
has agreed to codify the required procedures and after review with IDA imple-
ment them by December 31, 1980.
Ecology
2.29      No major environmental problems are likely to result from the imple-
mentation of the project. Natural gas is benign to the environment and its
extensive use as domestic fuel is likely to reduce the pollution level in
Cairo. The pipeline itself would pose no serious environmental hazard since
it would be buried, and measures would be taken to assure proper protection,
maintenance and operation. Design and construction would be in accordance
with appropriate codes and standards to minimize the chances of over-pres-
surization, corrosion, and third party damage.
Project Risk
2.30      Natural gas projects carry risks which can be minimized, but not
entirely eliminated. The project faces operational and geological risks, and
carries with it the risks of costly delays. None of these are significant
deterrents to the project. While all natural gas pipelines carry operational
risks of blow-ups, etc., industry has developed techniques and technology to
reduce them to a minimum level. The existing gas production facilities at
Abu Ghardig are operated by an experienced oil company (GUPCO). Proven gas
reserves are more than adequate to meet project needs. Possibilities of sig-
nificantly augmenting gas supplies for Cairo are high. Since Cairo is not in
the earthquake zone, other geological risks are minimal. However, slippages
in implementation are likely for a project of this nature and magnitude. It
is Petrogas' objective to convert 190,000 households to natural gas in the
first four years. While it should be possible to complete the transmission
pipeline within the stipulated time period (one year), the distribution
network, conversion, and carcassing could face delays. Project implementation
has been designed to attenuate these risks. The entire project has been
awarded to one contractor so as to reduce delays arising out of inadequate
coordination. In addition, substantial penalties for delays have been
stipulated in the contract. Similarly, the contract contains significant
incentives for early completion.
Schedule and Reporting
2.31      The proposed project is scheduled to be completed by December 31,
1984. During negotiations agreement has been reached with Petrogas to submit
monthly progress reports on each of the project sub-components.

III. BENEFICIARY
Background
3.01      LPG, presently the principal domestic fuel in the urban areas,
was first introduced in Egypt by Shell in 1935. The Bottle Gaz Company, a
local concessionaire, was in charge of distribution. In 1957, the Societe
Cooperative des Petroles, (COOP), a petroleum products marketing company and
presently fully-owned subsidiary of EGPC, took over the Bottle Gaz Company.
Petrogas was incorporated through a Decree in September, 1978, and is a fully
held subsidiary of EGPC. Besides assuming all functions relating to process-
ing, distributing, and marketing LPG in Egypt, it was primarily created
to promote and implement a natural gas distribution project which would
subsequently function as a gas utility. All LPG related assets have now
been transferred from COOP to Petrogas, with COOP functioning as a marketing
company for all other petroleum products.
3.02      EGPC functions as a holding company and by virtue of its statutes
oversees the entire spectrum of oil and oil-related operations within the
Egyptian economy. Its activities range from exploration to downstream
operations like marketing and refining. However, except for foreign trade
in crude oil and refined products, EGPC works through foreign partners,
(exploration) and fully-owned subsidiaries, (refining, transportation, and
marketing). These latter companies operate essentially on a cost plus basis
and charge EGPC a fee for processing and marketing crude oil and petroleum
products. Petrogas distributes and markets LPG on this basis.
Statutory Functions
3.03      The main functions of Petrogas under its charter of creation are
as follows:
(i) Provision for storing, filling, transporting, and marketing
of LPG;
(ii) Purchase, import, manufacture, sale, and maintenance of
appliances which use LPG or natural gas;
(iii)  Provision and sale of natural gas to industrial plants,
power stations and residential areas; and
(iv)  Entry into joint venture with any local or foreign entity
having similar objectives.
While the functions as enumerated in its charter of creation relate to every
aspect of gas distribution in Egypt, presently it is the intention of EGPC
that Petrogas, besides managing the distribution of LPG, focuses exclusively
on implementing the proposed gas distribution project. EGPC will, however, in
December 1980 review the organizational capacity of Petrogas for purposes of
determining the desirability of entrusting it with additional work of gas
distribution to power and industrial units in Cairo.



- 26 -
Capital Structure
3.04      The authorized capital of the company is LE30 million consisting
of six million shares. Of this, LE22.5 million is to be subscribed by EGPC
and the balance of LE7.5 million by COOP. One million shares, (LE5 million)
can be subscribed in cash and the balance of five million shares, (LE25
million) is to be subscribed in kind. COOP has subscribed fully its share of
LE7.5 million through asset transfer; EGPC has subscribed LE5.7 million, also
through asset transfer. Under the decree, Petrogas can call the balance
equity within five years by giving EGPC fifteen days notice. In order to meet
the financial needs of the project, Petrogas will revise appropriately the
limits on its capital as set above.
Organization
3.05      Petrogas, under its statutes, is to be run by a Board of Directors
consisting of a Chairman and eight members. The Chairman and four members
of the Board are appointed by the Prime Minister and the remaining four are
elected by the labour syndicate. In addition, the Prime Minister can appoint
two technical experts, but their intervention in the Board's deliberations
is limited to the area of their expertise. So far, only the Chairman has been
appointed and the powers of the Board of Directors are vested in him. The
Government of Egypt intends to nominate the Board of Directors over the next
year. As in other subsidiaries, the directors would be selected from the
senior managers and labour representatives working within Petrogas. The
holding company, (EGPC), would not be represented on the Board of Directors.
This reflects on the relative independence of the subsidiary in its day-to-day
operations. However, EGPC would closely monitor Petrogas' development during
the implementation period. Furthermore, EGPC reviews the company's performance
twice a year in the general body meeting. The general body also approves the
company's operating and capital budget.
Existing Operations
3.06      Petrogas' existing operations are confined almost exclusively to
transportation, distribution, and marketing of LPG. Imported LPG is trans-
ported in special tankers to Alexandria and Suez where it is pumped through
pipelines to storage facilities. From here, the LPG is transported by road
tankers and pipelines to four refilling plants at Mex, Moustorod, Tomuh, and
Suez. Indigenously produced LPG is similarly transported to the refilling
plants. There are presently in Egypt, 3.5 million LPG cylinders of 30 liters
capacity for domestic use and 200,000 cylinders of 90 liters capacity for
industrial use. Since domestic capacity for the fabrication of cylinders is
limited, (400,000 cylinders per annum), a fair proportion has to be imported.
After being refilled these cylinders are transported by road to 300 distribu-
tion centers in Egypt, of which 100 are located in Cairo, 30 in Alexandria,
and 170 in other areas of Egypt.
Project Management Needs
3.07      While Petrogas is a relatively new entity it has drawn upon the
competent and experienced personnel of EGPC and the subsidiaries of EGPC,
to man its senior levels. Most of the present managers in Petrogas have



- 27 -
extensive experience in the oil industry and are therefore capable of discharg-
ing their functions satisfactorily insofar as they relate to LPG operations.
The oil industry in Egypt, however, has had little experience in domestic
gas distribution. Petrogas, moreover, being a new entity, needs to create
an organization which, besides overseeing LPG operations, would be capable of
implementing the project and operating a safe gas utility.
3.08      Project implementation as currently designed takes note of these
limitations. Overall design specifications and network analysis was carried
out by Petrogas' consultants (British Gas), who have extensive experience in
this area. The task of implementation, (including detailed engineering, of
the distribution network, internal carcassing, and conversion) has been
entrusted to a contractor who has extensive experience in similar projects in
other countries. Initially, Petrogas will secure expatriate assistance for
supervising project implementation, (Para. 2.20 to 2.22).
3.09      Nonetheless, Petrogas' managerial and organizational capabilities
are critical to the successful implementation and operation of the project.
It would need to establish an organization capable of managing the contract,
ensuring extensive and effective supervision, and operating and maintaining a
safe and dependable supply of gas to its customers. During the preconstruction
stage, it would need to acquire rights of way, provide specific facilities for
the contractor, develop a manpower recruitment and training schedule and
create a corporate structure capable of managing the project and servicing
customers. During construction it would be called upon to approve detailed
engineering as carried out by the contractor, supervise construction, ensure
that work quality adheres to safety standards, record and keep all documents
relating to the project, such as "as-built" drawings, micro-films, etc. It
would also need to service the contract in terms of quality checks of material
used, material quantification, approval of bills, invoices, etc. Separately,
it would need to establish an operational organization to service customers,
undertake new extensions, establish emergency centers and handle emergency
calls. Petrogas would also be required to provide the necessary interface
between the contractor and other local bodies, launch extensive publicity
campaigns, etc.
Organization for Natural Gas Operations
3.10      The present organizational structure and staffing level is inade-
quate to meet the above requirements. During appraisal the organization
and staffing needs of Petrogas were considered at length. For satisfactory
implementation and management of the proposed project, an action plan is
required, firstly to strengthen the existing corporate structure, secondly,
to set up a construction management organization and finally, to establish
a gas operating organization.
(a)  Corporate Structure
The present structure of the company is geared to manage
LPG operations and would therefore need to be strengthened and
modified to take account of Petrogas' expanded responsibility of a
natural gas supplying utility. While common staff functions would
be performed by the director of finance, the director of personnel



- 28 -
and the legal counsel, LPG and natural gas operations would have to
be split and each operation would have to be headed by a General
Manager. Separately, a director for management information would
have to be appointed who would be responsible for data processing,
computer services and systems planning for the company. Because of
safety considerations the chairman would need to be assisted by a
safety adviser under whose aegis technical audits relating to safety
would be carried out. The organization chart relating to the
company and to the office of General Manager, Natural Gas Operations,
is given in ANNEX 3.01. This was reviewed and agreed upon during
appraisal and key personnel have been appointed.
(b) Project Construction Management
A Project Manager would be responsible for supervis-
ing project construction activities. He would be assisted by
three functional managers in charge of transmission, distribu-
tion, and customer services. These divisions would supervise
the contractor's work on the transmission pipeline, distribu-
tion network and carcassing and conversion. They would carry
out the necessary tests and ensure that the contractor adheres
to technical and safety specifications. In addition, the
Project Manager would be assisted by a finance manager respon-
sible for maintaining accounts and processing the bills, etc.,
relating to the contract. The organization chart of project
management and the number of personnel required is in ANNEX
3.02. A Project Manager has been appointed. During appraisal,
agreement was also reached on the number and categories of
construction management staff which would be recruited. Pursuant
to this agreement, seventy-two field level supervisors have been
recruited.
(c) Natural Gas Operations
It is expected that the first set of consumers
would be converted to natural gas by the end of 1980. Petrogas
would need to organize itself beforehand, so that it can
discharge all the functions of a gas utility. For this purpose
a separate department for natural gas operations would have
to be established under an Operations Manager who would be
assisted by a Central Manager and four Regional Managers for
Helwan, Maadi, Nasr City and Heliopolis. The Central Manager
would provide centralized services to the regions including
technical services, (vehicles, stores, etc.), operating services,
(cathodic protection, odorizing, communications, etc.), gas
control and accounting (control stations, gas balancing, gas
contracts), etc. The Area Managers for each of the four
districts would oversee gas operations in those districts
and provide all operation and maintenance services, customer
services, construction of new service lines and hookups,
emergency services, etc. In addition, Area Managers would
be responsible for sales, meter reading, and billing. The
organizational chart for the natural gas operations is in
ANNEX 3.03.



- 29 -
Agreement was reached with Petrogas on the overall organizational structure
as delineated above and as shown in ANNEX 3.01, 3.02 and 3.03. Detailed job
specifications and recruitment schedules have been worked out by Petrogas,
with the assistance of its consultants. While key personnel have been
appointed, Petrogas has agreed to fully staff the organization by December 31,
1980.
Training
3.11      As indicated above, little or no experience exists in Egypt in
regard to the construction of a gas distribution network and operation of a
gas utility. Petrogas would have to design and implement an extensive train-
ing program for various categories of personnel. Training programs would have
to be drawn up, trainers identified and trained, and all facilities, tools and
equipment needed for this purpose, acquired. Training is essential not only
to ensure adequate supervision of the contractor, but also to create a corps
of trained manpower which can rapidly replace the expatriate workforce. To
ensure that the necessary transfer of skills and technology is effected, it
would be necessary for Petrogas and Petrojet (a construction and contracting
subsidiary of EGPC), to depute their personnel to the contractor. The con-
tractor would provide the requisite training and thereafter utilize these
personnel in project construction. Petrogas and Petrojet are currently nego-
tiating such an arrangement with the contractor. British Gas is separately
assessing in detail the overall training requirements including the establish-
ment of a permanent training institute. The proposed credit would adequately
finance the training requirements. Petrogas agreed to (i) prepare by
December 31, 1980, with the assistance of its consultants, a detailed assess-
ment of the overall training requirements of its personnel, (ii) submit to
the Association by March 31, 1981 a detailed training program for its review
and implement the agreed upon training program thereafter. Furthermore,
Petrogas agreed to enter into a satisfactory agreement with the contractor by
December 31, 1980, to train Petrogas personnel.
Accounts and Audit
3.12      Petrogas is obligated by law to prepare full accounts of its finan-
cial position and of its annual operations, by the end of every year . These
accounts are subject to an external audit by the Egyptian "Central Accounting
Authority," and to the approval of the general meeting of stockholders held
regularly within six months after the end of the year. Like all other public
sector companies, Petrogas follows the "Unified Accounting System" established
by a Presidential Decree in 1966. In addition, the Company must follow
specialized subsystems of cost accounting and reporting developed by EGPC,
in conformance with the Unified System, for use by all its petroleum sector
subsidiaries. A general review of the accounting practices of EGPC will be
carried out (as part of a study financed through Bank Loan 1732-EGT) by finan-
cial consultants to be appointed by EGPC in May 1980. EGPC has agreed through
Loan 1732-EGT to consult with the Bank on the findings of the diagnostic study
and to commence the implementation of a plan of action for itself and its
subsidiaries by July 31, 1980.
3.13      In addition, in order to provide for an efficient follow up of
project development, an information system should be established for the



- 30 -
natural gas operations of Petrogas, which would lead to separate accounts for
those operations. Petrogas has agreed to employ EGPC's consultants to (i)
assist it in the design and implementation of an information system which
would permit segregation of accounts pertaining to natural gas operations and
accounts related to LPG operations; (ii) help it to implement the cost account-
ing and cost control systems to be developed under the contract with EGPC, and
(iii) review internal control for its overall operations, and develop recom-
mendations for improvements. The consultant's recommendations will be reviewed
by December 31, 1980.
3.14      Having been instituted as a new company towards the end of 1978,
Petrogas' first set of complete accounts will, as an exception, not be due
before January 1980. Due to delays in the transfer of certain aspects of LPG
operations from COOP to Petrogas, the company's accounts of its position since
September 1, 1978, are at present still provisional and incomplete. Petrogas
has agreed to submit to IDA, not later than September 30, 1980, a complete set
of auditor's approved accounts of its position and operations covering the
first sixteen months of operation between September 1, 1978 and December 31,
1979. During negotiations, Petrogas furthermore agreed to have the project
accounts and its other accounts and financial statements independently audited,
and to supply IDA with copies of such statements no later than nine months
after the end of every year.
Insurance
3.15      Petrogas covers all of its major facilities and equipment against
fire, blowups, damage, and theft through comprehensive insurance schemes.
The company has, in particular, extensive agreements to protect it against
a variety of risks involved in the transportation, bottling, and delivery
of LPG. Petrogas will enter into specific insurance agreements for its
natural gas operations, including third party liability. Petrogas is covered
by insurance policies with the three major public sector insurance companies
within Egypt, (Misr, Ashark, and Al Ahliah Insurance), who are in turn re-
insured outside the country.
IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Introduction
4.01      Although Petrogas' activities as of its date of incorporation
(September 1, 1978) were exclusively LPG distribution, the emphasis of its
responsibilities will progressively shift towards domestic gas distribution
with the implementation of this project, as well as with the future development
of other gas distribution projects in Cairo or in Alexandria. While sales of
LPG and natural gas serve a similar purpose (provision of energy to domestic
users), the financial and managerial characteristics of both operations are
bound to be very different. LPG incremental investments are directly linked
to demand and are relatively inexpensive, but the cost of this imported energy



- 31 -
is high. Gas operations are highly capital intensive with large initial
investments and low incremental expenditures as consumption develops, but cost
of the gas, an indigenous commodity, is low. For social and political reasons,
it is difficult for the government to set prices of fuels for domestic use
(LPG and kerosene) at a level which would fairly represent the economic cost
of importing and distributing these energies. In contrast, it appears pos-
sible to reflect opportunity costs and aim for independent financial viability
on gas operations. These major differences call for different financial
objectives as well as separate follow-up and accounting systems.
LPG Operations
4.02      A summary and brief explanation of Petrogas LPG operations is given
in ANNEX 4.01. Petrogas net fixed assets were LE13.3 million as of September
1, 1978. They consisted essentially of LPG cylinders, vehicles, filling
plants and storage facilities. Petrogas' current assets were LE6.2 million
which were mainly LPG stocks and spare parts, (LE4.1 million) and receivables,
(LE1.8 million). Current liabilities were LE6.3 million, of which 44% related
to payments due to EGPC for LPG supplies. Petrogas had no long-term debt and
its equity was LE13.2 million. The level of paid-in capital will need to be
revised (see para. 3.04). This revision will take into account the investment
plan for LPG activities shown in ANNEX 4.01; LPG funding requirements are at
present estimated at LE34 million for the period FY80 through FY85.
4.03      LPG activities of Petrogas are quite typical of the arrangements for
marketing subsidiaries in the oil sector in Egypt. Petrogas purchases LPG at
a highly subsidized price from EGPC (LE24 per ton as compared to current
border price of over LE300 per ton) and resells it at the domestic price,
(LE52 per ton). The difference (or 'commission') was set in such a way as
to cover operating, storage, distribution costs, etc., as well as a budgeted
margin of about 12.5% of selling price. This system permits financial
viability of Petrogas' LPG activities, independent of the actual economic
cost of the energy.
4.04      Since November 1973, there has been no increase in the selling
price of LPG to the public, nor review of purchasing price from EGPC; as LPG
operating costs have increased sensibly with domestic and international
inflation, margins have shrunk from LE6.5 per ton in 1973 to LE4.8 per ton
in 1978. EGPC has therefore agreed to maintain at all times Petrogas'
commission on LPG distribution at a level sufficient to cover for Petrogas all
LPG operating costs.
Natural Gas Operations
4.05      Because of the fundamental differences between LPG and natural gas
operations (para. 4.01), Petrogas has agreed to have separate accounting and
financial follow up to its new natural gas operations. Prices for natural gas
sales would be set at a level which would enable revenues to cover related
operating expenses, generate enough cash internally to adequately ensure debt
servicing, and finance the greater part of Petrogas' future expansion in the
project areas (see para. 4.12).



- 32 -
Provision of Fixed Assets
4.06      In its natural gas operations, Petrogas will provide all fixed
assets up to the property line (transmission pipeline, gas regulating stations,
distribution system, service lines and gas meters). While Petrogas will be
responsible for the supervising and commissioning of internal carcassing in
all the existing 160,000 apartments, and for the conversion of about 300,000
existing appliances from LPG to natural gas envisaged under the Project, the
Government/EGPC will finance the costs of the respective investments, which
are presently estimated at LE200 per household. During negotiations, the
Government and EGPC agreed to make enough funds (both in foreign exchange and
local currencies) available to provide for the timely completion of this
work.
4.07      The Government took the decision to finance the costs of carcassing
and appliance conversion for the following reasons: (i) consumers in existing
households would be unwilling/unable to bear the full cost of carcassing and
conversion; such a charge would be very large in relation to domestic fuel
bills and incomes and would not be warranted by their marginal preference for
gas over LPG; (ii) if the costs were met through the gas tariff the price to
consumers to achieve viable natural gas operations would have to be set at a
level (LE4/Mcf) which would impose too heavy a burden on low income consumers
and might encourage shifts to low priced, but high value substitutes, such as
LPG or kerosene, thus defeating the government's policy to encourage the sub-
stitution of more economic fuels. In addition, such a method of cost recovery
would also be inequitable since it would require all consumers to pay for part
of the cost of the carcassing undertaken for the initial 160,000 consumers.
4.08      There would remain, however, some avenues for the Government to
recover, at least partially, the initial costs of carcassing and conversion
from consumers, without jeopardizing their willingness to convert to gas.
Consumers would be asked to trade in their bottles of LPG in exchange for
conversion. Since Petrogas could use these bottles for its LPG operations,
this could provide LE9 million, or about 25% of the total cost of carcassing
and conversion. Another possibility is to have the consumer bear the cost of
service lines or carcassing where it exceeds a certain stipulated length.
These and other possible avenues would be considered in a short study to be
undertaken by EGPC and Petrogas, with the help of consultants (see para.
4.16).
4.09      On completion of the project, Petrogas' capital assets for natural
gas operations, (LE65.4 million) will consist of: (i) the high transmission
pipeline (LE14.4 million); (ii) the odorizing unit (LEO.3 million); (iii) the
pressure regulating stations (LEI.5 million); (iv) the distribution network
including mains (LE14.8 million), service lines (LE4.6 million), regulators
(LE3.6 million) and infill (LE1.6 million); (v) gas meters (LE8.5 million);
(vi) training (LE1.5 million); (vii) consultancy (LE3.5 million); and (viii)
related price and physical contingency (LEl1.1 million). Capital assets will
be depreciated according to a schedule consistent with the Unified Accounting
System. An assumption of a 5% depreciation rate has been used in the financial
forecasts. This is conservative, in view of the projected life of the assets.



- 33 -
For the purposes of computing rates of return on assets (para. 4.12) Petrogas
agreed to revalue its gas related capital assets, depreciation charge and
accumulated depreciation each year, according to a method acceptable to IDA.
During negotiations, it was agreed that this revaluation will be achieved
by using the index published by the United Nations for the prices of machinery
and equipment exported by developed countries. In the financial projections,
a revaluation rate of 10% a year has been assumed.
Purchase of Gas
4.10      Petrogas will purchase its natural gas supplies from EGPC.  EGPC
and Petrogas have agreed to enter by December 31, 1980 into an agreement
whereby EGPC would supply Petrogas with the quantities of gas required to
service the two power stations and the domestic/commercial consumers connected
to the distribution system, at a price which would not be less, in terms of
BTU, than the domestic price of fuel oil supplied to power stations. Based on
the present domestic price for fuel oil, a transfer price for gas of LEO.19
per Mcf, increasing by 10% a year, has been assumed in the financial projec-
tions.
Sale of Gas
4.11      Petrogas' natural gas revenues will be obtained from the sale of
gas to two power stations along the pipeline route and to private consumers
in four districts of Cairo (see paras. 2.06 to 2.10). The power stations will
be the major customer in the initial years, with an expected combined consump-
tion of 2.2 billion cu.ft. in FY (Fiscal Year) 80, and 4.4 billion cu.ft. in
FYs81 through 86; these gas turbine power stations are being established to
function as base load stations up to 1986. However, once major steam turbine
units come into service in Suez and Cairo, tlle units would work only for 2000
hrs/year for meeting peak requirements. It is expected that their demand for
gas would thereafter fall to 2.2 billion cu.ft. per yeai. Private consumption
will increase in correlation with the number of houses connected. The overall
growth of gas consumption is expected as follows (see para. 2.21).

Pricing Policy
4.12      Pricing of natural gas sales to consumers should (i) ensure that
over the longer term, operating revenues cover operating expenses, debt
service, and provide a reasonable contribution to the future expansion of
natural gas facilities; and (ii) price gas higher than its opportunity cost
(i.e. fuel oil, f.o.b. price). It is realized that because of the necessary
time lag in connecting sizeable numbers of consumers, Petrogas will require a
number of years before it can earn a reasonable rate of return on its net
fixed assets, to achieve the objectives set above. On the basis of present
forecasts it would be reasonable to request Petrogas to earn 9% on its net
revalued natural gas fixed assets only after 1990. In the meantime it is
proposed to request Petrogas to meet the undermentioned financial targets:
from FY 80 through FY 83, revenues should be sufficient to cover at least
operating expenses (excluding depreciation), debt service, and working capital
needs. Thereafter, Petrogas should achieve the following rates of return on
revalued net assets:
FYs 84/85      FYs 86/87      FYs 88/89      FY 90      FY 91 and thereafter
3%             4%             5%          7%        not less than 9%
During negotiations the Government and Petrogas agreed to these targets.
4.13      Different sets of policies could be chosen at this stage in order
to meet the financial objectives: (i) decrease the price of natural gas below
its present level in order to stimulate consumption and therefore aim for
financial viability through increased volume of sales, or (ii) set the price
at a higher level, taking into account the risk of substitution of other
fuels, and the effect on per capita consumption level. The first alternative
has been adopted in many developed countries such as France, the U.K., and the
Netherlands, in the 1950s-60s when natural gas distribution was substituted
for town gas. In the context of Egypt, it is preferred to follow the increased
price alternative for the following reasons: (i) this price ensures that
economic pricing will be met; (ii) it encourages conservation of domestic
fuels; and (iii) the risk of substitution of other fuels and/or decrease in
consumption appears to be limited at present. These risks are addressed in
detail in para. 5.16.
4.14      Because of the social problems involved in the supply of domestic
fuels, the Government is of the view that the price of gas to domestic con-
sumers should remain constant during the first five years of operation.
Current forecasts indicate that to meet the objectives of viability set
above, the average price to domestic consumers would have to be set initially
at LE3 per Mcf. During negotiations the Government/EGPC confirmed that the
average price of gas would at no time be less than that level. Further-
more, during negotiations, the Government and Petrogas agreed to submit every
year, starting in March 1983, financial projections showing that the tariff,
appropriately revised, meets the objectives of financial viability set in
para. 4.12. It is expected that in the initial period (FY80 through FY84),
there would be no need for revision of the initially agreed price, unless the



- 35 -
conditions (price escalation, number of connections achieved, etc.) were to
differ from present assumptions.
4.15      It is anticipated that an average revenue of LE3 per Mcf would
provide sufficient income to cover operating expenses and debt service re-
quirements, during the period FY80 through FY84. It is also projected that
the proposed tariff would enable Petrogas to meet its capital expenditure
requirements for the program from its internally generated funds from gas
operations after 1983. The DCF internal rate of return would be 20.6% in
current terms (i.e. about 11% in real terms) over the life of the project.
Projections assume that Petrogas' average earnings from gas sales to private
consumers would be LE3 per Mcf between 1980-85, and would increase at a rate
of 10% a year afterwards.
4.16      Setting the price for domestic users at the proposed level would
represent a major increase above the current price of LPG (an effective
doubling), and could impose undue hardship on poorer consumers. To make
the increased cost burden more equitable, Government has agreed to consider
the possibility of setting a graduated tariff structure which would still
secure Petrogas the average revenue indicated above while increasing only
slightly the average domestic fuel bill of the poorer consumer. EGPC and
Petrogas have agreed to undertake a tariff study to evolve such a graduated
structure. This study should be finalized and submitted to the Association
for review before December 31, 1980. Petrogas and the Government have also
concurred that the agreed tariff will be implemented in time to match the
first supply to consumers.
4.17      The gas to be supplied to power stations will be sold at, at least,
LEO.51 per Mcf. This price represents a sizeable increase over the LEO.19 per
Mcf charged until recently to all power stations. Under Loan 1732-EGT, Govern-
ment has agreed to revise energy prices in Egypt as a result of the Products
Pricing and Gas Utilization studies which are now being undertaken, and which
should be finalized by January 1981. Projections assume a price of gas to
power stations of LEO.51 per Mcf in 1980, increasing by 10% a year thereafter.
4.18      The proposed financial arrangement would ensure that Petrogas
functions as a non-subsidized public utility for its gas operations incurring
all actual costs involved in the process of gas distribution, while still
achieving an adequate return. It represents a significant change in policy
when compared with the commission system presently existing for Petrogas' LPG
operations and EGPC's marketing subsidiaries (see para. 4.03).

Petrogas in excess of its net internal cash generation and long term debt
drawdowns. An assurance from Government, and EGPC that they will provide
Petrogas with the required funds, as and when needed, has been obtained during
negotiations. EGPC is expected to contribute about LE24 million toward the
project in the first four years.

4.22      Using as a basis for the forecasts the pricing set in paragraph
4.10, (for purchase of gas) and paragraph 4.11 (for sale of gas), the following
comments can be made: (i) Return on revalued net assets is projected at about
6% in FY85, progressing to 10% in FY90. The conservative level of these returns
is due to the fact that gas distribution system will be fully operational only
after 26 years, once all 640,000 households are connected and, by the end of
the disbursement period of the proposed IDA credit (1983), only 30% of the
total projected connections will have been achieved. (ii) Net income would
increase from LE419 thousand in FY81 to LE5.5 million in FY86; however, owing
to the heavy interest charges, annual net losses would be incurred until FY84;
these should be eliminated by FY86 from net profits. (iii) The current ratio
is expected to be satisfactory throughout the projected period. Nevertheless
if, during the initial stage, internal cash generation were insufficient to
cover debt service and working capital needs, EGPC would provide the necessary
deficiency contribution. This has been confirmed during negotiations. (iv)
Debt/equity ratio is expected to improve from 59/41 in FY80 to 37/63 in FY86.
Debt service coverage should increase from 1.3 times in FY80 to 1.7 times in
FY85, with higher coverages after FY87. During negotiations Petrogas agreed
not to incur long term debt for its natural gas operations, without consulting
IDA, unless its future debt service for these operations is (i) for each of
the years 1981 and 1982 covered 1 times, and (ii) for each year thereafter
covered 1.5 times, by a reasonable forecast of net natural gas income in such
year, before charging depreciation.
4.23      Petrogas is required to set aside reserves as prescribed by law,
and in its charter of incorporation, in the following pattern: 2% of net
income is invested in Nasr Bank shares; 5% of profit is allocated to cons-
titute legal reserves; 5% of profit is used to buy government bonds or to
be deposited in a special account at the Central Bank; and 5% contributes
to the inflation reserves. After the appropriation to reserves, the rest of
the net income is distributed as follows: 5% of paid capital is contributed
to shareholders and employees; 10% of the remaining amount is EGPC's manage-
ment fee; and the rest is either distributed to shareholders and employees, or
set aside as reserves, according to the decision of the General Assembly of
Shareholders. Since Petrogas' natural gas operations are expected, under
depreciation assumptions, to have accumulated net losses until FY85, these
provisions will only become effective in FY86. Despite these distribution
arrangements, forecast indicates that net internal cash generation will be
sufficient to cover expansion program requirements after 1983. Nevertheless,
an assurance from the Government and EGPC that they will provide Petrogas
with any funds required to carry on its expansion has been obtained during
negotiations.

Results indicate that (i) financial viability is very sensitive to pricing
policies, both to power station, (Case 1) and to domestic consumers, (Cases 2
and 3). These results underline the need for close monitoring of pricing
issues during project implementation and a thorough supervision in order
to ensure that Petrogas' financial objectives are met; (ii) should only 90%,
or even 80%, of the scheduled connections be achieved each year, (Cases 5 and
6) the financial results would be lower, but still acceptable. Similarly,
should there be a drop of consumption to 90% of estimated level, (Case 4) the
financial viability would not be dramatically impaired; and (iii) 20% overruns
on the total project cost would bring DCF internal rate of return to 8.2%
and rate of return on revalued net assets in 1990 to 7.2%, (Case 8). However,
financial viability is rather insensitive to cost overruns on fixed assets
acquired after 1983.
V.  ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
5.01      The project's primary justification is the savings which accrue
to the Government of Egypt by upgrading the use of its natural gas from a
replacement for fuel oil to a substitute for gas oil and LPG. The project
is the least cost method of meeting domestic energy demand in the project
area and makes optimal use of Abu Ghardig gas. Natural gas prices will be
increased significantly under the project, and a progressive tariff structure
will be instituted to shield small consumers from international energy prices
for their basic cooking needs, while encouraging larger users to conserve
energy. The project has been designed to result in a significant transfer of
technology and skills to Petrogas, which will enable it to expand domestic gas
distribution in Cairo and other areas, in the future, with minimal expatriate
input.



- 39
Least Cost Solution
5.02      There are three steps to the least cost evaluation of this project.
The first is to determine that natural gas is the least cost alternative for
meeting demand in the project area. The second is to ensure that the project
represents the optimal use of Abu Ghardig gas and, finally, that the project
itself is the least cost design configuration.
5.03      The alternative to natural gas for the two gas turbines in the
project area is gas oil, which they would otherwise have to use. The BTU
equivalent border price of gas oil (at $320/ton) is about $7.6/mcf, compared
with an average incremental cost of natural gas delivered by the project of
less than $2.9/mcf for the power station component. To better assess domestic
demand in the project area, a survey was undertaken by Petrogas of five per-
cent of the households in the four areas. It was found that LPG is currently
used for cooking in all of the houses, for water heating in about 35% of the
houses, and for space heating in 3%. All houses use electricity for lighting
(with 10 ampere connections), but only one percent has electric stoves. In
the poorer areas, some consumers have a kerosene burner which is used to heat
water. The primary domestic alternatives to natural gas, therefore, are (i)
continued use of LPG, (ii) replacement by kerosene, and (iii) upgrading
electricity supplies to allow electric stoves and water heaters.
5.04      Replacing LPG with kerosene would merely be substituting one expen-
sive, internationally tradeable commodity for another. Both are high value
petroleum products, although the storage problems of LPG in Egypt (necessita-
ting smaller purchase lots) mean that kerosene's delivered cost to the consumer
is marginally lower than that of LPG. A direct BTU-equivalent comparison
between the two is not valid, however, due to the clear quality advantage of
LPG in meeting consumer needs (para. 5.17).
5.05      The possibility of upgrading existing electricity supplies to
satisfy cooking and water heating requirements was also considered, although
on energy conservation grounds it is unlikely that burning fuel to produce
power would be economical compared with direct fuel use by consumers. Indeed,
the additional fuel cost alone required to produce the incremental power
equivalent of the gas consumption, over the life of the project, would have a
total present value cost of LE280 million, or more than double the total domestic
gas distribution costs of the proposed project. In addition, the electricity
alternative would require investment in generation facilities, upgrading of
the distribution system and house connections and the replacement of existing
stoves and heaters by electric appliances (which are not locally manufactured
at present). Therefore, the LPG and gas oil alternatives are used as the
basis of comparison in the rate of return analysis.
5.06      The major alternative use of natural gas in Egypt is as a fuel oil
replacement in Cairo. Higher grade uses, such as feedstock, are not currently
available in the area. Under the Gulf of Suez loan to Egypt, financing was
included for a study of the optimal utilization of Egypt's natural gas re-
sources. Given existing pipeline infrastructure and the current and projected
international prices for LPG versus fuel oil (para. 5.09), the proposed



- 40 -
project represents the optimal use of the Abu Ghardig gas. Its net present
value exceeds that of the next best alternative (fuel oil replacement in
Cairo) by LE130 million at a 12% discount rate.
5.07      The third stage of the least cost analysis is the design of the
project itself. As discussed in para. 2.11, the original project design was
completely revised following Bank review, and the current project configura-
tion resulted from a detailed computer simulation of design alternatives.
Return on Investment
5.08      The project's return on investment has been calculated through a
comparison of the costs and benefits of the project with those which would
be incurred without the project. The without project alternative in this
case is to continue using LPG to meet domestic demands in the project area,
to use gas oil in the gas turbines at Nasr City and Heliopolis, and to use
the natural gas in Cairo as a substitute for fuel oil. These alternatives
are summarized below.
Domestic      Gas Turbine          Non-project areas
Consumers         Plants               in Cairo
Without project      LPG            Gas oil             Natural gas
With Project       Natural Gas    Natural Gas           Fuel oil
The LPG and, in all probability, gas oil would have to be imported. The fuel
oil is available locally and could otherwise be exported. Thus the border
consequences of the project would be to reduce LPG and gas oil import require-
ments and to reduce the amount of fuel oil which could be exported. Project
benefits, in effect, are represented by the differential between the border
prices of imported LPG and gas oil (c.i.f.) and the border price of fuel oil
(f.o.b.) which is otherwise released for export.
5.09      Prior to the current round of escalations, prices of petroleum products
maintained a relatively stable relationship with the price of crude oil. Gas oil
and LPG were priced at about 120% and 115% respectively, of the price of Arabian
light crude oil, while fuel oil prices were about 75% of the crude price. On
this basis, and pricing oil at US$33/barrel, international prices of LPG, gas
oil and fuel oil would be US$275, US$290 and US$150 per ton, respectively.
Freight charges for LPG and gas oil are estimated as US$75 and US$30 per ton,
respectively. Recent disruptions in oil supplies have tended to increase both
the international price differential and the freight charges which are appli-
cable to LPG and gas oil. For the purpose of the base case analysis, however,
the prices of LPG (c.i.f.), gas oil (c.i.f.), and fuel oil (f.o.b.), have been
taken as US$350, US$320 and US$150 per ton.
5.10      Project costs at constant (1980) prices, excluding taxes and sub-
sidies, and including the incremental carcassing costs of future new houses
have been used. The foreign exchange component has been converted to border
prices at the exchange rate of US$1.44/LE and labor costs have been valued at
market prices. The LPG/gas oil alternative includes all incremental costs
associated with continued production and distribution.



- 41 -
5.11     On this basis the internal rate of return on the project is 44%.  The
return on the component which supplies gas to the two gas turbine plants (if
implemented alone with a smaller transmission pipeline) would be over 100%,
and the incremental return on the domestic gas distribution component is
23%. The latter adds LE55 million in net present value to the project.
5.12      The major uncertainties of the project are the timing of the car-
cassing and conversion activities needed to connect domestic consumers and
the potential for marginal fuel substitution once increased natural gas
prices are implemented. If only 60% of projected consumption were to take
place each year due to delays in connections and/or LPG/kerosene substitution,
the project's rate of return would be reduced to 40% (and that of the domestic
distribution component to 17%). If project costs were to increase by 30%,
the total project return would fall to 29%. If currently prevailing gas
oil/LPG/fuel oil price differentials were to continue over the project life-
time, the return would increase to 67%.
Pricing
5.13      As shown below, Egypt's regime of administered prices has resulted
in domestic petroleum product prices which, except for gasoline, are less
than one fourth of their border equivalents (para 1.25). By maintaining
prices at this level a valuable opportunity for increasing domestic resource
mobilization is being lost.

policy, the Bank's previous loan in this sector included financing for a
comprehensive study of alternative price scenarios and their effects upon
energy consumers. The study is expected to be completed by January 1981.
Pending that detailed review, this project will succeed in raising natural gas
prices to domestic consumers to an average level of LE3/mcf, which is above
the border price of gas' current opportunity cost as a fuel oil replacement
(about LE2.6/mcf). By comparison, the average incremental cost of gas produced
and distributed by the project is about LE2/mcf, at a discount rate of 12%,
and the equivalent border price of LPG is about LE5/mcf.
5.14      To avoid imposing hardship on the poorer project area residents who
use gas only for cooking, a progressive tariff structure will be agreed upon
whereby the minimal requirements for cooking will be sold at a reduced rate



- 42 -
(para. 4.16). This will also minimize any incentive for the poor to switch
from gas to low priced, but high value, kerosene (para. 5.17). A short tariff
study will be conducted to determine the appropriate blocks in the tariff
structure, but it is expected that consumption in excess of about 1,000 cf/
month will be charged at a rate which exceeds the border price of natural gas'
current opportunity cost as a fuel oil replacement.
5.15      The price of natural gas sold to power stations to be supplied by
the project will be set at, at least, LEO.51/Mcf (para. 4.17). The Egyptians
covenanted under the first loan to address the question of natural gas prices
to the power and industrial sectors through the pricing study discussed above,
in order to work toward a broader solution to energy sector pricing.
Fuel Substitution Risks
5.16      As noted in para. 5.12 a possible economic risk of the project is
the possibility of fuel substitution by domestic consumers. The table below
shows the current BTU equivalent prices of kerosene, LPG and electricity
compared with the proposed natural gas price.
LE/mcf
Fuel                                 equivalent 1/
Kerosene                                 0.88

Electricity 3/                           5.90
Natural gas                              3.00
While it is expected that the energy pricing study financed under the previous
loan to EGPC will recommend an increase in kerosene and LPG prices, it cannot
be assumed that such recommendations will be implemented by the time this
project is completed. Therefore, in addition to continuing discussions with
the Government on the general issue of energy pricing, the mission carefully
examined the potential for fuel substitution and reviewed its possible effect
on project benefits.
5.17      The project rate of return is rather insensitive to marginal switch-
ing fom natural gas to kerosene or LPG. With respect to kerosene, there are
several reasons why no more than marginal substitution is expected to take
place. Its odor and safety problems limit its current and future use to the
lowest income areas. In those areas, however, 70 percent of the households
use only one bottle of LPG (LEO.56/mcf equivalent) per month. The progressive
tariff structure with its lifeline rate for small users will minimize any
substitution incentive for them. In the more affluent areas, electricity and
LPG are the relevant candidates for natural gas substitution. In Maadi, for
1/ Does not take into account differing appliance efficiencies.
2/ The black market price for LPG is about LE1.5 per bottle which is equivalent
to about LE2.7/mcf.
3/ Effective January 1980 for consumers using less than 100 kWh/month.



- 43 -
example, 73% of the households consume more than one bottle of LPG per month,
and 39% consume 3 or more bottles. For them, the proposed gas price is likely
to represent a significant increase even over present black market prices, so
there may be an incentive to switch back to LPG or to electricity. The risk
of substantial switching back to LPG is limited because (i) the Government
will close LPG distribution centers in the project area so that sizeable
transportation costs would be involved; (ii) the initial houses connected to
the distribution system will have to trade in the LPG cylinders in order to be
converted free of charge to natural gas; (iii) switching back to LPG would
require either re-conversion or replacement of appliances, which would re-
present high initial costs; (iv) natural gas has advantages over LPG in terms
of safety and supply which will be advertised and appreciated by such con-
sumers; and (v) the black market price of LPG is likely to increase as supplies
become tighter. With respect to electricity even higher front-end costs are
involved as all electric stoves have to be imported. In addition, the present
power tariff of LE.02/kWh is significantly above the natural gas equivalent
price, even allowing for possible efficiency advantages of electric appliances.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations the following issues were raised with EGPC and
Petrogas and satisfactory assurances were obtained that:
(i) EGPC would operate gas fields at Abu Ghardig or other gas fields
subsequently discovered and linked with Cairo, in a manner which
would permit availability of the gas for the Cairo gas distribution
network over a period of at least 16 years after project completion
(paragraph 2.05);
(ii) Petrogas would continue to employ experienced consultants on terms
and conditions satisfactory to IDA, (paragraph 2.20);
(iii) Petrogas, with the assistance of its consultants, would by
December 31, 1980 compile a detailed code for supervisory and safety
tests. Measures in this respect would be reviewed and agreed upon
with IDA, (paragraph 2.28);
(iv) Petrogas would periodically submit project progress reports to
IDA, (paragraph 2.31);
(v) Petrogas would fully staff its agreed organizational structure
by December 31, 1980 (paragraph 3.10);
(vi) Petrogas would prepare by December 31, 1980 a detailed assessment
of training requirements of its personnel. Petrogas would further
present a complete training program to the Association, for review
not later than March 31, 1981. It would also, by December 31, 1980,
enter into a satisfactory training agreement with the contractor
for the training of Petrojet and its personnel (para. 3.11);



- 44 -
(vii)  Petrogas would establish separate accounts for natural gas opera-
tions. It would, further, employ consultants satisfactory to the
Association for assisting it, (a) in designing and implementing an
information system which would permit segregation of accounts; (b)
in implementing cost accounting and cost control systems; and (c) in
reviewing internal control for its overall operations, (paragraph
3.13);
(viii)  Petrogas would submit to IDA project accounts and other accounts,
duly audited by independent auditors, not later than nine months
after the end of each year, (paragraph 3.14);
(x) EGPC would review each year the commission on LPG distribution
so as to ensure that it is sufficient to cover all LPG operating
costs, (paragraph 4.04);
(xi) Petrogas and EGPC would commission a study in order to evolve a
graduated tariff structure and consider the possibilities of
recovering, at least partially, the carcassing and conversion costs
from the initial 160,000 consumers. This study should be finalized
and submitted to the Association for review before December 31,
1980, (paragraph 4.08 and 4.16);
(xii) Petrogas and EGPC would enter into an agreement which would ensure
an adequate supply of gas to the project. The price would not be
less, in terms of BTU, than the domestic price of fuel oil supplied
to power stations (paragraph 4.10);
(xiii) Petrogas would from time to time set the average price of natural
gas supplied to domestic consumers and the power stations to meet
the following targets: in FY 80 through FY 83, revenues should be
sufficient to cover at least operating expenses (excluding deprecia-
tion), debt service and working capital needs; in FYs 84 and 85,
Petrogas should achieve a 3% rate of return on revalued net
assets, increasing to 4% in FYs 86 and 87, 5% in FYs 88 and 89,
7% in FY 90, and 9% in FY 91 and thereafter, it being understood
that the average price to domestic consumers and the price to
power stations shall at no time be less than LE3 per Mcf and
LEO.51 per Mcf, respectively (paragraphs 4.12, 4.14 and 4.17);
(xiv) Petrogas would not incur any long term debt for its natural gas
operations without consulting with IDA, unless future debt service
for natural gas operations is covered (a) for each of the years
1981 and 1982 1 times, and (b) for each year thereafter 1.5 times,
by a reasonable forecast of net natural gas income in such year
before charging depreciation (paragraph 4.22);
6.02      Assurances were obtained during negotiations from ARE and EGPC on
the following:



- 45 -
(i) ARE would by June 30, 1981 carry out a study to review the economic
viability of rehabilitating and converting the existing gas distribu-
tion network in central Cairo from producer gas to natural gas
and linking it with the proposed project, and would implement any
recommendations mutually agreed with IDA (paragraph 2.02);
(ii) ARE would issue a decree prior to December 31, 1980 in relation to
the buildings to be constructed in the project area, which obligates
the builder to make necessary provisions for internal carcassing and
external piping up to the periphery of the property line, under the
overall supervision of Petrogas, (paragraph 2.12);
(iii) ARE would finance, in conjunction with EGPC, the cost of internal
carcassing of the existing 160,000 apartments and conversion of
about 300,000 appliances, (paragraph 4.06); and
(iv) ARE would in conjunction with EGPC provide Petrogas with the funds
required to meet capital expenditure needs during project construc-
tion, to carry on its expansion, and to cover any deficiencies in
debt servicing and working capital during initial stages of project
operation, (paragraphs 4.22 and 4.23).
6.03      Based on the above assurances, the project is suitable for an IDA
credit of US$50 million.

Sale of LPG
The financial arrangements on LPG sales are typical of existing
arrangements for all EGPC marketing subsidiaries. For all these subsidiaries
a products transfer price from EGPC is set in such a way as to ensure that the
difference between the selling price of the public and the purchasing price
from EGPC covers the cost of marketing plus an adequate margin. Petrogas
purchases LPG from EGPC at LE24 per ton and sells it at LE52 per ton to
domestic consumers. The differential (or "commission") has remained the
same since 1965, when it was set to cover expected distribution costs, sales
taxes, and a budgeted margin at LE6.5 per ton.



- 57 -                       ANNEX 4.01
Page 2
Because of increased costs the realized profit margin on LPG sales
declined between 1965 and 1975 to LE4.5 per ton in 1975. It continued to
erode in the last three years from a level of LE7.1 per ton in 1976, to
LE5.7 per ton in 1977, to LE4.6 per ton in 1978, despite EGPC's having
assumed payment of the sales tax on behalf of its subsidiary throughout
this three year period. As a result, despite a growth in LPG sales from
about 210 thousand tons in 1976, to 250 thousand tons in 1977, to 300
thousand tons in 1978, the total net annual profit earned on LPG sales has
remained nearly unchanged at about LE1.4-1.5 million (or 89% of total net
profit) for each of the three past years. Assurances would be obtained at
negotiations that the Government would review annually the commission on
LPG distribution (para. 4.04).
Sales of Appliances and Cylinders
In addition to the sale of LPG, Petrogas purchases and sells
appliances and cylinders to customers. Empty cylinders are either purchased
locally at the price of LE12.8 per cylinder (half the sales) or are imported
at the cost of LE20. The price to the customers is LE14.9 for the first
cylinder and LE29 for subsequent ones. This selling price includes a
guarantee to repair or replace them as needed. The average life of the
cylinder is ten years. In 1978 sales of 164 thousand 30-liter cylinders,
1,500 90-liter cylinders and 35 thousand LPG appliances yielded a net profit
of LE170 thousand representing about 11 percent of net profit of LPG activi-
ties in that year.
Capitalization
Petrogas' capitalization as of September 1, 1978 (date of its
incorporation and of its last Balance Sheet) was as follows:
LE           US$
(millions)
Net Fixed Assets                             13.3         19.2
Current Assets                    6.2
Less:  Current Liabilities        6.3        (0.1)        (0.2)
Total Net Assets                        13.2         19.0
Represented by Equity                        13.2         19.0
The fixed assets consist essentially of LPG cylinders, vehicles
and storage facilities. The major share of the company's current assets
consisted of LPG stocks and spare parts, (LE4.1 million) and receivables,
(LE1.8 million); a significant part (44%) of current liabilities relates
to payments due to EGPC for LPG supplies.

At the time of its institution, Petrogas had no long term debt.
Its authorized capital is presently set at LE30 million of which LE13.2
million has been paid in through LPG related set transfers. The level of
paid in capital would be discussed at negotiations (paras. 3.04 and 4.02).
Future Operations
Based on requirements for asset renewals and for expansion in
activity, Petrogas had projected capital expenditures on LPG investments
amounting to LE34 million (US$50 million) for the five year period between
1979 and 1983.
Investments

Vehicles                      1.0     0.8      0.8     0.8      0.7        4.1
Cylinders                     6.7     3.8      1.8      1.9     1.9       16.1
Other Expenditure             0.3     0.2      0.2     0.2      0.2        1.1
Total Expenditure            10.1     9.0      5.6     4.8      4.6       34.1
Given the limited projected profit on sales, and profit distribution
requirements as detailed in para. 4.23, the company's internal cash generation
from LPG operations is unlikely to cover more than 20% of this requirement
over this period. It is therefore probable that the largest share of these
budgeted investments will be met from EGPC resources. Assurances will be
obtained at negotiations that Petrogas would not dispose of its surplus funds
generated by natural gas operations for its LPG activities, unless sufficient
funds are available to meet the totality of requirements for gas operations
(para. 4.04).

10% a year.
6.        Petrogas incurs taxes on its incomes retained as legal reserves,
assets reserves and state bank reserve at the rate of 39.7%. For income tax
purposes, depreciation expense is based on historical cost, and losses can be
carried forward up to 3 years.
7.        Loan interest has been taken at 8.25% on the average balance of
long term debt outstanding for the year.
Balance Sheet and Flow of Funds
1.        Gross capital assets and accumulated depreciation are revalued at
the rate of 10% a year.
2.        Accounts receivable represent one month of sales.
3.        Cash is assumed to be at least 3% of the sales.
4.        Petrogas allocates 2% of its earnings to Nasr Bank reserve.  It
furthermore allocates 15% of its net income as follows: 5% to Legal reserve,
5% to State Bank reserve and 5% to Assets reserve. The rest of its earnings
are partly paid as dividends to shareholders, partly transferred to EGPC and
partly distributed to employees according to usual practices in Egyptian
petroleum sector. These provisions are taken to come into effect when incomes
have absorbed initial losses.
5.        Accounts payable represent one month of operating expenses and it
has been assumed that Petrogas pays EGPC for gas within 30 days.
