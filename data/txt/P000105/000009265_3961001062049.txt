MEMORANDUM AND RECONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BENIN
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL SERVICES RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Development
Credit to the Republic of Benin for SDR 9.3 million CUS$ 12.3 million equivalent)
is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be issued on standard IDA
terms with 40 years maturity and would help to finance an Agricultural Services
Restructuring Project. The principal implementing agency would be the Ministry
of Rural Development and Cooperative Action (MDRAC).
2.      Country Background.  Between 1977 and 1982 the Beninese economy achieved
an average real growth of about SZ per annum. This growth resulted in part from
buoyant investment activity and in part from strong reexport and agricultural
export trade with neighboring countries. The end of the boom in those countries
and the completion of major public sector projects left Benin saddled with low
return investments, a heavy external debt service and a poorly managed state-
dominated modern sector. A first piecemeal response from the Government yielded
limited results. In 1989, the Government adopted a more radical approach to
structural adjustment with the support of IDA and IMF as well as of other donors.
3.      The structural adjustment program entailed a major departure from
centrally planned economic policies towards greater reliance on private
initiative and market forces. Progress was achieved ii- reforming trade policies,
liquidating nationalized banks and public enterprises and reducing the public
wage bil'_'. However, the economic and financial context deteriorated in the
second half of 1989, with a contraction of Governaent revenues following the
decrease in transit trade, the lack of liquidity of the banking system, and
declining tax and duties collection due to growing fraud and intermittent
strikes. With the resolution of the political crisis early in 1990, conditions
for the implementation of structural reforms were re-established, and conditions
for the release of the second tranche of SAL I were' fulfilled by June 1990.
4.      Sectoral Background. Benin's economic performance is largely determined
by that of its agricultural sector. Benin farmers have been flexible in adapting
both their cash an, food cropping patterns to changing financial signals, and the
introduction of draZt cultivation has been rapid where warranted. However, as
a result of a historic interest by the donors and Government in cotton, modern
inputs  and extension  support have been  limited mostly  to cotton  areas.
Elsewhere, cropping techniques are still primitive, slash and burn cultivation
is predominant and yields are below those of some of the neighboring countries.
All the above result in a negative impact on the preservation of natural
resources because of excessive deforestation and soil erosion.
5.     Agricultural services are presently supported through six regional rural
development projects financed by external donors, including two with IDA
participation.  Each covers one of the six ddparteents (ex-provinces) of the
country and is implemented by a Regional Rural Development Agency (CARDER). Some
of these projects have started operating only recently; others are almost at the
end of their externally-financed periods.  With the projects being foreign-
financed and donor-driven, the government has had little control over the
objectives and administration of field agricultural services. Also, the CARDERs



have become involved in a number of activities which would be better entrusted
to private sector operators. Overall, these services have not been tailored to
the real needs of the farmers or herders, especially of women farmers, or always
been responsive to environmental considerations. Due to past mismanagement,
staff lack training and their numbers are excessive. Agricultural research has
been conducted in isolation from extension and from farmers, without ciear
policies or correct priorities, and with emphasis on export crops.
6.     Government policy has recently evolved from a centralized, marxist
approach to a liberal market-oriented economy. State agencies and enterprises
are withdrawing from commercial and production activities.  HDRAC is at the
vanguard of change in the process of redefining its policies, objectives and
action plan within the framework of the wider government reform. A workshop was
organized by MDRAC in July 1990, with the participation of ministry staff and
representatives of donor agencies and professional groups in which a wide
consensus was reached in favor of a smaller public service base while giving
greater scope to the provision of services to agriculture by the private sector.
7.     The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has
completed several studies of the reorganization of MDRAC, the CARDERs and seed
farms. The recommendations of the studies, including tie reduction of staff of
these institutions by more than 602, have been widely accepted by Government on
condition that funds be made available for an adequate compensation of civil
servants to be laid off. The recommendations are also welcomed by other donors.
8.     Proiect obiectives.  The main objectives of the proposed project would
be to assist the Government, within a three-year period, to begin restructuring
Benin's agricultural institutions. The project aims to (a) organize MDRAC around
its priority objectives of establishing, budgeting for and monttoring Bonin's
rural development policies, programs and legislation, collecting and diffusing
information relevant to the rural population and implementing applied research;
and (b) improve the efficiency of agricultural and livestock services, reduce
their cost and transfer to the private sector services which are not of a public
nature, thus making remaining public services more responsive to environmental
and farmer needs, including those of women and transient herders. The project
would support increasing the involvement of farmer organizations in the
supervision and, later, management and partial financing of field agricultural
services so that these services better respond to real farmer needs.  Better
linkages would be built between extension, research and farmers, and between
cropping and livestock activities.
9.     Proiect description.   The project would restructure the country's
agricultural institutions, including the central sexvices of MDRAC, research and
development and seed production stations, and the six CARDERs, while limiting
their operations to those normally undertaken by the public administration. The
project is estimated to cost the equivalent of US$29.6 million.  It would be
financed through a credit from IDA (US$12.3 million equivalent) and grants from
French assistance (FF 20 million--US$3.5 million equivalent), the European
Development Fund (US$ 2.9 million equivalent), German Technical Cooperation
(DM1.8 mlUlion--US$l million equivalent), the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (US$3.7 million equivalent), UNDP (US$1.5 million) and the Government
(US$4.8 million dollar equivalent). The restructuring would entail a reduction
of about 632 of MDRAC and CARDER staff, mainly among the two lowest staff grades.



- 3 -
CcGpensation would be paid for these redundancies from funds outside the project.
The project would accomplish these objectives through a combination of policy
reforms and investment.
10.     On-lending would be done through financial intermediaries acceptable to
IDA and would be subject to regular monitoring. The funds would be passed on to
these intermediaries at the BCEAO rediscounting rate and on-lent to the final
borrowers at prevailing market rates. The exchange risk would be borne by the
State, and the risk of non-recovery would be borne by the intermediary.
11.         The agricultural policy measures, spelled out in a Letter of Rural
Development Policy of the Government, would consist of thes Ca) new statutes for
MDRAC and the CARDERs; (b) personnel management regulations which would help
prerserve institutional memory and justify the expenditure on training financed
by the project; Cc) updated cooperative legislation; (d) release of some 3,800
MDRAC and CARDER staff; (e) privatization of seed farms; (f) preparation of a
code for veterinarians; (g) privatization of the State enterprise for veterinary
pharmaceutical imports; (h) taxation of imported meats; and (i) a health services
action plan for the livestock sector.
12.     Proiect investments would comprises (a) restructuring NDRAC's central
services around fewer staff (560 instead cf 1200) and more direct lines of
responsibility; (b) restructuring the CARDERs with a transfer of some activities
to the private sector, improvement of agricultural extension and of management
advice to village groups, and reduction of staff from 4,910 to 1,750; (c)
training in management, farmer needs and motivations and environmental concerns
for staff remaining in the MDRAC and CARDERs; (d) strengthening research sad
development in the farmers' own environment and with their participation; (e)
equipment and operating funds for seed production; (f) restructuring the central
and regional livestock services; tg) facilitating the return of a part of the
MDRAC and CARDER personnel to private sector activities by means of training and
credit components; (h) technical assistance; and (i) legal and technical studies.
13.     Lessons from experience.   Lessons learnt from earlier agricultural
services projects in Benin and in Africa have helped improve the design of the
project towards a better understanding of farmer needs and their environment, a
better separation of public and private sector responsibilities and activities
and a more efficient decentralization of public sector activities.
14.      Rationale for IDA involvement. The project would be consistent with the
Government's development priorities and IDA's lending strategy which aims at
promoting sustainable growth through increases in production and export earnings.
The proposed project is nationwide in scope and forms a key component in Benin's
structural adjustment program. It would facilitate the transfer to the private
sector of activities which presently burden the national budget while providing
an efficient institutional framework for other agricultural projects. IDA has
experience of collaboration with the CARDERs and is the sole donor that has taken
the initiative of funding projects of national scope in Benin outside the cotton
sector.   IDA is also well placed to help strengthen extension and research-
development services as part of its Africa Agricultural Services Initiative.
15.    Aareements reached. Conditions for credit effectiveness would be the (a)
performance of the essential tasks preparatory to the reorganization of the MDRAC



- 4 -
and the CARDERs; (b) arrival in Cotonou of key consultants; tc) budgeting by the
Governtaent of the funds to compensate for the release of redundant staff; and (d)
appointment of independent external auditors. Other key agreements reached at
negotiations comprise the privatization of the seed farms, the implementation of
a livestock health services action plan and conditions pertaining to the
provision of sub-loans.
16.     Environmental imnact.  The project would have no direct impact, positive
or negative, on the environment. However, the project would provide a tool for
the implementation of a natural resources project under preparation and for the
promotion of sustainable farming practices, including integrated stock raising
and crop farming.  Staff would be trained to better take into consideration
environmental factors. Research and development operations would make both staff
and villagers more aware of methods available for preserving their land and
forest assets.
17.     Benefits.  The project would yield two kinds of benefitst (a) for farmers
and herders, (i) the introduction of services better targeted at their real
needs; and (ii) the development of private initiatives to provide inputs,
equipment maintenance, marketing and other services more effectively than public
sector agencies; and (b) for the State, (i) a significant reduction in budget
costs; and (ii) better control over its the planning and monitoring of its
activities in the rural areas. The social justification of the project lies in
the emphasis it places on food crops to enhance the country's food security and
on the poorest farmers, women and young people.
18.     Risks.   The principal risks are: (a) a temporary negative impact on
agricultural production, particularly cotton, during the transfer of certain
services to the private sector; (b) management of the civil service that does not
meet project criteria; and (c) a limited capacity of training centers to ensure
timely execution of the training programs planned.  The measures designed to
reduce these risks include training and credit for a large number of civil
servants to be made redundant, the temporary retention of certain activities
under the CARDERs, and the medium-term capacity of village groups to take on the
task of providing essential services to cotton producers, the introduction of new
personnel regulations and the possibility of extending the project if necessary
to enable training programs to be completed.
19.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit complies with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
