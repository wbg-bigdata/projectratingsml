MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FOR GRADUATE EDUCATION PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic
of Indonesia for US$58.9 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would have
a term of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate,
and would help finance a University Research for Graduate Education Project.
2.          Background. Indonesia has achieved an impressive long term growth, based on sound
economic policies and successful reforms. The past achievements have brought Indonesia to a new
threshold of development, where the challenge is to sustain growth. Competition from other
developing economies in East Asia has intensified pressures for Indonesia to make the transition to a
higher productivity economy. For meeting these challenges, quality upgrading at all levels of
education will be necessary. Improving the quality of higher education is a prerequisite for
strengthening Indonesia's competitive edge, and critical for ensuring sustained development of the
country's scarce professional, managerial and technical humian resources. However, this must be
accomplished during a period when there is increased demand for gcvernment resources within
education, owing to the stated goa' to universalize nine years of basic education. The main issue for
higher education, therefore, is how scarce public funds can be utilized most efficiently to complement
private finanicing. Clearly, pub!ic resources must be targeted to priority areas where private financing
is likely to be inadequate.
3.          Graduate Education and University Research. Among priority areas for public
investments, graduate education and university research command special attention for several reasons.
First, graduate education is critical for upgrading qualifications of teaching staff in the universities
them.selves. Second, research capacity in universities is important for keeping abreast of international
developments in order to enable adaptation of scientific knowledge and to meet the country's particular
needs. Third, a critical mass of highly trained individuals active in graduate education and research
is essential in improving the quality standards of higher education as a whole. Yet, Indonesia's
capacity for graduate education and research is strikingly weak. In contrast to rapidly expanding
undergraduate enrollments, g-aduate enrollments are only about 10,000 or 0.7 percent of total
undergraduate enrollments compared with 2.4-3.3 percent in China, Thailand, Mexico, and Brazil.
Research productivity of Indonesian researchers is also low: the number of articles in internationally
recognized scientific journals published by Indonesian researchers per year is one third of those in
Thailand or Kenya, a quarter of Nigeria, less than 10 percent of Korea and 2 percent of China.
Weaknesses in graduate education and research coexist with extensive public investments in overseas
fellowships for graduate training, leaving future staff upgrading continuously dependent on overseas
education.
4.          Government Strategy. In the past decade, the Government began to focus on quality
upgrading of higher education, and supported graduate level fellowships for university staff, as well
as investments in libraries and laboratory facilities. Recognizing that competition for resources is a
powerful stimulus to quality improvement, the Government has introduced competitive research grant
schemes. The Government plans to focus on the improvement of incentives in guiding quality
improvement.



2
5.          For graduate education and university research, the Government is establishing the
University Research Council (URC) to administer competitive grant and fellowship programs.
Similarly, the Government plans to revamp the existing accreditation systeiii, and as the first step, has
commissioned a task force to review options. To improve equity of access to higher education, the
Government has started providing scholarships to students from lower income groups, and is planning
to launch a review of the failed student loan scheme, with a view to developing options for financial
aid to needy students. To improve efficiency, the Government has taken steps to grant financial
autonomy to public institutions in utilizing private revenues, and assisted the development of effective
accounting systems within public universities. The Government is emphasizing research capacity
building, as articulated in its One-Gate Policy which aims to improve the quality of research in
accordance with national priorities. In the higher education sector, under the oversight of the Director
General of Higher Education, the URC will be responsible for the implementation of this Policy.
6.          Lessons Learned. In designing this project, lessons of experience from PCRs for
projects in higher education in Iiidonesia, supervision reports, the OED report on educational lending
in Indonesia as well as the Bank's Best Practice Paper on higher education were reviewed and
discussed. In particular, the lessons that have been taken into account include the importance of: (a)
designing compact. targeted projects to ensure effective implementation; (b) focussing on the
development of domestic graduate education capacity; (c) strengthening the effectiveness of overseas
fellowships through better re-entry conditior,s for returning fellows; (d) improving financial and
professional incentives for staff; (e) ensuring sustainability of project interventions through developing
institutional capacity; and (t) ensuring effective equipment procurement through users' involvement
in decision making.
7.          RaItionale for Bank Involvement. As highlighted in the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy for Indcnesia which was presented to the Executive Directors on April 12, 1994, human
resource development is a key objective for Indonesia's development. Strengthening domestic
educational capabilities to develop professional, managerial and scientific human resources, through
quality improvement of higher education is a critical element for sustaining growth. The proposed
project is co,Lsistent with the country assistance strategy. Improving graduate education and university
research is a priority area for public investments within higher education. Because of its experience
under past and ongoing education projects which have supported fellowship and research programs and
established the Inter-University Centers for graduate education and research, the Bank is well placed
to assist the Government in instituting a competitive incentive system for funding graduate education
and research programs.
8.          Project Objectives. The overall goal of the project is to improve the quality of
graduate education in Indonesia. Specifically, the project would: (a) increase competitive funding for
domestic graduate education and university research activities; (b) strengthen the procedures for
selecting grant and fellowship proposals; (c) integrate university research with graduate training in
universities; (d) strengthen research capacity and dissemination of research findings in universities; and
(e) attract highly qualified candidates for domestic graduate education.
9.          Project Description. To achieve the above objectives, the project would: (a) improve
the planning and managing of graduate education and university research through the development of
the University Research Council; and (b) support competitive research grant and fellowship programs.
These two components are discussed below:



3
(a)   For improving planmiing and management of graduate education and university
research, the project would provide assistance to the URC to carry out its functions.
As part of the Directorate General of Higher Education (DGHE) in the Ministry of
Education and Culture, the URC will administer all existing and new competitive grant
and fellowship programs for graduate education and university research in Indonesia.
It will also provide policy advice to the DGHE on the development of graduate
education and research capacity. To this effect, the project u ll finance the services of
international and local consultants, overseas and local training, incremental recurrent
costs for the operation of the URC, and project management costs.
(b)   Competitive Grarnt and Fellowship Programs. The project will support selected
competitive grant and fellowship programs. All grants and fellowships would be
awarded on a competitive basis through proposals and application selected by the URC
on the basis of agreed criteria and procedures. The project would support the following
programs:
(i) The Center Grant Program to provide grants for upgrading physical and human
resources infrastructure for research and graduate education in selected
university units with demonstrated potential;
(ii) Research Grant Programs to provide research grants for high quality research
activities to be carried out by research teams including graduate students, and
young academics who have recently completed their doctoral degrees;
(iii) Graduate Education Programs to provide merit fellowships to attract good
quality master's and doctoral students on the basis of a national competition, and
grants to academic units to establish collaborative programs with foreign
universities and provision of pre-graduate training programs; and
(iv) Scientific Publication Programs to provide grant support for quality improvement
of professional and scientific journals, and publication grants for first time
authors of scientific and technical articles published in internationally reputable
journals.
10.         The project will be implemented over a period of about five years. The total cost is
estimated at US$97.6 million of which the Bank would cover US$58.9 million (61 percent of the
project cost excluding taxes). The Government would provide US$38.7 million. A breakdown of
project costs and the financing plan are in Schedule A, and the amounts and the method of
procurement are summarized in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events are shown
in schodule C, and the status of Bank Group's operations is given in Schedule D. A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 12841-IND dated May 16, 1994 is being distributed
separately.
11.         Project Implementation. The DGHE would be responsible for ove il management
of the proposed project. Under the general authority of the DGHE, the URC and its Commissions
woule, be responsible for selection, monitoring and evaluation of competit, c grant and fellowship
programs. The URC Secretariat will be established as a functional unit within the DGHE. A small
Project Implementation Unit will provide project-specific administrative support for the implementation
of the project.

12.         Project Sustainability. The institutional development of the URC would play a critical
and catalytic role in ensuring continuity of competitive funding in support of university research and
graduate education. The Government's commitment to the URC is demonstrated by the preparatory
actions already taken for its establishment, as well as the decision to transfer responsibilities for the
existing DGHE programs to the URC. Because of the Government's: (a) past commitment to
increasing funding for competitive research grant programs, (b) articulated policy to strengthen
research capacity especially through human resource development, and (c) increasing focus on the need
for building capacity for domestic graduate education, the prospect for sustaining funding for research
and graduate education is good. in the medium to long term, the viability of investments in higher
education including graduate education, would depend critically on the systemic changes in the manner
in which public funds are channelled. These include granting greater financial autonomy to public
institutions, decentralizing staffing and promotion decisions to universities, and rationalizing public
subsidies for higher education through funding mechanisms that are based on performance. All of
these are central to the on-going educational sector policy dialogue between the Bank and the
Government. The URC will be an essential component of the financing system for higher education,
and represents a significant step in establishing performance-oriented funding mechanisms.
13.         Agreements Reached. During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that:
(a)   the URC's activities would be carried out in accordance with policies and operating
guidelines, procedures, criteria and conditions acceptable to the Bank, including the
adequacy of remuneration for selected university staff;
(b)   the URC Secretariat and the PIU would be maintained within DGHE in accordance with
terms of reference, staffing, and other resources such as office space and budgetary
resources, acceptable to the Bank;
(c)   a mid-term review would be conducted in accordance with terms of re lerence acceptable
to the Bank before March 31, 1998; and
(d)   technical audits would be conducted annualy by an independent body, starting before
April 1, 1996, in accordance with terms of reference and in a manner acceptable to the
Bank, to review activities funded under grants and fellowships on a sample basis,
14.         Benefits and Risks. Tne project will lead to increased funding for domestic graduate
education and university research, in line with public investment priorities in the sector. With the
responsibilities assigned to it, the URC is expected to play a catalytic role in enabling te Government
to invest more resources in graduate education and research, and increase efficiency in the use of these
resources. At the end of the project, an estimated total of 1,500 graduate student places would have
been improved through project investment under various grant and fellowship programs. About 500
students would proceed to their graduate studies, most of whom would be employed in the public and
private universities, and 400 university staff with demonstrated potential would comnplete their graduate
studies. The project would also strengthen the DGHE's capacity to select proposals for university
research and graduate education on a competitive basis. This would enable a concentration of research
funding in institutions, principal investigators and teams that are able to conduct research and advanced
scientific training activities to an international standard. Competition for grants and fellowships will
significantly alter the present incentive structure, rewarding high quality research and training outputs.

15.         To alleviate potential -isks for the project, the following measures have been
incorporated into project design. To ensure that the project is within the implementation capacity, the
ntmmber of new programs has been reduced, and contracting and administrative requirements have been
simplified. Also, steps have been taken to facilitate the development of twinning relationships between
the URC and a foreign research council with similar functions. To ensure that project funding will
be directed to high quality activities, the investment level for each program has been determined ducing
project preparation through a careful assessment of: (a) the size of currently available resources;
(b) the size of the beneficiary population; and (c) expected levels of cumpetition. Monitoring and
evaluation activities by the URC have been designed in detail, with provisions for discontinuation of
funding for non-performers. Technical audits have also been built into the project.
16.         Environmental Impact. The proposed project would incur no direct environmental
costs and has an environmental rating of "C." Increased capacity in biological, physical and social
sciences, engineering and environmental manLgement disciplines is expected to have some favorable
impact on the country's capacity to address environmental problems. The Operating Guidelines for
the URC stipulates that all activities to be funded un.der the URC must comply with prevailing rules
on environmental and ethical concerns.
17.         Impact on Women. Past studies have found that women face difficulties in attending
overseas graduate programs because of family and other cultural constraints. Improved domestic
graduate education opportunities are expected to have a favorable impact on femrale participation in
graduate programs for two reasons: (a) fellowships are available directly upon graduation from
undergraduate programs at a younger age, which is likely to reduce conflicts with child bearing
responsibilities; and (b) for those who already have families, it will be easier for them to attend
graduate schools in Indonesia.
18.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Article
of Agreements of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
