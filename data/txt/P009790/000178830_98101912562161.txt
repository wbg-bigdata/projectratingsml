INDIA - REFINERIES RATIONALIZATION
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Government of India (GOI) has requested Bank financing for a
Refineries Rationalization Project (the Project). The main objectives of the
Project are to expand and modify refining capacity in order to reduce the
imbalance between the domestic demand for and supply ol petroleum products in
the country and to improve the energy efficiency of the sector. Most existing
refineries in India currently have very simple configurations, consisting
principally of distillation units. The Project represents a major effort to
install additional capacity and secondary processing capabilities at four
major refineries to convert fuel oil into higher valued products. Two of
these refineries are wholly owned by GOI; the other two refineries have
also private shareholders. The Project will include two major components:
(i) the capacity expansion and secondary processing component; and (ii) the
energy efficiency and pollution control component. The first component will
include: (a) at Cochin Refineries Ltd., expansion of crude processing
capacity from the present 3.3 million metric tons per year (tpy) to 4.5
million tpy with a new fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) facility of 1.0 million
tpy; (b) at Madras Refineries Ltd., doubling the crude processing capacity
from the present 2.8 million tpy to 5.6 million tpy with a new FCC facility
of 0.6 million tpy capacity; (c) at the Visakh refinery of Hindustan Petroleum
Corporation, expansion of crude processing capacity from 1.5 million tpy to
4.5 million tpy with a new FCC facility of 0.6 million tpy capacity; (d) at
the Bombay refinery of Bharat Petroleum Corporation, revamping and expansion
of crude processing capacity from 5.0 million tpy to 6.0 million tpy and
installing a new FCC unit of 0.6 million tpy capacity; and (e) at the Bombay
Refinery of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, installation of a sulfur recovery
unit. All the above subprojects will also include modifications and additions
to utilities generation, tankage, distribution and other infrastructural
facilities to the extent necessary to achieve sustained operation at the
enhanced capacities. Under the energy efficiency and pollution control
component, facilities for these purposes will be installed at the above
mentioned refineries as well as at six other refineries in India.
1.02      The Government of India attaches highest priority to the development
of the energy sector, since inadequate domestic supplies of energy have been a
major constraint hindering India's economic growth. Up to now, however, GOI
has dedicated a substantial portion of its investments in the energy sector
in projects such as coal, gas, and hydropower which are primarily designed to
substitute for fuel oil. However, this program cannot address the problem of
middle distillates, since it is not economic at present to substitute for
them on a large scale. As a result, the country is currently importing large
amounts of diesel oil and kerosene, which in 1980/81 represented about 75% of
the cost of petroleum products imports. The proposed Project is intended to
resdress this imbalance by increasing the production of middle distillates in
four major Indian refineries. The Project, thus, will complement other energy



- 2 -
supply projects, help overcome structural problems in the refinery subsector
and have a significant impact in alleviating the country's balance-of-payments
burden. The Project is also needed to handle the increased volume and unusual
characteristics of Bombay High crude. It will involve expansion of facilities
at coastal refineries that were originally designed to be expanded. As shown
in Chapter X, the Project will enjoy very high economic rates of return.
1.03     The financing requirements of the Project, including escalation,
contingencies, interest during construction and working capital, are esti-
mated at US$1,086 million, of which about US$968 million are for the capacity
expansion and secondary processing component and US$118 million, for energy
efficiency and pollution control. The total foreign exchange cost of the
Project is US$468 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$200 million would
cover about 18% of the financing requirements. The balance of US$886 million
(or about 82% of Project cost) will be provided from internally generated
funds of the sponsoring companies and from Government resources.
1.04     The proposed Project was identified in November 1980 by a mission
consisting of Messrs. H.S. Kohli and E. Segura. It was appraised in July
1981 by Messrs. E. Segura (Chief), R. Bhan, D. Caplin, and N.C. Krishnamurthy,
of the Industrial Projects Department.
II. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Introduction
2.01     Inadequate domestic supply of energy has been a major constraint
hindering India's economic growth. Despite the extensive development of
domestic energy resources such as coal and hydroelectricity, and the recent
development of offshore petroleum resources, the country has not attained
energy self-sufficiency and remains dependent on imported oil to meet its
primary energy requirements. Since 1977, energy shortages have become more
acute, affecting several sectors of the economy. Although these shortages
were met by imports, and were due to unexpected circumstances--such as poor
monsoons which curtailed hydroelectric power generation, supply disturbances
in the oil-producing State of Assam, and extraordinary increases in inter-
national oil prices--they produced a serious deterioration in the country's
balance-of-payment situation. In fact, in 1980/81 the cost of imports of
crude oil and petroleum products increased by 75% over 1979/80 to
US$6.5 billion, representing 42% of total merchandise imports and absorbing
about 77% of total merchandise export earnings. In the future, the domestic
energy supply situation is expected to improve due to resumption of supplies
from Assam and anticipated additional oil production from offshore fields.
Nevertheless, given the expected high rate of growth in energy demand,
India would not be able to reach self-sufficiency in energy. In order to
minimize shortfalls, the Government has undertaken a concerted effort to
further explore and develop the country's domestic energy resources,
including petroleum (for which foreign oil companies have been invited
to participate), coal, hydroelectric and nuclear power, natural gas and
wood. On the demand management side, GOI has also introduced policy
changes, including improving the railways transport capabilities, helping



- 3 -
increase the energy efficiency of existing industrial companies, and
su'bstantially increasing energy prices to provide incentives for conservation.
Therefore, India has entered its Sixth Five-Year Plan (1980/81-1984/85) period
with most of the key policy issues in the energy sector addressed and an
aambitious production program backed by a substantial financial commitment. In
the Sixth Plan's investment targets, the share of the energy sector (gas,
oil, coal and power) in total plan outlay stands at 27.2% (compared with
25.1% in the Fifth Plan). Of this share, about 16% is allocated to the oil
and gas sector. Investments in the transportation sector to move coal and
oil will bring the share of the energy-related investments sector close to
35% of the total plan outlay.
B. India-s Energy Consumption
2.02     Commercial primary energy (coal, oil and electricity) accounts for
about 47% of total energy consumption in India, while 53% is derived from
non-commercial sources such as firewood, agricultural and animal dung. In
the period 1953/54-1978/79, total energy consumption grew at an average
annual rate of 3.1%. Commercial energy consumption grew at about 5.1% per
annum in the same period, whereas non-commercial energy consumption grew at
only 1.9% as shown in the table below:

2.03      The share of oil products in total and commercial energy consump-
tion is growing rapidly and in 1978/79 accounted for 11.2% of total energy
consumption, compared with 4% in 1953/54. Electricity has shown the sharpest
growth but remains the least important source of commercial energy, accounting
for 10.5% of total energy consumption in 1978/79, compared to 2.5% in 1953-54.
The share of coal in total energy supply has remained more or less steady at
the level of about 23-28%. Firewood is the most important fuel in India,
with about 140 million tons being consumed in 1978/79; the main source of
firewood is forest land which accounts for 75 million ha or 23% of the total
land area. Another major non-commercial fuel in India is animal dung,
obtained from cattle owned by the rural population. It is estimated that
approximately 72 million tpy of cow dung are used as fuel, equivalent to 8.4%
of total energy consumption in 1978/79. About 42 million tpy (9.5% of total
energy) of vegetable wastes such as bagasse, paddy husk and sawdust are also
used.
2.04     The sectoral breakdown of commercial energy used in India is given
in Annex 2-1. In 1978/79, in terms of coal equivalent, industry accounted
for about 56% of commercial energy consumption, with transportation accounting
for an additional 20% of the total. Although the share of agriculture has
increased threefold over the last twenty years (as commercial energy has
replaced animal and manual power, agricultural activity has increased, and
irrigation has been developed), it only stands at about 8% of the total.
Household use of commercial energy (11% of the total) is relatively small
because of the relatively low share of urban population, minimal heating
requirements and the consumption of firewood and other non-commercial energy
sources, particularly in the rural areas. The industrial sector uses prin-
cipally coal and electricity, with a limited demand for oil products (mainly
as feedstock), i.e., it uses only 6% of total oil consumption (Annex 4-1).
The transportation sector, on the other hand, is the largest user of petro-
leum products in the country, absorbing about 53% of total oil consumption.
C. Commercial Energy Resources
2.05     Domestic resources of coal and hydroelectricity are significant and
could be able to meet a large portion of India's future potential commercial
energy requirements, particularly for industry (heat) and power generation.
However, known oil and gas resources would not be sufficient, at least in the
short run, to meet the demand in sectors where the possibility of further
substitution by other fuels is limited (transportation and industry-feedstock).
Therefore, the exploration for new, and development of existing, petroleum
reserves is one of India's most pressing priorities. The supply prospects of
India's main commercial energy sources are briefly discussed below:
1. Coal
2.06     Coal is the main domestic source of commercial energy in India with
reserves (in seams greater than 1.2 meters thick and at depths less than
600 meters) estimated at about 85 billion tons, of which about 25 billion
tons are in proven reserves. The 1980/81 coal production is estimated at



107 million tons, an increase of 3% over the previous year's output
(Arnex 2-2). Coal production in recent years has suffered because of
extensive flooding in 1978, serious power shortages, delays in commissioning
nesi mines, lack of explosives, labor unrest, particularly in the eastern part
of the country, and transportation bottlenecks. Most of these problems are
being addressed. For example, the Sixth Plan embodies further measures to
overcome the infrastructure-related constraints, and labor relations have
improved in the past year. The Plan also includes significant investments to
bring new mines into operation. In order to increase productivity, a high
proportion of these new investments will be in open pit mining. Since in the
past most of the delays in bringing new mines into operation were experienced
in underground projects, the shift to open pit mining is expected to help in
reducing delays in project execution and commissioning. The environmental
effects of open pit mining, however, will have to be carefully assessed. The
share of open pit mining is projected to increase from 31% in 1980/81 to 55%
by the end of 1989/90, when coal output is projected by the Government to
reach 260 million tons. GOI demand projections for coal in the coming decade
show a more than doubling in demand from 107 million tons actually consumed
in 1980/81 to 246 million tons in 1989/90 (Annex 2-3). Of the 1989/90 coal
demand, power generation would account for about 45%, steel would utilize
about 20% and cement about 5% of the total. Of the projected 1989/90 coal
production of 260 million tons, just under half would come from existing
mines, 40% from sanctioned new mines and 10% from projects not yet sanctioned.
In order to fulfill this program, the coal industry will need not only to
overcome those problems referred to above of power shortages and labor
unrest, but also to avoid delays in project preparation and implementation,
and improve the ability of local equipment manufacturers to provide new
equipment and spare parts in a timely manner. Also, present training levels
for operational and maintenance personnel are not considered adequate even
for present requirements, and although an action plan has been drawn up for
future training centers and training procedures, it has not yet been implemented.
It may therefore prove difficult for the country to meet its 1989/90 coal
production targets. A more realistic achievement would be to increase coal
production to about 200-220 million tons by 1989/90.  A detailed review of
the coal sector is given in the Bank's sector report, "India's Coal Sector,"
dated July 1981.
2.   Electric Power
2.07     Total installed electrical generating capacity in 1980/81 is estimated
to have been 33,200 MW, including about 30,300 MW capacity installed at utilities
and about 2,900 MW captive capacity owned by industrial users. Of this capacity,
about 11,000 MW are derived from hydroelectric plants, and most of the balance
from thermal power plants; three nuclear power units have been installed to date
and two more are under construction or advanced planning. It is estimated that
potential resources of a further 60,000 MW of economically exploitable hydro-
electric power exist in the country. Potential demand for power has consistently
exceeded supply in the last decade. The gap has widened in recent years and
the shortage in 1979/80 is estimated to have reached over 16%. The basic
reasons for the gap between demand and supply are delays in completing planned
thermal generation capacity and low capacity utilization. Capacity utiliza-
tion of thermal power plants declined from about 55% in 1976/77 to below 43%



-6-
in April-December 1980. This was partly due to difficulties in commissioning
and unusually long stabilizing times in a large number of new plants; other
major factors are delayed maintenance in boilers and turbogenerators, lack of
spare parts, shortages of appropriately trained manpower, problems relating
to design and fabrication of domestically produced equipment and deterioration
in the supply and quality of coal available. A high-level commission has
recently carried out a comprehensive analysis of the situation and has sub-
mitted its findings to the Government. Several measures are being introduced
with Bank assistance to improve the efficiency of thermal plants, including:
(a) improved preventive and planned maintenance; (b) better availability of
spare parts; (c) improved training; (d) adequate coal supplies of acceptable
quality; and (e) more effective management. The results of these measures are
already having an impact in the sector and in 1980/81 power shortages dropped
significantly. With the implementation of the above measures more progress
is projected for the medium term.
2.08     In the Sixth Plan period (1981/85), power generation capacity is
planned to increase by 17,810 MW (an average annual growth rate of 12.3%),
as shown in Annex 2-4. Of this increase, 69% will come from thermal power
plants, 25% from hydroelectric units and 6% from nuclear plants. With the
implementation of this program, the country's overall average power energy
requirements would be met from 1984/85 onwards, although a peak capacity deficit
would most likely continue to exist until the early 1990s. While the projected
growth in installed capacity is higher than has been achieved in the past,
the targets are considered achievable in light of the high priority now being
given to the sector by the Government. Marked improvements have taken place
in recent years in overall power planning and project formulation, all the
projects in the Sixth Plan have been identified and approved by the Government,
and investment requirements (about US$25 billion) have been included in the
Sixth Plan. The Bank Group has been actively involved in the financing of
investments in the sector, and has so far lent US$2,455 million through
25 power projects. These projects have been successful in helping India to
cope with complex problems which had confronted the Indian electricity supply
industry since Independence. The main achievements of Bank Group operations
in the power sector have been to: (a) accelerate the installation of generating
capacity and promote measures to improve the technical levels of operation
and maintenance of existing plants; (b) foster development of comprehensive
long-range regional and national system plans which would assure implementation
of a least-cost power development program; (c) strengthen sector organization
and training; and (d) strengthen the finances of the institutions involved in
the sector.
3. Petroleum
2.09      Given its large sedimentary basins, both offshore and onshore,
India's prognostic recoverable hydrocarbon reserves 1/ were recently
estimated at 6.5 billion tons, of which about two-thirds are offshore.
Proven and probable reserves of oil initially in place in existing deposits
were estimated at 1.6 billion tons as of January 1978. Since these reserves
1/ Prognostic estimates give a broad indication of the total oil resources
and are based on a large number of assumptions. They should be used with
caution.

are not sufficient to meet the country's demand for oil, GOI has accelerated
its petroleum exploration activities in the country. It has opened up
selected areas to foreign exploration firms under production-sharing contracts,
and discussions are now being held, with interested foreign companies, to
further accelerate the exploration of India's petroleum resources.
2.10     Consumption of petroleum in India has increased at an annual rate of
8.2% over the last three decades as shown in the table below. However, pro-
duction increased at a faster pace than demand, allowing India to increase its
crude self-sufficiency from 6% in the early 1950s to a projected 45% in
1981/82.

a/ Imports of both crude and products, expressed in crude equivalent.
In 1979/80, petroleum product imports represented 35% of total
petroleum imports, in tons.
2.11     In 1980/81, the crude production of 10.6 million tons included
5.2 million tons from the Bombay High field, 3.6 million from Gujarat and
1.8 million from the Eastern Region. As mentioned, because of the political
situation in Assam, supply of crude oil to refineries in the Eastern region
ceased at the beginning of 1980, and although limited crude supplies to the
Assam refinery recommenced in late 1980, an embargo was maintained through
1980 on movements outside Assam of both crude oil and petroleum products. As
a result, production of about 3.5 million tons of crude oil was lost in
1980/81. Production from Assam has now returned to its normal level of about
5.0 million tpy.
2.12      A rapid increase in domestic oil production is planned in the medium
term mainly from offshore fields; besides Bombay High, two other fields, North
Bassein and Ratnagiri, are expected to become producers by 1984/85, when domestic
production is conservatively planned to supply about 52% -f Tndia's petroleum
requirements, on the basis of demand growth of 8% p.a. A conservative estimate
of planned domestic oil production is shown in the following table:

4. Natural Gas
2.13     Until the late 1970s, natural gas supply was limited to associated
gas from the Assam and Gujarat onshore fields, and played a relatively minor
role in the energy sector. Recently, natural gas has assumed greater importance
as an energy source with the development of the Bombay High offshore fields that
provide associated gas and the expected development of the Bassein fields, which
would provide non-associated gas. At the end of 1978, gas reserves were estimated
at 344 billion standard cubic meters (scm), a five-fold increase over the gas
reserves of 68 billion scm in 1973. Although there were marginal increases in
onshore gas reserves, most of the increases came from offshore fields--30 billion
scm from the Bombay High field, about 160 billion scm from the Bassein field and
at least 70 billion scm from the Tapti fields. While, due to the delay in the
completion of some industrial projects, part of this gas is now being used for
electric power generation, it is intended that over the medium term it will be
used primarily as fertilizer and petrochemicals feedstock; the heavier fractions
will be sold as bottled household liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to substitute
for kerosene and noncommercial energy sources. The Bank is assisting GOI in
the development of some of these fields and in the execution of nitrogenous
fertilizer projects, which will be the main users of these gas resources.
D. Overall Energy Supply and Demand Prospects
2.14     GOI has recently carried out a comprehensive study of India's future
energy supply and demand prospects, 1/ and has concluded that (i) commercial
energy availability may become a serious constraint to economic development,
either because domestic energy sources would be insufficient to meet demand,
or because the financial resources required to develop such sources may not
1/ "Report of the Working Group on Energy Policy," GOI, 1979.



- 9 -
be available; (ii) a coordinated energy conservation program in the industrial,
transport and household subsectors should be initiated, since it will have a
significant impact on reducing commercial energy demand; and (iii) the most
critical aspect on India's energy policy is to contain (within economic limits
the demand for petroleum products. As mentioned, the Sixth Plan contains
significant investments to achieve a better balance between energy supply and
demand. Nevertheless, as shown in the table below, the projected commercial
energy demand and supply balance for the Sixth Plan period shows that the
Indian economy will need to continue importing energy in the next five years.

E. Institutional Aspects of Petroleum Production
2.15     The Ministry of Petroleum, Chemicals and Fertilizers is in charge of
policy-making in the petroleum sector. It monitors and coordinates all
activities in the sector, and approves all investments and the budgets of
public companies operating in the sector. The Oil and Natural Gas Commission
(ONGC) and Oil India Limited (OIL) are engaged in the exploration and develop-



- 10 -
ment of indigenous hydrocarbon resources. ONGC is the main company in the
sector and is the principal entity through which GOI intends to explore
and develop hydrocarbon resources. At present, both ONGC and OIL have
active exploration programs. In the next five years, ONGC plans to drill
another 260 exploratory wells onshore and 95 offshore; OIL plans to drill
140 exploratory wells in the Eastern onshore region, as well as a number of
offshore wells. As mentioned, GOI has also decided to open selected
prospective areas to foreign firms. The institutional aspects of petroleum
production are discussed in more detail in the Appraisal Report of the Second
Bombay High Offshore Development Project dated November 5, 1980.
F.   Bank Assistance in Petroleum Production
2.16      The Bank has made two loans totalling US$550 million for the
development of the offshore Bombay High oil fields. The first loan
(Ln 1473-IN) was made in 1977 and financed Phase III of ONGC's Bombay High
development program. The Project was completed in March 1981, about nine
months behind schedule. The facilities are operating satisfactorily. A
Project Performance Audit is under preparation. A second loan for US$400
million (Ln 1925-IN) was made in December 1980 to assist in the financing of
Phase IV and advanced action on Phase V of the program. Project implementation
is proceeding satisfactorily.
III. REFINERY CAPACITY AND PRODUCTION
A. Background
3.01     Six companies--in both public and joint sectors--operate eleven
petroleum refineries in the country.l/ (See Map IBRD 15947 for the location
of the refineries.) Four of these companies are wholly Government owned,
viz., Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPC),
Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPC), and Bongaigaon Refinery and Petro-
chemicals Ltd (BRPL). Of the two companies with partial private ownership,
one, Cochin Refineries Limited, is jointly owned by GOI and Phillips Petroleum
Company (USA). The second company, Madras Refineries Ltd., is owned by GOI,
the National Iranian Oil Company and AMOCO (USA). The largest refinery
company is IOC which operates five refineries and is also responsible for
the country's import of crude oil and petroleum products. Marketing and
distribution are mainly in the hands of IOC, HPC and BPC. All other companies
rely on IOC for the marketing and distribution of their products. Retail
outlets are operated almost entirely by private dealers.
3.02      The existing refineries have simple processing configurations,
consisting principally of atmospheric and vacuum distillation units. Only
three refineries have catalytic crackers, four have coking units, two have
thermal crackers, while four refineries have facilities for catalytic
reforming and visbreaking. The simple configuration of the Indian refineries
results in a sub-optimum crude throughput and a limited production of middle
distillates. As mentioned in para 1.02, given the country's current and
projected demand for middle distillates, the configurations of these re-
fineries are being rationalized to better meet the future demand pattern.
1/   In addition to these eleven refineries currently in production in
India, a new refinery at Mathura is now under construction and is
expected to be commissioned later this year.



- 11 -
3.03      The four eastern refineries at Barauni, Gauhati, Bongaigaon and
Digboi are situated close to the onshore oil fields in Assam and utilize
indigenous crude. All the coastal refineries use either imported crude oil
or (for those situated on the West Coast) a mixture of imported crude and
domestic crude from Gujarat and Bombay High. The two inland refineries in
the northwestern region (at Baroda and Mathura) are connected by pipeline
with the Salaya port terminal.
3.04      In March 1981, the country's total installed refinery capacity was
31.8 million tons of crude, as shown in Annex 3. The current capacity of
most of the existing refineries is small, and only Baroda and BPC Bombay
have a capacity of more than 100,000 bpd (4.7 million tpy). The new refinery
at Mathura will have a capacity of 125,000 bpd (6 million tpy). Overall
capacity utilization was 86% in both 1977/78 and 1979/80, which is satisfactory
by international standards and is the highest among major process industries
in India. Capacity utilization, however, fell to 81% in 1980/81 (Annex 3),
principally due to a shortage of crude oil caused partly by the Iran-Iraq War
and partly by political problems in Assam. Since March 1981, however, these
problems have been contained, and under normal conditions of crude availability,
an all-India refineries utilization of 90% is expected in the future.
B. Historical Production of Refinery Products
3.05     The growth of production of major oil products from all Indian
refineries for the period 1970/71 to 1980/81 is shown in the following table.

- 12 -
3.06     In 1980/81, of the 25.8 million tons of crude processed, 10.6 mil-
lion tons were supplied from domestic fields and 15.2 million tons from
imports. During the 1970s, refinery production did not keep pace with the
demand growth and pattern, particularly in the period 1975-81, when significant
amounts of kerosene, high speed diesel oil and fuel oil had to be imported.
In the future, the country will maintain some imports of final petroleum
products, principally fuel oil. Nevertheless, since the demand for petroleum
products is expected to reach about 45 million tpy by 1985/86 and 60 million
tpy in 1990/91 (para 4.04), the Government has given high priority to the
expansion of the country's refinery capacity.
C. Expansion Plans
3.07     After the Mathura refinery comes on stream later this year, refinery
capacity in India will total 37.8 million tpy, which will still be inadequate
to meet India-s requirements in the 1980s. Therefore, the Sixth Five-Year
Plan includes major refinery investments totalling over US$2.6 billion, mainly
to (a) increase installed capacity by 55% to 58.8 million tpy; (b) add
6.1 million tpy of conversion capacity; and (c) improve the energy efficiency
of existing refineries. Investments are also planned for increasing product
storage (tankage) capacity.
3.08     The investment program includes expansion of existing refinery
capacities at Cochin, Bombay, Madras, Visakh, Mathura and possibly Haldia. In
addition, plans are underway for two new grassroots refineries, one possibly
on the West Coast at Mangalore (Karnataka State), and another in the North-
west, possibly at Karnal (Haryana State). The proposed refinery expansions,
including Haldia, would add 12.0 million tpy of nominal capacity. The two
grassroots refineries would contribute an additional 9 million tpy capacity,
in order to achieve the planned total refinery capacity of 58.8 million tpy
by 1987, or, assuming 90% capacity utilization, an effective crude throughput
of 52.9 million tpy. The investment plans also include schemes for the
revamping and debottlenecking of existing plants as well as facilities for
pollution control.
3.09     In addition to capacity expansion, the Sixth Plan includes install-
ation of secondary processing facilities in several of the existing refin-
eries, so as to match more closely the refineries production pattern with
the projected product mix demand. The intention is to convert fuel oils to
higher value middle distillates through the installation of several fluid cata-
lytic crackers (FCC) in existing refineries and to install in the two projected
grassroots refineries either FCCs or the more expensive hydrocrackers if they
prove to be more economical. An expansion of lubricating oil capacity at
Haldia, and the installation of a delayed coker at Barauni are also included
in the program.

and interest during construction, total costs would exceed US$2.6 billion.
b/  No decision has yet been made as to the allocation of the 9 million tpy of
new capacity to the new refineries and the conversion facilities to be used.
The mission assumes that 6 million tpy will be installed at Haryana and the
remainder at Mangalore.
These expansions and new refineries will substantially narrow the current
gap between the demand for and supply of refined products, but without additional
expansions beyond those shown in the above table, domestic production still
would meet only 80-85% of the projected 1989/90 product demand (para 4.05). The
supply gap, particularly for middle distillates and fuel oil, are expected to be
met by imports.
3.11     Of the above projects, the Gujarat, Barauni, Mathura and Haldia
schemes are already in advanced stages of implementation. The proposed
refinery capacity expansions and conversion facilities at Cochin, Bombay,
Madras and Visakh are the subject of the Project. Feasibility studies for
the two new grassroots refineries are under preparation and their implementation
is expected to start in 1982/83.
3.12      The refinery investment program has high priority since it will
(a) substantially reduce India's petroleum import bill by reducing imports of
petroleum products and substituting for them crude imports or increased use
of indigenous crude oil; (b) improve the product mix of petroleum products
produced in the country as compared to demand; and (c) improve energy
efficiency in most of the existing refineries.

D. Forecast of Refinery Products Production
3.13     Estimates of future output of refinery products have been prepared
by the Oil Coordination Committee (OCC) attached to the Ministry of Petroleum.
The Committee consists of representatives of the Ministry of Petroleum, and
of the country's production, import, refining and marketing organizations.
The estimates are based on the current timetable for installation of new
distillation capacity, as well as secondary processing units, and assume that
all projects already approved by GOI will be operational according to the
current schedule. They also assume that certain other projects currently
under consideration (i.e., increase in distillation capacity plus an FCC
at HPC-Bombay, a capacity expansion together with a new lube plant at Haldia,
and bitumen blowing facilities in other refineries) will also be implemented
during the 1980s. Since OCC's production estimates do not include output
from the two grassroots refineries now in the planning stage, production
from these refineries has been estimated by the mission and incorporated in
the projections. The table below gives the refinery production forecasts for
1990/91, assuming a 90% refinery capacity utilization for all refineries,
including the two new grassroots refineries, and for two scenarios, e.g.,
"Without" and "With" the proposed Project:

3.14     As discussed in the next Chapter, the growth in demand for petroleum
products is expected to outpace the increase in supply, with the result that,
except for motor gasoline and naphtha, the country will need to import
significant amounts of final products in the 1980s and 1990s.
IV. PETROLEUM PRODUCTS CONSUMPTION, DISTRIBUTION AND PRICING
A. Historical Consumption of Refined Products
4.01     During the last decade, consumption of refined petroleum products
in India grew at a rate of 5.6% per year from about 18 million tons in
1970/71 to almost 31 million tons in 1980/81, as shown in the table on the
next page. The past high rate of growth of petroleum products demand has
increased the share of petroleum products in commercial energy from 6% in
1970 to 11% in 1979 (para 2.03). The pattern of demand in India is such that
there is only limited scope for cutting petroleum consumption by conservation
because (i) consumption levels are already low; (ii) petroleum prices
overall are high by international standards (para 4.08); and (iii) the
demLand for most petroleum products is relatively inelastic since they are
principally used by the transport and agricultural sectors for productive
purposes. As shown in Annex 4-1, the demand for petroleum products by
households has been declining (there is very little space heating in homes);
also private automobile use is low. Most of the consumption of petroleum
products is therefore accounted for by public transportation, agriculture,
and industrial use, and is concentrated on diesel oil, kerosene and fuel
oils, which together account for 75% of the total consumption of petroleum
products. High speed diesel oil accounts for 33% of consumption, and is
mainly used by buses, trucks and railways. Kerosene accounts for an additional
14% of refinery products consumption and is used in urban areas as the
principal fuel for cooking, as well as for lighting in rural areas, where it
substitutes in part for increasingly scarce noncommercial fuels such as
firewood and cow dung. The principal use of light diesel oil (4% of total
refinery products) is for driving agricultural irrigation pumps. Fuel oil
represents 24% of refinery products consumption and is used in general trade
(including ships' bunkers), as a feedstock and fuel source for fertilizer
production, and as a primary and supporting fuel for electric power generation.
Due to the relatively low level of energy consumption per capita, already
high petroleum prices, supply constraints in other sources of energy (firewood,
coal and hydroelectric power), the scope for inter-fuel substitution is
considered limited.

a/ Light diesel oil consumption reached its lowest level (878,000 tons) in
1975/76; the growth in consumption over the period 1975/76 to 1980/81 was
5.1% per year.
4.02     During the decade, the rates of growth of demand have been irregular
for most products. Consumption of kerosene, gasoline and light diesel oil,
for instance, grew steadily until 1972/73, when significant price increases
took place, and then declined steeply until 1975. Thereafter, steady growth
in consumption of all three products recommenced. Consumption of fuel oil
grew steadily until 1973/74, when it reached a plateau for some years, and
then started to increase again in 1977/78. Consumption of high speed diesel
oil grew at compound rates until 1975/76, when consumption levelled off for a
year; since then growth has been virtually linear. The demand for naphtha
(almost entirely for the fertilizer and petrochemical industries) has exhibited
a steady growth over the decade, but is now levelling off. The consumption
of petroleum products on a regional basis is given in Annex 4-2.
B. Future Demand of Refinery Products
4.03     Detailed projections of future demand of petroleum products
were made in the first half of 1980 by the Indian Institute of Petroleum
(IIP). However, it is already apparent that these growth forecasts,
particularly for the next few years, were too high. Consequently, the



- 17 -
Bank made some modifications to the IIP assumptions of future growth rates
in the light of recent results and Bank staff's own experience and judgment.
For most products, three growth scenarios have been evaluated--low, median and
high. The main factors and assumptions affecting the expected evolution of
demand for petroleum products are given in Annex 4-3.
4.04       On the above basis, the following table shows the projections
under three scenarios of demand for 1985/86 and 1990/91:

C. Projected Supply and Demand Balance for Petroleum Products
4.05     The table below compares the median projections of demand given
in the preceding paragraph with the projections of production of refinery
products given in para 3.13. Production projections include the output from
the two new grassroots refineries, which are still in the planning stage.
Projections were estimated for two scenarios, e.g., "With" and "Without" the
proposed Project. It is anticipated that LPG produced under the Project will
replace part of the consumption of kerosene in the urban household sector;
therefore, the consumption of kerosene in the "With the Project" scenario is
lower than in the "Without the Project" scenario.

4.06      The above table shows that when fully operational, the proposed
Project will reduce the country's deficit of final petroleum products by
6.7 million tpy. Import requirements of diesel oil and kerosene will be
reduced by 4.5 million tpy. The amount of fuel oil imports will remain at
about the same level. There will be an additional excess of naphtha/gasoline
of 1.6 million tpy which will need to be exported or, if economical, could be
used to substitute for some of the fuel oil uses. The need for additional
refinery capacity over and above existing plans as well as the justification
of the proposed Project is evident from the above figures. As shown in
Chapter X, these investments will yield attractive economic rates of return
to the country.
4.07     Demand/supply projections, on a regional basis for 1990/91
are shown in Annex 4-4. The greatest imbalances would appear in the North-
western Region, but the Eastern and Western areas will also be in supply
deficit for middle distillates.
D. Petroleum Conservation and Pricing
4.08      As discussed, during the 1980s total consumption of petroleum
products is expected to grow between 5.4% and 7.9% per year, with a median
estimate of 6.9% p.a. GOI is aware that a high rate of growth in petroleum
products consumption may lead to unsustainable levels of petroleum imports.
It is, therefore, taking several measures to control the future rate of
growth of consumption of petroleum products relative to the expected rate of
growth in GDP of 4% to 5% in the 1980s. One of the measures to curb consumption
of petroleum products, in particular fuel oils, is to channel some of this
demand into other domestic sources, such as coal and hydroelectric power,



- 19 -
which are relatively plentiful in the country. -Another measure is to shift
goods and passenger traffic from diesel motor vehicles to railways, and
provide the railway with electrification capacity. As mentioned before,
however, the structure of petroleum consumption in India is such that the
scope for significant inter-fuel substitution is limited. Therefore, the
most important tool being used by GOI as a conservation measure is to set
petroleum prices at a level that will reduce the energy intensity of the
economy. The Government has set retail prices for most petroleum products at
levels which are comparable to or higher than prices elsewhere in the world,
as shown below:

b/ Based on crude oil at US$34 per barrel, and recent ratios of crude oil
prices to product prices in the Far East.
4.09      In July 1981, GOI increased petroleum prices, with the result that
the prices of gasoline, high speed diesel and fuel oil are significantly
above comparable CIF prices. Kerosene prices were also increased, but they
still remain below CIF prices: this gap, however, is more than compensated by
the higher prices for other products. Therefore, the average price for all
petroleum products is satisfactorily above the average CIF import prices.
I'he price of kerosene is kept low by GOI principally for social reasons. As
noted before, kerosene is used by households in urban areas as the principal
fuel for cooking, and lighting in rural areas, where it substitutes in part
f'or scarce fuels such as firewood and cow dung. Low kerosene prices are not
likely to result in significant diversion of kerosene to other uses such as
diesel oil, as evidenced by the fact that kerosene consumption presently
represents only 14% of total petroleum products (which is lower than in many
developing countries) and in the decade from 1970 to 1980 grew at a rate
lower than the rate for diesel oil. Furthermore, the supply of kerosene,
considered as an essential commodity, is closely monitored by GOI and it is
released only in small quantities and through fair price shops, primarily to
restrain diversion to uses other than essential household needs. Therefore,
the level and structure of petroleum prices in India is appropriate. GO0
periodically reviews petroleum prices and generally raises them at least once
a year to reflect changes in international and domestic conditions. In July
1981, the price of indigenous crude was also increased substantially to US$19
per barrel and now provides adequate cash flows to the oil producing companies
lo carry out their investment programs.



- 20 -
4.10      Regarding petroleum prices received by the refineries, GOI sets for
each refinery company a "retention price" per ton of crude equivalent, which
allows it to cover its total costs and earn a return of 15% on its capital
employed. The cost elements include crude oil and operating costs based on
operation at efficient, defined norms particular to each refinery. To the
extent that an individual refinery does not have an unrestrained choice in
selecting its crude mix, the unit cost of crude oil to the refinery is
computed as a notional one, representing the weighted average of the total
price of local and imported crudes processed by all refineries taken together.
The difference between the computed notional crude oil price to the refinery
and the actual prices paid by the individual refinery for its crude oil
procurement is pooled and redistributed among the refineries periodically,
under the crude oil price equalization account administered by OCC. Other
refining costs particular to each refinery are computed on the basis of
historical norms and revised periodically.
4.11      The ex-refinery prices charged by each refinery to its distributors
are not the same as the "retention prices" accruing to the refinery. Each
refinery is considered to be a primary pricing point and ex-refinery prices
are set at the same level at all pricing points in the country. Ex-refinery
prices are set by GOI by: (i) averaging the total cost of refining operations
and profits for all refineries in the country; and (ii) using relative
product pricing ratios for the different petroleum products that reflect
socio-economic values to the economy. The differences between ex-refinery
prices and retention prices are pooled and redistributed among refineries by
the OCC, in order to compensate each refinery for the differences between the
total margin allowed to it under the retention price formula and the actual
revenues received by it. Central Government taxes are added at the ex-refinery
level and are fully included in the sales prices. Prices at major distribution
points are derived by adding to the ex-refinery prices Government taxes and
other elements which allow the marketing companies to cover: (i) their
operating cost and earn a profit margin on its employed capital; and (ii) the
weighted average cost of transport (based on current rail freight rates) of
all products to individual depots. Retail prices include other State Government
and local taxes, and transportation costs from the depots to the retail
outlets. The current system of setting retention and ex-refinery prices is
working well as indicated among others by the high capacity utilization rates
and satisfactory cash generation levels achieved by most refineries. It is
based on economic costs on the average and is considered satisfactory
(para 9.02).
E. Marketing and Distribution of Petroleum Products
4.12     The principal oil companies entrusted by GOI with the wholesale
marketing and distribution of petroleum products are IOC, HPC and BPC. IOC
is the largest company and is responsible for about half of all petroleum
products marketed and distributed in India. These three companies have
marketing and distribution networks covering all India. The final distri-
bution at the retail level is mainly in the hands of private dealers. The
three main marketing companies draw their supplies from imported sources as
well as from domestic refineries. Because of comprehensive product exchange
arrangements, the marketing arms of the companies draw their supplies from



- 21 -
thle closest and most appropriate supply point and are not restricted to
distributing products from their own refineries; such product exchange
arrangements are usual practice in the petroleum industry. There are 22 major
marketing terminals in the country with storage and ancillary infrastructure,
These terminals are located at the refineries, importing ports and selected
points on product pipeline routes.
4.13     The main modes for the long-distance transport of petroleum products
are railways, pipelines and coastal tankers. In 1980/81, about 16.4 million
tons of products were moved by rail, about 4.7 million tons by pipeline and
2.7 million tons by coastal tankers. There are six major product pipelines Ln
the country, with an aggregate length of 1,320 km (plus two crude pipelines).
Four more lines totalling 990 km are in the planning stage. Sea movement of
products by coastal tankers is principally from refineries to other supply
points along the coast. Railways are utilized for moving products from
refineries, marketing terminals, coastal supply points, and pipeline tap-off
points, to some 120 up-country marketing depots. While bulk consumers obtain
petroleum supplies directly by rail from refineries and marketing terminals
(or a few via short distance pipelines), most retail outlets and customers
receive their supplies by road transport from the up-country marketing
depots. There are about 12,000 retail outlets in India which are mainly
operated by private dealers, though the facilities may be owned by the
refinery companies. There are also about 5,000 dealerships for light diesel
oil and kerosene.
4.14     GOI's Sixth Plan envisages investments of about US$470 million for
additions to petroleum marketing and distribution infrastructure. These
investments will consist principally of product storage and tankage facilities,
new consumer depots, product pipelines, and facilities for marketing liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG) as well as computers for the scheduling and control of
product movements. About half of this expenditure will be incurred by IOC and
the rest by the other marketing companies.
V. PROJECT SPONSORS
5.01     The refinery companies participating in the Project are Bharat Petro-
:Leum Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, Madras Refineries Limited and
Cochin Refineries Limited. The first two companies are wholly Government-owned,
while the last two have partial private ownership.
A. Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPC)
1. Management and Organization
5.02     Bharat Petroleum Corporation was established in August 1977,
from the consolidation of Burmah-Shell Refineries Limited and Burmah-Shell
Oil Storage and Distribution Company of India Limited, the respective refin-
ing and marketing companies of Burmah-Shell in India which were founded in
1955.



- 22 -
5.03     BPC is now fully owned by GOI and registered as a limited company
under the Companies Act. The Chief Executive Officer of the company is a
Government-appointed Chairman-cum-Managing Director. The Board of Directors
is appointed each year by GOI and includes full-time executive directors as
as well as part-time representatives of the Government; in view of the great
sensitivity of pollution aspects, GOI has also appointed a well-known environ-
mentalist to the Board. The Board of Directors meets periodically (at least
once a quarter) and is responsible for major policy decisions of the corpo-
ration. However, significant investment decisions need to be approved by
the Ministry of Petroleum and other GOI agencies. The present Chairman-cum-
Managing Director is a qualified chartered accountant who was earlier the
Finance Director. As is the case with other refineries in India, the manage-
ment of the company is experienced and capable. The refinery is well run,
using modern systems and procedures. The company's organization consists of
a refining division, a marketing division, a supply and distribution division,
and a financial division. Each of these divisions is headed by a director.
Presently, BPC has a total of about 6,000 employees, of which 1,200 are at
supervisory levels. All key staff are well qualified and adequately trained
in their fields.
2. Plant Facilities and Production Performance
5.04     The BPC refinery, located in Bombay (Maharashtra), has the capacity
to process 6 million tpy of Middle East crude of 340 API, or alternatively 5.0
million tons on the basis of a mixture of Middle East and Bombay High crude
(40  API), or about 4.6 million tpy of Bombay High crude. Currently, the refinery
processes a mixture of Middle East and Bombay High crude. The refinery facili-
ties include primary and vacuum distillation, catalytic cracking, catalytic
reforming, bitumen plant, special boiling point solvents and several treatment
units for LPG, naphtha, gasoline, jet fuel, and kerosene, as well as
facilities for steam generation, storage of crude and finished products, and
LPG and bitumen packing. The company also has two lubricating oil blending
plants, one in Bombay and the other in Calcutta.
5.05     Although the refinery is 25 years old, it is well maintained because
of a good preventive maintenance system and well-planned expansions. During
the last few years, BPC has operated its facilities close to capacity levels
for the crudes processed. The marketing division of the company is also operat-
ing satisfactorily. It has an extensive distribution network across the country
including 5 port installations, about 65 marketing depots and 4 jet fueling
stations. BPC sells its products directly to consumers as well as through a
chain of dealers and distributors. The volume of sales in FY80 was about
5 million tons, representing a 16.7% share of the total market.

1978.
c/   Adjusted from 15 months to 12 months to make it consistent with other
years.
5.07     Revenues of BPC have been increasing at 24% a year, principally
reflecting increases in prices of petroleum products. The net income for the
company has remained at about 15% of equity, reflecting the Government's
retention price system. The current ratio dropped from 1.4 in 1978 to 1.1 in
1980 but improved to 1.3 in 1981; the corporation has not had any serious
cash flow diffficulties and has met its obligations on time. The debt/
equity ratio of BPC and all other refineries in India deteriorated temporarily
al: the end of 1980/81 due to extraordinary borrowing that they had to incur
in order to compensate for delays in payments due from the Oil Coordination
Committee (OCC) under the Crude Oil Price Equalization Account. These
delays, in turn, were caused by the low liquidity situation of the refinery
sector that arose from rapid increases in imported crude prices. As noted,
in July 1981, GOI increased domestic crude prices from about US$6.1 per
barrel to about US$19 per barrel, and concurrently, it increased retail
petroleum prices by amounts necessary to cover the increased local and
imported crude prices. As delayed payments to the refineries are made, the
refinery debts are being repaid, with the situation expected to be fully
normalized by June 1982. The Company has been generating a satisfactory
level of internally generated cash, which averaged Rs 170 million per year
during the last three years. This cash generation will allow BPC to finance
a significant proportion of its investment requirements from its own resources.
The Company's dividend policy is to pay dividends at the rate of 12% of its
paid-in capital, provided that the company makes adequate profits in the
year and that these amounts are not required for reinvestment purposes.

5.08     In addition to the projects presented for Bank financing, Bharat
Petroleum has several other investment projects under implementation or consider-
ation. The more important of these projects, which will be financed primarily
by internally generated funds, will cost a total of US$106 million and are
mentioned below:
(a)  LPG - Phase I.   This project consists of the installation of joint
distribution facilities for marketing 168,000 tpy of LPG from Bombay
High associated gas by Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum.
Bharat Petroleum's market share of the project will be 84,000 tpy of
LPG and its share of investment is currently estimated at about
US$47 million equivalent. The project has been initiated recently
and is expected to be completed in 1983.
(b)  Aromatics Project.  Phase I of this project is to manufacture 61,000
tpy of benzene, 16,000 tpy of toluene and 5,000 tpy of LPG by utilizing
156,000 tpy of naphtha from its distillation unit. This phase is
estimated to cost US$16 million and has already been approved by GOI;
implementation has started recently and is expected to be completed in
early 1984. The feasibility study for the second phase of the project,
aimed at converting toluene to xylene, is under preparation.
(c)  Product Tankage.  The total cost of this project, which is also
under implementation, is estimated at around US$28 million. It
involves the execution of adequate product tankage at main install-
ations and depots to cater for emergencies and disruptions in supply;
(d)  Crude Tankage.  This project involves the construction of three crude
storage tanks, each of 75,000 tons capacity. The total cost is around
US$9 million; and
(e)  Sulfur Recovery.  This project involves installation of amine absorp-
tion of hydrogen sulfide from refinery gases and subsequent recovery
of sulfur using the Claus process to produce 5,700 tpy sulfur. Estab-
lishment of the sulfur plant will reduce the emission of sulfur-bearing
gases from 42 tpd to 14 tpd. Investment is estimated at US$6.0 million.
B. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPC)
1. Management and Organization
5.09      Hindustan Petroleum Corporation was formed in 1974 after the Government
of India acquired Esso Standard Refining Company of India Ltd., Lube India
Limited, and the marketing activities of Esso Eastern Inc. The refineries of
these companies were located at Bombay, Maharashtra. Subsequently, in 1979, HPC
acquired Caltex Oil Refining (India) Ltd, which owned a refinery founded in 1957
at Visakh, in Andhra Pradesh, and Kosangas Company, which enabled it to enter the
field of bottling, marketing and distribution of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
Having acquired these companies, the operations of HPC now include petroleum
refining in two states: manufacture of lubricating base oils, manufacturing and
blending of lubricant grease and specialities, marketing the full range of
petroleum products and related automotive accessories across the country, and
bottling, distribution and marketing of LPG.



- 25 -
5.10     The composition of the Board of Directors is similar to that of BPC,
with representatives from the Ministry of Petroleum and senior management of
the company. In addition to the two representatives of the Ministry of
Petroleum, the other members of the Board are the Chairman-cum-Managing
Director, and the three directors of Finance, Marketing and Production. The
Chairman-cum-Managing Director of the Corporation has been in his present
position since 1977. Earlier he was the Finance Director of Indian Oil
Corporation. The company's management is experienced and capable. The total
staff on HPC's payroll is 5,584.
2. Plant Facilities and Production Performance
5.11     HPC currently operates two petroleum refineries, one in Bombay with
a crude processing capacity of 3.5 million tpy and a second in Visakhapatnam
(Visakh) with a crude processing capacity of 1.5 million tpy calculated on
the basis of light Iranian crudes. In addition, HPC also has a lube refinery
in Bombay with a present capacity of 200,000 tpy. After several expansions
since their establishment in the mid-1950s, the present capacities are
significantly higher than the original capacities which were 1.25 million tpy
at the Bombay refinery, 0.67 million tpy at the Visakh refinery and 164,000
tpy for the lube refinery.
5.12     The production and sales performance of the company is summarized below:

The refinery has over the years increased the efficiency of its operations.
Even though the Bombay refinery has had to process increasing amounts of
lighter crude, which resulted in lowering effective capacity, HPC refin-
eries have been able to increase their total production.

5.14     Revenues have-increased at an average rate of over 22% per year, but
the return on equity has remained at controlled levels due to the retention
price formula. The company debt/equity ratio increased from 15/85 in 1977/78
to 56/44 in 1980/81 as a result of abnormal debt financing during 1980/81, as
explained in para 5.07 above. This situation, however, has now been corrected.
The liquidity position of the company is good and so is its overall financial
health. During the past three years, HPC's internal cash generations has
averaged a healthy Rs 220 million/year. The company's dividend policy has
been to pay dividends at a rate of 12% of its paid-in capital.
5.15      In addition to the proposed refinery expansion and conversion and the
recovery of SO  in the Bombay refinery, which are included in the Project, HPC
has a number ot projects under implementation. The names and costs of
these projects, financed mostly by internal funds and local borrowings, are
given below.

5.16    The LPG marketing project, which accounts for the largest investment,
involves provision of facilities for marketing of 84,000 tons per year of
LPG from associated gas being produced from Bombay High; these facilities
are being built jointly with BPC. The project also includes construction of
new bottling plants and storage facilities at Bombay, Bangalore and Nagpur.
Engineers India Ltd. (EIL) is providing engineering consultancy and construction
supervision for the bottling and storage facilities. In addition to the above-
mentioned projects already under implementation, HPC has in its pipeline a
US$40 million project for the recovery of additional heavy lube oil from the
refinery by propane de-asphalting of vacuum tower bottoms. This heavy
lube oil will then be phenol-extracted and dewaxed to produce an additional
37,000 tons per year of bright stock.
C. Madras Refineries Limited (MRL)
I. Management and Organization
5.17      MRL was established as a public limited company in December 1965
and is one of the two refineries in India that have foreign equity participa-
tion. The Government of India owns 74% of the shares, with the remaining
being equally distributed between National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) and
American Oil Company (AMOCO) of the US.
5.18     The Board of Directors of the company consists of nine represen-
tatives (including the- Managing Director) of the Government of India and two
each of NIOC and AMOCO. The Board meets at least five times a year. The
Board has delegated many of its functions to two subcommittees: (i) the
Technical Advisory Committee and (ii) the Executive Committee. The Technical
Advisory Committee is responsible for all major investment decisions, and the
Executive Committee for matters such as labor relations, manpower require-
ments, and other personnel-related matters. The present Chairman-cum-Managing
Director and other senior managers in the company are capable and have had
extensive experience in the Indian petroleum industry.
5.19     The financial and cost accounting systems of the corporation are
modern. MRL is in the process of completing the computerization of its
accounting system, with significant assistance from AMOCO. The company has
its own internal audit staff that reports to the Managing Director through
the Finance Director.
2. Plant Facilities and Production Performance
5.20     Madras Refinery commenced operations in 1969, with a processing
capacity of 2.5 million tpy of 340 API Darius crude (50,000 bpcd); this has
recently been increased to 2.8 million tpy. The refinery is relatively
complex, with 13 process units, including a lube oil plant. In addition,
the plant facilities include three boilers (85 tons each) and two turbo-
generators (11 MW each) to meet the steam requirements, and other auxiliary
facilities. MRL does not market its production and its products are shipped
mostly by pipeline to a bulk storage terminal owned and operated by Indian
Oil Corporation (IOC); the balance is loaded into rail cars and tank



- 28 -
trucks to be subsequently marketed by IOC.  The storage facilities at the
refinery include 4 crude tanks of 41,500 tons each and 63 other tanks for
intermediate and finished products, and a 500 ton sphere for LPG storage.
5.21      The recent production performance of MRL has been excellent with
capacity utilization at 93% in 1977/78, 100% in 1978/79, 100% in 1979/80 and
93% in 1980/81. The drop in production in 1980/81 was due to a routine main-
tenance turnaround in July 1980. In addition to maintaining a high level of
capacity utilization, MRL has also reduced its internal crude consumption and
loss from 10.5%, which was the original design, to 9.2% in 1981 or an improvement
of 14%. Considering the complexity of the refinery, the fuel and loss figures of
MRL are very good.

a/  These are underestimated as reserves have been changed to income.
5.23    Although the overall financial position of the company is sound and in
line with other companies in the refinery sector, the current ratio is low
and has worsened in the last two years. The main reason for this working
capital squeeze is the substantial cash requirements during the last two years
for the two major investments currently under implementation (see below). In



- 29 -
these years, MRL has been able to keep a low working capital level since it
has enjoyed liberal terms for the purchase of Iranian oil. As discussed in
para 9.12, however, assurances have been obtained that MRL will maintain a
minimum current ratio of 1.1 until December 1985 and 1.2 thereafter.
Long-term debt as a percentage of total capitalization has remained below
10%, which means that MRL has the capacity to borrow significant sums
for its expansion programs. According to its Articles of Association, MRL is
required to distribute as dividends 50% of its net income after taxes and
allowances for reserves. In the past several years dividend distribution
amounted to 15% of paid-in capital, as agreed mutually between the shareholders.
5.24     In addition to the expansion and conversion facilities included in
the proposed Project (para 6.07), MRL currently has two major projects
under implementation. The first is a plant to produce paraffin wax at an
estimated cost of about Rs 177.4 million (US$20.9 million). A turnkey
contract for the project has been given to Engineers India Limited (EIL) and
the project is expected to be commissioned by early 1983. The second project
is the construction of an additional storage tank for crude oil with a
capacity of 55,000 tons. The project is expected to be commissioned in
Aujgust 1982. These projects are being financed principally with internally
generated funds. These investments when completed and operational will
contribute substantially to the cash generation of the company.
D. Cochin Refineries Limited (CRL)
1. Management and Organization
5.25     Cochin Refineries Limited, incorporated in September 1963, is the
second Indian refinery company with private and foreign equity ownership.
The shares of the corporation are traded on the Bombay and Cochin stock
exchanges. Currently, 52.6% of the shares are owned by the Government of
India, 26.4% by Phillips Petroleum Company (USA), 7.1% by the Kerala State
Government, 6.6% by the Life Insurance Corporation of India, 1.0% by Unit
Trust of India, and the remaining 6.0% by the public.
5.26     The Board consists of nine directors, of which five are nominated by
GOI, two by Phillips Petroleum Company and two by other shareholders. As in
t'he case of other refinery companies, the Board must meet at least once every
quarter but on the average meets about nine times a year. The chief operating
officer of the company is the Managing Director. Unlike the other three
companies, the Managing Director's position is held by a person other than the
Chairman of the Board. Below the Managing Director, the Refinery Manager is
responsible for all departments except finance, personnel and administration,
and the company secretary. These three department managers report directly
to the Managing Director. The company has a total staff of 468, of which 110
are at the supervisory level. The Company's management and staff are capable
and experienced.



- 30 -
2. Plant Facilities and Production Performance
5.27     The refinery, which was inaugurated in September 1966, originally
had a capacity of 2.5 million tpy of crude oil. Subsequently, in 1973, the
capacity was increased to 3.3 million tpy. The plant facilities include
atmospheric and vacuum distillation, naphtha and distillate dehydrosulfurizers,
catalytic reforming, and visbreaker. The storage facilities at the refinery
consist of 5 tanks for crude oil with a total capacity of 200,000 tons,
7 tanks for intermediate products with a total capacity of 42,000 tons and
another 31 tanks for furnished products with a total capacity of 230,000
tons.
5.28     The capacity utilization of the plant has remained at about 88% in
recent years. One of the reasons for this somewhat low capacity utilization
compared to other refineries is the fact that although the refinery capacity
was originally designed for processing light Iranian crude, it has had to
process heavier crudes of several types. The refinery has been able to
maintain its fuel consumption and loss at less than 4.5%.
3. Financial Performance and Expansion Plans
5.29     A summary of the financial performance of CRL during the past four
years is shown in the table on next page. Detailed historic financial
statements are in the Project File: Reference D. As in the case with all
refineries in India, during late 1980/81, CRL incurred substantial debts in
order to compensate for delays in payments due to it by IOC and OCC. As was
explained in para 5.07, IOC and OCC faced liquidity difficulties arising
from the low crude oil prices that existed prior to July 1981. However,
amounts due to CRL are now being paid, and CRL in turn is repaying its debts.
It is expected that all debts related to the above abnormal situation will be
repaid by June 1982. As discussed in Chapter IX, agreements have been
obtained that the current ratio will be maintained above 1.1 until December
1985 and 1.2 thereafter and that the debt/equity ratio of 65/35 will be
achieved by December 31, 1987.
5.30      Under its Formation Agreement, up to July 1982 the company is
required to distribute as dividends 100% of its net income after taxes and
allowances for reserves. Thereafter, dividend payments will be set by the
Board. For the past several years it has distributed between 34% and 54% of
its paid-in capital as dividends as mutually agreed between the shareholders.
At this time there is no project in the corporate pipeline other than the
one proposed for Bank financing.

E. Auditing
5.31      The auditing requirements and procedures of all four companies
participating in the Project, which are limited public companies with
more than 50% government ownership, are similar. The company audit is
carried out at three levels. The first audit is conducted by the internal
audit staff of each company. In all cases, the audit manager reports to the
chief financial officer of the company but also has direct access to the
managing director. The scope of audit covers all activities of the company
and includes a review of the internal control of the company. The second
audit is conducted by statutory auditors (a partnership of independent
chartered accountants) appointed by the Government of India in consultation
with the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. Statutory auditors are
appointed for a period of three years, at the end of which they must be
changed. At the completion of their annual audit, the statutory auditors
express their opinion on the fairness of the financial statements. These
are included in the company's annual report. The auditing standards and
procedures followed are those laid down by the Indian Institute of Chartered
Accountants. The third audit is conducted by the Audit Board of the Office
of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. This is both a financial
and a management audit and the comments of the Audit Board are exhibited
along with the financial statements of the company.
5.32     The auditing procedures followed are sound and considered satisfactory,
since auditing procedures are thorough. Audited financial statements are
generally available six months after the close of the financial year (para 9.12).

VI. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
6.01      The main objectives of the Project are to expand and modify refining
capacity in order to reduce the imbalance between domestic demand for and
supply of petroleum products in India, and to improve the energy efficiency
of the sector. As noted, the consumption of petroleum products historically
has been characterized by a much stronger growth of middle distillates
(kerosene and diesel oil) relative to light distillates (motor gasoline and
naphtha) and fuel oils. Previous additions to refining capacity were
influenced primarily by the need to reduce to a minimum the production of
gasoline/naphtha in excess of what could be disposed of in the domestic
market as well as by the desire to minimize capital costs. These factors
resulted in the establishment of rather small refineries with very little,
if any, secondary processing facilities. However, with (i) the increasing
deficits of middle distillates in the country, and (ii) the planned invest-
ments in coal, gas and power projects designed principally to substitute for
fuel oil, GOI's planning in the refinery sector is currently directed towards
adding capacity and installing secondary processing therein to bring about a
better balance between demand and local production profiles. The additions
to capacity as well as the new capacities planned for the future include
economic-sized conversion capacities of residuals to increase the yield of
middle distillates. The proposed Project represents a major effort by GOI
for better utilization of existing capacities oriented towards production of
high-value distillates which are currently in deficit. Annex 6 provides the
existing and proposed crude and product slates for the refineries included in
the Project. The Project will also add significant petroleum-tankage and
related distribution facilities.
6.02      In addition to the proposed refinery expansions and conversion, GOI
has emphasized the need for energy conservation and pollution control measures
in the refining sector. The Project includes energy-saving investments and
measures aimed at reducing internal fuel and process heat requirements at
the four refineries (Bombay, Cochin, Madras and Visakh), which will be expan-
ded and rationalized as discussed above. A sulfur-recovery scheme at a fifth
refinery (HPC-Bombay), which will result in pollution abatement in the area,
is also a part of the Project. Finally, the Project includes energy conser-
vation and pollution control schemes in six other refineries in the country.
B. Project Description
1. Refinery Capacity Expansion and Secondary Processing Component
(i) BPC-Bombay Refinery
6.03      One of the objectives of the BPC refinery conversion scheme is to
permit the company to operate at a capacity of 6 million tpy on the basis of
processing a higher proportion of Bombay High crude and increase its diesel
oil yield. The subproject includes the following components: (a) installa-
tion of a prefractionation system and modifications to the existing crude
distillation unit to process 6 million tpy of light crude; (b) a new vacuum
distillation system of 0.79 million tpy capacity; (c) a new FCC unit (0.6
million tpy) with a gas concentration system and CO boiler to recover heat
from regenerator off-gases; (d) new LPG Merox (58,000 tpy) and gasoline



- 33 -
Merox (0.147 million tpy) treaters; (e) intermediate storage and finished
products storage (80,000 tons) facilities; and (f) additions/modifications
to utilities generation and distribution facilities, including flare system.
6.04      The facilities required for the generation and distribution of the
incremental utilities required under the Project are relatively small. The
additional steam produced from the new FCC unit's CO boiler, together with
spare capacity in the existing boilers, will be adequate for normal require-
ments after Project completion and therefore no additions to steam generation
capacity are envisaged. The present sea water cooling system will require
addition of three pumps and of offshore and onshore pipelines. With these
additions and the proposed replacement of the standby generator by one with a
750 KW rating, the cooling water system will have sufficient capacity and
reliability. Regarding power, the present supply source is the Maharashtra
State Electricity Board grid which supplies power from the Tata Power
Company's thermal station, contiguous to the refinery. Under the Project,
1.2 MW of captive power will be generated from the FCC unit's CO boiler
steam. No difficulty is anticipated in obtaining the additional 1.5 MW power
required for the expanded operations. The Tata thermal plant is installing an
additional 500 MW Bank-financed unit, which is due for completion in December
1982. Agreements have been obtained from BPC that satisfactory arrangements
will be made for timely and reliable supplies of power and water.
(ii) CRL-Cochin Refinery
6.05      The Cochin Refinery expansion/conversion subproject consists of:
(a) an increase in atmospheric distillation capacity from 3.3 million
tpy to 4.5 million tpy by addition of a desalter, increasing the height of
the fractionator and retraying the top section; (b) debottlenecking of the
existing vacuum distillation column and installation of a new vacuum column
to achieve a processing capacity of 1.9 million tpy of long residue and
to supply 1.0 million tpy of gas oil feedstock to the new FCC unit;
(c) installation of a new FCC unit of 1.0 million tpy capacity, including
gas separation facilities and a CO boiler; (d) installation of a new
0.125 million tpy amine treater for the LPG from the FCC unit, followed
by a new cracked LPG Merox unit; and (f) revamping of the bitumen unit to
0.35 million tpy capacity, to produce 0.2 million tpy of asphalt; and
(g) additional storage facilities (145,000 tons).
6.06      The crude oil receiving facilities of the refinery need to be
upgraded to meet its requirements after project completion. The oil jetty at
the Cochin port is presently capable of receiving up to 30,000 DWT tankers
and the crude oil is pumped through a 30" pipeline to the refinery. A new
jetty, approximately 1 km from the existing one and located in the approach
channel, will be constructed by the State's Cochin Port Trust; the channel
will be deepened to 35' draft initially and 40' draft ultimately, which will
enable mooring of 60,000 DWT tankers in the first phase and 115,000 DWT
tankers in the second phase of development. A submarine crude line and bunker
fuel line will connect the new jetty to the corresponding lines in the existing
jetty. The new jetty is scheduled to be commissioned in December 1983, and will
be fully owned and operated by the Cochin Port Trust. Regarding water supply,



- 34 -
the refinery has an agreement with the State Public Health Engineering Department
for the supply of 1.5 million gallons per day (mgd) of fresh water compared with
the current consumption of about 1.0 mgd. Upon completion of the Project, water
requirements will go up to about 5.0 mgd. To meet this requirement, the State
Government is currently building a pipeline from the Ramamangalam River to carry
7.0 mgd of water through a 17 km long pipeline to the refinery area. This water
pipeline is due for completion by July 1983. Regarding supply of electric power,
Cochin Refinery is entering into an agreement with the Kerala State Electricity
Board for the supply of 9.8 MVA of power from the State grid, which will be
sufficient to cover the project requirements. While Kerala State is surplus in
power and sells it to neighboring states, the current supply is liable to frequent
outages and fluctuations and frequent trippings of the main substation supply
line. As a part of the Project, the power receiving transformer stations will be
suitably modified to eliminate the problem. Furthermore, a 2.5 MW turbogenerator
set will be installed at the company to provide power for critical service.
Present steam generation capacity totals 55 tons per hour (tph). Additional
steam capacity of 80 tph in two boilers plus the CO boiler of 85 tph capacity
have been included in the Project to provide adequate capacity for the total
project requirement. The proposed arrangements for the supply of utilities
are, therefore, satisfactory. Agreements have been obtained that satisfactory
arrangements for the supply of water and power will be completed in a timely
manner.
(iii) MRL-Madras Refinery
6.07     The expansion/conversion subproject of Madras Refinery will double
its crude processing capacity to 5.6 million tpy (based on, interchangeably,
light Iranian or Bombay High crudes) and will comprise: (a) a new distillation
train (2.8 million tpy) with a corresponding vacuum unit, and Merox units for
LPG (30,000 tpy) with cracked LPG (70,000 tpy), cracked gasoline (152,000
tpy) and kerosene (0.5 million tpy); (b) a new FCC unit (0.6 million tpy) and
amine treaters for gas streams; (c) revamping of the existing bitumen and
sulfur units to increase production by about 50%; (d) additional crude,
intermediates and final products tankage (about 200,000 tons capacity); (e) a
new flare system and a new effluent treatment plant including separators;
and (f) appropriate additions to offsites and infrastructure to be integrated
with the corresponding existing facilities.
6.08     The Madras harbour is capable of receiving 80,000 DWT tankers (46
draft) and a 20 pipeline connects the port to the refinery storage tanks,
capable of 4,000 tph throughput. With the increase in crude storage capacity
from the present 195,000 tons to 360,000 tons, the crude oil receiving system
will be adequate for handling the 5.6 million tpy crude oil required by the
refinery. Regarding power supply, the existing captive generation capacity
amounts to 22 MW in two turbogenerators. The refinery power system is linked
to the State grid for import and export of power from the refinery. Present
generation of power is only about 14 MVA, as it is limited by medium- and-low-
pressure steam extraction rates; it is sufficient, however, for the current
normal running of the refinery (with a surplus 1.5-2 MW exported to the State
grid). As a part of the Project, the steam from the FCC/CO boiler, waste heat
boilers and the regular boilers will be integrated into its total power system,
and the use of pressures for process and offsites will be optimized in order to
enable the present generators to produce the full 22 MW. In addition, two new



- 35 -
low-pressure turbogenerating sets will be installed so that production of 28 MW
(against an estimated future demand of 26 MW) is assured. The refinery will
thus continue to be a net exporter of power to the State grid.
6e09     The source of water to the refinery is from the ground water system
administered by the State Government. At present, the effluent treatment
system consists of facilities for collecting all oil-bearing effluents into a
sewer basin, API separators, clariflocculators with pH adjustments and
clarifiers. Effluents are treated before they are let out into the Buckingham
Canal and then into the sea along with effluents from the nearby Madras
Fertilizers facilities. Oxidation pond overflows at the refinery exit are
monitored daily by the refinery and once a week by State Government authorities.
For the Project a separate set of facilities to provide a similar system of
API separators, new clariflocculators and clarifiers will be installed.
(iv) HPC-Visakh Refinery
6.10     The Visakh Refinery subproject scope consists of:  (a) a new atmosphere
distillation unit of 3 million tpy capacity (for processing Basrah or equivalent
crude); (b) a vacuum distillation unit of 1.65 million tpy capacity; (c) a new
FCC and gas concentration unit of 0.6 million tpy capacity; (d) a bitumen blow-
in,g unit of 0.15 million tpy of product capacity; (e) Merox treatment units for
LPG, gasoline and kerosene with sufficient processing capacity to include also
the processing of streams from the present refinery; (f) new effluent treatment
facilities; (g) expansion of utilities generation facilities (3 boilers,
additional instrument air compressor, 2 turbogenerators, 3 additional pumps for
cooling water system and a new flare; and (h) additional tankage (200,000 tons).
6.11     The present system of crude supply to the Visakh refinery is by long-
range tankers moored in the Visakh outer harbour, lightered to medium range
tankers, brought to the inner harbour oil jetty and pumped through a 36
pipeline to the refinery. The Visakh Port Trust (VPT), is presently constructing
a new jetty in the outer harbour and a 36" 8 km long pipeline (2 km to the
shore from jetty partly submarine, partly above water on trellis) linking to
the present line outside the inner harbour. The cost of the pipeline system,
estimated at Rs 67 million, will be borne by Visakh refinery and is included
in the Project. The VPT project is expected to be completed before October
1984. Currently the power requirements of the refinery are met from the
State Electricity Board grid. After the project completion, the total power
requirement will increase from 3.8 MVA to 10 MVA. Of this, about 2 MVA will
be generated as part of the Project. This power will be sufficient to
maintain critical equipment in operation in the event of power failure. The
balance will be purchased from the State grid.  Regarding fresh water supply,
present requirements of 0.5 million gallons per day (mgd) are supplied by the
Visakh Municipality from its Todipudi reservoir with a capacity of 37 mgd.
The State Government has agreed in principle to supply the additional
requirements of 0.8 mgd. Agreement has been obtained that satisfactory
arrangements will be made for adequate supplies of power and water.
(v) HPC-Sulfur Recovery Unit
6.12      The sulfur recovery subproject at the HPC-Bombay refinery will
process the combined hydrogen sulfide contained in gases recovered from



- 36 -
virgin and cracked LPG (7 tpd), from its fuels refinery and from the lube oil
hydrofinishing plant (12 tpd) of its lubes refinery. A Claus unit will be
used to recover 16 tpd of elemental sulfur. Manufacturing facilities will
include: (a) a mono-ethanol amine extraction unit for recovery of hydrogen
sulfide from the lube recovery sour gas; (b) a Claus unit for sulfur recovery;
(c) small additions to electric power distribution; (d) storage bays for
sulfur product; and (e) control room laboratory and safety systems. Utilities
required for the scheme will be provided from the existing refinery facilities.
2. Energy Efficiency and Pollution Control Component
6.13     The Energy Efficiency and Pollution Control component consists
of priority investments in several refineries in the country. The
investments proposed for improving the energy efficiency of the refineries
involve the complete replacement or modification of low-efficiency crude
distillation and cracking furnaces (to increase efficiency from about 50% to
90%) and the installation of air preheaters and waste heat boilers in other
facilities. The investments identified for this component are: (a) at Gauhati
Refinery of IOC, complete replacement of two crude distillation and cracking
furnaces; (b) at Barauni Refinery of IOC, complete replacement of five crude
distillation furnaces and one coking furnace; (c) at Gujarat Refinery of IOC,
complete replacement of six crude distillation and conversion furnaces;
(d) at Bombay Refinery of HPC, revamping or replacement of three distillation
furnaces; (e) at Bombay Refinery of BPC, revamping or replacement of four
furnaces; (f) at Visakh Refinery of HPC, revamping or replacement of four
furnaces; (g) at Madras Refinery of MRL, installation of three air preheaters;
(h) at Cochin Refinery of CRL, installation of three air preheaters; (i) at
Mathura Refinery of IOC, installation of eight air preheaters; (j) at Bongaigaon
Refinery of IOC, installation of two air preheaters; (k) at Haldia Refinery
of IOC, installation of three air preheaters; and (1) installation of sulfur
recovery units and pollution control devices. It is expected that about 90%
of the investments under these components will be for energy efficiency, and
10% for pollution control. Although the overall scope of these investments
has been identified and reviewed by Bank staff, they will be submitted to
the Bank for approval only after their viability has been established by
detailed feasibility studies currently underway and the investments have been
approved by GOI. The total cost of the energy efficiency and pollution
control component is estimated at US$118 million, of which US$30 million will
be financed by the Bank loan. Agreement has been reached that the energy
efficiency investments to be included in the Project will be approved by the
Bank based on its technical and economic viability. The selection criterion
for the pollution control investments will require that they represent the
least-cost solution to meet satisfactory environmental standards.
C. Process and Technology Selection
6.14      Based on an earlier techno-economic evaluation of the merits
of alternative secondary processing options carried out for the Gujarat
Refinery Expansion Project, GOI has adopted the FCC process for the conversion
facilities proposed at the four refineries under the Project. Although the
FCC process is generally preferred when light distillate production (i.e.,
gasoline and LPG) is to be maximized, Bank staff analysis (Project File:
Reference E) has confirmed that the choice of FCC will also be appropriate
for the Indian refinery sector, in spite of its high requirements of middle
distillates, for the reasons mentioned below.



- 37 -
6.15     Firstly, with the planned increase in Bombay High (BH) crude pro-
duction, Indian refineries will process either the lighter BH crude or its
mixture with Middle East crude, which will allow the refineries to increase
straight-run middle distillate production. Therefore, the additional middle
distillate production to be achieved by secondary processing will be signi-
ficantly lower in India than in other countries that process heavier crudes.
Secondly, the Indian diesel oil product specifications permit a lower cetane
number (CN) of 42, which enables FCC units to increase significantly their
yield of diesel oil. This 42 CN specification can be achieved even if the
diesel oil from secondary processing has a cetane number of only 32, by
blending it with straight-run diesel oil which has a much higher cetane
number. Thirdly, the LPG fraction of the light distillates is in demand in
India to replace kerosene as domestic fuel, especially in urban areas, and is
therefore a middle distillate substitute. In the above circumstances, the
choice of FCC does not result in a significant middle distillate production
sacrifice, but it still reduces the investment required for secondary processing.
The economic return for these FCCs is therefore higher than for alternate
secondary facilities, such as hydrocrackers.
6.16     GOI evaluated UOP (Universal Oil Products Co. of USA), Texaco and
Kellogg technologies for the FCC process and chose the UOP technology in view
of the higher guaranteed diesel oil yields (49% on feedstock compared to
44-45% for others) as well as the much lower license and basic engineering
fees. The UOP technology is well proven with over 150 FCC units in operation.
For LPG and distillates treatment, the generally used and proven UOP Merox
technology, has been chosen. Selection of the UOP technologies for FCC and for
LPG and distillates treatment facilities are therefore acceptable.
6.17     The sulfur recovery unit proposed at the HPC-s refinery includes
an amine treatment unit for recovery and process of hydrogen sulfide from the
liubes complex and fuel refinery LPG off-gases. The unit will use a standard
CLaus process to recover sulfur. The Claus technology will be provided by
Comprimo B.V. (Netherlands) which has proven experience with such units. HPC has
already entered into an agreement with Comprimo. The technology selected for
the sulfur recovery scheme is satisfactory.
D. Environmental Aspects
6.18     For atmospheric pollution control, there are no statutory or national
standards in India. Refinery projects engineered and built after the mid-1970s
generally follow air quality and emissions standards and practices required in
the US. Similar design standards, which are acceptable to the Bank, will be
followed for the Project. Contaminants from the refinery expansion and FCC
units include sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and particulates
(catalyst fines). All four of the units include CO boilers, and no increments
to CO contamination level are expected. Catalyst fines emission (about 1 tpd)
from suitably designed tall stacks will not pose a hazard. SO emission
from the BPC, Bombay refinery will increase from its present 2i tpd (reduced
from 49 tpd in 1975 through processing of an increasing proportion of low
sulfur Bombay High crude) to 42 tpd after the Project. However, the
refinery will establish a sulfur recovery plant which will bring down the
emission rate to 14 tpd. The Madras refinery already has a sulfur recovery
plant capable of handling additional sulfurous gases from the Project and
the present ground level concentration of 0.5 ppm SO2 is expected to



- 38 -
be maintained. Cochin and Visakh refineries will process increasing quantities
of Bombay High crude which is low in sulfur content, and no deterioration of
air quality is expected.
6.19     For liquid effluents pollution control, either the Indian Standards
Specifications or the local government standards will apply, both of which
are satisfactory. The standards relate to end-of-the-pipeline quantities,
that is, permissible quantities at the outfall point. All four of the
refineries presently treat their liquid effluents according to the applicable
standards. The existing facilities will be modified (Bharat-Bombay, Madras)
or new additional facilities will be established (Cochin, Visakh) to handle
additional effluents according to the required standards. These standards
are acceptable. Agreements have also been obtained from the refinery companies
that the project facilities will be designed, built and operated with due
regard to appropriate safety norms and ecological and environmental standards
satisfactory to the Bank.
VII. ENGINEERING AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
A. Engineering Arrangements
7.01     Engineers India Ltd. (EIL) has been selected by the Project sponsors
to provide the following services under the Project: (i) basic engineering
of all non-proprietary process plants (all except FCC, Merox and sulfur
recovery units) and al-l offsites facilities; (ii) detailed engineering
of all sections under the Project, except that of the critical sections of
the FCC and Merox units and the offsites facilities for Bharat refineries
which will be carried out in-house; (iii) procurement services for equipment
and materials including expediting of delivery, and inspection at
vendor's shops; (iv) construction supervision and management; (v) project
management services including schedule monitoring and progress reporting;
and (vi) start-up assistance. Under its licensing arrangements with the
sponsoring companies, UOP will provide: (i) basic engineering package for
the FCC and Merox plants; (ii) detailed engineering for critical sections of
the FCC units; and (iii) necessary technical assistance during engineering
construction and start-up. EIL is the largest engineering company in the
country and has considerable experience in engineering and project management
of hydrocarbon processing industries, especially refineries. Its performance
in past projects has been fully satisfactory. Based on staff appraisal of
EIL's capabilities and experience, and in view of its knowledge about local
subcontracting and site conditions, the appointment of EIL for performing the
scope of work outlined above is considered satisfactory. Contracts between
the individual project authorities and EIL have been entered into and EIL is
performing its work responsibilities satisfactorily. UOP is a leading inter-
national process development, licensing and engineering firm in the refinery
and petrochemical industries. It has successfully designed and engineered
similar refinery projects all over the world and in India. It is fully
competent to carry out its responsibility under the Project. The engineering
arrangements for the Project are, therefore, considered satisfactory.
B. Project Implementation Arrangements
7.02     EIL's Manager of Projects (Refineries), who has substantial prior
experience, will be directly responsible for implementation of the



- 39 -
Project. He will be assisted by a separate project manager for each of the
refinery projects who in turn will be assisted by a task force of core personnel
(coordinators) seconded from EILs central departments dealing with various
disciplines of engineering, procurement, construction, accounting and finance.
Under the overall supervision of the EIL project manager, the task force
personnel will be responsible for supervising the jobs pertaining to their
respective specialties. All such task force personnel are in place. During
the site construction phase, EIL will establish at the project sites a full-time
task force under a resident construction manager, who will report to the
concerned project manager. The site task force will be responsible for field
engineering, construction quality control, construction supervision, stores
management, time schedule and cost control, on a day-to-day basis until plant
start-up.
7.03     EIL has considerable experience in the management of refinery
modification and grassroots refinery projects. Notably, its responsi-
bilities in the Gujarat refinery expansion project and the new Mathura
refinery are similar to those envisaged in the current expansion and con-
version schemes. EIL-s overall corporate organization and typical project
organization is shown in Annex 7-1. EIL has been adopting this matrix type
of project implementation organization for large projects in recent years
successfully.
7.04     The organizational set up in each of the project sponsoring compan-
ies consists of a full-time company project manager who reports to
the Managing Director. These project managers have all been appointed and
are responsible for coordination among the various concerned agencies,
including the company-s technical divisions, the process licensors, EIL, the
Central and State Governments and other statutory bodies. The company project
managers will also approve engineering and construction designs, exercise
schedule and cost control, and arrange for training the operation and main-
tenance personnel. In these functions, each company project manager is assisted
by a full-time task force drawn from the refinery's functional departments.
The company project managers have been delegated adequate authority to approve
purchase and work contract awards. The individual refinery managements have
in--house higher level committees to approve award of contracts and work scope
changes beyond the delegated powers of the project manager. Decisions exceed-
ing the delegated powers of the Managing Director are provided by Board subcom-
mittees, which can meet at short notice and provide quick decisions on issues
pertaining to project execution. Each refinery will place a small resident
team at EIL-s offices to participate in, and expedite decisions concerning
engineering, procurement and works contracting.
7.05     The proposed engineering and project management arrangements, with
clearly demarcated responsibilities and procedures, are considered adequate for
expeditious and successful project implementation. The personnel deployed by
EIL and project authorities at the project management levels have the required
and relevant experience.
C. Employment and Training
7.06     The Project is expected to employ about 5,000 people during the peak
of construction in various locations, and is estimated to require a permanent
staff of 760 in the five refineries included in the Refinery Expansion and
Secondary Processing Component. No difficulties are foreseen in the availa-



- 40 -
bility of this personnel. The number of additional permanent staff required by
the refineries is relatively small since the Project involves rehabilitation,
energy efficiency, and additions to existing operations. A number of key
operations personnel of the refineries have been assigned to fill project
execution positions. Most of the training of additional operators and
maintenance crews will be carried out under existing training programs in the
refineries, which are adequate and are imparting training not only to their
own personnel but also to other hydrocarbon processing industries in India
and abroad. Nevertheless, a limited number of selected personnel will be
trained abroad in facilities similar to the ones under the Project.
D. Project Schedule
7.07     The implementation schedule for the various project components is
given in Annex 7-2. Investment approvals for all subprojects included
in the Refinery Expansion and Conversion Component were granted by GOI in
1979 and 1980, on the basis of feasibility studies prepared during that
period. These feasibility studies have been revised in October 1981 and
formal approval by GOI of the revised studies was issued in February 1982.
Contracts were entered in 1980 and early 1981 between the individual project
authorities and UOP for the purchase of technology rights and basic engineering
package of the licensed units. UOP's process packages for the individual
refinery units were received during the first half of 1981 and detailed
engineering work on these units by EIL commenced thereafter. Engineering
work by EIL on non-licensed process units and offsites commenced during the
last quarter of 1980, with the Cochin refinery work commencing earliest. The
basic engineering work is well advanced and detailed engineering is currently
underway.
7.08      The various subprojects of the Refinery Expansion and Secondary
Processing component are expected to be mechanically completed as follows:
(i) June 30, 1984 for all facilities at Cochin refinery; (ii) December 31,
1984 for all facilities at Madras and Visakh refineries; (iii) March 31, 1985
for all facilities at Bharat refinery; and (iv) September 30, 1983 for all
facilities at HPC's Bombay refinery. The energy efficiency and pollution control
components are expected to be implemented over a three-year period commencing
April 1982. The last date for submission of subprojects to the Bank is
December 31, 1982. Considering the present status of the Project, the strong
implementation arrangements and that the above schedules for individual
components incorporate 3-6 months contingency over the schedules being used
by the project sponsors, the implementation schedule is considered achievable
and reasonable.
VIII. CAPITAL COST, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A. Capital Cost Estimate
8.01     The total financing requirements of the Project, including physical
contingencies, price escalation, working capital and interest during construc-
tion are estimated at US$1,086 million equivalent (Rs 9.2 billion), of which



- 41 -
about US$468 million is in foreign exchange. The breakdown of the capital
cost by main project component is as follows: (a) US$968 million equivalent
for the Refinery Expansion and Conversion Component, including US$238 million
for the Bharat refinery, US$271 million for the Visakh refinery of HPC,
US$6.0 million for the Bombay refinery of HPC, US$265 million for the Madras
reifinery and US$188 million for the Cochin refinery; and (b) US$118 million
for the Energy Efficiency and Pollution Control component. The detailed
capital breakdown is given in Annex 8-1 and summarized below:

8.02     The base cost estimates are expressed in September 1981 prices.  The
estimates are based on: (i) UOPs basic engineering package for the FCC and
Merox units; (ii) basic engineering data generated by EIL for nonlicensed
process units and offsites; (iii) as-built costs of FCC and other units of
Gujarat and Mathura refineries, adjusted for capacities and time of implement-
ation; and (iv) EIL-s cost-data bank information on fabrication costs,
machinery and material costs, costs of utilities generation, offsites systems
and, effluents treatment systems, updated to September 1981 basis. While
estimates of the quantum of materials (plates, tubes and pipes) for process
units and some of the offsites facilities have been computed as the first
material take-off estimates, the costs of associated civil works, erection,



- 42 -
electricals and instrumentation systems have been computed as percentages of
the cost of materials, based on EIL's experience and engineering judgment to
arrive at erected plant costs. The average cost of consulting services is
estimated at US$11,000 per man-month for foreign consultants and US$1,500
per man-month for local consultants, including per diem, travel and other
reimbursable costs. A provision of 10% for physical contingencies over
the base costs is provided. Price escalation was calculated on the basis
of inflation rates both for foreign and local cost components at 11% in
1981/82, 8.5% in 1982/83, 7.5% up to 1985/86 and 6.0% thereafter.
8.03     Additional working capital requirements are estimated at US$126
million.  Interest during construction has been estimated at US$130 ;llion,
assuming (i) capitalization of interest up to the time of commissioning;
and (ii) loans of US$200 million from IBRD and US$506 million from GOI on
terms specified in paragraph below.
B. Financing Plan
8.04     The financing plan for the Project is shown below.  The detailed
financing plan for each of the sponsoring companies is given in Annex 8-2.

Total Financing             468.0       617.7      1,085.7   100
8.05     The sponsoring refinery companies will provide US$380 million
of equity financing for the Project out of their internally generated funds.
On the basis of the existing pricing mechanism, the financial projections of
the individual sponsoring companies indicate that the refineries should be
able to generate these funds during project implementation (see Chapter IX).
However, because of the Government's influence on pricing, agreement with GOI
has been reached that, should the refineries fail to earn sufficient internally
generated funds to cover the Project's financing requirements, then GOI will
provide funds to cover the financing gap as well as any cost overrun that
might develop. Furthermore, in order to ensure that petroleum prices will



- 43 -
remain at reasonable levels, agreement has been reached with the Government
that it will use a pricing mechanism that allows refinery companies, under
condition of efficient operation, to meet all their expenses, service their
debt and earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital.
8.06     The proposed  Bank loan of US$200 million equivalent will finance
18% of the Project's total financing requirements and 43% of the foreign
exchange requirements. It would be made to GOI at the standard Bank interest
rate for 20 years, including five years of grace. GOI, in turn, would onlend
the loan proceeds to the beneficiary companies under subsidiary agreements
satisfactory to the Bank for 15 years, including four years of grace, at an
interest rate of 12%, which is the onlending rate of GOI funds in Rupees for
large chemical industries. The execution of two satisfactory subsidiary loan
agreements between GOI and the beneficiary companies would be a condition of
effectiveness of the Bank loan, while the execution of the other subsidiary loan
agreements satisfactory to the Bank would be a condition of disbursements of
the relevant project components. The proposed Bank loan will be utilized as
follows: US$45 million for the BPC refinery, US$45 million for the Visakh
and Bombay refineries of Hindustan Petroleum; US$45 million for the Madras
refinery; US$35 million for the Cochin refinery; and US$30 million for the
energy efficiency and pollution control investments. GOI will provide loans
to the refineries amounting to US$506 million to complete the financing
plan for the Project. These loans will be for 15 years, including 4 years of
grace at 12% interest.
C. Procurement and Disbursement
8.07     Equipment financed by the Bank will be procured by international
competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank guidelines, except for
equipment proprietary to the process design, items whose supply is critical
to efficient project execution, and small items estimated to cost less than
US$200,000 each which may be procured through limited international tendering
from qualified suppliers from at least three countries selected from Bank
members, Switzerland and Taiwan. Procurement of Bank-financed equipment, under
other than ICB procedures, will follow Bank Guidelines. Such procurement will be
agreed upon with the Bank, and the aggregate of contracts for such equipment
will not exceed US$30 million equivalent. For purposes of bid evaluation under
ICB, qualified local suppliers will enjoy a margin of preference of 15% or the
applicable duty, whichever is the lower. The Bank loan will also be used to
finance the license and services provided by foreign and local engineering
firms. All disbursements will be fully documented. The equipment not
financed by the Bank will be procured under international or local competitive
bidding procedures, as appropriate, and which are acceptable to the Bank. Civil
works and erection services will be procured under acceptable local competitive
bidding procedures.

8.09     Of the US$200 million Bank loan, it is expected that US$90 million
will be used to finance imported equipment, US$80 million for local equipment
procured under Bank ICB, and US$30 million for local and foreign
licenses and engineering services. It is recommended that the Bank loan
would retroactively finance 10% of loan amount or US$20 million of eligible
expenditures incurred after July 1, 1981 on engineering services and down
payments on critical equipment. The Bank loan is expected to be completely
disbursed by June 30, 1986. A disbursement schedule is given in Annex 8-3.
It is based on the disbursement profile of Bank-financed chemical industry
projects, including those in India.
IX. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Revenues and Operating Costs
9.01      The financial analyses of each project component and sponsoring
companies have been carried out in nominal Rupees and by company fiscal year
(April-March). It is assumed that the expansion and conversion subprojects
at Cochin, Madras, Visakh, HPC-Bombay, and BPL-Bombay will be mechanically
completed in accordance with the schedules in para 7.08 and commissioned three
months later. The project facilities are assumed to operate at 60% capacity
utilization in the first year of operation, 80% in the second year and 90%
thereafter. Considering the relatively high capacity utilization rates
achieved by these refineries in the past and that these are expansion projects,



- 45 -
the assumed operating rates are considered achievable. The financial
projections conservatively assume no benefits or costs from the proposed
energy efficiency investments though these investments will reduce the
operating costs by substantial amounts, yet difficult to quantify, margins.
The major assumptions used in the financial analysis are detailed in Annex 9-I.
9.02      As noted, financial prices of over 80% of refinery products are
regulated by the Oil Coordination Committee (0CC) of GOI and determined on
the basis of a "Retention Price" formula that would generate for an efficient
refinery a 15% return (before tax) on fixed assets and working capital
(Annex 9-1 provides details about the Retention Price formula). In the past,
several companies have been able to earn returns of over 15% on net fixed
costs, partly because many refineries have been able to lower their fuel loss
to levels below those assumed by the OCC and retained the savings so obtained
as well as through sales of some products whose prices are not regulated.
For the analysis, financial revenues have been calculated on the conservative
basis that, at efficient operations, they will be adequate to cover the
operating costs, including depreciation, and generate 15% return on net fixed
assets and working capital.
9.03      The capital and operating costs for the subprojects were based on
tlhe satisfactory data provided in the feasibility reports prepared by the
slponsoring companies. Details of the operating costs are provided in
Annexes 9-2 to 9-5 and summarized below for 1989, the first year of full
operations for all project components.
Summary of Operating Costs of Subprojects in 1989
at 90% Capacity Utilization
(in million current Rupees)
HPC        BPC      CRL       MRL
Crude Oil Feedstock                 9,042      3,014   3,617      8,440
Other Variable Costs                   75         14      45        219
Depreciation                          190        188      146       186
Other Fixed Costs                      81         55      38         96
Total Production Costs           9,388      3,271   3,846       8,941
Financial Charges                     122        111     118        161
Total Operating Costs            9,510      3,382   3,964       9,102
Crude Oil Cost as a Percentage
of Total Production Cost        96.3%      92.1%   94.0%       94.4%
9.04      As is evident from the table above, about 95% of the operating costs
are attributed to crude oil feedstock.  While a small percentage of this crude
feedstock is consumed within the refinery during processing, most of this
crude (92-95%) is sold as petroleum products output. The average price of
crude oil used for the financial projections is Rs 1,600 per ton as of July
1981 and is expected to increase in real terms at 3% per year. The price of



- 46 -
Rs 1,600/ton is the weighted average of the prices paid for international and
domestic crudes.l/ The difference in prices paid by different companies on
account of different sources of crude oil are equalized through the Crude Oil
Price Equalization Account monitored by the Oil Coordination Committee. Should
the crude price charged to the refineries be increased, for example, by bringing
the domestic crude price to import levels, the pricing formula would allow an
increase in the company revenues accordingly, to allow the refineries to
generate the net income calculated on the above rate of return basis.
B. Financial Projections
9.05      Detailed financial statements (income statement, balance sheet and
statement of changes in financial position), have been prepared for each of the
four refinery expansion and conversion subprojects. In addition, the financial
projections for the four companies without the subprojects were prepared by the
respective companies and adjusted by the mission in accordance with the Bank's
projections on inflation and petroleum price trends. Using these two sets of
statements, consolidated financial statements with the Project were prepared
for each of the companies. The assumptions used for these projections are
presented in Annex 9-1. The financial projections for the four subprojects
are given in Annexes 9-2 to 9-5, and the consolidated financial statements
for the companies are available in the Project File: Reference F.
1. Project Financial Projections
9.06      Key data from the projected financial statements for the Project are
summarized in the table on the following page. Each of the project components
will generate significant amount of net profits and internal cash flows to
allow them, even during initial years of operation, to generate adequate
funds to service their debt. All of the subprojects will generate substantial
profits from the first year of operation. In 1986, the first full year of
operations of the subprojects of CRL, MRL and HPC, their respective net incomes
would be Rs 75 million, Rs 196 million and Rs 260 million. The BPC project
would generate Rs 99 million during its nine months of operation in 1986 and
Rs 143 million in 1987. While the net profits will go down in all cases
after the first full year of operation due to substantially increased income
taxes, net income is projected to remain satisfactory during the project
life. The high profitability of the Project is also indicated by the relatively
low (40-70%) profit breakeven points for the subprojects. Since all subprojects
will generate substantial positive cash flow from the first year of start
up, they will have major beneficial impacts on the financial situation of
the sponsoring companies, improving their liquidity as well as debt/equity
positions.
9.07      As shown in Annex 9-2 to 9-5, during the construction stage HPC
and BPC subprojects will enjoy sound financial positions, with debt/equity
ratios below 65:35. On the other hand, the MRL and CRL subprojects will have
relatively higher debt/equity financial structures during the construction
period, due principally to low equity contributions resulting from the low
1/   As of July 1981, the price of domestic crude was about US$19 per barrel
(Rs 1,182/ton), while the price of imported crude was US$34/barrel
(CIF Bombay) (Rs 2,010/ton).

internal cash flows generated by the companies. However, once the sub-
projects start operating the debt/equity ratios will improve signficantly
and by 1988 MRL and CRL will be able to reach a debt/equity ratio of about
65:35. As noted in para 9.12 below, agreement was reached that MRL and
CRL will take all action required to achieve and thereafter maintain a
65:35 debt to equity ratio by December 31, 1987. In spite of the high
leverage MRL and CRL are expected to maintain acceptable debt coverage
ratios of over 1.4.

9.09      The Project will have a major positive impact on the financial
situation of the sponsoring companies.  Net income of Bharat Petroleum, is
calculated to increase from Rs 160 million in FY82 to Rs 728 million in FY86
and cash generation from 334 million to Rs 1,119 million during the same
period; minimum debt service is calculated at 1.8 and current ratio at 1.3,
indicating comfortable liquidity situations. Madras Refinery Limited would
increase net income from Rs 47 million in 1982 to Rs 283 million in 1986, the
first year of operation. Internal cash generation would increase Rs 68 mil-
lion to Rs 492 million in the same period; minimum debt service ratio is
projected at a satisfactory level of 1.8 and current ratio at 1.1 after
1982. In the case of Hindustan Petroleum, net income is projected to increase
from Rs 145 million to Rs 498 million and internal cash generation from
Rs 297 million to Rs 984 million between FY82 and FY86; minimum debt service
ratio and current ratio are calculated at 1.5 and 1.1, respectively. Cochin
Refinery is projected to almost triple net income of Rs 47 in FY82 to Rs 127
million in FY86 and also increase cash generation from Rs 61 million to
Rs 282 million. However, the debt/equity ratio of CRL up to 1984 will be high
but will improve significantly after the Project is commissioned. Although
the debt service coverage in 1982 is extremely poor as a result of switching
from short-term borrowings to long-term loans, after 1982 this ratio is expected
to improve significantly. As noted in para 9.12, agreement has been reached
that the sponsoring companies will not take actions such as contracting new
debt if these actions will reduce the debt service coverage ratio below 1.4.
Overall, all companies are projected to improve their financial performance
significantly once the subprojects are commissioned.

C. Financial Rate of Return
9.10      The financial rates of return and the results of the sensitivity
analysis for each of the project components are presented in the table below.
Detailed financial cost and benefit streams and the assumptions used are
included in Annex 9-6.
Financial Rate of Return (%)
Visakhapatnam   Bombay    MRL    CRL
Base Case (Before Tax)                      13.5         8.9      11.6   10.6
Capacity Utilization Down 10%               11.0         6.4       9.1    8.6
9.11      The financial rates of return in real terms will range between
9-14% for the four project components and reflect the reasonable net profit
and positive cash flow generated in each case, beginning from the first year
of operation (para 9.06). Variations in capital costs, operating costs and
sales revenues will not affect the financial returns of the subprojects
because the retention price formula will compensate the refineries for any of
these variations. Therefore, no sensitivity tests on these changes are shown
in the table above. The financial returns are, however, substantially below
the economic returns (para 10.05), because the pricing formula for setting
the ex-refinery producer prices is designed to allow the refineries to earn
only a 15% return on net fixed assets and working capital, at efficient
operating conditions (para 9.02). The differential between the economic rate
of return and the financial rate of return accrues to the Government. These
financial returns, though moderate, lead to adequate cash flows to allow the
companies to meet their financial obligations and maintain a healthy financial
structure, and are considered satisfactory. In addition to ensuring a
satisfactory financial situation to the companies, the retention price
formula provides an incentive to the companies to invest in new plants. This
is achieved by a cross-subsidization between new and old plants, with the
resulting decline in the cash flow and profits of producers in their later years.
D. Financial Covenants and Reporting Requirements
9.12      Agreements have been reached with GOI and the sponsoring companies
on financial covenants that will ensure that the financing plan of the
Project is adequate and that the sponsoring companies will follow prudent
financial practices and maintain satisfactory financial positions. Agreements
sought and obtained on the Project's financing plan are discussed in paras
8.04 to 8.06. Regarding the financial position of MRL, CRL, HPC and BPC, agree-
ments have been obtained that each of them will: (i) maintain a long-term debt/
equity ratio of not greater than 65:35 except for CRL and MRL which will
maintain this ratio after 1987; (ii) maintain a current ratio of at least
1.1:1 until December 31, 1985 and 1.2:1 thereafter; (iii) not incur additional
debt in any fiscal year if by so doing the projected debt service coverage
ratio would fall below 1.4; (iv) not take any action such as prepayment of
debt or distribution of dividends, if these actions would reduce the current
ratio below 1.3; and (v) not make, during implementaion of the project, any



- 51 -
investments in fixed assets (other than the Project, the ongoing and already
planned projects, and for maintenance purposes) in excess of US$10 million for
each refinery in any year without prior approval of the Bank. The Project
sponsoring companies will submit monthly progress reports on the Project
components. Their annual audited reports will be submitted to the Bank within
six months of the ending of their fiscal year, in a form satisfactory to the
Bank.
E. Major Risks
9.13      The Project faces only limited technical risks since (i) the
technologies to be used are commercially proven and will be supported by
qualified and experienced firms; and (ii) the Project involves expansion and
rationalization of existing facilities in sites which are already developed
and with adequate infrastructure. However, the sustained performance of the
refineries at the projected operating levels will depend to a substantial
extent on the availability of adequate amounts of crude feedstock, either
from domestic sources or from imports. GOI is aware of this risk and has
taken strong measures, as discussed in Chapter II, to increase in the future
the availability of domestic crude. Marketing risks are also minimal,
since the output from the Project facilities will be principally to substitute
imports, which are currently marketed and distributed through existing
channels. Whereas the Project could face some potential financial risks if
GOI were to modify its "Retention Price" formula or to reduce the capabilities
of the refineries to generate sufficient internal cash flows to finance their
equity contribution to the Project, agreements have been reached with GOI
that it will use a pricing mechanism that will permit the companies to earn a
reasonable return on their capital (para 8.05).
X. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Introduction
10.01     The economic rate of return for each of the four expansion and
secondary processing components have been calculated separately. The economic
rate of return for the entire Project has been also calculated. The individual
investment proposals for energy efficiency will be submitted to the Bank for
approval after their detailed feasibility reports are finalized, and will
have to have satisfactory economic rates of return (para 6.13). The pollution
control investments included in the Project will be the least cost solutions
to meet agreed upon environmental standards. The economic cost and benefits
for internationally tradeable items have been determined by using the Bank's
projections of prices expected to prevail during the life of the Project
and adjusting these prices to reflect the appropriate transportation costs.
For non-tradeable items, domestic prices have been used in the economic
analysis after adjusting for taxes and duties and taking into account the
prices of their internationally traded components.
B. World Petroleum Prices and Economic Benefits
10.02    As a result of the steep rise in the price of crude oil, and other
petroleum products in the past decade, the balance-of-payment position of
less-developed oil importing countries have deteriorated significantly.
India has also been severely affected by these price increases. In spite of
the increase in domestic oil production, India will continue to be a net
importer of petroleum products. The economic analysis in this chapter



- 52 -
indicates that it will be more economical for the country to increase domestic
refinery capacity rather than to import middle distillates and other higher
value petroleum products directly since the Project will generate a high
economic rate of return.
10.03    In the analysis, the prices used for petroleum products have
been determined after comparing the historical international price relation-
ships of these products with crude oil, their projected world supply and
demand positions, and the current CIF prices in India. The economic prices
of petroleum products as of July 1981 are as follows:

Crude (Bombay High)                      269       1.06      35.7       1.04
The July 1981 prices of final products as well as crude oil have been projec-
ted to increase at 3% per year in real terms. The price of imported crude
oil (CIF Bombay) in mid-1985 is projected to be US$38.6 per barrel expressed
in 1981 US dollars. The economic price of Bombay High crude is projected at
US$40.2 per barrel, or about 4% above light Arabian crude, due to its better
quality. The diesel oil output from the Project has been valued at a price
5% lower than that in the international market in order to account for its
lower cetane number.
C. Economic Costs
10.04    The capital costs for the Project provided in Chapter VIII are
treated as the economic capital costs after appropriate adjustments for taxes
and duties. Operating cost estimates are based on the information presented
in the feasibility reports of the different project components; some of these
estimates were revised upwards after review by the Bank staff. Details of
these cost estimates are provided in Annex 10-1 and summarized below. About
95% of the total annual costs are accounted for by crude oil. As can be seen
from the figures below, capital and operating costs are small compared to the
annual operating costs and therefore the analysis includes calculation of
both internal rates of return and net present values.

10.06    All project components have very attractive economic rates of
return. These returns are high, because all these subprojects: (a) are



- 54 -
expansion projects with minimal additional investment for infrastructure; and
(b) result in the conversion of low value residual fuel oil to higher value
middle distillates which are in short supply and currently imported. As noted
before, the differences between these high economic rates of return and the
more modest financial rates of return accrue as benefits to the Government.
The analysis indicates that it is highly desirable for the country to modify
its refineries under the Project so that they can supply finished products
based on local and imported crude rather than importing the final products
directly.
E. Foreign Exchange Savings
10.07    Assuming an operating period of 12 years, the net foreign exchange
savings that will accrue to the country as a result of the Project will be
more than US$10 billion. Although part of the crude used in the Project may be
from Bombay High, for the economic analysis crude oil cost was assumed to be
an import cost since India remains a net importer of crude oil. The foreign
exchange savings from the Project would be large for the country, consider-
ing the investment required, and would help ease its trade deficit situation.
If the cost of Bombay High Crude were considered to be local, the foreign
exchange savings would be much higher.
F. Other Benefits
10.08     The Project would result in the additional employment of about
5,000 persons during the-construction phase and 760 persons once the Project
goes into production. The Project will also enable the country to increase
its reserves of petroleum products and thereby minimize risk of petroleum
supply interruptions. EIL, the local engineering firm, will get additional
valuable experience in design and implementation of large refinery projects,
which should prove beneficial for future projects that will be implemented by
the Indian refinery companies.
XI. AGREEMENTS
11.01     The following major agreements have been obtained from GOI and the
Refinery Companies.
A.  From the Government that it will:
(a) furnish to the Bank, for its review and approval, all
proposals for the Energy Efficiency component not later than
December 31, 1982 (paras 6.13, 7.09);
(b) provide or cause to be provided funds, facilities, services
and other resources necessary to complete the Project, and
cover anv cost overruns (paras 8.05, 8.06);
(c) use a pricing mechanism that allows refinery companies, under
conditions of efficient operations, to meet all their expenses,
service their debt, and earn a reasonable rate of return on
invested capital (para 8.05); and
(d) relend the proceeds of the Bank loan, in Rupees, to the
Refinery Companies with an interest rate of 12% per annum and
repayment over a period of 15 years including four years of
grace (para 8.06);



- 55 -
B.  From each of the Refinery Companies that they will:
(a)  make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank with appropriate
agencies for the provision of adequate supply of power and water,
and adequate receiving and transport infrastructure facilities
for the supply of crude oil as required to ensure the timely
availability of all such supplies (paras 6.04, 6.06, 6.09,
6.11);
(b)  ensure that the Project facilities will be designed, built
and operated with due regard to appropriate safety norms and
ecological and environmental standards satisfactory to the
Bank (para 6.19);
(c)  furnish its accounts and financial statements, duly audited,
to the Bank not later than six months after the end of each
fiscal year, as well as such information as the Bank may request
from time to time (para 9.12); and
(d) follow prudent financial practices and comply with financial
covenants as described in para 9.12.
11.02     The Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$200 million equivalent,
for 20 years, including five years of grace, at the standard interest rate.
The Bank loan would be on-lent in Rupees to the beneficiary companies at 12%
for 15 years, including four years of grace. Retroactive financing of up to
US$20 million is recommended under the loan for expenditures incurred after
July 1, 1981. The signing of two satisfactory subsidiary loan agreements
between GOI and the beneficiary companies will be conditions of effectiveness,
while the execution of the other subsidiary loan agreements satisfactory to the
Bank would be a condition of disbursements for the relevant project components
(para 8.06).

INDIA - REFINERIES RATIONALIZATION PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS AND FACTORS AFFECTING PROJECTED
CONSUMPTIONS OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS
(a) Naphtha. Naphtha is used as input in fertilizer and petro-
chemical projects. Consumption projections have been estimated on a plant
by plant basis, taking into account all fertilizer and petrochemicals plants
already erected, under construction or included in plans approved by GOI.
Naphtha consumption by these units will reach its maximum level by 1985.
(b) Motor Gasoline. Of the demand for motor gasoline, 55% is for
scooters and 2-wheelers, and 45% for automobiles. The number of private
motor vehicles is small with a significant proprotion being military and
government and company owned vehicles. Demand projections have been based
on past trends, taking into account the planned future production of gasoline
consuming vehicles in India. On this basis, low, median and high growth
rates of 3%, 3.5% and 4% per year are expected.
(c) Jet Fuel. Growth rates of 5.5%, 7.0% and 8.5% have been assumed
in the three scenarios, on the basis of past growth rates, adjusted for
various scenarios for growth of both internal and external aviation traffic.
(d)  Kerosene.   Kerosene consumption is projected to be at somewhat
lower levels than previously projected by IIP since consumers are expected
to gradually shift to other more convenient fuels. It is also expected
that a significant proprotion of total kerosene demand will be replaced by
LPG, particularly as cooking and heating fuel in urban households. Demand
for LPG would be constrained by LPG availability and is anticipated to
grow at 11% per year. The gross annual growth rates (i.e., before replace-
ment by LPG available) are assumed to be 6%, 8% and 9.5% in the three
scenarios.
(e) High Speed Diesel. Sixty percent of HSD is used in road truck
and bus transport, 26% in agriculture, 9% in rail transport and the rest
in miscellaneous sectors. Since relatively constant additions to the road
transport fleet are expected in the foreseeable future, it is anticipated
that there would be a steady growth of consumption of HSD. Indeed, since
1975/76 cons-umption has grown linearly. Therefore, in the low growth
scenario, a linear growth line has been assumed (which by 1985/86 is
equivalent to a growth rate of 6.7% per year), while for the median and
high estimates, growth rates of 9% and 10.4% respectively are expected.
(f) Light Diesel Oil. Since 1975/76, LDO consumption has grown
at a steady rate of 5% per year. Annual growth rates projected are 4.5%,
5.0%, and 5.5% per year.
(g) Fuel Oil. It is expected that fuel oil demand for general trade
will grow at a rate of 2% per year. Demand for fuel oil by the fertilizer
industry and power stations has been assessed on a plant-by-plant basis.
(h) Bitumen. A growth rate of 10% per year, based on road-building
programs in the Sixth Five-Year Plan, has been assumed.

INDIA - REFINERIES RATIONALIZATION PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Basis for Projections
The financial rates of return for the project have been calculated in
real 1981 Rupees. However, pro forma financial statements were prepared in
nominal Rupees. The exchange rate had been assumed to remain constant at
Rupees 8.50 to a US$1.00.
B. Capital Expenditure
(1981 million Rupees)
Year Ending March 31      FY81   FY82    FY83    FY84    FY85    FY86    TOTAL
Vrisakh Refinery           -       100      358     516      387       72    1,433
Bombay Refinery            -        70      323     521      436       56    1,406
Cochin Refinery           65       206      434     272      109       -    1,086
Madras Refinery            -        95      338     486      365       68    1,352
The above expenditure profiles are based on the experience of about 28
Bank/IDA financed projects in the chemical industry. Disbursements in the
first year are larger than in other projects due to the advanced stage of the
Project and the availability of retroactive financing. The disbursement
schedules do not include price escalation, interest during construction or
working capital. Price escalation for the project cost estimate was estimated
on the basis of the inflation rates projected by the Bank and adjusting these
for the Indian fiscal year (para 8.02 of text). Interest during construction
was computed on the basis of 12% interest rate and capitalization of all
interest up to the end of fiscal year 1985. From 1986, the second year of
commercial operation, the interest charges have been reflected on the income
statement as an operating expense.
C. Project Financing
Hindustan Petroleum Corporation and Bharat Petroleum Corporation
have several projects underway in addition to the Bank-financed project
components. The debt to equity ratio used for the Bank-financed project
components was assumed to be the same as for other projects in the respective
corporate project pipelines. This debt to equity ratio was determined on the
basis of the total capital expenditures by the companies and the internal
cash generation between 1981 and 1986. All equity contributions are assumed
to come from these internally generated cash flows. External debt financing
would be required to the extent that internally generated funds are not
adequate to cover the capital expenditures.
The Bank loan would be on-lent to the companies through the Government
along with the GOI loan. The loans are assumed to be for 15 years including
four years of grace, at an interest rate of 12% per year.

D. Production Build-up
HPC and MRL project components are expected to be mechanically
completed on December 31, 1984 and commissioned by April 1, 1985. CRL
project which is ahead of the others is expected to be mechanically completed
by June 30, 1984 and commissioned by October 1, 1984. Mechanical completion
for BPC is estimated by March 31, 1985 and commissioning by July 1, 1985.
Each of the project components are expected to average 60% capacity during
the first year of operation, 80% during the second and 90% thereafter.
Capacity utilization according to fiscal years is shown below:
1985    1986    1987    1988    1989
HPC Visakh                      -        60       80       90      90
BPC Bombay                      -        43       75      89       90
CRL Cochin                      28       70       88      90       90
MRL Madras                      -        60       80       90      90
The project is expected to have an economic operating life of 12 years, at
the end of which 5% of the fixed capital expenditures and 100% of working
capital is expected to be recovered.
E. Working Capital
Since this is an expansion project the additional working capital
requirements would be less than if it were a green-field project with the
same incremental capacity. The working capital requirements for 1989,
the first full year of operation for all refineries at 90% capacity (in
millions of Rupees) are:

Up to 75% of the working capital requirements can be met through short-term
debt financing and the remaining through internally generated funds. However,
in all the four subprojects, the short-term debt requirement was well below
the 75% level and no short-term debt was required after the first year of
production.
F. Revenues
Revenue computation in accordance to the "Retention Price Formula" is
illustrated below:
1. Return on Fixed Assets = (Net Fixed Assets) x 0.15
2. Return on Working Capital = (45 days of crude) x 0.15
3. Variable and Fixed Operating Cost (including depreciation)
4. Revenues = sum line I to line 3
G. Production Costs
Financial projections for all the companies are based on fixed assets
being depreciated over a 10-year period on a straight line basis. All other
operating costs excluding crude oil are expected to increase at the general
inflation rate projected for India and shown above. Crude oil prices are
assumed to increase at 3% per year in real terms.
H. Taxes
Taxation rate of 57.75% was used for the projections. This consists
of 55% of income tax and an additional surcharge of 5% of the income tax.
The companies are also allowed an investment credit of 25% of the investment
in the project. Because of relatively large profits in the first few years,
the companies utilize this credit within the first two years of operation.

INDIA - REFINERIES RATIONALIZATION PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. GENERAL
1.        The economic rates of return for the Project are calculated in real
1981 US dollars. The economic project life is assumed to be 12 years with
5% of the fixed investment being salvaged at the end of the project life.
Working capital has not been considered as an economic costs as the working
capital requirements for the project will be more than offset by the savings
in inventories of imported products. However, no credit has been given to
the project as a result of these savings.
B. BENEFITS
2.        Product prices are based on the Bank projections for crude oil
and the relative prices of various petroleum products with respect to crude
oil. These prices were adjusted upward in the case of LPG since in India it
is a kerosene substitute and has to be valued accordingly. It has been
valued higher than kerosene on a weight basis because of its higher calorific
value and thermal efficiency. The price of high speed diesel on the other
hand was lowered by 5% because of the lower cetane number diesel used in
India.

C. Capital Costs
3.           Capital cost estimates were estimated on the basis of the informa-
tion presented in the feasibility reports. The disbursement schedule for
the capital investments is shown below (in milions of 1981 US dollars).

D. Operating Costs
4.           Since the expansion project crude oil requirement would be met to
a large extent from Bombay High which is a lighter crude with a low sulphur
content, the economic value of this crude was obtained after adding a premium
to the value of the imported crude. Corresponding to a CIF price of
2254/ton for light Arabian crude, Bombay High crude economic value is estimated
at $270/ton or with a premium of 6.3% over the imported crude (on a weight
basis). The economic price of crude oil and other petroleum products are
expected to increase at 3% per year in real terms. Crude oil costs account
for over 95% of the total production costs. The remaining 5% of the costs
which include chemicals and catalysts, labor and overhead, maintenance,
general administration and others are assumed to be the same as in the
financial analysis.
E. Capacity Utilization
5.           The capacity utilization assumptions used in the economic analysis
are the same as in the financial analysis, with 60% in the first year of
operation, 80% in the second and 90% thereafter.
