BRAZIL
APPRAISAL OF A THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT (FEPASA)
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The rehabilitation of the railways has become a key element in
Brazil's economic development strategy. The railways will be a crucial factor
in helping the Government to achieve energy conservation objectives and in im-
proving the bulk transport capacity required to support the growth in agri-
cultural exports and steel production, aimed at efficient import substitu-
tion. These development efforts have intensified in light of the increases
in petroleum prices and the resulting pressure on Brazil's balance of pay-
ments.
ii.       This report appraises the Sao Paulo State and Federal Governments'
plans for the Sao Paulo State Railways, FEPASA, and concludes that they
warrant Bank support. FEPASA is important mainly on two grounds: (a) at
the country level, it is operationally inseparable from the main federal
network; and (b) at the local level, it is a vital element of the regional
economy, serving Brazil's most developed industrial centers (the Sao Paulo
area and the export corridor to Santos, Brazil's main port). In January 1975,
the Bank made a US$175.0 million loan to RFFSA, the Federal Railways of Brazil,
to support the rehabilitation, modernization, and expansion of the federal
railway system. The proposed loan to FEPASA would be a logical followup which
could lead to considerable overall benefits for both networks.
iii.      It is likely that, in the future, FEPASA and RFFSA will be mferged
into one comprehensive rail system. A special commission created in June 1975
is studyin  -he means to achieve a more efficient operational integration
between the two railroads in the State of Sao Paulo. Bank support to FEPASA
would assist in integrating the operation of the two networks, thus further
developing a national rail system.
iv.       An important objective in Bank lending would be to support improve-
ments in the operational and financial performance of FEPASA. As in the
loan to RFFSA, Bank financing of FEPASA would have strong justification in
terms of institution-building and financial rehabilitation. Bank financing
would be accompanied by a firm Program of Action to improve operational
efficiency, reduce or eliminate uneconomic services and increase tariffs as
necessary, all to reach time-phased performance targets.
v.        An additional objective in Bank financing of the FEPASA program
would be to support the Government's efforts in making urgently needed im-
provements in suburban passenger services, which are antiquated and seriously
overcrowded; such improvement is required to further discourage the growth
of private automobile use in Sao Paulo. Presently, mass transport services



- ii -
arc provided in the area by four separate entities: FEPASA, RFFSA, METRO
and the Metropolitan Bus System. While these are complementary to a large
extent, undesirable duplications may occur if adequate coordination is not
actively pursued in order to ensure the economic viability of each subsystem.
Coverriment measures to achieve such coordination are already being taken.
vi.        One of the major items in the Five-Year Investment Plan is the
package of investments related to the modernization and expansion of FEPASA's
8iiburban services. In order to ensure a satisfactory return on these sizable
investments, the Government should (a) avoid parallel investments on the
METRO line which would partly duplicate FEPASA's planned investments and,
therefore, divert part of the expected users of FEPASA's suburban lines to
METRO services: and (b) take specific measures to coordinate feeder bus lines
to the FEPASA stations. The Bank could not support FEPASA's Investment Plan
without firm assurances that the two above conditions would be met, Oral
assurances were received during appraisal from FEPASA, the State Government
of Sao Paulo, and the Federal Government. The draft legal documents for the
proposed loan, reflecting the above-mentioned conditions, were discussed with
the Brazilian delegation during negotiations and represent a firm commitment
by the Brazilian authorities.
vii.      The State Government is also developing satisfactory measures to
discourage the use of private automobiles in the center of the city and
intends to implement these measures in the near future as improvements are
irade in mass transport services. During negotiations, the State provided
the Bank with a letter outlining its complete program to restrain the growth
of automobile use in the city and its intention to carry out that program.
viii.     A loan of US$75 million is recommended to finance part of the cost
of a Five-Year (1975-1979) Investment Plan amounting to about US$1.6 billion
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$685 million. The proposed
loan would more directly support a two-year tranche (1976 and 1977) of this
Plan, with planned investments of US$762 million equivalent and a foreign
exchange component of US$367 million. The proposed loan would, therefore,
represent 9.8% of the total estimated cost of the two-year Project.
ix.       This would be the first loan to FEPASA, but the fifth Bank opera-
tion in rail transport in Brazil. In 1952 and 1953, the Bank made two
loans (65-BR and 92-BR) of US$12.5 million each to Central do Brazil, now
part of RFFSA, In 1971, Loan 786-BR (US$46.0 million) was made to RFFSA to
help finance the railway portion of the MBR (Mineracoes Brasileiras Reunidas)
iron ore project to carry 12 million tons of ore annually from the Aguas Claras
mine to the Sepetiba ocean port terminal. This project is almost completed,
and the loan is 88% disbursed. Implementation has been generally satisfactory.
In January 1975, the Bank made another loan to RFFSA (1074-BR) in an amount
of US$175 million equivalent, for major rehabilitation of the system and for
capacity increases in the form of new lines, realignments, motive power and
rolling stock, modernization of suburban services, etc. This project has
just started, and tendering is under way.



- iii -
x.        The investments proposed under the Five-Year Plan are for the
expansion of suburban services in the Sao Paulo area as mentioned above (30%);
for construction of new lines and realignments, most of them under way (26%);
for procurement of locomotives and rolling stock (21%); and for track rehabi-
litation, station and yard improvements, workshops, electrification, signal-
ling and communications, studies and technical assistance (23%).
xi.       Investments alone will not be enough to enable FEPASA to meet the
traffic demand expected in the coming years. Improvements in management,
operations and maintenance procedures are essential, and, without them, the
financial rehabilitation of the railways will not materialize. Physical
targets and financial objectives were developed and are listed in a Program
of Action, which is an essential part of the Project. A formal agreement on
this Program of Action was reached during negotiations with FEPASA, the Sao
Paulo State authorities, and the Federal Government.
xii.      The proposed loan would help finance rails, switches and permanent
way equipment; parts for the rehabilitation of freight cars; workshop, sig-
nalling and communication equipment; technical assistance; and training of
FEPASA's staff. All goods financed under the proposed loan would be acquired
on the basis of international competitive bidding, in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines on Procurement. Local bidders 1/ would be granted a margin
of preference by adding 15% (or the applicable customs duties, whichever is
lower) to the CIF value of the foreign bids. Brazilian firms are likely to
compete for most items, and, since they are often competitive in the world
market, it is possible that as much as 40% of the orders to be financed by the
Bank may be awarded locally. The local orders would be for goods with a high
indirect foreign exchange content. Therefore, actual local cost financed is
not expected to exceed US$12.0 million, or 16% of the proposed loan. Neverthe-
less, the estimated foreign exchange component of the Project considerably
exceeds the foreign financing now foreseen, including the proposed loan. The
Government will meet the difference with its own resources.
xiii.     An overall economic evaluation of all items in the Project gives
an expected rate of return of 21%. Because not all benefits could be easily
quantified, this is a conservative estimate, and a higher return can be
expected, thus underlining the economic significance of the Project.
xiv.      FEPASA's financial performance has steadily improved since its
creation in 1971 and is expected to further improve gradually as traffic
increases, tariffs are rationalized and raised, operating efficiency improves
and uneconomic services are reduced. Including subsidies for the uneconomic
services which the Government wishes to retain for social and other reasons,
the working ratio is expected to improve from 114 in 1974 to 86 in 1979 or,
excluding the subsidies, from 123 in 1974 to 96 in 1979.
1/   A local bidder is a firm (or a consortium) offering goods containing
components manufactured in Brazil and representing at least 50% of the
value of the complete goods.



- iv -
xv.       The Project would provide a suitable basis for a Bank loan to
FEPASA of US$75 million for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of
about five years.  Separate agreements will be required with the State and
Federal Governments.



BRAZIL
APPRAISAL OF A THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT (FEPASA)
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Governments of Brazil and of the State of Sao Paulo, and the
Sao Paulo State Railways (FEPASA) have asked the Bank for a loan of US$75
million equivalent to finance part of the costs of FEPASA's Five-Year Invest-
ment Plan, 1975-1979, estimated at US$1.6 billion equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component 1/ of US$685 million.  The loan would actually support a
two-year tranche (1976 and 1977) of this Plan, hereafter called the Project,
with planned investments of US$762 million equivalent and a foreign compo-
nent of US$367 million. The proposed loan would, therefore, represent
about 9.8% of the total estimated cost of the Project.
1.02      This would be the first loan to FEPASA, but the fifth Bank opera-
tion in rail transport in Brazil. In 1952 and 1953, the Bank made two loans
(65-BR and 92-BR) of US$12.5 million each to Central do Brasil, now part of
the Federal Railway System (RFFSA). These loans have been fully repaid. In
1971, Loan 786-BR (US$46 million) was made to RFFSA to help finance the railway
portion of the MBR (Mineracoes Brasileiras Reunidas) project to carry 12
million tons of iron ore annually from the Aguas Claras mine to the Sepetiba
ocean port terminal. This project is almost completed and the loan is 88%
disbursed.  Implementation has been generally satisfactory, but financial
results are below expectation because RFFSA's transport costs have increased
significantly during the last two years (largely because of the increase in
fuel costs) and more than the rates set by a formula established as part of
long-term contracts signed in 1970 between MBR and RFFSA, Means are presently
being discussed in Brazil to resolve this problem. In January 1975, the Bank
made another loan to RFFSA (1074-BR), in an amount of US$175 million equivalent,
for major rehabilitation of the system and for capacity increases in the form
of new lines, realignments, motive power and rolling stock, modernization of
suburban services, etc. This project has just started, and tendering is under
way.
1.03      In addition to FEPASA, the Brazilian railway network includes about
25,000 km of lines in the federal system, RFFSA; 935 km of lines owned and
operated by EFVM (Estrada de Ferro Vitoria a Minas), a department of a
Government mining company, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), carrying
mostly iron ore traffic; and 718 km of lines operated by five small private
1/   The foreign exchange component includes all direct and indirect foreign
exchange costs as well as the costs of materials of which Brazil is a
net importer, e.g., steel and copper.

companies.  The Federal Government has created a special commission formed by
representatives of the Ministry of Transport, the State of Sao Paulo, and
FEPASA to study means to achieve a more efficient integration between RFFSA
and FEPASA in the State of Sao Paulo.
1.04      This appraisal is based on information supplied by the Brazilian
Government, GEIPOT (Empresa Brasileira de Planejamento de Transportes), the
Government of the State of Sao Paulo, FEPASA and its consultants (MONTOR,
Brazil, associated with SOFRERAIL, France) and on the findings of three
Bank missions in June 1974 and January and April 1975, comprising Messrs.
Karman (engineer), Jones (financial analyst), and Blanc (economist), with
the Latin America and Caribbean Projects Department; Taborga (economist),
with the Transportation and Urban Projects Department; and Sander (financial
analyst), consultant. This report has been prepared by them and has been
edited by Miss Foster.
2, BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Background information on the transport sector in Brazil in general
is given in "The Transport Sector of Brazil", Report No. 571a-BR, of
December 20, 1974. This chapter contains additional information relative to
the transport sector in the State of Sao Paulo.
2,02      The State of Sao Paulo is the heart of Brazil's industrial complex,
producing 50% of manufacturing output, and is a principal agricultural State,
accounting for a quarter of the country's agricultural production, including
major export crops such as coffee, cotton and sugar. Its 18 million inhabi-
tants represent 19% of Brazil's population, and its urban population, exceeding
14 million, comprises 27% of the country's urban population. The Greater
Sao Paulo (GSP) area alone, with a population exceeding 8 million, accounts
for 15% of Brazil's total urban population. The growth of industrial activity
and population in GSP have placed a heavy strain on social and economic infra-
structure and have resulted in a decline in environmental conditions. The
most obvious indication of lagging infrastructure is the near saturation of
the urban road system.
B. Transport Sector
2.03      Unlike most great metropolitan areas of the world, the city of Sao
Paulo is not on a navigable river, nor is it situated on the coast. Rather,
it is 60 km inland over the ridge of the Serra do Mar mountain chain that
separates much of the interior of southern Brazil from the coast. The city
is located on a fertile plateau and had its beginnings as an entrepot or
gathering point for shipment of materials and merchandise between the interior
and the port of Santos. Communications have been relatively easy on the
plateau, along a fan-shaped network which converges toward Sao Paulo, but
have been more difficult across the escarpment between Sao Paulo and Santos.



- 3 -
2.04      With about 17,600 km of roads, 12,000 of which are paved, the pres-
ent state highway system in Sao Paulo is more developed than that in the
rest of Brazil. Most of the network is under the responsibility of the
State Highway Department (Departamento de Estradas de Rodagem, DER) which
also maintains federal highways by delegation of the National Highway Depart-
ment (Departamento Nacional de Estradas de Rodagem, DNER).  The operation
and maintenance of the toll highway between Sao Paulo and Santos (Via Anchieta),
as well as the ongoing construction of a new parallel expressway (Imigrantes),
is entrusted to a specially created autonomous state enterprise, Desenvolvi-
mento Rodoviario S.A. (DERSA).
2.05      Traffic counts show that total traffic has increased in recent years
at about the same rate as on the rest of the network (about 14% per year).
Because average hauls are relatively shorter than in the rest of the country
and because both the highway infrastructure and the vehicle fleet are relative-
ly more developed, road/rail competition has been even keener, and the share of
Lhe road carriers in intercity freight transport is estimated to be well above
the national average of 73%.
2.06      In addition to the Highway Departments (para. 2.04), there are, at
the Greater Sao Paulo level, a Municipal Road Department under the Municipal
Secretariat of Transport and a Municipal Secretariat of Public Works which
are responsible for constructing and maintaining urban road infrastructure
except for the Beltway, which is under DER. METRO, the enterprise responsi-
ble for the construction of the Sao Paulo subway, is controlled by the Sao
Paulo municipality, which has financed most of the existing 19-km north-south
line. This line is expected to come into full operation in 1976, after the
run-in period is completed. Meanwhile, construction of the eastern line
along the right-of-way of the RFFSA suburban line is to proceed under METRO
management.
2.07      The State of Sao Paulo owns and operates, domestically, one of
Brazil's most important airlines,VASP, and runs the state airports through
the State Aeronautical Department (DAESP). Plans are being made, along with
the recently created Federal Airport Agency (INFRAERO, in charge of airport
construction and operation throughout Brazil), for the construction of a new
international airport in the Sao Paulo area. This metropolitan airport, with
yet undefined location, would partially replace Viracopos, the present inter-
national airport, and Congonhas, the local airport, which would then cater
to restricted traffic only.
2.08  -  Sao Sebastiao and Santos, with respective annual tonnages in 1973
of 22 and 16 million, are two of the four largest ports in Brazil. Sao
Sebastiao, operated by a state concessionaire, handles mostly crude petro-
leum imports destined to Sao Paulo refineries, whereas Santos, operated by
a private concessionaire, is the most important Brazilian port for general
cargo and bulk grain. The State of Sao Paulo is interested in, and has
partial planning responsibility for, further expanding Sao Sebastiao, but
planning in Santos is completely under the control of the Federal Port Depart-
ment (DNPVN). Improvement and expansion of the Santos port, especially on the
left bank, are being carried out with the Bank's financial assistance under



- 4 -
Loan 756-BR of June 1971. Under an agreement with the Federal Government and
the State of Sao Paulo Power Company (CESP), the State Government, through an
executive committee (CENAT), is also developing plans for constructing a
navigable waterway on the Tiete and Parana rivers.
C. Transport Investments and Coordination
(i) Sao Paulo State
2.09      Transport has dominated state expenditures for fixed investment;
during the period 1969-1972, it accounted for about 40% of total investment,
For 1973 and 1974, the amount invested in transport has continued to rise
sharply (Table 1). Over 50% of this amount, which excludes municipal invest-
ments other than METRO, was devoted to highway construction and, particularly,
to the Sao Paulo-Santos Imigrantes expressway, whereas METRO accounted for
another 28%. Combined investments in rail, waterways and air transport did
not exceed 20% of the total transport investments. Although the total amount
to be invested in transportation is not likely to decrease in the near term,
the composition of the program is expected to be modified, as shown in Table 1.
While METRO will continue to absorb about US$300 million per year, or 32% of
the total, FEPASA's investments will double from US$150 million to US$300
million, increasing its share from 13% to 32% of the total investment, This
assumes that, with the completion of the first phase of the Imigrantes Highway
and the reexamination of sectoral priorities, the highway share of the total
investment is expected to decrease from about 52% to 32%.
2.10      In the past, transport coordination has been poor among the various
modal agencies or at the metropolitan level among the numerous institutions
involved. Highway planning, for instance, has so far ignored railways and
their potential role. This is not believed to have resulted in major misuse
of funds because (a) road construction in recent years has barely kept pace
with the rapidly growing traffic and (b) only a small portion of this traffic
could have been economically diverted to railways had they been more competi-
tive. However, because large investments are now being contemplated for
railways and will continue to be made in highways, especially in high density
corridors, intermodal coordination and transport integration are becoming
urgent.
2.11      Excluding the urban transport problem dealt with separately, the
need for a careful intermodal coordination arises in the following two areas:
(a)  The Campinas-Sao Paulo-Santos corridor, where about 75%
of total transport investments will be concentrated and
where better rail/road integration is needed;
(b)  The western part of the State, with three railway lines
and three roads running parallel to each other and competing
for the same cargo, resulting in an uneconomic underutilization
of the existing transport capacity (para. 5.12). Intermodal



- 5 -
planning is even more important now that a fourth high-capacity
roadway - the extension of the Castelo Branco expressway - and
a navigable waterway (Tiete-Parana) are being planned in the area.
This calls for stronger and more integrated transport planning at the state
level and the undertaking of a Transport Master Plan for the State of Sao
Paulo. The new State Secretary of Transport has indicated his intention of
achieving these objectives and conducting a Transport Master Plan under terms
of reference agreed with the Bank, and the preparation of a program of action,
in consultation with the Bank, for implementing the recommendations of this
Plan, is a covenant in the legal documents (Annex 1).
(ii) Metroyolitan Sao Paulo
2.12      Very little urban transport coordination has taken place in Sao
Paulo up to now. As late as December 1974, there were three virtually
independent suburban rail operations 1/, while investments in METRO were
being independently conceived at the risk of duplication. Bus operations
were under the control of the state (intermunicipal services) and of indivi-
dual municipalities which operated their own bus companies and/or licensed
private operators. The only element of transport coordination actively con-
sidered at that time was that of bus feeder services to METRO stations.
This was made possible by the control that the Municipality of Sao Paulo had
over both services and was well short of the metropolitan transport needs.
2.13      Dependence upon public transport is strong in Sao Paulo, due to the
low rate of car ownership, which, in turn, reflects the fact that about 65%
of the total households in the area of influence of FEPASA have a monthly
income below US$310. (Table 2 shows income projections for 1980.) The outlook
for the future, even at somewhat smaller urban growth rates than those observed
in the past, indicates that mass transport will remain the only alternative for
the majority of the population of the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area.
2.14      One important step toward achieving integrated planning and coordi-
nation of metropolitan transport has been the creation of the State Secretariat
of Metropolitan Affairs and two related bodies:
(a) CODEGRAN, a deliberative body with state and municipal
representation; and
(b) EMPLASA, which will be an enterprise specializing in
metropolitan planning (Annex 2).
2.15      The Secretariat of Metropolitan Affairs (Annex 2) will implement
measures, agreed during negotiations, to ensure:
1/   RFFSA's Santos Jundiai and Central do Brazil, and FEPASA.  However, the
first two are now integrated.



-6-
(a) coordination of all future investments in mass transport;
in particular, avoidance of duplicating investments such as
unjustified METRO lines;
(b) setting up of appropriate bus feeder lines in FEPASA's
area of iinfluence, no later than December 31, 1977;
(c) operational integration of FEPASA and RFFSA suburban
services, along the lines of the program agreed upon by FEPASA
and RFFSA and approved by the Ministry of Transport in October 1974;
(d) coordination and possible operational integration with
METRO, no later than December 31, 1979; and
(e) implementation of a unified fare system, no later than December 31,
1979.
The implementation of these tasks will be the responsibility of the Sao Paulo
Urban Transport Company (ETUSP) to be created in 1976 (Annex 3),
2.16      The State Government is also developing satisfactory measures to
discourage the use of private automobiles in the center of the city, and
Intends to implement these measures in the near future as improvements are
made in mass transport services. These measures (Annex 3), although impor-
tant for improving urban transport in the Metropolitan area of the Greater
Sao Paulo, would increase expected traffic levels on FEPASA lines only margin-
ally because these lines serve low income people who are not (and will not be
in the medium term) able to own cars (para. 2.13). The doubling of the gas-
oline price over the last two years and the closing of some downtown streets
to automobile traffic have already discouraged automobile use. During nego-
tiations, the State provided the Bank with a letter outlining its complete
program to restrain the growth of automobile use in the city and its inten-
tion to carry out that program (Appendix 1 to Annex 3).
3. THE FEPASA RAILWAYS
A.   Organization, Management and Staff
3.01      FEPASA was created in 1971 by the merger of five separate railways.
Three (Sorocabana, Araraquara and Sao Paulo-Minas) were state companies
converted in 1969 into "Sociedades Anonimas" (or corporations), and the
other two (Paulista and Mogiana) were "Empresas de Economia Mixta". From
a legal point of view, the Paulista railway absorbed the other four, chang-
ing its name into Ferrovia Paulista, S,A. (FEPASA). The State of Sao Paulo
owns more than 95% of FEPASA's shares.
3.02      FEPASA is managed by a Board of eight Directors selected by the
General Assembly of the State of Sao Paulo and, currently, all FEPASA high
level staff. The Chairman of the Board is the President of FEPASA and the



other seven members are heads of the Technical, Financial, Administrative,
Commercial, Personnel, Operations, and Public Relations Departments. Board
recommendations related to investments, tariffs, credit, etc. have to be
approved, in turn, by the State Secretaries of Transport, Economy and Plan-
ning, and Finance, and by the State Governor. Following the change of Gov-
ernment on March 15, 1975, the President and several Directors were replaced
and the organization of FEPASA was slightly changed (Annex 4). The new manage-
ment seems capable and dedicated, and comprises experienced railwaymen as well
as senior officials from the private sector. The President himself has a
background of long experience with both FEPASA and RFFSA.
3.03      Operationally, FEPASA is divided into seven regions, under local
"Superintendentes" appointed by the President. These regions are not
related to the previous individual railways, which probably accounts for
the remarkably rapid integration of the system. The Federal Government is
seeking a further integration of the national rail network, and solutions to
this problem are being investigated by a special committee. Recommendations
are expected in late 1975, but it will not be until 1977 that a final decision
will be reached by the Ministry of Transport. A merger would finalize the
integration of rail transport in the State, especially in the Sao Paulo-Santos
corridor and in the Sao Paulo suburban area. In the meantime, however, measures
for operational integration agreed between FEPASA and RFFSA, and approved by
the Minister of Transport in 1974, are already being undertaken. They will
be further extended when the above committee concludes its study. Also, the
Federal Government is providing financial support to both FEPASA and RFFSA
to achieve coordinated development objectives.
3.04      Staff numbers in FEPASA decreased sharply from 35,851 in 1971 to
26,036 in 1974 (plus some staff retained under contract bringing the total to
about 27,500) and are expected to stabilize around 28,000 in 1979. Due to
the high demand for skilled personnel in the industrial centers of the State
(Sao Paulo, Santos, Campinas, etc.), FEPASA is losing a number of qualified
employees each year, which lowers the average quality of the remaining staff.
Of particular concern is the decline in workshop staff by about 20% (1,000
people) in 1974. Salary structures will be reviewed by FEPASA on the basis
of an 18-month study started in April 1975. A revised manpower policy should
be established by end 1976; this was discussed and agreed upon during negotia-
tions. Such a policy should contemplate salary increases for skilled workers
in short supply and measures to compensate for the scarcity of other personnel,
such as, inter alia, more extensive reliance on mechanized track maintenance,
where manpower savings are usually very significant.
3.05      Some 12,000 staff members of FEPASA (principally former employees
of the Paulista and Mogiana lines which were merged into FEPASA) belong to
unions. Most of the remaining FEPASA staff constitute public employees
who are not allowed to form unions, although new employees hired under the
general labor code (not public employees) are permitted to become union
members. There have been no labor disputes in recent years.

B.   Railway Property
3.06      The total length of the FEPASA network is 5,307 route-km, as follows:
Single      Double
Total     track        track      Electrified  Non-Electrified
Meter gauge          3,660      3,520        140           705             2,955
Broad gauge (1.60 m)1,647       1,603         44           491             1,156
5,307     5,123        184         1,196             4,111
Alignments are often difficult, with sharp curves and steep gradients, but
the main bottlenecks are being eased by realignments in progress. The track
is generally in poor to fair condition due to past limited investments in
renewals. Signalling varies widely over the system, from simple "entry orders",
where traffic is light, to the most elaborate two-way CTC (Central Traffic
Control) on some high-density suburban lines. Overall, it is adequate,
but improvements are needed locally. Telecommunication facilities are
generally satisfactory.
3.07      FEPASA has a fleet of 481 locomotives, 306 meter gauge and 175
broad gauge. Of the total, 76 meter gauge and 79 broad gauge locomotives are
electric, and the rest are diesel. Locomotive utilization is fairly good:
about 6,900 km per month. There are 39 electric locomotives with between
24 and 54 years of service and 80 diesel locomotives with between 17 and 27
years of service, earmarked for scrapping up to 1979. The remainder of the
fleet is homogeneous, made up of two brands for the electric and three for
the diesel locomotives, which provides for standardized maintenance procedures
and spare parts. Availability, which is low at 71% for diesels and at 74% for
electrics, is expected to improve in the future as a result of the scrapping of
the over-aged units (to be replaced by about 200 new units up to 1979) and also
by providing the workshops with an increased stock of basic spares and subassem-
blies, to be installed with minimum immobilization. By 1979, FEPASA is ex-
pected to have 170 electric and 394 diesel locomotives, about 17% more in
number and 48% more in total power than in 1974. By then, the average horse-
power per unit will have increased from the present 2,350 (electric) and 1,175
(diesel) to 3,000 (electric) and 1,520 (diesel), which will provide for more
efficient operations.
3.08      FEPASA's fleet of freight cars for commercial service totals about
15,600, two-thirds of which are meter gauge. In addition, about 1,000 cars
are used for FEPASA's own needs and about 1,300 cars (mainly for petroleum
products) are privately owned. Th- availability of the broad gauge stock
is reasonable at 90% but low for thie meter gauge cars at only 80%. Utiliza-
tion is poor at less than 1,100 km per car-month. This is due, in part, to
the obsolescence of the fleet. FEPASA plans to scrap about 4,300 and
modernize about 6,100 freight cars up to 1979. With the purchase of about
4.750 new cars, the commercial fleet would be around 16,000 units in 1979.
With the expected increase in productivity per freight car (para. 3.11),



- 9 -
this should be adequate for the 1979 traffic because this 2.6% increase in
number would be accompanied by an average 5.5% increase in unit capacity,
giving an overall 8.2% increase in total available capacity.
3,09      FEPASA provides passenger services both for intercity traffic and
for the suburban area of Greater Sao Paulo. The number of passenger coaches
for intercity traffic, 525 metric and 393 broad gauge, is more than adequate
for present and expected traffic. By contrast, the level of service on the
70-km meter gauge suburban network is totally inadequate. Track capacity
is fully utilized, partly because of antiquated signalling; trains are over-
crowded during peak hours; level crossings are a major cause of accidents and
casualties, etc. Only 125,000 passengers are transported each working day,
while the potential demand in the expanded area of influence is substantially
higher. Under the Project, significant investments are to be made, and other
measures are to be implemented in order to upgrade FEPASA's suburban services
(paras. 4.05 and 5.07).
3.10      Presently, five main workshops are used for the overhaul of loco-
motives and rolling stock: Sorocaba, Campinas, Jundiai, Rio Claro and
Araraquara. This number is to be reduced to three by 1980/81: Sorocaba
will take care of all rolling stock for the meter gauge network, Rio Claro
will take care of the broad gauge network, and a new workshop is to be built
in Boa Vista for the overhaul of all electric and diesel locomotives of
both gauges. In addition, FEPASA presently has 12 smaller workshops, to
be reduced to about six in the coming years. In general, workshop
equipment is antiquated and will be modernized under the Project. Workshop
productivity is also hampered by the lack of qualified personnel (para. 3.04).
C.   Productivity of Operations
3.11      General operating statistics are given in Table 3.  Overall pro-
ductivity of FEPASA has improved since it was established: 208,000 traffic
units per employee in 1972; 253,000 in 1974. There is room for further
improvement because the relatively modest present level is the result of
two main factors: the large amount of less-than-carload (LCL) traffic and
the excessive turnaround time of freight cars. LCL traffic is more economic-
ally transported by road, and FEPASA's cost of transporting it is substantially
higher than the corresponding revenues. In addition, about 20% of the freight
car fleet is used for LCL traffic and would be several times more productive
if used for other transport. The turnaround time of freight cars is high
(9.5 days in 1974), partly because demurrage charges are so low that, in many
cases, the freight cars are used as storage facilities by the shippers all over
the system and mainly in the port of Santos. 1/ Measures to overcome these
problems are proposed in paragraph 6.07. The quality of the service offered
1/   Also, the average turnaround time of freight cars in international
traffic with Bolivia is 60 days. The Bolivian Railways are short of
rolling stock and use Brazilian cars for local traffic.



- 10 -
to shippers is not very good, and means to improve it are being investigated
as part of a technical assistance program in train and station operations
presently under way (para. 4.05).
D.   Uneconomic Lines and Services
3.12      Over the past ten years, a great effort was made to eliminate low
density lines. Table 4 shows that, between 1964 and 1971 (the year in which
FEPASA was created) the aggregate length of the five parent companies decreased
from 6,532 km to 5,254, a reduction of 1,278 km or 20%. The present length of
the system is 5,307 km. Several uneconomic lines could, and should, be closed
in the years to come, but it is not expected that this measure would have a
significant impact on FEPASAts operations. It would be more important to
rationalize some services, such as converting intercity passenger trains with
low occupancy into mixed trains or even eliminating such services entirely on
sections where a parallel bus service exists or could be created. A study of
uneconomic lines and services is included in the Transport Master Plan Study,
to be conducted by the State Secretary of Transport (Annex 1). Measures to
be taken by FEPASA for implementing the recommendations of the study are given
in Part B of the Program of Action (Annex 5).
4. THE PLAN AND THE PROJECT
A.   The Five-Year Investment Plan, 1975-1979
4.01      With the help of consultants MONTOR (Brazil) and SOFRERAIL (France),
FEPASA has prepared a Five-Year Investment Plan covering the period 1975-1979.
The total amount of investments under the Plan is about Cr$ (75) 12.5 bil-
lion, or US$1,563 million, including physical and price contingencies,
with a foreign exchange component of about US$685 million equivalent, or about
44%. The major components of the Plan are investments for suburban services
(30%), new lines and realignments (26%), rolling stock (21%), and permanent
way (8%). Details of the planned investments are given in Table 5.
4.02      FEPASA's Investment Plan includes Cr$ 2,943.6 million (US$368 mil-
lion) for improving suburban passenger services. Including contingencies,
investments in suburban services will total US$470 million. These investments
will make possible the integration of all suburDan rail services in the
city into one single system. The resulting integrated suburban rail network
(Map IBRD 11573) serves the current high density area of Sao Paulo, From
this area, radial corridors to the north and southeast (Santos Jundiai),
east (Central do Brazil), and northwest and southwest (FEPASA) complete the
system. The simultaneous upgrading of all suburban services, together with
the provision of services through downtown and the availability of bus feeder
services, eventually with integrated fares, will increase urban rail passenger
traffic and will greatly alleviate the present transport situation.
4.03      In its present form, the Investment Plan is the result of a care-
T'ul examination by the Bank of all main components of a previous Plan sub-
mitted by FEPASA, which contained several items with marginal economic



- 11 -
justification. Some of these items were deleted altogether, while alterna-
tive solutions at a lower cost were found for others. Three important invest-
ments are conditional upon future studies paras. 5.08 and 5.10); this was
agreed during negotiations. The present Investment Plan meets the needs of
FEPASA for the next five years, based upon realistic traffic forecasts and
rcasonable improvements in operating efficiency. It was agreed during nego-
tiations that any further "major" revision of the Investment Plan would be
done in consultation with the Bank. For this purpose, a "major" revision is
considered to be an increase of more than 20% in real terms on the cost of
any item in the Investment Plan, the inclusion of new civil works costing
more than US$10 million, or the procurement of equipment of a single type
costing more than US$2 million in any given year.
B.   The Project and the Program of Action
4.04      The Project consists of a two-year tranche, 1976 and 1977, of the
Five-Year Investment Plan and amounts to about Cr$(75) 6.1 billion or
US$762 million, including physical and price contingencies, with a foreign
exchange component of about US$367 million, or about 48%. It covers the same
mix of investments as the Plan, roughly in the same proportions. Details of
the Project are given in Table 6.
4.05      The main objectives of the investments in the Project are:  (a) to
provide the very densely populated suburban area of Sao Paulo with a more
adequate, more efficient and expanded commuter rail service; (b) to complete
construction of about 700 km of new lines and realignments, some of them
started more than five years ago but not completed for lack of funds; (c)
to add about 65 locomotives and 1,800 freight cars to the rolling stock fleet
and to modernize about 2,600 freight cars which still have a useful life;
(d) to rehabilitate and partly renew about 700 km of track, replace 300
switches and provide the permanent way department with mechanized maintenance
equipment; (e) to improve various stations, yards and workshops; (f) to renew
about 300 km of overhead wire and electrify 86 km of line; (g) to install
211 km of centralized traffic control (CTC) and replace about 1,800 km of
telephone lines and (h) to fund feasibility, final engineering and other
studies in preparation of future investments. The Project also contemplates
an increased training program for FEPASA's personnel and includes a sizable
element of technical assistance in the fields of project management and
control, train and station operations, permanent way, marketing, management
information and data processing, and personnel management. It is supported
by a Program of Action (para. 4.07). A summary of the main items of the
Project and of the proposed loan is given below (US$1.00 = Cr$ 8.00):

4.06      Physical contingencies have been individually estimated for each
item of the Project and vary between 0%, when the quantities of goods are
well defined, to more than 20% for some civil works. The average physical
contingency allowance is 6.3%. Price contingencies in US dollars have
been treated on the same basis for local and foreign costs because it is the
practice of the Brazilian Government to devalue the cruzeiro frequently in
order to maintain a constant relationship between Brazilian and external
prices. Price contingencies were based on cost increases for civil works
and equipment estimated, respectively, at 14% and 10% for 1976 and at 12%
and 8% for 1977 to 1979. The average price contingency allowance is about
18.8% over the mid-1975 estimated base price plus physical contingencies.
4.07      Investments alone will not be enough to enable FEPASA to meet the
traffic demand expected in the coming years. Improvements in management,
operations, maintenance procedures, etc., are essential, and, without them,
the financial rehabilitation of the railways will not materialize. Physical
targets, financial objectives, and other measures to be taken by FEPASA were
developed and are listed in the Program of Action (Annex 5), on which formal
agreement was reached during negotiations.
C.   The Proposed Loan
4.08      As mentioned in paragraph 4.04, the foreign exchange component of
the Project cost is estimated at about US$367 million equivalent. In order
to help implement the very high priority investments contemplated and to lend
the Bank's support to improved railway management, operations, planning and



- 13 -
finances, a loan of US$75.0 million, or 9.8% of the total cost of the Project,
is proposed. The proposed loan would supplement other financing arrangements
made and being sought (para. 6.11).
4.09      As shown in detail in Tables 6 and 7 and in Annex 6, the proposed
loan would help finance the following investments: US$23.2 million for rails,
switches and permanent way equipment; US$14.0 million for the modernization
of 60 electric locomotives and about 2,600 freight cars; US$6.8 million for
new lines and realignments; US$5.0 million for workshop equipment; and the
balance for miscellaneous investments in suburban services, station and yard
equipment, signalling and telecommunications, and technical assistance.
Investments in suburban services are the major item in the Project but
represent only about 5% of the proposed loan. This is because financing has
already been arranged for most of the related investments while other items
for suburban services are not suitable for international competitive bidding.
4.10      The proposed loan includes partial financing for the following three
types of studies (Annex 7, para. 1): (a) feasibility and engineering studies
for railway transport facilities in the FEPASA systems including those iden-
tified by the Transport Master Plan; (b) a study of the Boa Vista Workshop,
to become FEPASA's main locomotive workshop in the future; and (c) electrifica-
tion studies. The proposed loan would also support FEPASA's training program
(formal local training and fellowships abroad for selected personnel) and an
extensive program of technical assistance estimated at about 646 man-months
(Annex 7, para. 2), Of the latter, it is proposed to finance retroactively
the expenditures incurred by FEPASA since April 1975 for two programs of
particular importance: train and station operations, and management informa-
tion and data processing. Total retroactive payments would not exceed
US$300,000 equivalent. Terms of reference for technical assistance would be
agreed with the Bank, and the selection of consulting firms would be made
according to usual Bank procedures.
D.   Execution, Procurement and Disbursement
4.11      With technical assistance and given adequate financial resources,
the Project could be implemented in a satisfactory and timely manner. FEPASA's
management is considered capable, and it utilizes external aid whenever needed.
All new construction and part of the track renewals are, or will be, contracted
with local firms, under FEPASA's close supervision. Only a small portion of
the investments contained in the Project are to be carried out directly by
FEPASA personnel, so that limitations due to lack of implementation capacity
by FEPASA are not expected.
4.12      All goods financed under the proposed loan would be acquired on
the basis of international competitive bidding, in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines on Procurement. Local bidders 1/ would be granted a margin of
t/   A local bidder is a firm (or a consortium) offering goods containing
components manufactured in Brazil and representing at least 50% of the
value of the complete goods,



- 14 -
preference by adding 15% (or the applicable customs duties, whichever is
lower) to the CIF value of foreign bids. Brazilian firms are likely to com-
pete for most items, and, since they are often competitive in the world
market, it is possible that as much as 40% of the orders may be awarded
locally. The local cost of orders placed in Brazil is not expected to exceed
US$12.0 million or 16% of the proposed loan, because domestic production of
the goods to be financed by the Bank includes a substantial portion of in-
direct foreign exchange costs. Nevertheless, the estimated foreign exchange
component of the Project considerably exceeds the foreign financing now fore-
seen, including the proposed loan. The Government will meet the difference
with its own resources. Brazil is a member of ALALC, the Latin American Free
Trade Association, but preferential trade agreements are not applicable in
the case of FEPASA because it is exempt from duties on imported equipment.
4.13      For imported goods, disbursements would be made on the basis of
CIF costs. For bids won by local suppliers, disbursements would be made on
the basis of 100% of ex-factory costs. The Bank would also finance 65% (the
estimated foreign exchange component) of the total cost of technical assist-
ance. Annex 8 gives the estimated schedule of disbursements. Cost estimates
are based on recent quotations obtained for similar goods under international
competitive bidding. If any savings result from favorable prices in compe-
titive bidding, the corresponding savings in the loan account would be used
to finance additional but similar project items subject to review and agreement
with the Bank.
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   Traffic Forecasts
5.01      The rapid growth of the Sao Paulo economy in recent years has not
been accompanied by a corresponding growth of rail transport. While Sao
Paulo's gross product, which represents 35% of Brazil's GDP, grew at 10.1%
between 1968 and 1972 and intercity road traffic grew at about 14%, rail
freight and intercity passenger transport actually decreased by 1% and 9%,
respectively, during the same period. This was generally due to the very
strong competition of road transport, which is estimated to have increased
its share to about 90% of total transport in the State.
5.02      Since 1972, the recovery of rail freight transport has been strong,
with toR-km up 6% in 1973 and 19% in 1974. This resulted from increases in
industrial and agricultural products well suited for rail transport, such as
petroleum products, fertilizer, cement, limestone, clinker, sugar, wheat,
corn and meal. As the table below indicates, this trend is expected to
continue in the future with the share of these 20 typical products increasing
from 87% to 95% of total ton-km. Overall ton-km rail traffic is expected to
grow about 10% per year until 1979.

4,058   100.0      6-562      100.0       10.1
5.03      These forecasts are based on a deta-iled product-by-product analysis
summarized in Table 8 and Annex 9. Although it was not possible to correlate
the evolution of rail traffic with that of regional production, the pro-
jections are in line and up to date with expected industrial and agricultural
developments in the State of Sao Paulo. The large increase in rail trans-
port of industrial products is the combined result of (a) a much larger
participation of the railroad in medium and long distance shipments of a
few buWlk products particularly suitable for rail transport-and (b) the
expected growth of the production and consumption levels of these products.
The main 1979 transport flows will result from the following:
(a)  COSIPA's steel production expected increase from about
1.5 million tons in 1974 to 3.5 million tons in 1979
will require rail transport of about 5 million tons of
combined inputs and outputs in the Santos-Sao Paulo
corridor.
(b)  The recently completed Paulinia refinery is scheduled to
ship about 3 million tons of refined products from its
railway terminal to main distribution centers in the
hinterland of the state, Brasilia, and the states of
Mato Grosso and Goias.
(c)  Santos imports about 75% of Brazil's inputs for fertilizer
production, and Sao Paulo produces and consumes more ferti-
lizer than any other state. By 1979, rail shipments to
the interior should represent about 60% of total state
consumption, or 2.4 million tons.
(d)  Sao Paulo produces and exports about half of Brazil's sugar.
It plans to export 2.5 million tons by 1980, which will be
transported mostly by rail to the Santos Port.
5.04      The forecasts are compatible with the transport capacity of an
upgraded and modernized FEPASA system and are, to a large extent, insensitive
to rail tariff variations since 80 to 90% of the 1979 traffic will consist



- 16 -
of bulk industrial and agricultural products, which the railroad can carry
on medium and long hauls at tariffs above long-run marginal costs but below
truck rates. Traffic of other commodities is expected to decline in absolute
and relative terms. This is a rather conservative assumption that may prove
invalid if FEPASA is able, through a strong marketing effort and with the
implementation of the Plan, to effectively compete with trucking for these
goods.
5.05      A continuing decrease in intercity passenger traffic, albeit at a
slower rate than in the past, is expected during the next years due to the
very strong competition of bus and air transport which provide faster, more
comfortable and more reliable service. Except in limited cases, intercity
passenger traffic cannot at present be served economically by rail because
passenger numbers are small and the geometry of the line and condition of
the track do not permit the speeds that would make rail transport competi-
tive with other modes. Total intercity passenger traffic is expected to
decrease about 5% per year up to 1979 (Table 9).
B.   Cost Benefit Analysis
(i) Methodology.
5.06      The economic evaluation focuses on the Investment Plan globally
and on particular items whenever possible. For evaluation purposes, the
items in the Plan were grouped into the following four categories: (a)
suburban services! (b) new railway infrastructure in the greater Sao Paulo
area excluding (a); (c) other new lines and realignments; and (d) the
rehabilitation and modernization program. These categories are evaluated
separately in the following paragraphs, and, from the results, an overall
evaluation of the Plan is derived (para. 5.15). The items which are
subjected to further review (Annex 10), have been excluded from the economic
evaluation for lack of appropriate cost benefit data, although there is
enough evidence at this stage to support their tentative inclusion in the
Plan.
(ii) Economic Evaluation of Categories
(a) Suburban Passenger Services
5.07      The analysis of alternative means to solve the mass transport
problem of Sao Paulo indicates that FEPASA's planned investments in its
suburban services are the least cost solution to the problem. FEPASA's
Investment Plan includes Cr$ 2,943.6 million (US$368 million) for investment
in suburban services (Table 5). Tee much needed improvements to these ser-
vices require heavy initial investments such as broadening the gauge from
1.00 m to 1.60 m to integrate them with RFFSA's suburban lines, doubling
some sections and improving signalling to increase line capacity, building
new stations and modernizing existing ones, adding new rolling stock, etc.
The magnitude of these investments is commensurate with the needs for mass
transport in Sao Paulo, and the area of influence of FEPASA in particular,



- 17 -
since passenger traffic on FEPASA's lines will increase over five times from
present levels by 1985. The economic evaluation quantifies the following
benefits (Annex 11):
(1) economic operating cost savings between bus and rail;
(2) time savings due to higher commercial speeds over alternative
bus transport;
(3) system benefits from th'e integration of FEPASA and RFFSA
suburban services (increase in average trip length);
(4) avoidance of greater urban congestion which would further
increase bus operating costs.
In addition, important benefits have not been quantified: (a) institution
building toward complete metropolitan transport coordination; (b) more inten-
sive and efficient use of the existing bus fleet; and (c) avoidance of addi-
tional air pollution from buses and cars. On the basis of quantified benefits
alone, the rate of return of the project is 21.4%. A 15% increase in costs
would reduce it to 18.6%. A risk analysis, taking into account the variability
of costs and benefits, shows that the probability of a rate of return exceeding
13% is 90%.
(b) New Railway Infrastructure in the Sao Paulo Area
5.08      Widening the gauge in the Serra section of-the Sao Paulo-Santos
corridor, building the southwest portion of the Sao Paulo rail ring between
Jurubatuba and Maua, and developing a large railway yard near the ring are
three important and critical transport investments in the Sao Paulo area.
The widening of Jurubatuba-Samarita would increase the capacity and safety of
rail transport in the Sao Paulo-Santos corridor by providing an alternative
to the RFFSA rack railroad which is expected to reach saturation by the end
of the decade. The rail ring would connect the main industrial area of
Sao Paulo to the existing rail network. It would thus provide an alternative
to trucking for many of the automotive and manufacturing plants of the area,
and it would also constitute a bypass for the long distance traffic between
Belo Horizonte and Rio de Janeiro, on the one hand, and the Santos industrial
zones, on the other. The railway lines going through the center of the city
would therefore be freed of freight trains, and would service only the
suburban passenger traffic. These two investments appear well justified, and,
because the Brazilian Government attaches high priority to them, they are
included in the National Five-Year Development Plan (see Appraisal Report
570a-BR) and financed partly by federal funds (Table 10). The yard is needed
for (a) classification of railroad cars originating or destined to the Sao
Paulo area and (b) transshipment operations between rail and road carriers.
However, the size of the yard and the timing of its construction should be
based on, and await the results of, a detailed transport operation plan in
the Sao Paulo area, to be carried out as part of the Technical Assistance
Program (Annexes 7 and 10) and the Transport Master Plan (Annex 1).



- 18 -
5.09      Potential rail traffic in this area is important and benefits to
be derived, although sufficient to justify these investments, will accrue more
or less rapidly depending upon traffic buildup (Annex 12). It is therefore
important to ensure that an optimal allocation of freight traffic between the
rail and road carriers is reached at an early stage in this heavily travelled
corridor. Measures to this effect are stated in paragraph 2.11.
(c) Other New Lines and Realignments (Annex 12)
5.10      In addition to the above, eight line investments are included in
the Plan, of which six are realignments, one is a new link (Juquia-Cajati),
and one is a major track rehabilitation and upgrading work (Mayrink-
Evangelista de Souza). The economic case for the new realignment between
Helvetia and Sorocaba and the upgrading of Mayrink-Evangelista de Souza,
together constituting an alternative north-south link between Campinas and
Santos, bypassing Sao Paulo, is not clear, and they are therefore included
only tentatively in the Plan. The economic validity of this route should
be studied among other possible routes as part of the Transport Master Plan
and agreed with the Bank before construction starts (Annex 10). The remaining
investments were started several years ago, before FEPASA was incorporated,
and their construction lagged because of fund shortages. Although some of
them may not have been economically justified initially, they are now at an
advanced stage, and the First Year Return on the remaining investments is
satisfactory, ranging from 10% to 40%. Their early completion is therefore
justified and recommended.
(d) The Rehabilitation and Modernization Program
5.11      Catering to the 1979 forecast traffic, 62% higher than in 1974,
will not only require a large increase in transport capacity but also an
important rehabilitation and renewal of the existing railway plant and equip-
ment, which have received little attention in the past. Total savings in
1979 are expected to reach US$34 million, yielding a 16% rate of return.
Because of the sensitivity of such results to variations in key factors such
as cost increases, truck costs and traffic forecasts, a probability analysis
was performed (Annex 13). Results show that there is an 80% chance of having
a rate of return between 10 and 33% and a 75% chance of having a rate of
return above 15%. The program is therefore well justified globally, and a
detailed analysis of its components shows that they are individually justified
with the exception mentioned in the following paragraph and discussed in more
detail in Annex 10.
5.12      Track rehabilitation is an important component of the Program.  It
consists mostly of improving track condition by replacing rails, ties, and
switches, and by performing minor infrastructure works. The work contemplated
appears well justified on the basis of current and future traffic, except
in two cases, i.e., the Sao Jose do Rio Preto-Santa Fe and the Adamantina-
Panorama sections, where traffic is very light and the costs of track rehab-
ilitation seem to outweigh the expected benefits. Undertaking these renewal
works should await and be conditional upon, the results of the Transport



_ 19 -
Master Plan (Annex 1). Meanwhile, no works should be carried out beyond
those needed to keep the line open to traffic.  This was agreed upon during
negotiations.
5.13      The locomotive and rolling stock acquisition program is the most
important element of the modernization program. It is designed both to renew
and to expand the existing car and locomotive fleet. The analysis (Annex 13)
was based on the existing inventory at the end of 1974, the age of the exist-
ing fleet, traffic increases, and both the current and future operating
characteristics. As a result of this reassessment, it appears that the
number of freight cars FEPASA intends to purchase over the 1975-1979 period
is adequate, provided measures are taken to reduce the daily average number
of FEPASA wagons outside the FEPASA system from 1,400 to 1,050; this problem
will need to be carefully reviewed. Because of this factor and of the uncer-
tainty attached to other parameters of the analysis, it was agreed during
negotiations that new orders for freight cars should be based on a revised
plan to be discussed and agreed with the Bank. The total number of locomotives
to be procured is also adequate, but the composition of the acquisition prog-
ram should be re.viewed without delay by the consultants working on train and
station operations.
5.14      Othet ittas of the program, such as the electrification of high
density seetibbb, tBK installation of CTC and the construction of yards are
necessary to imptove the efficiency of raii operations and lower operating
costs.-
(iii)  Ovetail Economic Evaluation
5.15      An overall economic evaluation of the plan based on a probabilistic
approach gives the following results. The expected rate of return is 21%.
There is 90% probability of having a rate of return above 18%. The risk
analysis is tmde by consolidating the costs and benefits of the various
categories of the Plan as indicated in Annex 14. The categories combined
have little or no interaction so that no double counting of benefits results.
6. FINANCES
A.   Accounts, Budget and Audit
(i) Accounts
6.01      FEPASA's financial reporting system works well; detailed state-
ments are prepared promptly each month. The schedule of expenses is well
suited for cost analysis purposes, and the collection of operating stat-
istics is being expanded to make it more suitable for this purpose. However,
no depreciation is charged in the accounts, and, except for a revaluation of
some minor assets several years ago, assets are stated at historical values.



- 20 -
Agreement was obtained during negotiations that a revaluation of depreciable
assets will be carried out by the end of 1976 and that depreciation will be
charged based on the revalued figures in 1977 and thereafter.
(ii)  Buet
6.02      FEPASA has annual revenue and capital budgets which are approved
by its Board of Directors. It receives financial support from the State
Government and, in 1975, will also receive support from the Federal Gov-
ernment for its Investment Plan. 'Such support is, of course, subject to
approval by the respective levels of Government.
(iii) Audit
6.03      As required under Loan 756-BR, FEPASA's accounts are audited by
an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank (at present SOTECAUD, a
Brazilian firm). Agreement was obtained during negotiations that independent
auditors will be retained in the future to provide an audit report acceptable
to the Bank within four months of the end of FEPASA's fiscal year.
B.   Present Financial Position
6.04      Since FEPASA was established in 1971, it has operated at a loss,
although the losses have been declining in current, and even more in real,
terms.  The working ratio 1/ improved from 158 in 1972 to 123 in 1974, ex-
cluding the Government subsidy, and from 139 to 114, including the subsidy
(Table 11). Each year, the State Government pays FEPASA 60% of the costs
of maintaining permanent way and security installations (based on the aver-
age of the preceding three years). These improvements were accomplished
principally by increasing freight rates by 40% in real terms between 1972
and 1.974 and by traffic growth. At the same time, personnel costs in-.
creased 11% per employee between 1972 and 1974 in real terms. The effect
of this increase was largely offset by a 9% reduction in staff numbers
during this period.
6.05      Operating deficits have been met out of the State Government
treasury as have funds for FEPASA's debt service payments and capital
investments.
6.06      FEPASA balance sheets for the years ended December 31, 1972
through 1974 are given in Table 12.  Except for the fact that accounts
receivable and payable were somewhat high, reflecting the tendency to
delay the payment of bills in an inflationary environment, the working
capital position was reasonable at the end of 1974. Spare parts inven-
tories were rather high, but part e; the inventory is made up of mate-
rials to be used to carry out the Investment Plan. The inventory is
1/   Since no depreciation is charged in the accounts, no operating ratio
was calculated.



- 21 -
expected to be reduced to a more reasonable level in the future because
of better inventory control, standardization of locomotives, etc. Long-
term debt amounted to Cr$ 1.9 billion (US$250 million) at the end of
1974, of which Cr$ 1.4 billion (US$190 million) represented obligations
in foreign currencies. At the end of 1974, debt amounted to 31% of total
capitalization.
C.   Tariffs and Costs
6.07      Freight rates were increased considerably in 1973 and 1974 in
real terms and averaged Cr$ 0.1086 (US41.05) per ton-km in 1974. The
level of freight rates is fairly high relative to trucking rates in the
area and probably cannot be increased (except to offset inflation) until
services are improved. Freight rates on goods other than those for export
carry a 10% surcharge which goes to the Ministry of Labor for social pur-
poses. Agreement was obtained during negotiations that the Federal Government
will neutralize the effect of the surcharge on FEPASA's competitive position
by January 1, 1977. Freight revenues, in most cases, cover long-run variable
costs and make some contribution to fixed costs. In the case of less-than-
carload traffic, however, long-run variable costs are four times freight
revenue. Agreement was obtained during negotiations that this traffic will
be phased out (probably by increasing tariffs) since it is much more suitable
for trucks. Demurrage charges will also be carefully reviewed to reduce the
number of railway wagons off-line (para. 3.11). For suburban passenger
services, fares are slightly below variable costs; on intercity passenger
services, long-run variable costs are more than double receipts. A more
detailed discussion of tariffs and costs is given in Annex 15. Steps to be
taken (tariff studies and rate revisions, studies of uneconomic services) and
targets to be achieved (operating improvements, financial targets, etc.) are
given in the Program of Action, Annex 5, which was agreed during negotiations.
D.   Future Prospects
6.08      Assumptions used in making financial forecasts are given in Annex 16.
Based on the traffic forecasts (Chapter 5), a forecast of operating revenues
and expenses was prepared for the years 1975 through 1979 in 1975 Cr$. Allow-
ance was made for increases in fuel prices and the costs of other materials,
increases in personnel remuneration averaging 15% in real terms (although
increases would be concentrated among skilled workers) and depreciation of
replaceable assets based on current replacement costs. No increases were
assumed in freight rate levels, but the 10% surcharge now levied on certain
rates was deemed to be received by FEPASA beginning in 1977 (para. 6.07). No
increases were assumed in intercity passenger fares, but an increase in sub-
urban fares was assumed in 1978 (when the new unit trains come into service),
sufficient to cover long-run variable costs.
6.09      As part of its projected study of uneconomic services (para, 3.12),
FEPASA should consider means of reducing its intercity passenger services,
which are, for the most part, uneconomic. Until these services can be phased
out, they will have to be subsidized, since passenger fares can probably not



- 22 -
be increased enough to cover avoidable costs. During negotiations, the State
Government agreed to study FEPASA's uneconomic services (as part of the
Transport Master Plan) by September 30, 1977, and FEPASA agreed to use the
studies as a basis for reducing or eliminating such services by December 31,
1977. The State and Federal Governments also agreed that, where uneconomic
services are retained (or where tariffs are set) for social or other reasons,
the Governments would extend their subsidy system by the end of 1977 to cover
the difference between the avoidable costs and the tariffs for such services.
It was assumed in the financial forecasts that the subsidy system would be
extended to intercity passenger services also by the end of 1977. Agreement
was also obtained during negotiations that freight rates and passenger fares
would be increased to cover at least long-run variable costs by end-1979.
6.10      The revenue and expense forecasts are given in Table 13 and are
summarized below:

charge for depreciation will be required starting in 1977.
(a) After Government subsidy
(b) Without Government subsidy
The large improvement in the working and operating ratios in 1977 is due to
the integration of the 10% surcharge into FEPASA's revenues. It is expected
that the ratios should improve steadily as traffic increases and operations
become more efficient. The operating ratio (after Government subsidy) should
reach 100 in about 1981.
6.11      A preliminary cash flow and financing plan is given in Table 10 and
summarized on page 23 following. Since project items extend into 1979, the
financing plan was made to cover the entire Five-Year Investment Plan period.
The financing plan depends to a considerable extent on Government contributions.
The Federal Government intends to provide financial support for specific items
of FEPASA's Investment Plan in which it has a special interest (Table 10), and
this was confirmed during negotiations. Projected foreign loans (Annex 17)
account for about one-third of investment costs, whereas the foreign exchange
component is about 45%. FEPASA intends to meet the possible foreign exchange
gap either by arranging additional foreign financing or by obtaining cruzeiros



- 23 -
from the Government and converting them to foreign currency. During negotia-
tions, agreement was reached with the State and Federal Governments that they
would provide funds or arrange financing to execute the Project satisfactorily
and in a timely manner.
6.12      Forecast balance sheets for FEPASA were prepared for the years
ending December 31, 1975 through 1979 (Table 12).  By the end of 1979,
the working capital position should be strong, reflecting some reduction
in spare parts and material inventories. The debt equity ratio, based
on the financing included in the financing plan, should be about 40/60,
although this ratio may be reduced slightly after the revaluation of fixed
assets. On the other hand, the ratio may rise if additional financing is
obtained for the Investment Plan. In order that FEPASA can achieve fi-
nancial self-sufficiency within a reasonable time period, a limit should
be placed on the amount of such borrowing.  Agreement was reached during
negotiations that, from 1977, when FEPASA's depreciable fixed assets are

THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT (FEPASA)
State Transport Coordination
In order to improve overall transport coordination and integration
in the State of Sao Paulo, the State Secretary of Transport undertakes:
1.   To carry out, with the help of consultants acceptable to the
Bank and in close collaboration with GEIPOT and other Federal
and State Transport Agencies (FEPASA, RFFSA, DNER, DER,
DERSA, and DNPVN), a Transport Master Plan covering the
State and all bordering areas relevant as transport generation
zones. This Master Plan will be started not later than
March 31, 1976, under terms of reference agreed with
the Bank. It will focus on:
a.   Coordination of rail and road investments, and
integration of rail and road freight services in
the State and, particularly, in the Campinas-Sao
Paulo and Sao Paulo-Santos corridors;
b.   Transport policies and their impact on traffic
allocation between competitive modes; and
co  Reduction of uneconomic rail services such as low
density lines and stations, interior passenger service
and LCL traffic. A tentative list of the sections
to be considered is given in the Program of Action,
Annex 5, page 2.
This Master Plan Study should be appropriately phased and
articulated with all related transport studies such as:
Railway Marketing and Operations (Annex 7), GEIPOT Transport
Plans for Main Products, and DNER's Study on Road User
Charges. The consultants are expected to produce:
a.   No later than January 31, 1977, a time-phased
schedule for major future transport investments in
the area considered, based on economic priorities;
b.   No later than January 31, 1977, precise recommendations
about specific policies and measures necessary to
ensure that freight traffic is allocated optimally
between rail and road, particularly in the Sao Paulo
corridors. These recommendations may relate to, but
should not be limited to: location decisions for

cargo terminals and silos; policy concerning the
construction of industrial rail sidings; road
transport regulation and taxation; organization of
multimodal and intermodal transport services
including piggy-back and container operations; and
c.   No later than June 30, 1977, a program of closure
and reduction of uneconomic rail lines and services
with its related financial and economic impacts on
both FEPASA and the community.
2.   Based on the above recommendations, to submit and discuss
with the Bank, no later than three months after the
consultant's recommendations are issued, a precise program
of action and a calendar of execution.

Secretariat of Metropolitan Affairs
Introduction                       I
1.        During the appraisal of this project, the Bank and Brazilian officials
from FEPASA, the Federal Ministry of Transport, the State Secretaries of
Planning, Transport, and Metropolitan Affairs, and the Mayor of Sao Paulo
agreed that the following measures are needed to ensure the economic viability
of FEPASA's investments in suburban services.
(a) coordination of all future investments in mass transport in the
Metropolitan Area of Sao Paulo in order to avoid duplications that
could result in an inefficient use of resources;
(b) setting up of bus feeder lines in FEPASA's corridor;
(c) operational integration of FEPASA and RFFSA suburban services in
Sao Paulo;
(d) coordination and possible operational integration with METRO, in-
cluding unified fares.
Secretariat for Metropolitan Affairs
2.        One important step toward achieving integrated planning and coor-
dination of Metropolitan Transport, in addition to sanitation, water supply
and any other matters of interest to CODEGRAN (para. 3 below), has been the
creation of the State Secretariat of Metropolitan Affairs. Under the office
of the Secretary is EMPLASA (Empresa Metropolitana de Planejamento de Sao
Paulo), which has the same planning and coordinating function as those of
GEGRAN prior to the creation of the Secretriat. EMPLASA is divided into
committees for transport, water supply, sanitation, and land use. These
committees will generate alternative solutions for consideration and approval
by CODEGRAN.
3.        CODEGRAN (Conselho Deliberativo do Grande Sao Paulo) will be a de-
cision-making and deliberative body attached to the Secretariat of Metropoli-
tan Affairs. It will be formed by:
(a) the State Secretary of Metropolitan Affairs (Chairman);
(b) the State Secretary of Transport;
(c) the State Secretary of Public Works;



ANNEX 2
Page 2
(d) the State Secretary for Economic Affairs and Planning;
(e) a representative of the Mayor of Sao Paulo; and
(f) a representative of the other municipalities of Metropolitan Sao
Paulo.
4.        CODEGRAN's decisions will have the character of (a) recommendations
to the State Government concerning the areas defined as being of Metropolitan
interest; and (b) decisions to be executed by relevant State agencies referring
to the implementation of specific programs and projects, based on alternatives
proposed by any of its members.
5.        CODEGRAN is expected to be installed soon and is to be the Metro-
politan instrument that will clear decisions related to the integration of
Metropolitan Transport and the avoidance of duplication of investments, the
two main issues of the Third Railway Project. In particular, construction of
new METRO lines will need approval by a majority vote in CODEGRAN. Since the
State controls four of the six votes, the State will be in control of all
Metropolitan decisions, and, since FEPASA is owned by the State Government,
CODEGRAN seems an adequate mechanism to ensure that mass transport investments
in the Metropolitan area will not be in conflict with those made by FEPASA.

Metropolitan Transport Coordination
A.   Urban Transport Company
1.        The Empresa de Transportes Urbanos de Sao Paulo (ETUSP), to be
created in 1976, will be responsible for planning, coordination and overall
management of all urban public transport as well as cargo terminals in the
Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area. It will operate under the State Secretariat
of Transport with technical guidelines provided by the Federal Metropolitan
Transport Company (FMTC) (to begin operations in September 1975 under the
Federal Ministry of Transport) and will implement mass transport programs
cleared by CODEGRAN; FMTC and CODEGRAN will also clear the use of Federal
and State funds allocated to the Sao Paulo Urban Transport Company.
B.   Allocation of Responsibilities
2.        The Sao Paulo ETUSP, in turn, would have three wholly owned subsidi-
aries for:
(a) mass rail transport, involving the operation of an integrated system
made of FEPASA's and RFFSA's suburban services and METRO; 1/
(b) bus transport, in charge of bus operations 2/ in the Metropolitan Area
including bus feeder services for the mass rail transport system, to
be performed by a mostly privately owned fleet on a service contract
basis; and
(c) cargo terminals, responsible for the relocation and operation of
cargo terminals in the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area with a view
toward decreasing the congestion induced by commercial vehicles.
C.   Implementation
3.        All three subsidiaries of ETUSP will initiate operations in 1978.
Work programs will be devised by consultants to be hired by the State of Sao
Paulo and with terms of reference to be agreed with the Bank.
1/   In 1978, majority ownership of METRO will have been transferred to the
State through a stock purchase agreement.
2/   Service contracts with private and municipal operators will be set up.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
4.        A system of integrated passenger fares for the metropolitan transport
system will be introduced in late 1979.
D.   Car Restraint Measures
5.        In a concerted effort to discourage private automobile traffic while
significantly increasing the capacity and level of service of the public trans-
port system, CODEGRAN will attempt to approve, as soon as possible, a policy
including a set of car restraint measures that will reach full force in 1978.
Some of the important measures being considered by the Government, and which
are satisfactory, are:
(a) Freezing the supply of off-street parking in the Central Business
District (CBD).
(b) Reducing on-street parking via strict enforcement of current parking
regulations.
(c) Increasing parking dues in the CBD,
(d) Operating all buses in the CBD and access corridors on bus lanes not
open to other traffic (specialized signalization giving right of way
to buses is contemplated for a later stage).
(e) Curbing taxi traffic by an increase in fares and licenses to operate
in the CBD and an increase in vehicle standards for new taxis which,
together, will reduce by more than a third the number of taxis in
the area over the next five years by simple attrition. This goal,
however, will be studied further to ensure that it will not stimu-
late private car usage.
(f) as new cargo terminals become operational, limiting loading and
unloading in the CBD to off-peak hours;
(g)  recommending to the Federal Government to increase allocations
and alter the distribution of the single tax on liquid and gaseous
lubricants and fuels and the single highway tax;
(h) postponing the construction of new expressways in the Metropolitan
Area.
This was confirmed by a letter dated July 28, 1975, sent by the
State Secretary of Transport to the Bank (Appendix 1 to this Annex).

Mr. Robert Skillings
IBRD
Washington, D.C.                               OF. STS. 195/75
Dear Mr. Skillings:
Implementation of the Greater Sao Paulo Metropolitan Planning and
Administration System established by Federal Supplementary Law No. 14 of
June 8, 1973 is going ahead steadily if slowly.
Subsequent to proclamation of State Supplementary Law No. 94 of
May 29, 1974, the present Administration set up the Secretariat of State for
Metropolitan Affairs, and in Decree No. 6111 of May 5, 1975 issued the regula-
tions governing the powers and functions of the agencies and entities involved.
As IBRD is aware, the nerve center of the System is the Greater
Sao Paulo Advisory Council (CODEGRAN), which has not yet been officially
sworn in owing to the fact that, except for the delegate representing the
capital, no other municipal representative has been designated.
Nevertheless, in order to gain time, the other members of CODEGRAN
have been meeting when possible and have already reached a number of pre-
liminary understandings.
At the most recent of these meetings, I submitted for consideration
a proposal (I attach a copy) setting out a number of measures designed to
restrict the use of private transport in the downtown area of Sao Paulo city.
The members of CODEGRAN, including the municipal representative for
the capital, are reviewing the proposal at present. I expect that, as soon
as the Council meets formally, which should be within the next few days, the
proposal will be approved, possibly with some amendments.
I wish to call IBRD's attention to the fact that the restrictive
measures recommended have either been introduced already, are in the process
of being introduced, or are being given very close study.



ANNEX 3
Appendix 1
Page 2
As part of a program to improve traffic flow along Sao Paulo's
main transportation corridors, the City Council has set aside special lanes
for buses. An experiment with these lanes along 4 km of Avenida Paulista
has been successful, the operating speed of buses having increased from 17
to 25 km per hour, Projects have been developed and are now being introduced
on three other traffic corridors - Consolacao-Reboucas, Eastern Radial and
Rangel Pestana-Celso Garcia; seven additional projects are in the final stages
of preparation.
As regards the question of preference for bus traffic, a number
of studies are being made jointly by the Secretariat for Metropolitan Affairs
and the Municipal Secretariat for Transportation to ascertain the feasibility
of special bus lanes linking the downtown and southwest areas of the city,
Discouragement of the use of taxis, another strongly recommended
restrictive measure, was begun more than two years ago; no new taxi licenses
have been issued and several fare increases have been authorized as part of
the program to make this service less accessible.
On the negative side of the picture, although projects are ready
for a system of municipal expressways, actual construction work has not been
programmed.
The measures described in sections 3 and 5 of my proposal will be
studied as a matter of urgency.
Yours, etc.

RESOLUTION PROPOSED TO CODEGRAN
WHEREAS constant problems of traffic congestion in the downtown
area of the city of Sao Paulo are aggravated at rush hours by the use of
private automobiles as a means of transportation between place of residence
and place of work, and vice versa;
WHEREAS these problems cannot be lessened by better use of the
existing road network, which is now operating at almost full capacity after
recent traffic engineering modifications;
WHEREAS the construction of new roadways designed to meet a
spontaneously generated, erratic demand would be inappropriate, as well as
fiuLancially, and above all socially, impracticable;
WHEREAS, in view of the current fuel crisis, there is a need to
discourage the use of private automobiles; and
WHEREAS, finally, it is necessary to revitalize the Sao Paulo
downtown area, the deterioration of which is partly due to intense vehicle
traffic and consequent atmospheric and noise pollution;
NOW THEREFORE the Greater Sao Paulo Advisory Council, in exercise
of its powers, RESOLVES:
To approve a policy of restriction on the use of private transport
in the downtown area of Sao Paulo city, and to base that policy on adoption
of the measures set out below, which are recommended to the agencies having
jurisdiction in such matters in those districts:
1.   To set aside special traffic lanes for the use of buses.  This
measure, requiring almost no investment except in monitoring and control,
increases the efficiency of the bus transportation system by increasing
operating speed, a factor which reduces travel time accordingly and allows
fuller use of the bus fleet, with corresponding improvements in freqtency,
schedules and reliability. This measure should be introduced gradually on
all main traffic arteries in the metropolitan region, especially those serving
the downtown areas of Sao Paulo.
2,   To give preference to bus traffic travelling on special bus-traffic
lanes by prohibiting access of automobiles to those lanes, by building road-
ways for the exclusive use of buses. by following shorter and more rational
itineraries invo lving one-way szreets and prohibitions against turning, or by
introducing spe-iai signa 'bJg sy temns giviIng priori-zy to bus traffic.



ANNEX 3
Appendix 1
Page 4
3.   To reformulate parking policies for downtown Sao Paulo, by dis-
couraging the provision of new parking facilities unless on the basis of
detailed studies of traffic patterns and land use, and by fostering high turn-
over in existing parking facilities with heavy charges for longer periods,
Rapid journeys for service purposes should still be possible since the need
for them will not disappear over the short term, given the functions which
the city center still performs even today.
4.        To discourage the use of taxis by not granting new taxi-operating
licenses and by utilizing fare increases to make taxi services less access-
ible, The underlying idea here is to impose a more rational use of this form
of transport, or, in other words to make the use of the taxi something excep-
tional.
5.        To propose that the Federal Government increase allocations and
alter its distribution of the single tax on liquid and gaseous lubricants
and fuels and the single highway tax as a means of releasing funds for invest-
ment in urban transport systems in metropolitan areas. It is necessary to
recognize the impossibility of solving urban traffic problems with the funds
now available, which come mainly from state and municipal budgets.
6.   To postpone construction of motor expressways, which imply a
fundamental acceptance of, and support for, the use of the automobile as a
means of urban transport. An exception could be made for an urban ring road
or beltway and solutions to possible problems in connecting a traffic thruway
with the existing urban network.

(i) rationalize and reduce uneconomic services in order
to minimize costs;
(ii) present a request to the relevant State and/or Fed-
eral authorities in order to eliminate uneconomic
services; and
(iii) should such request be denied, request from the
State and/or Federal authorities a financial com-
pensation covering the difference between the rev-
enues from such services and the corresponding
avoidable costs. The lines to be studied should
include but not necessarily be limited to the following:
Entroncamento - Pinhalzinho
Pres, Prudente - Pres. Epitacio
Pres. Prudente - Euclides da Cunha
Itaici - Piracicaba
Mogi-Mirim - Sapucai

C.   Tariffs
FEPASA, with the assistance of consultants, will carry out a
study of a revised tariff structure for its freight and passenger serv-
ices (interior and suburban) based on long-run variable costs and compe-
tition. This revised tariff structure will be introduced by the end of
1976, except in special cases where lower tariffs imposed by State and/or
Federal authorities are supplemented by specific contributions under the
normalization program.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
D.   Demurrage Charges
1,   Cost Study
By January 1, 1976, FEPASA will present to the Ministry of Trans-
port a memorandum outlining the daily costs of the main types of freight
cars. These costs will be calculated on the basis of depreciation and in-
terest, maintenance, and administration. This memorandum should request a
'revision of demurrage raties charged to the various users of the freight cars,
including other railways.
2.   Compensation
Should such request be denied, FEPASA should request from the
State and/or Federal authorities a financial compensation to cover the
incurred losses under the normalization program.
E.   Implementation of the Investment Program
1.   New Helvetia-Sorocaba Line, New Sao Paulo Marshalling Yards, and
Rehabilitation of the Mayrink-Evangelista de Souza Line
FEPASA will not carry out, or cause to be carried out, these
works until the feasibility and final engineering studies (Parts (b) and
(c) of the Transport Studies, Annex 7) have been completed, and the Bank
has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to review the studies and to
exchange views thereon with FEPASA.
2.   Rehabilitation of the Marilia-Panorama and
Araraquara-Santa Fe do Sul Lines
FEPASA will not undertake the rehabilitation of the western
sections of these lines (beyond Adamantina and Sao Jose do Rio Proto,
respectively) until the study of uneconomic lines and services (Transport
Master Plan, Annex 1) is completed and concludes that such rehabilitation
is economically justified.
3.   Rolling Stock
Orders for freight cars should be placed in accordance with the
conclusions of the studies of train and station operation and marketing
(Technical Assistance Program, Annex 7).
F.   Studies and Technical Assistance Program
FEPASA will implement these studies, described in Annex 7, accord-
ing to the time schedule outlined in Table 5.

THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT (FEPASA)
Studies and Technical Assistance Program
1.   Studies
(a) Feasibility and Final Engineering Studies: for rail transport
facilities identified by the Transport Master Plan (Annex 1).
(b) Boa Vista Workshop: Boa Vista is served by both the meter
gauge and the broad gauge parts of the FEPASA network and
is on an electrified section. This location is therefore
well suited for the construction of a central locomotive
workshop attending all the motive power of the system.
The study would focus on the facilities required (build-
ings, tracks, equipment) and on the manpower requirements,
taking into account the phasing out of other isolated exist-
ing workshops.
(c) Electrification Studies: Within the guidelines of a general
electrification study being done by GEIPOT at the federal
level, FEPASA's studies would focus on final engineering
studies of various sections earmarked for possible future
electrification.
2,   Scope of the Technical Assistance Program
In order to implement the ambitious Five-Year Investment Plan
and, especially, the 1976-1977 Project, FEPASA will obtain external assis-
tance in several fields:
(a)  Project Management and Control:  Direct assistance to the
higher management of FEPASA, in particular for the monitor-
ing of Project implementation, for possible revisions of
the Investment Plan, and for the preparation of periodic
progress reports (monthly to FEPASA's management, quarterly
to the Bank). Estimated manpower: two men for 24 months
each (48 man-months).
(b) Train and Station Operations: Review of the locomotive and
freight car requirement, rationalization of FEPASA's
transport plan, reduction of LCL services, revision of demur-
rage rates, improvement of turnaround time, expansion of
through train services, improvements in yard operations,
etc. Estimated manpower: five men for 24 months each



ANNEX 7
Page 2
(120 man-months).   The team would comprise one expert in
terminals, two experts in operations on the line, and two
experts in dispatching. The study is of prime importance
and is to start in 1975. Retroactive financing is proposed
for FEPASA's costs incurred in 1975.
(c) Permanent Way: Improvements in present practices for track
maintenance and renewals, work programming, etc. with special
emphasis on the introduction of mechanized track maintenance:
study of needs, implementation of new equipment and training
of operators. Estimated manpower: four men for 24 months
each (96 man-months). This study was started May 1, 1975,
with two German experts and two Brazilian counterparts.
(d) Marketing: Market and tariff studies, directed at attracting
potential rail traffic presently transported by road. Spe-
cial emphasis would be given to intermodal activities, con-
tainer transport, and training of promotional staff. Esti-
mated manpower: three men for 24 months each (72 man-months).
(e) Management Information and Data Processing: Continuation of
a good start in the rationalization of administrative tasks:
financial and cost accounting, personnel management, etc. to
be expanded so as to include mechanized inventories, rolling
stock and locomotive programming, etc. Estimated manpower:
157 man-months starting in 1975. Retroactive financing is
proposed to cover FEPASA's expenditures in 1975.
(f)  Training:  Improvement of FEPASA's training program, exchange
of training staff and trainees with other Latin American rail-
ways, drafting of specialized instructions related mainly to
permanent way and rolling stock maintenance practices but
also including station and yard duties. Estimated manpower:
six men for 24 months each (144 man-months).
(g) Personnel Management: Salary structure reforms to reverse
the present trend by which FEPASA is losing qualified staff
in centers of high labor competition (Sao Paulo, Campinas,
etc.), with special emphasis on workshop staff. Estimated
manpower: six men for 18 months each (108 man-months) started
in May 1975.

Traffic Forecasts
I. Freight Traffic
A. General
1.        Detailed traffic forecasts are based on the consultants' (MONTOR)
market study, prepared in early 1970, which analyzed the 1969 traffic flows
by commodity and origin/destination and made projections up to 1980. These
flows were subsequently updated by the new consultants (SOFRERAIL), FEPASA
and the Bank appraisal mission, using 1970-1974 data and taking into account
all relevant new developments. The principal underlying assumptions for
the forecasts of the main commodities analyzed are presented in Sections B
and C, while the following table summarizes the structure of the traffic
and its expected growth. Detailed projections by commodities are given
in Table 8 of the report.
1974             1979
(Forecast)

clinker)          (1,486)  (36.6)  (3,532)  (53.8)           +(18.8)
10 main agricul-
tural products,
of which            1,664    41.0    2,092    31.9            +  4.7
(Sugar, wheat,
corn and meals)  (1,386)  (34.2)  (1,822)  (27.8)            + (5.6)
Others                 535    13.2       326     4.9           -  9.2
Total          4,058   100        6,562   100             + 10.1
2.        The 62% increase in ton-km over the five-year period 1975-1979
(equivalent to 10.1% average annual increase) is accounted for mostly by



ANNEX 9
Page 2
industrial products (91%) and agricultural products (17%), while other
traffic haLs been assumed conservatively to decrease at an average annual
rate of 9.2%. The nine products shown in the table between parentheses
are expected to account for over 80% of the total traffic by 1979. The
expected high rate of growth of transport of these products, particularly
the industrial ones, should not be construed as indicative of the expected
growth rate of the corresponding sector. It results rather from a recuperation
by the railroad of a few typical railway goods now carried uneconomically by
truck on medium and long haul. Projections for these commodities are generally
based on specific sector duties which assume a moderate growth of the con-
sumption and production levels in line with the expected reduced expansion of
the Brazilian economy. As with the RFFSA system, the lack of adequate invest-
ments in the past, the poor quality of railway services and of adequate rolling
stock substantially dampened the demand for railway services in past years.
This resulted in a stagnation, and even a decrease, of the FEPASA traffic in
the period 1969-1972 as compared to road transport, which was increasing at
a fast rate (14%). With implementation of the Plan and a special marketing
effort, it is conceivable that the railroad can regain certain medium and
long distance traffic of other goods. This could lead to levels of traffic
higher than forecast since the projections for these other commodities assumed
a further diversion of this existing traffic from road to rail.
B.   Industrial Commodities
Petroleum Products
3.        The Sao Paulo area, where refineries are located, has a high
concentration of automobile traffic and industrial activity. As a
consequence, only a small portion of petroleum products is transported
by rail (less than 10%). Although the rail participation is small,
volumes are high and expected to increase markedly for the following
reasons: (i) the new REPLAN refinery is now in operation in Paulinia,
and special rail facilities are being completed to handle tank cars;
(ii) rail transport capacity of petroleum products is being increased
with the purchase of about 400 new tank cars for FEPASA; and (iii) the
CNP (Conselho Nacional do Petroleo), responsible for the distribution
and transport of fuels, gives priority to rail transport for supplying
the hinterland of Sao Paulo and the southern part of Goias and Matto
Grosso. So far, there are no plans for supplying refined fuels to these
areas by pipeline, and a "minimum" rail transport program has therefore
been set up in collaboration with FEPASA and PETROBRAS. This program
puts forth, as a lower limit, the doubling of rail transport from about
1.4 million tons in 1974 to 2.8 million tons in 1979. This seems likely
to be achieved considering that, with the provision of new facilities,
the 1975 traffic will already exceed 2 million tons.
Fertilizer
4.        Sao Paulo produces and consumes more fertilizer than any other
State, and the Santos Port alone imports 75% of total nutrients for fer-
tilizer production. The rail share of fertilizer transport (now estimated



ANNEX 9
Page 3
at about 50% of total consumption) is expected to increase to 60% by 1979.
Total rail transport would thus increase from 1.1 million tons in 1974 to
2.4 million tons in 1979. These forecasts assume the completion, in late
1978, of the rail access to the Santos left bank and the fertilizer terminal
of Conceicaozinha, as well as the construction of two new fertilizer plants
in Cajati (Amimbrasil) and Araxa (Arafertil). They are based on recent inter-
views with ANDA (Fertilizer Producers' Syndicate) and the main producers
regarding their production and distribution plans.
Cement
5.        Rail transport presently carries about 20% of the cement pro-
duced in the State. Production plans for 1979 call for nearly 9.5 mil-
lion tons, and rail transport is forecast at 1.7 million tons. This
includes 360,000 tons from the Cajati plant (first phase) in 1977, when
the rail access now under construction is completed, and 550,000 tons
from the Apiai plant, which is also being linked to the FEPASA system.
Limestone and Dolomite
6.        Limestone and dolomite forecasts are principally related to the
expansion plans of the COSIPA steel mill in Cubatao. In 1979, to meet its
production target, COSIPA will need to transport about 1.5 million tons from
the Sorocaba region to the Cubatao mill over the Sorocabana line and the new
Paratinga-Piacaguera link, now under construction.
Clinker
7.        The existing short-distance transport of 950,000 tons is ex-
pected to continue from the Votoramtim plant in Sorocaba to the crushing
plant in Sao Paulo. In addition, from 1977 onward, a new transport of
clinker of 400,000 tons is expected from the Cajati plant (second phase)
to the Sao Paulo area.
Wood
8.        Wood transport by rail decreased regularly from 1969 until 1972
but recovered slightly in 1973 and 1974. The increase in wood consumption
in Sao Paulo, coupled with a decreasing State production, should give the
rail carrier an advantage because of the longer transport haul of imported
wood. A moderate growth of 10% over the five-year period has, therefore,
been assumed in the traffic forecast.
Lime
9.        Lime transport increased in 1974 after being stagnant for sev-
eral years. Rail transport is only about 30% of the State production
because trucks normally have an advantage in the distribution of the



ANNEX 9
Page 4
product. Although production is expected to increase with the develop-
ment of the Cajati and Apiai complex, rail transport has been kept at
the 1974 level up to 1978, when the Votoramtim 200,000-ton capacity
plant is expected to come into operation in Lavrinhas.
Bauxite
10.       Projections are based on the estimated requirements of CBA, the
main consumer of bauxite in the State. Consumption is expected to go up
from 204,000 tons in 1974 to 384,QOO tons in 1979.
Steel Products
11.       Traffic is not expected to increase substantially until 1977,
when the Paratinga-Piacaguera link, connecting the COSIPA steel mill to
the FEPASA system , is completed. The 1979 target of 400,000 tons in-
cludes: (a) 60,000 tons of local traffic, corresponding to about 3%
of the regional consumption; (b) 50,000 tons of exports to neighboring
states, or 25% of their needs; (c) 180,000 tons of steel plates for the
General Motors Plant in Campinas; and (d) 130,000 tons between Piracicaba
(Siderurgica Dedini) and Sao Paulo.
Paper
12.       Moderate increases are forecast in 1976-1977 and 1979 based on
the expansion plans of the Klabin paper factory in Harmonia (Parana), which
produces about 90% of the paper used in Sao Paulo.
Iron Ore
13.       Iron ore traffic, to appear in 1977, corresponds to the estimated
requirements of Siderurgica Dedini in Piracicaba. The ore will come from
Minas Gerais and enter the FEPASA system in Sao Paulo. Although it is
likely that part of COSIPA's iron ore will be diverted from the Santos-
Jundiai RFFSA line to the future mixed-gauge Sao Paulo-Santos FEPASA line
in the lattet years of the Plan, this traffic was not considered here since
it was already included in the forecasts of RFFSA's 9th Division.
C.   Agricultural Commodities
Sugar
14.       In 1973-1974, the State of Sao Paulo produced about 3.3 million
tons of sugar, or 48% of Brazil's sugar production; it also exported about
1.3 million tons, or half of Brazil's exports. Seventy percent of the
exports comprised demerara sugar, transported by rail to Santos; the re-
maining 30% crystal sugar. Brazil, responding to the favorable outlook of
the world sugar market, is making efforts to increase production to 10 million
tons and exports to 5 million tons by 1980. Assuming Sao Paulo's current



ANNEX 9
Page 5
share of Brazil's production (50%) and the same transport allocation to road
and rail carriers, rail transport is forecast at 2.2 million tons in 1979,
including 200,000 tons of crystal sugar transported locally and 320,000
tons of crystal sugar to be exported. This, of course, will be contingent
upon implementing an investment program aimed at increasing sugar cane
production, refining, storage, and transport capacity.
Wheat
15.       Wheat consumption in 1974 in Sao Paulo was estimated at 1,3 mil-
lion tons and is expected to increase at an average annual rate of 4.5%.
Most of the wheat is imported through the port of Santos or transported
via the FEPASA system from the southern producing states. Brazil expects
to tend toward self-sufficiency; therefore, imports from the southern
States should increase. This, in turn, should favor the railroad since
wheat transport in Brazil is regulated by CTRIN, which requires rail
transport for interstate movements. The railway should transport 900,000
tons of wheat in 1979, which is equivalent to 50% of the expected consump-
tion compared with 600,000 tons in 1974 or 45% of consumption.
Corn
16.       Fluctuations in corn traffic have been important in recent years
due to large variations in export movements. Forecasts are conservatively
based on the expected 1975 level of 500,000 tons, increasing at an average
annual rate of 6% to reach 631,000 in 1979.
Soybeans
17.       Trends for the future soybean traffic are unclear and depend on
several factors, such as (a) the expansion of the oil extracting plants
in Presidente Prudente, Campinas and Sao Paulo; (b) the local production
increase; and (c) the movements of soybean surpluses generated in Minas
Gerais and Northern Parana. It has been assumed that rail traffic would
increase from the low 1974 level at a rate equivalent to the internal
consumption growth rate (6%).
Meals and Brans
18.       Traffic in meals and brans has been stagnant since 1969 in
spite of increasing production and suitability to rail transport. There
is, acdordingly, a possibility for FEPASA to increase its share above
the present low 24%. Estimated traffic for 1979 is close to 600,000 tons,
but could be considerably higher if a rail access were provided to the new
one million-ton capacity CUTRALE plant.



ANNEX 9
Page 6
Salt
19.       Salt is imported through Santos for State consumption, but only
a small part of the transport is by rail (about 10%) because of the small
distances involved. Traffic has been constant for the last three years
and is assumed to remain at the same level up to 1979.
Wheat Flour
20.       Like salt, wheat flour rail transport is limited by the small
distances involved between the mills and the consumption centers. In
spite of rising consumption, traffic has been assumed to remain steady
through 1977 with a small increase thereafter.
Coffee
21.       Because of the deregulation of coffee transport, which took
place in 1972, and also because of production difficulties, traffic
fell from about 500,000 tons in 1972 to 140,000 in 1974. This trend
is expected to continue, although at a slower pace, if some effort is
made to improve the quality of service and, particularly, the speed of
transport.
Cattle and Meat
22.       Cattle traffic has been decreasing steadily because of the
locating of slaughterhouses closer to cattle-raising areas and because
of truck competition; it is also a very uneconomic transport and should
be further discouraged. Projected traffic therefore is expected to de-
crease further to reach a residual value of 5,000 tons. On the other
hand, meat transport in the special, newly acquired isothermic cars should
increase slightly in line with consumption growth.
Others
23.       This category includes all remaining commodities.  Although the
category could increase if a recuperation by FEPASA of certain commodities
now transported by truck were successful, it has been assumed conserva-
tively that this category would further decrease at an average annual
rate of 7%.
II. Passenger Traffic
A.   Intercity
24.       Between 1969 and 1974, intercity passenger traffic declined 30%
from 2.7 to 1.9 million pass-km. For the FEPASA system, this is due to
the very strong competition of bus and air transport, which provides



ANNEX 9
Page 7
faster, more comfortable and more reliable service.  Except in limited
cases, intercity passenger traffic cannot at present be served adequately
and economically by rail because passenger numbers are small and the
geometry of the line and condition of the track do not permit the speeds
that would make rail transport competitive with other modes. Traffic is
expected to decrease further, albeit at a slower rate, for the following
reasons: (a) as the highway system expands and improves (with the exten-
sio of the Castelo-Branco Freeway, for instance), and with an increased
motorization rate, buses and cars will continue to make inroads into
intercity passenger rail traffic;' (b) passenger rail fares should be
considerably increased to cover variable costs (para.         ), and this
would reduce the traffic; and (c) investments to improve the quality of
service are not economically feasible and will be avoided, adding, there-
fore, to the disincentives of rail transport. In fact, an effort should
be made to "rationalize" these services in order to minimize losses, by
cutting down uneconomic services, forming more mixed trains, etc. It is
not believed that the higher fuel prices and the corresponding savings
of rail versus road transport would significantly affect the existing
disadvantages of passenger rail transport in Sao Paulo or in Brazil in
general. On a few links, however, such as Sao Paulo-Campinas, where the
transport demand appears very high, a study should be made to investigate
the economic and financial feasibility of improving rail passenger serv-
ices. Total intercity passenger traffic is expected to decrease annually
at about 5% up to 1979 (Table 9 of report).

THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT (FEPASA)
Items Subject to Further Review
(Maps IBRD 11571 and 11572)
1.   Helvetia-Sorocaba (New Line)
This realignment would replace the existing Itaici-Itu-Mayrink
meter gauge section, which has a very poor alignment limiting both speed
and tonnage. It would link Campinas and the other realignments now under
construction to the north (Helvetia-Guedes, Guedes-Mato Seco) with Sorocaba
and the improved network to the south and southwest. This section would,
therefore, serve two main objectives: (a) it would constitute a Sao Paulo
bypass for the north-south flows in the Sao Paulo-Santos corridor; and (b)
it would further improve the southern trunk line and the long distance
transport between the southern States of Parana and Rio Grande do Sul and
the center west State of Goias and the Federal District. The level of
traffic, which is now about 2 million tons and is expected to exceed 3
million tons by 1979, may justify this investment, estimated to cost Cr$
400 million, in the latter years of the Plan. As part of the Transport
Master Plan (Annex 1),a feasibility study will be made to compare the various
transport alternatives. A provision for this investment has been tentatively
included in the Plan for the years 1977 and 1978, but the actual use of these
funds should depend on the outcome of the study.
2.   Mayrink-Evangelista de Souza (Track Renewal)
This meter gauge link could constitute the lower half of the Sao
Paulo bypass mentioned above. It connects Mayrink to Evangelista de Souza,
the junction point on the Serra ahead of the steep section leading to the
Santos Port. This section, which presently carries almost no traffic,
could be used for export and import movements between the interior and
Santos. Its rehabilitation, therefore, was considered in 1972 as part
of the Export Corridor Program, specially funded by the Federal Government.
However, while improving this line, which has a very poor alignment, is
one possible solution to the Sao Paulo bypass, it is not the only one and
possibly not the most economic one. Track rehabilitation along this line
should therefore be postponed while the above feasibility study is completed
and the best alternative north-south bypass is defined.
3.   Sao Paulo Marshalling Yards
The FEPASA Investment Plan tentatively includes a Cr$ 425 million
provision for an intermodal terminal to be built on the rail ring near Sao
Bernardo between 1977 and 1979. This yard would be distinct from the large



ANNEX 10
Page 2
marshalling yard to be built by RFFSA near Rio Grande da Serra. Rio Pequeno
and other cargo terminals. However, the functions of these yards and their
integration in the overall freight transport plan of the State of Sao Paulo
are not yet defined. Construction should therefore await the results of
both the Transport Master Plan and the more specific Railway Studies (Annexes
1 and 7).
4.   Marilia-Panorama and Araraquara-Santa Fe do Sul (Track Renewal)
The western end sections of both lines (beyond Adamantina and
San Jose do Rio Preto, respectively) have a very low traffic density
(about 200.000 ton-km per route-km), and prospects are not clear. Re-
habilitation of these lines, which are probably uneconomic, should there-
fore be contingent upon the results of the study of uneconomic lines and
services (Transport Master Plan Study, Annex 1).
5.   Rolling Stock
The program of freight car acquisition, presented in Part A of
Annex 13, is still tentative. It will depend, among other factors, upon
the evolution of the various types of traffic and the reduction of the number
of FEPASA cars outside the FEPASA system. Orders for freight cars should
therefore be placed in accordance with the conclusions of the studies of
train and station operations and of marketing (Technical Assistance Program,
Annex 7).

THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT (FEPASA)
Suburban Services
A.   Background
1.        The Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area is expected to grow at annual rates
between 2.1 and 2.8% between 1975 and 1990. Diseconomies of scale are begin-
ning to induce both the migration of existing industries and the location
of new economic activity to points in the interior of the state such as
Campinas and Jundiai. Still, the current lack of adequate city services
will become more critical as the population in the Greater Sao Paulo area
changes, as indicated below:
1968            6.2 million
1975           10.5 million
1980           12.0 million
1990           14.5 million
2.        GEGRAN's Plano&Metropolitano de Desenvolvimiento Integrado (PMDI)
estimates somewhat higher figures, but, even with the Bank's conservative
estimates of city growth, the magnitude of the improvements of basic urban
services such as transportation, water supply, sanitation, housing, and
drainage that are required are substantial. The area has serious shortages
of urban infrastructure, as indicated by the table below, showing a sample
of services availability in 1975:
Services                       Demand met
Sewerage                             34%
Water Supply                         49%
Public Lighting                      65%
Drainage                              8%
Paved Access                         41%
Gas                                  10%
Garbage Collection                   64%
3.     . The magnitude of the problems and investments, and the collective
efforts required, call for institutional arrangements to ensure the most
efficient use of available resources. On a metropolitan basis, this is
being addressed by the creation of the State Secretariat of Urban Affairs
(Annex 2). Solutions to public transport problems, on the other hand, will
be implemented by ETUSP (Annex 3), which will ensure that:



ANNEX 1 1
Page 2
(a) The transport capacity provided by FEPASA will be used
intensively.
(b) Serious congestion in downtown areas will be eased initially,
and stabilized in the long run, by reorienting some bus lines
away from the center of the city where they constitute an
important part of the traffic mix.
(c) Buses will be used more efficiently by running across the
direction of the peak flow, thus increasing average speeds
(currently, as buses approach downtown, average speeds fall
under 10 km/hr at peak hours, buses having to stop for up
to 40% of their running time), and decreasing turnaround
per vehicle to load more passengers per peak hour; all this
without requiring construction of special infrastructure.
(d) The city will be able to develop beyond what otherwise
would be its transport crisis stage.
(e) Other investments in mass transport in the Sao Paulo
Metropolitan area will not duplicate FEPASA's investments
nor prevent FEPASA from obtaining an adequate economic
return on the investment.
(f) The Bank is supporting an investment of US$368 million
which, in turn, is part of a coherent and cost
effective set of metropolitan transport investments.
B.   FEPASA's Investments in Suburban Passenger Services
4.        FEPASA's Investment Plan includes Cr$ 2,943.6 million (US$368
million) at 1975 exchange rates. Including contingencies, investments in
suburban services will total US$470 million. The magnitude of the investment
is commensurate with the needs for mass transport in Sao Paulo. The invest-
ments will make possible the integration into one single system of all sub-
urban rail services in the city. The simultaneous upgrading of the level of
service of all suburban rail in Sao Paulo, 1/ together with the provision of
services through downtown, will increase urban rail passenger traffic. In-
tegrated operations, including tariffs and scheduling of RFFSA, FEPASA and
METRO with bus feeder services, will be implemented to ensure the intensive
use of the assets provided.
5.        The resulting integrated suburban rail network is shown on map
IBRD 11573. It serves the current high density area of Sao Paulo with (i)
the completion of the "anel ferroviario" provided for separately under this
project, (ii) corridors to the north, southeast and east (RFFSA), and (iii)
corridors to the northwest and southwest (FEPASA).
1/   RFFSA services are to be upgraded under the second railway loan to Brazil.



ANNEX 11
Page 3
6.        The integration of services requires the heaviest initial investments
from FEPASA, since FEPASA would need to (Table 5):
(a) increase its lines to the west from two to three and
its lines to the southwest from one to twos
(b) enlarge gauge, currently metric, to match RFFSA's
broad gauge;
(c) renew catenaries and increase substation power;
(d) enhance signalling;
(e) totally renew rolling stock; and
(f) replace existing stations and add new ones.
Sections D and E following evaluate FEPASA's investments assuming integration
of all suburban rail operations, coordination of all mass transport operations
and efficient use of capital resources both in the area of influence of the
project and the metropolitan area.
C.   Traffic Forecast
7.        Table 2 of the report shows the population, employment and income
distribution projections for areas of Greater Sao Paulo that are in the zone
of influence of FEPASA's investments. These figures show growth rates
somewhat higher than those of the metropolitan area at a whole, attributable
to favorable factors such as relative proximity to downtown, availability
of land, future land use and industrialization schemes being carried out in
addition to improved public transportation.

/1   Infrastructure included in the project (tracks, signalization, stations
and power supply) is completed, and part of the new rolling stock
begins operations.
D.   Economic Evaluation
8.        The economic evaluation quantifies the following benefits:
(a) economic cost savings between bus and rail alternatives;
(b) time savings due to improvement of commercial speeds over
alternative transport;
(c)  system benefits from the integration between FEPASA and
RFFSA suburban services (increase in average trip length
for the train mode);
(d) avoidance of further urban congestion which would increase
bus operating costs.
In addition, there are important benefits which have not been quantified:
(a) institution building toward complete metropolitan transport coordination
in Sao Paulo; (b) further development of the city made possible by the
provision of better urban transport infrastructure; (c) more intensive and
efficient use of the existing bus fleet in Sao Paulo; and (d) avoidance of
additional air pollution from buses and cars. Total investments required
exceed the US$368 million currently contemplated by FEPASA in that adequate
bus-rail transfers need to be provided at all new stations, additional
stations need to be built after the merging of FEPASA and Santos Jundiai
lines at Lapa, and additional rolling stock is necessary to attend a much
increased zone of influence. Estimates of these additional investments have
been made and used in the economic evaluation. However, because of the
uncertainty associated, a risk analysis of the economic evaluation has been
performed, details of which are shown below. Economic benefits have been
computed as economic cost differentials between bus vs rail unit costs for



ANNEX 11
Page 5
suburban services, comparing the situation with the Project against the
situation that would prevail without it. Only 15% deterioration of bus costs
has been introduced from 1980 on to take into account the effect of congestion
that would occur otherwise. This is a conservative estimate given the small
capacity of the Sao Paulo urban road network (Table 1 of this Annex) and
the incremental number of buses required to perform the same service, 1/
which are bound to have a more drastic effect on cost performance.
9.        The current cost of bus transport in Sao Paulo estimated by the
municipality of Sao Paulo is Cr$ .092 pass-km, which does not consider the
provision of infrastructure. Suburban rail transport, operating at 1980
forecast levels, has an economic cost of Cr$ 0.049 per pass-km, including
infrastructure. Average trip length, currently 19 km, is expected to grow
slightly to 24 km, reflecting the development of outlying areas. The lifetime
of the investments has been estimated at 25 years, and residual values of 40%
for stations, 25% for track and 15% for rolling stock have been used. The
value of time savings to passengers has been estimated at 25% of the wage rate
applicable. This corresponds to current accepted practice as described in
"A Survey of the Theories and Empirical Investigations of the Value of Travel
Time Savings", Bank Staff Working Paper No. 199. Average salary of users
of FEPASA's suburban services is Cr$ 2,100 per month. Commercial speeds of
FEPASA's services will be 45 km/hr versus 17.5 km/hr for buses today, and the
value of time savings per passenger has therefore been estimated at Cr$ 2.6
per work day.
10.       The economic evaluation is based also on the following assumptions:
-    Full year of operation covers 300 working days.
-    Initial purchase of rolling stock under the project (see
Table 5, Investment Program), is accelerated and completed
in 1978.
-    Additional investments in rolling stock take place in
1980, 1981, 1983 and 1985. (Investment costs shown in
the cost stream in Table 2 of this Annex.)
-    Additional investments in bus-rail transfer facilities and
stations on the Santos Jundiai line take place in 1979 and
1980 (Table 2 of this Annex).
The rate of return of all investments including additional rolling stock,
stations and bus-rail transfer facilities is 21.4%, and the first year benefit
is 15.3%. A 15% increase in costs would reduce the rate of return of the
project down to 18.6%.
1/   Average daily bus occupancy is 40% according to GEGRAN's studies PUB and
PAITT.



ANNEX 11
Page 6
E.   Risk Analysis
11.       Because of the cost uncertainties pointed out above and the number
of sources of benefits not quantified, as well as the possible fluctuations
in fuel prices and passenger traffic, a risk analysis was performed showing
an expected rate of return of 17.8% with a standard deviation of 4.2% and the
following cumulative probabilities:
Rate of Return /1   Probability of Exceeding Value of
Rate of Return
12.6                            90%
13.7                            80%
15.5                            65%
16.6                            50%
19.5                            25%
/1   Opportunity cost of capital in Brazil is estimated to be between
12% and 14%.
Table 3 of this annex gives a summary of the data used in the risk analysis
and a table of the frequency distribution and cumulative probabilities
observed.
F.   Conclusion
12.       On the basis of D and E above, the investments in suburban services
contemplated by FEPASA are justified, somewhat beyond what would have been
their optimal timing, and with a virtual certainty that will report benefits
exceeding the cost of opportunity of the capital involved. This statement
is further reinforced by the fact that not all benefits have been quantified.

ANNEX 12
Page 1
BRAZIL
THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT (FEPASA)
Economic Justification of the New Lines and Realigments
(Maps IBRD 11571 and 11572; Table 1)
A.   New Railway Infrastructure in the Campinas-Sao Paulo-Santos Corridor
(Map IBRD 11572)
1.        The Sao Paulo rail ring, the widening of the gauge between Jurubatuba
and Samarita, the Paratinga-Piacaguera link and the Sao Paulo yards are impor-
tant investments to increase rail transport capacity and safety and to limit
the growth of road transport in the highly congested Sao Paulo area. They are
included in the Five-Year National Railway Development Plan as priority items,
and federal funds have been earmarked for them (Financing Plan, Table 10).
As such, they were already discussed in Appraisal Report No. 570a-BR of
December 20, 1974, the Second Railway Project, Annex 11, page 9. However,
their Justification has been reassessed here because both the scope and the
costs of the undertaking have increased markedly since the last appraisal.
2.        As indicated below, the priority and need for these investments are
reconfirmed. They are expected to have a controlling effect on the growth, so
far unchecked, of truck traffic. However, since the benefits to be derived
from the above rail investments will accrue more or less rapidly depending
upon traffic buildup. it is important to ensure that an optimal allocation
of freight traffic between the rail and road carriers is reached at an early
stage, particularly in this very heavily travelled corridor. 1/
3.        To this effect, priority in the studies should be given to the
Transport Master Plan (Annex 1) and, based on this Master Plan Study, the
State Government has agreed, as a loan condition (para. 2.11), to prepare
and discuss with the Bank a time-phased program for (a) carrying out future
major transport investments such as construction or extension of existing
expressways, rail yards and any new rail works; and (b) implementing specific
policy measures necessary to ensure optimal intermodal allocation of freight
traffic between rail and road services.
(i) Sao Paulo Rail Ring and Yards
4.        This consists of a 34-km section linking Jurubatuba on the FEPASA
system with Ribeirao Pires on the Santos-Jundiai RFFSA line. It has been
1/   In 1973, traffic counts gave an average daily truck traffic of 6,000 to
8,000 vehicles along the corridor. Assuming an 8-ton truck load on
average, this represents a traffic density of about 20 million ton-km
per km compared with about 3.5 million by rail.



ANNEX 12
Page 2
divided for construction into four lots as follows: the first two lots, com-
prising the 23-km long Jurubatuba-Sao Bernardo section, are under the respon-
sibility of FEPASA and are included in FEPASA's Investment Program; the last
two lots, comprising the 11-km long Ribeirao Pires-Sao Bernardo section and a
large marshalling yard (Rio Pequeno), to be located on a separate branch line,
are under the responsibility of RFFSA and are included in RFFSA's Investment
Program. The yard included in FEPASA's program would be an intermodal terminal
located near Sao Bernardo.
5.        The objectives of the ring are:
(a) to provide a much needed alternative to trucking for many of the
automotive and manufacturing plants of the ABC zone, named after
the three industrial countries of Santo Andre, Sao Bernardo and Sao
Caetano;
(b) to eliminate freight traffic on the lines going to the center of the
city which will cater only to suburban passenger traffic;
(c) to complete the bypass for the long distance heavy traffic between
Belo Horizonte and Rio, on the one hand, and the Santos industrial
zones on the other. This is particularly needed because the
capacity of the Santos-Jundiai rack railroad will be exceeded by
1980, and possibly before, and, therefore, a direct access (not
through the city center) to the FEPASA line has to be provided.
6.        Benefits consist of savings in transportation costs for future im-
portant flows that would have to be carried by road should the project not
be implemented, and savings to passenger and freight traffic due to decreased
congestion, increased efficiency, and faster transport time. Quantifiable
benefits yielded a rate of return of over 36% at the time the study was
made. 1/ A complete updating of this feasibility study was not carried out
because, in spite of very large cost increases, the importance and priority
of the line construction is not in doubt. A quick check of the return on
this line, the related widening of the Jurubatuba-Samarita gauge and the yards
(see below) was made: with a new traffic rising from 5 million tons in 1979
to 14 million tons in 1986, transportation cost savings alone yield a rate
of return of 28%.
7.        The need for yards and terminals in the Sao Paulo area is obvious
but their construction should be based on, and await the results of, the vari-
ous related studies: Transport Master Plan, Rail Marketing, and Transport
Operation Plan (Annexes 1 and 7).
(ii) Widening of the Gauge between Jurubatuba and Samarita
(Sao Paulo-Santos Third Rail)
8.        This is to provide an alternative broad gauge access to Santos along
the existing one-meter gauge Sorocabana line of the FEPASA system. The new
1/   Feasibility Study, 1970, by Asplan-Parson, Brinckeroff and Douglas.



ANNEX 12
Page 3
rack railroad that was completed in 1974 to replace the old cable-car system
in the steep Serra section of the broad gauge Santos-Jundiai line is now in
operation, following a long period of test. However, the Brazilian Government
Luts noL consider the system reliable enough in view of the future importance
of this rail link which supplies, inter alia, the Cosipa steel plant with iron
ore originating in the central region. Also, because of train load limitation,
the capacity of the new line, estimated at about 10 million tons per year,
could be used up before 1980. The increased safety and the flexibility of
operation provided by a dual gauge system, therefore, justify carrying out
this work.
9.        Assuming a combined investment of about Cr$ 2 billion, including
the yards, and an additional rail traffic (over what the existing system
could carry) rising from 5 million tons in 1979 to 14 million tons in 1986,
the savings in transportation costs alone would yield a rate of return of
28%. If traffic buildup is one year slower than expected, the ROR becomes
23%; two years, 20%; and three years, 18%.
(iii) Paratinga-Piacaguera
10.       This is a 21-km rail link in the Santos area which connects the
Santos-Jundiai (RFFSA) line to the FEPASA line. It also provides a meter
gauge access to the Cosipa plant and to the left bank of the port of Santos.
Construction started several years ago and is partly financed out of the pro-
ceeds of the Santos Port loan (756-BR). Conclusion of the remaining seven km
in difficult terrain, with two viaducts and a bridge, is expected in 1977
at a remaining cost of Cr$ 155 million. With the limestone traffic only (1.5
million tons in 1979) the First Year Return (FYR) on the remaining investment
is about 10%, and completion of the works is recommended.
B.   Other New Lines and Realignments (Table 1 of This Annex)
(i) Guedes-Helvetia
11.       This 56 km-long line which serves the REPLAN refinery (Paulinia) and
bypasses Campinas is now open to traffic. Complementary services and stations
are budgeted for 1975 at a cost of Cr$ 37.6 million. Completion of this line,
which is expected to carry about 3 million tons in 1979 (mostly petroleum pro-
ducts), is well justified.
(ii)  Juguia-Cajati
12.       This 72-km extension of the existing line from Samarita to Juquia
will enable FEPASA to reach the industrial complex of the Serrana and
Quimbrasil plants in the Cajati mining area. Traffic volume is estimated at
1.3 million tons in 1979 and will consist mainly of cement and clinker. Work
was started in 1973, and completion of the line is expected to cost Cr$ 150
million or 40% of the total cost including the rehabilitation of the existing
Samarita-Juquia section. The FYR is estimated at 16%, thereby justifying
completion of the line.



ANNEX 12
Page 4
(iii) Sta. Gertrudes-Itirapina
13.       The broad gauge realignment between Sta. Gertrudes and Itirapina,
43.5-km long, will reduce the distance by 5 km only, but will provide
substantial operational benefits by improving the layout (28 curves with
1,145 m radius compared to 66 curves with minimum radius of 275 m), reducing
gradients (1% compared to 2%), higher speeds (no limit due to the layout).
Tonnage is to increase from 1 million tons in 1974 to 2.8 million tons in 1977.
Infrastructure works were started. in 1966, but were not completed due to lack
of funds. At year-end 1974, Cr$ 82 million had been spent, and Cr$ 62 million
are needed in 1975 and 1976 to complete the works. Without considering the
alternative cost of rehabilitating the existing line, estimated at Cr$ 40
million, the FYR is 10%, and early completion of the work is therefore justi-
fied and recommended.
(iv) Bauru-Garca
14.       The broad gauge realignment between Bauru and Garca reduces the dis-
tance by 28 km (70 km instead of 98 km) and markedly improves train conditions:
gradients are 1% instead of 2.2%, and there will be only 42 curves with a
1,145 m radius instead of 177 curves with a minimum radius of 200 m. Work
started in 1968 but was interrupted several times because of lack of funds.
An estimated Cr$ 270 million has already been spent and Cr$ 70 million are
still needed to complete the line. Because of the light traffic on this line
(300,000 tons in 1974, to increase to 500,000 by 1979) such an investment was
clearly uneconomic and should not have been started. As of now, with annual
savings estimated at Cr$ 2 to 3 million only, yielding an FYR of 3 to 4%, the
remaining investment is still marginal. However, because the old line is in
very poor condition, completing the realignment is still about Cr$ 40 million
cheaper than rehabilitating the old line. This rehabilitation is also more
economical than transporting all cargo by truck. Considering the alternative
truck transport costs, the FYR becomes 14%, thereby justifying an early
completion of the realignment.
(v) Guedes-Mato Seco
15.       The existing alignment has very poor characteristics: 162 low radius
curves (down to 125 m), gradients of 2.7% and tonnage limitations of 500 tons
per train. The new layout will reduce the distance by 9 km from 72 to 63 km
and will allow 1,200-ton trains to run at speeds up to 120 km/h. Work started
in 1966 but dragged along for lack of funds. By year-end 1974, an estimated
Cr$ 120 million had been spent, and completion of the works is expected to
cost Cr$ 162 million. This section is on the main line leading to Brasilia,
and traffic is expected to grow from about 1.9 million tons in 1974 to 3.4
million tons in 1977. If the realignment is not carried out, rehabilitation
of the existing line will have to be carried out at an estimated cost of
Cr$ 65 million. Taking this cost into account, the FYR is estimated at 10% in
1977, and completion of the work is recommended.



ANNEX 12
Page 5
(vi) Entroncamento-Amoroso Costa
16.       This 170-km long realigmnent north of the Guedes-Mato Seco section
on the southern trunk line which links the southern states to the center states
and to Brasilia will reduce the disLance along the existing linie by 30-km and
will allow for much better running conditions; 1,200-ton trains will be able
to run at speeds over 100 km/h as compared with 500-ton trains running at 50
km/h maximum on the existing poorly aligned section. Work started in 1970,
and Cr$ 800 million had been spent at year-end 1974. The cost to completion
is estimated at Cr$ 230 million.  Traffic was-abouE 800,000 tons in A74and
is expected to increase to 2,100,000 tons by 1977, the opening year of "the'
realignment, mostly because of the shipment of petroleum products from the
REPLAN refinery to Brasilia and the State of Goias. Savings estimated at
Cr$ 19 million in 1977 yield an FYR of about 30%, after allowing for the high
alternative cost of rehabilitating the existing line. Early completion of
this realignment is therefore recommended.

ANNEX 13
Page 1
BRAZIL
THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT (FEPASA)
Economic Justification of the Rehabilitation
and Modernization Program
1.        This is the main category of the Investment Plan.  It includes
acquisition of freight cars and locomotives, track rehabilitation, stations
and yards (except the Sao Paulo yard), workshops, electrification, signalling,
telecommunications and studies and technical assistance. Since some of the
new lines and realignments are under completion and, in some cases, will
generate new traffic included in traffic forecasts, the benefits of their
construction cannot be easily separated from those, say, of track or signalling
improvements on an adjacent section. Therefore, even though their completion
was justified on a case-by-case basis (Annex 12), their costs to completion
were added to the costs of this category in order to have overall matching
costs and benefits.
2.        The main items of this category were analyzed separately.  Part A
gives a justification of the rolling stock acquisition program and Part B,
of the motive power program. No separate analysis is given here of the
track rehabilitation program, which was found justified in most cases, except
on the two end sections specified in Annex 10, nor of the electrification,
signalling and telecommunications improvements which were also found justified
on the sections considered by the level of traffic. Finally, Part C gives
a combined evaluation of all items of the category in the form of a cost
benefit risk analysis.
A.  Freight Car Acquisition Program
3.        The freight car acquisition program for the Five-Year Plan is based
on the 1979 requirements and the fleet on hand in 1979 as computed in Tables
1 and 2 of this Annex. Stock requirements for 1979 by type of gauge and
wagon are derived according to traffic forecasts for various commodities and
take into account: (a) the seasonality of the traffic as measured by the
"traffic spread over"; (b) the imbalance of traffic movements as indicated
by the "percentage loaded wagon to total wagons" index; (c) improvements in
efficiency as measured by the "wagon turnaround time", and the "average
wagon load" index. The car fleet on hand in 1979 is based on the existing
inventory at year-end 1974, the scrapping program for the next five years,
including obsolescence in the case of "gaiolas" (cattle wagons) for instance,
and the private car fleet available. Net requirements for 1979 are then
adjusted to take into account the versatility of certain wagon types such as
the existing "Bombril" bulk car which can be used for transporting general
cargo. Finally, due to the existing important imbalance between the FEPASA



ANNEX 13
Page 2
wagon days outside the FEPASA system and the non-FEPASA wagon days inside
the FEPASA system, a provision was introduced to cover, in 1979, the part
of this deficit which would be strictly attributed to an imbalance in the
traffic distribution (see footnote 5 in Table 1). Because this and other
parameters are not yet well defined, this evaluation is tentative and should
be reviewed next year and every future year. In particular, orders for
1978 and beyond should be placed only after a more careful reassessment is
made of which specific wagons are needed and when (see recommendation in
paragraph 5.11).
B.   Motive Power Acquisition Program
4.        Table 3 shows, for each locomotive type (diesel meter and broad
gauge; electric meter and broad gauge), the number required in 1979 based
on traffic projections, Bank-estimated loco-km per annum, and the availability
ratio targeted in the Program of Action (Annex 5). The table also shows
the number of locomotives of each type that will be available by year end
1979, based on the 1974 year end inventory, and the FEPASA scrapping and
acquisition program. Comparing total numbers (required and available) shows
that they are close enough to validate FEPASA's overall acquisition program.
However, the discrepancy for the broad gauge diesel locomotives of 26 units
between the Bank-estimated requirements and FEPASA's program indicates the
need for reassessing the acquisition of this type of locomotive.
C.   Combined Evaluation of the Modernization Program and New
Infrastructure under Construction
(i) Methodology
5.        The analysis consists of comparing transport costs with and without
FEPASA's Investment Plan. The "without case" is the next best alternative
and most likely to be implemented should the Plan not be effected. It would
consist of carrying out a limited Investment Program, necessary and sufficient
to keep FEPASA's traffic level at about its last and highest level ever
attained (4 billion ton-km). Under this limited program, no capacity-
increasing investments, but only deferred renewals, would be undertaken.
Should this second best renewal program not be carried out, traffic would
fall below the 4 billion ton-km level and be taken up by the road carrier at
a cost substantially higher: it has been verified that alternatives involv-
ing partial or complete diversion of existing freight from rail to road
would be less economic than the two solutions considered here.
(ii) Assumptions
6.        Table 4 of this annex gives the various streams of the transport
costs in the "with" and "without" case. In the "with case", only rail costs
are involved since it is assumed that FEPASA, with the Plan, will be able
to carry traffic as projected. In the "without case", truck operating costs



ANNEX 13
Page 3
are computed, based on an economic cost of Cr$ .20 per ton-km (Table 5).
Deferred renewal would represent about 50% of FEPASA's Investment Plan,
the other half being capacity-increasing investments. Fixed costs were
assumed equal in both cases and constant in real terms for the period con-
sidered (30 years). Because of the uncertainty of certain cost items, a
risk analysis was made based on assigning specific probability distributions
to the various cost streams considered.
(iii) Results
7.        Based on the above analysis, the best estimate for the rate of
return is 16% and the frequency distribution is as follows:
ROR             10%       16%        20%        30%       50%

ANNEX 13 N'otes to
TABLES 1 and 2
PRAZIL
THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT <,'EPASA)
Estimate of freight car needL1979 - Footnotes to Tables 1 and 2
1/  The 1973 statistics show a discrepancy of between 10 to 15% between the "revenue"
or "commercial" ton-km and the "operating" or "trraffic" ton-km.  This is probably
due to terminal movements between yards and loading or unloading locations. It
was assumed that with improved transport plans this difference could be reduced
to 5% in 1979. Hence, the operating ton-km for 1979 necessary to derive the
wagon requirements are obtained by majoring by 5% the traffic estimated of net
ton-km.
2/  This is the average wagon turnaround time computed on the FEPASA system only
onthe basis of the average haul and the type of commodities,    it
includes    loading and unloading in the port of Santos but not the time spent
on the RFFSA system, nor in Bolivia.
3// As
:   As of April 1975.  These orders correspond to the 1476 meter eauge and 150
broad gauge cars included in the Investment Plan for 1975-
The new requirements computed at the end of the table will therefore cover
the 1976-79 period.
4/  The large excess of "other bulk" wagons is somewhat misleding-for mary of these
cars      ("Bombrils")                 can be used for both general cargo and
bu]2tra'sport.        Cement, other bulk and general cargo categories have
therefore been combined in a singIe category to ysbld an'updated net requirement.
5/  The following table gives: a) the mouthrly balance of FEPASA wagons outside FEPASA
minus non-FEPASA wagons on the FEPASA system; b) the average balance for 1974,
and c) the tentative target number for 1979.

Overall Economic Evaluation of the Investment Plan
1.        For the economic evaluation, the Five-Year Investment Program was
divided into four categories: (a)-suburban services; (b) new rail infra-
structure in the Campinas-Sao Paulo-Santos corridor; (c) other new lines
and realignments, and (d) the rehabilitation and modernization program.
Suburban services which have little overlap with the rest of the Investment
Plan were evaluated separately in Annex 11. The evaluation of new rail
infrastructure in the Sao Paulo corridor and of other new lines and realign-
ments is treated in Annex 12, where each item is justified separately.
Finally, the rehabilitation and modernization program is justified in Annex
13. New lines and realignments which will be completed within a year or
two have been added to this last category because their benefits will certainly
obtain before the end of the Plan (1979) and cannot be easily separated from
the other benefits of the modernization category. This is not so for the
two main construction items in the Sao Paulo region, i.e., the rail ring
and the doubling of the gauge between Jurubatuba and Samarita. These will
be fully completed only by the end of the Five-Year Program, and they will
induce both a new traffic and a new traffic distribution pattern in the
Campinas-Sao Paulo-Santos corridor. Since this new traffic has not been
included in the current traffic projections that are established up to 1979
and based on the existing rail network, no double counting of benefits will
occur.
2.        As a result, the overall evaluation is obtained by consolidating
the cost and benefits of the three following packages which have no or little
overlap:
(a) Suburban services;
(b) Sao Paulo rail ring, widening of the Jurubatuba-Samarita gauge;
(c) All remaining investments, including new lines and those under
completion.
Investments subject to further review were not included in this evaluation
because their benefits will accrue only beyond 1980 and cannot be easily
quantified at this stage.
3.        The results of the consolidation of the above cost and benefit
streams, with their respective probability distribution, can be summarized
as follows:

Tariffs and Costs
Ereiaht
1.        The present FEPASA tariff has four basic schedules for carload ship-
ments with about a 10% difference between each of them.  A fifth schedule is
ii for less than carload (LCL) traffic at rates about 10% higher than the
highest carload rates. Small lots (pequenas expedigoes) are carried at rates
a further 10% above LCL rates. The above are maximum rates and discounts of
10-15% are given on average. Contracts of three or four months duration at
special rates are made for certain traffics. Proposals for rate increases
are sent to the General Transport Accounting Bureau (Ministry of Transport),
which reviews them for consistency with RFFSA's proposals; the proposals are
then sent to the Interministerial Price Commission for approval.  Rates on
goods other than those for export carry a 10% surcharge (amounting to
Cr$ 32 million in 1974) which goes to the Ministry of Labor for social pur-
poses. Agreement was obtained during loan negotiations that the Federal
Gcvernment will neutralize the effect of the surcharge on FEPASA's competi-
tive position by January 1, 1977.
2.        Freight rates have been increased significantly in the last 18 months
and in early 1975 averaged Cr$ O.14 per ton-km (USA1.8).   This is fairly high
relative to trucking rates in the area and probably cannot be increased further
(except to offset inflation) until services are improved. Freight revenues
bi most cases cover long-run variable costs and make some contribution to fixed
costs. However, in the case of small consignments (pequenas expedigoesX long-
run variable costs are at least four times freight revenues. Agreement was
obtained during negotiations to phase this traffic out. Very low demurrage
charges for railway wagons increase the time of wagons off-line and slow
wagon turnaround. Such charges should be carefully reviewed to improve
wagon utilization and reduce costs.
Passenger Fares
3.        On interior passenger services,long-run variable costs are more than
double average passenger fares (about Cr$ 0.05 per passenger-km in early 175).
This ratewhich is equivalent to UShO.6  per passenger-km,is one of the
world's lowest. The very low fares and generally poor patronage cause the
large deficit on intercity passenger operations.
4.        For suburban passenger services,fares are slightly below long-run
variable costs. They are very low at Cr$ 0.70 per tr-ip or about Cr$ 0.37
(US/0.5) per passenger-km.

Assumptions Used in Making Financial Forecasts
Operating Revenues
1.        Tariff levels for 1974 were used to project all passenger and freight
revenues with an adjustment of 23% to allow for expected inflation between 1974
and 1975. During negotiations, the Government agreed to take what-
ever action is needed to neutralize the effects of the 10% surcharge on certain
services on FEPASA's competitive position by January 1, 1977. This will allow
FEPASA to increase charges for the relevant services by 10%, and it was assumed
that this would be done at the beginning of 1977. These tariffs were applied
to the traffic forecasts given in Chapter 5 of the report.
2.        Other revenues (non-railway, etc.) are based on 1974 income levels
adjusted for estimated inflation between 1974 and 1975.
Operating Expenses
3.        A costing analysis was carried out for FEPASA in June 1974, in
which 1973 costs were separated between fixed and variable costs and the
variable costs were further separated between suburban passenger, intercity
passenger and freight traffic. Variable costs were related to measurable
operating statistics (train-km, locomotive-km, gross ton-km, wagon-km, etc.).
Based on the traffic forecasts, operating statistics were forecast, allowing
for expected improvements in certain measures of operating performance
(average wagon load, wagon turnaround time, train size, locomotive and freight
wagon availability, locomotive-km per year, etc.). Based on these operating
statistics and the fixed costs and the variable costs calculated in the cost-
ing analysis, the 1979 costs were estimated. The 1973 costs were adjusted for
the following factors:
(a) an increase in unit personnel costs of 90% between 1973 and 1975;
(b) estimated inflation between 1973 and 1975 for the cost of materials;
(c) an increase in the numbers of FEPASA staff to about 28,000 in
1979 and a reduction in personnel employed by contract;
(d) an increase in average real salaries by 1979 of 15%;
(e) an increase in fuel costs to reflect current world prices
of crude oil;
(f) an increase in depreciation to reflect current replacement
values of depreciable assets.



ANNEX 16
Page 2
4.        Depreciation has been included in variable and fixed costs in the
analysis. Principal items of depreciation are locomotives, freight and
passenger cars and track. Depreciation is calculated on the basis of
utilization, i.e., locomotive-km, wagon-km, passenger car-km and gross
ton-km of trains, respectively. In addition, depreciation of other railwav
assets (buildings, stations, signalling equipment, etc.) is included in fixed
costs.
Subsidies
5.        At present FEPASA receives a subsidy each year, covering 60% of
the average expenditures (adjusted for inflation) made for maintenance of
track and security installations. It was assumed that this subsidy would
continue and would grow in line with such maintenance expenditures during
the forecast period. Beginning in 1977, it was assumed that a subsidy for
uneconomic services would be introduced. The amount of the subsidy was
based on the forecast difference between long-run variable costs and revenues
from intercity passenger services, the principal uneconomic service.
6.        It is unlikely that the subsidy will be as great as forecast.  As
a result of the studies of uneconomic services, such services should be
progressively eliminated, thereby reducing FEPASA's operating costs and
revenues and the related subsidies.
