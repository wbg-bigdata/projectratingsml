A. Program Purpose and Project Development Objective
1. Program purpose and program phasing:
The Government of Ghana (GOG) has articulated its long-term program of social and
economic development in its Vision 2020 document: alleviating poverty rapidly and becoming a
middle income country by 2020 through strong and broad-based economic growth. This will
require an annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 8% per annum which, in turn,
cannot be attained without rapid growth in the rural and agriculture sector. Indeed, the rural
population represents 63% of the country's total population and agriculture represents 38% of
GDP. Poverty in Ghana is predominantly rural. The incidence of poverty in rural areas is 52%
compared to 23% in the urban areas, with rural poverty contributing a very high share of 84% to
total poverty. Accordingly, the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) has prepared an
accelerated agricultural growth and development strategy (AAGDS) to increase the pace of the
sectors growth from the 3-4% rate achieved in the 1995-99 period.
The AAGDS is predicated on the premise that the high rate of growth envisaged will be based
on rapid technological change, private sector-led and export-oriented. The role of the public
sector will be to create the enabling environment for the private sector to boost agricultural
production and diversification, and substantially increase its value-added, by fostering
agro-processing and exports through investments in productivity increasing and/or cost reducing
technologies as well as improved marketing and management systems. The main elements of the
strategy are: (i) increasing access to improved agricultural technology; (ii) promoting the
production and marketing of selected agricultural commodities; (iii) improving rural
infrastructure; (iv) increasing access to rural finance; and (v) improving access to domestic,
regional and international markets. The function of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture
(MOFA) and other government agencies would be restricted to policy formulation, provision of a
supportive legal and regulatory framework, coordination of sector development, provision of
essential services with a high public good content and monitoring of sector development.
The proposed Agricultural Services Sub-sector Investment Program (AgSSIP) is one of the
major instruments for implementing this strategy, dealing mainly with the first two elements.
Improvement of rural infrastructure and of access to rural finance will be supported under
separate ongoing or pipeline investment programs supported by IDA and other donors (such as
the on-going Village Infrastructure, Feeder Roads and Gateway projects; the recently approved
Rural Financial Services Project and the ongoing policy dialogue to improve the performance of
the financial sector, and the national road sector development program currently under
preparation).
Achieving the long-term objective of GOG's accelerated agricultural growth and rural
development program entails institutional reforms and investment in social capital that require
long-termn support. A nine-year adaptable program lending (APL) has therefore been designed to
support the AgSSIP, to be implemented in three 3-year phases coinciding with GOG's three-year
rolling Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). AgSSIP will support all public
agricultural services programs managed by MOFA and the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research (CSIR). The first three-year phase of the APL will be focused on: (i) the introduction,
- 3 -



on a pilot basis before its full-scale implementation, of a demand-driven, polyvalent agricultural
service delivery system; and (ii) the implementation of policy and institutional reforms to re-focus
government services on their core functions and strengthen the technical, financial and managerial
capacities of the sector ministries and district governments for executing these core functions
effectively. The two subsequent phases of the AgSSIP would expand these reforms and programs
to a national level and support their consolidation.
2. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
The "Project" is the first phase of Government's program (AgSSIP) aimed at increasing the
growth of agricultural productivity and incomes as the driving force for reducing rural poverty,
improving food security and providing the basis for accelerated growth in the overall economy in
an environmentally sustainable manner. Within this overall long-term goal, the Project's specific
objectives are:
*  initiating and/or accelerating policy and institutional reforms for the strengthening of
Government's capacity to carry out its core functions;
*  promoting the decentralization of the planning and implementation of agricultural
development programs to the regions and districts by strengthening the capacities of:
(a) regional and district governments in planning and implementing agricultural
development programs; and (b) central ministries and agencies to focus on
policy-making, planning, monitoring, evaluation, technical back-stopping and regulatory
services;
3  promoting cost-effective demand-driven agricultural and extension systems that would
generate and disseminate technologies on a contracting and/or cost sharing basis; and
*  strengthening the capacity of farmers-based organizations (FBO) to play an enhanced
role in priority setting and decision making in agricultural and community development
programs and facilitate input distribution, credit, processing and output marketing
services.
3. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
The principal indicators selected for measuring progress toward the program's and the
project's development objective are detailed in Annex 1. They include: (i) sector impact indicators
: improved agricultural growth, increased rural household incomes, increased value of agricultural
production and marketing, reduction in unit cost of production, reduced rate of land degradation,
reduced over-exploitation of fisheries resources, and increased number of beneficiaries
disaggregated by gender; (ii) institutional development indicators: decentralization of services,
capacity building at all levels, cost-effectiveness of service provision, services cost recovery level,
empowerment of FBOs and satisfaction of clientele of agricultural services; and (iii)
project-specific input/output indicators: satisfactory operation of the competitive agricultural
research grant scheme, and the agricultural extension and the FBO development funds; adoption
rates and impact of research and extension recommendations; private sector participation in
financing research and extension activities; productivity increases by commodities; increased
planting material and improved breeding livestock produced; increase in female intake into
agricultural colleges and extension personnel; reduction of post harvest losses; rate of
-4 -



privatization of animal health services; dissemination of accurate agricultural statistics and market
information; etc.; and (iv) specific triggers to move from one phase to another, presented in
Section B.4 below. A joint Government and donor evaluation team will determine the extent to
which the above objectives and trigger conditions for moving to Phases II and Im are fulfilled.
B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex I)
Document number: IDA/R2000-26 [IFC/R200-321          Date of latest CAS discussion:
03/30/2000
The overriding aim of GOG's social and economic development program is the reduction of
poverty and general improvement in the welfare of Ghanaians. The strategy for poverty reduction
lays emphasis on fast economic growth, in particular in the rural sector, to generate increased
employment opportunities, and improved access by the rural and urban poor to basic public
services such as education, health care, water and sanitation and family planning services. The
principal elements of the strategy to achieve these objectives include: (i) accelerating economic
growth through the balanced implementation of sound fiscal, monetary, and other macroeconomic
policies; (ii) strengthening growth in the agricultural sector through opening access to markets
and promoting the use of more modem farming methods and marketing practices; (iii) broadening
and deepening the manufacturing and services sectors in order to create new business and
employment opportunities; (iv) investing in human resources development by improving access
for all to nutrition, education, health, water and sanitation services; (v) encouraging the
development of an indigenous entrepreneurial class through improving access to training, financial
services, credit and local and foreign markets; and (vi) reducing the isolation of the poor
communities through strengthening economic infrastructure such as roads and communications
networks. GOG's AAGDS is at the center of its poverty reduction strategy and the proposed
AgSSIP is one of the major instruments for AAGDS' implementation. It is also specifically
identified in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) as the main instrument of Bank support to
the agricultural sector.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Rural Poverty Alleviation and Agricultural DeveloDment. In Ghana, about 60% of the
total population and employment is rural, and poverty is highly concentrated in rural areas and
among small farmers, particularly in the savanna zones: the incidence of poverty is 36% among
the rural population and rural poverty accounts for 84%  of total poverty in Ghana. Social
indicators are also very low for the rural population:

3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
A poverty reduction strategy must therefore give the highest priority to rural development.
The more so that rural poverty reduction has also a strong impact on urban poverty. Indeed,
there is strong evidence from detailed studies (India, Indonesia, China) that rural growth not only
reduces rural poverty, but also has a strong impact on reducing urban poverty more than does
urban growth. In Ghana, a very large part of current employment and of future employment
opportunities is in the very large labor intensive small-scale agricultural and non-agricultural
sectors of the rural economy. Because of strong linkages, it is agricultural growth, based on
technologically-driven factor productivity increases that could provide the effective engine for
employment creation in the farm and non-farm sector. Increased farm production increases
agricultural employment and incomes; but it also lowers food prices which has a strong effect not
only on rural but also urban poverty and the competitiveness of the economy as a whole; and
increased farm incomes stimulate the demand for goods and services in the large, labor intensive
rural and market town small-scale non-farm enterprise sector.
A2riculture Opportunities and Constraints. Agriculture is central to Ghana's economy,
providing employment to the majority (60%/o) of the working population, particularly women. The
sector contributed 39 percent of total GDP and 46 percent of export earnings in 1997. Since
1983, Ghanaian agriculture has recovered from almost total collapse. Successive macroeconomic
reforms have improved the incentive framework through exchange rate reform, liberalization of
trade, reduction of the heavy tax on cocoa producers and substantial public sector withdrawal
from agricultural production, input distribution and commodity processing and marketing. GOG
initiated a number of investment programs from the mid-1980s onward to rehabilitate basic
agricultural services, culminating in the formulation of a medium-term agricultural development
strategy in 1990, which aimed at achieving sectoral growth of 4 percent p.a.. The agriculture
sector responded well, reversing the negative and sluggish growth rates of the late 1980s and
early 1980s into a credible 34% annual growth in the late 1990s. Ghana has a high potential for
expanding production of agricultural commodities, both tradable and non-tradable. Its climate,
fast growing domestic and regional markets and proximity.to the European market offers good
opportunities for sustained growth. The development of the sector nevertheless faces constraints
that the government has identified and started to address.
Low Factor Productivity. Ghana's agriculture is dominated by resource-poor smallholders
who employ low level of technology. Simple hand tools such as the hoe and the cutlass are the
major farm implements. At an average application of less than 9 kg/ha, Ghana is among the
-6-



lowest users of chemical fertilizers in Sub-Saharan Africa. Only about a third of all farms keep
ruminants, and animal draft power is confined to the northem regions, which are free from tsetse
fly. Except for commercial poultry and pig producers, livestock producers rarely use currently
available technology to control diseases or feed and house their animals. There is very little
agro-processing beyond the home-consumption and cottage-industry levels. Irrigated farming is
not widely practiced. So far, increases in agricultural production have been derived mainly from
area expansion. All these factors translate into low factor productivity, resulting in low incomes
and widespread poverty among the rural folks as well as overexploitation of the land resource
base. Concerted effort is required to intensify agricultural production by introducing appropriate
technology for improving labor productivity, particularly for women who produce about 60
percent of food crops and all the cottage industry based food processing.
Technology Generation and Transfer System. From the early 1990's, a reasonably efficient
agricultural research system has been established, forging multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional
collaboration by researchers in the national agricultural research institutes, the universities, and
MOFA. The national agricultural research strategic plan was prepared in 1994, using criteria
reflecting the agricultural development priorities of Ghana. The Agriculture, Fisheries and
Forestry Sector Directorate (AFFSD) was established to review the relevance of research
proposals, their funding, quality assurance and accountability in the use of research funds. Five
research/extension/farmer linkage committees (RELCs) were established for each of the major
agro-ecological zones of the country. Farners and agri-business representatives are engaged in
the RELCS and have started influencing the research and extension agenda. These institutional
reforms needs to be pursued though, with an increased focus on making research more
demand-driven, cost-effective and accountable for results.
In the early 1990s, the Government also introduced a major reform of its agricultural
extension system. Stronger linkages with research and farmers were established, fostering active
interaction, allowing field diagnosis of farmers problems to influence research activities and
facilitating on-farm trials for the research system, thus making research and extension programs
more relevant to the needs of farmers. In 1998, an independent beneficiary assessment of
extension services confirmed that a functional agricultural extension service has been established
nation-wide. However, despite the achievements of the last decade, there is still room for
significant improvement in particular to shift the system from an almost total dependence on
government services/resources to one of shared responsibility and financing with fanners
associations and the private sector. In addition, women specific issues are still not being
addressed adequately, in spite of attempts by the extension services to be gender-sensitive. Finally,
extension services need to be restructured to fit with Government's decentralization strategy.
Under GOG's decentralization program, implementation of agricultural extension activities is now
the responsibility of the 110 district assemblies (DAs) in the country, with the regions providing
technical and administrative support. Although MOFA has decided to cede its district staff and
budget to the DAs, integration of the district agricultural directorates into the district assemblies is
yet to fully materialize, pending the adoption of the Local Government Service Bill that has been
awaiting adoption since 1997.
Weak Farmer-Based Organizations. Farmer-based organizations (FBOs) in Ghana include
-7 -



formal cooperatives, pre-cooperative societies being organized and prepared for registration, rural
associations (some formal and others informal) and farmer groups. FBOs are engaged in a variety
of activities. Some are formal cooperatives or farmers' associations dealing with the provision of
inputs, credit or marketing outputs, or a combination of two or all of these activities. Others are
processors and marketers of commodities, such as palm oil and sheanut butter, or formed to
represent outgrowers in their relations with the nucleus plantation or processing plant. Others
again are formed to manage resources such as water supply for irrigation or livestock. Although
farner-based organizations can play a prominent role in accelerating rural development, they are
relatively weak in Ghana. They have lost their vigor and vibrancy since the early 1960s,
particularly after excessive political intervention and government control and the confiscation of
their assets. The most binding constraint in the development of effective FBOs is the low level of
education of the membership and leadership, which contributes to lack of understanding of basic
principles of cooperation, organization and management, thus weakening the foundation on which
rural institutions can be built. GOG realizes the importance of supporting FBOs as pillars of social
and economic development in the rural communities and encouraging NGOs and its development
partners to complement its efforts.
Land Tenure. Land administration and utilization in Ghana has been guided both by
customary practices and by enacted legislation. Since traditional institutions (stools and skins)
own most of the land, customary practices have played a dominant role in providing access to
land, giving rise to different types of land tenure governing the holding, acquisition, use and
disposal of land which vary from region to region and among etniic communities. While these
varied customs have served a vital role traditionally, they have also tended to hamper sustainable
agricultural development. The lack of formal documented land demarcation and titles contribute
to protracted litigation which prevent and discourage the acquisition of large areas of contiguous
land for commercial agriculture. The government is preparing with Bank assistance a proposed
land administration project for consolidating land legislation and implementing a systematic land
titling and registration program.
Over-exploitation of Natural Resources. The forestry and fisheries subsectors have long
suffered from ineffective resource management. A poor policy framework, an over-stretched
public service, overlapping institutional responsibilities, vast excess capacity and inefficiency in the
saw-milling industry, and massive fanner encroachment have combined to cause annual tree cuts
at double the sustainable rate, resulting in a dramatic reduction in the extent and quality of
Ghana's forest resources. The Natural Resources Management Project, financed by IDA and other
donors, is helping to provide the policy framework and resources required to resolve these issues.
Similarly, the weak fisheries service and the lack of enforcement of the fisheries laws have led to
significant depletion of both marine and lake fisheries. An on-going Fisheries Subsector Capacity
Building Project is addressing some of these issues by using community-based fisheries resources
management techniques and through rigorous enforcement of the fisheries laws and substantial
increase in fishing license fees. However, it is clear that the country's natural resource base needs
to be far more prudently managed than has been the case to date, not only in forest, wildlife and
fisheries resources, but also in water and crop and pasture lands. This requires, inter alia, changes
in the institutional and policy frameworks that will bestow decision making and accountability on
the communities who own, utilize and manage natural resources.

Sector Issues to be adressed by the Project and Strategic Choices. AgS SIP will focus on
supporting the institutional reforms necessary to establish a demand-driven and cost-effective
technology generation and dissemination system necessary to foster sustained technological
change and productivity gains in agriculture. The reforms will aim at (Q) continuing the
restructuring of MOFA to focus its activities on core public service functions and decentralize its
activities; (ii) empowering beneficiaries and their associations to articulate their demands and
control the quality of services received; and (iii) promoting the emergence of an open, competitive
service provision system calling for partial cost recovery from beneficiaries according to their
willingness and capacity to pay.
The strategic choices considered in the design of the agricultural services delivery system
involved: (i) commercial versus small scale farning; and CiH) public versus private. The choice, in
both cases, was not "either-or", but rather a balance relating largely to the extent of the public
versus private goods nature of the activities to be financed.
(1) Large-scale Commercial vs. Small-Scale Agriculture: setting priorities for both research
and extension involves difficult decisions on geographic targeting, commodity focus
(traditional exports, non-traditional exports, basic food crops) and target beneficiaries (small
farmers, large scale commercial farmers and agribusiness). The Program will promote an
agricultural research and extension system that responds to the needs of a wide range of
beneficiaries, from subsistence to commercial farmers, focusing public financing mostly
non-tradable food crops and the needs of small-holders while fostering private delivery and
cost recovery for services to commercial farners and high-value commodities.
(i) Public vs. private sector service provision: again, the AgS SIP will support a system based
on a dual approach: a demand-driven, cost recovery funded, private delivery based system for
high value commodities produced by farmers producing for the market; and a more
supply-driven, publicly funded system for services targeting small subsistence farmers and
messages with a high public good content.
(iii) Agricultural vs. Rural: AgSSIP will support not only the development of agricultural
services but also research and extension for non-agricultural technologies that have an impact
on the productivity of farm labor and efficiency of household resource uses as well as with
agro-industrial transformation that have wider development impact in the rural sector.
4. Program description and performance triggers for subsequent loans:
AgSSIP would be implemented in three 3-year phases supported by an Adaptable Program
Lending (APL) coinciding with GOG's Medium Terrn Expenditure Framework. Govemmenes
long-term vision of the sector's institutional set-up and the main content of the program, its
phasing, and the performance triggers to move from one phase to the next are presented in the
attachments to Annex 1.
Phase I of AgSSIP (2001-2003) would:
-9-



1. complete the restructuring of MOFA around its core public service functions,
decentralize its decision-making process and strengthen its capacities to carry out
efficiently these core responsibilities;
2. strengthen the priority setting and evaluation mechanism for research activities, support
priority/strategic research programs and promote an increased participation of
beneficiaries in program selection and funding through a competitive research grant
system;
3. complete the transfer of front-line extension service responsibility and of the
corresponding resources to the District Assemblies;
4. promote private sector participation in the delivery and funding of extension services;
S. strengthen Farmers-Based Organizations' capacities to participate in the design of
agricultural policy and the delivery of goods and services to farmers; and
6. strengthen the agricultural training education system to build its capacity to meet the
human resources/skills needs of the sector.
Phase n of the program (2004-2006) will expand and consolidate the reforms carried out during
the first phase to restructure MOFA, strengthen the capacities of District Assemblies to manage
extension services, establish demand-driven agricultural research and extension systems and
promote FBOs.
Phase m (2007-2009) will consolidate the progress achieved in establishing a demand-driven
pluralistic agricultural technology generation and diffusion system, based on partnership between
the public and private sector and service cost recovery from beneficiaries.
Second Phase Triggers. Initiation of the second phase will be based on the results of an external
review to be carried out after 30 months from the date of effectiveness to the progress made
toward achieving Phase 1 objectives and meeting the following specific Phase 2 major triggers:

and
*  Agricultural colleges and farm institutes curricula revised to cater for skill needs of the
private sector.
The detailed triggers and means of verification for Phase II and Phase m are given as attachments
to Annex 1.
C. Program and Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost
breakdown):
AgSSIP comprises four inter-related thematic sub-programs supporting and reinforcing the
development of improved and demand driven agricultural services for rapid agricultural growth
and poverty reduction. These sub-programs are: (i) strengthening the agricultural technology
generation and diff-usion systems; (ii) restructuring and strengthening of the Ministry of Food and
Agriculture and devolving the responsibility for the planning and implementing of agriculturl
extension/development programs to the district assemblies; (iii) development of farmer-based
organizations; and (iv) strengthening agricultural education and training. The figures below are
those for Phase 1.

I. Reforming and Strengthening Agricultural Technology Generation and Diffusion (USS 7&o milion)
AgSSIP will strengthen the national agricultural research and extension systems to support
Government's objective of an accelerated agricultural growth of 5-6% p.a. Users of research and
extension services will participate in priority setting, funding and delivery of these services to
ensure that they are relevant, in accord with national development priorities and cost-effective and
financially sustainable in the long-run. The program will build on the experience of the national
agricultural research and extension projects completed in 1999. Farnner-based organizations
(FBOs) and agribusiness will be adequately represented in the National Agricultural Research
Policy Committee, on the boards of research institutions and the five zonal RELCs. Funds will be
provided for the research grant scheme and for contracting out extension services in selected pilot
districts to eligible FBOs and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). The lessons drawn from
the experience of Phase I will be used to scale-up these reforms during Phase II.
Specific activities of the agricultural research component will include: (i) improving research
governance and management and financial accountability; (ii) introducing sustainable and
competitive research financing, including competitive research grant scheme and voluntary
contributions from research users; (iii) funding priority research programs, and (iv)
strengthening/rationalizing the scientific information systems, human resources and research
infrastructure. Specific activities of the agricultural extension component will include: (i)
supporting the decentralization of front-line extension activities to district Assemblies; (ii)
empowering beneficiaries to participate in priority setting and decision making of extension and
adaptive research programs; (iii) strengthening linkages with research; (iv) establishing and
operating an Extension Services Development Fund to promote pluralism in the delivery of
agricultural extension services; (v) mainstrearning gender, equity and environmental conservation
issues in extension services; and (vi) supporting the national initiative on prevention and control of
IV/AIDS.
II. Institutional Reform and Strengthening of MOFA (US$29.5 million)
AgSSIP will support reform and strengthening of MOFA within the framework of the
decentralization policy of GOG that aims to transfer agricultural extension/development
responsibility to the District Assemblies. Although MOFA has already started to put this
decentralized structure in place (MOFA is included in the Public Services Reform Program), the
formal institutional framework is not yet in place and MOFA needs assistance to complete its
restructuring and align its capacity and internal processes with its new mandate. AgSSIP will
assist Government to complete its decentralization program in the agricultural sector by
supporting MOFA restructuring and providing the necessary support at the regional and district
levels. MOFA's structure, staff skill mix and internal processes will be assessed and realigned
- 12-



with its new mandate (this will be conducted over a period of 14 months). The central directorates
of MOFA will be strengthened and their staffing/skills developed to enable them to perform their
core functions (,policy formnulation, planning and coordination, monitoring and evaluation of
implementation of development policies and programs as well as provision of information and
regulatory services) and to provide backstopping services and training to the regional
development officers and subject matter specialists (SMSs) and to the front-line extension agents
at district level.
HII. Development of Farmer-Based Organizations (US$9.9 million)
AgSSEP will provide support for the development of FBOs to allow them to play a major role
in shaping agricultural policy and in providing services to farmers. Specific activities of this
subprogram will be: (i) development of policies and legal framework conducive for the
development of FBOs and the operation of NGOs; (ii) promotion and development of grass-root
level FBOs; (iii) strengthening the capacity of agencies and entities responsible for assisting the
promotion and development of FBOs; (iv) upgrading the Cooperative College and transforming it
into a College of Farmer-Based Organizations; and (v) establishment of an FBO Development
Fund. In contrast to the current situation where the Department of Cooperatives (DCO) is
responsible for promoting the development of cooperatives, this role will be transferred to the
FBOs movement itself through their apex organizations such as the GCC. Similarly, the audit
function of the DCO will be transferred to the GCC and the private sector, leaving only
registration of cooperatives and regulatory functions to the department. To spearhead this
development, an FBO Development Fund of US$5 million will be established and managed by the
FBO movement itself. A Board of Trustees will provide policy guidance and decisions on
awarding matching grants to FBOs. A detailed implementation manual for the management of the
fund has been prepared, stipulating the terms of reference and composition of the Board,
eligibility criteria for awarding matching grants and procedures for application by FBOs, screening
applications and awarding the matching grants. An NGO with experience in the development of
FBOs will be competitively selected to provide the technical secretariat to the Board and
undertake promotion of the Fund's objectives and operating policies, and manage its activities.
IV. Strengthening Agricultural Education and Training (US$5.7 million)
The objective of this sub-program is to strengthen the capacity of agricultural training colleges
and farm institutes to produce the human resources/skills critically needed for the sustained
development of the sector. The major constraints that these colleges and farm institutes
(University of Ghana, Cape Coast University, Kwame Nkumah University of Science and
Technology, MOFA's farm institutes, Departnent of Cooperatives' Cooperative College) face are
inadequate infrastructure, equipment, shortage of funds for operating costs and limited
opportunity to upgrade skills of teaching staff. Many of the buildings require renovation.
Moreover, the agricultural colleges were established to train manpower for employment in the
public sector, mainly MOFA and the agricultural research institutes. Private sector demand will
increase as the envisaged privatization of agricultural services gains momentum and individuals,
FBOs and NGOs organize to deliver these services. This will require overhauling the curricula of
the agricultural colleges to reorient them in meeting the skilled manpower demands of the private
sector. This will be achieved through: (i) an in-depth review of Ghana's agricultural education
strategy and the revision of the curricula of the colleges and the institutes to cater for the skill
- 13-



needs of the private sector; (ii) the inclusion of the private sector, FBOs and NGOs on the boards
of the colleges to make them responsive to the demands of the private sector and to obtain its
support; (iii) the recruitment of new teaching staff and upgrading skills of existing teaching staff
to meet the training demands of the private sector; and (iv) rehabilitation of the infrastructure,
transport and equipment of the colleges and institutes. Finally, the Human Resources
Development Directorate (HRDD), responsible for the oversight of the agricultural colleges and
farn institutes, as well as for planning and implementing training programs for the career
development of all MOFA staff, will be strengthened through the provision of training, transport,
office equipment and operating costs.
2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The key policy and institutional reforms to be addressed by AgSSIP are discussed in Section
B.3 above. They relate to: (i) completing the restructuring/strengthening of the Ministiy of Food
and Agriculture to focus its activities on the cost-effective provision of core public services; (ii)
supporting the decentralization of agricultural services through capacity-building of District
Assemblies in this area; (iii) introducing demand-driven, multiple source delivery
research/extension services; (iv) promoting the increased responsibility of beneficiaries in the
management and funding --through cost-sharing arrangements-- of agricultural services; (v)
supporting the development of farmer-based organizations; and (vi) supporting the strengthening
of the countly's agricultural education and training system. These policy reforms and programs
have already been adopted by Government and initiated. The existing policy and institutional
framework; although not fully developed, is satisfactory to implement the activities proposed
under Phase 1 of the AgSSIP. This framework will be completed during Phase 1 and the effective
implementation of its main elements will be triggers for Phase 2.
3. Benefits and target population:
AgSSIP will benefit the general rural population, particularly women farmers, traders and
food processors. Poverty is pervasive among the rural population. As indicated in B.2 above, the
incidence of poverty is 36% among the rural population and rural poverty accounts for 84% of
total poverty in Ghana. The AgSSIP will therefore be essentially targeted to the poor. Social and
economic benefits will accrue to rural people through increased productivity and income resulting
from enhanced access to agricultural technology and markets for selected commodities. Increased
agricultural production and income resulting from the proposed programs will create additional
employment opportunities for rural and town folks engaged in input supply, transport, trading,
processing and financial activities. Food security, at the national and household level, will be
promoted: storage losses (currendy at 20-30%) will be reduced substantially and aquaculture will
be promoted to increase the inland supply of fish. The program will also specifically address
sustainability issues in the management of the natural resource base. Disease control of plants and
animals will be intensified using integrated pest and disease management. Surveillance, control
and management of marine and inland fisheries will be intensified so that the depleting fisheries
resources can be rehabilitated.
AgSSIP will also promote governance, effectiveness and accountability by supporting
decentralization of agricultural services through strengthening the role and capacities of District
Assemblies and FBOs in planning and implementing agricultural development and environmental
-14-



conservation programs. Arrangements will be made to provide fora for beneficiaries, the private
sector and civil society to influence project implementation and monitoring so that the project is
responsive to the perceived needs of the stakeholders in the agriculture sector.
4. Institutioal and implementation arrangements:
MOFA will be the lead government agency for the implementation of AgSSIP, working
closely with the Ministries of (i) Environment, Science and Technology (MEST), (ii) Lands and
Forestry (MLF), (iii) Local Government and Rural Development (MLGRD); (iv) Finance (MOF);
(v) Education (MOE); and (vi) Employment and Social Welfare (MESW). MOFA will also
collaborate with other government agencies, the private sector and civil society in implementing
the project. A National Program Advisory Committee with strong representation of the private
sector and civil society will be created to provide guidance for AgSSIP and monitor its
implementation (Annex 2).
The Director of the Policy, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Department (PPMED) of
MOFA will be the National Coordinator for AgSSIP and the secretary to the National Program
Advisory Committee. The National Coordinator will be assisted by a Deputy Director who will be
explicitly responsible for the administrative management of AgSSIP. The Program Coordination
Division (PCD) of PPMED would be strengthened with additional staff, training of staff and
provision of computers to render efficient procurement, disbursement and accounting services to
the program. The detailed implementation and financial management arrangements are described
in Annex 2 and summarized below:
1. The MOFA Reform Componentwill be implemented by PPMED and the technical
directorates of the ministries concerned under the coordination and supervision of the
office of the Chief Director, MOFA;
2. The Decentralization program. In line with the decentralization policy of GOG, most
of the services envisaged under the AgSSIP will be implemented at the grass roots level
by staff of the District Assemblies, whose capacity will be strengthened by training ad
technical assistance under the project, with technical backstopping and training support
from MOFA and the Ministry of Local Government;
3. The Agricultural Research Component will be implemented by CSIR of MEST, which
coordinates agricultural research in collaboration with the four national universities,
MOFA and regional and intemational cooperators;
4. The Extension componentwill be implemented with collaboration among MOFA, the
district assemblies, FBOs, NGOs and the private sector. MOFA will be responsible for
overall national agricultural extension policy formulation in consultation with all
stakeholders and monitoring its implementation and impacts. District assemblies will be
responsible for planning and implementation of district agricultural extension services in
consultation with stakeholders and in collaboration with FBOs, NGOs and the private
sector as service providers on a contractual basis;
- 15-



5. The FBO Promotion Component will be implemented by the Department of
Cooperatives, the Ghana Cooperative Council and the Board of Trustees for the FBO
Development Fund in collaboration with NGOs.  A tripartite memorandum  of
agreement would be signed between the Ministries of Finance, Employment and Social
Welfare and the Ghana Cooperative Council governing the assistance to be given to
FBOs and the management of the Fund (Annex 2);
6. The Agricultural Educafion and Training Component will be implemented by the
Human Resources Development Department of MOFA, in collaboration with the
Ministry of Education and the agricultural faculties of the four universities in Ghana,
especially in the review of Ghana's agricultural education policy and the curricula of the
colleges and farm institutes.
Procurement and Financial Management will be the responsibility of PCD of PPMED for all
the non-research components of AgSSIP and the CSIR for the research component. Both PCD
and CSIR have procurement and finance proficient staff.  The CSIR has a satisfactory
computerized accounting and control system. A consultant is modifying the MOFA computerized
accounting and control system to ensure it will meet the requirements of consolidated accounting,
reporting and control systems under AgSSIP. The PCD will receive periodic reports from CSIR
to enable consolidation and presentation of the needed reports to the oversight committee and all
donors. The audit of AgSSIP accounts will be conducted annually and carried out by independent
and qualified auditors under competitive bidding and acceptable to IDA.
PCD and the CSIR will be responsible for procurement under International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) and packages for vehicles, computer systems and major contracts for equipment,
works and consultant service. In accordance with the overall procurement plans, PCD and CSIR
will delegate to the implementation units procurement of items locally available in the districts,
minor constructions, small contracts for miscellaneous items of supplies, services and training and
all items under operating costs. PCD and CSIR will have oversight responsibility for ensuring the
implementing units plan procurement and process contracts in a timely and orderly manner,
following correct procurement procedures. The DCO will be responsible only for monitoring and
guiding the implementation of the subprojects under the FBO Development Fund, ensuring
participation of FBO Committee members in specific procurement steps, i.e. preparation and
appraisal of subprojects, processing and award of contracts, supervision and certification of
completed contracts. Use of NGOs for procurement processing and service delivery will be
encouraged at all levels.
The Loan Administration Change Initiative (LACI) has been formally launched in Ghana and
it is expected that all projects will comply fully with this new requirement at the start of
implementation or put in place an action plan to ensure compliance within 12 to 18 months of
project implementation. LACI requires projects to prepare quarterly projects management reports
(PMRs) in the areas of finance, procurements including contract details and project progress.
AgSSIP would comply with LACI requirements within this period.
Monitoring and Evaluation. PPMED will operate and maintain an effective Monitoring and
- 16-



Evaluation (M&E) system for MOFA programs that will ensure the capture, analysis and flow of
information needed for tracking down performance and evaluating impact of policy and
development interventions, as a decision-making tool for program managers and policy makers.
It will consist of performance monitoring, beneficiary assessment, and impact evaluation, which
would be c.onducted as described in Annex 2. Performance monitoring will track progress of
activities against planned targets including financial, physical inputs and outputs, timeliness and
efficiency of delivery of services. Such information will be gathered and analyzed by AgSSIP
implementation agencies themselves, using the key indicators included in the program appraisal
document and the implementation manual in formats agreed upon with PPMED. This will be
done at district and regional levels and would be used by district and regional policy makers,
planners and program implementers to amend the implementation of their policies and
development programs to achieve their goals and targets.  PPMED would compile the
information to produce a national picture which would be used similarly by national policy
makers, planners and program implementers. The monitoring performance reports would be
produced semiannually. However, simple tables of targets and achievements and remarks for
explaining the deviations would be produced on a quarterly basis. These reports will be circulated
among the AgSSIP oversight committees and donors.
Beneficiary Assessment and Impact Evaluations will be carried-out from time to time, in
collaboration with civil society and the private sector, to gauge the satisfaction of beneficiaries on
services they receive and the efficiency of delivery of services including extension services,
progress of privatization of extension services and support to FBOs, and to assess their impacts.
Results of such assessments and evaluations will be used to determine the extent to which the
program and sector development objectives have been achieved. Given inadequate capacity of
PPMED in terms of staffing and analytical skills, PPMED will establish a twinning arrangement
with local Universities and other partner institutes, such as Institute of Statistical and Social
Economic Research (ISSER) and Center for Economic Policy Analysis (CEPA), under a
memorandum of understanding. Again these reports would be circulated among the AgSSIP
oversight committees and donors.
Donor Coordination. The donors active in the agriculture sector, including, the European
Union (EU), Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), Department for International
Development (DfflD), Gesellschaft fuer Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) and JICA have
participated in the preparation of AgSSIP and in its pre-appraisal and appraisal. CIDA has
committed Canadian $15.0 million in untied funds to support AgSSIP. It is preparing a Canadian
$25 million food security project for the eastem half of the Northern Region. Many of the
components envisaged deal with technology generation and diffusion, development of FBOs and
capacity building at the district level and would be implemented under the framework of AgSSIP.
The EU is financing the Cocoa Swollen Shoot Virus Disease control program. It has committed
Euro 7.5 million in 2000, with additional funding in subsequent years. The EU is also interested
in supporting the monitoring and impact evaluation component of AgSSIP. The African
Development Bank (AfDB) is interested in supporting the livestock development component with
US$15 million during 2001-2005, in addition to financing the just-starting Food Crops
Development Project that would be implemented under the framework of AgSSIP. The
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is financing ongoing agricultural
-17-



projects in the Upper East and Upper West regions which also fall under the framework of
AgSSIP. DfID has already provided GB Pounds 1.0 million to kick-start the implementation of
AgSSIP by supporting a number of studies and activities that would pave the way for smooth
launching of the project. DfID is considering further support to AgSSIP in its upcoming bilateral
aid discussions with GOG.
As part of the implementation of the Comprehensive Development Framework initiated in
Ghana in 1999, donors active in the sector have been meeting more frequently to discuss GOG's
strategy and policies in the agriculture sector and the preparation of AgSSIP. These meetings are
chaired by the Deputy Minister of MOFA, while the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) is
the leading agency assisting MOFA in donor coordination. This forum would be used to
follow-up on the implementation of the AAGDS and AgSSIP. While all the support to AgSSIP
would be given in the form of parallel financing, donors have agreed that, to the extent possible,
there would be a common procurement, accounting and reporting system that should satisfy all
donors. Donors would field joint implementation support and program evaluation missions. With
the experience gained in Phase I of AgSSIP, consultations would be held among donors to
explore the possibility of joint financing to support GOG's agricultural expenditure in Phases 11
and mI through the budget rather than through discrete projects.
D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Project vs. Subsector Program: Until now, GOG has been undertaking reform and investment
programs in the agricultural services subsector on the basis of individual projects, many of which
are spatially, temporally and/or donor restricted. This was rejected in favor of a program
approach because the project approach has resulted in: (i) poor coordination and low impact; (ii)
inflexibility in allocation of donor and government counterpart resources across the sector; (iii)
absence of prioritization in public expenditure emanating from weak public expenditure
management, particularly in counterpart funds; (iv) wastage, duplication and fragmentation of
government's management of aid and strain on financial and human resources, due to proliferation
of project implementation arrangements and management units; (v) dependence on technical
assistance and differing or inconsistent donor implementation, accounting and reporting
procedures; and (vi) lack of participation of stakeholders in project preparation and
implementation programs driven by donor agenda rather than national priorities, resulting in poor
national commitment.
AgSSIP avoids these pitfalls because it is sector-wide and national in scope, supporting a
large share of Government's public expenditure program in the sector. It has been prepared
within the coherent policy framework provided by the AAGDS and Govenmment's decentralization
strategy and institutional policy framework. It will be financed by key donors active in the sector,
with the procedures for procurement, accounting, auditing and reporting gradually standardized
as much as possible. In addition, AgSSlP has a built-in flexibility as it adopts a programmatic
format and its content is reviewed annually and in the context of Government's three-year rolling
plans. These features should ensure greater project efficiency, as well as more ownership,
- 18 -



capacity building, and sustainability than past discrete projects in Ghana.
Adaptable Program Lending (APL) vs. Specific Investment Loan (SIL): The selection of an
APL was an additional strategic choice made for three reasons. First, institutional development,
agricultural technology generation, and technology adoption are long term processes that would
benefit from stable, long term support. This is especially so in Ghana, where major system reform
and redirection is necessary. Secondly, development of a pluralistic research and extension
system does not lend itself to blueprint financing. Institutions require time to develop strategies,
plans, and alliances and project financing must adapt to institutional needs as they evolve. And,
finally, decentralized provision of demand-driven services represents a fundamental change in
Ghanaian agricultural technology programs and requires a period of learning and refining program
design and implementation strategies as these programs are developed.
Institutional Reforms and Support to Essential Services vs. Support for productive
Investments. Another project altemative considered was to include productive investment in
support of irrigation, fisheries and commercial agriculture. This was rejected on two grounds.
First, it would complicate the project and make it unwieldy to implement effectively.
Furthermore, productive investments require institutional credit that GOG would have liked to see
channeled via the Agricultural Development Bank (ADB). However, there is a need to deepen
financial sector policy and institutional reforms in Ghana and there are currently two ongoing
studies to define a sector strategy to do so. The findings and recommendations of these studies
would inform the institutional and policy reforms required to deepen financial sector reforms and
promote sustainable institutional credit into commercial agriculture.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Decentralization, Beneficiary and Private Participation: Past agricultural projects heavily
depended on public intervention, resulting in top-down planning and implementation,
less-than-satisfactory relevance and cost effectiveness and poor ownership of the programs by the
beneficiaries. To ensure the program's relevance and beneficiaries' ownership, the AgSSlP will be
managed in a decentralized fashion, most of the planning, implementation and decisions being
made at the district level. Farmers and rural communities will be empowered to take decisions
and participate more fully in their economic and social development, and in the management of
natural resources, irrigation schemes, water supplies, markets, storage facilities, etc. To improve
cost effectiveness, private contractors will be encouraged to participate actively in the provision
of services in extension, input supply, animal disease control and treatment, marketing and
processing.
Cost Recovery: Research, extension and livestock services have so far been totally dependent
on public funding. AgSSIP is designed to promote cost recovery from beneficiaries through
voluntary contribution by the industry and farmers' associations, and the full privatization of
certain services such as animal health care. Contract and competitive research grants will be used
increasingly to promote relevance of services and cost-effectiveness in their delivery, as well as
developing beneficiaries willingness to pay.
Local Formal Traning: External training of manpower at the Ph. D. and M.Sc. levels
Manpower training has been very expensive, limiting the number of trainees that could benefit
from the available training resources. Such training will be restricted to the local universities,
except in very few disciplines in which graduate programs are not available locally. Fellowships
under the program at the local universities would provide opportunities to strengthen their
capacity.
Lessons from Sector Investment Programs: Several agricultural sector investment programs
(SIPs) have been launched in Sub-Saharan Africa in the last 5-6 years. Although it is too soon to
draw definite conclusions from their experience, a few useful lessons are emerging that are
noteworthy. First, governments' commitment, not only the sector ministry but also all
collaborating ministries and agencies as well as the Ministry of Finance and/or Development
Planning, to pursue a sector program approach is crucial to the ownership of the program and its
success. Second, an acceptable macroecoomic stability, a coherent sector policy and articulate
sector strategy has to be in place before initiation of a sector development program. Third, a
medium-term sector expenditure review, which translates the priorities and strategies of the sector
into an implementable development program has to be prepared. Fourth, sequencing of activities
is critical for the success of a SIP, depending on the institutional capacity, policy environment,
readiness of sector strategies for implementation. Finally, effective donor coordination by the
government is key to the success of a SIP. Regular consultation and discussion are essential for
building consensus on broad and crosscutting and strategic sector issues and to provide a
framework on the basis of which donors would determine the kind and level of assistance to the
program.
- 21 -



GOG has experience in SIP since it is already using the SIP approach for the development of
the health, education and the natural resources sectors with reasonable success. As a result, the
preconditions outlined above for the success of a SIP are largely fulfilled for the AgSSIP. GOG is
committed to pursuing macroeconomic stability and had made significant progress in recent years.
A coherent accelerated agricultural growth and development strategy was articulated and
adopted. An agriculture sector expenditure review was conducted and the sector's expenditure
prepared within the MTEF. An institutional assessment of MOFA and the CSIR was conducted
on the basis of which the institutional reform and human resources development activities under
AgSSIP were designed. The capacities in the national agricultural research, extension, livestock
and fisheries were built and operating systems put in place through previous and on-going Bank
and other donor supported operations. MOFA has already deconcentrated its operations to the
district level and is ready to effect fiscal decentralization as soon as the local government service
bill is enacted and district assemblies are able to absorb the directorate of agriculture into their
fold.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
GOG has formulated a national strategy for accelerated agricultural growth and rural
development in support of the Government's Vision 2020, and prepared an AAGDS in support of
Vision 2020. The AgSSIP has been prepared by the GOG and its local stakeholders as the major
instrument of implementing this strategy. In preparing AgSSIP, MOFA had set up a Task Force
(TF), composed of 30 members to guide and coordinate the preparation of proposals for the
program. The TF comprised prominent people, representing the stakeholders from the private
sector (14), NGOs (2), academicians (2), local government (2), parliamentarians (2) and central
government (8). The TF had five sub-committees each responsible for guiding and coordinating
the preparation of the proposals for implementing each of the five major elements of the AAGDS.
The chairperson of the TF and the chairpersons of the five sub-committees were all from the
private sector.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The Bank has a long-standing involvement in the agriculture sector, assisting the Borrower in
formulating and implementing policy and institutional reforms and in preparing its rural
development strategies (1990, 1996, and 1997). It has established a strong relationship with the
key government agencies, MOFA, MEST, MLF and MLGRD and other donors active in the
sector. It is in a position to draw on past Ghanaian and international experiences and lessons to
improve and fine-tune an appropriate agricultural sector investment program suited to the country
context and capacity for implementation. The proposed investment program is linked to ongoing
fiscal and macro-economic reforms as well as support to decentralized service provision and
promoting private sector and civil society involvement in rural development. The Bank has,
therefore, a comparative advantage in encouraging policy and institutional reforms and promoting
appropriate and sustainable agricultural investment programs and in leveraging additional
resources from other donors.

E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
O Cost benefit    NPV=US$ million; ERR = % (see Annex 4)
O Cost effectiveness
* Other (specify)
AgSSIP is one of the major instruments for implementing Ghana's AAGDS, which supports
Ghana's Vision 2020. It was specifically identified in the CAS as the main instrument of future
Bank support to the agricultural sector. AgSSIP supports core public sector functions, and is
therefore a justified public investment program. The requisite basic macroeconomics and sectoral
policies are in place for the launch of the AgSSlP.  After some slippage in 1996, the
macroeconomic situation started to tum around in 1997. However, Ghana's fiscal performance
deteriorated in 1999 as a result of external shocks caused by a shortfall in donor assistance, sharp
declines in world prices for Ghana's two principal exports, cocoa and gold, and a significant
increase in oil prices. GOG has endeavored to pursue restrictive fiscal and monetary policies in
order to maintain macroeconomic stability. The domestic primary surplus is expected to remain
level at 3.4 percent of GDP, the overall fiscal deficit (on a commitment basis) will be 6.7 percent
of GDP, and the inflation rate target will be at, or below, 8 percent. The govemment has reduced
the top tariff rate from 25 percent to 20 percent. These developments, along with Ghana's
liberalized foreign exchange regime, will help restore the country's good macro-economic stance.
At the sectoral level, domestic agricultural input and output marketing have been liberalized, and
the Govemment is committed to pursuing liberalization of the cocoa sector.
Economic analysis
Benefits and beneficiaries. AgSSIP would contribute to Ghana's economic growth in
several ways. It would benefit agricultural producers by raising their incomes through technical
efficiency and technological change in crops, livestock, fisheries and forestry production and in
agro-processing. It would foster a favorable business environment for the private sector and
strengthen the capacities of farm-based organizations to access services and advance their own
development. It would contribute to improved governance through the decentralization of public
agricultural services, and encourage better environmental management by promoting sustainable
agricultural production techniques. Overall, AgSSIP would contribute to poverty reduction by
raising rural incomes, improving food security, and empowering grass root organizations.
The core beneficiaries are agricultural producers who are expected to adopt better production
technologies: farmers, livestock producers and fishermen. Quantifying the number of beneficiaries
is difficult because of the demand-driven nature of the program and because it entails double
counting: the same beneficiaries could gain from several activities of the program. AgSSIP
implementing agencies, however, would establish baseline data early into implementation for
monitoring the number and profile of the beneficiaries reached and for evaluating the impact of
the program on their production and income.
Break-even analysis. The expected benefits are quite substantial, but most cannot be
quantified because they accrue to the entire sector and, indeed, the whole economy. Thus,
standard economic rates of return are not feasible for the AgSSIP. For such sector-wide
- 23 -



programs, current Bank standard practice favors a quantitative break-even analysis of the
incremental cost and benefits streams at the national level. The break-even analysis determines the
minimum incremental growth in total AGDP required to justify the proposed cost stream of the
program. Results of this analysis indicate very modest minimum growth rates (from 0.14 to .15
percent p.a.) to justify the program. It should be noted that the AGDP cannot capture benefits of
AgSSIP outside national accounts (e.g. poverty reduction, food security and environmental
preservation), and that value added in agro-processing and agricultural exports are not even
counted in AGDP.
Historical performance of growth of Ghana's agriculture sector shows that the break even
growth required to justify the AgSSIP investment can easily be surpassed. During the past decade,
average real incremental AGDP growth stood well above this minimum. Real AGDP averaged
2.7 percent in 1990-97 and accelerated to over 4 percent at the end of the century, from 1996 to
1999. AGDP dipped in 1997 (4.3 percent) but forged ahead to 5.3 percent in 1998 despite
drought conditions. It is quite feasible that the agricultural sector will grow at least by 0.14 to
0.15 percent p.a. to justify the cost of the AgSSIP. This proposition is supported by MOFA
estimates that show ample room for improvement in agricultural productivity. Achievable yields
in the major food crops are three times higher than actual yields. This is despite the fact that
technical efficiency accounted for 90 percent for the growth of 3 percent in total factor
productivity in Ghana.

Profitability of Research and Extension. World wide experience shows that large
economic returns accrue to investment in research and extension. Profitability of research and
extension investment is widely documented in Mali (maize), Zambia (maize), Kenya (maize),
Uganda (maize, groundnuts, sesame, maize, beans, cassava, cooking bananas), Senegal (cotton).
In Ghana, estimates using the economic surplus approach, a best practice in estimating the
economic returns to investments in research and extension, indicate high ERR for cowpeas (52
percent), maize (69 percent) and pineapple (78 percent). The profitability of improved farm
technology is also supported by positive farm budgets.

determined to pursue to maintain a stable macroeconomic framework. Ghana's historical support
to agriculture provides a useful background to this analysis. The analysis includes reviewing
incremental cash flow of government finance, mechanisms of cost recovery, and availability of
counterpart funds.
Public expenditures in agriculture. Expenditures in the agriculture sector increased in real
terms during 1995-1997, but indicators of the level of agricultural expenditures declined from the
1995-97 to 1998-1999 periods (Table 2). Compared to the recent past, however, current public
support to agriculture has shifted away from cocoa to the non-cocoa sub-sector. Expenditures in
the sector remain dominated by recurrent costs and, within this category, by wages and salaries.
Also, actual expenditures are often at great variance with approved allocations. The programmatic
approach of AgSSLP within the MTEF would provide adequate resources to the sector and help
minimize the variance between allocated and actual expenditures in the future.

* Provisional estimate
AgSSILP within the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. The MTEF aligns GOG and
donors funds with what is affordable over the medium term (three years) and the annual budget;
allocates spending based on policy priorities; and aims at producing intended results at least costs.
The 2000-2002 MTEF would be readily adjusted to account for the AgS SIP as soon as GOG and
donors negotiate its terms and conditions.
While financing of the AgSSIP calls for a substantial increase in donors' contribution (150%)
over current levels of the agricultural sector MTEF, it requires only a modest increase (18%) in
- 25-



GOG's contribution. Furthermore, GOG's net-of-tax contribution will amount to about 2 percent
of the current MTEF for the implementing agencies. This modest increase is designed to ensure
that affordable GOG financing will be available and committed during implementation of the first
phase of AgSSIP.
Fiscal hnpact:
Incremental cash flow of government finances. Analysis of GOG's cash-outflow related to
the first phase of the program also shows that the fiscal burden of the first phase of the AgSSIP is
quite bearable over the life of the credit. Only a minimum growth rate of 0.03 percent of the
AGDP would be required to generate revenue to break even with the stream of GOG's cash
outflow over the life of the credit. By themselves, cocoa taxes, which represented some 4 percent
of AGDP in 1998 could cover this outflow. However, AgSSIP counts on other revenues from
taxes (for example, import taxes and VAT on AgSSIP induced activities) and cost recovery
mechanisms to be generated outside cocoa taxes to help cover government cash outflow.
The Govermment will support a very modest level of the recurrent costs during implementation of
the first phase: 22 percent of the total recurrent costs (and 18% net-of-tax) at the end of first
phase. The second and third phases of AgSSIP will provide additional resources to support
government expenditures after the first phase. More importantly, however, Govemment
expenditures will gradually decrease over the years because of increased cost recovery from
beneficiaries. At the same time, strong commitment within the MTEF will be needed from
govemment to continue supporting the program after implementation. This serves to demonstrate
the critical importance of fimrly establishing, during implementation, the cost-sharing and other
revenue-generating mechanisms that will relieve, and sometimes even eliminate, govemment's
financial burden.
Mechanisms for cost recovery. AgSSIP is set to introduce innovative approaches in
commercialization, privatization, co-production and cost-sharing of agricultural services to
enhance the financial sustainability of these services. These cost sharing and other
revenue-generating mechanisms are already being developed at many agencies of MOFA. In the
first year of the program's implementation, AgSSIP implementing agencies would develop
baseline cost estimates of services to be privatized, out-contracted, co-produced, and cost-shared
for monitoring and evaluation of the cost recovery mechanisms.
Conclusion. The economic analysis conducted during appraisal supports the economic
rationale of the program and suggests that the program will reach its objective of spurring growth,
increasing incomes of agricultural producers, processors and distributors and contributing to
poverty reduction, particularly in the rural areas where it is predominant. The fiscal analysis shows
that the program, which fits the coherent framework of the MTEF will be affordable by GOG.
However, to enhance the financial viability of the project, particularly in light of residual recurrent
costs to be supported by Government, privatization and cost-recovery mechanisms must be firmly
instituted during implementation. Many of AgSSIP implementing agencies have already started
the process which will be deepened during its implementation.

3. Technical:
There is an important stock of suitable technologies ready for 'dissemination to small-holders.
These techologies have been proven to work under similar socio-economic conditions as in exist
in Ghana through on-farnm adaptive trials. A strong beneficiary participation is built into the
research and extension service deliveries that would ensure the continued relevance of these
services to the clientele. The program design takes into consideration existing institutional
capacities and lessons learnt under previous operations (National Agricultural Research, National
Agricultural Extension, Livestock Services, Agricultural Diversification, Cocoa Rehabilitation and
several natural resources management projects). AgSSIP supports a number of institutional and
policy reforms and capacity building initiatives that increases the efficiency and cost-effectiveness
of the agricultural service delivery system, which are acceptable to and supported by the
Borrower and beneficiaries. The proposed reforms have been carefully sequenced to be in step
with capacity-building efforts and, for many of them, scaling-up will be based on the lessons from
the pilot phase.
4. Institutional:
4.1 Executing agencies:
The main executing agencies, MOFA and CSIR staff are experienced in implementing ]DA
and other donor assisted projects and have performed creditably in the past: MOFA has
implemented seven IDA financed projects in the last decade and CSIR managed the National
Agricultural Research Project during 1991-1999. However, the institutional review of MOFA has
highlighted several short-comings in the capacity of some of the concemed directorates in
carrying out their duties effectively. The main problem is insufficient number of professional staff,
which will be rectified through new recruitment and contracting out part of the work to third
parties as in the case of the PPMED and Research, Statistics and Information Directorate (RSID).
Both the GCC and the DCO who will be implementing most of the FBO development program do
not have any experience in managing IDA financed projects. Their capacity for improved
planning, budgeting and program monitoring, as well as related to IDA operational procedures,
will be strengthened through in-service training. MOFA Financial Controller would ensure that
their accounting and reporting system is functional, transparent and efficient. All of the project
components have strong in-service training and capacity building programs that will be
implemented immediately following project launch. There are a number of capable local and
international NGOs that are implementing agricultural development programs at the grassroots
level. These would be recruited to provide services, particularly in the promotion of FBOs.
MOFA has engaged a consultant to improve its computerized financial management system in
line with the new decentralized arrangement of making funds available directly to the districts.
The system would be designed to accurately record and report information on all the resources
and expenditures under the program, including both GOG and all donor financing, and in
conformity with the World Bank's requirements for accounting, auditing and project management
reporting. The system will also be capable of identifying the source of funding for different
activities or tracing what activities were financed by specific donor funds. Procurement and
- 27-



financial management capability assessments of the various AgSSIP implementing agencies has
determined that there is an adequate number of skilled staff to carry out these functions
satisfactorily, except at the district level where a program of staff training needs to be undertaken.
Such training would be launched before credit effectiveness (Annex 2).
4.2 Project management:
Total responsibility for project implementation would reside in MOFA, which already has a
strong central Project Coordinating Unit within the PPMED that is providing procurement,
disbursement and accounting services to all MOFA externally-funded projects. This Unit will be
transformed into the Program Coordination Division and strengthened to provide common
services to all agencies implementing components of AgSSIP. The Unit's staff have been given
both formal training on Bank procurement and disbursement procedures. MOFA's finance and
accounting staff have dealt with IDA-funded projects for the last two decades. A new financial
software would be installed at MOFA to enable systematic and efficient accounting and reporting
of expenditures on all development programs implemented under MOFA. CSIR staff have been
trained in Bank procurement guidelines and procedures and a computerized accounting system
established under the erstwhile Bank-funded National Agricultural Research Project.
4.3 Procurement issues:
Procurement Capacity Assessment. Procurement under AgSSIP would be carried out by
PCD, PU/CSIR and other implementation units [referred to hereafter as implementation units] i.e.
Regional and District teams and Research Institutes of CSIR. These arrangements are in line with
the policy of decentralized program implementation. The Bank has carried out a procurement
capacity assessment of the PCD and PU/CSIR, which would be responsible for procurement
planning and monitoring, procurement of items to procured centrally and for providing support to
the implementation units. The capacity of PCD and PU/CS1R was rated fair and the risk low.
The capacity of other implementing units has not been assessed as part of AgSSIP appraisal but
their capacity is assessed as adequate for this project as evidenced by their performance under
previous projects, i.e. the Agriculture Extension Project and the National Agricultural Research
Project. Weaknesses in their capacity would be minimized by support from the PCD and
PU/CSIR, and mandatory use of the detailed procurement and financial procedures in the Project
Implementation Manual (P1M) by all implementing institutions/agencies. Overall procurement
arrangements and capacity are rated adequate to meet the needs ofAgSSIP. Annex 6 provides
detailed procurement arrangements.
Procurement Planning. Except for sub-projects under the Agriculture Extension Grants and
FBOs Development Fund, draft global procurement plans covering the three year project period
and annual procurement plans for the first two years of the project (showing contract packages
and for each package its estimated cost, procurement method, and dates for completing key
processing steps from completion of bidding documents to completion of delivery) have been
prepared by the PCD and the Procurement Unit of the CSIR [PU/CSIR]. These plans would be
finalized and made part of the PIM. By September 30 of each year, PCD and PU/CSIR would
prepare and/or update and send to IDA for review and comments the annual procurement plans
for the following calendar year as part of the annual work program. The various implementation
-28 -



units [see implementation arrangements] would prepare their annual procurement plans and send
them to PCD and PU/CSIR for incorporation into the annual work program and for ease of
reference in monitoring procurement.
Procurement Implementation. Procurement of goods, works and services under the
subprojects will be carried out under arrangements specified in the PIM and in Annex 2 of the
Project Appraisal Document. The DCO will be responsible only for monitoring and guiding the
implementation of the subprojects under the Development Funds, ensuring participation of FBO
Committee members in specific procurement steps, i.e. preparation and appraisal of subprojects,
processing and award of contracts, supervision and certification of completed contracts. Use of
NGOs for procurement processing and service delivery will be encouraged at all levels.
4.4 Financial management issues:
Summary of Financial Management Assessment
Background. The Government of Ghana is currently undertaking major financial and
structural reforms to improve the control environment of its public sector accounting and
reporting systems. The Auditor General's Department, which is the supreme audit institution in
the country, responsible for the auditing of the GOG accounts (the consolidated fund), and for all
government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), is also included in these reforms.
Following these reforms it is believed that the overall control environment within the public
sector, which is currently weak, will improve as the ongoing reforms begin to take effect.
To date, the reforms have resulted in the introduction of the MTEF budgeting system in the
country and work is progressing to computerize GOG's accounting system. All MDAs are now
required to prepare their budgets using the MTEF. The GOG budgets for 1999 and 2000 have
been prepared using this new budgeting system.
Project Implementation Arrangements. Three sector ministries (MOFA, MEST and
MIESW), the private sector, community-based organizations, NGOs and a number of think tanks
(CSR, ISSER, CEPA and university faculties) will be involved in the implementation of AgSSIP.
The Program Co-ordination Division within the PPMED of MOFA would be the lead agency
co-ordinating the overall implementation through the provision of financial control, procurement,
monitoring, evaluation and reporting services. The Research component under the program will
be implemented by CSIR. The PCD will receive periodic reports from CSIR to enable them to
consolidate and present all the needed reports to the oversight committee and all donors. The
overall organization and management structure for implementation of AgSSIP would be
consistent with Government's decentralized local government and rural development system,
which has started to devolve power and responsibility of central government to the 10 regional
councils and 110 district assemblies.
Agricultural services provided under the AgSSIP and resources required to implement them
would be channeled in agreed arrangements that would reinforce and support GOG's
decentralization program. The delivery of agricultural services will take place at the district level
and to some extent at the regional level. In the case of the Research components which would be
- 29 -



carried out by the participating research institutions and coordinated by the CSIR secretariat
would also reinforce the existing administrative reporting arrangements.
Budgeting Under the Project. The budget of MOFA for the period 2001 to 2003 will be
prepared using the MTEF and will include the funds to be provided under the AgSSIP program.
Although the AgSSIP resources will be part of MOFA' s budget, funds under the program will
not be released as part of GOG budgetary resources, but a parallel financial system will be put in
place to manage the program funds. Districts will be required to prepare their annual programs
and related budgets for funding under the AgSSIP.
Financial Management. In line with the decentralized implementation arrangements and
moving the Finance Unit to PPMED, MOFA has engaged a consultant to review its current
financial management system in line with this new arrangement. This system should be capable of
accurately recording and reporting on information on all the resources and expenditures under to
program (this should include GOG and all donor resources) and in conformity with the World
Bank's requirements for accounting, auditing and project management reporting. The system will
also be capable of identifying the source of funding for different activities or tracing what
activities were financed by specific donor funds.
Since the program recognizes that any funds flow arrangements will require that the
weaknesses at the district level as identified in previous work, such as inadequate skills,
insufficient and untimely financial reporting, lack of forward planning and in adequate supervisory
and control oversight over financial resources, will be addressed through training and
strengthening of financial management at the district level, in collaboration with other sector
programs.
MOFA has compiled the list of the profile of the district accounts staff, their qualifications,
and their training needs, to ensure that any training will be both relevant and comprehensive and
achieve the objective of improving the skills, recording and reporting from the districts level. We
have reviewed this list and noted that some Districts Directorates of Agriculture are without
accounting staff. Accounting staff must be sent to these offices before resources are sent to the
identified Districts.
The CSIR will be responsible for the implementation and financial management of the
Research component under the program. Under a previous project, the National Agricultural
Research Project (NARP), CSIR has been equipped with a computerized accounting system and
financial procedures manual for its operations, which is functioning effectively and meeting all the
financial reporting requirements of CSIR. The manual has been reviewed and found to be
adequate to meet the accounting requirements under this component. The computerized system
will be modified to be able to provide the additional financial reporting requirements under
AgSSIP. The accounting system will also be modified to enable CSIR to generate the PMRs
within an agreed time table.
Accounting Process. The project books of accounts will be kept on cash basis. In addition, a
memorandum statement will be kept for all unpaid liabilities to ensure that all project liabilities are
- 30 -



recorded and accounted for. MOFA shall maintain a fixed assets register for all its assets, and
especially for the program assets. PCD within the PPMED will be responsible for co-ordinating
financial information, flow of funds to the districts and ensuring timely reporting from the districts
of the program (all except the research component) on a regular basis. As implementation will
take place at the district level, the district accounting staff will be responsible for recording the
books at the district level and submitting regular statement of expenditures on the program
activities to the finance unit in Accra. As part of the PIM, a modified financial and accounting
procedures manual which documents this new decentralized operations of the financial
management system is being prepared. The manual will detail the new budgeting, accounting,
reporting arrangements and funds flow mechanism from the center to the regions and districts
under the program and the recording and reporting responsibilities required for releases of funds
at each level of implementation.
The finance unit will be equipped to maintain a computerized project financial management
system. This will also aid the preparation of PMRs.
CSIR will use its existing structures to account for resources under the program. This will be
done in a manner that will allow donors as well as GOG resources to be accounted for separately.
Staffing Arrangement. Although MOFA has decentralized its operations, the overall GOG
decentralization process in incomplete, and as such resources for the implementation of the
AgSSIP (at least for the first phase) program will not be channeled through the existing budgetary
system. It is expected that during this first phase, disbursement of funds from MOFA HQ (the
center) to the district MOFA departments and accounting for them will be done through a parallel
system similar to that operating currently through the PCU.
The finance unit will be headed by a financial controller who must be an experienced and
qualified accountant with adequate experience in both IDA and GOG systems (TOR has been
prepared). The financial controller must be capable of planning, designing and implementing
training programs for junior staff in the unit, and setting up of financial accounting systems. The
current financial controller at the old PCU will continue as the financial controller for AgSSIP
until a new financial controller is appointed, preferably from the Controller and Accountants'
General Department. Four other accounting staff, who must be partly qualified accountants with
adequate experiences in IDA and GOG accounting systems requirements, would help the financial
controller. The staff profiles of all accounting staff provided by the Ministry of Agriculture have
been reviewed and four such key staff have been nominated to assist the financial controller.
As the accounting functions at the district level will be performed by the Ministry's district
account officers, a similar assessment of the district accounting staff has been carried out to
identify the quality, availability and adequacy to carry out the tasks required under the program.
Areas where no such staff exist have been identified for action.
The CSIR overall accounting function is headed by a Director of Finance, with several
divisions including one responsible for projects undertaken by CSIR. This unit has a team of four
accounting staff, the senior is partly qualified with the institute of chartered accountants Ghana,
- 31 -



and an M.Sc. in Finance. The rest have varying qualifications (1 degree in accounting and 2
A-level accounting holders), and have worked on previous Bank funded projects, thereby
acquiring the needed experiences. The present staff strength and experiences are adequate to
undertake accounting activities under AgSSIP.
Control Risks Areas Identified. Due to the decentralized implementation arrangements
which will require accounting staff in the districts to submit accounting information to the center
for consolidation, there is the risk that the financial information will not be submitted in a timely
manner, and reporting under the PMR system will be delayed.
All the accounting staff at the Districts have been seconded to the districts by the Controller
and Accountant General's Department (C&AGD), who have the responsibility of re-posting them
to other departments. In this regard there is a further risk that trained District Accounting staff
will be transferred, and be replaced by other staff who will require new training.
Auditing Arrangements. The audit of the project will be conducted annually and carried out
by independent and qualified auditors acceptable to the Bank. The selection of auditors shall be
on competitive basis in accordance with the Bank's consultants' selection guidelines. The audit
report will be submitted to the Bank within 5 months after the end of the reporting period. The
terms of reference for the audit will require the auditors to provide in their report separate
opinions on: (i) the project financial statements to ensure that program funds have been used in
accordance with the DCA; (ii) that the SOEs submitted for reimbursement during the year, are
properly supported by formal contracts and invoices and other relevant documents; (iii) that the
project special account (SA) have been operated in accordance with IDA procedures and have
been used for the payment of eligible expenditures.
As there will be two SA, the audit will be required to report and issue opinions on each SA
separately, and this fact should be contained in the terms of reference.
Project Monitoring and Reporting. The Bank has introduced a new initiative, the LACI,
which has been formally launched in Ghana and it is expected that all projects will comply fully
with this new requirement at the start of implementation, or put in place an action plan to ensure
compliance in 12 to 18 months of commencement of implementation. LACI requires projects to
prepare quarterly PMRs in the areas of finance, procurements including contract details and
project progress.
The Quarterly Financial Report consists of Sources of funds and their Uses of Funds,
statement of Uses of Funds by Project Activity, Project Cash Withdrawals, Special Account
Reconciliation statement and a six months Project Cash Forecast. The Quarterly Project
Progress Report consists of Output Monitoring Report on contract Management and on Unit of
Output by project activity. The Quarterly Procurement Management Report consists of
procurement process monitoring for goods and works and consultants' services and expenditures
on these.
The financial management assessment conducted for the project revealed that the project will
- 32-



not be able to produce all the required project management reports at effectiveness date. An
action plan has been agreed upon at negotiations to make the program compliant 12 months after
project effectiveness.
5. Environmental:              Environmental Category: B (Partial Assessment)
5.1 Summrnize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment and EMP preparation (including
consultation and disclosure) and the significant issues and their treatnent emerging from this analysis.
Programs implernented under AgSSIP will pay special attention to mainstreaming gender
issues in research and extension as well as in the development of FBOs. Indeed, women play a
major role in the production of food crops and cottage industry processing of food and a major
social issue is the extent to which they will participate and benefit from the technology generation
and diffusion process and the development of FBOs. Diffusion of already existing improved
technologies in village poultry, pigs and small ruminants will largely benefit women because these
species are mainly reared by them. Research and extension on post-harvest and value added
processing technologies will be intensified and targeted at women. Adaptation and diffusion of
appropriate technology will also emphasize tools, implements and equipment that would increase
the productivity of women and release some time from farm production chores to home-making
activities.
Facilities will be expanded and efforts increased in enrolling women students in the
agricultural colleges so that the number of women extension agents would be augmented.
Extension agents will be given special training to increase their awareness of the importance of
women in agricultural production and on techniques of diagnosis of women farmers' needs as well
as diffusion of extension messages to women farmers, particularly through existing women social
groups. Women groups will receive special attention under the FBO development program.
They will receive training in literacy and numeracy and in organizational and financial
management of FBOs and small enterprises.
The research and extension programs focus on farming systems and non-tradable crops of
resource poor smallholders who will benefit from the program.  The FBO development
component will empower smallholders to more effectively bargain in the marketplace and
socio-political arena where decisions affecting their livelihood and welfare are taken.
A strategic environmental impact assessment (ELA) of AgSSIP was conducted to assess the
environmental impact of each of its component against three sets of environmental parameters, i.e.
ecological, natural resources and socio-economic/health implications. This EIA is available in
project files. The conclusion of the EIA indicates that AgSSIP activities will have minimum
adverse impacts on the environment and that most of the impacts that may result would be
ephemeral in nature. The program has in-built environmental conservation measures which seek
to address potential negative impacts that may ensue as the program is implemented:
* Promotion of farming systems and practices that would ensure sustainable use of the
natural resources, based on on-farm adaptive research programs suitable for each
agro-ecological zone, with a focus on solving high priority problems in soil and water
management
* Creation of new technical specialist positions in natural resources; social science and
- 33 -



monitoring and evaluation within the agricultural research management to ensure that
research findings and packages are environmentally and socially compatible;
*  Provision of support for a national strategy in biotechnology and regulatory framework for
bio-safety and intellectual property rights;
*  Provision of training for pesticide producers, importers and distributors in the proper use
and application of pesticides and in adherence to the Pesticide Control and Management
Act of 1996;
*  A program for improvement of communal grazing areas; and
*  Commitment to prepare environmental impact assessment for some program activities
such as community-based tsetse control.
A few specific environmental concerns were identified as possible negative impact from the
implementation of AgSSIP. These include: (i) the possible degradation of productive systems and
maintenance of natural resource base in areas where horticultural crops would be grown; (ii)
socio-economic and health implications of livestock development, e.g. unreported and
uncontrolled incidence of livestock disease; and (iii) the potential adverse impact on water quality
from aquaculture development. AgSSIP design includes specific mitigation measures to minimize
these potential adverse effects; and (iv) misuse and abuse of pesticides which would increase as
farmers intensify their production. However, AgSSlP interventions would not result in massive
increase of agro-chemicals as their use in Ghana is very low. Fertilizer use, at about 4 kg per
hectare is among the lowest in Africa. Pesticide use averages at less than 1,500 tons per year,
mostly on cocoa and horticultural production. Agrochemical use in other crops is restricted to
application of fertilizer and post harvest pest control.
Ghana's plant and animal protection strategies emphasize the adoption of IPM, a pest control
and management package that combines various biological, chemical and crop rotation techniques
and seeks synergies in controlling pest populations. There are sufficient skills, knowledge and
experience in country to scale up the methodologies packaged under 1PM. It is possible to
minimize pesticide misuse and abuse with enhanced education and training targeted at entire
population and applying effectively the checks and balances provided for in existing legislation. As
people become more aware of the dangers and the alternatives to pesticides, including the third
generation pesticides that are purely plant or micro-organism based, dependence on and use of
chemical pesticides would be minimized. Currently the Plant Protection and Regulatory Services
Directorate (PPRSD has deployed 25 such inspectors at strategic stations in the country. At the
regional level, Regional Agricultural Development Officers have the additional responsibility as
Regional Coordinators for Pesticides Management to ensure enforcement and compliance with
the Act and monitoring and evaluation of pesticide use. These officers would also train subject
matter specialists, conduct seminars at agricultural colleges and organize workshops for private
sector personnel on the safe use of agro-chemicals and on adherence to the Act.
In conclusion, Ghana's agricultural pest management strategy promotes the use of biological
and environmental control methods, reducing reliance on synthetic chemical pesticides. The
country's regulatory framework and institutional capacity is adequate to promote and support
safe, effective and environmentally sound pest management. AgSSIP would further enhance this
capacity through providing facilities and logistical support for research, training and regulatory
-34 -



services, including enforcement of Ghana's environmental regulations and environmental action
plan.
5.2 What are the main features of the EMP and are they adequate?
Assurances were obtainedfrom MOFA that the following measures will be implemented in
close collaboration with district, regional and national officers of the EPA to ensure that the
program interventions are environmentally sustainable in the long-term:
*  MOFA will develop a strategy to mainstream environmental considerations related to
agriculture into its programn activities at all levels;
*  MOFA will appoint an Environment Officer to ensure the intemalization of environmental
issues in its operations. This officer will liaise with the Environment Protection Agency
(EPA) on environmental aspects of their directorates' activities and EPA will provide
orientation training for the officer,
*  MOFA will develop, in collaboration with EPA, environmental guidelines or simple
environmental manuals in specific areas (e.g. aquaculture, livestock, introduction of exotic
species, agro-chemical use, integrated pest management, agro-forestry, irrigation, etc.) to
guide field officers, especially at the district level;
-  Environmental aspects of agricultural programs and activities will be emphasized in the
training of agricultural officers and extension messages;
3  Model sustainable land use systems for different ecological zones will be developed, based
on land capability;
3  The PPRSD of MOFA and EPA's Chemicals Control and Management Center will be
equipped to train extension officers on the safe use of agro-chemicals and on adherence to
the Pesticide Control and Management Act of 1996;
3  An early warning information system would be setup by the RSID of MOFA, in
collaboration with the Metreological Service, to make advance information available about
anticipated effects of droughts and other natural hazards such as floods, fire, and
outbreaks of plant and animal diseases (based on the GIS data base developed for Ghana
under the Bank assisted Environment Project); and
* Environmental impact assessments would be prepared for some program activities such as
community-based tsetse control and aquaculture development.
5.3 For Category A and B projects, timeline and status of EA:
Date of receipt of final draft: May 30, 2000
5.4 How have stakeholders been consulted at the stage of (a) environmental screening and (b) draft EA
report on the environmental impacts and proposed environment management plan? Describe mechanisms
of consultation that were used and which groups were consulted?
The EA was prepared under the auspices of the EPA. Key officials of EPA and MOFA at
their headquarters and in the field were consulted. Farmers, NGOs and experts participating in
the Ghana National Integrated Crop and Pest Management and Farmners' Field Schools (IPM/FSS)
were also consulted. The consultants preparing the EA participated in the (IPM/FSS) workshop
held in December 1999.

5.5 What mechanisms have been established to monitor and evaluate the impact of the project on the
environment? Do the indicators reflect the objectives and results of the EMP?
Yes. The monitoring and evaluation system that will be implemented involves environmental
indicators.
6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.
Programs implemented under AgSSIP will pay special attention to mainstreaming gender
issues in research and extension as well as in the development of FBOs. Indeed, women play a
major role in the production of food crops and cottage industry processing of food and a major
social issue is the extent to which they will participate and benefit from the technology generation
and diffusion process and the development of farmer-based organizations (FBOs). Diffusion of
already existing improved technologies in village poultry, pigs and small ruminants will largely
benefit women because these species are mainly reared by them. Research and extension on
post-harvest and value added processing technologies will be intensified and targeted at women.
Adaptation and diffusion of appropriate technology will also emphasize tools, implements and
equipment that would increase the productivity of women and release some time from farm
production chores to home-making activities.
6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participating in the project?
Facilities will be expanded and efforts increased in enrolling women students in the
agricultural colleges so that the number of women extension agents would be augmented.
Extension agents will be given special training to increase their awareness of the importance of
women in agricultural production and on techniques of diagnosis of women farmers' needs as well
as diffusion of extension messages to women farmers, particularly through existing women social
groups. Women groups will receive special attention under the FBO development program.
They will receive training in literacy and numeracy and in organizational and financial
management of FBOs and small enterprises.
6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?
The research and extension programs focus on farming systems and non-tradable crops of
resource poor smallholders who will benefit from  the program.  The FBO development
component will empower smallholders to more effectively bargain in the marketplace and
socio-political arena where decisions affecting their livelihood and welfare are taken.
6.4 What institutional arrangements have been provided to ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?
MOFA has established a Gender Desk to ensure gender issues are mainstreamed in its
activities. The Women In Agriculture Development Department is charged with the responsibility
of packaging technologies of particular importance to women and training agricultural extension
agents in their diffusion.
6.5 How will the project monitor perfonnance in terms of social development outcomes?
In addition to the social welfare indicators of the Ghana Living Standard Survey reports,

periodic beneficiary assessments and impact evaluation will be conducted by academic and
research institutions, NGOs and private sector consultants.

Direct Beneficiaries and other Stakeholders.  Farming communities were consulted
extensively throughout the ten regions at the time the accelerated agricultural growth strategy was
being formulated. They were asked to prioritize the problems they face and indicate what should
be done about them. Their concerns as well as lessons from the beneficiary assessment of the
National Agricultural Extension Project, which closed in 1999, were incorporated in the design of
AgSSIP. The Agriculture Committee of Parliament, Ghana National Farmers and Fishermen
Association, NGOs, input suppliers, traders, exporters, agribusiness and the academic and
research community were represented in the AgSSIP Task Force (TF) that oversaw AgSSIP
preparation. Consultations were held with the Ghana Cooperative Council and representatives of
farmer-based organizations in designing the proposals for the development of FBOs. The
institutional and policy reforms and the program for agricultural research were designed in close
consultation with the rank and file of the National Agricultural Research System (NARS). The
institutional reforms in decentralizing the services of MOFA was a long consultative process,
involving all cadres of the ministry, and selected district assemblies. This was reinforced by the
consultations and workshops held during the institutional assessment of MOFA.

F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Increased participation of beneficiaries in the governance and funding of research and
extension programs and privatization of selected agricultural services will enhance the
client-responsiveness, relevance and sustainability of the program. Increased productivity in the
agricultural sector and the ensuing stimulation of the economy will generate additional tax
revenue for the government and the increased emphasis on cost recovery from beneficiaries and
privatization of services will decrease the need for public financing of the program, and therefore
contribute to its fiscal sustainability.
2. Critical Risks (reflecting assumptions in the fourth column of Annex 1):

Annex 2: Project Description
GHANA: Agricultural Services Subsector Investment Project
The first phase of AgSSIP (AgSSIP- Phase I) comprises four inter-related thematic
components supporting and reinforcing the development of multiple and demand-driven
agricultural s-% -ices for rapid agricultural growth and poverty reduction. These components are:
(i) reforming and strengthening the agricultural technology generation and diffusion systems; (ii)
institutional reform - restructuring and strengthening- of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture;
(iii) development of farmer-based organizations; and (1v) strengthening agricultural education and
training. The envisaged institutional reform of MOFA would facilitate the diffusion of technology
by devolving decision making on planning and implementing agricultural development programs
to the district assembl:es that are close to the grassroots level. The capacity of MOFA would be
improved to render effective technical backstopping and training services to the subject matter
specialists that play key roles in diffusion of technology and adaptive research. MOFA's central
services of policy formulation, planning, compilation and dissemination of agricultural statistics
and information, provision of regulatory services and impact evaluation of agricultural policy
interventions and development programs would be strengthened to support the private sector in
agricultural production, processing and marketing.
The development of FBOs would enable farmers create economies of scale for cost-effective
acquisition of technology and inputs, securing credit and processing and marketing agricultural
produce, thereby creating opportunities for increasing their incomes. FBOs would enable farmers
to better articulate their needs and concerns and empower them to negotiate effectively with
development agents and social service providers on issues affecting their welfare. Strengthening
agricultural education and training would provide skilled agricultural manpower, particularly for
the private sector, facilitating the use of technology for boosting agricultural production,
processing and marketing.
By Component:
Project Component I - US$77.95 million
Technology Generation and Diffusion: Rapid agricultural technology generation and
diffusion in order to accelerate agricultural growth that results in increased food security, reduced
poverty and conservation of the natural resource base through intensification of agricultural
production is at the core of AgSSIP. This component is therefore the main thrust of AgSSIP
Phase-L with components 2 and 4 largely designed to provide technical backstopping, regulatory
services, training, agricultural statistics and inforrnation as well as monitoring and impact
evaluation services in a supporting role. The component comprises two sub-components, i.e.
agricultural research and agricultural extension. It also includes support to the regions and
districts in planning and implementing their agricultural extension and development programs.
Sub-Component 1. Agricultural Research.  Ghana established its agricultural research
before independence and it participated actively in the West African inter-territorial research
system. Agricultural research continued to develop until it was disrupted by the deterioration of
the political and economic situation in the country in the 1970s, which led to two decades of
serious under-funding during the 1970-1990 period, when the research infrastructure deteriorated
- 51 -



and a large number of experienced scientists left the system. Several donor-assisted projects were
launched since 1989 to rehabilitate the NARS. The major initiatives for this were the savanna
agricultural research program with GTZ support, the grains and legumes improvement program
supported by CLDA and the National Agricultural Research Project (NARP) supported by DflD
and IDA.
The research infrastructure was rehabilitated, a large number of scientists trained in-country
and abroad and a library and information system developed under these initiatives. A reasonably
working NARS has been established, forging multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional
collaboration by researchers in the nine national agricultural research institutes, the four national
universities, and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA). The national agricultural
research strategic plan was prepared in 1994, using criteria reflecting the agricultural development
priorities of Ghana. Seventeen commodity and factor research programs were initiated, each of
them having national coordinating committees, comprising the leading researchers in these fields.
Program budgeting has been introduced for carrying out these programs and a reasonably well
functioning system of accounting and financial control has been put in place. The Agriculture,
Fisheries and Forestry Sector Directorate (AFFSD) of the CSIR was established to coordinate the
review of research proposals, their funding, quality assurance and accountability in the use of
research funds.
The agricultural research component of AgSSIP would continue to support the ongoing
agricultural research programs formulated by the long-term national agricultural research strategic
plan. The research priorities would be reviewed on an ongoing basis using the priority setting
mechanism that has been developed and that would be revised periodically. The lessons learnt in
implementing NARP have been incorporated in the design, particularly with respect to research
governance and quality control of research activities. A research management manual has been
prepared to guide scientists and managers of research program in the processes involved from
research protocol preparation to writing-up of the results and their dissemination.
The objectives of the agricultural research component are to: (i) increase agricultural
productivity and reduce poverty at an accelerated pace through the release and uptake of new
technologies; (ii) promote intensification of farming systems to conserve and enhance the natural
resources base; (iii) increase participation of farmers and other key stakeholders in the governance
and financing of the NARS to make agricultural research more relevant to farmers' and the
country's needs as well as financially sustainable, and (iv) improving the cost-effectiveness of
research by increasing the efficiency of research organizations in the NARS via strengthening their
technical, administrative, planning, monitoring, and financial management capabilities.
Users of agricultural services would participate in setting research priorities and in funding of
agricultural research services to ensure that they are demand-driven, reflect national development
priorities and farmers' needs, and are sensitive to sustainable use of Ghana's natural resources.
Farmer-based organizations and agribusiness would be represented on the boards of research
institutions and in research policy committees - the National Agricultural Research Policy
Committee and the five zoned Research/Extension Liaison Committees (RELCs).
- 52-



At present, all agricultural research, except cocoa, is funded by the Government of Ghana
(GOG) and by donors. In the case of cocoa, producers finance research by applying a levy on the
FOB price of cocoa. Under the AgSSIP, producers and exporters of cash crops such as oil palm
and palm oil, fruits and vegetables, cotton, coffee, yam, sheanut butter, etc., as well as
agribusiness will finance an increasing part of the cost of research for these commodities. To
support the initiative, management of the NARS will be improved to make services cost effective
and accountable.  The program includes establishing a competitive agricultural research grant
scheme that will provide research funds on the merit and excellence of the research proposal.
Strengthening Agricultural Research Management and Infrastructure. In order to provide
better linkage between national agricultural research policy and the national objectives for the
agriculture sector, an Agricultural Research Policy Committee (ARPC) will be established. The
committee will be composed of 12 persons and will include the Director General of CSIR,
members of the CSIR council who have agricultural expertise, and the Ministry of Environment,
Science and Technology. Key stakeholders from outside the Council will be co-opted to the
ARPC to broaden its representation and will include a dean from the agriculture faculty of a
university, the Director of Extension, MOFA representatives, farmers and agri-business
representatives, the Technical Director of the Forestry Departnent of the Ministry of Land and
Forests. The DDG (AFFSD) will act as Secretary. The ARPC will meet at least once a year to
review the overall workplan and budget for the NARS. It will also assist in raising funds for
agricultural research from the public and private sectors. The AFFSD will also be responsible for
carrying out analyses of commodity research priorities during each phase of the AgSSIP to
provide input to decision-makers on national research priorities for follow-up phases. Existing
committees - the consultative management committee (CMC) and the national program
coordinating committees (NPCCs) of the national commodity and factor research programs - will
continue to advise the AFFSD on the management of the NARS. The terms of reference of these
ARPC and these committees is given in the Program Implementation Manual. Under the recently
decentralized extension system, new methods will be developed to promote better linkages
between researchers, extension agents and farmers using a participatory, bottom-up approach,
starting at the district level. A manual has been prepared to guide the operations of the five zoned
RELCs in order to strengthen these linkages.
In addition, the component will also strengthen the AFFSD by creating new positions for
senior technical specialists in crops and horticulture, livestock and fisheries, natural resources,
social science, and monitoring and evaluation to be responsible for quality assurance of research
during inception of research protocols, supervision of their implementation and dissemination of
the results. Training to develop skills in priority setting, monitoring and evaluation would be
provided through short-term technical assistance and short courses in-country and abroad.
The national research programs would be restructured to include: (i) National commodity
programs to carry out research on 13 priority commodities which were identified as priority areas
in the national agricultural research strategic plan; (ii) national factor programs to support
research on soils and agricultural engineering that are applicable to all commodities; (iii) natural
resource management (NRM) programs by agro-ecological zones to deal with high priority
problems in soil and water management, and soil fertility in particular; these programs will be
- 53-



piloted in the savanna zone and the forest/transitional zone during Phase I; (iv) national social
science program for research on social science issues (agricultural marketing and policy cutting
across commodities and zones) for which funds will be provided through the commodity and
NRM programs to ensure proper integration of social science perspectives; and (v) on-farm
adaptive research programs for each agro-ecological zone.
Modest support will be provided for upgrading laboratories, reviewing capacity and needs and
for formulating a national strategic plan for developing biotechnology capacity over the next 10
years, including a regulatory framework of intellectual property rights and biosafety. Emphasis
will be placed on developing a national center of excellence and short-term technical assistance
will be provided to support this initiative. Once the strategy is in place, funding will be provided
under the AgSSIP for investment in equipment and operating costs.
Competitive Agricultural Research Grant Scheme (CARGS). Phase I of the AgSSIP will
support demand-driven research which is complementary to the priority research programs. At
least two types of research and development would be included, (i) strategic research targeted at
problems of national importance, and (ii) downstream research and development, (e.g. pilot
projects demonstrating potential for improved technologies or for development into commercial
products). The scheme would promote partnerships between research and non-research groups in
the private sector and non-government community, and support international research
collaboration, e.g., the scheme will fund pilots to develop and market research products in
collaboration with the private sector and NGOs to facilitate rapid technology transfer and explore
possibilities for cost recovery in such likely areas as seed production and dissemination.
Depending on its success, increasing amounts of the operating costs of core research programs
would be shifted to CARGs to promote excellence in research. Ability to win grants from
CARGS and attract extemal funding would be factors in determining career development of
researchers in the NARS.
During Phase I, operating costs of research for commercial crops (cotton, pineapple, and oil
palm) will be maintained, following which they will be made available on the basis of a matching
grant to industry contributions. Subsequently, during Phase m, research on such commodities
will be supported only through matching grants. AgSSIP will support these transitions through
technical assistance and funding of industry consultations.
The ARPC will provide policy guidance for the CARGS. A CARGS board will award the
grants on the basis of the criteria detailed in the CARGS manual and professional peer reviews of
the proposals submitted to the scheme. This board will have significant representation from the
agricultural research clientele in Ghana. The lessons drawn from Phase I would be used to
scale-up during Phase U and to expand the competitive research grant to funding part of the core
research programs.
Human Resources Development. Funding will be provided for training 74 staff over a
nine-year period, out of which 31 will be PhDs. Foreign training (about 20 percent of total
training) will be restricted to a few specialized fields which national universities cannot provide.
Locally-trained post graduates will be encouraged to participate in 6-12 month programs in
advanced regional or international research centers or universities to keep abreast of
- 54-



state-of-the-art developments. The human resources development strategy will emphasize (i)
competitive awards of training fellowships, (ii) post-graduate training awards as an incentive for
good performance, (iii) training primarily at national universities, (tv) thesis research on Ghanaian
problems for extemal Ph.D. awards; and (v) acceptance for presentation of a poster session or
paper as a requirement for granting fellowships to attend regional or international conferences.
Library and Information Systen. The program will provide funds to train staff and users of
the Ghana Agricultural Information Network System (GAINS) to access and use information and
resources available in the system. GAINS was established under the NARP and had developed a
computerized database (GHAGRI) for Ghanaian literature on agriculture and related disciplines,
linkages with other regional and international databases, and inter-library loans. AgSSIP will also
provide funds to update and improve linkages with agricultural databases such as CABI, AGRIS,
CTA, and the CGLAR centers, and universities worldwide for researchers. The GHAGRI
database would be updated and documents will be scanned to make them readily available
electronically. GAINS would market network products and services to various users and issue a
semi-annual publication. Use of GAINS products will be monitored at libraries and through
surveys to gauge user needs. Efforts will be made to make the GAINS operations sustainable in
the long run.
Sub-Component 2. Agricultural Extension. Under this component, the program will
provide services which are demand-driven and responsive to client needs to encourage users to
adopt improved technologies. To accomplish these objectives, the program will build on the
positive lessons of the IDA-financed National Agricultural Extension Services Project and will
mainstream the following concerns: (i) articulation of a national agricultural extension policy; (ii)
client empowerment and private sector participation in delivery of extension services; (iii) gender
and equity considerations; (iv) participation of extension staff in the prevention and control of
IVWAIDS; (v) linkages with sources of agricultural technology; and (vi) management and
organization of extension services.
The national agricultural extension system will be reformed to incorporate the government's
policy on decentralization and to clarify the division of tasks, and financing between the public
and private sectors. The program will provide support to the national Directorate of Agricultural
Extension Services (DAES) and the regional and district directorates of agriculture, and will fund
staff and farmer training, study tours, technical assistance, linkage with research and agri-business,
civil works for office buildings and staff accommodation in the field, transport, equipment, and for
operational expenditures. It will support the private sector to provide or co-provide extension
services.
Policy and Institutional Issues. The GOG's letter of agricultural development policy will
articulate the roles of the public and the private sector in diffusing agricultural technology. This
will encourage judicious use of resources and avoid duplication of roles. MOFA has drafted a
separate agricultural extension policy document clearly defining how private sector participation
in the delivery of extension services would be promoted; how agricultural extension services in
Ghana would be organized, managed, monitored and evaluated; and how cross-cutting issues such
as equity and gender would be mainstreamed. The document also clarifies the roles of MOFA,
- 55-



the regional directorates of agriculture and the district assemblies in the provision of extension
services. Assurance was obtained from MOFA that this policy document would be finalized by
December 31, 2000 after extensive consultation with stakeholders.
Client empowerment and Private Sector Participation. Users of agricultural extension
services will participate in setting priorities and in influencing decisions on the organization and
management of extension services. RELCs will include representatives from FBOs and
agribusiness. Producers and exporters of cash crops such as oil palm and palm oil, fruits and
vegetables, cotton, coffee, yam, sheanut butter, etc., and agribusiness entities would be
encouraged to finance an increasing part of the extension services costs on these commodities.
The private sector in Ghana is already providing extension services successfully in tree crops such
as oil palm and rubber, where the entire cost is borne by the outgrowers through deductions of the
sales revenue of their commodities. Such pluralism in the delivery of extension services would be
promoted so that capable FBOs and NGOs would be contracted to provide extension services. In
this manner, the management of the national agricultural extension system and its accountability
would be improved and strengthened to make extension services cost-effective.
During Phase I of AgSSIP, steps would be taken to prepare district assemblies to assume
responsibility for the supervision and funding of extension services and farmers' representatives to
have a greater voice in determining extension programs. An Agricultural Extension Development
Fund of US$5.0 million would be established under Phase I of AgSSIP for contracting out of
extension services. The Fund would be administered by a Board of Trustees with strong
participation of farmer and agri-business representatives. Assurances were obtained from MOFA
that a draft manual for the management of the Agricultural Extension Fund, acceptable to donors,
elaborating; (i) the terms of reference and composition of the Board of Trustees; (ii) the criteria
for eligibility of applicants and for award of contracts; (iii) the procedures for funds withdrawal
from the Fund's account in a commercial bank and disbursement to contractors; and (iv) the
monitoring and evaluation of contractors' performance would be prepared by June 30, 2000 and
the Board of Trustees inaugurated by August 31, 2000. PCD of MOFA will responsible for
supervising adherence to the guidelines of the manual in awarding contracts to service providers
in collaboration with the Directorate of Extension. The Fund would be audited by the external
auditors of AgSSIP as part of the expenditures under the extension component.
Gender and Equity Considerations. Despite the key role women play in agriculture,
traditions and customs negatively affect womens activities in agriculture and limit their access to
land, technology, credit, training, skills acquisition and labor. AgSSIP would support gender
sensitization training for all extension staff. MOFA would develop strategies to increase female
enrollment in the agricultural colleges and ensure that students pursue a uniform study curriculum,
irrespective of gender. Women facilitators from the women farming community would serve as
focal points for reaching women in the communities. Technological messages on which they can
be proficient would be identified and training given to them. The introduction of appropniate labor
saving mechanisms suited for women farmers and food processors would be the focus of the
appropriate technology program so that they would have more time for homemaking activities.
Agricultural Extension Linkages in Technology Development. To promote demand-driven
- 5f-



extension services and quality control through strong participation from farmers and clients,
committees would be set up at the district level to ensure adequate representation from men and
women farmers, traders, input suppliers and agro-processors to participate in RELC functions.
This will ensure problems and concerns of stakeholders at the grassroots level would be taken into
account in determining the on-station research and on-farm adaptive trials and that the extension
service would disseminate the results arising therefrom. A manual of operation for RELCs and the
conduct of adaptive research in a decentralized system has been jointly prepared by MOFA and
CSIR.  The central technical directorates of MOFA would, through their regional and
international contacts in agri-business, ensure that available technologies developed outside Ghana
are made available and those that do not require adaptation or further trials given to the extension
service for diffusion.
Natural Resource Managenent The extension service will promote scaling up of the
successful pilot soil and water conservation programs begun under the Land and Water
Management Project using a community-oriented watershed management approach. This
program will collaborate with the Savanna Resources Management Center established under the
ongoing Natural Resources Management Program, which has a similar program for the savanna
zones in the three northem regions.
Promotion of Farmer Based Organizations (FBOs). Extension services would be made
available to groups of farmers rather than individuals for more cost-effective and rapid diffusion of
technology. Extension agents would be trained on the techniques and dynamics of group
formation by the Departrnent of Cooperatives, the Ghana Cooperative Council and selected
NGOs. It is envisaged that the groups formed by the extension agents would provide the building
blocks for establishing robust FBOs. A memorandum of understanding would be signed between
DOC and MOFA stipulating the details of the nature of their collaboration, including training of
extension staff by DOC on group dynamics, facilitation of group formation, and economic
activities of FBOs, and inclusion of DOC SMSs in SMS centers to work as a team with the
agricultural professional staff. DOC would prepare appropriate training and source material for
extension staff. FBOs formed under this collaborative program would be registered by DOC.
HIVIAIDS Prevention and Control. The technology diffusion component of AgSSIP would
support the efforts of the Ministry of Health (MOH) through the creation of awareness of
HIV/AIDS and its prevention among rural communities. Extension services staff would be trained
by specialists from MOH and work with community health workers to provide basic information
on the subject in rural areas.
Implementawon Arrangements. Under GOG's decentralization program, implementation of
agricultural extension activities is the responsibility of the 110 district assemblies (DAs) in the
country, with the regions providing technical and administrative support. The district agricultural
directorates would be responsible for financial, administrative and technical management of
agricultural development programs. Although MOFA has decided to cede its district staff and
budget to the DAs, integration of the district agricultural directorates into the district assemblies is
yet to materialize. It is awaiting passage of the local government bill by Parliament. Support to
DAs is provided under AgSSIP for operating their extension services in collaboration with FBOs,
- 57 -



NGOs and the private sector.
The regional directorates of agriculture (RDAs) would be assisted by regional development
officers (RDOs) and SMSs to backstop the districts on training extension agents, development of
audio-visual training materials, and conduct of on-farm adaptive trials and demonstrations. In
addition, the RDAs would be equipped and to supervise district agricultural programs to ensure
high performance of the district staff, monitor and evaluate prograns and also provide the linkage
with the national scene. District accountants would be trained in the new accounting system.
The envisaged merger of cocoa and MOFA extension services would require re-orientation
for all the staff in the area of both cocoa and other crops as well as extension methodology. For
this purpose, the program would support in-service training (short courses, study tours and
workshops) and foreign training where no facilities are available in the country. Training will be
given to SMSs, and representatives of FBOs to upgrade their skills, and all staff in management
positions would be trained in management techniques. Additional training will be given on
participatory technology development methods, basic economic and financial analysis, and social
and gender analysis.
The main function of the Directorates at MOFA headquarters would be to provide specialist
support to the regional directorates in: (i) staff training; (ii) staff career development; (iii)
establishing and operating data banks on agricultural technology and results of on-farm research;
(iv) overall extension program coordination, monitoring and evaluation; (v) national and
intemational linkages in technology development and dissemination and; (vi) policy and regulatory
functions. The Directorate of Agricultural Extension would have the primary responsibility for
spearheading the reforms envisaged under this component.
Communications Support. The information Support Unit of MOFA would be strengthened
to produce extension leaflets, posters, audio-visual materials and promote the use of mass media
in a more systematic and appropriate manner. The ISU would work closely with the technical and
regional directorates of MOFA and researchers in developing information materials, using local
languages. The production of some audio visual teaching aids would be contracted out to the
private sector. The distance learning centers established at GIMPA and the University of Ghana
would be used to link up extension staff and leaders of farmers' organizations with their
counterparts in other parts of the world to exchange experiences and share information on new
approaches in technology transfer and diffusion.
Project Component 2 - US$29.46 million
Institutional Reform and Strengthening of MOFA. AgSSEP would support the
restructuring and strengthening of MOFA within the framework of the decentralization policy of
GOG which will fuse govemmental agencies in the regions and districts into single administrative
units. This will integrate resources for implementation of plans and provision of decentralized
services under the administration of district assemblies, thus placing the responsibility for planning
and implementation of agricultural services and development activities at the grassroots level.
The directorates of MOFA at the national level would be responsible for policy formulation,
planning, and coordination, monitoring and evaluation of implementation of development policies
- 58 -



and programs as well as regulatory and information services.
Although this decentralized structure has been put in place, MOFA's implementation capacity
is limited due to partially lack of staff and partially due to inadequate resources. AgSSIP would
build this capacity at MOFA and allied institutions (CSIR and the Department of Cooperatives) to
carry out the decentralization successfully by providing resources at the national, regional and
district levels. The national directorates would be strengthened by developing staff skills to
formulate national policies, implement regional development programs, ensure the delivery of
regulatory services are carried out in accordance with national and international directives and
conventions, provide information, technical backstopping and training services to the regions, and
monitor and evaluate the impact of policies and development programs in their respective
sub-sectors.
MOFA decentralized most of its functions to the regions and districts and appointed
Agricultural Directors both at the regions and districts in 1998. A stumbling block for MOFA to
cede all staff and budget to the regional councils and districts assemblies has been the
non-existence of a local government service scheme. The Local Govemment Service Bill that is
the legislative instrument for creating this scheme has been tabled at Parliament and has been
awaiting passage since 1997. The organization of MOFA has changed drastically under this
decentralization. Its departments at the national level have been re-grouped into four line and
seven technical directorates. Line directorates include, (i) general administration and finance; (ii)
human resource development and management; (iii) policy, planning and monitoring and
evaluation; and (iv) research, statistics, public relations and information. The technical
directorates are: (i) crop services; (ii) plant protection and regulatory services; (iii) animal
production services; (iv) veterinary services; (v) fisheries services; (vi) agricultural engineering
services; and (vii) extension services. In addition, the Irrigation Development Authority, a
subverted agency under the auspices of MOFA is responsible for irrigation development. At the
regional level, Regional directors and their development officers and SMS provide technical
assistance to the district agricultural directors and their staff in planning and implementation of
development policies, programs and regulatory services and monitor implementation progress. At
the district level, the District Director of Agriculture is assisted by district development officers
and agricultural extension agents (AEAs). Regional and district directors have been given
responsibility of technical, financial and administrative management, as well as supervision of the
implementation of all MOFA activities.
It was planned that MOFA would be included in Phase II of the public services reform
program under the National Institutional Renewal Project (NIRP). However, it was brought
forward to Phase I in order to coincide its implementation with Phase I of AgSSIP. Funds will
therefore be made available under AgSSIP for the review of its organization, staffing levels and
management and for implementing the recommendations of the review. This process is expected
start in January 2000 and would take 14 months to complete.
Sub-Component 1. Crop Production and Protection Services: Crop Producfion Services.
The Crop Services Directorate (CSD) will ensure that crop production, processing and
marketing-related activities are adequately represented in the overall policies and development
- 59 -



programs of the public sector. This would be carried out through formulating policies that would
promote the development of the crops industry, sourcing technologies and training SMSs, private
sector operators in agribusiness and NGOs in these technologies, and coordinating the
implementation of crops development programs and regulatory services at the national level.
Under the new decentralized structure, the CSD will need to change the way it is organized to
deliver agricultural services. It is currently focused on the supply side of crop services. i.e.
sourcing production technologies and training SMSs, and promoting of multiplication of
improved seeds and planting materials to the neglect of the demand side. Under AgSSIP, its
mandate and activities will be expanded to deal with the whole continuum of the food chain from
production to distribution on issues related to input supplies, production, on-farm and off-farm
storage, agro-processing and domestic and export marketing.  CSD will appoint senior
commodity officers to be responsible for such a reoriented mandate and the activities it engenders.
Training and technical assistance would be provided and PPMED agricultual economists and
RSID statisticians would assist CSD in expanding its activities to the demand side of crops
services and to ensure that a database on each crop industry is maintained and up to date
production and market information is disseminated to the industry. Logistical support would be
provided for office equipment and vehicles and funds for operations and maintenance. It is
expected that by the end of Phase I, the timeliness and quality of services, reports, workplans and
budgets, and the management of funds will have improved resulting in an improved image of
MOFA in the eyes of the stakeholders in the crops industries as a proactive supporter and
promoter of their initiatives.
Plant Protection and Regulatory Services. The Plant Protection and Regulatory Services
Directorate (PPRSDI is currently inadequately staffed in senior and technical positions and has an
outdated infrastructure and inadequate logistics to cope with the growing demands for its
services. PPRSD would be assisted under AgSSIP to upgrade its capacities in human resources,
information management, policy analysis and advice as well equipped laboratories and other
logistics that would provide adequate basis for sound plant protection policies and regulatory
services. MOFA is keen in the promotion of integrated pest management to reduce dependence
of farmers on synthetic chemical pesticides. PPRSD is the secretariat for the promotion of the
national integrated pest management (IPM) development initiative in which it is collaborating with
the NARS, FAO, IITA and GTZ. It is also active in the implementation of the Pesticide
Management and Control Act of 1998 in collaboration with the EPA. It has 25 officers located in
strategic locations who, in addition to their inspection function, are also training agrochemical
dealers and extension agents on their correct use and adherence to the act. PPRSD staff would be
trained to carry out effectively their functions in plant quarantine, seed certification and pesticide
management. PPRSD would develop a manual for maintaining food quality and safety, collect
and process information on plant protection and regulatory situation nationwide and make it
available to stakeholders through publications and data bank It would also offer expert advice to
stakeholders, and provide technical backstopping and training to SMSs and personnel of
distributors of agrochemical in collaboration with agribusiness.
A special sub-project to control Cocoa Swollen Shoot Virus disease which devastates cocoa
plantations would be implemented with major assistance from the European Union. Cocoa trees
infected with the virus will be destroyed and replaced with hybrid clone seedlings that are resistant
to the disease. Compensation will be paid to owners of the cocoa plants to provide incentive for
- 60 -



the destruction of infected plants and eradication of the disease.
Sub-Component 2. Livestock Services: Animal Production Services. The Animal
Producfion Directorate (APD) needs to reorient its function from one of implementation to that of
providing the policy-setting, advisory and regulatory services for the development of the animal
industries. APD's function would be to ensure that livestock-related activities are represented in
policies and development programs of the public sector. APD would be supported to change its
orientation through training staff and technical assistance. It would be provided with farm
buildings, equipment and machinery, other logistics and operating costs to carry out its reoriented
function effectively. APD and livestock specialists of the university and research organizations
will train SMSs. ADP will be responsible for coordinating the training on livestock related topics
of national importance.
A study will be conducted in the first year of the program to better characterize the
socio-economic profile of livestock farmers in Ghana, and their animal husbandry and
management practices in order to devise appropriate extension packages, especially for the poor,
and to guide livestock research. This information is currently insufficient and will be needed to
provide a more solid underpinning of livestock development activities.
In the area of dairy development, the dairy collection and marketing activities existing around
Accra will be fully transferred to FBOs and APD's dairy cattle breeding farm at Amrahia, would
be scaled down to a self-supporting training facility. Around Year 6 of the AgSSIP, the
dissemination of dairy production and marketing technology would be expected to be fully
integrated in the regular program of SMSs and all other activities privatized.
Improvement of communal grazing land by oversowing leguminous pasture seeds was
successfully carried out under the National Livestock Services Project (NLSP). Livestock
producers have enthusiastically embraced the program and taken the initiative to grow seeds
themselves and oversaw their pasture. This program will be expanded under AgSSIP. A study
will be carried out to assess the degree of access of the poor to improved communal pastures
developed under NLSP; to identify good practice in community-based management of communal
grazing; to assess demand and willingness of livestock producers to pay for seed; and to identify
commercial channels for the sale of seed. This study, along with awareness creation and
demonstrations in a small number of districts, would be funded in the first year of the program.
Further expansion of the over-sown area would be promoted, depending on the successful
identification of sustainable commercial arrangements for seed production and distribution.
The animal-breeding sub-component would emphasize improving local breeds of sheep, goats
and pigs. These breeds are particularly important to poor farmers and women, and, because of the
limited market, and the long-term nature of genetic improvement, there is no direct incentive for
the private sector to take-up this activity. The public sector will continue to be involved since
there is an important need to conserve these breeds, and because the benefits are of multi-regional
and national application, it is important that the six breeding stations of APD at Amrahia, Babile,
Ejura, Kintampo, Nungua and Pong-Tamale and their activities be managed at the national level
by APD rather than de-centralized to the district level, with the District Agricultural Directorate
-61 -



providing veterinary services and participating in the management committees of the stations.
The Open Nucleus Breeding System (NBS), which made little progress under the livestock
project because APD restricted its activities to mainly its own breeding stations, would be
re-launched and the program would seek to expand the selection base for these livestock,
incorporating in the recording system, about 1,000 breeding animals, except in the case of the
Ashanti Forest pig, for which 250 sows would be adequate. The implementation manual details
the scheme for selecting the superior animals from these private flocks. Breeders associations
would be formed to gradually take over the program.
For cattle, the emphasis would be on the conservation of the West African Shorthorn and
during the first year of AgSSIP a study would be carried out on how this preservation can best be
achieved. The existing herd at Pong-Tamale would be maintained, but no specific investments are
foreseen, until the results of this study are available. The key triggers for this component at the
end of the first year would reflect the progress made in expanding the selection system to the
participating farmers, and implementation of the study. During Phase I of AgSSIP, the efficiency
of APD's breeding farms would be improved, and at the end of the third year, the farms would be
expected to be financially independent. Breeders associations would be established starting the
first year, and these organizations would be expected to be fully responsible for the management
of the open-nucleus breeding systems by the end of Phase II of AgSSIP.
Animal Health Services. While the efficiency and effectiveness of the limited number of core
government functions (e.g. disease surveillance and control) would be enhanced, an accelerated
institutional reform process would be implemented in establishing sustainable private-sector-based
animal health delivery systems. Privatization, commercialization, and the development of basic
community-based animal health care services have proven to be efficient, effective and sustainable
in many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Not only do they increase health care access, but also
improve its quality, often at lower net cost to the end-user, thus enabling government resources to
be re-deployed to higher priority public-good functions.
The ongoing privatization of clinical services in urban areas would be expanded under
AgSSIP. A study would be undertaken into the feasibility of delivering all services through
private sector contractors and community-based livestock workers in a pilot district. Strategies
would also be developed for the commercialization or privatization of diagnostic vaccine
production facilities. Existing legislation on veterinary medical practice and privatization of
delivery of animal health services is not conducive for creating an enabling legal environment for
para-professional involvement in animal health service delivery. This legislation would be
reviewed and amended as necessary. The TOR for revising this legislation is given in the
implementation manual.
Cost recovery and commercialization would entail instituting effective financial management
processes, including fiscal measures that ensure revenue is retained within the unit that is
providing the services, allowing for timely payment of contracted services, re-investment and
improvement in the quality of delivery capacity. The livestock revolving fund and the livestock
development fund need to be managed in a transparent and accountable manner to ensure that
they are used for their intended purposes.
- 62 -



Tsetse Control.   Animal Trypanosomiasis is a constraint to integrated small-scale
livestock-crop production systems, as it causes losses in productivity (milk, meat, traction,
manure) and increases the cost of production because of prevention and treatment costs. Tsetse
control might also have negative effects on the environment, as the resulting increased human and
livestock density as well as the overgrazing and crop-encroachment it often entails, might cause
land degradation and loss of bio-diversity. This would be mitigated by the improvement of
grazing lands with the introduction of leguminous plants adapted to the specific ecologies and by
control of grazing. Considerable progress was made under NLSP, in preparing a national map of
the distribution of the tsetse fly population. In addition, community-based control trials were
initiated with non-polluting methods (impregnated screens, traps, individual application of long
duration acaricides) of tsetse control. The results of these pilot trials are very promising.
Following the completion of the survey work in Year 1 of AgSSIP, the emphasis would shift
to these community-based control methods, with the overall objective of establishing and
maintaining manageable tsetse fly levels in already setded areas in an environmentally and socially
sustainable manner, based on active community participation and management. During the first
year, the Tsetse Unit would select two priority areas (with high human, livestock, crop production
and tsetse density) and prepare a tsetse control program, with close community involvement, in
the planning and financing of the operation. Detailed plans for community-based tsetse control in
subsequent years would be prepared and executed, including an environmental impact assessment
of the control activity. To assist the unit in introducing the social dimension of the areas to the
controls, technical assistance would be provided to introduce this dimension as another layer in
the GIS data-base, that the unit has developed under NLSP. Control activities would be
implemented in pilot areas. The medium term objective would be to integrate tsetse control
activities fully in the district plans after sensitizing district assemblies.
As production systems develop ( e.g., small-scale peri-urban dairying) and as new
technologies arrive, the need arises to investigate, develop and validate new disease control
methods, requiring appropriate, socially and economically sound development investment. Two
such priorities have been identified for the early stages of AgSSIP, i.e., the development of a
thermo-stable vaccine against Newcastle Disease (ND), which regularly devastates village chicken
populations that are sometimes the only livestock assets that the rural poor possess. The new (12)
strain of ND antigen that was introduced under NLSP has shown good protection against ND in
Ghana's village poultry population and would be further developed and validated; (ii) The
development peri-urban dairying has brought with it new disease challenges. Heartwater and
dermatophilosis have emerged as significant constraints to small-scale dairying in peri-urban areas,
and funds would be allocated under AgSSIP for developing appropriate control strategies.
In the longer-term, the intensification and commercialization of livestock production, and the
potential demands of zoosanitary measures applied to trade in livestock and livestock products,
would demand increasingly sophisticated diagnostic and investigation acolytes. While not a
priority in the early stages of AgSSIP, a feasibility study would be conducted in Year 3 into the
development of virology diagnostic facilities, for possible funding in Phase II.
AgSSIP would provide training for staff of the Veterinary Services Directorate (VSD) in the
- 63 -



context of their changing roles which will require a focus on the collection and analysis of
epidemiological data, technical backstopping to decentralized services, and the monitoring
demands engendered by contracting-out, commercialization and privatization of delivery of animal
health services. VSD's capacity would be built to respond to emergency and trans-boundary
disease control activities and to implement prioritized national public good disease control
programs (vaccination against epidemic diseases, movement controls, etc.). However, maximum
effort would be made to contract the execution of these programs to private veterinarians. At the
same time, assistance would be given to region and district agricultural services to assess and
prioritize disease constraints of a local public good nature, and to develop effective control
measures.
Livestock Planning and Information Unit (LPIU) was originally established as a dedicated
project support unit for NLSP, and has to date focused, particularly on project monitoring, data
processing and limited studies. However, there remains a need, within PPMED, to maintain
livestock-specific expertise and focus, for policy formulation, planning livestock development
programs, and monitoring and evaluating their impacts. LPIU will therefore be integrated into the
PPMED structure. The socio-economic study of livestock producers mentioned above would be
undertaken by an independent local organization or institution, with PPMED oversight and in
close collaboration with the APD and VSD to provide an essential understanding of the priorities
for AgSSIP in terms of supporting greater access to more relevant services, technologies and
resources as well as provide baseline data on basic livestock ownership patterns and stock and
herd structures.
Sub-Component 3. Management of Fisheries Resources. The most prominent problem in
the fisheries subsector is the decline in the stock of fish, the proliferation of demersal trawling
effort in the near-shore waters all competing for and extracting the dwindling supply of stock, the
absence of an active fisheries resources management regime, weak institutional and legal
frameworks for effectively managing the fisheries resources, and a growing financial crisis in the
industry as the heavy investments by the numerous fishers became unprofitable due to the
declining resource and rising costs.
The IDA supported ongoing Fisheries Sub-Sector Capacity Building Project addresses these
problems by establishing a management regime that would ensure the long-term sustainability of
the fisheries resources. Under the project, the Department of Fisheries (DOF) built capacity for
managing the sub-sector, focusing on policy formulation, management planning and their
implementation; monitoring, control, surveillance (MCS) and enforcement; and promotion of the
development of inland fisheries through staff training, study tours and technical assistance. About
110 community-based fisheries management associations were formed and trained  by a
contracted NGO, many of which are beginning to enforce the existing fisheries regulations
themselves and in collaboration with the MCS Unit. Stock assessment necessary for preparing
management plans, has been conducted. However, estimates of annual catch far exceed the
sustainable limit, resulting in declining quantity and average size of the catch. A fisheries
management plan is under preparation. The envisaged enactment of the revised Fisheries Act has
not been passed due to a constitutional issue that stipulates the Fisheries Commission rather than
the Department of Fisheries is responsible for the management of fisheries resources.
-64 -



Enactment of a revised Fisheries Bill that would create the appropriate legislative framework
for a more rigorous control of over-exploitation of fisheries resources, reconstitution of the
Monitoring, Control and Surveillance Unit (MCS) to include the Ghana Navy and Police; and
establishing an MCS Fund are essential to make progress in fisheries resources management GOG
has given assurances that it would table the bill before Parliament and establish an MCS Fund,
with contributions from the various levies and license fees presently collected by GOG from
actors in the fishing industry to finance MCS operations by October 31, 2000.
In terms of institutional strengthening, The roles and responsibilities of the various
stakeholders (public, private and NGOs) in the fisheries sub-sector would be clearly defined and
support will be provided to bolster their role in the management of fisheries resources. This
sub-component would thus support stock and catch assessment, revision of management plans,
strengthening user group associations, DOF, especially the MCS Unit, community-based fisheries
management associations, district assemblies and the Fisheries Commission.
Stock assessment both in the marine and Lake Volta would be strengthened through the
provision of equipment, logistical support and staff training on condition that the Marine Fisheries
Research Division (MFRD) is transferred to the CSIR. It is proposed that the Fisheries Division
of the Water research Institute be hived off WRI and merged with MFERD to form a new institute
to be called Institute of Fisheries and Oceanographic Research (IFOR). IFOR would, among
others, be responsible for stock assessment of both inland and marine waters and the preparation
of fisheries management plans in collaboration with the DOF. IFOR would be established no later
than 2 months after the effectiveness of the AgSSIP Credit. National fisheries resources
management plans would be reviewed by the newly created Fisheries Management Plans
Operations Committee (FMPOC) after which it would then be forwarded to the Fisheries
Commission (FC). Support would be provided to both the FMPOC and the FC in the
performance of their functions. District assemblies would be empowered to issue licenses, register
and keep records of all fishing vessels operating from landing sites within the district.
Aquaculture development will focus on increasing fish production through private sector
initiative. In general, the constraints to aquaculture development are the initial large investment
required in a situation where long-term credit is expensive and not easily accessible, limited supply
of fingerlings, lack of applied and adaptive research and consequently lack of appropriate
extension messages. Poor business management skills and the high break-even point, making
marketing of pond-raised fish difficult add to the problem. This component would seek to remove
these obstacles by promoting the formation of fish-farmers associations with the objective of
pulling resources together, sourcing and dissemination of technologies and inputs and
strengthening research and extension linkages in aquaculture.
Sub-Component 4.   Agricultural Engineering  Services. Ghana's agriculture is
characterized by very low levels of mechanization. Cutlass, hoe, machete, ax, and forked sticks
are the tools and implements of a vast majority of small scale farmers. Maize is shelled by hand
without using any mechanical device, sorghum millet and rice are threshed by using sticks or
beating them against wood boards. Women lift water for irrigation from shallow tube wells with
a roped pale. The crop harvest obtained after hard toil is subject to considerable post harvest loss
- 65 -



due to inefficient storage structures and high moisture content in the case of cereal and
leguminous crops. The introduction and widespread use of intermediate technology tools and
implements that reduce the drudgery of farm work, particularly for women who have household
chores apart from farm work, is essential if small scale Ghanaian agriculture is to be intensified
through improved farm labor productivity.
A study under the National Agricultural Extension Project reported that in some areas,
particularly northern Ghana, the use of animal drawn implements (ploughs, weeders, carts etc) is
increasing and that intermediate technology equipment is also being used by small-scale
agro-processors, e.g. milling, palm oil extraction and gain making. Such equipment is being
locally fabricated (graters, threshers grinders, oil extruders etc.). However, it identified the supply
side constraints as: (i) limited knowledge of local blacksmiths/artisans who manufacture some of
these equipment in basic manufacturing processes like hardening, tempering, material selection
and in appropriate alternative working equipment e.g. raised hearths, bellows etc. that can
enhance the productivity their workshop; (ii) lack of entrepreneurial skill to enable these
manufacturers manage their business efficiently; and (iii) lack of access to finance. The
consolidation and development of this local manufacture of primary farm tools and equipment is
therefore an important step in improving their quality and efficiency, decreasing their unit cost and
increasing their widespread use.
On the demand side, constraints to farmers adopting intermediate technology include: (i) poor
access to information on existing technologies; (ii) lack of an effective methodology for
dissemination of appropriate technologies; and (iii) lack of credit for farmers, processors and
traders to purchase intermediate technology equipment. To overcome these constraints, the
Agricultural Engineering Services Directorate (DAES) will establish a rural technology
information unit to make appropriate technology information readily available and disseminate
them through the mass media. It will also arrange training for local manufacturers, artisans and
blacksmiths on improving their skills and products.
Sub-Component 5. Agricultural Statistics Services. MOFA's present system of sampling,
data collection, quality control, analysis and dissemination of agricultural statistics in MOFA is
inadequate and unreliable. Data collection, e.g., for the Annual Sample Survey of Agriculture
(ASSA) to estimate total production and land cultivated for only six key crops, i.e. cassava, yam,
plantain, maize, cowpea and sorghum, is compiled manually, with only summary data prepared for
analysis. The last Agricultural Sample Survey Census was caned out in 1970. Another census
was attempted in 1984 which was successful, but provided only a limited range of data. The
profile on the structure of the agricultural sector is obsolete. The sampling procedures and quality
control for the ASSA have progressively deteriorated to the state where the reliability of the
current data produced is widely questioned and falls far short of meeting the priority data
requirements. Field staff are poorly equipped and lack motivation. Shortage of operational funds
limits the work, including adequate supervision and quality control.
The Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) has a large statistical program, producing a wide range
of data, much of which is directly or indirectly related to the agricultural sector, notably, external
trade and household statistics, using the Ghana living standards surveys. GSS has conducted a
population census in March, 2000. However, GSS relies on MOFA for much of the agricultural
- 66 -



sector data and is keen to see a well developed and reliable food and agriculture statistical
Services (FASS). The purpose of establishing FASS is to provide an improved flow of reliable
and timely statistical information on agriculture and fisheries through the establishment of an
operational food and agriculture statistics system for: (i) supporting policy formulation and
decisionmaking processes; (ii) planning and implementing agricultural development programs; (iii)
monitoring and evaluating the impact of policies and development programs; Qiv) estimating the
contribution of the agriculture sector to GDP; and (v) assessing its performance over time.
The newly established Statistics, Research and Information Department (SRID) will develop
an agricultural surveys and reporting system that includes a Multi-round Annual Commodities
Survey Program (MRACSP), and an agricultural sector structural survey. The MRACSP would
provide a single survey program for all data collection activities related to: (i) agricultural
commodities production and status; Cii) supply and utilization of agricultural inputs; (iii) farm
management data; and (iv) data for impact evaluation of agricultural development policies and
programs. A two-stage sampling design would be used to provide reliable estimate at the district
level. In a separate exercise, large scale and specialized holdings would be covered on a complete
count basis annually. The statistical data would be geo-referenced to form an integral part of the
geographic information system (GIS) for the agriculture sector. The existing monthly crop
monitoring and reporting system would be revised to provide quantitative as well as qualitative
information and would be integrated into the MRACSP to ensure the monitoring elements are
continuous. The necessary technical support would be provided through consultancies and
training.
Agricultural extension agents would be the primary data collectors with the assistance and
supervision of staff of the District Information Systems and Database Unit. These staff in turn
would be supervised by SMSs who would control for the quality of the data being collected at
the ground level. RSID would provide overall direction, training and technical backstopping and
the regional offices would provide coordinating support at the regional level. Data processing
would be decentralized to the Regional Offices, SMS Centers and Districts to the extent possible.
A comprehensive agricultural sector survey (ASS) would be undertaken as a matter of priority
within the FAO's program for the World Census of agriculture 2000. The objective is to provide
up to date information on the basic profile of the agricultural sector to capture structural changes
that occur over the medium and long term. Maximum advantage would be taken of modern data
processing techniques. Data capture would be at regional and sub-regional levels, as appropriate.
The resultant database would be widely disseminated and staff in the districts and regions would
be trained in accessing and using the data for planning purposes.
A nationalfood and agricultural statistics database would be designed, field tested and made
operational. Data processing capacity would be strengthened through provision of equipment,
training and introduction of basic data processing systems. A PC-based local area network (LAN)
would be set up in RSID HQ. MOFA is establishing intranet connectivity between its
headquarters directorates and the regional offices. This would provide a rapid data transmission
facility. Access to the internet would also be provided. Many SMS Centers and District RSIPD
would be equipped with computers to facilitate data capture, dissemination and analysis.

Data analysis and special studies. In order to promote a 'user-driven' approach to the
development of FASS, in-depth data analysis and special studies would be conducted to enhance
the usefulness of the available data and to identify weaknesses and gaps. These would focus on
the preparation of commodity supply/utilization accounts and food balance sheets, economic
accounts for agriculture and the development of a national food insecurity and vulnerability
information and mapping system (FIVIMS). A number of other analytical studies identified by
other directorates of MOFA, particularly PPMED, would also be undertaken upon request. It
would not be possible for staff of RSPID to analyze all of the statistical data compiled due to the
limited number of qualified staff, nor would it be desirable to increase its staff strength to achieve
this purpose. It would, therefore, contract out significant amount of analysis work to institutions
like the Institute of Statistics, Social and Economic Research (ISSER) and the departments of
Agricultural Economics of the four national universities. MOFA has given assurances that a
memorandum of understanding with at least one of these institutions would be signed by
September 30, 2000.
A suitable National Early Warning and Food Information System (EWFIS) would be
developed, using analysis of a combination of data sources such as agro-meteorology, remote
sensing, agricultural statistics, monitoring of status of agricultural production and socio-economic
indicators, including food stock and relief management. This would trigger actions by MOFA to
better prepare for coping with natural calamities.
Strengthening Market Information and Intelligence Services.  Accelerated agricultural
growth which is mainly based on private and export-led expansion requires information both on
prices of inputs and commodities in domestic market and export markets. An agricultural market
information services would be developed to provide comprehensive and timely price information
on the domestic and international scene to producers, traders and exporters.
Sub-Component 6. Agricultural Policy, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Services.
The Policy, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Directorate (PPMED) is responsible for
agricultural policy forrnulation, program planning and budgeting, and monitoring and impact
evaluation of agricultural development policy and programs in the country. To date PPMED has
not been able to canyout these important functions effectively due to shortage of qualified staff.
The International Relations Division of PPMED is involved only in procurement and disbursement
services for some of the donor supported programs. It does not have any functional working
relationship with the rest of the PPMED divisions. Similarly, the agricultural economists
seconded to the various MOFA projects, although very active in monitoring and evaluation
activities at the project level, do not seem to have functional links with PPMED. With the
decentralization of MOFA's services, policy makers at the center and their development partners
would need real-time feedback on the effect of policy decisions and the progress and impacts of
agricultural development programs executed at the district and regional levels. This was an
important consideration leading to the decision that the overall coordination of AgSSIP should
reside within PPMED. This places a heavy responsibility on PPMED, the strengthening of which
becomes paramount. PPMED will therefore be restructured and strengthened under AgSSIP so
that it would execute effectively its important role in MOFA. While existing staff would receive
in-service training in policy analysis, program planning, monitoring and evaluation, it is realized
- 68 -



the current staff strength would not be able to carry this heavy responsibility without the
recruitment of additional staff and technical assistance in the form of short and long-tefm
consultants and contracting out some of the work to the economic think tanks in the country such
as ISSER, Center for Economic Policy Analysis (CEPA), the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA)
and the faculties of Agricultural Economics of the four national unijersities. Graduate students in
the local universities would be encouraged to use agricultural policy and impact evaluation
research for their M.Sc. and Ph.D. thesis by funding their field wor analysis of data and writing
up the results.
Monitoring and Evaluation Under AgSSIP. PPMED will operate and maintain a practical
and effective M&E system for MOFA that will ensure the capture, analysis and flow of
information needed for tracking and assessing performance and evaluating impact of policy and
development interventions, as decision-making tools for program planners and managers as well
as for policy makers. The M&E system consists of performance monitoring, beneficiary
assessment, and impact evaluation. An important feature of the M&E system is that all
data/information from focal program implementation units will be integrated to ensure effective
data/information flow and exchange. The system will also ensure disaggregation by gender,
where relevant, to shed light on phenomena and trends on gender issues.
Performance monitoring will be conducted on AgSSIP programs, other MOFA programs and
the agriculture sector. Performance monitoring is intended to track progress of activities and
assess compare them with planned targets, including financial and physical inputs, outputs,
timeliness and efficiency of delivery of services. Information gathered and analyzed by AgSSIP
implementation agencies themselves, using formats agreed upon with PPMED, will be utilized as
decision making tool at program level to identify gaps and constraints for corrective actions while
at the sector level, information will be used for policy making.
Performance monitoring will be implemented at the district, regional and national levels, using
key indicators and formats agreed upon with the PPMED. District Directorates of Agriculture
(DDAs) will maintain basic agricultural data that would be needed for program and sector
monitoring. They will perform analysis of the data for assessing and informing their own planning
and programs. They will submit their monitoring reports to their district assemblies and forward
the data and their analysis reports to the Regional Directorates of Agriculture (RDAs)
semiannually, supplemented with two interim quarterly monitoring sheets that simply show
achievements versus targets with brief explanation for deviations and major problems encountered
and/or expected. The RDAs would compile and analyze district data and information to form a
regional picture and submit their reports to PPMED semiannually with two interim quarterly
supplements, with a copy to all their respective DDAs. Monitoring at the regional level would
provide monitoring information for the region's own performance monitoring and planning as well
as to provide regional perspective to sector monitoring. PPMED would compile and analyze the
regional data to form a national picture and to provide on the overall performance of development
programs and the agricultural sector. The quarterly and semi-annual reports of PPMED would
be distributed to the RDAs, DDAs, all program implementing agencies, senior management of
MOFA, the Ministry of Finance and the donors.
-69-



The CSIR is using the INFORM management and infonnation system designed by the
International Service for National Agricultural Research (ISNAR) and adapted for the Ghanaian
NARS. Both research program monitoring and financial and procurement reports would be
submitted to PPMED for inclusion in the total monitoring report for AgSSIP. Similarly, the
Department of Cooperatives, the Ghana Cooperative Council and other NGOs and FBO's
contracted to provide services or are beneficiaries under the FBO development grant would
submit their quarterly and semiannual reports to PPMED. All program implementation agencies
receiving funds under AgSSIP, including DDAs and RDAs, have to submit full financial reports in
accordance with a format issued by the Financial Controller of MOFA.
Beneficiary assessments will be carried-out from time to time, in collaboration with civil
society and the private sector, to gauge the satisfaction of beneficiaries on services they receive
and the efficiency of delivery of services including extension services, progress of privatization of
extension services and support to FBOs. Impact evaluations will be conducted to determine the
extent to which the program and sector development objectives have been achieved. Impact
evaluation studies will be conducted periodically. As mentioned earlier, given inadequate capacity
of PPMED in terms of staffing and analytical skills beneficiary assessment and impact evaluation
work would be contracted out.
Project Component 3 - USS 9.93 million
Promotion of Farmer-Based Organizations. Smallscale farmers face diseconomies of scale
in accessing input supply, credit and markets for their output. Because getting farmers organized
tackles this problem as well as empowers them to bargain in the market and socio-political arena,
where decisions affecting their welfare are taken, support would be provided under AgSSIP to
creating enabling conditions for the development of farmer-based organizations (FBOs). The
main objective of the subprogram is to develop a grassroots independent movement of FBOs that
is led and run by the farmers themselves. AgSSIP would support the deepening and completion
of policy, institutional and legislative reforms that would facilitate the development of FBOs, and
putting in place prograns that would assist them to be market-oriented and farner-led. The key
elements that would enable such development are: strengthened institutions that cater for the
training needs of FBO staff, well-organized field training and education of members and trustees
of farmer-based organizations; and the availability of adequate promotional and advisory services
provided mostly by their apex organizations and to a much lesser extent, the govemment.
The FBO subprogram has five components, comprising: (i) development of policies and legal
framework conducive for creation of farmer-led organizations and NGOs; (ii) promotion and
development of grass-root level FBOs; (iii) strengthening the capacity of agencies responsible for
assisting the promotion and development of FBOs; (iv) upgrading the Cooperative College and
transforming it into a College of Farmer-Based Organizations; and (v) establishment of an FBO
Development Fund.

Policy and Regulatory Framework The Cooperatives Policy document would be completed
and the Cooperatives Decree of 1968 revised in order to establish a sound foundation for the
development of an autonomous, independent and sustainable cooperative and FBO movements in
Ghana. NGOs are involved in promoting FBOs and participating in the socio-economic
development of the country. An appropriate policy framework and legislation needs to be put in
place for guiding the formation and operation of NGOs and for regulating their activities in
Ghana. The 1968 Co-operative Societies Decree is obsolete. It is necessary to establish
cooperative legislation that is congruent with the broad government policies of a market
economy, and participatory, bottom-up approach to development that would ensure autonomy of
the cooperative movement from interference from government and politicians. A draft for the
revision of this act has been prepared. However, the inclusion of provisions of legislation for
non-cooperative FBOs needs to be considered. Support would be given under AgSSIP to
complete the revision of the draft law and to conduct a publicity campaign on the drafts of the
policy and law in order to inform and educate the cooperators and the public about the
forthcoming revised law and initiate a public debate. Passing of a revised FBO law would be a
trigger for initiating this component in Phase II of AgSSIP.
In 1995, the government attempted to introduce a law to regulate the activities of NGOs.
However, the draft was not well received by the NGO community because they felt the bill
allowed excessive government control, infringing upon their rights as civic organizations. The
government withdrew the proposed bill and is considering a draft policy paper for NGO
operations. Recognizing that NGOs can play a more effective catalytic role than government
agencies in the promotion and development of FBOs, support would be provided under AgSSIP
to finalize the NGO legislation.
Strengthening Capacity of Agencies Promoting FBOs. The Department of Cooperatives (DOC) of
the Ministry of Employment and Social Welfare (MESW) derives its powers from  the
Cooperative Societies Decree of 1968 [Details on DOC, including objectives, organization, staffing, and
activities, see Department of Cooperatives: "Project Proposal for Formation and Strengthening of
Agricultural Associations," (December 1998), or The Finnish Cooperative Development Center: "Assistance
to the Department of Cooperatives and Directorate of Extension Services to Prepare a Program for
Promoting the Development of Farmer-based Organizations in Ghana in the Context of AgSSlP" (August
1999)]. It is responsible for the promotion of cooperatives and performs both statutory and
non-statutory functions. The statutory functions include registration, auditlinspection, and
settlement of disputes. Its non-statutory functions include counseling the public and cooperatives
on cooperative matters as well as training and education of cooperative members and their
executive committees, and capacity building through on-the-job training of managers and other
employees of cooperative societies. DOC has offices in all the ten regional capitals and the 110
districts of the country. At the beginning of 1999, there were 402 staff, against an establishment
of 434 positions. The professional staff numbered 283. On average, two professional-level staff
serves each district, where there are 5 to 20 cooperatives and numerous farmer groups being
nurtured to become cooperatives. However, the staff are constrained by lack of operating funds
and mobility to carry out their functions effectively. Funds would be provided under AgSSIP to
facilitate the mobility and operations of regional and district staff in carrying out their functions.
While DOC would continue to be charged with statutory functions such as registration and
inspection, it would devolve the functions of audit and settlement of disputes to the Ghana
- 71 -



Cooperative Council (GCC) as the latter is strengthened and becomes capable of assuming these
functions. To this end, DOC would spearhead the preparation and completion of the cooperative
policy document and revision of the regulatory framework in collaboration with GCC. The new
focus of promoting and regulating cooperatives as business entities, would require a change of
attitude and new professional competence on DOC staff. These requirements would be addressed
through training and employment of staff with the right qualifications in the areas of business and
financial management.
The NGO Unit in MESW suffers from inadequate resources and is unable to carry out its
statutory functions regarding NGOs. Records are kept in loose files and a proper NGO Directory
is unavailable. The objective of this sub-component is to strengthen the capability of MESW to
formulate policies for the registration and operation of NGOs and carry out effectively its
regulatory functions for NGOs. A reliable data base would be established on NGOs and their
operations that would be available to the public. Funds would be provided under AgSSIP to: (i)
establish and operate a computerized database on NGOs and their activities and to publish this
information periodically; (ii) train MESW staff on NGO objectives and their activities and on
Ghana's NGO policies and regulations; and (iv) commission research and studies on the impact
and effectiveness of NGOs operating in Ghana.
Promotion of the Development of Farmer-Based Organizations (FBOs).   Strengthening the
Cooperatives Apex Body. The apex body for all types of cooperatives is the GCC to which 11
national associations are affiliated. It represents the cooperative movement at all intemational
levels and foster international cooperation through its membership of the Intemational
Cooperative Alliance (ICA) and other intemational bodies. The GCC has an executive board and
offices in all of the 10 regions. It has been rendered weak by the decline of the cooperative
movement. GCC is reliant on government and donor financial support and hence government
influence in carrying out its activities. A study would be conducted to determine whether the GCC
should serve as the apex organization for all FBOs or setting-up a non-cooperative FBOs apex
organization would be a better option. GCC would be strengthened under AgSSIP through staff
training and provision of logistics to carry out its mandate effectively. The Council would set up
an audit unit to takeover auditing of co-operatives from the Department of Cooperatives. The
audit unit would charge fees for its service to be financially sustainable in the long run and capable
of handling auditing of all registered co-operatives in Ghana. However, during Phase I of
AgSSIP it would cover only cooperatives in 10 districts in two selected regions. GCC has
conducted a feasibility study, including a business plan and strategies for marketing of the audit
services, staffing levels for the unit and terms of reference for the auditors. The study shows that
the audit activity can become self-sustaining after three years. GCC would also prepare a plan for
the reduction of its financial dependency on the Government, with support from the International
Labor Organizations (ILO).
Education and Training for Farmer-Based Organizations. Education and training are vital activities
in developing sound FBOs that are based on active participation of the beneficiaries in their own
development [The term "education" is used in this context to refer to basic knowledge provided to
cooperative and other producer-group members and committees on principles, benefits, rights and
- 72-



obligations or working together in an organized form. "Training" refers to more occupational or vocational
form of education given to employees of cooperatives, staff of the Department of Cooperatives, or key
committee members to facilitate them nrnning their organizations more effectively].  There is no
systematically organized field education program for members of FBOs and their executive
committees. Adequate understanding of the economic functions and operations, as well as of the
social responsibilities that working in groups entails for members and their executive committee is
of critical importance for FBOs to succeed. GCC in collaboration with NGOs would start an
education program with initial support under AgSSIP. A national FBOs education and training
plan would be prepared, in collaboration with other stakeholders and initiated in two selected
regions. It would be upscale to other regions, incorporating the lessons learnt from the
experience in the two regions. A consultant with an extensive experience in planning and
execution of such programs would be engaged to assist in its preparation.
Strengthening of College for Farmer-Based Organizations. The only institution providing
formal training on cooperatives and activities of economic groups is the Ghana Cooperative
College in Kumasi that was established by DOC and GCC in 1971 with British Government
support. It is an autonomous agency under the MESW and is managed by a nine member board,
representing four ministries, a national university and the GCC. The college has three tutors in
addition to the principal, two of whom have BA. degrees. It offers only one certificate course of
three months in 6 subjects for primary society secretaries. It has trained about 6,000 people, of
whom 51 percent are from the cooperative movement, 18 percent from DCO, and the rest from
the general public. It is planning to start a Diploma course with higher entry qualifications in the
year 2000. The objective is to equip society secretaries/managers with adequate skills to manage
cooperatives as businesses in Ghana's liberalized environment. Further plans include in-service
training for the staff of DOC and short courses for cooperators.
Under AgSSIP, the present role of the Cooperative College would be enlarged to include
other formalized training for group-based organizations besides cooperatives. A strategic plan for
complementary institutional arrangements and improving the college's sustainability, would be
prepared, with ILO support. The plan would take into account the training provided by NGOs
for FBOs, including cooperatives. Support would be given to engage consultants to draft a
strategic plan for the development of the college into an autonomous and sustainable private
sector training institute for cooperatives and FBOs with the stakeholders, including GOG as
owners. An essential element of the strategic plan would be a program to: (i) reduce GOG's
share of financing the College; (ii) reformulate the college curricula and include in it a substantial
amount of business studies, to design training arrangements, specify teacher qualifications and
equipment requirements, and participate in training of the teachers; (iii) organize study visits for
staff of the College, its Board and GCC and DOC to African countries where cooperative colleges
and decentralized field training have been well organized and run; (iv) provide logistics, training
equipment and materials for upgrading the training; and (v) allow a limited expansion of the
physical structure of the College warranted by the restructuring plan for the college.
Exposure to External Experiences. Ghanaian cooperators and policy makers have been
isolated from the international cooperative community for many years, since the movernent started
to loose its importance in society. [All Ghanaian national-level cooperative organizations, even the apex
organization, the Ghana Cooperative Council, lost their membership in the Intenational Cooperative Alliance
- 73-



because of unpaid dues. GCC regained the ICA membership recently through a contribution from the
Government] The key areas where participants and policy makers would benefit from an exposure
to external experiences and lessons include: (i) cooperative legislation and development, (ii)
cost-effective cooperative education and training; (iii) marketing systems; (iv) agricultural
extension methodology; (v) micro-finance institutions in developing countries and participation in
international micro-finance training.
Mainstreaming of Gender in Development of FBOs. The general objective is to promote
actions needed to close the recognized gender gap particularly in rural areas, and, in general, to
mainstream gender in the FBOs development programs. There is a basic understanding of the
meaning of the gender gap in Ghana and that the gap is widespread. Measures are under way to
narrow that gap on several fronts. A draft National Gender Policy has been prepared by MOFA
but is yet to be adopted by GOG. There is a Directorate for Women in Agricultural Development
(WIAD) in MOFA whose major tasks include training and enhancement of food processing,
nutrition, and domestic management. In the context of AgSSIP, WIAD has prepared a plan to
tackle gender issues. In addition, MOFA has established a Gender Desk to mainstream gender in
agricultural extension services.
DOC also has an officer in charge of Women in Development at its headquarters and at each
Regional office. There are 35 women cooperatives and about a third of all cooperative members
are women. DOC and GCC would ensure that: (i) gender issues relating to the development of
FBOs are adequately represented in the processing of the Draft National Gender Policy and
getting it debated by gender advocacy organizations and the public; (ii) the Cooperatives and
NGO policies and proposed laws are scrutinized for their gender sensitivity; (iii) specific aspects
relating to gender issues in cooperatives and other FBOs would be recorded and incorporated in
the gender training program proposed by MOFA; and (iv) a study on the implementation of
gender policies in the FBO sector would be contracted out to a local university. Desegregation of
gender would be included in all studies and analysis and in the course of regular monitoring and
evaluation process of FBO and NGO activities.
Establishment of Farmer-Based Organizations Development Fund. Farmer-Based Organizations
Development Fund (Fund) would be established under AgSSIP to spur the development of FBOs,
including agricultural cooperatives by rekindling their development that was halted two decades
ago by excessive govemment intervention in their operations. The Fund would provide matching
grants for small subprojects such as: (i) innovative proposals for economic activities of FBOs
through participatory approaches; (ii) rehabilitation of old facilities; (iii) vertical integration of
FBOs and development of services for FBO needs at the grass-root level; and (iv) upgrading the
human capacity in FBOs that is not covered under the GCC or Departnent of Cooperatives
training programs.
The FBO Fund would be administered by a Board of Trustees. A draft manual for the
management of the FBO Fund, acceptable to donors, elaborating; (i) the terms of reference and
composition of the Board of Trustees; (ii) the criteria for eligibility of applicants and for award of
matching grants; (iii) the procedures for funds withdrawal from the Fund's account in a
commercial bank and disbursement to awardees; and (iv) the monitoring and evaluation of
awardees' performance would be prepared by July 31, 2000 and the Board of Trustees
- 74-



inaugurated by September 30, 2000. An NGO would be selected through competitive bidding to
serve as the secretariat for the Board, processing funding proposals for its decision in accordance
with the manual mentioned above, executing the Board's decisions and monitoring awardees on
their performance. A study would be conducted under the auspices of the selected NGO on the
characteristics and performance of farmer-based organizations in Ghana to draw lessons from
their experience and best practice in the world to prepare a plan of action for further development
of FBOs in Ghana.
The starting capital for the Fund, US$5.0 million equivalent, would be provided under
AgSSIP, but additional resources would be solicited from the FBO movements themselves and
other donors, once the Fund's operations are well advanced. Selection of subprojects for financing
under the Fund would be demand-driven and the size of the grants would depend on the actual
needs of the FBOs. The opportunities in this respect and the rules of the Fund would be
publicized among potential beneficiaries by the staff of GCC and the Cooperative Departnent
through a process of participatory discussions. The subproject to be assisted have to meet the
eligibility criteria set below for the participating regions and subprojects [while this draft suggest the
criteria to be used and the type of subprojects for which Fund assistance would be made available, they
should be elaborated on the basis of a review by the relevant stakeholders at a workshop].
Eligibility Criteria. In approving subprojects for Fund financing, the Regional subcommittee
of COC for FBOs would consider the following criteria: (i) potential replication effect after the
pilot phase; (ii) suitable size of the project to be supported (not more than US$ 20,000 equivalent)
and a satisfactory degree of certainty that the project objectives can be achieved with the funds
available; (ii) adequate spread within the region; (iii) a minimum contribution of 20 percent by the
FBO; (iii) availability of competent staff; and (iv) and level of outreach (number of members
involved).
Typical subproject examples would be:
*  Training programs for committee members and staff (when not organized free of charge by
(GCC or the Cooperative Department);
_  Technical training for staff in specialized societies (such as storing technology, fish processing
technology, etc.) and well-defined study tours in Ghana;
*  hnprovement of the members' capacity to understand and develop their professional
organizations through literacy and numeracy programs and training in group dynamism;
*  Institution building by activities aimed at strengthening vertical integration and services
needed to create confidence and demand among member agencies;
*  Technology and logistical support for grass-root-level FBOs when they can be used for
demonstration purposes or are of innovative nature (examples: renovations of farm input
stores; fruit drying and packaging facilities; small mills for different types of produce;
hydraulic processing units for sunflower and other oil seeds; cold stores for potatoes; cooling
facilities for milk collection centers, etc.);
*  Marketing campaigns for new products;
*  Accounting, safekeeping, and communications equipment for newly starting or rehabilitated
FBOs, and related software and training;
*  Other FBO needs that meet the eligibility criteria; and
- 75 -



*  Consultant assistance for formulating the above subprojects.
Implementation of subprojects would be the responsibility of the FBOs awarded matching
grants, if necessary, with the help of NGOs, or consultants. Whenever possible, the actual
implementation of the subprojects would be contracted out by the FBO to a suitable NGO or
consultants.
Procurement, disbursement of funds, supervision, accounting and audit. Procurement and
disbursement under the Fund would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines for Simplified Procurement and Disbursement for Community-based Investments
(March 1988)". IDA and other donors would release funds for new subprojects according to the
procedures defined in the Guidelines, the applications of which would be elaborated in the Fund
manual mentioned above. The PCD of MOFA will responsible for supervising adherence to the
Guidelines by the Board of Trustees and the selected NGO to administer the funds in
collaboration with GCC and the Department of Cooperatives. The Fund would be audited by
external auditors acceptable to IDA.
Project Component 4 - US$5.67 million
Strengthening Agricultural Education and Training. The University of Ghana, Cape
Coast University and Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology have discontinued
their diploma programs in agriculture. Middle level agricultural technicians are trained only at the
certificate level in six agricultural colleges under the management of MOFA. These are: (i)
Pong-Tamale Animal Health and Production College in the Northern Region; (ii) Damango
Agricultural College in the Northern Region; (iii) Ejura Agricultural Mechanical College in
Ashanti Region; (iv) Kwadaso Agricultural College in Ashanti Region; (v) Ohawu Agricultural
College in Volta Region; and Kpong Irrigation College in Eastern Region. These colleges run
three-year certificate programs, graduating collectively about 200 students a year. In addition,
MOFA also operates three farm institutes that offer short residential vocational courses for
commercially oriented farmers on farming technology. These are located at Wenchi in
Brong-Ahafo Region, Asuansi in Central Region and Adidome in Volta Region.
The major constraints that the colleges and farm institutes face are inadequate infrastructure,
equipment, shortage of funds for operating costs and limited opportunity to upgrade skills of
teaching staff. Many of the buildings require repair additional dornitories are needed to increase
the enrollment of female students. Moreover, the agricultural colleges were established to train
manpower for employment in the public sector, mainly MOFA and the agricultural research
institutes. Employment in the public sector is getting restricted while opportunities are opening
up in the private sector with the expansion of commercial agriculture. Private sector demand will
increase as the envisaged privatization of agricultural services gains momentum and individuals,
FBOs and NGOs organize to deliver these services. These would require overhauling the
curriculum of the agricultural colleges to reorient them in meeting the skilled manpower demands
of the private sector.
The objective of this component is to strengthen the capacity of agricultural training colleges
and farm institutes to produce the middle level human resources/skills critically needed for the
- 76 -



sustained development of the agriculture sector. This objective will be achieved through: (i) an
in-depth review of Ghana's agricultural education strategy and the revision of the curricula of the
colleges and the institutes to cater to the skill needs of the private sector; (ii) the inclusion of the
private sector, FBOs and NGOs on the boards of the colleges to make them responsive to the
demands of the private sector and to obtain its support; (iii) the recruitment of new teaching staff
and upgrading dkills of existing teaching staff to meet the training demands of the private sector,
and (iv) rehabilitation of the infrastructure, transport and equipment of the colleges and institutes.
Finally, the Human Resources Development Directorate (IRDD), responsible for the oversight of
the agricultural colleges and farm institutes as well as for planning and implementing training
programs for the career development of all MOFA staff, will be strengthened through the
provision of training, transport, office equipment and operating costs.
A new curriculum for diploma level courses would be instituted at the Kwadaso Agricultural
College with a capacity of graduating 50 students a year. The curricula of the remaining five
colleges would be revised to cater to the skill demands of the private sector. A skill demand study
would be conducted during the first year of AgSSIP to inform the design of the revised curricula.
MOFA has entered into agreement with the University of Cape Coast to offer a B. Sc. program in
Agricultural Extension, mainly aimed at opening an opportunity for career advancement of
experienced and meritorious agricultural extension personnel in the national agricultural extension
system. AgSSIP would also support the provision of text and reference books, visual aids, and
equipment to this program.
The Human Resources Development Directorate (HRDD) is responsible for the oversight of
the agricultural colleges and farm institutes as well as planning and implementing training
programs for the career development of all MOFA staff. HRDD would be strengthened through
the provision of training, transport, office equipment and operating costs
AgSSIP Implementation Arrangements. Three sector ministries (Ministries of Food and
Agriculture; Environment, Science & Technology; and Employment & Social Welfare),
farmer-based organizations, NGOs, the private sector would be involved in the implementation of
AgSSIP. However, MOFA would be the lead agency coordinating its overall implementation by
providing financial control, procurement, monitoring, evaluation and reporting services. The
overall organization and management structure for implementation of AgSSIP would be
consistent with the Government's decentralized local government and rural development system
which has started to devolve power and responsibility of central government to the 10 regional
councils and 110 district assemblies. AgSSIP would be implemented by existing institutions, thus
avoiding costly creation of new program implementation units that are manned by contract staff
and collapse with the end of donor financing. Existing agencies and directorates of MDAs would
be responsible for implementation of the various components of AgSSIP as shown in Table 1.

The Director of PPMED of MOFA  will be the National Coordinator for AgSSIP who will be
assisted by a Deputy Director, who will be explicitly responsible for the administrative
management of Project. PPMED would be restructured and staffed appropriately to carry out
these functions effectively. All accounting and financial functions would be transferred from the
current Administration and Finance Directorate, and all procurement, disbursement and
accounting functions of the current Project Coordination Unit of MOFA transferred to the
Program Coordination Division (PCD). MOFA would arrange with the Controller's and
Accountant General's Office for the secondment of a chartered and experienced accountant as
Financial Controller of MOFA under similar terms and conditions for the Financial Controller of
the Health Sector Investment Project. At the regional and district levels, the regional and district
agricultural directors would assume the function of, respectively the regional and district AgSSIP
coordinators.
Procurement and Financial Management Responsibility. National coordination and
management of procurement, finance as well as program-wide monitoring and evaluation and
reporting functions for AgSSIP would reside in the PPMED of MOFA. However, PCD will be in
charge of procurement for all the non-research components of AgSSIP and the CSIR for the
research component. Both PCD and CSIR have procurement and finance proficient staff. The
CSIR has a satisfactory computerized accounting and control system. A consultant is modifying
the MOFA computerized accounting and control system to ensure it will meet the requirements of
consolidated accounting, reporting and control systems under AgSSIP. The PCD will receive
periodic reports from CSIR to enable consolidation and presentation of the needed reports to the
AgSSIP National Steering Committee and donors. The audit of AgSSIP accounts will be
conducted annually and carried out by independent and qualified auditors under competitive
bidding and acceptable to IDA.
PCD and the CSIR will be responsible for procurement under ICB and packages for vehicles,
computer systems and major contracts for equipment, works and consultant service.  In
accordance with the overall procurement plans, PCD and CSIR will delegate to the
implementation units procurement of items locally available in the districts, minor construction,
small contracts for miscellaneous items of supplies, services and training and all items under
operating costs. PCD and CSIR will have oversight responsibility for ensuring the implementing
- 78 -



units plan procurement and process contracts in a timely and orderly manner, following correct
procurement procedures. The Department of Cooperatives  will be responsible only for
monitoring and guiding the implementation of the subprojects under the FBO Development Fund,
ensuring participation of representatives of FBOs in preparation and appraisal of subprojects,
processing and award of contracts, supervision and certification of completed contracts. Use of
NGOs for procurement processing and service delivery will be encouraged at all levels.
Program Coordinating Committees. An AgSSIP National Advisory Committee (NAC)
would be set up to provide policy guidance and oversight to the National AgSSIP Coordinator
and the implementing agencies. It would be chaired by the Minister of MOFA (or his/her
designee) and would include representatives of: (i) the private sector (farmers, input traders,
commodity traders, processors and exporters); (ii) NGOs; (iii) women's organizations; and (iv)
Ministries of (a) local Government and Rural Development; (b) Science, Environment and
Technology; (c) Trade and Industry; (d) Roads and Transport; and (e) Finance. The director of
PPMED, MOFA would serve as the secretary to the NAC. It is expected that the NAC would
meet once a quarter. At least one of these meetings would coincide with the wrap-up of the joint
GOG/Donors implementation support missions.
The NAC would be assisted by a National AgSSIP Technical Committee (NATC),
comprising: (i) Chief Director, MOFA (Chairperson), (ii) Supervising Technical Director, MOFA;
(iii) all National Directors of MOFA; (iv) Regional Directors of Agriculture, Greater Accra and
Eastern Regions; (v) National AgSSIP Program Administrator (Secretary); (vi) Chief Executive,
Irrigation Development Authority; (vii) CSIR Deputy Director-General (Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries); (viii) five private sector representatives, at least one of whom should be a woman; (ix)
representatives of Ministries of Local Government and Rural Development, Lands and Forestry
and Finance; (xi) representative of EPA; (xii) representative of GCC; and (xiii) Registrar of
Cooperatives. The NATC would meet once a quarter before the meeting of the NST. Its
function would be to provide technical advice and oversight to the agencies implementing the
AgSSIP program as well as review the annual work program and budget and the reports and
policy issues that would be submitted for consideration of the NST.
Regional and district AgSSIP steering committees would also be established to provide
technical and policy guidance as well as oversight to AgSSIP regional and district coordinators
implementing agencies at the regional and district levels. The regional and district agricultural
directors would, respectively be the regional and district AgSSlP coordinators. The Regional
AgSSIP Steering Committee would be chaired by the Regional Coordinating Director and
comprise Regional Director of Agriculture (Secretary), Regional Forestry Officer, Regional
Feeder Roads Engineer, five private Sector representatives (at least two of whom should be
women), NGO representative, Farmer representative, Regional Planning Officer, Regional Budget
Officer. The District AgSSlP Steering Committee would be chaired by the District Coordinator
and comprise the District Director of Agriculture (Secretary), the District Agricultural
Committee, five private Sector representatives (at least one of whom should be a woman), NGO
representative, Farmer's representative. Assurances were obtained from MOFA that the national,
regional and district AgSSIP steering committees would be put in place by September 30, 2000.

Financial Management. In line with the decentralized implementation arrangements and
moving the Finance Unit to PPMED, MOFA would establish a financial management system
capable of accurately recording and reporting on information on the resources and expenditures
under to program and in conformity with the World Bank's requirements for accounting, auditing
and project management reporting. The system would also be capable of identifying the source of
funding for different activities or tracing what activities were financed by specific donor and GOG
funds. MOFA has commissioned a consultant to modify and consolidate the computerized
accounting systems in MOFA to serve the needs of financial management and control under
AgSSIP, prepare a detailed financial and accounting procedures manual that documents the
operations of the financial management and control system as part of the project implementation
manual (PIM), and train accounts staff. This financial manual would detail the budgeting,
accounting, reporting and funds flow mechanism from the center to the regions and districts under
the program and the recording and reporting responsibilities required for releases of funds at each
level of implementation.
Funds Flow Mechanism.  The financial manual would provide the detailed step by step
requirements for funds to be released from the center to the districts for program activities. Some
district agricultural departments have their accounting staff, whilst others have to rely on
accounting staff at district assemblies to perform accounting duties for them. This has resulted in
the lack of submission of quality, relevant and timely reports to the center for the purposes of
financial monitoring. Since the program recognizes that any funds flow arrangements would
require that the weaknesses at the district level such as inadequate skills, insufficient and untimely
financial reporting, lack of forward planning and in adequate supervisory and control oversight
over financial resources, would be addressed through training and strengthening of financial
management at the district level, in collaboration with other sector programs addressing these
problems.
Project Financial Management Reporting. The World Bank has introduced the Loan
Administration Change Initiative (LACI) to facilitate loan administration. LACI has been formally
launched in Ghana and it is expected that all projects would comply fully with this new
requirement at start of implementation or put in place an action plan to ensure compliance in 12 to
18 months of commencement of implementation. LACI requires projects to prepare quarterly
management reports in the areas of finance, procurements, including contract details and project
progress. The quarterly financial report consists of project fund sources and statement of uses of
funds by project activity, project cash withdrawals, special account reconciliation statement and a
six months project cash forecast. The Quarterly Project Progress Report consists of output
monitoring report on contract management and on unit of output by project activity. The
Quarterly Procurement Management Report consists of procurement process monitoring for
goods and works and for consultants' services, and expenditure reports under these contracts.
Due to the expected new decentralized arrangements, reporting at the MOFA headquarters
would depend on reports from the districts and regions. This would require additional training
and skills to upgrade accounting staff skills before the project is able to comply fully with the
LACI-PMR requirements at the beginning of project implementation. However, assurances were
- 80 -



obtained that PCD would be in a position to comply with LACI requirements within the stipulated
12-18 months period.

Annex 4
GHANA: Agricultural Services Subsector Investment Project
Link to CAS and to Vision 2020
Vision 202C. whose main thrust is that Ghana would be transformed from a low-income country into a
prosperous middle-income country by the year 2020, critically depends on agriculture spearheading overall
economic growth and poverty reduction. With agriculture's contribution to GDP being so large (36
percent), its rapid growth has indeed important leverage on the overall growth process. To support Vision
2020, the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) formulated the Accelerated Agricultural Growth and
Development Strategy (AAGDS) to increase the sector's annual growth rate from the 4 percent achieved in
1997-1999 to 5-6 percent. The AAGDS, a comprehensive program that covers the whole agriculture
sector (food and indusLial crops, livestock, fisheries, and forestry), includes policy reforms, institutional
arrangements, rural infrastructure, rural finance, and the provision of other agricultural and social services.
This strategy is consistent with the Government of Ghana's (GOG) two basic orientations: (i) reliance on
the private sector; and (ii) devolution of responsibilities from central government to District Assemblies
(DA). The proposed Agricultural Services Subsector Investment Program (AgSSIP) is the major
instrument for implementing Ghana's AAGDS. AgSSIP is specifically identified in the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) as the main instrument of future Bank support to the agriculture sector.
Analysis of alternatives
Rationale for a Public sector investment. AgSSIP is a public investment program supporting private
sector activities in agricultural production. Could the private sector have provided AgSSIP services? With
the on-going cocoa reform, the GOG is completing its total withdrawal from the production, processing,
and marketing of agricultural products and inputs. AgSSEP concems itself with core public sector
functions, such as (i) creating and maintaining the enabling economic and institutional framework for the
private sector and civil society; (ii) providing strategic direction to the agriculture sector; (iii) providing
decentralized service delivery that cannot be carried out solely by the private sector or civil society; (iv)
engaging in capacity building and human development activities with large, upfront investments and with
long pay-back periods and externalities; and (v) providing functions targeted to smallholder farmers in rural
areas and to other disadvantaged groups. At the same time, AgSSIP will help the GOG to further involve
the private sector and civil society .in agricultural development and poverty reduction, through the
co-production and out-contracting of the provision of key public services. These features provide a
justification for a public investment operation.
Programmatic Choice. The proposed AgSSIP is a departure from the traditional approach of
financing agricultural development via numerous stand-alone, discrete projects. Discrete agricultural
projects in Ghana have well-known major drawbacks: (i) poor coordination and low impact; (ii)
inflexibility in allocation of donor and Government counterpart resources across the sector, (iii) absence of
prioritization in public expenditure emanating from weak public expenditure management, particularly in
counterpart funds; (iv) wastage, duplication and fiagmentation of government's management of aid and
strain on financial and human resources, resulting from proliferation of project implementation
arrangements and management units, and differing or inconsistent donor implementation and accounting
procedures; (v) lack of participation of stakeholders in project preparation and imnplementation, inadequate
capacity building because of dependence on technical assistance; and (vi) programs driven by donor agenda
rather than national priorities, resulting in poor national commitment.
AgSSlP avoids these pitfills: (i) it covers the entire country's agriculture sector rather than discrete
- 83 -



sectors or geographical areas; (ii) it has been prepared by Ghanaian staff within a coherent policy
framework (AAGDS) and will be implemented within the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Agriculture
(MOFA), so that it builds ownership and capacity; (iii) it will be financed by key donors active in the sector
and the donors' procedures for procurement, reporting, accounting, and auditing would be standardized as
much as possible; (iv) technical assistance, mostly short-term, would be supplied on demand from AgSSIP'
s stakeholders; (v) AgSSIP has a built-in flexibility because it espouses a demand-driven APL format,
which only goes forward if triggers are met; (vi) AgSSIP is embedded in public sector reforms in the
agriculture sector aimed at greater decentralization and beneficiary participation; and most importantly (vii)
the proposed program is an increment to on-going activities that will be integrated under the framework of
AgSSIP. These features should ensure greater project efficiency, as well as more ownership, capacity
building, and sustainability than past discrete projects in Ghana.
Macro-economic stance
Macroeconomic policies implicitly impact agricultural growth and development as much as or more
than, direct sectoral policies (Shiff and Valdes, 1992). Is Ghana's macro economic stance suitable for the
launch of AgSSIP? Ghana's macroeconomic situation turned from "good" in 1990-91 to "poor" in
1996-97, according to a recent World Bank, 15-country comparative study on Agricultural Incentives in
Sub-Saharan Africa (Townsend, 1999) [Fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policy stance were
combined to create a measure of the overall macroeconomic policy environment" (Townsend, Robert
F. "Agricultural Incentives in Sub-Saharan Africa: Policy Challenges" Washington DC. World Bank
Technical Paper 444)]. Fiscal deficit was high (9.4% of GDP), inflation substantial (37%/o), and parallel
market exchange premium significant (2%). Fiscal excess prior to elections in 1992 and 1996 had led to
re-emerging inflationary pressures. The macroeconomic situation, however, started to tum around in 1997.
The domestic primary balance (DPB) recorded a surplus of 3.2 percent of GDP in 1997 and 3.6 percent in
1998 (compared with 0.3 percent in 1996) [The domestic primary balance is defined as domestic
revenue less domestic expenditure, exduding interest payments. A DPB deficit requires borrowing to
cover both this deficit and debt service, thus raising indebtedness and associated inflationary
expectations. A surplus indicates progress for escaping the debt trap]. Inflation was brought down
from 74 percent in 1996 to 16 percent by the end of 1998. However, in 1999, Ghana's fiscal performance
deteriorated owing to extemal shocks caused by a shortfall in donor assistance and unfavorable terms of
trade [According to World Bank Commodity Price Data, average cocoa prices plummeted 32 percent
in 1999, crude oil spot prices soared by 38 percent, and gold prices ended 5 percent lower fter some
recovery in the last quarter]. Improvements in inflation were modest (12.5 percent in 1999) and nominal
interest was seen creeping up to 40 percent. To maintain macroeconomic stability, the govermment has
endeavored to pursue restrictive fiscal and monetary policies [These (proposals) include an increase in
the VAT rate (from 10 to 12.5 percent); enhancement of nontax revenue; increases in petroleum
taxes; limitation of exemptions under the VAT and the tariff code; and a reduction of the minimum
cocoa prices paid by government to producers for lower-quality beans. (Republic of Ghana:
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies of the Government of Ghana for 1999 and 2000,
May 3, 1999)]. The domestic primary surplus is expected to remain level at 3.4 percent of GDP, the
overall fiscal deficit (on a commitment basis) will be 6.7 percent of GDP, and the inflation rate target will
be at or below 8 percent. These developments, along with Ghana's currently liberalized foreign exchange,
will help restore the country's good macro-economic stance.
In the agriculture sector, Ghana has already liberalized domestic agricultural input and output
marketing. The Government is committed to pursuing the liberalization of the cocoa sector, started in 1996
with the opening of the domestic marketing to private traders. Following extensive consultations with
stakeholders in 1999, it approved a widely-distributed medium-term cocoa strategy designed to promote
- 84 -



competition in the domestic market and end the public monopoly in cocoa exports. [linistiy of Finance,
April 1999. Ghana Cocoa Sector Development Strategy. Accra, Ghana] The Cocoa Board has begun to
provide equal access to its crop financing and warehousing facilities to all licensed buying companies. The
Government has sold to the public shares of the Produce Buying Company (PBC), which accounts for 60
percent of local purchases. Despite sharp declines in world prices, the producer price of cocoa for the
1999/2000 crop season was kept at the same nominal level as the 1998/99 season, thus raising the
producers' share of the fo.b. cocoa price to 66 percent, above the minimum target of 60 percent under the
program. The Government is currently reviewing proposals for regulations to allow domestic private
buying companies to export 30% of the 2000/2001 crop purchases.
Thus, the requisite basic macroeconomic and sectoral policies are in place for the launch of AgSSIP.
However, areas of improvement remain, for example, about the overhang of extemal and domestic debt,
which the GOG is committed to tackle with the assistance of the Bank Group and other donors. AgSSIP
would also work to strengthen further the sectoral policy agenda, including the restructuring and
decentralization of MOFA.
Economic analysis
AgSSIP would contribute significantly to the growth of Ghana's economy in several ways. First, it
would benefit agricultural producers by supporting technological change and innovation in crops, livestock,
and fishery production and in agro-processing that would increase their productivity and income. The
participatory approach of technical recommendations address the needs of the poorest firmers, particularly
women, whose increased incomes will help improve food security. Second, AgSSIP would foster a
favorable business environment for private sector-led employment-generating activities, by strengthening
the regulatory framework at the sectoral level. Third, the capacities to advance development at the local
level will be enhanced through the strengthening of farmer-based organizations. Fourth, AgSSIP would
contribute to improved governance by implementing the decentralization of MOFA and public agricultural
services at the District level. Fifth, it would encourage better environmental management by promoting
sustainable agricultural production techniques. Overall, AgSSIP would contribute to poverty reduction,
particularly in rurl areas where poverty is most acute, by raising rural incomes, improving food security,
and empowering grass root organizations, which would be in better position to negotiate for increased
access to social services.
Quantifying the number of the program's beneficiaries is fraught with difficulties because of the
demand-driven nature of the program, and because such an exercise entails double counting. The same
farmers, for example, could benefit from activities in agricultural extension, agricultural research,
farmer-based organizations, and livestock services. The institutional reforms and the decentralization
process have the potential of affecting the whole rural sector. Tentatively, AgSSIP implementing agencies
estimated that by the end of the first phase, some 250,000 farmers would adopt new crop technologies,
many of whom are women farmers Sixty percent of the food crop farrners in Ghana are women,; some
450,000 livestock producers would benefit, including 22,000 in breeding programs, 134,000 in improved
grazing areas; about 100,000 artisan fishermen and 500,000 fish processors and distributors would benefit;
and some 220 farmer-based organizations would be functional. AgSSIP would refine these estimates
during implementation to establish a baseline for monitoring and evaluation.
AgSSIP's benefits are substantial, but most cannot be quantified because they accrue to the entire
sector and, indeed, the whole economy. Other benefits would be generated from activities (e.g., research
and extension programs) to be identified through annual consultations, and not ex-ante. Thus, standard
economic rates of return are not feasible for AgSSIP. For such comprehensive programs, current Bank
- 85 -



standard practice favors a quantitative break-even analysis of the incremental cost and benefits streams at
the national level. See Staff Appraisal Reports of agricultural investment programs in Tunisia (1993),
Morocco (1991): of. Zambia: Agricultural Sector Investment Program (World Bank, (1996) and , Annex
9); Mozambique: Agricultural Sector Public Expenditure Program (World Bank, 1999), Annex 4). To
complement and support the break-even estimates, the analysis provides illustrative estimates of economic
retums for investment in research and extension.
Break-even analysis. Break-even analysis determines the minimum incremental growth in overall
agricultural GDP - and the subsequent stream of value added - required to justify the proposed cost
stream of the program. The key assumption is that AgSSIP's marginal contribution to AGDP - which is
expected to be large but could not be calculated ex-ante for lack of appropriate analytical tools - would
easily exceed the minimum growth rate. The results (Table 1) show very low minimum growth rates of
0.14 to 0.15 percent are required, depending on the time lag assumed for AgSSIP to start realizing its
benefits. The minimum growth rates for components taken individually are noticeably small. Furthermore,
one should keep in mind that agricultural GDP cannot capture all AgSSIP's benefits, such as poverty
reduction, food security and better environment management. AGDP does not even capture the value-added
either in agro-processing (attributed to the industry sector) or in the domestic trade and exports of
agricultural products (attributed to the service sector) that would result from AgSSIP's support to the
agriculture sector.

Real average annual growth of agricultural GDP rose fom negative levels in the 1970s (-1 percent) to
positive in the 1980s (1 percent), broke the 2 percent barrier in matching population growth in the 1990s
(2.7 percent in 1990-97), and accelerated at the end of the century (over 4 percent from 1996 to 1999).
Although impressive in SSA's context, this late agricultural growth spurt was uneven and, while it matched
- 86-



the target growth rate of the medium-case scenario, it was still below that of the high-case expectation (6
percent and higher) of the AAGDS. It is widely believed, however, that the agriculture sector is quite
capable of matching at least the minimum 4 percent growth already achieved. Even with the drops in cocoa
prices, agriculture was a leading sector in 1999 with real growth of 5.3 percent. Therefore, it is quite
feasible that the agriculture sector will grow at least by 0.15 percent per year to justify the cost of AgSSIP.
Strong empirical evidence lends support to this proposition. During 1990-97, total factor productivity in
Ghana's agriculture was estimated at 3 percent, the third highest among 15 SSA countries (Townsend,
1999). In estimating TFP (in fact multiple factor productivity because of data constraint), Multiple factor
productivity is decomposed into technical efficiency (a movement toward the production frontier) and
technology change (a shift in the production frontier itself). Although technical efficiency (use of available
technology) contributing some 90 percent and technical change 10 percent to this growth, MOFA's
statistics indicate that actual yields in most food crops are still well below achievable yields given currently
available techniques. For example, yields of three of the most widely grown food crops (maize, cassava,
and millet) could improve more than two fold (Table 2). There is, therefore, ample room for Ghanaian
farmers to move to their production frontier from improvements in policies and agricultural extension.
MOFA's farm budget estimates also indicate profitability of improved technological packages in these
crops. AgSSIP would support agricultural research, which will further expand this production frontier.

Profitability of Research and Extension Investments. Several ex post analyses have shown high rates of
return of investments in agricultural research and extension (R&E). An IFPRI review of 294 studies
(Alston, Marra, Pardey and Wyatt, 1999 "A Meta-Analysis of Rates of Return to Agricultural R&D")
shows average retums to research investments alone of 88 percent, extension alone averaging 79 percent,
and research and extension combined averaging 45 percent. In Sub-Saharan Africa, high rates of retums on
R&E are reported in Mali (maize), Zambia (maize); Kenya (maize); Uganda (maize, groundnuts, sesamne,
maize, beans, cassava, cooking bananas), and in Senegal (cotton). The economic surplus method, a
Best-Practice approach to analyze the economic rate of retum (ERR) to R&E, was used in Ghana to
estimate retums of R&E on cowpeas (ERR of 52 percent), pineapples (ERR of 78 percent), and maize

for effective evaluation, priority setting and impact assessment of R&E on an ongoing basis.
Fiscal analysis
Of interest is the financial sustainability of the project in the context of the fiscal discipline GOG pursues to
maintain a stable macroeconomic fiamework. Would the Govemment allocate adequate funds to cover the
incremental recurrent costs during implementation and over the life of the project? Ghana's historical
support to agriculture provides a useful background to this analysis. This assessment looks at AgSSIP's
cost in the context of the current medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) estimates, and includes an
analysis of the incremental cash flow of government finance, mechanisms of cost recovery, and a review of
counterpart funds.
Public Expenditures in Agriculture.
Expenditures in the agriculture sector increased in real terms during 1995-1997, but declined sharply in
1998 and 1999 (Table 3). By contrast, real recurrent expenditures - dominated by wages and salaries,
which were boosted in 1999 - have improved from 1995-97 to 1998-99. All other indicators of the level of
agricultural expenditures show deterioration from 1995-97 to 1998-1999 periods. Most notably are the
declining shares of agricultural expenditures in total GOG spending, overall GDP and Agricultural GDP.

17.   This picture is, however misleading because Government's support to the sector also includes rural
infrastructure and social services (basic education, health, potable water) provided to rural populations.
The Government emphasizes the private nature of agriculture as opposed to the social sector, which needs
direct public support. Also compared to recent past, current public support to agriculture has shifted away
from cocoa to the non-cocoa sub-sector (Table 4). In fact higher support to agriculture in the 1980s
included wasteful commitments tbat have been eliminated. Furthermore, these direct interventions did not
reverse the overall negative impact of government policies on agriculture. During the 1980s, Ghana, along
with Cote d'Ivoire and Zarnbia were singled out as countries with the most severe (implicit and explicit)
taxation on agriculture (Shiff and Valdes, 1992).

Notwithstanding the clear trend in the diversification of Government support to agriculture, Government
expenditures in the sector remain dominated by recunrent costs and, within this category, by wages and
salaries. Furthermore, actual expenditures are often at great variance with approved allocations. When
draconian cuts must be made because of over-optimistic budget projections, expenditures on the military,
wages and interest spending are spared and the cut falls heavily on other categories without concem to
development priorities. The Govenmment's financing requirements to service a rapidly increasing domestic
debt have remained large. With treasury bill rates averaging over 40 percent in 1995-97 and around 27
percent in 1998, interest payments of domestic debt has climbed from 2.2 percent of GDP in 1992 to
around 5 percent in 1997 and 1998 (World Bank, 1999). Interest payment on domestic debt (cedis 861.4
billion) was four times higher than on extemal debt (cedis 215 billion) in 1998. Clearly, AgSSIP would
help the GOG reaffirm its commitment to supporting the agriculture sector. Cost recovery and other
revenue generation, however, are required from the sector, given that part of cocoa taxes is needed for

AgSSIP Within the MTEF. In 1999, the GOG adopted the Medium Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF) to serve as a coherent funding mechanism for its development strategy. The MTEF aligns GOG
and donors funds with what is affordable over the medium term and the annual budget; allocates spending
based on policy priorities; and aims at producing intended results at least costs. The current MTEF,
2000-2002 (Table 4) accounts for the on-going activities of AgSSIP, but not yet for the incremental first
phase AgSSIP being appraised. The MTEF will be readily modified during the 2001-2003 MTEF
preparations, once this new funding requirement is determined by GOG and donors negotiations.

While financing of AgSSIP calls for a substantial increase in donors' contribution (150%) over current
level of the agriculture sector MTEF, it requires only a modest increase (18%) in GOG's contribution.
Furthermore, GOG's net-of-tax contribution will amount to about 2 percent over the MTEF for the
implementing agencies (Table 5). This modest increase is designed to ensure that affordable GOG
- 90 -



financing will be available and committed during implementation of the first phase of AgSSIP.
Incremental Cash Flow of Government Finance. This analysis deals with the stream of GOG
expenditures and revenue associated with the first phase of AgSSIP over the repayment period of the credit.
Net cash outflow includes incremental recurrent costs during implementation and the life of the project, and
reimbursement Forty years to maturity, 10 years grace period, service charge 0.75% on principal amount
withdrawn and outstanding, with principal repayment at the rate of 2 percent per year of the credit amount
from the eleventh to the twentieth year, and 4 percent per year thereafter (Bank Operational Policy 3.10,
January 1995). The commitment charge is assumed waived for the credit line from IDA and AfDB (other
donors' contributions are grants). Net cash inflow, which includes incremental cost recovery and tax
revenues (import, income, and VAT) related to the program could not be estimated with reliability during
appraisal. Thus, only the cash outflow is analyzed to shed light on GOG allocations (including inflows
from cost recovery mechanisms) to cover these expenditures.
Only a minimum growth rate of 0.03 percent of the agricultural GDP would be required to generate
revenue to break even with the stream of GOG's cash outflow over the life of the credit. The NPV of total
Govermment's fiscal commitment related to the program (reimbursement of credit and incremental recurrent
cost) is about cedis 138 billion, which represent about 32 percent of the 1998 cocoa export tax. NPV of
the credit repayment is about cedis 40 billion, which represent about 10 percent of cocoa export taxes. One
should note that the credit repayment is made from GOG's general budget and not from line ministry
budgets (Table 6). Overall, the fiscal burden of the first phase of AgSSIP is not overbearing.
A key assumption of the cash-flow analysis is that the government will continue to support recurrent cost
five more years after the end of the first phase, before these costs taper off. Given this assumption, GOG
recurrent costs actually rise after implementation of the first phase because it was supporting a very modest
sum during implementation: 22 percent of the total recurrent costs (and 18% net-of-tax) at the end of first
phase. Strong commitment is needed from government to continue its support of the program after
implementation. This also serves to demonstrate the critical importance of firmly establishing, during
implementation, the cost-sharing mechanisms and other revenue generating mechanisms that will relieve.
Mechanisms for Cost Recovery. AgSSIP is set to introduce innovative approaches in commercialization,
privatization, co-production, cost-sharing of agricultural services to enhance the financial sustainability of
these services. These cost sharing and other revenue-generating mechanisms are being developed at many
agencies of MOFA. In the first year of the program, AgSSIP imnplementing agencies would develop
baseline cost estimates of services to be privatized, out-contracted, co-produced, and cost-shared for
monitoring and evaluation of the cost recovery mechanisms. Illustrative mechanisms and estimates of cost
recovery are summarized below.
Plant protection services. In 1999, a total of 235 million cedis was recovered as charges on phytosanitazy
services. These represent only 20 percent of operation costs outside staff salaries. It is estimated that a
review of these charges can boost cost recovery by 10 percent a year until total cost recovery would reach
70 percent of total operation costs by year 6. The following plant protection services to individuals and
organizations are amenable to partial cost recovery. (i) Phytosanitary inspection and certification; (ii) seed
inspection and certification currently provided free of charge; (iii) seed health and germination tests; (iv)
pesticides field bio-efficiency testing; and (vi) laboratory diagnostic services for diseases and pests.
Human Resources - Capacity Building. At the agricultural colleges and training centers, revenue is
generated from sale of produce as a result of training activities. These monies, however, are paid to
Govermment through the controller and Accountant General Departnent. Revenue currently generated from
the institutional fanming activities is estimated at 20 million cedis per year. With AgSSIP, the incremental
revenue generated is estimated to reach 55 million cedis (year 1), 60 million (year 2), 65 million (year 3),
- 91 -



70 million (year 4), 80 million (year 5), and 90 million (year 6 and beyond).
Research and Eictension. Cocoa's current pricing includes a set level of cocoa fo.b. price (3 percent)
eannarked to COCOBOD for extension and research. Thus, implicitly, cocoa farmers pay the full cost of
extension and research they receive. Additionally, Government taxes cocoa export, which is used in
agriculture as well as general development purposes. Therefore, an additional cost recovery mechanism for
cocoa farmers would amount to double taxation. AgSSIP would develop a pilot program, starting with
cotton, oil palm, and pineapple to establish cost-sharing mechanisms of R&E with producers and exporters
of cash crops. Currently, average research time allocated to research on these commodities amounts to 1.7
percent on cotton, 3.8 percent on pineapple, and 5.5 percent on oil palm. CSIR has a general directive of
requiring research institutes to generate 30% of their operating costs from sales of their research results,
produce and services. CSIR will further refine these allocations and determine how much 30 percent of the
research operating costs would represent in terms of farmers' gross and net margin on revenues of cotton,
oil palm, and pineapple production.
Veterinary Services and Animal Production. All vaccinations costs axe currently fully recovered by the
veterinary services. Animal services that can be contracted out to private veteinnay practitioners include
vaccinations and some regulatory services, such as meat inspection and animal movements. Privafization of
veterinary practice would have considerable impact on the economy and government's budget. The
livestock production directorate tentatively estimates that it could privatize some 70-80 percent of the Feed
Quality Control, the National Livestock Breeding Program, the dairy production, and the improvement of
communal grazing areas.
Availability Of GOG Funds. Availability of GOG funds is an indication of the Govemment's
commitment to the project by providing tangible resources to cover incremental recurrent cost during
project's implementation. Ghana has experienced great difficulties in providing government funds to
donor-financed projects when shortfalls in projected revenues occur, which is often the case. AgSSIP being
a sector investment program (SIP), the financing arrangements in would not tie every expenditure category
to specified ratios of GOG funding. While this arrangement will not slow down project implementation
initially, failure by GOG to contribute its promised share, net of taxes, would reduce the total level of
implementation and put in question GOG's commitment to the program.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the economic analysis conducted during appraisal supports the economic rationale of the
program and suggests that the program will reach its objective of spurring growth, increasing incomes of
agricultural producers, processors and distributors and contributing to poverty reduction, particularly in the
rural areas. The fiscal analysis shows that the program, which fits the coherent framework of the MTEF
will be quite affordable. However, to enhance the financial viability of the project, particularly in light of
residual recurrent costs to be supported by Government, cost-recovery mechanisms must be firmly
instituted during implementation. Many of AgSSIP implementing agencies have already started the process
will deepen it during implementation.

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
GHANA: Agricultural Services Subsector Investment Project
Procurement
Guidelines
Procurement of goods and works will follow the Bank's Guidelines under IBRD Loans and
IDA Credits (January 1999 Edition), and Bank Standard Bidding Documents and Standard Bid
Evaluation Report will be used for ICB. National Competitive Bidding (NCB) advertised locally
would be carried out in accordance with procedures and regulations, acceptable to IDA, provided
that they assure economy, efficiency, transparency, and broad consistency with key objectives of
the Bank Guidelines. Under NCB, the procedures should ensure that: (i) methods used in
evaluation of bids and the award of contracts are made known to all bidders and not be applied
arbitrarily; (ii) any bidder is given adequate response time (four weeks) for preparation and
submission of bids; (iii) bid evaluation and bidder qualification are clearly specified in bidding
documents; (iv) no preference margin is granted to domestic manufacturers; (v) eligible firms are
not precluded from participation; (vi) award will be made to the lowest evaluated bidder in
accordance with pre-determined and transparent methods; and (vii) bid evaluation reports will
clearly state the reasons to reject any non-responsive bid.
Procurement of Consultant Services will be in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the
Selection of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January 1999 Edition). The standard
Request for Proposal, as developed by the Bank, will be used for appointment of consultants.
Simplified contracts will be used for short-term and low cost assignments, carried out by firms or
individual consultants. The Government was briefed during pre-appraisal about the features of the
new Consultants Guidelines, in particular with regards to advertisement, bid opening and various
steps of IDA reviews.
Procurement Notices
A General Procurement Notice (GPN) has been prepared and will be published in the United
Nations Development Business after negotiations, to advertise for contract opportunities for
major consulting assignments and ICB for works and goods. It will be updated annually for all
outstanding procurement. The GPN will also be published in the national press or official gazette
for ICB and NCB. Specific procurement Notices [SPN] would [as a minimum] be published in
local newspapers of wide circulation for goods and works contracts to be procured on ICB and
NCB basis and for expression of interest for consultant contracts exceeding US$200,000
equivalent. The Project elements by disbursement category, their estimated costs, and
procurement methods for the first three years are summarized in Table A below. Thresholds for
procurement methods and prior review are summarized in Tables B below.
Procurement Planning
Except for sub-projects under the Agriculture Extension Grants and Farmer-Based
Organizations [FBO] Development Fund, draft global procurement plans covering the three year
project period and annual procurement plans for the first two years of the project showing
contract packages and for each package its estimated cost, procurement method and dates for
-96 -



completing key processing steps from completion of bidding documents to completion of delivery
have been prepared by the Program Coordination Division [PCD] and the Procurement Unit of
the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research [PU/CSIR]. These plans would be finalized and
made part of the Project Implementation Manual [PIM]. By September 30 of each year, PCD
and PU/CSIR would prepare and/or update and send to IDA for review and comments the annual
procurement plans for the following calendar year as part of the annual work program. The
various implementation units [see implementation arrangements] would prepare their annual
procurement plans and send them to PCD and PU/CSIR for incorporation into the annual work
program and for ease of reference in monitoring procurement.
Scope of Procurement
Procurement under the project will involve the following:
Contracts for civil works to be financed under the project are estimated to cost US$16.2
million of which IDA will finance works estimated to cost US$ 9.6 million. The civil works to be
financed by IDA would consist of one major package, i.e. MOFA Headquarters building [US$6.5
million] which be procured by ICB [ICB threshold is fixed at US$ 1.0 million]. This package
would require the services of engineering consultants for design and supervision. The selection of
the engineer would be started immediately after negotiations to ensure early start-up of the
constructions. The other civil works [estimated to cost US$ 9.7 million] consist of small contracts
for new works, rehabilitation and repairs scattered in the various sites in the program districts.
These small packages would be procured by NCB but those below US$50,000 may be procured
on basis of solicitation of quotations from  at least three qualified contractors.  No
pre-qualification will be allowed; post-qualification procedure will be used for all NCB and ICB
contracts . All responsive bids will be evaluated and the lowest evaluated bidder will be
post-qualified before contract award.
Contracts for Goods totaling US$15.0 million to be financed by IDA would be for vehicles
[US$7.5 million] and equipment and materials [US$7.5 million]. Equipment and materials relate
to office equipment and furniture, field equipment, laboratory equipment, livestock purchases, and
communication equipment. ICB procedures would apply to contract packages estimated to cost
more than US$ 200,000. NCB and other procedures would apply to contracts below US$
200,000. Small items such as spare parts, office supplies and consumable, which are normally
available off-the-shelf at competitive prices and which cannot be grouped into contracts of more
than US$30,000 equivalent per contract would be procured through shopping procedures on the
basis of quotations obtained from at least three reputable suppliers, in accordance with procedures
specified in the Procurement Procedures Manual. As the case may be, such goods may also be
procured from UN agencies (UNIPAC or IAPSO) provided each contract does not exceed
US$100,000.
Consulting services totaling US$ 5.8 million to be financed by IDA would be for: (i) design,
preparation and supervision of civil works; (ii) studies; (iii) accounting, auditing and financial
management support; (iv) training and capacity building. Consultant contracts would be packaged
appropriately and selection would be based on competition among qualified short-listed firms or
individuals through Quality-and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) or other methods as appropriate.
Shortlists for contracts costing less than US$200,000 may consist of national firms or individuals
- 97 -



only, but foreign firms who have expressed interest for those contracts will not be excluded from
consideration. Where appropriate, the Bank's Standard Request for Proposals (SRFP) will be
used for the selection of consultants. Advertisement for expressions of interest must be published
for all contracts estimated to cost more than US$ 200,000. The implementation units would
ensure adequate publicity for expressions of interest to get candidacy from consultants. For
audits, engineering and other services of a standard nature, Least-Cost Selection (LCS) would be
the most appropriate method, with the firm with the lowest price being selected provided its
technical proposal received the minimum qualifying mark. Services for lectures and small studies,
which can be delivered by individuals, would be selected through comparison of qualifications
among Individual Consultants (IC) expressing interest in the assignment or approached directly.
Training and Capacity Building to be financed by IDA totaling US$ 13.0 million will
consist of sector strengthening and training activities. As part of the project's Annual Work Plan,
an aggregated training plan [aggregated because each implementing unit would prepare its own
training plan] would be submitted to the Bank by September 30 of each year for IDA's review
and comments before it [training plan] is implemented.
Agriculture Extension Grants and FBO Development Funds estimated to cost US$6.4
million will finance subprojects packaged on basis of demands from the agriculture extension
system and from FBOs. The subprojects will be generated through subproject appraisal and
approval process specified in the PIM and Annex 2 of the PAD. Small contracts for civil works,
goods, consultant services, technical assistance, technical services etc. under subprojects would be
procured on basis of the procedures specified in the Guidelines for Community Participation in
Procurement and elaborated in the PIM for guidance of beneficiaries.
Procurement Capacity assessment.
Procurement under AgSSIP would be carried out by PCD, PU/CSIR and other
implementation units [referred to hereafter as implementation units] i.e. Regional and District
teams and Research Institutes of CSIR. These arrangements are in line with the policy of
decentralized program implementation. The Bank has caried out a procurement capacity
assessment of the PCD and PU/CSIR, which would be responsible for procurement planning and
monitoring, procurement of items to procured centrally and for providing support to the
implementation units. The capacity of PCD and PU/CSIR was rated Fair and the risk low. The
capacity of other implementing units has not been assessed as part of AgSSIP appraisal but their
capacity is assessed as adequate for this project as evidenced by their performance under previous
projects, i.e. the Agriculture Extension Project and the National Agricultural Research Project.
Weaknesses in their capacity would be minimized by support from the PCD and PUICSIR, and
mandatory use of the detailed procurement and financial procedures in the PIM by all
implementing institutions/agencies. Overall procurement arrangements and capacity are rated
adequate to meet the needs of AgSSIP.
Implementation arrangements for procurement
PCD will be responsible for preparing overall procurement plan for items under the project
components of MOFA, desegregating items to be procured centrally by PCD and those to be
procured under decentralized arrangements by MOFA's Regional and District teams, responsible
98 -



for implementing activities under the AgSSIP. The PU/CSIR will be responsible for preparing the
overall procurement plan for items under the CSIL project sub-components, desegregating items
to be procured centrally by PU/CSIR and those to be procured under decentralized arrangements
by the Research Institutes.
PCD and the PU/CSIR will be responsible for procurement under ICB and packages for
vehicles, items for information technology and major contracts for equipment, works and
consultant services. To the extent possible, and in accordance with the overall procurement plans,
PCD and PU/CSIR will delegate to the implementation units procurement of items locally
available in the Districts, minor constructions, small contracts for miscellaneous items of supplies,
services and training and all items under operating costs. PCD and PU/CSIR will have oversight
responsibility for ensuring the implementing units plan procurement and process contracts in a
timely and orderly manner, following correct procurement procedures. Procurement for the eleven
line and technical departnents at MOFA Headquarters will be done by PCD. The RDAs, DDAs
and Heads of Research Institutes will take full responsibility for ensuring AgSSIP procurement is
done in an orderly manner in their respective areas in accordance with procedures in the PKM
following Regional and District Tender Board procedures.
Procurement of goods, works and services under the subprojects will be carried out under
arrangements specified in the Project Implementation Manual and in Annex 2 of the Project
Appraisal Document. The Department of Co-operatives will be responsible only for monitoring
and guiding the implementation of the subprojects under the Development Funds, ensuring
participation of FBO Committee members in specific procurement steps, i.e. preparation and
appraisal of subprojects, processing and award of contracts, supervision and certification of
completed contracts. Use of NGOs for procurement processing and service delivery will be
encouraged at all levels.
The Govemment has given assurances at negotiations that it will:

IDA Reviews.
Contracts financed by IDA above the threshold value of US$200,000 equivalent for goods
and US$250,000 for works will be subject to IDA's prior review procedures. Selective
post-review of contracts awarded below the threshold level will be carried out by Bank staff and
other consultants, as necessary. For consultant services, prior IDA review for the selection of
consultants will include the review of budgets, short-lists, selection procedures, requests for
proposals, evaluation reports, proposals for contract awards, and negotiated contracts. Prior IDA
review will not apply to contracts for the recruitment of consulting firms and individuals estimated
to cost less than US$100,000 and US$50,000 equivalent, respectively. However, the exception
to prior 1DA review will not apply to Terms of Reference of such contracts, regardless of their
value, to single-source hiring, to assignments of a critical nature as determined by IDA, or to
amendments of contracts raising the contract value above the above-mentioned prior review
thresholds. For all consultant contracts subject to prior review, opening the financial envelopes
will not take place prior to receiving the Bank's no-objection to the technical evaluation.
Documents related to procurement below the prior review thresholds will be maintained by the
Government for at least two years after the closing date for ex-post review by auditors and by
IDA supervision missions. For training abroad and in-country, the training plan containing names
of candidates and basis of selection, costs estimates, content of courses, periods of training and
selection of training institutions will be reviewed by IDA annually.
Modification or waiver of the scope and conditions of contracts. Before agreeing to any
material extension, or any modification or waiver of the conditions of contracts that would
increase aggregate cost by more than 15% of the original price, the Borrower should specify the
reasons thereof and seek IDAs prior no-objection for the proposed modification. (The value share of
the cotracts subject to prior review with respect to total project cost is lower than 0% which is usualy expected for
most operations, because of a large number of smal contrats spread geographically in remote areas to be
generated under this project).

Disbursement
Allocation of credit proceeds (Table C)
The proposed allocation of the credit is shown in Table C below. The IDA credit will be disbursed over a
period of three and a quarter years (from 2000 to 2004), with a closing date of November 30, 2003. For
contracts below the prior review threshold, disbursements will be made against statements of expenditure
(SOEs) certified by the Program Coordinator and the Financial Controller of the PCD for the MOFA, and
the Director of Finance and the Project Coordinator for the CSIR component. Supporting documentation
will be retained by the executing agencies and will be available for review as requested by IDA supervision
missions and Project auditors. The Financial Controller of the PCD will provide technical assistance and
monitoring to the decentralized district account officers.

Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs):
Disbursements may be made on the basis of statements of expenditure to replenish the special
account for expenditures for (i) civil works under contracts costing less than US$250,000
equivalent each; (ii) goods under contracts costing less than US$200,000 equivalent each; (iii)
consultants' services (firm) under contracts costing less than US$100,000 equivalent each; (iv)
consultants' services (individuals) under contracts costing less than US$50,000 equivalent each;
and (v) all incremental operating cost and training cost. Supporting documentation for SOEs
would be retained by the borrower for review by IDA missions and extemal auditors. All
expenditures above the threshold indicated above will be eligible for direct payment.
Special account:
To facilitate disbursement, two special accounts, SA - A and SA - B, for MOFA and CSIR
respectively will be established at a commercial bank acceptable to IDA with an authorized
allocation of US$2,000,000 million for SA-A and US$1,000,000 million for SA-B. Upon credit
effectiveness and submission of a withdrawal request by the Borrower, an initial deposit of US $
1,000,000 million for SA-A and US$500,000 million for SA-B (representing 50 % of the
authorized allocation) will be deposited in the Special Accounts. Once payments through the
- 104 -



Credit have totaled SDR 5,000,000 million, the full amount of the Special Account can be
claimed. As soon as the financial management system can provide, with reasonable assurance,
accurate and timely information on the status of the Project once the action plan is complete,
steps will be taken to move to a Project Management Reports (PMR)-based disbursement
method. But in the interim period, replenishments of the Special Account will be made on the
basis of monthly applications supported by full documentation of SOEs as required and verified by
the Project Coordination Unit.
Counterparts Funds, Project Account
The government will open in a financial institution, two project accounts, one for MOFA,
which will manage expenditures for all components except agricultural research, and another for
the CSIR, which will manage expenditures for agricultural research, to be used exclusively to
meet expenditures under the Project. The Borrower will deposit into the MOFA and CSIR
Accounts an initial amount in Cedis to the equivalent of, respectively US$400,000, and
US$250,00. The establishment of these accounts will be a condition of Credit Effectiveness. The
initial amount was communicated to the Borrower at negotiations.
Summary of Financial Management Assessment
Background. The Govemment of Ghana is currently undertaking major financial and
structural reforms to improve the control environment of its public sector accounting and
reporting systems. The Auditor General's Department, which is the supreme audit institution in
the country, responsible for the auditing of the Government of Ghana accounts (the consolidated
fund), and for all government ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) is also included in
these reforms. In spite of these reforms it is believed that the overall control environment within
the public sector is currently weak, however this is expected to improve when the on going
reforms begin to be effective.
These reforms have resulted in the introduction of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF) budgeting system in the country and work is progressing to computerize GOG
accounting system. All MDAs are required to prepare their budgets using the MTEF. The GOG
budget for 1999 and 2000 have all being prepared using this new budgeting system.
Project Implementation Arrangements. Three sector ministries (Ministries of Food and
Agriculture (MOFA); Environment, Science & Technology (MEST); and Employment & Social
Welfare (MOESW) ), the private sector, community-based organizations, NGOs and a number of
think tanks (CSIR, ISSER, CEPA and university faculties) will be involved in the implementation
of AgSSIP.
The Program Co-ordination Division (PCD) within the Policy, Planning, Monitoring and
Evaluation Department (PPMED) of MOFA would be the lead agency co-ordinating the overall
implementation through the provision of financial control, procurement, monitoring, evaluation
and reporting services. The Research component under the Project will be implemented by the
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). The PCD will receive periodic reports
-105 -



from CSIR to enable them consolidate and present all the needed reports to the oversight
committee and all donors.   The overall organization and management structure for
implementation of AgSSIP would be consistent with the Government's decentralized local
government and rural development system which has started to devolve power and responsibility
of central government to the 10 regional councils and 110 district assemblies.
Agricultural services provided under the AgSSIP and resources required to implement them
would be channeled in agreed arrangements that would reinforce and support GOG's
decentralization program. The major implementation of delivery of agricultural services will take
place at the district level and to some extent at the regional level. In the case of the Research
components which would be carried out by the participating research institutions and coordinated
by the CSIR secretariat would also reinforce the existing administrative reporting arrangements.
Budgeting Under the Project. The budget of MOFA for the period 2001 to 2003 will be
prepared using the MTEF and will include the funds to be provided under the AgSSIP Project.
Although the AgSSIP resources will be part of the MOFA' s budget, funds under the Project will
not be released as part of GOG budgetary resources, but a parallel financial system will be put in
place to manage the Project funds. Districts will be required to prepare their annual programs and
related budgets for funding under the AgSSIP.
Financial Management. In line with the decentralized implementation arrangements and
moving the Finance Unit to PPMED, MOFA has engaged a consultant to review its current
financial management system in line with this new arrangement. This system should be capable of
accurately recording and reporting on information on all the resources and expenditures under the
Project (this should include GOG and all donor resources) and in conformity with the World
Bank's requirements for accounting, auditing and project management reporting. The system will
also be capable of identifying the source of funding for different activities or tracing what
activities were financed by specific donor funds.
Since the Project recognizes that any funds flow arrangements will require that the
weaknesses at the district level as identified in previous work, such as inadequate skills,
insufficient and untimely financial reporting, lack of forward planning and in adequate supervisory
and control oversight over financial resources, will be addressed through training and
strengthening of financial management at the district level, in collaboration with other sector
programs.
MOFA has compiled the list of the profile of the district accounts staff, their qualifications,
and their training needs, to ensure that any training will be both relevant and comprehensive and
achieve the objective of improving the skills, recording and reporting from the districts level. We
have reviewed this list and noted that some Districts Directorates of Agriculture are without
accounting staff. Accounting staff must be sent to these offices before resources are sent to the
identified Districts.
The CSIR will be responsible for the implementation and financial management of the
Research component under the Project. Under a previous project, the National Agricultural
Research Project (NARP), CSIR has been equipped with computerized accounting system and
- 106 -



financial procedures manual for its operations, which is functioning effectively and meeting all the
financial reporting requirements of CSIR. The manual has been reviewed and found to be
adequate to meet the accounting requirements under this component. The computerized system
will be modified to be able to provide the additional financial reporting requirements under
AgSSIP. The accounting system will also be modified to enable CSIR to generate the PMR
reports within an agreed time table.
Accounting Process. The project books of accounts will be kept on cash basis. In addition, a
memorandum statement will be kept for all unpaid liabilities to ensure that all project liabilities are
recorded and accounted for. MOFA shall maintain fixed assets register for all its assets, and
especially for the Project assets. The project coordinating division (PCD) within the PPMED will
be responsible for co-ordinating financial information, flow of funds to the districts and ensuring
timely reporfing from the districts of the Project (all except the research component) on a regular
basis. As implementation will take place at the district level the district accounting staff will be
responsible for the recording the books at the district level and submit regular statement of
expenditures on the Project activities to the finance unit in Accra. As part of the project
implementation manual (PM), a modified financial and accounting procedures manual which
documents this new decentralized operations of the financial management system is being
prepared. The manual will detail the new budgeting, accounting, reporting arrangements and
funds flow mechanism from the center to the regions and districts under the Project and the
recording and reporting responsibilities required for releases of funds at each level of
implementation.
The finance unit will be equipped to maintain a computerized project financial management
system. This will also aid the preparation of Project Management Reports (PIMRs).
CSIR will use its existing structures to account for resources under the Project. This will be
done in a manner that will allow donors as well as GOG resources to be accounted for separately.
Staffing Arrangements Although MOFA has decentralized its operations, the overall GOG
decentralization process in incomplete, and as such resources for the implementation of the
AgSSIP (at least for the first phase) Project will not be channeled through the existing budgetary
system. It is expected that during the this first phase, disbursement of funds from MOFA HQ (
the center) to the district MOFA departments and accounting for them will be done through a
parallel system similar to that operating currently through the PCU.
The finance unit will be headed by a financial controller (FC) who must be an experience and
qualified accountant with adequate experience in both IDA and GOG systems ( TOR has been
prepared). The FC must be capable of planning, designing and implementing training programs for
junior staff in the unit, and setting up of financial accounting systerns. The current financial
controller at the old PCU will continue as the FC for AgSSIP until a new FC is appointed
preferably from the Controller and Accountants' General Department. Four other accounting
staff, who must be partly qualified accountants with adequate experiences in IDA and GOG
accounting systems requirements, would help the FC. The staff profiles of all accounting staff
provided by the Ministry of Agriculture have been reviewed and four such key staff have been
nominated to assist the FC.
- 107 -



As the accounting functions at the district level will be performed by the Ministry's district
account officers, a similar assessment of the district accounting staff has been carried out to
identif,v the quality, availability and adequacy to cany out the tasks required under the Project.
Areas where no such staff exist have been identified for action.
The CSIR overall accounting function is headed by a Director of Finance, with several
divisions including one responsible for projects undertaken by CSIR This unit has a team of four
accounting staff, the senior is partly qualified with the institute of chartered accountants Ghana,
and an M.Sc. in Finance. The rest have varying qualifications (1 degree in accounting and 2 A
level accounting holders), and have work on previous Bank funded projects thereby acquiring the
needed experiences. The present staff strength and experiences are adequate to undertake
accounting activities under AgSSIP.
Control Risks Areas Identified. Due to the decentralized implementation arrangements
which will require accounting staff in the districts to submit accounting information to the center
for consolidation, there is the risk that the financial information will not be submitted on a timely
manner, and reporting under the PMR system will be delayed. All accounting staff at the Districts
are seconded by the Controller and Accountant General's Department (C&AGD). There is a
further risk that trained District Accounting staff will be transferred, and be replaced by other staff
who will require new training.
Auditing Arrangements. The audit of the project will be conducted annually and carried out
by independent and qualified auditors acceptable to the Bank. The selection of auditors shall be
on competitive basis in accordance with the Bank's consultants' selection guidelines. The audit
report will be submitted to the Bank within 5 months after the end of the reporting period. The
terms of reference for the audit will require the auditors to provide in their report separate
opinions on: (i) the project financial statements to ensure that Project funds have been used in
accordance with the DCA; (ii) that the SOEs submitted for reimbursement during the year, are
properly supported by formal contracts and invoices and other relevant documents; (iii) that the
project special account (SA) have been operated in accordance with IDA procedures and have
been used for the payment of eligible expenditures.
As there will be two special accounts, the audit will be required to report and issue opinions
on each SA separately, and this fact should be contained in the terms of reference.
Project Monitoring and Reporting
The Bank has introduced a new initiative, the Loan Administration Change Initiative (LACI).
This initiative has been formally launched in Ghana and it is expected that all projects will comply
fully with this new requirement at the start of implementation or put in place an action plan to
ensure compliance in 12 to 18 months of commencement of implementation. LACI requires
projects to prepare quarterly projects management reports (PMRs) in the areas of finance,
procurements including contract details and project progress.
- 108-



The Quarterly Financial Reports consist of Sources of funds and their Uses of Funds,
statement of Uses of Funds by Project Activity, Project Cash Withdrawals, Special Account
Reconciliation statement and a six months Project Cash Forecast. Quarterly Project Progress
Report consists of Output Monitoring Report on contract Management and on Unit of Output by
project activity. Quarterly Procurement Management Report consists of procurement process
monitoring for goods and works and that for consultants' services, and contract Expenditure
reports for goods, works and consultants' services.
The financial management assessment conducted indicated that the project will not be able to
produce all the required project management reports at effectiveness date. An action plan was
agreed at negotiations to make the Project compliant 12 months after project effectiveness.

Dear M- Wolfensohn,
A GP1CULTURAL SERVICES SUB-SECTOR INVESTMENT PROGRAMME
LETTER OFAGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTPOLICY
Backgt jun
A nXiculture remains the dominant secto- of the Ghanaian economy; contri;- ting in
1998 at, .)ut 40 percent to the GDP and 44 pl: -cent of total export earnings. It pros ides a
livelih vd in terms of employment for about 57 percent of the population. The in'ustrial
sector , z)ends on agriculture as a source of raw materials. The Government of Ghana
(GOG) knerefore, attaches high priority vl the sector's role in promoting grovy .', and
reducing, poverty. This letter highlights tht: 3ector's main constraints and the Gover': ments'
strategi', to address them. This policy a.3d the strategy framework will be usEd by
Governnent to determine the design and implementation of the proposed IDA anr. other
donor  y t- ported Agricultural Services Sub-Sector Investment Programme.
Strategies and Action Programs
GOG has formulated an Accelerated Agricultural Growth and Development
Strateg- (AAGDS) in support of Ghana's Vision 2020. The strategy is informed by its
econoir ic and social development programmes, whose overriding aim is the redaction of
poverty and general improvement in the we-4are of Ghanaians. Given the importance of
agricu7, !re in the Ghanaian economy and the close association of poverty with small-scale
farming ..specially in the savanna areas, this strategy is designed to increase the agr :ulture
sector's- average annual growth rate from the current 4% (1995-99) to 6% over the medium
term (2001-2010) in order to achieve susai-nable food security and a broad-based growth
within t gender-sensitive framework. The strategy covers all the five sub-se ztors of
agriculture including crops, livestock, fisheries, forestry and cocoa. It is consists'.it with
two ba, Ic orientations of government, i.e. reliance on the private sector to lead investment
and economic growth, and devolution of significant responsibilities from central
govermment to District Assemblies.
-I116-



The policies and programmes designed to achieve the objective of the accelerated
growth and development strategy are based on five major elements, which are to be
implemented through a number of agricultural development programmes:
i.  Promotion of selected products through improved access to markets;
ii.  Development and improved access to technology for sustainable natural
resource management;
iii. Improved access to agricultural financial services;
iv  Improved rural infrastructure; .
v.  Enhanced human resources ant institutional capacity.
Tei, Agricultural Services Sector Investment Programme (AgSSIP), addressin  three
of its five elements, is the main instrume ; for the implementation of the Accelerated
Agicultiral Growth and Development Strategy. The goal of AgSSIP is to help reduce
poverty and improve food secunrty by providing essential agricultural services and securing
an enabiing environment for equitable growth and sustainable use of natural resources.
S.=ecific objectives are to: (i) pro.:'iote effective demand-driven agric ultural
technc 6gies for accelerating agricultural growth on a sustainable basis; (ii) i. prove
farmer- t ssed organizations' capability to provide input distribution, credit, processicig and
market; !g services and to empower them s- that they can participate in priority sett    and
decisioii-making in agricultural and cc- munity development prograrmmes; anid (iii)
promot- decentralization of agricultural dtrelopment by strengthening the capacities. of: (a)
regional md district govermnents in plann.ng and implementing agricultural devc&t pment
prograr .ies; and (b) central ministries and agencies to focus on policy formtlation,
planning, monitoring, evaluation, technica lack-stopping and information and regcalatory
services.
A gSSIP is a long-term programme aimed at supporting the Government's agri6altural
developinent goals by rationalizing the sectoral public expenditure and the roles c 'MOFA
and other MDAs closely related to agricultural development, as well as by improving the
effectiveness of policy formulation, regulations, and services provision in the sector
AgSSIP comprises the core elements of support that should be provided effectively by the
public 'ector to the farming community and related business enterprises in order tn allow
them to make effective contribution towards the attainment of the growth targets for the
sector.
The section below highlights some of the main actions the Governmnut will
irnplen _.it in the medium term to deepen recent and on-going reforms and provde the
framework for donor assisted programmes in the agriculture sector. These meastLres are
aimed at promoting a dynamic supply response, particularly from the smallholdei sector.
The mri1n elements involve maintaining macro-economic stability in the domestic and
extemal accounts and ensuring that macro-economic policies promote an efficient and
dynamic agriculture sector.  Other azeas are improved agricultural support s,ervices
includiig research, extension, input supply and marketing and post harvest management;
increased private sector participation in agricultural development; strengthening agriculture
sector management, gender mainstreaming in the agricultural development paradigm;
-l117-



poverty alleviation and the development of viable and self sustaining farmer based
organisations.
ln order to take the full advantage of these policies, AgSSIP will support the
strengthening of specific MOFA  capabilities that are appropriate for decenr alised
management and that would allow MOFA to effectively promote private sector agricultural
growth. MOFA departments and directoraes will be strengthened to monitor and eviluate
progralji;nes and policies under the stratsgy and to advise farmers, processors, raders,
export- rs and agro-business and expor' producers and traders on technologi-s and
infornir r on on both intemal and extemal i v: ar iet trends.
i gSSIP comprises four sub programmes (i) reforming and strengthein,mg the
agricull ,al technology  generation  an I diffusion  system; (ii) restructurizih  and
strengA ening the Ministry of Food and Agriculture; (iii) developing farnm-based
organis Aion; and (iv) capacity building in agi; zultural education and training.
Agricultural  lechnology  Generation  And  Diffusion:  Research.    The
Goverrinents' objective is to establish a cost-effective and sustainable research system to
generatw technology that is responsive to farmer's needs, especially the resource poor.
While tVae Council for Scientific and In& strial Research (CSIR) will primarily lead the
technol e ay generation process, the univer.:: ' :.s and other development institutions -A7l play
a vital -e on achieving the strategy. '.1he strategy will promote collaboration. among
MOF.i  research institutions, farmers band the uhiversities.  With such a 1t vel of
collabtx . tion within the context of the National Agricultural Research Strateg,', it is
expected that the appropriate research activ-.ies of relevance to national priorities ain; needs
will be ltrmulated for the development of new and labour saving technologies thot will
increas. agricultural productivity and will  Ie affordable and friendly to the enviromxneiit. A
Comre itive Agricultural Research Grant Scheme would be established to make :search
demand e driven and promote excellence by e:.c.couraging researchers, including tho;e in the
private sector, compete for the limited reseai .h funds available rather than allocatin- g these
through the budget system.
Agricultural Technology Generation And Diffudon: Extension. The extension
strategy is aimed to improve its systemic effectiveness through (i) unification of extension
services (ii) upgrading of the technical competence of the extension staff through training
and (iii) use of modified T & V system as the main instrument for the managemen of the
extension- system. The involvement of the private sector, i.e. FBO's, NGO's, agribusiness
and individual firms would be encouraged in the delivery of extension services. An
Extension Development Fund would be established to promote their participation for co-
producJion of extension services. It is clear that the govermnent will not be able to achieve
its poveity reduction objectives through strengthening agricultural extension services alone.
Also needed are complementary inputs in health and education services, as "vell as
investment in rural infrastructure. To achieve the objective of reducing rural poverty,
govern-nent will: (i) review and (where necessary) undertake studies on the causes and
perceptions of rural poverty aimed at identifying the main constraints to poverty reduction
in rur2i areas, (ii) based on these studies, facilitate the development of district extension
services which combine key health concems (including HIV/AIDS), education (including
non-formal) and agricultural initiatives of relevance to the nrual poor, and (iii) ensure equity
-1 18-



in the benefits of agricultural development programmes by improving access to services
and other resources by vulnerable groups, including women, and the youth.
Govemment is committed to the unified agricultural extension system whereby a
single extension agent is responsible in diffusing agricultural technology among farmers
with the support of extension supervisors and subject matter specialists. It is in this context
that Government decided to merge extension services of COCOBOD under t'Pkose of
MOFA. The pilot merger in five districtr has shown it can work effectively. MOFA will
conduc t t reorientation and training progr. im to equip extension agents in cocoa anci coffee
production and marketing technologies.
I puts supply, Pricine and Markef_in. An important element of the Mediiuni Term
Agrici - tural Development Plan (MTADP) was the greater reliance on the private .;ie.tor for
the provision of services. This objective was largely achieved with gove-ment M it ,.drawal
from p ice determination and price support operations in the agricultural sector, kew cept in
the case. of cocoa), introduction of cost recov'zry for veterinary drugs and total prinvaisation
of ferti lizer marketing. Govermnent is committed to pursue the cocoa sector re-form it
launch;e in 1999, including opening up 30 percent of the export market to the private
sector in the 2000/2001 cocoa season. Private sector access to markets will be improved
throughi information, regional negotiatior and adjustments in the regulatory proces.ies. To
improav  the competitiveness of farmers aid processors in the global market, ,elected
produ-,: in which Ghana has comparati-. .ivantage will be promoted through ni t-nsive
agriculi: -al research, extension, provisk- -, i i infrastructure. and market informat on and
facilit ,. cug access to land and. finiarice.
;:._uraI Poverty ReducAQn; An ov- rwhelniing majority of the poor in Gharc.-I  ve ni
the ru... areas and earn their living mainly fr'm farming. AgSSIP will contribute ! broad-
based, ?overty reduction by supporting te.nnological change and innovatior  .i crop,
livesto, .c, fishery and forestry production anc in agro-processing, thereby improvin. returns
to all icoduction factors, leading to increas£*A incomes. AgSSIP will be sensitivt, to the
needs i women, the youth and rural disadvantaged by devising special programs t., enable
these  7.toups to access improved technology and other resources to enhance their
productivity and incomes.
Gender Mainstreaming: Women play a significant role in Ghana's agriculture.
Yet despite the high proportion of women engaged in agricultural production, mf.rketing
and pa essing, women farmers' needs a.re generally ignored and services provided by
MOFA and other development partners ') . not give sufficient attention and focit- to the
partict-iA- problems women face in the agriculture sector. The participatory appru .-.h and
fine-thr i g of technical recommendations will create opportunities to involve the poorest
and c sr disadvantaged groups in decision making and help address the needs 61' these
farmer ' many of whom are women. Promc ion of appropriate technologies will f.ocus on
labour saving devices for women farmers so 4hat their farming and food processin; chores
would be minimised, saving them time for important home maldng activities. Inde d, rural
women who make up over 60 percent of the farming population and are often tL; major
provid .s of their families will particularly benefit. Increased incomes for won en will
improve household food security and well being, as women spend most on their earnings
on their families, especially on their children.
-119-



The curricula of agricultural colleges and institutes will be revised to reflect women
farmers' needs.  Technologies appropriate for enhancing women's productivity in
agriculture will be diffused by making agricultural extension services and their delivery
more gender sensitive through in-service training of extension staff, while at the same tine
devising measures aimed at encouraging End attracting female intake into agricultural
institutions. A database of gender disaggregated food and agricultural statistics, including
beneficiary assessment of agricultural services, will be developed to support gender
responsive planning.
e,ayironmental Sustainabilt. An environmental Impact Assessment (fHLA) of
AgSSlt' has been conducted to identify likely enviromnental problems associat 4 with
subprc i arns identified under the programme and recommend specific mitigation mieasures
to ens re that agricultural development proceeds without harming the environment.
Capacr y of district assembly staff will be enhanced to identity environmental proUlJms and
possib.e solutions and to mediate in their implementation at the local level and te mitigate
againsi any negative consequences. Environmental concems would be mainstrehmed in
MOFA activities and would become an integral part of the training at the agriultural
colleges and in technology diffusion programs. Ghana's plant and livestock protection
strateg:es emphasise the adoption of integrated pest management (IPM), a pest control and
management package that combines vanrous biological, chemical and crop rotation
techniques and seeks synergies in controlling pest populations. All extension manuals and
leaflets, would include guidelines on IPM, on the correct use of agro-chemicals to rnitigate
their: a ierse effects on the environment &'.d on how to conserve natural resources. taff of
agro-c . -ncal importers and distributors anc extension personnel would be trainer' on the
safe vi e of agrochemical and adherence t. mie Pesticides Management and Contro. Act of
1996.
Farmer-Based Organisations: SmaUlscale farmers face diseconomies ow' scale in
access-,.g input supply, credit and markets for their output. Because gettin.a fanners
organii .d tackles this problem as well as t unpowers them to bargain in the mar -et and
socio-political arena, where decisions affecting their welfare are taken, support would be
provid.-:d under AgSSIP to creating enabling conditions for development of farmer-based
organiPations (PBOs) on a sustainable basis. The main objective of the subprogranA is the
deepening and completion of policy and institutional reforms that would facilitate the
development of FBOs, and putting in place programs that would assist them to be market-
oriented and farmer-led.  The key elements that facilitate such development are
strenglhened institutions, particularly those of farmers' own movements such as the Ghana
Co-op,'ative Council and NGOs, that cater tor the training needs of FBOs staff, members
and trmstees through well-organised field liaining and education, and the availability of
adequwte promotional and advisory services. A Farner-Based Organisations Development
Fund v, c uld be established to promote and strengthen the development of FBOs.
Improved Governance, Financing an'i Donor Co-ordination: One of the -bjectives
of the Aecent reorganization and decentralizatlon of MOFA and public agricultural services
is to improve cost-effectiveness of the system. AgSSIP will complete the decentralization
process and provide the tools for and sharpen the skills of staff at the different `.vels to
impro" i: their output and performance. The co-ordination mechanism, which ivill be
-120-



instituted under AgSSIP, will improve supervision and monitoring. Use of fumds,
regardless of their source, will be more effective, transparent to all stakeholders, and
support the development objectives better. AgSSIlP would be implemented and managed by
existing institutions without creating a new programme implementation unit. All AgSSIP
compoients will be mainstreamed into the activities of the various departments and
directorates of MOFA and the National Agricultural Research System, managed uwl3er the
CouncI for Scientific and Industrial Rese Lrch. Overall programme co-ordination will be
the responsibility of the Policy, Planning. Monitoring and Evaluation Departmient of
MOFP   Govenment's medium-term expe-iditure framework (MTEF) aligns GOG and
donor ' rids with what is affordable and -allocates three-year rolling public exper, ii ures,
based :i policy priorities and achievement of desired objectives in a cost-effective nianner.
The iii ancing of AgSSIP is included in th: MTEF and GOG is committed to rjrovide
financi t! support to implement the programrn .
Ihe subsector-wide investment programme approach adopted under AgSSIP
require, good co-ordination of donor support and that all projects and programmes in the
subsector be incorporated under the same framework as far as possible and follow unified
procedures of accounting, monitoring -,id evaluation and reporting so that overlap,
duplica: ion and wastage of resources could be avoided. Such integration of projects and
harmc iu 1ation of procedures would also p, esume that different management units f xanced
by difih lnt donors would be eliminated mul the directorates or agencies respons ble for
implenmentation of programmes and pro> .ts would be unified. To this end, i.agoing
project. will be integrated into the AgSSIP framework to the extent possible. MOFA
would  ovide strong leadership to co-ordinate Ghana's development partners active .Ln the
agricu . -ire sector.
conclusion, the Government of Gh1.ia has formulated its accelerated agr',ultural
growt)- and development strategy, undertaker and will continue to undertake policy i-efomis
requir*. to promote growth and to reduce poverty.  It is however recognizted that
substar.. -al progress is needed to meet the challenges of the new millennium. It is ..lieved
that the implementation and adjustnent of the above measures will address the sector's
constraints and hence promote widespread growth and poverty reduction. Government also
believes that the proposed Agricultural Services Sub-Sector Investment Programme will
play an important role in facilitating the implernentation of these strategies and policy
reforms.

Annex 12: Summary of the Environmental Assessment
Ghana: Agricultural Services Subsector Investment Program
1.   A strategic environmental assessment (EA) of AgSSIP was conducted under the auspices
of the Ghana Environmental Protection Agency. The environmental impact of each program
activity was assessed against three sets of environmental parameters, i.e. ecological, natural
resources and socio-economic/health implications. On the whole, the impact matrix analysis
conducted concluded that AgSSIP would have minimum significant adverse impacts on the
environment or most of the adverse impacts that would result are ephemeral in nature.
2.   The major concern raised by the EA is that intensification of agricultural production
spurred by AgSSIP interventions will require the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides,
fungicides, herbicides, veterinary drugs and other chemicals. Where irrigation is practiced
residues of these chemicals can be washed into streams, rivers and lakes affecting domestic
animals, wild fauna and fisheries. These chemicals can also cause bodily harm if farmers are not
taught on their proper handling. Soil degradation may result in areas where pineapple production
is promoted and mono-cropping may lead to loss of biodiversity. Aquaculture development may
have adverse impact on water quality, noxious aquatic weeds may flourish, and animal and
human health may be affected by water-borne diseases.
3.   The EA made the following recommendations to ensure that the program interventions are
environmentally sustainable in the long-term. These are:
*  MOFA should develop a policy on the environment in order to mainstream environmental
considerations related to agriculture into its program activities at all levels;
 To ensure a smooth implementation of MOFA's environmental policy and internalization of
environmental issues in its operations, environmental desk officers should be appointed in
each of its directorates. These officers would liaise with EPA on environmental aspects of
their directorates' activities. EPA would provide orientation training for these officers;
*  MOFA should in collaboration with EPA develop environmental guidelines or simple
environmental manuals in specific areas (e.g. aquaculture, livestock, introduction of exotic
species, agro-chemical use, integrated pest management, agro-forestry, irrigation, etc.) in
order to guide field officers, especially at the district level;
X  In the training of agricultural officers and farmers, the environmental aspects of agricultural
programs and activities should be emphasized;
*  Model sustainable land use systems for different ecological zones should be developed based
on land capability;
*  It is expected that, under AgSSIP, agro-chemicals, especially pesticides, would increase
which may have serious adverse impacts on the environment and human health. The Plant
Protection and Regulatory Services Directorate (PPRSD) of MOFA and EPA's Chemicals
Control and Management Center should be equipped under AgSSIP to train extension
officers in the proper use of pesticides. Furthermore MOFA should assist with capacity
building in pesticides use in Ghana. This is essential for realization of AgSSIP objectives as
crop development would be export-oriented and there are strict regulations on chemical
residues crops, e.g. the European Union regulation, would come into force by July 2000.
*  MOFA should make commitments to prepare environmental impact assessment for some
program activities such as community-based tsetse control and aquaculture development.
*  AgSSIP has to take note of the country's potential vulnerability to climate change and
develop anticipatory adaptive strategies to offset its impacts. A drought management policy
should be developed through establishment of information systems on changing climate
conditions and patterns as a coping strategy.

4.   Assurances were obtained from MOFA that these recommendations would be implemented
in close collaboration with district, regional and national officers of the EPA. Environmental
concerns would be mainstreamed in MOFA activities and would become an integral part of the
training at the agricultural colleges and in technology diffusion programs. All extension manuals
and leaflets would include guidelines on how to conserve natural resources and the correct use of
agro-chemicals to mitigate their adverse effects on the environment. A strong component of
AgSSIP is strengthening the capacity of PPRSD through setting up new laboratories for testing
chemicals and rearing insects for bio-control and training staff on inspection of the activities of
agro-chemical importers and distributors. Environmental impact assessment would be prepared
for some program activities such as community-based tsetse control and aquaculture
development.
5.   Mitigating measures for these potential adverse impacts are built-in the AgSSIP. Many of
the technologies to be disseminated under AgSSIP for adoption by farmers will arrest land
degradation and promote soil and water conservation. The potential pollution caused by the use of
chemicals for intensification of agricultural production would be mitigated through the use of
integrated pest management (IPM) and training and demonstration of proper handling and safe
levels of chemical use, which is included in AgSSIP. As recommended by the EA, environmental
concerns would be mainstreamed in MOFA activities and would become an integral part of the
training at the agricultural colleges and in technology diffusion programs. All extension manuals
and leaflets would include guidelines on how to conserve natural resources and the correct use of
agro-chemicals to mitigate their adverse effects on the environment. A strong component of
AgSSIP is strengthening the capacity of the Plant Protection and Regulatory Services (PPRSD)
of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA), which is the secretariat to the national IPM
initiative, through setting up new laboratories for testing chemicals and rearing insects for bio-
control and training staff on inspection of the activities of agro-chemical importers and
distributors.
6.   AgSSIP interventions would not result in massive increase of agro-chemicals. Fertilizer
and pesticide use in Ghana is currently very low, averaging at less than 1,500 tons of pesticides
per year. At 4 kilograms per hectare, Ghana is among the lowest users of fertilizers in Sub-
Saharan Africa. Agrochemical use in crops other than cocoa and horticultural crops is restricted
to application of fertilizer and post harvest pest control. Ghana's plant and animal protection
strategies emphasize the adoption of IPM, a pest control and management package that combines
various biological, chemical and crop rotation techniques and seeks synergies in controlling pest
populations. There are sufficient skills, knowledge and experience in country to scale up the
methodologies packaged under IPM. It is possible to minimize pesticide misuse and abuse with
enhanced education and training targeted at entire population and applying effectively the checks
and balances provided for in existing legislation. As people become more aware of the dangers
and the alternatives to pesticides, including the third generation pesticides that are purely plant or
micro-organism based, dependence on and use of chemical pesticides would be minimized.
7.   Ghana legislated in 1996 the Pesticides Control and Management Act 528 to safeguard the
adverse effects of uncontrolled use of pesticides on the environment. The FAO guidelines on
pesticide use and management and international best practice were consulted in the preparation of
the Act. The Act requires registration of pesticides manufactured or imported into Ghana. It
confers on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and in accordance with the law that
established the Agency, the mandate to register and authorize pesticides and their dealers, classify
pesticides, and amend, ban or suspend their importation, manufacture or use.
8.   By the powers vested in it, the EPA has banned the use of seven pesticides in Ghana. The
use of other chemicals are also restricted. The Act requires that dealers in pesticides importation,
-123-



exportation, manufacture, distribution, advertising, trade and use should be licensed. Safeguards
for the use of pesticides and for persons who apply pesticides are also provided. The Act
establishes a Pesticides Technical Committee whose composition is broad and cover key public
and private organizations including civil society and whose function relate to the control and
management of pesticides in the country. Furthermore, the law empowers the EPA and the Plant
Protection and Regulatory Services Directorate (PPRSD) of MOFA to appoint at both the
national, regional and district assembly levels, pesticides inspectors wbose responsibilities
include the supervision and monitoring of pesticide use and management. Currently the PPRSD
has deployed 25 such inspectors at strategic stations in the country. At the regional level,
Regional Agricultural Development Officers have the additional responsibility as Regional
Coordinators for Pesticides Management to ensure enforcement and compliance with the Act and
monitoring and evaluation of pesticide use. These officers would also train subject matter
specialists, conduct seminars at agricultural colleges and organize workshops for private sector
personnel on the safe use of agro-chemicals and on adherence to the Act.
9.   Ghana's agricultural pest management strategy promotes the use of biological and
environmental control methods, reducing reliance on synthetic chemical pesticides.  The
country's regulatory framework and institutional capacity is adequate to promote and support
safe, effective and environmentally sound pest management. AgSSIP would further enhance this
capacity through providing facilities and logistical support for research, training and regulatory
services, including enforcement of the Pesticide Control and Management Act.
