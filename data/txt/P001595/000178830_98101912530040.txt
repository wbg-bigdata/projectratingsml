SHIRE VALLEY AGRICULTURAL DtVELOP1TENT PROJECT - PHASE II
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a second-phase Project for agricultural
development of the Lower Shire Valley in the Southern Region of Malawi.
It follows the pattern of Government strategy of developing agriculture
through broad-based integrated regional development programs. This would
be the fifth IDA credit for such development in Malawi. The other projects
are Credit 113-MAI (1968) for US$6 million for Lilongwe Agricultural Devel-
opment; Credit 114-MAI (1968) for US$3.7 million for Shire Valley Develop-
ment Phase I; Credit 244-MAI (May 1971) for US$7.25 million for the second
phase of Lilongwe Agricultural Development; and Credit 282-NAI for US$6.6
million for Karonga Rural Development, which was declared effective on
August 14, 1972. Progress on the existing agricultural projects has been
satisfactory and development in the Lower Shire Development Project - Phase
I will be completed on schedule with reduced costs and greater benefits than
projected at appraisal.
ii.       The Shire Valley Agricultural Development Project - Phase II would
comprise agricultural and fisheries development, accompanied by improvements
to health services, communications, and game conservation. The agricultural
component wqould provide improved extension services, seasonal and medium-term
credit and market facilities aimed at assisting 16,300 farmers not benefitting
under Phase I. The area of improved crops would be about 131,000 acres, in-
cluding 49,000 acres of cotton, 52,000 acres of maize, 19,000 acres of sorghum,
7,000 acres of rice, 4,000 acres of groundnuts, and 200 acres of cocoa. Beef
cattle production would be increased by around 1,800 head per annum and 1,000
fishermen would increase annual production by the equivalent of 1,400 tons of
smoke/dried fish. Staff housing, offices, workshops, and 108 miles of feeder
roads would be constructed and a railway bridge over the Shire River converted
for road as well as rail use. 82 miles of main and secondary roads would
also be improved. Rural water supply improvements involve drilling 140
boreholes. Health services would be increased by conversion and construction
of 4 primary health centers, 11 subcenters, and 16 health posts, together
with improvement of the service center at Chikwawa Hospital. Research into
irrigated and rainfed crops, pastures, and fish-farming would be instituted.
iii.      The Project would continue to be managed by the Project Mlanager
appointed for the Phase I project under the general direction of the Min-
istry of Agriculture and Natural Resources. A liaison committee would be
established to ensure coordination between the Project and other ministries
concerned.



- ii -
iv.       Total Project costs are estimated at US$13.5 million, to be
spread over five years. The proposed IDA credit of US$10.5 million would
finance 78% of Project costs, covering foreign exchange costs of US$6.8
million, and US$3.9 million of local currency costs. The balance of US$3.0
million local costs would be provided partly by Government in the amount of
US$1.7 million (12% of Project costs), and partly from the Agricultural
Development and Marketing Corporation in the amount of US$1.3 million (10%
of Proiect costs).
v.        Goods and services to be procured by international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines would have a total value of
US$3.7 million. Housing and building contracts amounting to US$2.3 million
would be subject to local competitive bidding, since construction sites
would be widespread. Remaining civil works would be undertaken by force
account because of their dispersed nature.
vi.       At full development, the annual value of increased production of
crops, livestock, and fish would be around US$4.7 million. Based on the Bank's
Economics Department's price forecasts for the crops involved and local prices
for fish and livestock, the economic rate of return is estimated to be 22%.
A 10% increase in costs accompanied by a 10% reduction in revenues gives a
rate of return of 14%.
vii.      Average annual net cash incomes of participating farm families
would increase from about US$11 to between US$95 and US$120 per annum. On
a per capita basis it is estimated that the income of Proiect beneficiaries
including cash income and the value of subsistence production, would more
than double from US$15 to US$34 at full development. Since Malawi's per
capita GDP in 1971 was estimated at about US$84, and its per capita rural
income at about US$50, it would appear that the Project would benefit pri-
marily the poorer part of Malawi's population.
viii.     With appropriate assurances, the Project would be suitable for an
IDA credit of US$10.5 million.

SH1IRE VALLEY AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - PHASE II
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of l4alawi has requested IDA assistance in continu-
ing agricultural development of the Shire Valley. Government's original
request for US$16.7 million comprising a production oriented rural develop-
ment project included among other important items an agro-industry and a
substantial road development program. During appraisal it was agreed with
Government that because of limited financial resources and because the
agro-industry component and much of the roads were not at this stage an in-
tegral part of the Shire Valley development, the Project would accordingly
be revised.
1.02      To date, IDA has financed four agricultural projects in Malawi:
the Lilongwe Agricultural Development Project (US$6 million in 1968); and
a further US$7.25 million in 1971 for the second phase of that project;
and Shire Valley Development Project - Phase I (US$3.7 million in 1968);
and US$6.6 million for the Karonga Rural Development Project, which became
effective on August 14, 1972. Progress on existing agricultural projects has
been satisfactory and development in the Lower Shire Development Project -
Phase I will be completed on schedule (paras. 3.04 and 3.05).
1.03      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission to
Malawi in June 1972, consisting of Messrs. A. Storrar, J. Bevan, H. Cooke,
S. Hayden and D. Lomax (IDA); and G. Gerhardsen and R. Henderson (consultants).
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Malawi is a land-locked country of about 46,000 sq mi - including
lakes - with a land area of approximately 36,000 sq mi. Its population is
estimated at 4.6 million and is growing at about 2.5% per year: average
population density is 128 per sq mi. Agriculture accounts for just over
50% of GDP (at factor cost), which has grown at a rate of 5.9% annually
during the period 1964-71. Per capita GDP in 1971 was estimated at K 70
(US$84).



- 2 -
B. Agricultural Sector
2.02      It is estimated that approximately 750,000 farmers and their
dependents derive their income from smnall-scale agriculture. Agriculture
accounts for over 90% of total exports3, which in 1971 amounted to K 49
million (UJS$59 million). During the period 1964-71, the value of exports
from small farmers increased from K 12 million (US$14.4 million) to K 23.5
million (US$28.2 million); exports from estates over the same period in-
creased from K 10 million (US$12 million) to K 22.4 million (US$26.9 mil-
lion). For details see Annex 1.
Farming Background of Malawi
2.03      Only a small proportion of the land in Malawi is held in freehold
or leasehold tenure and this is almost all in the hands of tea, tobacco, or
sugar estate owners; the balance is held in customary tenure and is allocated
traditionally. Individual rights to cultivate are granted under customary
laws, which remain undisturbed while cultivation continues; failure to cul-
tivate any part of a holding results in the land being reallocated. Security
of tenure is, however, government policy and appropriate legislation for the
granting of land titles has been enacted. The land registration process has
commenced on the IDA-financed Lilongwe Project.
2.04      Land is cultivated mainly by hand and an average family can farm
between four and eight acres. In the Central and Northern Regions, however,
holdings are larger and oxen are increasingly used for power. The staple
foods are maize, rice, and cassava and the country is self-supporting in
cereals.
2.05      Relatively few people own cattle and numbers are small in propor-
tion to the population. Progress is now being made, however, in developing
farmers' interest in the productive potential of livestock as a regular
source of cash income. For the people living in the river and lake areas,
fishing is becoming an increasingly important source of food and income.
Agricultural Strategy
'2.06     The development strategy in Malawi aims at encouraging the small
farmer to work more efficiently and productively. To this end Government
intends to provide:
(a) a fair and efficient marketing service for all crops;
(b) inputs at the lowest possible prices within easy reach
of the farm;
(c) credit for the farmer so that he can purchase seasonal
and medium-term inputs; and



-3-
(d) a well-trained extension service, giving practical
and economically sound advice based on the latest
research findings.
Over the next five to ten years, Government intends to increase the produc-
tion of cash crops, particularly tobacco, cotton, and groundnuts, and thus
raise farmers' cash incomes, which are among the lowest in Africa.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
A. General
Location
3.01      The Project covers some 2,000 sq mi of the southern portion of
the Shire Valley.  The Valley is virtually an isolated geographic unit and
is located in the southwestern corner of Malawi, about 200 ft above sea
level. It is bounded by escarpments to the east and west and is bisected
by the Shire River, which originates in Lake Malawi about 100 miles to the
northeast (see maps).
Climate, Soils, and Water Suply-
3.02      The Valley has marked wet and dry seasons of about six months
each, and the annual rainfall averages 28 inches (Annex 1). Temperatures
are highest in October/November prior to the onset of the rains and lowest
during the period June/July. The soils on the escarpments are generally
poor and unsuitable for crops but those in the valley, predominantly crack-
ing clays and alluvials, can support sustained cropping both under rainfed
and irrigated conditions. There is ample surface water and, throughout the
valley, there is a good supply of subsurface water.
Population and Land Tenure
3.03      The 300,000 people living in the Shire Valley represent 6% of
Malawi's population, and which gives an overall populatior density of about
120 persons per sq mi, but as the majority of people live on the valley
bottom the density is 400 per sq mi; each family having available about 9
acres of agricultural land. The land is now held under customary tenure
and inheritance is patrilineal.
Phase I Development
3.04      The development of the Shire Valley has been neglected primarily
for climatic and health reasons. It has suffered from a marked absence of
basic infrastructure. Government recognizing this has, since the mid-1960's,
given the Valley and its problems developmental priority. In 1968 an ap-
plication was submitted to IDA which led to assistance in the financing of



-4.
a US$4.6 million project aimed at increasing crop production on about
130,000 ac of farmland in the Shire Valley, and which also provided the
essential infrastructure needed for this development. The five-year proj-
ect included agricultural extension, provision of credit to farmers, con-
scruction of 156 boreholes, 7 markets, 160 miles of crop extraction roads
and improvement to 24 miles of existing road. The principal aim of the
project was to increase production of cotton by improved cultural methods
from 4,000 to 17,000 sh ton by 1973 and the number of growers using improved
methods from 200 to 4,000 over the same period. Progress to date is sum-
marized below.

3.05      Physical execution is ahead of schedule and development costs lower
than estimated.  With the approval of IDA, surplus funds have been used for
improvement of health services within the Shire Valley. The project has been
well managed. However, the development has been confined to the immediate
neighbourhood of Ngabu (see map) and the impact elsewhere in the Valley has
been minimal. It is also apparent that the scope of future development should
be expanded to include other infrastructure. On the completion of Phase I
development, sufficient staff and facilities would be retained to continue
at the level already established. Phase I participants would also benefit
to a limited extent from some of the facilities being provided under Phase II.
The present position is discussed below.
Commun cations
3.06      Communications in the Valley are difficult.  It is accessible from
the north by two tortuous and poorly surfaced roads that descend into the
valley. All roads in the valley are affected by floods and are frequently
closed during the rains. The main Malawi Railway outlet to Beira in Mozambique,
Rhodesia, and South Africa passes through the lower part of the valley and
provides the most reliable means of transporting produce to and from the
project area; the railway also connects in the north with the newly completed
Blantyre/Nacala Railway line (the northern Mozambique Indian Ocean port).



There is one road bridge across the Shire River in the north and a ferry
close to the rail bridge in the center; during high floods, however, the
ferry service is liable to £iuspension. Although the river is navigable for
most of the year, it is not used commercially. There is an airstrip at
Sucoma suitable for light executive and crop-spraying aircraft. Ngabu
headquarters has a telephone link to Blantyre and, within the Project area,
radio transmitter receivers are used successfully by project staff.
Marketing
3.07      Marketing of produce and the supply of farm inputs are the res-
ponsibility of the Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation
(ADMARC), a parastatal body wholly owned by government (previously the
Farmers Mlarketing Board). These services are provided through permanent
and temporary markets, the location and numbers of which are insufficient
to meet trhe needs of increased production.
Cropping Patterns, Credit and Extension Services
3.08      Traditional farmers in the Shire Valley live at a subsistence
level although some farmers supplement their livelihood witn fishing. The
m-in subsisternce crops are maize, sorghum, millet, and rice, hand cultivated
with the whole family participating at times of peak labor requirements.
Improved agricultural practices are not widely used other than by those
farmers affected under the Phase I project. Crop yields are generally low,
averaging about 300 lb/acre of seed cotton and 600 lbs/acre for cereal crops.
3.09      Agricultural credit is not universally available to farmers and
has, in the past, been provided only to those participating in the major de-
velopment projects. As a result some 5,000 farmers only have been able to
benefit from the Phase I project. Credit repayment has been good, 98% of
all loans so far made having been recovered with the annual volume of lend-
ing having increased from K42,000 in 1969 to K227,000 in the last season.
3.10      The levels of extension staff, in those areas outside the Phase I
project area, are low and insufficient to meet the needs of a development
program.
Fisheries
3.11      Fishing in the valley is mainly flood plain and swamp fishing and
depends entirely on the flow of water in the Shire River and, to some extent,
its tributary, the Ruo River. The 2,400 existing fishermen usually operate
one kind of gear on an intermittent basis using a dugout canoe, but due to
the scarcity of large trees replacements are not easily obtainable. About
70% of the fish produced is consumed locally, with 20% of the balance being
sold fresh and 80% smoked. Poor communications restrict access by buyers to
the fishing grounds and research facilities are limited.



-6-
Agricultural and Fisheries Research and Farmer Training
3.12      Agricultural research is served by three stations in the valley -
Makanga, Ngabu and Kasinthula (see Map). Fisheries research is centered in
Chiromo. Fertilizer and variety trials on commonly grown irrigated and
rainfed crops are carried out at Makanga, whereas Ngabu has developed a small
rainfed crop program similar to that of Makanga but on a differing soil type.
Kasinthula was recently developed under an FAO program as an irrigation sta-
tion and pilot farm. Training is undertaken for farmers at the Ngabu station
and for fishermen at Nchacha on Lake Malawi.
Wildlife
3.13      There are three areas reserved for wildlife -- the Lengwe National
Park (50 sq ml), the Majete Game Reserve (230 sq mi) and the Mwabvi Game
Reserve (60 sq mi). The Lengwe Park was proclaimed in 1927 for the pro-
tection of the Nyala antelope; the others, were more recently established
to preserve diminishing numbers of rhinocerous, buffalo, elephant and
different species of antelope. Existing facilities prevent adequate patrol-
ling to control the activities of poachers.
Health Situation
3.14      Tuberculosis is more prevalent and the incidence of malaria and
bilharzia is higher than elsewhere in Malawi.  It has been estimated that a
large proportion of the population is in some state of nutritional imbalance
and kwashiorkor cases are regularly reported.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      The Project, over five years, would provide integrated rural develop-
ment within the Shire Valley in an area adjacent to that of Phase I. Emphasis
would be given to increasing crop yields, livestock and fishery production.
It would increase the number of improved farmers by 16,300 (Annex 2 Table 1)
and improved fishermen by 1,000, none of whom would have been affected by
Phase I. The development would comprise; extension and training services,
credit, markets, roads and water supplies. Provision would also be made for
improvement of health services, preservation of wildlife, research programs
and the preparation for a system of land registration.
B. Detailed Features
Agricultural Development
4.02      The principal aim of the Project is to increase crop production
on 16,300 family farms. All these farms presently grow maize, and, depend-
ent on soil type, other crops such as cotton, sorghum, rice and groundnuts



- 7 -
included in a cropping pattern. Increased production would be achieved by the
provision of seasonal and medium term credit for such items as improved seed,
fertilizer and implements and the intensification of farmer training and
extension services. Details of the crop improvement program and typical
cropping combinations are shown in Annex 2 Tables 1 to 6.
Livestock
4.03      The Project would establish a livestock section headed by a senior
livestock officer with supporting staff. Two grazing schemes would be estab-
lished and developed in selected areas within the 200,000 acres of available
grazing land. To open unused grazing areas and improve animal husbandry,
fire lines, tracks, dipping tanks, and 38 weirs and dams would be constructed.
Numbers and grazing of stock would be controlled through branding. During
summer cattle would graze in the hills and in the winter and dry season on
the aftermath of crops and associated grassland in the valley floor. Three
centers for training oxen for sale to farmers would also be established. For
further details see Annex 3.
Fisheries
4.04      The Project would increase the level of extension activity to
raise the productivity of some 1,000 fishermen, or 40% of the 2,400 who
derive the major part of their livelihood from fishing in the rivers and
marshes of the Shire Valley. Extension staff would introduce new fishing
gear, and, through the Department of Fisheries, assist trained boat builders
in constructing simple boatyards capable of producing about 225 boats during
the Project period. In addition, 50 improved smoke-drying kilns would be
built for demonstration purposes and 20 miles of all-weather access roads
would be constructed to aid supervision and facilitate marketing. Since
the existing potential maximum offtake from the rivers and marshes may
well have been reached by Year 5 of the Project, facilities would be pro-
vided for fish culture trials at the Kasinthula Research Station (para 4.16)
and for engineering studies in the Elephant and Ndinde Marshes, where it may
be feasible to establish controlled lagoons for intensive low-cost fish
farming. For further details see Annex 4.

4.05      Increased production would be principally brought about by the
provision of a high concentration of extension staff to improve agricultural
methods through farm visits, demonstrations, and the use of mass media tech-
ques, such as the radio, mobile film units, and field days.
4.06      To assist the Project Manager and his deputy in carrying out the
program, headquarters staff would include five senior and 16 professional
and technical officers (with diplomas from Bunda College). At the middle
and lower levels of field extension there would be technical officers,
technical assistants, and demonstrators. The technical assistants would be
mainly concerned with crop and livestock development and farmer training



- 8 -
and their number would be built up to ensure that by the end of the develop-
ment period the ratio of extension staff to farming families would be of the
order of 1:400. During the initial stages of development, technical assist-
ants would be complemented by credit assistants and demonstrators so that
there would be one field worker to approximately 100 participating farmers;
this concentration of staff would provide the necessary impetus for rapid
crop improvement.
4.07      Six area headquarters, comprising offices, stores and training
facilities would be established to administer field extension and training
services and the training center at Ngabu project headquarters would be
expanded to provide residential quarters for farmers undergoing training.
An experienced senior training officer would be appointed to coordinate and
organize staff and farmer training.
4.08      Existing headquarters offices, workshops and stores would be ex-
panded under the Project. The necessary vehicles and training equipment
would be provided. Staff housing required in addition to that already
available in the valley, either from existing Government or Phase I sources,
would be constructed.
Credit
4.09      Incremental credit would be provided to cover the purchase of sea-
sonal inputs such as insecticides, fertilizers, and seeds and medium-term
credit for such items as cotton sprayers, fishing boats, and work oxen.
Revolving funds, within the Project organization, would be set up to handle
the proceeds and farmer requirements would be made available in kind. The
revolving fund for seasonal credit would reach a peak of about K 1.13 million
(US$ 1.36 million) in year 5 of the Project while a similar fund for medium
term credit would peak at about K 0.68 million (US$0.82 million) in the same
year. For details see Annex 5.
Markets
4.10      ADMARC would continue to purchase all crops marketed in the Project
area (as elsewhere in the Valley), but has only limited primary facilities
for crop purchase and distribution of inputs and these would be extended to
cater for the incremental production expected. 17 new markets would be built
and three existing markets improved between 1973 and 1976 at an estimated
total capital cost to ADMARC of approximately K 334,000 (US$400,000). For
details of ADMARC see Annex 6. The existing auction sale rings run by
the Veterinary Department for cattle marketing, are considered sufficient
for Project needs. Fish products would continue to be marketed through
private traders.
Roads
4.11      The Project would finance construction of a network of roads
(Annex 7) to meet the basic requirement of the proposed agriculture
and fishery development. 82 miles of main and secondary roads would be im-
proved by constructing culverts and bridges, and the railway bridge at Bangula



-9
would be adapted to handle road vehicles. Engineering studies and supervision
of construction of structures would be by consultants. The Ministry of Works
and Supplies (MOWS), Roads Department, would be responsible for the technical
supervision of the consultants. A road construction unit consisting of motor-
graders, heavy bulldozer, and ancillary road equipment would be purchased and
operated under the control of Project staff for construction of embankments
on the main and secondary roads as well as for construction of 108 miles of
feeder roads. This equipment would also be used in the land reorganization
program (para 4.17), and for the construction of fishing canoe access canals.
The maintenance of main and secondary roads is the responsibility of the MOWS
but feeder roads would be maintained by the Project Manager with the assis-
tance of a works supervisor. Consultants would also be employed to carry
out engineering studies for upgrading the Chikwawa-Bangula road. During
negotiations assurances were obtained that the consultants and their terms
of reference would he mutually acceptable to Government and IDA.
Water Supplies
4.12      To provide an adequate supply of water for domestic use, crop
spraying and livestock watering, 140 boreholes would be drilled in the Project
area during the five-year development period.  Each borehole would be fitted
with a hand pump, and a trough would be installed about 40 ft distant for the
watering of cattle (see also Annex 8).
Health Services
4.13      In line with Malawi's 15-year health program, based upon a World
Health Organization report on health problems in Malawi, additional services
(mainlv preventive) would be provided to bring the level of services in the
Project area to that of the rest of the country. Four Pri.ary health centers,
11 subcenters, and 16 health posts would be built and staffed. A new service
center for Chikwawa hospital would also be constructed. Suitable equipment
and the necessary drugs would be made available for each health unit; in addi-
tion, insecticides and molluscicides would be used to help combat malaria and
bilharzia. During negotiations assurances were obtained that the Ministry of
Health would make available the staff and materials required for the efficient
running of health services in the Project area. For further details see Annex 9.
Wildlife
4.14      The Game Parks in the Project area would continue to be reserved
for wildlife. In order to preserve the rare Nyala antelope and other species
of game, facilities to control poaching would be improved in the Lengwe Park
by the provision of 10 houses for resident game control staff, the construc-
tion of access roads and tracks and the purchase of one vehicle. For details
see Annex 10.
Research
4.15      The existing research staff in agricultural stations at Makanga,
Kasinthula and Ngabu and at the fisheries station at Chiromo would be
strengthened by appointing an experienced senior research officer who would



- 10 -
coordinate agricultural and fisheries research. He would be responsible to
the Chief Research Officer of the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources
MANR for the program in the Valley relating to cotton, other rainfed crops and
seed bulking. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that Government
would appoint to the post of Senior Research Officer a suitably qualified and
experienced person and that it would consult with IDA prior to his appointment.
Additional housing, offices and two laboratories would be built and equipped
to accommodate additional staff (four professional officers and ancillary staff)
4.16      Provision would also be made for a program of research for irrigated
| rice, cocoa, soils and land reorganization problems. Rainfed crop trials
\ would be centered at Ngabu, irrigation trials at Kasinthula, and seed bulking
would be confined to Makanga. For further details see Annex 11. The seed
bulking and rainfed crop trials are important for maintaining crop production
and the irrigation research program is essential to provide basic information
on potential crops, water utilization techniques, and cropping systems for
future irrigation development.
Land Registration for Project Farmers
4.17      Existing land laws provide the processes by which title may be
granted to those holding land under customary tenure. Project farmers,
following the experience gained on the Lilongwe Project, would be encouraged
to apply for title and the Project would provide the necessary staff and
equipment to prepare for the application of the legislation.
Environment
4.18      Farm incomes are very low and cannot bear a crop loss from serious
pest infestation; consequently, the cotton crop will be sprayed with increas-
ing amounts of DDT and other insecticides. The research program would, how-
ever, carry out investigations into less persistent chemicals and these would
be substituted if found economical and effective. Under the ?roject, monitor-
ing arrangements to measure toxicity levels in fish would continue and existing
facilities would be augmented.
Monitoring of Progress
4.19      The Project Manager would continue to be responsible for the
monitoring of progress of the Project. This has not been entirely satis-
factory in the past and provision would be made for staffing of an evalua-
tion unit to collect the necessary information including farm incomes and
related data.

5.02      Cost estimates are based upon the exnerience gained over the past
three years in the Phase I project and have been adjusted for recent price
developments. The estimates include cumulative price contingencies of 5%
annually on both local and foreign exchange costs and a physical contingency
of 5% on all Project investment items. All costs are net of taxes.
5.03      Prolect cost elements, by function, are summarized in the following

11.26         13.50       100.0
B. Proposed Financing
5.04      The Project would be financed as follows:
K             US$         %
(million)      (million)
Government of Malawi                 1.4            1.7         12
ADMARC                               1.1            1.3         10
IDA                                  8.3           1n.5         78
11.3           13.5        100
The proposed IDA credit of US$10.5 million (K 8.8 million) would finance 78%
of Project costs, with US$6.8 million (65% of the Credit) covering the estimated
foreign exchange costs and the balance of US$3.7 million (35% of the Credit)
financing about half of local currency costs. US$1.3 million (10% of Project
costs) would be provided by ADMARC to finance the cost of markets and 60% of
seasonal credit. The execution of a finance agreement between Government and
ADMARC, acceptable to IDA, would be a condition of Credit effectiveness.
The remaining 12%o of Project costs (US$1.7 million) would be financed by
Government.



- 13 -
C. Procurement
5.05      Procurement of vehicles, machinery, equipment, and fertilizers,
amounting to about US$2.7 million in value, would be by international com-
petitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines. To facilitate this
procedure, bulk orders for the items concerned would be prepared annually.
All farm inputs procured by international competitive bidding would be
handled through ADMARC, which follows procedures satisfactory to IDA. Con-
sultants for the detailed road engineering of the Chikwawa-Bangula road, and
for the bridges and structures for the remainder of the program would be
selected from a list of international firms to be agreed between the
Government and IDA (US$0.5 million). Staff housing and building construction
works, estimated at about US$2.3 million, would be too wide'Ly dispersed and
small to attract international bidding and competitive tenders would there-
fore be invited from local firms 1/. Purchase of the administration and
maintenance equipment (desks, typewriters, etc.) would be subject to local
competitive bidding in accordance with existing Government tender procedures.
All tenders would be processed by the Malawi Government Central Tender Board,
whose procedures are acceptable to IDA. Boreholes (US$0.3 million) would be
constructed by the Water Development Department under force account and earth-
works on the main and secondary roads and construction of feeder roads (US$0.4
million) would be done with Project equipment. Construction work to adapt
the railway bridge (US$0.5 million) would be done by Malawi Railways, which
would call for international competitive bidding. Drifts and culverts
(US$0.3 million) would also be constructed by local firms, after competi-
tive bidding, under the supervision of the Ministry of Works. Medical
drugs and other small items costing less than US$2,000 would continue to be
purchased by the Chief Medical Officer and Project Manager, respectively, on
the basis of quotations from local suppliers. Assurances that these pro-
curement procedures would be followed were obtained during negotiations.
Assurances were also obtained that draft tender documents for all contracts
exceeding US$25,000 would be submitted to IDA for approval before invita-
tions were issued, and that bid analyses and recommendations for award
would be sent to IDA for comment before award.
D. Disbursement
5.06      Disbursements from the Credit would finance 78% of total Project
expenditures. Reimbursement of expenditures for seasonal credit as well
as the expenditures for the construction works to be performed under
force account would be made against certificates of expenditure, the
supporting documentation for which would not be submitted for review, but
would be retained by the Borrower and made available for inspection by the
1/   Local firms include international firms based in Malawi.



- 14 -
Association during the course of a Project supervision mission. The certifi-
cates of expenditure would be signed by the Project Manager and the Financial
Controller. The expenditures of costs for markets will not be eligible for
financing from the credit.
E. Accounts and Audit
5.07      During the life of the Project, accounts would be maintained at
Project Headquarters at Ngabu, with separate accounts identified for credit
fund operations. Phase I accounts have been audited by the Auditor-General.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that accounts would continue
to be audited by an independent auditor satisfactory to IDA and that accounts
would be submitted to the Association no later than six months after the
close of the Project's financial year.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Project Administration
6.01      The Project would be a direct continuation of Phase I, and the
Project Manager would remain responsible to the Permanent Secretary MANR.
The Permanent Secretary would chair a liaison committee established to en-
sure coordination between Project staff and other Ministries and organiza-
tions concerned. A staff, consisting of an experienced Project Manager as
well as 11 professional and technical officers and 51 technical assistants,
is already In post und'er 'PliaseZ Iand Wbuld provide a sound basis on which
to build to the number required for the Project.  The Project would be ad-
ministered from the present headquarters at Ngabu in the center of the Val-
ley.  AetEou"gifsome  taff time would bspent on Phase I participants the
main staff emphasis would be on Phase II. Assurances were obtained that the
person appointed as Project Manager would be mutually acceptable to the
Government and IDA. Project organization is set out in the Chart.
6.02      The Project Manager and his deputy would spend the greater part of
their time on Project activities but would also remain responsible forthe
administration of Phase I.  In construciT if o'"''health facilities, Project
f5idi7~ia&iaIJilife facilIties, the Project Manager would have the respon-
sibility for implementing the physical program, after which any necessary
direction would be provided by representatives of the Ministries of Health,
Works and Supply, and Agriculture and Natural Resources respectively. The
Project Manager would also have responsibility for 1RpI.=enting programs
relat4ng to training  extension, credit  rJeRearch, land planning i4iid_g-
istration; each of these activities wou:!d be headed by a suitably qualified
senior officer reporting directly to him.



- 15 -
6.03      Each area headquarter would be headed by a senior technical officer
(under the direction of the senior extension officer) assisted by a trainee
technical officer; the latter would be responsible for supervising one
technical assistant, one credit technical assistant, and a demonstrator
located at each ADMARC market. No difficulty is anticipated in recruiting
the staff required.
B. Credit Administration and Recording
6.04      Farmers or fishermen requiring credit would have their applications
approved by area extension and credit officers and all  a,s2on a  cre ditKPuld
be sWEzliedin  xind.-through,_ADMARC market,_,ggt,neM,at which individual farmers
ould be registe.ere.  Under the Phase I project a system has been developed
whereby brrower.s are obliged to sell their produce to the market at which
ty ares-   ¢_re isteraZ                repayments; r              s4e; to credit
assisttats.  Fishe    r e           s would be collected by credit assistants
based at beaches.  These repayments would then be paid into a revolving fund
at Project headquarters where detailed records would be maintained (Annex 5).
Although there are alternative outlets for crop sales through local traders,
it is not expected that these outlets would be used as each participating
farmer is required ;orepaybis+ 4p,n prior to ret .credt.
During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government that the
present credit system would continue to be operated.
6.05      Farmers seasonal inputs would be supplied to Project farmers at a
selling price equal to landed cost (including handling, transportation, and
other direct charges). A credit charge of 10% 1/, the present seasonal credit
charge in Malawi, would be added to the value of goods to cover credit admin-
istration. Security for seasonal credit would be the farmer's crop from
which ravments are deduc, ed. '%edTi term credit would carry an annual in-
terest rate of 10% repayment periods would vary from two to three years de-
pendant upon the item supplied. Assurances were obtained that the seasonal
credit charge of 10% would be continued and that the medium-term credit in-
terest rate would be 10% annually on the outstanding balance of the loan and
that IDA would be consulted prior to any changes.
6.06      At present, cotton sprayers are subject to a 50% price subsidy.  This
subsidy was introduced to encourage their use in the absence of readily avail-
able credit. However, now that medium-term credit would be available to
farmers, Government has indicated that it intends to phase out the subsidy
over a reasonable period.
1/   For a 10-month seasonal loan this is equivalent to a 12% per annum rate
of interest.

VII. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, PRICES, AND FARMERS'
AND GOVERNMENT'S COSTS AND BENEFITS
A. Production
Crops
7.01      The average yields obtained from unimproved farmers and those
projected for improved farmers at full development in lb/acre are as
follows:
Seed Cotton   Maizre  Sorghum   Rice   Groundnuts   Cocoa
(shelled)
Unimproved         300          600     600       300       400         -
Improved           900       1,800      800    2,000        800       1,500
7.02      Estimated maize yields assume early slantin fsythetic  aeties
and the application of fertilizer, while the smaller increases in sorghum and
groundnut yields are based on the use of better seed alone. The estimated
maize yields_are already being obtained by a few farmers and are suD orted
by experimental results in field tria,lich reach levels of 2,400 lb/acre.
The low rice yields obtained by unimproved farmers would be increased sub-
stantially by adopting better cultural practices on river outflows and swamp
edges and using better seed and fertilizers; some progressive farmers in the
Project area, by the adoption of these practises, have already exceeded these
yield projections. The cocoa yield estimates are derived from experimental
crops.
7.03      The number of farmers adopting improved practices as a result of
tPie Project is expected to increase by approximately 3,000 per annum from
the present number of 9,600. All farmers would not grow the full range of
crops, but would adopt one of three main farming patterns. Total incremental
production of crops by Year 5 of the project is estimated as follows:
Cotton    Maize    Sorghum /    Rice    Groundnuts    Cocoa
---------------------short tons-rounded---------------------
1978      18,400   33,022       935      5,460         150         4q12
/1   Overall production decreased as acreage reduced but planted to other
crops.
12   Rising to a peak of 150 sh tons per annum by Year 8.
This increased production would come primarily from increased yields and
Partly from a changing cropping pattern, whereby cotton acreage would be
substantially increased at the expense of sorghum. For details see Annex 2.



- 17 -
Fisheries
7.04      The Project is estimated to increase annual catches by the equiv-
alent of 1,400 sh tons of smoke-dried fish from an existing level of 3,300
sh tons. This will be brought about by some 1,000 existing fishermen improv-
ing their fishing techniques and by the provision of better marketing con-
ditions. Individual catches are expected to increase from 3.4 tons wetfish
to 6.7 tons annually. See Annex 4.
Livestock
7.05      With the overall improvement in cattle management expected it is
estimated that the annual offtake of beef animals for sale would increase
from the present level of 10% (1,250 head) to an estimated 15% (4*000 head).
At the same time the carcass size would be increased by 13%, to 350 lb. See
Annex 3.
B. Marketing and Prices
7.06      Seed cotton produced on the Project would be ginned locally.  The
The lint cotton would be exported and the cottonseed would be crushed within
Malawi. The cottonseed oil would be used internally as a substitute for
presently imported vegetable oil. Other export products include groundnuts
(to European markets) and rice (to South Africa). Fish would also be ex-
ported, principally to Rhodesia. The maize and beef produced on the Project
would be consumed within the country. No marketing problems are anticipated.
7.07      Prices for products in export markets are projected by the Bank's
Economics Department for 1974 and 1980 at 1972 currency values (Annex 15).
Costs incurred in shipping to export markets were deducted from these project-
ed prices to estimate f.o.b. prices. Farm gate prices for crops used are the
same as those paid by ADMARC in 1972 and reflect reasonable marketing margins,
including ADMARC profits in relation to projected f.o.b. prices.

C. Benefits to Farmers/Fishermen
7.09      Typical farm budgets for Project farmers engaged in the various
Project activities are shown in Annex 2. Additional labor for farm operations
is available within the scheme. The budgets indicate that: a cotton/maize/
rice farmer would have a net cash income of K 116 (US$139) giving an increased
annual cash benefit of K 104 (US$125); and a maize/sorghum/rice/groundnuts
farmer would increase his net income to K 77 (US$92). The net cash income
figures are additional to subsistence requirements of the farming family.
Fishermen's Benefits
7.1n      A typical budget for an improved fisherman is shown in Annex 2, and
indicates that a Project participant would increase his annual net income to
ahout K 595 (US$714), giving an increased cash benefit of K 356 (US$427).
D. Costs to Government
7.11      The cash flow for Government, as presented in Annex 16, shows that,
as a result of expenditure on the Project, there would be a cumulative deficit
of K 1.5 million AU$8LLJ  n) at the end of 20 years and a deficit of
K 8.2 million (US$9.8 million) at h'e---fnd    Elie- Arepayment period.  During



- 19 -
the Project development period, the cumulative deficit would build up to
K 453,000 (US$54,0)after which the annual def              qdS  o     cont lB e
about K 125,000 (US$150,000), rising  o       O 000 (US$220,221 annuallv in
Years 11 through 5                     is expected that Project participants
would no longer require credit, and repayment of the credit funds to Govern-
ment has been taken into account. While the farm income is not subject to
income tax, farmers would contribute to Government revenue through indirect
sale_s taxes, which, for Malawi in 1971, wereapproximartly2_%6. of estimated
iva                               -&-'cash flow has assumed an overall return
to Government of 10f of increased cash benefits for such taxes as Project
participants expenditure pattern would not include a high proportion of
luxury items.
7.12      The final deficit can be attributed to social expenditures included
in the Project all of wqhich are normally borne by Government. These include
costs of wildlife preservation, land registration, water supplies, part of
road construction and health services. However, additional revenue would
accrue to Government from increased road user taxes which has not been taken
into account.
VIII. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      The main quantified benefits from the proposed Project would be
increased production of cotton, maize, rice, confectionary groundnuts, cocoa,
beef, and fish in a traditionally subsistence agriculture sector by about
16,300 farmers and 1000 fishermen. Other less quantitiable benefits would be
improved health facilities, the provision of domestic water supplies, and
benefits to road users not directly involved in Project production.
8.02      In calculating the rate of return to the economy, family labor was
costed at zero, as there is no opportunity of alternative employment. Hired
labor for rice production required at seasonal peaks is costed at the local
minimum wage of K 0.23 per man-day as well as in the fishermen's budgets,
(Annex 2).
8.03      On the basis of cost estimates, yields given (in paragraphs 7.01,
7.04, and 7.05,) and the average commodity prices assumed (in paragraphs 7.07)
to 7.12) and applied over 20 years, the rate of return to the economy from in-
vestment in the Project would be about 22%, even if the costs of related
health services are included. The rate of return including the cost of
incremental family labor at the minimum daily rate is 20%.
8.04      The overall rate of return was tested for sensitivity at various
cost and benefit levels. The return is more sensitive to variations in
cotton and maize revenues since these commodities account for the major
share of Project benefits. A 10% increase in costs, accompanied by a 10%
decrease in benefit, would give a rate of return of about 13.8%. On the
assumption that the Project achieved only 75% of the "improved farmer" target



- 20 -
of 16,300 with related affects on costs and benefits during the five-year
period 1973-1978 the rate of return falls to around 15%. Sensitivity to
changes in Project estimates is summarized in Annex 14.
8.05      During the five-year development period, foreign exchange costs
exceed benefits by approximately US$0.9 million; at full crop development
from Year 6 onwards, however, net foreign exchange benefits run at Just
below US$2.0 million per annum. Details are shown in Annex 17.
8.06      Malawi per capita GDP in 1971 was estimated at US$84, for Project
participants, pre-Project this figure is US$15 and post-Project about US$34.
IX.  REC0ITENDATIONS
9.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government
that:
(a) the consultants engaged to carry out the road engineering
studies and their terms of reference would be mutually
acceptable to Government and IDA (4.11);
(b) the Ministry of Health would make available staff and mate-
rials required for the efficient running of health services
in the Project area (4.13);
(c) Government would appoint to the post of Senior Research
Officer a suitably qualified and experienced person and
v.   that it would consult with IDA prior to his appointment
(4.15);
(d) procurement of vehicles, machinerY, equipment, and fertilizers
would be bulked annually and would be by international com-
petitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines; construc-
tion work to adapt the railway bridge wzould be done by Malawi
Railways which would call for international competitive bid-
ding in accordance with IDA guidelines. The road engineering
consultants would be selected from a list of international
firms to be agreed between Government and IDA; draft tender
documents for all contracts exceeding US$25,000 would be sub-
mitted to IDA for approval before invitations were issued;
and bid analyses and recommendations for award would be
submitted to IDA for comment before award (5.05);
(e) accounts would continue to be audited by an independent
auditor satisfactory to IDA and that accounts would be
submitted to IDA not later than six months after the
closing of the Project's financial year (5.07);



- 21 -
(f) the person appointed as Project Manager would be mutually
acceptable to Government and IDA (para 6.01);
(g) present arrangements for the administration of credit would
be continued (6.04);
(h)  seasonal credit charge would continue to be 10% and medium-
term interest rate would be 10% per annum and that IDA would
be consulted prior to any changes (6.05).
9.02      During negotiations, Government indicated that it intended to
phase out the subsidy on cotton sprayers (6.06).
9.03      It would be a condition of credit effectiveness that the Government
had executed an agreement with ADMARC acceptable to IDA for the financing of
markets and part of seasonal credit (5.04).
9.04      Subject to the above assurances, the project is suitable for an
IDA credit of US$10.5 million. The Government of Malawi would be the
borrower.

SHIRE VALLEY AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - PHASE II
Agricultural Background
A. General and Climatic
General
1.        The Lower Shire Valley (2,600 sq mi) is located in the south
western corner of Malawi, between latitude 15°301 and 17°10' and longitude
34010' and 35°20' (map), at about 200 ft above sea level. It is bounded
by escarpments to the east and west and is bisected by the Shire River.
The river drains Lake Malawi and its associated escarpments via the Living-
stone Falls in the north and continues through the Elephant and Ndindi
marshes to join the Zambezi in the south. The average annual river flow,
measured at Liwonde (map), is 11,000 cusecs and the low water flow 6,000
cusecs. The Ruo River, which joins the Shire at Chiromo, adds a further
2,000 cusec to the main flow.
Climate
2.        The Lower Shire Valley has a tropical climate, with the mean maxi-
mum temperature varying from 99°F in October to 81°F in June. The mean
minimum varies from 73°F in January to 56°F in June. There is a six-month
rainy season from November to April and the rest of the year is dry. Tables
1 and 2 give details of monthly and annual rainfall totals at Ngabu and
Chikwawa (map). In years which show less than 2 inches in any one month of
the four-month growing season, a partial crop failure is possible; this
occurs about one year in five.
B. Agricultural Background
3.        Traditionally, the cropping pattern in the valley involved the
growing of maize, sorghum, and millet under shifting cultivation; cotton
was introduced about 40 years ago as a cash crop. In the 1950's, a close
season for cotton plant residues was re-established to reduce insect damage
but not until the 1960's were insecticides used. A British-subsidized
scheme expanded the use of insecticides with good results and this was fol-
lowed in 1968 by the Lower Shire Cotton Development Project, financed by
IDA. This latter project expanded cotton growing in the four years follow-
ing 1968 by some 5,300 improved farmers who, by using insecticidal sprays,
produced an additional 7,000 tons of seed cotton in 1972; 15,000 unimproved
growers in the valley produced only 5,000 tons in the same year.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
4.        A 1,000-acre flood irrigation scheme for rice growing has recently
been developed by Taiwan technicians at Muona on the east bank of the Ruo
River. Rice growing has also been expanded on other river outlets using
rainfall augmented by diverted wet weather river flows. A small quantity
of the Malimba variety of groundnuts has been successfully grown in the
valley for sale across the border and to ADMARC. In 1963, some 12,000 acres
of irrigable land was alienated and developed as a sugar estate.

SHIRE VALLEY AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - PHASE II
Crop Improvement Program, Cropping Patterns and Farm Budgets
Crop Improvement Program
1.        General.  Cotton production would be expanded through the provi-
sion of credit for sprayers and insecticide. Other crops would be developed
by the provision of credit for fertilizer and better seed for maize and rice
and improved seed for groundnuts and sorghum. Table 1 gives details of the
number of farming families who would receive credit over a five-year period
and the acreages involved. The farming families using improved methods
would increase from 9,600 out of a total of 53,900 families in 1973, to
25,900 out of a total of 62,500 in 1978.
2.        Cotton.  The future development of cotton growing in the Project
would be a continuation of the Phase I Shire Valley Agricultural Development
Project, which concentrated on the provision of medium-term credit for back-
pack sprayers and annual credit for insecticides. The participating farmer
would use the back-pack hand spray to apply insecticides 10 to 12 times per
annum, depending on the severity of insect attack. He would be advised by
the extension staff when to spray.
3.        Repayments for the annual and medium-term loans would be made at
the time the cotton was sold through the only outlet at the ADMARC markets.
A 50% subsidy in the Phase I credit fund enabled the farmer to repay the K 20
cost in two installments of K 12 and K 10. The Project would abolish the
subsidy by Year 5, as follows:

Year 1                      14          10          -           24          20
Year 2                      14          10          8           32         26

The cost per acre to participating farmers for insecticides would be based
on a package costing K 10.25, plus a 12% mark-up for handling and 10% for
credit, totaling K 12.70.



ANNEX 2

4.        A program of aerial spraying, which in Phase I reached a total of
1,000 acres per annum, would be extended to cover a maximum of 3,000 acres,
subject to annual review. Simultaneously, the ultra low volume spray trials
now underway would be extended to cover 1,000 acres in the first year to
further test technical and economic feasibility. There are advantages and
disadvantages with the three different systems of spraying. A hand sprayer
requires high labor, water, and medium-term inputs but it is efficient,
suitable for traditional farmers, and has low annual cost for insecticides.
Aerial spraying, unlike hand and ultra low volume spraying, gives better
control of amount and time of application but the planting of blocks of
cotton by a large number of small farmers presents problems. Ultra low
volume spraying depends on insecticides being carried in small volumes of
vaporizing oils instead of much larger volumes of water, which would allow
spraying in areas where water is scarce; the cost of the simple applicator
is one-third of the back-pack but the present difficulties with droplet size
and underleaf coverage are still not resolved. Aerial and ultra low volume
spraying both have the advantage of reaching the very small grower, presently
impossible because of the high cost of the back-pack. Spraying methods would
be continually reviewed.
5.        For the period of the Project, the variety Albar A637 and its
selections would continue to be used. This variety is particularly suitable
because of its high resistance to jassid attack, resilience to temporary
moisture shortages, and its fiber strength. Yields obtained from cotton
growing in Phase I are well documented, with an average of over 900 lb of
seed cotton per acre being obtained by improved farmers with hand sprays and
over 1,000 lb from aerial spraying. The best farmers consistantly obtain
yields of 1,200 lb per acre.
6.        Maize.  This crop, along with sorghum and some finger millet, is
grown as a subsistence food crop, mainly on the east bank, under poor con-
ditions of management. Field and research station trials have shown that
with early planting, ridging, and addition of nitrogen, plus improved syn-
thetic seed, maize yields increase to above 2,400 lb per acre.  It is esti-
mated that improved farmers would average 1,800 lb per acre compared with
the present average yield of 600 lb per acre. The average farmer would grow
2 acres of maize and the project would provide credit for annual inputs of
30 lb seed and 100 lb of sulphate of ammonia per acre. Further increases
in yields would depend on the research program producing and testing a suit-
able low altitude hybrid variety.
7.        Rice.  With the completion of the Muona scheme, no further large-
scale smallholder rice scheme is envisaged for the valley. The Project
would provide credit for inputs of fertilizer and better seed for existing
farmers growing a single crop, based on rainfall, augmented by flood water
or diverted river water. These areas are situated in the fantail outlets
of rivers debouching from the escarpments across the plains. Rice yields
of improved farmers would rise from 400 lb to 2,000 lb per acre and the
number of improved farmers from 1,100 in Year 1 to 3,000 in Year 5. Yields
presently obtained on the Muona scheme exceed 2,200 lb per acre.

8.        Cocoa.  The Project envisages a program for 200 acres of irrigated
cocoa, starting with 10 farmers with 1 ac each in Year 1, rising through
40 acres in Year 2, 50 acres in Year 3 and, finally, 100 acres in Year 4.
The cocoa would be grown under irrigation and would be established under a
cover crop of bananas. Fertilizer would be applied from Year 2 onwards.
Experimental results over 15 years demonstrate yields of up to 3,000 lb per
acre, and averaging 2,000 lb. The smallholder would average 1,500 lb,
starting at one-third production in Year 3. No disease problems have been
found but the cocoa requires heavy shade (provided by the bananas) until its
own canopy is established. The Project would provide credit for inputs at
K 45 per acre; establishment, K 15; cultivation, earth movement, and banana
shade, K 15; fertilizer, K 10; and hardwood fermentation boxes, K 5. The
loan would be repayable over two years, with a two-year moratorium.
9.        Groundnuts.  A small acreage of the round kernelled Malimba con-
fectionary groundnut is, at present, grown in the southern sandy soil areas
of the valley. The Project would provide credit for improved seed and ex-
tension advice to improve the yield of participating farmers from 400 lb
shelled nuts per acre to 800 lb; this latter yield is already being obtained
by improved local farmers. The Malimba variety has a regular kernel easily
shelled mechanically and ADMARC accepts it either shelled or unshelled.
10.       Cropping Patterns and Budgets.  A land use planner and field
enumerators have commenced a survey of agriculture in the Project area.
The valley was divided into six areas and surveys were made of numbers and
types of farmers, acreages of crops, and farming patterns. Table 2 gives
average acreages of crops in the three main farming systems; although in-
dividual farmers vary greatly. The estimated increase in yield in crop
production associated with the varying farming patterns in the valley is
shown in Table 3 and allows for the fact that every improved farmer will
progress at different rates and not necessarily grow every crop suitable
for his area.
11.       Phase I experience shows that improved farmers tend to increase
areas of cash crops; this is reflected in the budgets shown in model form.
The estimated situation for improved farmers in the three main cropping
areas, compared with unimproved farmers, is shown in Tables 4,5, and 6.

LALAWI
SHIRE VALLEY AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - PHASE II
Livestock Development
General
1.        The Lower Shire Valley is the only area in MIalawi capable of raising
prime quality beef animals on grass. The valley has no serious cattle disease
problems, except trypanosomiasis, which is being successfully controlled by
inoculation. The valley is not yet overstocked, but localized areas are
overgrazed, partly due to poor water distribution and the need to keep the
cattle away from the cropped areas during the growing season. The grassland
area bordering the swamps and river banks remain green during the dry season
and provide key grazing at an otherwise limiting period. A program developed
in 1969 has resulted in the training of a few work oxen, which have proved
useful for cultivation and transport purposes.
2.        The low foothills on the eastern escarpment have a cover of light
Brachystegia woodland, with Hypherrhenia, Brachiaria and Eragrostis spp.
as common grasses. This area has reasonable potential as summer grazing,
but is unused at present because there is insufficient surface water
available.
Project Development
3.        The project would establish and develop two grazing schemes of
cattle owners in selected areas. Small dams, weirs, and boreholes would
be constructed along with the necessary firebreaks, tracks, stock routes,
cattle crushes, dips, and boundary cuts. Development would be conditional
on both the cattle owners and the local authorities accepting control of
stock numbers and grazing periods in predetermined areas. Local political
leaders and farmers have indicated their willingness to participate in such
a scheme. All stock would be branded with the owner's number as well as a
grazing scheme brand. Each year, owners would replace dead and culled stock
with newly branded animals and dispose of excess numbers beyond their
entitlement. No stock migration would be permitted into a grazing scheme
area but new stock permits to meet increasing carrying capacity would be
issued by the Grazing Committee, although project management would have the
power to veto. Stock in a scheme would summer in the hills during the
period of crop growth in the valley and would graze the crop aftermaths
and associated grass in the dry season; in the dry months before the rains,
they would graze the narrow riverine flood areas.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
4.        The cattle population in the area, which would be divided into
two schemes, at present numbers some 11,500 head on 200,000 acres. Access
to the 115,000 acres of hill grazing would raise the overall carrying capacity
to 22,000 head, a rate of 1 beast to 15 acres. Table 1 shows the present
production of cattle and Table 2 the improved performance brought about by
project action. The control of cattle numbers according to the availability
of grazing would result in a steadily increasing body weight, a greater num-
ber of calves, and fewer deaths.  As a result of the project, the offtake of
fat cattle would rise by about 1,800 head, valued at K 103,000. Detailed
cost estimates are given in Annex 12.
Work Oxen
5.        In addition to the grazing schemes, the project would establish
three ox training centers and provide medium-term credit for the purchase of
oxen at K 150 per pair, repayable over two years.

SHIRE VALLEY AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - PHASE II
Fisheries Development
A. Fisheries of Nialawi
Natural Setting, and Yield of the Fisheries
1.        Malawi being a landlocked country, all fishing is carried out in
inland waters. Total estimated catch in 1971 amounted to 44,700 tons 1/
of which some 8,200 tons (8%) were taken in the Lower Shire Valley. The bulk
of the present production is derived from the exploitation of wild stocks
of fish in the lakes and rivers and adjacent marshes and flooded areas; the
main species are Tilapia and Catfish (Clarias). Some small-scale fish
farming is carried out in various parts of Malawi but with insignificant
output.
2.        The present fisheries yield could be increased safely by 10,000
tons for the country as a whole, but a detailed estimate of the maximum
sustainable yield from the exploitation of existing wild stocks will have to
await the development of improved assessment techniques. However, if fish
culture can be developed economically, further expansion of the fishery
industry would be feasible.
Government Policy
3.        Fish is the main source of animal protein for the people of
Malawi, 18 lb per capita compared with 7 lb from other sources of animal
protein, and this total is considerably below the nutrionally desired per
capita intake. Efforts have been made recently, both to develop the
fisheries in natural bodies of water and to explore the prospects for fish
culture. Development work is mainly carried out through experimental
fishing, research, and education and training. In the long-term view, the
Lower Shire Valley offers some of the best opportunities for fisheries
development in Malawi; the first stage in development would include the
expansion of existing fisheries and experimentation with fish culture.
1/   All tonnages in this annex refer to short tons.



ANNEX 4

B. Lower Shire Fisheries
Fish Farming at Kasinthula
4.        It has been. estimated that some 50,000 acres of land in the valley,
which for various reasons is unsuitable for agriculture, would be well suited
for fish farming. In the area of the Kasinthula Irrigation Project (map),
an experimental fish farm is already being developed and some results have
been obtained.
Fishing in the Marshes and in the River
5.        A large part of the Lower Valley, is occupied by the flood plain
of the Shire River with its associated permanent marshes, lagoons, and
seasonally flooded areas. The largest permanent marshes, Elephant and
Ndinde, constitute some 10% of the total area of the valley. The following
facts concerning the Lower Shire Fisheries have been taken from a recent
report of a fisheries survey carried out by the Malawi Fisheries Department,
aided by the British Government. This survey, with associated research
activities, is to be continued.   Production in 1971 totaled 8,200 tons and
was harvested as follows:
(a) The Elephant Harsh - with a total area of some 200 sq mi,
produced 6,400 tons of fish;
(b)  The Bangula  larsh - the smallest of the three marshes is very
highly populated with fishermen during the rainy season but
the fishery declines during the dry season. Landings from
this area totaled 400 tons;
(c)  Ndindi Marsh - like the Elephant HIarsh, it is a complex of
lagoons and channels among large areas of dense reeds and
seasonal flood areas. Most of the bodies of water, however,
stay throughout the year without drying up, as the complex
is fed by the river itself. The yield from this area was
1,200 tons;
(d) Chikwawa lagoons - these support only a small fishing community.
The total yield from these lagoons was only 200 tons; and
(e) Shire River - fishing activity in the river itself is limited
to fish traps, back water gill netting, and dip nets. Production
figures for the river are included under the areas referred
to above.
6.        Fishing in the valley depends entirely on the flow of water in
the Shire River and, to some extent, its tributary, the Ruo River. Assuming
a fairly regular supply of water and no extensive land reclamation in the
marshes, the maximum sustainable yield has been tentatively estimated at



ANNEX 4
Page 3
12,000 to 13,000 tons annually. About 70% of the fish produced in the
valley is consumed locally, being sold at trading centers close to the
fishing area. Most of the fish sold outside the valley is transported by
rail to the Shire Highlands markets at Thyolo and Luchenza. The total number
of fishermen is reported to be 2,400. Various fishing methods are used
and 20% of the total catch is sold fresh, while 80% is smoked.
C. Future Development
7.        Objectives of the fisheries sector of the project now proposed
would be to increase fish catches from the present level of some 8,200 tons
to a level of 12,000 to 13,000 tons annually by providing staff and services
to the local fishermen; research activities would also be increased.
8.        Project activities would include:
(a) Exploitation of new fishing grounds;
(b) Improvement of processing techniques;
(c) Improvement of the local marketing network;
(d) Studies of water, its controlled flow through the
marshes, and the prospect of retaining water in
lagoons for longer periods of time; and
(e) Improvement of the exploitation of known stocks and
of hitherto unexploited stocks.
The estimated development cost over five years would be approximately
' 196,000. Detailed cost estimates are given in Annex 12.
Fishing
9.        The traditional fishery is specialized in nature and one fisherman
tends to own and operate only one kind of gear on an intermittent basis.
Emphasis in future would be placed on the integration of the fishing units
to effect an all-year-round fishing activity. This would be done by
improving existing gear and its use, alternating gear for the differing
seasonal conditions, and improving canoes. The common craft for fishing in
the marshes and lagoons is a dugout canoe, but due to the scarcity of
building material, new canoes are not readily available. During the fisheries
survey referred to above, a simply constructed 14-foot plank canoe was
tested and demonstrated to fishermen and was found to be a suitable future
replacement for the traditional canoe. The Department of Fisheries would
assist trained boat builders to establish five simple boat-yards, which,
in the Project period, would produce 225 boats.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
Access to Fisheries
10.       As the fishery is mainly a flood-plain and swamp fishery, it is
influenced a great deal by seasonal fluctuations in water levels. Very
low levels of water in the lagoons and marshes following a dry spell result
in the migration of fish into deeper water of the river or among the reeds;
this reduces the number of active fishermen. On the other hand, when the
river floods, fish return to the lagoons and marshes but most of the
fishing grournc.s b.>ecome inaccessible by road or path; this situation reduces
the number of fish buyers reaching the area and, in turn, their scarcity
slows down fishing activitty   The project would provide for the construction
of 20 miles of all-weather roads to improve access.
Fish ProcessJ?nL
1I.       Fish processiig in the Lower Shire is done by fish traders who buy
fresh fishi frcL t-e fisitermen at the landing beaches and smoke-dry it.  The
method being used is traditional, roasting over a pit fire, which is
wasteful of fuel and time, The West African type of kiln, already in use
in other oarts of MIalawi, would be introduced to save time and fuel.  The
Project  wou-'d therefure ; introduce 50 oL the new-type kiln for demonstra-
tion purposes.
Training and Lx tension 14ork
12.       Thie main work p-roposed for the improvement of fishery would be
the establishment of extension and training centers for fishing and fish
processing demonstracions.  Each of about 50 beach stations would have a
fishing boatt  different ty-es ef rIshing gear, and smoking kiln and all
would be in the bands or risheries demonstrators. At Nchacha, 16 courses
of three week's  duration would be conducted for eight fishermen at a time.
Research and inVest4'o_  s
13.       Tile ongoing BriciJsh-aided fisheries research program would be
extended and diversified to cover not onily biology, population dynamics,
and stock assessment, but aIso plankton. work, limmology, and microbotany.
Future develonmen.;  of the fishing industry would depend on the effective
operation of thbese research activities, and provision would be made under
the proposed proJect for the purchase of supplementary equipment, including
electronic fish-finding equipment. Provision would also be made for an
engineering survey of the present fishing area; the lagoons at Chikwawa
and the Bangula H.arsh are virtually fish ponds, restocked annually from the
Shire River, and the possibility of controlling the water levels with simple
sluice gates or weirs in them as well as in other smaller lagoons, would be
explored; the Elephant and Ndinde Marshes are formed by branch channels of
the Shire River fiowing into them, and a survey of the conditions of the
entrance to these channels would be made so that possible silting may be
attended to in time. At Kasinthula, fish culture experiments would be
expanded as there are large areas of the valley suitable for fish farming
(para 4). Thne fisheries research program in the Shire Valley would be
carried out bY the senior fisheries officer attached to the project.



ANNEX 4
Page 5
Control of Pollution
14.       As insecticides are used extensively in the catchment area of the
Shire River, their buildup in fish would continue to be monitored.
D. Fishery Benefits
15.       This project would contribute to an increase in the supply of
animal protein. At maturity, the equivalent of an additional 1,400 tons
of smoked fish would be produced annually. Also, it would contribute to
the knowledge and understanding of aquatic resources and thus pave the
way for a rational future exploitation of resources.
16.       The total number of fishermen would increase slightly from 2,400
in 1972 to 2,650 in 1977. Of these 2,650 fishermen, it is estimated that
about 1,000 would respond to the campaign to improve their fishing. An
estimated average budget is given in Table 1, and, compared with estimated
1972 net earnings, shows an increase of K 247 (ITS$297) per man per year when
the fishermen and his family process the fish.  If the entire catch is sold
as wet fish, the average increase in earnings derived from fishing would
be reduced to K 160 (US$192) per man per year.  An important indirect benefit
of rural development programs is the subsequent demand for small agro-industries.
The project would assist the Fisheries Department program in training and in
setting up 25 boat-yards in the valley to satisfv the demand which would be
created by the improved fishing program.
Fish Prices
17.       Prices to the fisherman can be expected to improve during the
period of the project as a result of a combination of the following:
(a) The introduction of feeder roads to several beaches, which
will provide easier access to these landing areas and
should result in increased competition between buyers.
Experience from two sites on Lake Chilwa, one where a
connecting road was constructed in 1968 and one without
a road, illustrates the effect that improved communica-
tions can have on the prices paid for the same species
of fish:

(b) The clearing of canoe channels through the marshes,
which would improve access to landing sites and thus
reduce deterioration of fish prior to sale as wet or
processed fish.
(c) The introduction of improved kiln-drying processing,
which is expected to improve quality and lead to better
producer prices. Smoke-drying costs would also be re-
duced substantially (see Table 1), thus benefitting the
fishermen.
(d) A study of the fish marketing situation in the area in
association with similar country-wide studies, which
should ultimately lead to improved producer prices.
In the fisherman's budget shown in Table 1, it is assumed that, during the
period of the project, producer prices would improve in the order of 15%.

MALAWI
SHIRE VALLEY AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - PHASE II
Credit
Background
1.        Since 1965, credit has played an increasingly important part in
the development pattern of Malawian agriculture. In that year, some 6,000
farming families obtained credit amounting to K 124,000 but, by 1971, 33,000
families had drawn down K 880,000. It is estimated that by 1974, the credit
requirements for agriculture would exceed K 2 million. The proportion of
seasonal credit to medium-term credit is about 85:15 and is likely to
remain of this order in the foreseeable future.
2.        There are five main agricultural development projects in Malawi
(of which the first three mentioned have been financed by IDA), namely,
Lilongwe, Shire Phase I, Karonga, Kasungu, and Salima. These projects are
the main source of credit for farmers and their share of the total credit
fund will increase over the next few years.
3.        The credit finances for the development projects are handled by
the project staff and are made available only to farmers within the projects.
ADMARC provides credit to farmers elsewhere in the country. There is great
need, however, to develop a soundly constituted and well managed central in-
stitution in Malawi to handle the overall credit program; this is actively
under consideration by Government.
4.        Interest rates, as such, are not applied in Malawi; instead a
credit charge of 10%, equivalent to about an annual rate or 12% and sufficient
to cover operating costs, is added to the cost of inputs. This method of
charging a fixed price for farm inputs bought on credit through the project
administration is particularly appropriate under Malawi conditions. It
eliminates the need for individual percentage interest calculations on each
loan and for any recalculations on overdue repayment. It is acceptable to
the farmers, who know at the time of buying inputs exactly what their
cost will be.
5.        Partly due to the efficient credit organization set up within the
various projects and partly due to the social responsibilities of the people
§_a whoJle, the repayment record on project credit is excellent.  Bad debts
on due date do not exceed 3% and it is likelv that at least half of these
will be collected.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
Project Proposals
6.        Credit would be required by project participants to cover the
purchase of seasonal inputs, such as insecticides, fertilizer, and seed,
particularly for cotton and maize. Investment credit would also be required
for the purchase of cotton sprayers, fishing boats, and work oxen. Details
are shown in Table 1.
7.        Credit Supply and Administration.  Under the project, Government would
continue to provide funds for seasonal and medium credit, but, in future, ADMARC
would provide the finance for a proportion of seasonal credit. Administration of
the two credit funds would be carried out by project staff, consisting of a chief
credit accountant and two assistants, at project headquarters, together with a
credit assistant situated at each of the 41 markets. The general accounts
of the credit fund would be maintained at project headquarters and the
individual accounts at each tnarket. It is estimated that the recurrent costs
of administration, including salaries, would amount to about K 28,000 annually
at full development.
8.        Seasonal Credit.  This would rise from K 152,000 in the first year
of the project to K 1,132,000 in the fifth year and thereafter (Annex 12).
The present successful system of operating credit would continue to be used.
Farmers requiring credit would have their application approved by the exten-
sion and credit officers working together and all credit would be supplied
in kind from ADMARC market centers. A record of the transactions would be
maintained on triplicate cards, one to be retained by the borrower, one by
ADMLARC, and one by the credit officer; each card would also stipulate at
which market the farmers' produce would be sold. At harvest time, the farmer
would deliver his crop to the stipulated market and after payment by ADMARC
would hand to the Project Credit Assistant repayments on his outstanding loan.
Normally, the farmer is required to pay 50% of his receipts, or the whole of
his remaining debts, whichever is less.
9.        Medium term Credit.  This would rise from K 165,000 in the first
year of the Project to K 685,000 in Year 5. Medium-term credit would be re-
quired by farmers for cotton sprayers, fishing boats, and oxen and would be
recovered in the same manner as seasonal credit.
10.       Credit Terms.  Government would advance money and ADMARC would pro-
vide credit in kind to the project revolving credit fund at zero interest
rate as in the past and both capital and interest repayments from farmers
would be credited to this fund.

MALAWI
SHIRE VALLEY AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPlENT PROJECT - PHASE II
The Agricultural Development and M4arketing Corporation (ADMARC)
Organization and Objectives
1.        ADMARC is a parastatal body, fully owned by the state, established
in 1962 under the name of the Farmers' Marketing Board. The change of name
to ADMARC took place on April 1, 1971 by Act of Parliament. ADMARC bears a
statutory responsibility for the marketing of smallholder agricultural
produce, with the exception of cassava and rice, which are handled by the
National Oil Industries, Ltd.
2.        ADMARC's Board of Directors consists of a Chairman and four to
eight Directors, all appointed for two years by the Minister of Agriculture
and Natural Resources. Responsibility for overall administration is dele-
gated to a manager, and a divisional supervisor is responsible at District
level.
3.        ADMIARC's objectives are firstly to increase the volume of economic
exportable crops by supplying the agricultural requirements of farmers on
customary land, and secondly, market and export agricultural produce and pro-
mote the consumption of such produce abroad. It also maintains a price stabi-
lization fund, and food reserves to meet possible local shortages, provides
seasonal credit to farmers, and markets petroleum.
Marketing
4.        ADM4ARC carries out its produce purchasing and input distribution
functions through a network of about 700 local markets scattered throughout
the country with five main buying and storage depots at Bangula, Luchenza,
Limbe, Balaka, and Lilongwe. It also operates two storage depots at railhead
at Salima and Liwonde.
5.        The volume of produce handled by ADMARC in recent years has
ranged between 150,000 and 200,000 tons, depending largely on the size of
the marketed maize surplus. The bulk of the maize crop is purchased at
depots from licensed traders, who are the direct link with the producer.
Most of the cotton, groundnuts, tobacco, paddy, and other crops are purchased
direct from farmers at ADMARC's local markets. These markets also provide
the focal point for the timely distribution of farming inputs.
6.        The basic pattern of operation is that the farmers bring produce
to ADIIARC markets and, after a grading has been agreed and the produce
weighed, the producer is paid in cash. Producers are encouraged to do as



ANNEX 6
Page 2
much grading as possible prior to delivery at the market. Each year minimum
producer prices are fixed by government, prior to the planting season, in
consultation with ADMARC.
7.        ADMARC's current storage capacity throughout the country is esti-
mated (in maize equivalents) at around 300,000 tons, divided between markets
and depots. It is forecast that, as a result of development programs envis-
aged, the tonnages handled by ADMARC will rise to around 250,000 tons in 1975
and probablv reach 550,000 tons by 1980.
8.        It is estimated that ADMARC would need to construct, in the project
area, 17 new markets and upgrade three existing markets to cater for the in-
cremental production of crops resulting from the project. This would involve
a capital expenditure of about K 336,000 spread over the four-year period
1973-76.
Financial Situation
9.        In 1970 and 1971, ADMfARC made net surpluses of K 3.9 million
and K 2.6 million, respectively, the fall in 1971 being due to a maize
failure.  Comparative balance sheets and profit and loss accounts for years
ending March 31, 1970 and 1971, are in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 is the break-
doim of 1971 profits by crops and shows that the bulk of ADMARC profits are
derived from tobacco and groundnut marketing.
10.       It is expected that in the future ADMARC would be able to maintain and
increase such levels of orofit. An assessment of future profitability and cash
flow was made to ensure that ADMARC would be in a position to finance the markets
and that part of credit requirements of the project to be financed by it.
National Oil Industries Ltd (NOIL)
11.       National Oil Industries Ltd (NOIL) was incorporated in 1956 as a
linmited liability company, with a K 200,000 share capital divided into
1oo,oon shares of K 2 each, issued and fully paid up. In 1964, the entire
share capital was acquired by the Malavwi Development Corporation. At
present, the following are shareholders:
IMalawi Development Corporation                 46-1/4%
Agriculture Development and Marketing
Corporation                                   46-1/4%

12.       Until 1967, the company engaged solely in the production, from
cottonseed, of edible oil, cottonseed cake, cotton linters, and soap stock.
Rice milling was introduced that year to avoid dependence on a single
crop and at the same time to give support to the Government policy of
increasing paddy production. Recently, cassava handling was added to NOIL's
responsibilities. NOIL's milling capacity is as follows:
Product         Location        Annual Capacity        Remarks
Cottonseed      Blantvre         12,000 tons /!    Being expanded to 18,000

added in the near future)

Central Region has started
Cassava         Central
Region         15,000 tons
/1   All tonnages are short tons.
Resources
13.       The company's principal resource has been its share capital of
K 200,000 and accumulated reserves, which by December 31, 1971 stood at
K 137,000. In 1965, NOIL received a loan negotiated by the Government
with the German Kreditanstalt (DM 1.1. million, or K 72,000, of which K 58,000
was outstanding on the above date). The loan was for a term of 15 years,
including five years' grace, with interest at 6-1/2% per annum. NOIL
obtained a general-purpose loan of K 100,000 from the Standard Bank Finance
and Development Corporation in 1968 for a term of 12 years, including two
years of grace, at a rate of 8% per annum. NOIL has access to temporary funds
by way of overdraft with the National Bank, the present limit being K 600,000,
at 10-1/2% per annum secured by stocks.

MALAWI
SHIRE VALLEY AGRICULTUEAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - PHASE II
Development of Communications
Present Situation
1.        The Shire Valley is accessible from the north by two main roads
and a railway. Both roads make an almost direct descent of the Thyolo
Escarpment - a drop of about 3,000 feet in about 20 miles; they are
consequently very steep, tortuous, and difficult and expensive to maintain.
The railway takes a more circuitous route and enters the valley about half
wav down the project area. See Map IBRD 10134.
2.        The more important of the two main roads 1/ is the M8 from
Blantyre to Chikwawa, which crosses the river by a recently constructed
road bridge. The M8 continues southwards throughout the length of the
project area on the west bank of the river to Bangula, where it joins the
other main road (M9) and the railway. The M8 continues via Nsanie to
Marka at the Mozambique border. The escarpment section of the M8 road
is gravelled, but, due to the excessive gradient, sharp curves, and inade-
quate drainage, the surface is very rough. The steep gradient and sharp
curves also limit the size of trucks than can use the road safely. During
the wet season, only four-wheel drive vehicles (FWD) can use the escarpment.
Between Chikwawa and Bangula, the road follows the edge of the river flood
plain and parts of it are liable to flooding. The road is gravelled over
some sections, but, due to the subsoil, the road is liable to severe rutting
during the wet season and can only be used with difficulty by light FWD
vehicles. There are also some paved fords which are impassable for some
hours after heavy rains. From Bangula to Nsanje the earth-surfaced road
follows the river closely. During the rains, it quickly becomes impassable
to normal vehicles, and, as there are no drainage structures, flash floods
frequently close the road for several hours. During high flood stages of the
river, the road is completely inundated, sometimes for weeks at a time. From
Nsanje to the frontier at Marka, the road follows slightly higher ground and
the soil is of a more granular nature; thus, although there are no drainage
structures, it is less affected by rain and floods.
1/   In Malawi, 'primary routes' are legally termed 'main roads'.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
3.        The escarpment section of the second main road into the valley -
the M9 - from Blantyre to Bangula via Cholo, is not engineered and has steep-
er gradients and sharper curves than the Chikwawa route. Although the road
has adequate cross drainage, it is surfaced with materials, which quickly
makes the route impassable after rain. From the foot of the escarpment to
the Shire River crossing at Chiromo-Bangula, the road is subject to flooding
by the Ruo River, which runs close to it for about 10 miles. The Shire
River is crossed by a ferry adequate for existing traffic, but subject
to interruption when the river is in flood or when large mats of weeds,
worked loose by floods, flow down the river. Furthermore, it cannot
operate at night. The M9 joins the M8 at Bangula two miles west of the
river; this approach is also covered at high flood stages.
4.        In addition to the main roads described above, the secondary road,
S.38, connecting the M8 and M9 main roads along the east bank of the Shire
River at the foot of the 4,500 foot Thyolo escarpment, is also important for
the development of the project. This earth road crosses nine major rivers,
several of whiich have a perpetual flow, but all are subject to flash
floods capable of washing down rocks and boulders. There are no bridges
on the road and river crossings are paved fords, which frequently suffer
severe damage by floods. The depth of water and the swift current at the
fords, together with the quagmire condition of the road during the rains,
makes the road impassable, even to FWD vehicles, for long periods at a time.
During Phase I of the Lower Shire Valley Agricultural Project, about 24 miles
of existing minor roads on the west bank were improved by reshaping and
gravelling, and 160 miles of new crop extraction roads were constructed,
some of which were gravelled.
5.        Until 1971 Malawi's or:ly feasible outlet to the sea for export/
import traffic was via the Malawi Railway from Blantyre and the Lower Shire
Valley to Beira on the Indian Ocean. In 1971 a new rail link was made to
connect the northern section of Mozambique Railways with an ocean terminal
at Ncala. The port facilities at Ncala are at present limited but the new
route does offer an alternative to Beira, particularly when the railway in
the Lower Shire Valley is unserviceable due to floods. The importance of the
railway in the valley is that it provides a reasonably reliable route for
agricultural inputs and export of products. The main role of the railway to
Malawi, however, is to provide for the bulk movement of imports and exports
via Beira and more recently the transit traffic between Rhodesia, Beira, and
northern lozambique.  The railway has several 'halts' in the valley, but the
only important station is at Bangula.
6.        The Shire River is navigable to Chikwawa for most of the year
and before the railway was built it was used as the principal route from
the ocean to Blantyre. At the present time, the river is not used commer-
cially, but there is a proposal to make limited use of it for shipment of
cane sugar within the project area.

Future Planning
7.        The rudimentary state of communications has no doubt inhibited
development of the valley in the past. The Government is conscious of the
need for improved communications, but has adopted a policy, without
adequate economic justification, of transporting all produce from the
upper and middle part of the project area to Bangula for shipment by rail.
As this involves a considerably greater route mileage by road and rail than
to Blantyre, it may not be the most economical solution. A technical and
economic feasibility study is being undertaken to investigate the adequacy
of the existing road from Blantyre to Bangula via Chikwawa and to determine
whether this road or sections thereof should be upgraded and to what
standard. The study will also consider whether a new excarpment road should
be developed to serve more effectively and economically the needs of the
Lower Shire Valley traffic corridor.
8.        The viability of the Lower Shire Valley Agricultural Project
depends on an adequate network of crop extraction and evacuation roads.
This in turn requires an all-ceason spine road from Chikwawa to Bangula
and Nsanje, together with a loop road along the east bank connecting with
the west bank spine road at Bangula. The economic and feasibility study
will determine the geometric standard justifiable. In order to improve
its international road communications to Southern Africa, the Government
of Malawi has already decided, in conjunction with the Portuguese
Government, to construct a new road from Chilcwawa to Tete in Mozambique,
which will connect with an existing paved road to Salisbury in Rhodesia.
The new road is likely to become MHalawi's most important international
road connection within a very short time. Under present Government plans,
the road from Chikwawa to Blantyre over the existing escarpment will only
be subjected to minor improvements and given a light bituminous surface.
Thus, the geometric limitations of this escarpment route will be perpetuated,
and development of a healthy trucking industry with more economically sized
trucks, which would reduce ton-mile costs, will be inhibited. An alterna-
tive alignment within acceptable geometric standards which would enable
the larger sized trucks to climb the escarpment is feasible. It is,
however, Government policy to induce all traffic to use the more
circuitous route to Blantyre via Bangula, to the advantage of the railway.
The study of the spine road will, therefore, include a review of the access
to the project area from the north and seek the least cost, long-term
solution. Subject to the findings of the study, the reconstruction of a
section of the M8 main road would form part of a second IDA-financed project
in 1975.
Project Roads
9.        Assuming that the Chikwawa to Bangula spine road will be constructed
to an all-weather standard under another project, the objective of the pro-
posed project would be to establish a skeleton network of roads in the project
area that would be passable, with four-wheel drive vehicles, with a maximum
of 24 hours' delay, except in exceptional circumstances. Thus, first priority



ANNEX 7
Page 4
is given to construction of drainage structures (bridges, paved fords,
and culverts), which would enable the time criteria to be met during normal
rains on the main and secondary roads, M8, M9, and S38. Gravelling would
be carried out only in low lying areas near the river, where the high water
table and the dambo soil would not permit the passage of light trucks to
collect fish at all times of the year. The railway bridge across the river
at Chiromo on the Makanga-Bangula road (M9) would be converted to take road
traffic and the approaches raised above normal flood levels and gravelled.
The ferry service would be discontinued. Provision is also made for the
construction, to a low earth standard of 88 miles of feeder roads in the
project area. The standard of the existing roads between the drainage
structures would be progressively raised by improved maintenance.
10.       The Project would consist of:
(a) improvement of 82 miles of main and secondary roads to
near all-weather standard, including conversion of rail
bridge to take road traffic;
(b) construction of about 108 miles of feeder roads, of which
about 20 miles would be gravelled;
(c) purchase of construction equipment; and
(d) provision of engineering services for (a) and full
engineering of about 60 miles of main road.
Full details are given in Tables 1, 2 and 3.
Design Standards
11.       New bridges would be built with 16'0" single-lane decking and
designed to 2/3 British Standard HA loading, which is adequate for the
largest trucks which can legally operate in Malawi. The railway bridge
would have a 12'0" carriageway between curbs to restrain overhanging
vehicles from damaging the main trusses. The main roads would be shaped up
to the Roads Department standard Class III trapezoidal section with
24'0" formation width. This would permit an 18'0" wide gravel surface
being placed at a later date. The feeder roads would be barrel shaped
with a formation of 30'0" center to center of drains and surfaced with
10'0" width of gravel in low lying areas.
Execution
12.       All the engineering structures would be designed by consultants
and suitable contract documents prepared for bidding by international and
local contractors. The Terms of Reference for the consultants would be
agreed by the Ministry of Works and Supply (MOWS) and IDA in advance.
The consultants would also supervise construction under the general supervi-
sion of the Roads Department of the MOWS. Reshaping of existing roads and



ANNEX 7
Page 5
the construction of short lengths of feeder and collector roads would be
carried out by a road construction unit established under the control of
the project manager. Provision is made in the estimates for the purchase
of equipment for the construction unit and the appointment of an additional
works supervisor (one has already been appointed under Phase I of the proj-
ect). Full engineering in advance cannot be justified for the new roads to
be built, so that they would be engineered to an elementary standard as the
work proceeds. After completion of the construction program, the equipment
would be used for improved maintenance of the roads in the project area.
MIaintenance
13.       The main and secondary roads in the area are maintained by
the Roads Department and are the immediate responsibility of the Regional
Engineer, South. They would continue to be so maintained. The minor roads
are the responsibility of local authorities, whose financial resources are
so limited that, in effect, the roads are not maintained at all. Roads
constructed under Phase I of the project and essential minor roads are
all maintained by the project manager. New feeder and collection roads
constructed or improved under this project would be similarly maintained.

SHIRE VALLEY AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Rural Water Supplies
Background
1.        The main reasons for the development of water supplies in the project
are firstly that bilharzia is prevalent (Annex 9) and the development of bore-
holes would provide a domestic water supply free of the source of this disease.
Secondly, cotton production requires an adequate supply of clean water, near
to cotton fields to ensure timely spraying against insect pests. Thirdly an
even dispersal of water supplies would help reduce the erosion hazard caused
by large herds of cattle, presently being driven to a limited number of water
points. Finally with a source of water relatively close to the homestead,
more labor time would be available for agricultural production.
2.        Over 300 boreholes have been drilled in the Shire Valley and the
rate of success has been nearly 90%; drilling has been carried out by
Government's Water Development Department using small drilling rigs and
local artisans.
3.        The water horizons in the valley occur at depths of about 50 feet
and 120 feet; as the shallower water is often found to be saline, drilling
to the second level is normal. The average yield of boreholes, which have
been fully test pumped, is between 800 and 1,000 gallons per hour; the
existing boreholes are fitted with hand pumps and, as their yield is limited
by the capacity of the pumps to about 300 gallons per hour, there is no
danger of overpumping.
Proposed Development
4.        The population on tile agricultural land of the Shire Valley is
estimated to be about 300,000. It is proposed that one borehole would be
required for every 700 people, and that no family would be more than one
mile from a borehole and, on average, only one-half mile.
5.        The total number of boreholes required to complete development
in the project area is 430 and, with 316 already available, a further 114
would be required. Allowance would be made for dry boreholes and thus 140
holes would be drilled under the project. This work would continue to be
carried out by the Water Development Department, whose present performance
is satisfactory.



ANNEX 8
Page 2
6.        The drilling of the boreholes would be phased over the five-year
development period. The cost of drilling, equipping, and maintaining 140
boreholes, including an allowance for physical contingencies, is estimated
to be K 243,000. Detailed cost estimates are given in Annex 12.

SHIRE VALLEY AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I Development of Health Services
General Health Situation in Malawi
1.        Like most countries in Africa, Malawi is beset by a considerable
number of health problems; communicable diseases are prevalent but the coun-
try has limited finance and manpower to control them. The major diseases
in Malawi are malaria, bilharzia, worm infestation, and tuberculosis. Anemia
and bacterial infection of the intestines are widespread, and nutritional im-
balance among children is common. In 1972, for Malawi's 4 million popula-
tion, the health budget amounted to K 3.3 million (about US$1 per capita) and
only 100 practicing physicians were available; most of the physicians (92%)
are expatriates.
2.        Government health services are delivered by three major hospitals
(Blantyre, Zomba, and Lilongwe), which provide specialist services, including
surgery, and 23 small, ill-equipped district and mission hospitals. Scattered
throughout the country are smaller dispensaries and maternity units. Because
of the rudimentary nature of existing health services, infant mortality is
high (160 per thousand) and life expectancy only 50 years; the loss of life
is compensated by a high birth rate (above 40 per thousand).
Health Policy
3.        In the past, Malawian health services have been heavily oriented
towards curative medicine, with 85% of the annual budget used for this pur-
pose and only 15% for preventive medicine. Government is now, however, aware
of the need to balance the services. As a result of bilateral aid from
Denmark, WHO consultants were financed to study the health problems in Malawi
and make recommendations to Government. The study was completed in December
1971 and the report accepted, in principle, by Government. The report pro-
poses a 15-year plan for the development of an integrated health service and
makes numerous recommendations for improving existing services at all levels.
4.        In order to deliver basic health services, a network of health
units, each serving 50,000 people, is proposed. Such a system would bring
help more within the reach of the population and would allow for referral
to the central hospital, where necessary. Besides providing limited cura-
tive services, the health units would also concentrate on the prevention of
malaria, bilharzia, leprosy, and tuberculosis. They would provide immuniza-
tion against major children's diseases and promote a clean water supply pro-
gram. Medical services would be free as they are throughout the country.



ANNEX 9
Page 2
The Health Situation in the Lower Shire
5.        Although the disease pattern in the Valley does not differ essen-
tially from the overall picture of the country, some diseases (malaria and
bilharzia) are more prevalent, partly due to the geographical situation and
the warmer climate.   The incidence of tuberculosis is also higher in the
Shire Valley than elsewhere in the country.
6.        Comparative nutritional studies indicate the general level of
nutrition in the valley to be significantly lower than the rest of the
population, and it is estimated that a high proportion of the population
is in some state of nutritional imbalance. Kwashiorkor cases are regularly
reported, particularly from January to April.
7.        The existing medical facilities in the Shire Valley are as follows:
District  hospitals         2
Mission hospital            1
Primary health centers      2
Health sub-centers          1
Health posts                7
Dispensaries and
maternity units          16
Future Development for the Lower Shire Valley
S.        The Government intends to develop health services in the Valley in
line with the overall country policy. This involves the provision of the
following:
Health Unit: A health unit consists of one main health
center, four sub-centers and 20 health posts, providing
basic health services to 50,000 persons.
Health Center: A main health center is the heart of the
unit, having 16 beds. It would include an out-patient
department, a simple laboratory, offices for a clinical
officer and a health inspector, and transport. District
hospitals also act as Health Centers.
Health Sub-Center: A smaller unit under supervision
of the main center, and responsible for 10,000 population.
It has a minimum of six beds and is staffed by auxiliary
personnel.
Health Post: A health post covers 2,000 people and is manned
by a homecraft worker. The sub-center staff visits the posts
once a week to provide curative and preventive services.

10.       The staff in the project area would be headed by a medical officer
stationed at Ngabu, and the staff required for each health unit would be:
Health Center              Sub-Center           Health Posts
1 clinical officer         1 medical assistant       1 homecraft worker

SHIRE VALLEY AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Wildlife Conservation and Utilization
1.        There are three areas reserved for wildlife in the Shire Valley --
the Lengwe National Park, the Majete Game Reserve, and the Mwabvi Game
Reserve (see map). The most important is the Lengwe National Park, which
extends to 50 sq mi, proclaimed in 1927 for the protection of the Nyala
antelope. The Park is the most northerly habitat of this antelope and,
since 1964, there has been an apparent build-up in their numbers. The
majority of the visitors to the Park (2,500 a year) are day tourists who
drive out from Blantyre in the morning and return in the afternoon. The
Game Department runs a small lodge in the Park with an eight-bed capacity
for overnight visitors, which has been attracting about 600 tourists a year.
The game reserve located in the northern end of the Valley (Majete) extends
to 230 sq mi and the other reserve (Mwabvi), located in the southern end of
the Valley, extends to about 60 sq mi. In the near future, the latter re-
serve will be increased in size to about 120 sq mi. Neither of these reserves,
however, has been developed for game viewing and they have received little
protection from poachers.
2.        These parks and reserves can be developed in the future as
tourist attractions to include game viewing, fishing, and birdwatching,
but efforts are presently constrained by a lack of road communication from
Southern Africa and Rhodesia into the Valley. These will be overcome when
the Tete/Chikwawa road (map) is completed, probably in 1975.
3.        Government is presently making arrangements for a survey of the
tourist possibilities in Mialawi, the main objective of which will be to
short-list the most important tourist outlets in the country. When the
main roads have been completed into the Lower Shire Valley, Government will
then encourage development of hotels and lodges by private enterprise.
4.        While awaiting the development of main roads and the results of
the survey referred to in paragraph 3, it is important to ensure that the
wildlife resources are preserved. Staff is already available, but limited
infrastructural facilities in the existing park and game reserves prevents
adequate protection of the game. The Project would provide for minimum
capital inputs in housing for field staff, the construction of tracks, and
the fencing of Lengwe Park. The total cost is estimated at K 44,300 (Annex 12).

SHIRE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Agricultural and Fisheries Research
Present Situation
1.        Agricultural research is served by three stations in the Lower
Shire Valley -- Makanga, Ngabu, and Kashinthula. Fisheries research is
at Chiromo (map). Makanga (300 acres) carries out fertilizer and variety
trials on the commonly grown rainfed crops such as maize, sorghum, ground-
nut, and millet, together with irrigated trials on rice, grass, fodder crops,
cocoa, and wheat. It is run by the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Re-
sources (MANR) and is well equipped and staffed. However, being on the
southern end of the east bank, it is somewhat inaccessible and subject to
occasional flooding; importantly, it has soils and rainfall atypical of the
rest of the Valley.
2.        Ngabu Research Station (50 acres), in the center of the valley, has
developed a small rainfed crop trial area with a program similar to Makanga.
In addition, it operates field trials on the Makande soils where there are
special problems associated with cotton production. This station is run by
existing Project staff and the experimental program is determined after
consultation with MANR and the Agricultural Research Council.
3.        Kasinthula irrigatianstation and pilot farm, in the north of the
Valley near Chikwawa, was developed recently under an FAO program. The
pumping facilities command over 200 acres of heavy and light soils, typical
of the area and most of the land under command has been levelled and bunds
constructed. A central store and workshop have been built and staff ac-
commodation will be constructed in 1972. Kasinthula was developed with two
main objectives: first, to obtain revenue from commercial crops and fish
ponds, and second, to collect information on mechanized irrigation and suit-
able crops for the proposed large-scale irrigation project. Government has
been considering the appointment of managing agents to expedite research
before any development commitment is made to the main irrigation scheme.
Twenty-five rice growing smallholders have been settled and a further 75
will be settled in the near future. The work at this station at present is
not well directed and the research results have been adversely affected by
poor land levelling.



ANNEX 11
Page 2
Proposed Research Organization
4.        There is a need to direct and coordinate research activities in
the project area. The overall research program for the project would be
directed by the Director of Agricultural Research of M1ANR and would be ad-
ministered by a Senior Research Officer (SRO) based at Ngabu, responsible
to the Project Manager. For the irrigation research program, the Director
would be advised by an irrigation engineer and an agronomist. These ex-
perts would advise on the overall research program and analyze the previous
years' results. Fishery experiments carried out under the project would be
determined on the advice of the Chief Fisheries Officer after consultation
with the Director; a Fisheries Officer, responsible to the SRO, would imple-
ment the proposals.
5.        Staff Requirement.  Two professional officers and one farm manager
would be provided from Government resources. The project would make provi-
sion for the appointment of Senior Research Officers and three professional
officers to complete the agricultural research team. The Fisheries Research
Officer would be provided by UNDP. The project would also provide additional
housing and equipment as well as annual running costs for a five-year period
(Annex 12).
6.        Proposed Research Program.  The program proposed for the five-year
development period would make full use of existing facilities and would be as
follows:
(a) Makanga Station would concentrate on a cotton and maize
seed bulking program, and, over a period of two years,
would run down its present research program on dryland
and irrigated crops. The spare accommodation and
laboratory facilities that would accrue would be fully
utilized by the project Fisheries and Training sections.
(b) Ngabu Station would be augmented by a small laboratory to
deal with chemical analyses associated with the overall
research program. The Ngabu station would become the main
center for trials on dryland crops and the staff would
also supervise field trials, particularly on the Makande
Plains.
(c) Kasinthula Irrigation Research Station. As there is an
irrigation potential of some 40,000 acres in the Valley,
irrigation research is of considerable importance. The
research program would endeavor to gain the maximum amount
of information on which to base possible irrigation devel-
opment. The program would investigate agricultural, live-
stock, and fish production. Crop varieties, fertilizers
and water regimes would be tested, aimed particularly at
developing farning systems suitable for traditional farmers.
Promising results from this research station would be



ANNEX 11
Page 3
further tested, both for mechanized farming and on the
nearby smallholder scheme. The program would also
investigate the possibility of supplementary irrigation
for cotton.
7.        Field Research.  Each research station would carry out field trials
at selected points throughout the valley to further test promising results.
To work with the existing MANR Soil Productivity Research Team, the project
would appoint an agronomist, who would investigate the 2lakande soil char-
acteristics.
8.        Cost.  The cost of research, over the five-year development period,
would be K 720,000 (Annex 12).

SIIIRE VALLEY AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - PHASE II
Marketing, Processing and Price Projection
1.        At full development, the project would increase the annual production
of seed cotton by 18,400 tons, 1/ maize by 33,022 tons, rice by 5,460 tons,
and groundnut kernels by 1,500 tons. In addition, beef production would
be increased by 428 tons and fish production by 3,590 tons of wet fish.
All crops would be purchased by the Agricultural Development and Marketing
Corporation (ADEMRC) at market centers established within the production
areas. ADMARC would also be responsible for processing and selling cotton
lint, groundnuts, surplus maize, and sorghum. Rice and cottonseed processing
and disposal would be the responsibility of the National Oil Industries Ltd
(NOIL).
Cotton Production and Processing
2.        Albar 637 cotton would be produced.  It has a strong medium to
long staple (ranging between 1-1/16 and 1-3/32) suited to modern spinning
methiods. The production pattern for the last five years has been as follows:

The main commodities derived from seed cotton are lint, cottonseed oil, and
cake. The high-quality lint is exported and the cottonseed is retained for
oil expression in i2alawi to meet the needs of an expanding domestic vege-
table oil market. Exports of lint have been as follows:

/1   Includes 2,000 tons exported to Rhodesia for spinning and re-imported
as yarn. Spinning capacity has now been increased sufficiently to
meet local requirements for the next five years.
3.        The domestic market uses around 3,000 tons of cotton per annum,
and this market is expected to rise to 3,500 tons by 1975 and 5,000 tons
by 1980. Production of seed cotton is expected to increase from its pres-
ent level of 25,000 tons to 42,000 tons and 63,000 tons, respectively. It
is estimated that Malawi would have an export surplus of high-grade cotton
of about 10,000 tons in 1975, and 15,000 tons in 1980. These exports would
be valued at around K 4.2 million and K 5.4 million in 1975 and 1980, re-
spectively, in term of 1972 currency value and would be exported to exist-
ing markets.
4.        The ginneries in Malawi have an annual capacity of about 45,000
tons, operating over a six- to seven-month period. The Bangula ginnery
has a capacity of around 35,000 tons, the Mitole ginnery, 6,000 tons, and
a standby ginnery at Chiromo could probably cope with 5,000 tons. ADM4ARC
and the British Cotton Growers' Association (BCGA) have agreed to form a
joint company (51% BCGA and 49% ADMARC) to take over the Bangula ginnery
and a new ginnery is planned at Liwonde in 1975. The new ginnery would have
a capacity of around 30,000 tons. The Bangula and the new ginneries would
handle all of the Malawi seed cotton crop anticipated for the early 1980's.
5.        Cottonseed oil expressing is carried out by NOIL with a current
capacity of 18,000 tons annually. The future capacity requirement will
be 26,000 tons and 40,000 tons in 1975 and 1980, respectively. If NOIL does
not expand its capacity, surplus cottonseed will have to be exported. The
oil extraction efficiency of NOIL is currently running at only 11.5%, but the
improved machinery now being installed will raise the extraction rate to 15%.
Cotton Prices
6.        Quotations for Malawi cotton C.I.F. London are not available, but
estimated c.i.f. prices are close to those for Mexico strict middling 1-1/16

details of buying expenses and the estimated economic value.
Maize
7.        Maize is the prime food staple and total production in Malawi
is estimated at between 1.1 and 1.4 million tons per annum. Purchases by
ADMARC over the past five years were:

ANNEX 15
Page 4
8.        The project area has a maize deficit and the larger production
resulting from the project would replace some of this. Maize surpluses in
Malawi may fall short of the national maize targets, which aim at a surplus
of 7% above self-sufficiency requirements. to allow for poor years. In view
of the wide differences that exist between export and import prices - due
to Malawi's land-locked location - the economic value of maize should re-
flect both values. In the last 10 years, Malawi exported maize in nine and
imported in one. Assuming this pattern for the future, an economic value
at farm gate has been calculated in Table 2.
Groundnuts
9.        The Malimba variety grown in the Shire Valley is a smaller but
more regularly shaped nut than the Chalimbana (the principal export nut).
Though Malimba is also a quality confectionery nut, it is not as distinc-
tive as the Chalimbana and would thus be competing with similar confection-
ery nuts. ADMARC sales forecasts indicate that this nut would therefore
sell at a discount of about 15% as compared with Chalimbana.
10.       Export of groundnuts from Malawi during the past five years has
declined in quantity but increased in unit value. The United Kingdom is
currently the main purchaser but the Federal Republic of Germany could
become an important market, provided the quality control demanded can be
achieved. Exports are shown below:

11.       Price forecasts for edible groundnuts of similar quality to the
Malimba nuts range from f 110 per ton C.I.F. UN in 1974 to E 98 per ton in
1980. These prices are used in Table 3 to derive a net value per ton.
Rice
12.       During the past five years, the annual marketed production of
paddy handled by ADMARC has ranged between 2,262 tons and 20,000 tons:

In addition to these purchases, there is a sizeable internal market that is
not channeled through ADMARC, estimated at 4,500 tons in 1968. Domestic
demand from all sources is, however, not expected to exceed 10,000 tons by

1980. The incremental production of paddy resulting in Year 5 of the project
would amount to 5,460 short tons and would consist of Faya and Blue-bonnet
long grained "indica" types suitable for export. Exports of milled rice have
quadrupled during the past five years, as shown in the following table:

13.       Malawi will have substantial rice surpluses for export during the
latter half of the 1970's and early 1980's. Although exports to neighboring
countries can be expected to decline as a result of increased production in
these countries, the Republic of South Africa will continue to be a large
importer. South African imports have grown during the past six years at an
annual percentage rate of around 3.3%, reaching a level of 100,000 tons in
1971, about 80,000 tons of which were husked, parboiled rice. Annual pro-
duction in the South African Customs Union 1/ is not expected to exceed
16,500 tons of paddy. South Africa is likely to be a net importer of
90,000 to 95,000 tons per annum. The good relations that MIalawi maintains
with South Africa have led to the granting of special conditions for rice
imports under a trade agreement 2/, which is subject to review after three
years.
14.       American rice (similar to the rice from the project area) probably
will maintain a premium over Asian varieties, and their prices will follow
world market trends. The projected prices for parboiled rice F.O.B. per
metric ton American ports range from US$155 to US$170 for 1974 and 1980,
respectively. These price ranges are used in Table 4 to determine prices
for paddy.
Beef Cattle
15.       The national cattle herd was 0.5 million head in 1971 and per
capita consumption of meat was 10 lb, of which about 3.5 lb was beef.
Higher per capita consumption levels are expected in the future.
16.       Cattle marketing is organized on a national basis through a net-
work of auction markets linked with stock routes leading to railheads and
abattoirs. The Cold Storage Company (CSC), a subsidiary of the Malawi De-
velopment Corporation, operates two abattoirs and cold storage plants at
Blantyre and Lilongwe and is the sole importer for the beef industry. It

is also obligated to purchase animals at floor prices in the absence of
other bidders. Slaughtering in the rural areas is mainly in the hands of
local butchers who sell the beef at recognized district markets under the
control of District Councils.
17.       Total cattle slaughter for the 1968-1971 period were as follows:
1967    %      1968    %    1969    %    1970    %    1971   %

1S.       The value of beef prodtuction on the project is based on the import
parity price for Standard/Commercial beef (Table 5). During the 1968-71, the
unit value C.I.F. Malawi border for standard/commercial carcasses (305 lb)
ranged between K 57 and K 63. The import parity price C.I.F. Malawi border
(in 1972 currency values) is projected at K 61 per carcass.

19.       During the five years 1967-71, the estimated annual landings of
wet fish in 1lalawi increased from around 16,000 tons to 40,000 tons. The
present level of production is estimated at some 44,000 tons and is largely
attributable to the recently introduced trawl fishing in Lake Malawi,
which has resulted in large catches of a hitherto unexploited species.
20.       Fish is the most important source of animal protein in the national
diec, the average per capita consumption being about 17 lbs per annum, five
times that of beef. Recorded fish exports have increased rapidly over the
past few years, giving Malawi a net export surplus of fish as follows:

21.       Fish production in the Lower Shire is currently estimated at
8,200 tons wet weight.  Consumption, at 37 lbs per capita, is double the
national average and accounts for 70% of total landings. The projected
fish production, consumption, and exports for the Shire Valley during the
next six years would be as follow:

Estimation of Net Value of Maize
The prices applied in the following analysis are derived from the
actual prices forecast by IBRD for maize C.I.F. UK in 1975
and 1980.
Actual prices forecast for 1975 C.I.F. UK per metric ton
US$ 54-65.
Actual prices forecast for 1980 C.I.P. UK per metric ton
US$ 59-71
Applying a 10% premium for white maize over yellow, the future
prices have been estimated (in relation to Malawi-quality maize) at:
1975 C.I.F. UK per metric ton US$ 59-70
1980 C.I.F. UK per metric ton US$ 65-78

When calculating the import price ior maize C.I.F. F,alawi, it has been
assumed that C.I.F. Beira and C.I.F. UK are interchangeable, and a mid-point
price of Ki6 per ton has been applied.

SHIRE VALLEY ILGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Rate of Return Calculation
Assumptions
1.        Table 1 shows the annual costs and returns used in calculating
the economic rate of return from investments in cotton, maize, rice, and
groundnut crops, together with livestock and fisheries.
2.        The following assumptions have been used in the calculations:
(a)  Project Life.  The economic life of the project is assumed
to be 20 years from project Year 1. The benefits from
individual farms relate to Years 2 through 20.
(b)  Costs
(i)  Contingencies.  Since benefits have been based on
projections in terms of 1972 currency values, no
price contingency is included. Physical contingencies
of 5% of capital costs have been allowed.
(ii) Medium-term Inputs. These include the subsidy element for
sprayers.
(iii) Capital Costs. These are carried forward from Year 6
through Year 20 on an average annual cost basis amounting
to K 40,714.
(iv) Recurrent Costs. For Years 6 through 20, provision is
made for the cost of maintaining field staff and
infrastructure services at a level considered necessary
to maintain satisfactory crop and livestock production.
(v)  Transportation.  Transport costs were accounted
for as one of the cost components in arriving at
the estimated economic values derived for produce
in Annex 7.
(vi) Health Services. Costs of health services are
incorporated in the economic costs and the total
capital and recurrent costs have been applied.



ANNEX 17
Page 2
(vii) Farm Labor. Farmers on the project are subsistence
farmers and practically all the labor used will be
family labor with little opportunity of employment
for cash wages. Family labor is costed at zero; an
element of hired labor is costed to rice production
at the local minimum rate of 23 tambala per day
(Annex 2, Table 5), and also in the fisherman's budget
(Annex 4, Table 1).
(viii)  Research.  50% of research costs have been attributed
to the project on the assumption that half the program
relates to dryland farming and fisheries, with the
balance to irrigation and work which has no direct
bearing on the project.
(c) Benefits
(i)  Acreages and Crop Yields.  The incremental production
deriving from the project is based on data given in
Annex 2, Table 3.
(ii) Livestock and Fisheries. The incremental production
is based on assumptions and projections given in Annexes
3 and 4, respectively.
(iii)  Returns have been estimated by using the economic
values derived in Annex 15 and expressed in terms of
1972 currency values.
(iv) The residual value of the oxen herd s estimated to
be K 150,000 in Year 20. The incremental value of
the cattle herd in Year 20 is estimated to be K 435,000.
Rate of Return
3.        On the basis of the cost estimates, yields, and the average
commodity prices assumed and applied over 20 years, the rate of return to
the economy from investment in the project, including related health services,
transportation, and research would be bout 22% (Table 1). If the costs of
health services are excluded, the rate of return increases to around 26%.
Sensitivity Analysis
4.        The overall rate of return was tested for sensitivity at various
cost and revenue levels. The return is most sensitive to variations in
cotton and maize revenues since these commodities account for the major
share of the project benefits.
5.        With the total cost of health services included, a 10% increase
in costs, accompanied by a 10% decrease in revenues, would give a ate of
return of about 13.8%.

/1   B1 - relate to benefits derived from the cotton
crop.
/2   B2 - relate to benefits derived from the maize
crop.
7.        On the assumption that the project achieves only 75% of the
"improved farmer" target of 16,300 during the five-year period 1973-1978
and that:
(a)  seasonal and medium-term inputs decline proportionately,
capital and recurrent costs being unaffected; and
(b)  benefits decline proportionately by 25%,
the rate of return falls to around 15%.
8.        On an alternative assumption that the project achieves its target
of 16,300 "improved farmers" but that this is delayed until Year 7 and that:
(a)  seasonal and medium-term inputs decline by 25% in
Years 1 to 5, by 12-1/2% in Year 6, and reach the 100%
level in Year 7; and
(b)  benefits are reduced by 25% in Years 2 to 6, by 12-1/2%
in Year 7, from when they run at 100%,
the rate of return falls from 22% to about 19%.
9.        An analysis of the foreign exchange costs and benefits resulting
from the project based on economic costs and revenues applied in the rate
of return analysis, gives the following results (in US$'000) for various
stages of the project:
