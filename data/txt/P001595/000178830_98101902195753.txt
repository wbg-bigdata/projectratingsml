INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPNENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO MALAWI FOR A
SECCND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN
THE SHIRE VALLEY
1.          I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Malawi for the equivalent of US$10.5 million on standard
IDA terms to help finance a second agricultural development project in the
Lower Shire Valley. 1/
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.          A report, "The Current Economic Position and Prospects of Malawi"
(AE-5a), was distributed to the Executive Directors on December 12, 1969 and
an updating memorandum, "Recent Economic Developments - Malawi" (AE-17) on
August 27, 1971. An economic mission visited Malawi in August 1972, and its
report is expected to be distributed shortly.
3.          Since independence in 1964, Malawi's economy has grown on the average
by about 7% a year. The economy is highly dependent on agriculture and changes
in weather lead to large annual fluctuations in production. For example, GDP
decreased in real terms in 1968 but increased by 13 percent in 1971. M-th a
per capita GNP of about $90, Malawi is a very poor country and is included in
the United Nations list of least developed countries.
A substantial savings and investment effort and generally efficient
management of the economy have ccntributed to economic growth in the past. At
independence, domestic savings were negligible and gross domestic investment
was 8.7% of GDP. By 1971, domestic savings had increased to 8% of GDP and
gross domestic investment to 19% of GDP, leaving a resource gap of US$43
rillion.
5.          A significant improvement in the financial position of the
Government has contributed to this overall improvement in savings performance.
At independence, the Government was able to finance only about half of its
recurrent expenditures from local resources. The deficit was met by grants
and loans from the U.K. Between 1964 and 1971, however, improvements in tax
administration and some changes in the tax system caused domestic revenue to
rise by 15% a year, whereas the average annual increase in recurrent expenditure
was only 7%. Consequently, the deficit in the recurrent budget diminished
steadily, and the Government hopes to eliminate it altogether by 1974. In 1970,
the Government introduced a three-year rolling program for the recurrent
budget, which stipulates expenditure ceilings for the various Mnistries.
1/ The cost estimates and financing plan in this report and in the Appraisal
Report have been calculated on the basis of exchange rates ruling prior to
February 12, 1973. The possible effect of the recent parity changes on
project costs expressed in US dollars does not appear at this time to be
substantial and no increase in the amount of the credit is proposed.



6.          The Government has increased its outlay for development at the
average rate of 30% annually in recent years with heavy emphasis on agriculture
and transportation. Since 19bc, a number of large agricultural schemes,
incorporating inputs, marketing and some infrastructure, were started near
Salima (with German aid) and near Lilongwe, Chikwawa and Karonga (with IDA
credits). Investments in transportation included the construction and
improvement of roads and emphasized the opening up of the central and northern
regions of the country. The rail link to Nacala in Mozanbique, completed in
1970, has provided a second cutlet to the sea. Since 1969, the construction
of a new capital at Lilongwe has taken up about 10% of the Government's
development expenditures.
7.          The Government sets out its planned expenditures on specific
projects and the anticipated sources of finance in a three-year rolling
program. The current program 1972/73 to 1974/75 envisages expenditures of about
US$38 million per annum, which is close to the average level attained in the
previous two years.
8.          In order to guide its economic policies and objectives in the
various sectors, the Government published at the end of 1971, a Statement of
Development Policies. This contains projections for 1975 and 1980 for all
important economic indicators and shows the direction in which the economy is
likely to move in the 1970s.   An average annual growth rate of the economy of
8% is projected. Whilst this is more than the growth achieved between 1964
and 1971 (7%), it is probably not too optimistic if account is taken of the
Government's past investment in projects with a long gestation period, some
of which are now beginning tc bear fruit. The Statement acknowledges that
with the country' s resource endowment, development strategy should continue
to concentrate on raising the productivity of small farmers, It envisages
public sector investment during the decade of $4L0 million, L/ mostly for
infrastructure, such as transport ($130 million), public utilities ($75
million) and the new capitaL city ($60 million0    $90 million is allocated to
agriculture and $70 million to social services (education, health, housing).
Private capital formation is estimated at about $4T0 million, of which about
10% would be in the non-monetary sector.
9.          The large size of private capital formation envisaged shows that
the private sector is expected to continue to play an important role in
economic development.  Outside agriculture, local private capital is now
concentrated in small enterprises mainly in rural trade and transport. Because
of lack of resources, the Government has until now not actively promoted
small-scale business in manufacturiLng. Large-scale business is dominated by
foreign-owned enterprises whicn have found a favorable investment climate in
10.         The Statement of Development Policies envisages that tho improvement
in the mobilization of domestic resources wi11 ccntinue and that by 1980, 60%

- 3 -
of total investment would be financed from domestic savings as compared to
44% in 1971. This would imply a slight narrowing of the resource gap in
absolute terms to about $40 mdllion by 1980. The Government expects that
public savings which have been negative in the past, may amount to about 17% of
total domestic savings in 1980; in this event, they would finance about 20%
of public sector investment. In addition, borrowing from the local private
sector would finance about 22% of public investment in 1980. The public
sector's requirements of foreign capital would then amount to 58% of public
investment in 1980, or about  US$300 million during the decade, equivalent to about
65% of the public sector's investment program. This would considerably exceed
the foreign exchange component of projects suitable for external financing.
External aid should, therefore, also cover a substantial portion of local
cost.
11.         At the end of 1971, Malawi' s external public debt totalled $176
million of which $140 million was disbursed. Debt service in that year amounted
to $6.3 mrillion or about 8% of export earnings. If we assume that the terms
of new debt to be contracted during the next few years will be similar to
those in the past (at a discount rate of 10% past lending terms represented a
grant element of about 58%), the debt service ratio would reach about 15% by
the end of the decade. The Government is aware of the need for careful
management of its finances, and is determined to keep the borrowing on hard
terms to a minimim. In view of its low per capita income Malawi should
receive the bulk of its external finance on very soft terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
12.         Malawi has to date received seven IDA credits totalling $17 million.
Four credits representing $24 million or slightly more than half of total
lending have been for agriculture. The other three credits have been for
highways ($11.5 million), education ($6.3 million) and power ($5.25 million).
There have been no Bank loans or IFC investments. Annex II contains a
summary statement of IDA credits as of January 31, 1973 and notes on the
execution of on-going projects. Project execution is generally satisfactory.
13.         The priority which the Bank Group in its lending is giving to
agriculture conforms to Malawi's development requirements and objectives. In
this respect, the basic approach followed since 1968 in the light of experience
gained on pilot projects set up with assistance from the United Kingdom, has
been to focus on integrated rural development with particular emphasis on small-
holder agriculture. All IDA-financed projects for agriculture so far, as well as
the proposed Second Shire Valley Project, have been in support of schemes of this
kind. This approach has been particularly successful and the Government intends to
continue to attach priority to raising the productivity of small farmers. IDA's



- i -
program of assistance to Malawi would continue to emphasize assistance for
increasing agricultural production and employment.
14.        The other three IDA-financed projects reflect Malawi's need to
develop its infrastructure. Projects for IDA financing are being prepared in
power, education and transportation. A second power project to increase
generating capacity and to expand the country's transmission and distribution
network was appraised in February. In education, IDA is currently financing
under Credit 102-MIA, a study of the country's education needs. Based on this,
a project is expected to be ready for IDA financing towards the end olf the next
fiscal year.  In transportation, the Bank is acting as executing meency for a
UNTDP-financed feasibility study of two roads in the central part of the country,
,while engineering of an additional road in the Shire area is included in the
proposed project. Finally, the Bank is also acting as execu-ting agency for a
UNDP-financed study of a forestry/papermill scheme, which might also lead to
eventual Bank Group financing
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN MATAWI
15.         Agriculture is the principal sector in the economy of Malawi.   It
accounts for over half of total output and provides employment for practically
all the population of the country.   In addition, agricultural commiodities
account for about 90E of the country's export earnings and provire raw
materials for domestic industries. During 196h1-1.971, the growth rate of
agricultural production has been 5.9%` annually.
16.         W.hereas maize, cotton, pulses and groundnuts are grown throughout
the country, cotton and tea are produced mainly in the south, tobacco, ground-
nuts and pulses in the central region, and rice in the ncrth. Maize is the
principal subsistence crop. Surplus quantities are marketed, some directly
to shopkeepers and the rest to the Agricultural Development and Marketing
Corporation (ADMARC), a parastatal body which has statutory monopoly rights
to purchase all major crops grown on smellholdings at prices fixed by it.
ADMARC purcha.ses farm inputs in bulk for smaliholders throughout the country
and distributes them through its depots.
17.         Prior to 1967, the growth of agricultural production had been
achieved largely throunh expansion of acreage.   Increasing scarcity of
suitable land and the large investments required to open up new land led
to a shift of emphasis towards achieving rapid increases in productivity
on areas already lmder cultivation, and by rehabilitation of land that had
been neglected in previous years. Increased production -was accompanied by a
gradual monetization of the agricultural sector. This transition towards a
cash economy has been particularly accelerated by the implementation of integ-
rated rural development schemes.



18.         Malawi's cattle, most of which are held in small privately owned
herds, are estimated at only abou-b 500,000 head. The cattle population is
increasing by about 3 percent per year. Beef fattening is carried out mainly
in the southern and central regions which are near the main consumption centers.
Consumption has more than doubled since 1965. It presently stands at about
60,000 head per annum.
19.         There are shortages of staff in the agricultural services in
Malawi, and existing training facilities will not be able to elininate the
shortage within the near future. The Bunda College of Agriculture - a part of
the University of Malawi - will produce shortly about twelve graduates per
year, so that many of the professional posts will continue to be held by
expatriates during the next few years. Technical assistants are trained in the
Colby College of Agriculture which has an annual output of about 125. This is
inadequate and Government is considering the creation of a national resources
college to fill the need.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
20.         A report entitled "Malawi: Shire Valley Agricultural Development
Project - Phase III', No. 33a-MAI dated February 15, 1973 is being circulated
separately. A credit and project summary is provided in Annex III and the
project area is shoun in detail in the second map (No. IBRD-l0ll4).
21.         The project which was prepared as an extension of the scheme
financed by Credit No. 114-MAI, was appraised in the field in June 1972.
Negotiations were held in Washington fram January 29 to February 2, 1973. The
Malawi Gavernment's delegation was headed by Mr. G.E. Gondwe, Permanent
Secretary, Ministry of Finance.
22.         The Shire Valley, a somewhat isolated area, is located
in the southwestern corner of Malawi. at an altitude of 500 feet above sea
level.  It is inhabited by 300,000 people representing almost 6% of Mllawils
total population.  Population density at the Valley bottom, where most people
live, is about 400 persons per square mile. The development of the Shire Valley
had, until about the mid-1960s, been neglected because of adverse climatic and
health factors.  In 1968, an application was submitted to IDA which led to
assistance in the financing of a US$4.6 million project principally aimed at
increasing crop production, mainly cotton, on about 130,000 acres of farmland in
the Valley. This project, executed over five years, also provided the
essential infrastructure needed for this development. Progress has been very
satisfactory and the project is expected to be canpleted ahead of schedule,
with lower   costs and greater benefits than projected at appraisal.
23.         This first phase, however, was largely confined to the area of
Ngabu (see maps), and its impact elsewhere in the Valley has been limited. The
proposed project, which would also be executed over a period of five years,
would consist of an extension and intensification of the Phase I project and would
place primary emphasis on increasing crop yields on already cultivated land.
The project is expected to enable about 16,000 farmers to adopt improved



methods of cultivation and would also include a livestock and fisheries
component. The project would. consist of the following major elements:
(a)   Extension Services
Extension services would be intensified through employ-
ment of additional extension staff, the establishment of
six area headquarters comprising offices, stores and training
facilities, the expansion of existing facilities including
the expansion of the training center at Ngabu project head-
quarters to provide residential quarters for farmers
undergoing training. The project would also include the
provision of vehicles and teaching, demonstration and other
related agricultural equipment.
(b)   Physical Infrastructure
The project would include the drilling and equipping of
about 140 boreholes to provide water for domestic use, crop
spraying and livestock watering;  the improvement of about
80 miles of main and secondary roads by constructing
culverts and bridges; the construction of about 100 miles
of feeder roads and the conversion of a railway bridge in the
lower Valley to enable its use by road traffic as well; the
construction of 17 markets and the renovation of three
existing ones.
(c)   Livestock Development
Two grazing schemes would be established and firelines,
tracks, dipping tanks, weirs and dams would be constructed.
Three oxen training centers would be established.
(d)   Fisheries
A program would be designed to raise the productivity of
about 1,000 fishermen, representing about 40% of the people
deriving the major part of their livelihood from fishing in
the rivers and marshes of the Valley. This program would be
carried out mainly through extension services, improved
fishing gear, the construction of 50 smoke-drying kilns, and
of about 20 miles of all-weather access roads.
Eatension staff would assist boat builders in constructing
simple boat-yards.
(e)   Credit
Credit would be provided to farmers and fishermen to
cover the purchase of seasonal inputs such as



- 7 -
insecticides, fertilizers and seeds and medium-term
credit for cotton sprayers, fishing boats, inproved fishing
gear and work oxen. Revolving funds would be set. up and
requirements would be made available in kind.   Mkdium-terrr
credit would carry interest at a rate of 10% per annum
while seasonal credit would bear a flat charge of 10% which
is equivalent to about 12% per annum.
(f)   Research and Studies
Existing research stations in the Lower Shire Valley
would be strengthened through the provision of additional
staff, building and equipment. Research would be conducted
on irrigated and rainfed crops. Fish culture trials would
also be conducted and a study would be carried out to
determine the feasibility of establishing controlled lagoons
for intensive low cost fish farming.
(g)   Health Services
In accordance 4rith Malawils 15-year health program,
additional services, mainly preventive, would be provided to
bring the level of services in the project area to that of the
rest of the country. This would include the establishment
and equipping of four primary health centers, eleven sub-
centers and sixteen health posts. In addition, insecticides
and molluscicide,s would be provided to help combat malaria
and bilharzia which are prevalent throughout the project area.
(h)   Land Registration
Mbst land in Malawi is held under customary tenure.
Project management would encourage project farmers to apply
for title to the land they tend. The project would provide
the necessary staff and equipment to assist in the
preparation for land registration.
(i)   W[ldlife Protection
Existing game parks in the area would continue to be
reserved to help preserve wildlife, including a rare species
of antelope. Facilities to effect greater control of
poaching would be expanded by the provision of staff houses
and the constructicn of roads and tracks.
24.         The project would be managed by the Project Manager at present in
charge of the first phase, under the general direction of the Permanent Secretary,
Ministry of Agriculture & Natural Resources. A staff consisting, in addition
to the Project Manager, of 11 professional and technical officers and 51
technical assistants is already in post under the first project. The project
would be administered from the present headquarters at Ngabu in the center of
the Shire Valley.  Mlawi Railways, under the Ministry of Transport and
Communications, would be responsible for the conversion of the railroad bridge



and ADMARC would carry out the construction of markets. As several Ministries
have responsibilities concerning the project, a liaison committee would be
established under the Chairmanship of the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry
of Agriculture & Natural ResuLrces to ensure coordination between project staff
and the organizations concerned.
25.         Total project costs are estimated at US$13.5 million net of taxes
with an estimated foreign exchange component of US$6.8 million. The proposed
credit of US$10.5 million would finance 78% of the total cost of the projec-t.
The balance of the project cost would be provided partly by the Malawi
Government ($1.7 million) in the form of annual budgetary allocations over a
period of 5 years and by ADMARC ($1.3 million) to finance the cost of markets
and 60% of seasonal credit. The conclusion of an agreement between the
Government and ADMARC to that effect would be a condition of effectiveness.
26.         Procurement of vehicles, machinery, equipment and fertilizers
amounting to about US$2.7 million would be by international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines. To facilitate this procedure, bulk
orders for the items concerned would be prepared annually. All farm inpu-ts
would be handled by ADMARC including those procured by international competitive
bidding. Conversion of the railway bridge(US$0.5 million) would be executed
under the supervision of the 2Mlawi Railways after international competitive
bidding. Staff housing and building construction works estimated at about
US$2.3 million are too small and dispersed to attract international bidders and
competitive tenders would therefore be invited from local firms only. Bore-
holes (US$0.3 million) would be constructed by the Water Development Department
and earth works on the main and secondary roads and construction of feeder
roads (uS$D.4; million) would be executed by the Ministry of Works & Sipplies
with equipment to be financed from the credit. All tenders would be processed
by the Yalawi Central Tenders Board, whose procedures are suitable.   The
credit, would be disbursed against (a) 33% of total expenditures for seasonal
credit; (b) 100% of foreign expenditures for expatriate personnel and
consultant services; and (c) 100% of foreign expenditures if directly imported
or 85% of total expenditures.
27.         The project is expected to affect directly about 16,000 farmers and
about 1,000 fishermen. Most of the labor required for the implementation of
the project would be provided by the farm families in the project area who
live at subsistence level and are underemployed.
28.         Based on the Bank's price forecasts for main agricultural commodities
to be produced, the economic return of the Droject is estimated at about 22%.
In terms of the cash income expected to accrue to the participants, the impact
of the project will be considerable. Average annual net cash income per farm
family is expected to increase from about US$11 to about US$120, while
participating fishermen are expected to increase their annual net income from
about US$300 to over US$700.

Republic of MWlawi and the Reconmmndation of the Committee provided for in
Article V. Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
30.         The draft agreement conforms to the normal pattern for credits for
agricultural development projects.
31.         I am satisfied that the proposed credit would conply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit No. 102-MAI - Education:
The project, for which a credit of $6.3 million was signed in May
1967, cansists of the construction and equipping of one national primary teacher
training college and the provision of technical instruction facilities in 12
secondary schools. The project has been implemented satisfactorily, and
school premises have been in use for over a year. At the request of the
Government, the Closing Date wras extended from the original date of December 31,
1972 to June 30, 1973 to allow disbursement for the completion of construction
of the college, which was delayed by a change in site.
Credit 112-MAI - Highways:
This project, for which a credit of $11.5 million was signed in
February 1965, consists of the construction of the Zomba-Lilongwe road, a study
of road and rail transport in Yalawi and the refunding of engineering credit
S-2-MAI. Initial problems, due to the termination of a road construction contract
on account of unsatisfactory performance, necessitating the engagement of another
contractor, have been overcome and project works have been completed satisfactorily.
At the Government's request, the Closing Date -was extended from December 31, 1972
to December 31, 1973 to allow settlement of outstanding contractors claims.
Credit No. 113-MAI - Agriculture - Lilongwe Development Project - Phase I:
This project, for which a credit of $6.0 million was signed in
February 1968, covered the first four years of a 13-year program for the
integrated development of agriculture on about 1.1 million acres of land around
Lilongwe. Field development was completed somewhiat ahead of schedule in
September 1971 and the Credit has been .fully disbursed.. All aspects of the
project have progressed satisfactorily and crop yields have been up to appraisal
estimates. Some 24h000 farmers are now taking up seasonal credit and repayments
have been in excess of 99%.
Credit No. ll4-MAI - Agriculture - Shire Valley Development Project:
This project, for which a credit of $3.7 million was signed in
February 1968, is almost complete and ahead of schedule. It is principally
aimed at increasing cotton production in the Shire Valley through the provision
of credit for insecticides, fertilizer, etc. Some 30,000 farmers are now using
improved cotton production methods and yields have been up to expectation.
Credit repayments have been of the order of 97%.
1/  These notes are designed to inform the &cecutive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not prLrport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

Credit No. 178-MAI - Power:
The project, for which a credit of $5.3 million was signed in
January 1970, consists of a 3 mw diesel generation unit at Lilongwe and a 16
mw hydro-power station at Tedzani, transmission lines, equipment and staff
training. The project is nearing completion. Additional funds, amounting to
about $600,000 are required to cover cost overruns caused mainly by unexpected
rock conditions. The Government hopes to obtain these funds from bilateral
sources. The project remains the best choice among all possible alternatives
in spite of the cost overruns.
Credit No. 222-MAI - Agriculture - Lilongwe Development Project - Phase II:
This project, for wich a credit of $7.3 million was signed in
May 1971, is designed to add approximately 375,000 acres to the 500,000 acres
developed under the Phase I project. Physical execution of the project is
generally progressing satisfactorily. Project management is satisfactory
though some senior posts have recently become vacant and some difficulties
are being experienced in filling them.
Credit No. 282-MAI - Agriculture - Karonga:
The project, for which a credit of $6.6 million was signed in
January 1972, is the first phase of a long-run agricultural development scheme
in the Karonga area. It includes development of rice cultivation, dry-land
crop production, extension services, credit, health services and the
rehabilitation of freight service on Lake MIlawi. The Credit became
effective on August 14, 1972 and implementation is underway.
