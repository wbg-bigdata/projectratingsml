REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
BANCO NACIONAL DE PANAMA (BNP)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA
FOR A SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Banco Nacional de Panama (BNP) with the guarantee of the Republic of
Panama for the equivalent of US$8 million to help finance a livestock devel-
opment project. The loan would have a term of 14 years, including a five
year grace period, with interest at 8.5 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited the country in September/October 1975.
An "Updating Report on the Economy of Panama" (1066a-PAN) was distributed to
the Executive Directors on May 17, 1976. Country data sheets are attached as
Annex I.
3.        In the 1960's, the Panamanian economy expanded rapidly with limited
Government participation and an efficient use of investment. World trade
flourished during that decade and Panama was able to benefit from its unique
geographic location owing to liberal trade legislation, free use of the United
States dollar as the domestic currency, and the Colon Free Zone. The domestic
market offered opportunities for small-scale industrialization and there still
was much accessible virgin land that could be brought under production. The
situation changed in the present decade. There are fewer opportunities for
import-substitution. Further expansion of agriculture requires more capital
and specialized manpower, whether to improve yields and cropping patterns or
to extend the frontier to new, less accessible lands. The recession which
affected world trade in 1974-75 lowered the growth of the export-oriented
service sector, and the recovery since then has been slow, owing in part to
changing trade patterns as a consequence of the reopening of the Suez Canal.
Panama's open economy was also severely hit by the sharp rise in the cost of
imports, particularly fuels. Net of exports of refined petroleum products,
Panama's petroleum import bill rose from 1 percent of GDP in 1973 to 3 percent
in 1975, and from 4.2 percent of non-petroleum imports to 14.1 percent in the
same period. Finally, these unfavorable developments were compounded by the
end of a private construction boom in high income housing and office buildings,
and by a severe drought in 1976. As a result, the rate of GDP growth, which
had averaged 8 percent per year in 1959-71, has been falling steadily to 1.7
percent in 1975 and to an estimated 1.0 percent in 1976. This prolonged
slowdown is particularly serious because population is growing at an annual
rate above 3 percent. Although the recorded rate of open unemployment has

of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.

increased only from 6.8 percent of the labor force in 1972 to 7.2 percent in
1976, unofficial estimates of unemployment which include workers who abandoned
the search for a job suggest an increase from 7.5 percent in 1972 to 12.9
percent in March 1976.
4.        The retrenchment of private investment which occurred in 1974-76
(not only in construction) has reflected, in addition to a response to the
recession, concern regarding the implementation of the 1972 Labor Code. Some
provisions of the Labor Code were believed to have led to increased absenteeism
and reduced productivity. Private investment has also been held back by what
was perceived to be slow progress in the negotiations with the United States
on a new Panama Canal Treaty. On balance, private investment fell from 21.8
percent of GDP in 1971 to 16.1 percent in 1975, and is estimated to have
dropped further to 11.3 percent in 1976.
5.        The Government has responded to the slackening of economic growth
by formulating a short-term program to reactivate the economy and a longer
term development strategy, embodied in the draft National Development Plan,
1976-80. The Government's short-term program includes (a) incentives equiv-
alent to 20 percent of value added for non-traditional exports; (b) a scheme
to guarantee commercial bank mortgage loans for low and middle-income housing
and a facility to rediscount these loans after eight years; (c) lowering of
commercial banks' capital and reserve requirements; (d) fiscal incentives to
promote investment, including accelerated depreciation, investment credits and
income tax exoneration for reinvested corporate profits; and (e) special
income tax deductions for firms hiring additional low-income workers. The
Government has recently modified the Labor Code, making its provisions more
flexible. Collective wage contracts have been extended for two years; during
this period there are to be no collective demands for new benefits and labor
conflicts will be resolved through compulsory arbitration.
6.        The Government has offset the drop in private investment by in-
creasing public investment sharply. Aggregate investment fluctuated around 28
percent of GDP during 1971-76 in spite of the sharp drop in private investment,
as public investment increased from 6 percent of GDP in 1971 to 11.9 percent
in 1975 and an estimated 16.9 percent of GDP in 1976. The volume of public
investment planned for the rest of the decade is twice as large in constant
terms as in the 1971-75 period. It includes a number of large projects in
infrastructure and in directly productive investment aimed at taking advan-
tage of the country's potential for providing services to international trade
-- including expansion of the successful industrial and commercial complex in
the Colon Free Zone -- and at developing more intensively the country's
natural resources, including large copper deposits, the hydroelectric poten-
tial, and agriculture. The program should also open up new opportunities for
the private sector and improve income distribution further through better
infrastructure and social services for the lower income groups and through
complementary measures to increase the productivity of small-scale farmers.
The priorities of the public investment program are sound, but the timing of
outlays may have to be stretched out to allow for administrative and financial
constraints.



-3-
7.        A major expansion in social and economic programs began in 1968, and
total public sector outlays have risen steadily since then. The authorities
have made efforts to raise the level of public sector savings to finance these
programs. Several new taxes were adopted during the past few years, tax
administration improved and the growth of current outlays was restrained.
Nonetheless, public savings have not kept pace with investment outlays, and
the Government has relied increasingly on external borrowing, much of it from
commercial banks. In 1976, owing to a recession-induced B/. 32 million short-
fall in tax revenues, and although current outlays were held B/. 10 million
below budgeted levels, the Central Government had a B/. 21 million current
account deficit. This, together with higher than estimated capital transfers
from the Central Government to public sector enterprises, resulted in substan-
tial new borrowing. As of December 1976, the disbursed external public debt
amounted to US$854 million, almost four times more than five years earlier.
Panama has negotiated nine stand-by arrangements with the IMF. The last one
expired in November 1976. A new stand-by arrangement is being negotiated and
is expected to be finalized shortly.
8.        As a result of the high level of external debt and of the large
proportion of private bank credits (69 percent of total public debt in 1976),
the debt service obligations of the public sector have increased at a faster
rate than public savings. (The conventional ratio of debt service to export
earnings is not a meaningful indicator of creditworthiness in Panama where the
US dollar is the domestic currency.) The Government has been readily able to
refinance its commercial debt, but realizes that measures to ensure that
public savings grow faster than debt service obligations are required to
strengthen the public sector's creditworthiness. It has recently taken further
important steps to strengthen the Central Government revenue structure by
making it more responsive to economic growth; this includes the introduction
of a 5 percent value-added sales tax, increased taxes on beer, cigarettes,
liquor, gasoline, hotel services and on dividends. Tax administration has
been tightened and the growth of current outlays has been restrained. Public
sector consumption expenditures dropped from 14.8 percent of GDP in 1972 to
12.5 percent in 1975. Furthermore, electric power rates were modified as of
January 1, 1977, to yield a 12.5 percent increase in revenues and further
increases are taking place. Telephone rates have been doubled and water rates
raised by 30 percent. These increases are expected to reduce the need for
Central Government transfers to help finance the investments of the utilities.
Finally, the Government intends to carry out the public investment program
with flexibility and to adapt the timing of individual projects to changes in
its financial position.
9.        Although in recent years economic growth has been disappointingly
low, the Government has taken measures to minimize the adverse effects of the
recession on the lower income strata of the population. More than most Latin
American countries, it has addressed social ills that had been neglected for
decades and has succeeded in extending health and education services to the
rural population. In the period 1960-75, infant mortality was reduced from 58
to 34 per thousand, life expectancy at birth increased from 60.9 to 66.5
years, the primary school enrollment ratio rose by 20 percent and the income



- 4 -
share of the poorest 40 percent of the population rose from 13.4 to 15.2 per-
cent. As noted earlier, the authorities have compensated for the decline in
private investment and have formulated an ambitious investment program. How-
ever, the Government's ability to pursue anticyclical policies is limited
by the need for fiscal prudence. In this respect, serious efforts have been
made to raise public sector savings at a time when both recession and infla-
tion add to the pressures to spend, and make tax and utility rate increases
difficult. Panama is creditworthy for lending on conventional terms provided
that the authorities continue to take measures required to ensure that the
growth of public borrowing remains manageable. In view of the high level and
relatively unfavorable structure of the public sector debt, Panama should make
a special effort to obtain external loans on better than commercial terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
10.       The Bank has to date made twelve loans to Panama totalling US$154
million.  Of these, five loans for US$18 million, are fully disbursed (two
for roads totalling US$13 million; two for agriculture totalling US$1
million, and one for power for US$4 million). Ongoing projects include a
power generation project for which the Bank lent US$42 million in 1970; an
airport project (Tocumen International Airport) for which the Bank lent
US$20 million, and a fisheries credit project for which the Bank lent
US$3.4 million, both in 1971; a livestock credit project for which the Bank
made a US$4.7 million loan and a power transmission project for which the Bank
made a US$30 million loan both in 1973; and a fishing port project for which
the Bank made a US$24 million loan in 1975. The most recent operation, a
US$12 million loan to finance a water supply and sewerage project, was
approved by the Executive Directors in May 1976. Execution of Bank-financed
projects has, on the whole, been satisfactory, although substantial delays and
cost overruns have occurred particularly with respect to the airport and power
projects. While the major causes of delay have been overcome, the cost
overruns created financial problems in the case of IRHE, the power company.
The Government and IRHE have initiated a program of substantial tariff
increases which will improve IRHE's financial position.
11.       IFC has made one investment in Panama:   a commitment in 1971 to
acquire UlS$0.3 million of equity in the Corporacion de Desarrollo Hotelero S.A.
and to lend to the Corporacion US$1.2 million to build a new international
hotel. This project was satisfactorily completed and the hotel is open to
business. Annex II contains a Summary Statement of Bank loans and IFC invest-
ments as of January 31, 1977, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
12.       Bank lending to Panama is designed to support the Government's devel-
opment strategy particularly as regards the development of Panama's dynamic
service industries and the diversification of production and exports.
Specifically, the Bank's assistance is oriented towards those sectors in



which it can make a special contribution in terms of policies and institu-
tions, removing infrastructure bottlenecks and utilizing the country's
natural resources. The present project would concentrate on the develop-
ment of Panama's dairy potential thereby helping medium and small-scale
farmers, and replacing imports. A Second Fisheries Project, which is also
being submitted for your consideration, would continue the modernization of
Panama's export-oriented fishing industry. The livestock and fisheries
projects thus aim primarily at assisting the Government in meeting its objec-
tive of diversifying production and exports. The La Fortuna hydroelectric
project, to be submitted for consideration of the Executive Directors by
mid-1977, is a fundamental component of the country's public investment
program, and will contribute to reducing Panama's heavy dependence on thermal
generation. Through the proposed loan for power development, the Bank will
continue to assist the power company in strengthening its organization, taxed
by the rapid expansion of services. In addition, the Bank is working with the
Government on a project designed to improve highway maintenance operations and
administration. We also expect to continue supporting the government's
program of expanding the water supply and sewerage facilities in the fast-
growing urban areas.
13.       The principal sources of official external financing to Panama in
the past are summarized as follows:

- 6 -
14.       Both USAID and IDB have lent heavily for agriculture and for social
services. This pattern is likely to persist as the Government prefers to
borrow on highly concessionary terms for those sectors, while utilizing assist-
ance received on harder terms for projects which are expected to result in
more immediate economic benefits. The IDB is also financing road construction
and tourism. In addition, the IDB is considering assistance in cooperation
with the Bank to finance Panama's hydroelectric power expansion program.
15.       The Bank's share of Panama's publicly guaranteed external debt. out-
standing and disbursed was 10.2 percent at the end of 1976 and the Bank's
share of public external debt service was 6.2 percent. Because of the high
levels of borrowing from commercial banks programmed by the Government, these
percentages are expected to drop by 1980 to 7.4 and 4.2 percent, respectively.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
16.       Agriculture is less important in Panama than in most other Latin
American countries. About one-third of the labor force derives its primary
income from agriculture (including fisheries), the sector's share in GDP was
only 17 percent (in current prices) in 1975, and its contribution to total
exports of goods and non-factor services in the same year was about 13 percent.
Bananas are the major agricultural product, representing 20 percent of total
agricultural output in 1975. In recent years, sugar has gained importance
and has become the second largest export crop (after bananas).
17.       Despite the relative smallness of the sector, agriculture continues
to receive much attention from the authorities for three main reasons. First,
there still is a serious problem of rural poverty: a recent government study
indicates that 40 percent of the rural population lives in extreme poverty,
which is defined as a total family per capita income of less than US$200.
Secondly, excluding revenues from the service sector, which is the largest
source of foreign exchange earnings, agriculture in 1975 provided about 50
percent of merchandise exports. Thirdly, with appropriate policies, the
sector could make a greater contribution to output, the balance of payments
and employment.
18.       Performance of the agricultural sector in the first half of the
seventies was modest. The rate of growth of the sector which averaged
5.3 percent in 1960-1970 dropped to 2.9 percent in 1970-75. Reflecting
government policies (discussed below) and trends in international prices, crop
production expanded more rapidly than livestock. Sugarcane and rice have been
the most dynamic elements of growth. In response to a steep rise in foreign
demand, sugarcane production grew from an average of 900 thousand tons in
1966-70 to 1.7 million tons in 1975. Similarly, rice production has shown a
steady increase from an average 110,000 tons in 1965-69 to 180,000 tons in
1976. By contrast, problems related to an export tax on bananas, established



- 7 -
in 1974, caused a decline in production and exports of this crop. Although
this issue has now been resolved, future growth of banana exports is con-
strained by weak foreign demand. The livestock subsector is discussed below.
Government Policies
19.       Since 1968, the Government's agricultural policies have sought
to improve the productivity and living standards of the rural population by
organizing small farmers into collective settlements (asentamientos) or
cooperatives, by providing them with land, abundant credit and technical
assistance, and by facilitating marketing of their crops. In support of
this policy, public sector institutions were strengthened and budgetary
allocations increased sharply. Public sector outlays for agriculture rose
from 1.1 percent of GDP in 1969 to 4.1 percent in 1974, an annual increase of
26 percent in real terms. Initially, these efforts were not oriented towards
increased production but rather towards land acquisition and settlement,
peasant organization and the provision of social and economic services such as
education, health and feeder roads. Between 1969 and 1972, the Government
purchased or expropriated (with compensation) 330,000 hectares--one-sixth of
the total land in farms in 1970.
20.       The emphasis on land redistribution created uncertainty among
medium and large scale farmers regarding their own tenure stability. Rein-
forcing private sector uncertainties, the authorities maintained price
ceilings on food staples which discouraged private investment in basic crops
(rice, corn and beans). Thus, production of these crops fell sharply in
1969-1972 (the drought of 1972 intensified the decline).
21.       Since 1973, the emphasis shifted towards the consolidation of
settlement efforts in lands already acquired and the expansion of production.
Between 1973 and the present, the Government has acquired less than 90,000
hectares, most of which in connection with a rural development project in the
sparsely-populated Bayano area of eastern Panama. In mid-1975, over 8,000
families remained established in 200 collective farms and 300 other coop-
erative units. Many collective farms have been successfully growing rice
in newly-cleared low land, using capital-intensive methods made possible by
the availability of subsidized government credit. In 1974/75 organized farm
groups produced nearly 25,000 tons of rice at an average yield of 2.2 tons
per hectare, 20 percent higher than the nationwide average yield. As part of
the efforts to increase production, the authorities have substantially in-
creased support prices and expanded their marketing activities. All these
measures brought about increases in the production of perishable vegetables,
a reversal in the declining trend of basic grains and a return to self-
sufficiency in rice. The state-owned Corporacion Azucarera La Victoria is
carrying out a major investment program to increase the output of sugar for
export. The area under sugar cultivation has increased from 24,000 hectares
in 1970 to 34,000 hectares in 1974, with the result that the 1974-1975 harvest
of 1.7 million tons was 20 percent higher than the previous year.



-8-
Agricultural Credit
22.       Panama has a well developed banking system which is dissimilar to
that of other Latin American countries: there is no central bank and foreign
banks devoted primarily to offshore banking predominate. There are five
government banks: the Banco Nacional de Panama (BNP), the Caja de Ahorros
(a savings bank), the Banco de Desarollo Agropecuario, (Agricultural Develop-
ment Bank - BDA), the Banco Hipotecario (a mortgage bank) and the Corporacion
Financiera Nacional (National Finance Corporation), a newly established
industrial development bank.
23.       By far the most important government bank is BNP.     It serves as
fiscal and fiduciary agent for the Government and is the country's largest
commercial bank. BNP is a competently run institution, but pressures on it
to expand its lending in the context of a recessionary economic situation led
to an increase in the level of loans in arrears, to a high level of borrowing
from commercial banks and to a decline in profitability. BNP is well aware of
these trends, and during 1976 took a number of measures designed to reverse
them. These include tightening loan collections and the reorganization of a
unit specialized in debt recovery as well as measures designed to reduce
operating costs. Most importantly, BNP has agreed with the Government of
Panama to limit its lending to the public sector, thereby enabling BNP to
graduate the increase in its overall lending to the growth of its deposits and
equity while concentrating its lending on the most profitable components of
the portfolio. BNP's financial situation has already improved as indicated by
a decline in the level of total arrears from 11.6 percent at the end of 1975
to 8.3 percent at the end of 1976.
24.       Although commercial bank deposits amounted to US$7,473 million as
of December 31, 1975, and the aggregate volume of commercial bank lending in
Panama was US$1,239 million, agricultural lending was only US$149.5 million in
1975. Most agricultural lending is short-term, to finance cattle purchases
and marketing of agricultural products. The only long term credit available
to agriculture is provided by BNP and the BDA, which together supplied about
17 percent of total agricultural credit in 1974, the last year for which data
on agricultural lending is available.
25.       Long-term agricultural credit has been supported by the Bank,
through BNP, and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), through the BDA.
While the IDB's line of credit for agriculture through BDA can be used to
finance long term investments in livestock, in practice it has largely been
used to finance crops, and in some instances the purchase of cattle for very
small farmers.
26.       The National Banking Commission, which is chaired by the Minister of
Planning and Economic Policy, has the power to fix maximum interest rates to
be charged on loans, but it has chosen to let market forces determine lending
rates. An exception was Decree Law 95 of 1974, which temporarily established
a ceiling of 8 percent and 9 percent, respectively, for long term agricultural
and industrial development loans. However, in the case of subloans under the



- 9 -
Bank's first livestock project, the interest rate remained ait 10 percent.
The ceilings established under Decree Law 95 were abolished in September 1976.
BNP currently charges about 11 percent for agricultural loans, plus a service
fee.
The Livestock Subsector
27.       Only 20 percent of Panama's territory is suitable for crop produc-
tion and only half of this is suitable for mechanized field crops. Within the
agricultural sector, livestock presents one of the better opportunities: 40
percent of the territory is classified as pasture land.
28.       In 1975, Panama had about 1.35 million head of cattle.    In the 10
years to 1971, the national herd grew at an average annual rate of about 4.9
percent; growth dropped in the 1971-75 period to less than 2 percent. Beef
production grew slowly from 34,400 tons in 1970 to an estimated 44,300 tons in
1974. Panama is free of foot-and-mouth disease, but its exports to the United
States are subject to a quota. Exports of beef reached a high of 2,400 tons
when world market prices were near their peak, but have subsequently declined.
Milk production dropped slightly from a peak of 73.5 million liters in 1971
to a low of 62 million liters in 1974, increasing again to 70 million liters
in 1975.
29.       Milk output has not kept up with the growth in domestic demand, and
Panama has had to depend increasingly on imports of milk and milk products to
supply the local market. The share of imported milk in total domestic supply
more than doubled in the period 1960-74, increasing from 32 to 77.5 million
liters. Milk imports in 1974 represented 54 percent of total domestic milk
supply. This is reflected in an import bill for milk and milk products of
US$10.6 million in 1974 (1.4 percent of merchandise imports). Because milk
can be competitively produced in Panama, the Government attributes high
priority to increasing output.
30.       There are several causes for the recent behavior of the livestock
subsector. First, the agrarian reform program of the early seventies brought
uncertainty to cattle farming that affected investment in the subsector.
Second, a severe drought in 1972-73 cut heavily into the herd numbers, espe-
cially breeding cows. Third, the upswing of the world market for beef in the
early seventies led to an increase in the extraction rate that also affected
the growth of the herds. Fourth, the Government has imposed partial embargoes
on beef exports to prevent shortages on the domestic market. The embargoes
and the fact that domestic prices have at times (1971-1974) been below the
international prices adversely affected the confidence of producers.
31.       A USAID study of public health, farm production, farm inspection
and quality control standards and pricing for milk was completed in September
1976,and its recommendations are being reviewed by the Government. The study
indicates that excessively high standards for farm buildings and the fact that
producers' prices are linked to the type of farm buildings and equipment rather
than directly to milk quality has proven the greatest disincentive to milk



- 10 -
producers. The Government has agreed to modify its laws and regulations
relating to milk quality, on-farm building standards, milk testing and farm
inspection programs in order to establish a uniform pricing policy for all
milk, which would recognize quality, such as fat content and bacterial count,
for grade and price fixing. The proposed modifications are a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed loan (draft Loan Agreement, Section 7.01).
32.       In view of the insufficient production of milk, and a prolonged and
severe drought in 1975/76, the Government increased the price of milk to
producers by an average of two cents per liter in September 1976. Prices at
farm gate are now 23 US cents per liter for grade A milk in Chiriqui Province,
the most important milk producing region, and 25 US cents per liter in the
central provinces. These prices are comparable to those in the United States.
Prices to producers of industrial milk vary from 16.5 US cents and 17.5 US
cents per liter, respectively, for the two areas. The proposed project is
designed to improve production standards so that project participants would
benefit from higher prices based on quality.
Performance Under On-going Livestock Development Project
33.       The objective of the first livestock project was to increase annual
production of beef by about 8,000 tons, of milk by about 7,000 tons and pro-
duction of 9,000 breeding animals. After only three years, it is not possible
to measure the full impact of the project in these terms; however, a limited
monitoring and data collection system has been set up which will yield the
necessary data to measure benefits. This system would be expanded under
the second project (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.10(c)). Disbursements are
40 percent behind appraisal estimates largely because of initial delays in
establishing the project unit. On December 31, 1976, 306 farm loans had been
made (including 5 asentamientos), and 90 percent of loan funds for farm
development had been committed. An additional 27 subloans were under study
and full commitment is expected in April 1977. Current lending is mainly for
small dairy and dual-purpose farms. The overall average loan size per farm
family is about US$15,000, compared to the appraisal estimate of US$16,500.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
34.       A report entitled "Appraisal of Second Livestock Project - Panama"
(No. 1378-PAN), dated March 14, 1977, is being distributed separately.
The main features of the loan and project are summarized in Annex III.
The project was appraised in June 1976.   Negotiations were held in Washington,
from February 14 to 17, 1977. The BNP and the Republic of Panama were repre-
sented by a delegation led by Mr. Roberto Barragan, Executive Manager for
Development of BNP.



Description
35.       The project is designed to increase the domestic supply of milk
in Panama through improvement of grassland production, better husbandry, and
upgrading or replacement of poor quality cattle. It is thus in line with the
Government's objective of reducing Panama's dependence on imported milk. The
project will also support the Government's rural development program by
financing and providing technical services for government-sponsored settle-
ments and for a government-owned experimental farm. The project consists
of:
(a) long-term financing of on-farm investment by small and medium-
sized producers primarily dedicated to milk production (whether
through specialized dairy or beef/dairy herds), and by asenta-
mientos and cooperatives established under the agrarian
reform program or other organized groups of farmers. It is
estimated that about 355 small and medium-sized farms and
20 groups of farmers would receive financing;
(b) long-term financing of on-farm investments in the livestock
operation of the Integrated Development Program of Rio Hato
(PRODEIRHA), a newly established state farm which serves as a
production and training center for farmers. PRODEIRHA is run
by both military and civilian technicians and operates as an
independent organization. The farm is under the responsibility
of the Ministry of Agriculture, and is located in land which is
part of the military base of Rio Hato; and
(c) provision of technical services, including (i) 60 man-months
of consulting services principally in animal fertility, soil
conservation and tropical pastures to assist the participating
farmers and the technical staff of the BNP; (ii) support of
the Technical Unit of BNP; and (iii) consulting services (2
man-months) to assist in the expansion and diversification of
the meat processing industry in Panama. A study on the feasi-
bility of developing the meat processing industry is now under
way.
36.       The Government has agreed to guarantee the repayment of the
PRODEIRHA subloan to BNP; to employ a technical manager for livestock
operations in PRODEIRHA who is satisfactory to the Bank, and to provide
PRODEIRHA with the required services and facilities to carry out the sub-
project. The Government has also agreed to cause PRODEIRHA to maintain
separate accounts for its livestock operations. Enactment of PRODEIRHA's
statutes and deposit by the Government of US$500,000 in a special account as
an initial counterpart contribution for the sub-project, would be conditions
for disbursement of the PRODEIRHA subloan. The Government's contributions to
PRODEIRHA would be in the form of equity. As cattle operations are new to
PRODEIRHA, the Bank would receive proof that the technical staff and physical



- 12 -
infrastructure required to handle cattle are available, and review the plans
for cattle import operation prior to disbursing for cattle purchases (Draft
Loan Agreement, Schedule I, paragraph 4; Schedule 4, Parts II B, and draft
Guarantee Agreement, Sections 3.02 and 3.03.)
37.       Execution of the project is expected to take five years:    subloan
commitments are expected to take three years and completion of disbursements
five years.
Project Administration
38.       The BNP, which has competently administered the first Livestock
Development Project and the first Fisheries Project, would administer the
project. The livestock Technical Unit, set up under the first Livestock
Development Project, would be responsible for project implementation. As
under the first project, the Technical Unit would report to the General
Manager of BNP (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.05(a)). The Technical Unit
would continue to be headed by a Project Director and to include an agricul-
tural economist, a dairy production specialist and an administrative officer.
In addition, there are 14 technicians providing advice at the farm level. The
present Technical Unit staff is competent and acceptable to the Bank. BNP
would submit to the Bank for approval the qualifications of any new profes-
sional personnel, or administrative officer and would increase the technical
staff assigned to field work from 14 to 20 (draft Loan Agreement, Section
3.06, (a) and (b)). The Credit Committee of BNP, on the recommendation of the
Project Director, would be responsible for approval of project subloans under
US$100,000. Subloans over that amount would also be approved by the Bank
(draft Loan Agreement, Schedule 4, Part II C).
39.       BNP would lend directly to project beneficiaries, and would keep a
separate project account which would be audited. In addition, BNP will have
its accounts audited by auditors acceptable to the Bank (draft Loan Agreement,
Sections 3.02 and 5.02). In the past, BNP has been audited by the Office of
the Controller General of the Republic, which has analyzed BNP's accounts in a
manner satisfactory to the Bank. It is expected that the Office of the
Controller General will continue to audit BNP.
40.        No financial intermediaries other than the publicly-owned BDA
participated in the first project, and it is not expected that commercial banks,
which engage primarily in short-term lending to large ranchers, would partici-
pate in the project. However, they are not precluded from participating. Any
participating financial intermediary would be required to enter into agreements
with BNP regarding on-lending criteria and audit of sub-project accounts, and
to employ qualified technicians for subloan analysis and supervision (draft
Loan Agreement, Sections 3.02, 3.03, and 5.03).

Cost Estimates and Financing
41.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$20 million.    A
detailed breakdown of costs is given in Annex III. Development of individual
farms, asentamientos, cooperatives or other organized groups of farmers, the
largest component of the project, represents 76 percent of project costs
(excluding contingencies); on-farm development of PRODEIRHA, 10 percent, and
technical services, 14 percent. The proposed loan of US$8 million would
finance the imported component of the project or 40 percent of total costs.
BNP would finance US$8 million or 40 percent; farm beneficiaries would contri-
bute US$3 million or 15 percent and the Government US$1 million or 5 percent,
as an equity contribution to PRODEIRHA.
42.       The estimated cost of the 62 man-months of consulting services to
be provided under the project (see item (c) of the project description above)
is US$320,000 or an average cost per man-month of approximately US$5,200
(excluding price escalation and contingencies). This average cost is con-
sidered reasonable given the type of expertise required.
Lending Arrangements
43.       The lending rate would be no less than 11 percent plus a service fee
of 0.5 percent for subloans in amounts of less than US$150,000 and 0.25
percent on subloans above that figure. This lending rate would be positive,
and consistent with the present lending rates for the agricultural sector in
Panama. Inflation in Panama has traditionally been low, and in line with
international trends. It is expected that in the near future inflation will
be no higher than 8 percent. The proposed rate would give BNP a spread of
approximately 3 percent on its subloans under the project, taking into account
that the average cost of money to BNP is 8.24 percent. The spread would cover
the administrative costs of the project. Subloans to farmers would be made on
terms of up to 12 years including up to 5 years of grace. The subloan to
PRODEIRHA would be for 12 years including 5 years of grace. The BNP has
agreed to finance on commercial terms working capital which may be required to
complement the long term investment (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.02 and
Schedule 4, Part II B). Should financial intermediaries decide to participate
in the project, BNP would on-lend to them at 9 percent, and they in turn would
lend to farmers at the same rates and on the same terms as BNP. Participating
financial intermediaries would also be required to finance on commercial terms
working capital to the participating farmers (draft Loan Agreement, Section
3.02 and Schedule 4, Part II B). To assist BNP in strengthening its finances,
the Guarantor would bear the foreign exchange risk for the Bank loan (draft
Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.06).
Procurement
44.       Because of the number of beneficiaries likely to be involved and
the variety of items to be procured, bulk purchases for farm loans would not
be feasible. Goods contained in farm plans would therefore be procured by
individual beneficiaries who would purchase their investment requirements



- 14 -
through existing commercial channels. Panama has a good network of suppliers
of agricultural inputs, competition is keen, and facilities for maintenance of
machinery and equipment are adequate. In the case of procurement of breeding
cattle for PRODEIRHA, international comparative shopping would be permitted.
This procedure is considered appropriate because the scope of bidding would be
narrow: the cattle involved would need to be of specific milking strains,
adaptable to tropical conditions, from countries free of foot-and-mouth and
other specified diseases.
45.       Vehicles and equipment for the use of project staff and consultants
would be procured through competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance
with local procedures or through comparative shopping, since the volume of
purchases is small and would be spread over the five years of project execu-
tion. Foreign firms are adequately represented in Panama and there are no
significant import restrictions which might affect procurement through local
channels (draft Loan Agreement, Section 2.03).
Disbursements
46.       The loan would be disbursed over a period of five years against the
foreign exchange component of the project, as follows: (a) 46 percent of
amounts advanced for farm development subloans; (b) 100 percent of amounts
advanced for the PRODEIRHA subloan; (c) 75 percent of all Technical Unit
costs; (d) 100 percent of the cost of consultant specialists in animal
fertility, tropical pastures and soils and in meat processing.
Economic Justification
47.       The overall rate of return of the project is estimated at 20 percent.
A sensitivity analysis indicates that if there were a shortfall in production
of 20 percent, the rate of return would fall to 12 percent. If, in addition,
costs would increase by 20 percent, the rate of return would be 10 percent.
48.       The project would have direct balance-of-payments and fiscal effects.
Since Panama is a net importer of milk, the additional domestic production
resulting from project-related investments would lead to savings of foreign
exchange by cutting down on imports. At full development, the estimated value
of the incremental output of milk, beef and breeding stock, at 1976 prices,
would be about US$9.5 million per year. The net foreign exchange savings of
the project at full development would be about US$6.2 million per year. A
further benefit to the country would come in the form of incremental returns
to the Government from taxes and fees, which are estimated to be of about
US$150,000 annually at full development.
49.        Direct beneficiaries of the project will number about 1,500 families
(equivalent to approximately 7,600 persons). Of the 1,500 families, some 355
live on their own farms; 560 families live in 20 asentamientos or other collec-
tive groupings and the remaining would be farm workers, who would obtain em-
ployment under the project. Of the total. about 1,300 families are presently
under the poverty line in Panama (defined for Panama as per capita family
income of less than US$200).

Risks
50.       There are no special technical, financial or marketing risks to the
success of the project. BNP is successfully carrying out two Bank-financed
credit programs, and there Is demand In the domestic market for the output to
be generated by the project. There is at present no foot and mouth disease
In Panama. With the assistance of the Inter-American Development Bank and the
Pan-American Health Organization, the Government is developing a broad program
to prevent the spread of foot-and-mouth disease once the Inter-American
highway connecting Panama with Colombia Is completed. The Government has
agreed to maintain policies deslgned to avoid the Introduction of foot and
mouth disease In Its territory (draft Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.05).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
51.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Banco Nacional de
Panama, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Panama and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of Annex IV. The
modification of laws and regulations so as to establlsh a uniform pricing
policy for milk which recognizes quality for grade and price fixing is a
special condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan (draft Loan Agreement,
Section 7.01). The enactment of the statutes of PRODEIRHA and the deposit by
the Government of counterpart funds for the sub-project are conditions of
disbursement for the PRODEIRHA subloan. In addition, prior to disbursing for
the purchase of cattle by PRODEIRHA, the Bank would review PRODEIRHA's overall
cattle Import operations and Its technical and physical Infrastructure for
cattle handling (draft Loan Agreement, Schedule I, paragraph 4).
52.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
53.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No. 661: Second Power Project; US$42 Million Loan of March 16, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
The project is almost completed with an expected 18-month delay for
the major component, the Bayano hydroelectric plant, which will reach full
output by mid-1977. The other major components, the Las Minas 40 MW unit and
associated transmission, have been commissioned. The project cost is now
estimated at US$96.6 million or 84 percent above appraisal estimates. Delays
in project execution resulted from shortage of materials and difficulties with
the contractor. The cost overruns are due mainly to larger than forecast
inflation in Panama and abroad during the project execution period, and con-
struction problems. The Bank has reached agreement with the Government and
IRHE, the power company, on cost overrun financing and tariff adjustments to
increase IRHE's revenues.
Loan No. 783: Tocumen International Airport Project; US$20 Million Loan of
August 2, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The project, which consists of construction of a new airport terminal
building, runway and auxiliary facilities for Panama City, is about 18 months
behind schedule and has had a 100 percent cost overrun. Delays in project
execution have resulted in large part from changes in design and bad weather
conditions at the beginning of construction which made earthworks difficult
to execute. The overrun is due to delays in project execution and inflation.
Runway paving and the construction of the terminal building are now progressing
satisfactorily,and the loan should be fully disbursed by the new Closing Date
of December 1977. The financial position of the borrower continues to be
strong in spite of the worldwide slowdown in international air transportation.
The shortfall in the project financing plan, caused by cost increases, will
be covered by additional government equity funds.
Loan No. 784: Fisheries Project; US$3.4 Million Loan of August 2, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
The project, which is designed to increase efficiency of the
Panamanian shrimp industry, consists of (1) construction of shrimp trawlers;
(2) a trawler captains' training program; and (3) a fishing port feasibility
study. The construction of trawlers is completed; however, the scope of the
Project had to be reduced from the originally intended 40 trawlers to 26
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

trawlers due to escalation of costs. The captains training program has also
been completed. The fishing port feasibility study was completed in February
1974, and led to the preparation of a project for which the Executive Directors
approved a loan in April 1975. As of January 31, 1977, the loan was 97
percent disbursed.
Loan No. 901: Livestock Development Project; US$4.7 Million Loan of
June 8, 1973; Closing Date:   December 31, 1978
The project finances cattle enterprises, including land reform
settlements, involved in dairying, beef breeding and fattening; and technical
services, including an ongoing study of the livestock potential in the Atlantic
Coast Region. As of December 31, 1976, the loan was 93 percent committed and
60 percent disbursed. The loan should be fully disbursed on schedule even
though commitments have lagged behind appraisal estimates, due mainly to
initial delays in organizing the project unit.
Loan No. 948: Third Power Project; US$30 Million Loan of December 4, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
The project is designed to integrate three of the four isolated
major regional electricity systems into a national grid. Project implemen-
tation is about 10 months behind schedule because of initial delays in engi-
neering, bidding, and procurement of major items--the 28 MW diesels, 230
kV lines, and substations. Project costs are currently estimated at 25
percent above appraisal estimates in large part due to inflation.
Loan No. 1114: Fishing Port Project; US$24 Million Loan of May 27, 1975;
Closing Date: September 30, 1979.
The project consists of construction of a new fishing port at Punta
Vacamonte on the Pacific. The first contract, for marine works, has been
awarded. It is expected that small delays which resulted during bidding will
be recovered in construction. Project costs are estimated at 26 percent above
appraisal estimates, but the project still yields an acceptable economic rate
of return.
Loan 1280: Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$12 Million Loan of
June 9, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
The project, which includes financing for improved water supply and
sewerage in the cities of Panama, Colon, Arraijan, Chorrera and Vacamonte,
and a metering program, is proceeding on schedule. Technical proposals for
the major design works have been received, and it is expected that final
selection of the engineering consulting firm to carry out this work will take
place this month. Detailed design of some components of the project has been
started by the Borrower, and it is also expected that construction will begin
in July. The metering program is expected to begin in July.

Borrower:                        Banco Nacional de Panama
Guarantor:                       Republic of Panama
Amount:                          US$8 million equivalent
Terms:                           Payable in 14 years, including 5 years of
grace, at an interest rate of 8.5 percent
per annum.
Relending Terms:                 BNP would lend to farmers, asentamientos, coop-
eratives or other organized groups of farmers
and PRODEIRHA at no less than 11 percent plus
a service fee of 0.5 percent for subloans of
less than US$150,000 and 0.25 percent for
subloans above that figure. Loans to farmers,
asentamientos, cooperatives or other groups of
farmers would be for up to 12 years, including
up to 5 years of grace. The loan to PRODEIRHA
would be for 12 years, including 5 years of
grace.
Project Description:             The project is designed to increase the domestic
supply of milk in Panama and is thus in line
with the Government's objective of reducing
Panama's dependence on imported milk. The
project will also support the Government's
rural development program by financing and
providing technical services for government-
sponsored settlements and for a government-
owned experimental farm. The project consists
of:
(a) long-term financing for on-farm investment
of small and medium-sized producers
primarily dedicated to milk production
(whether through specialized dairy or
beef/dairy herds), and to asentamientos,
cooperatives or other groups of farmers.
It is estimated that about 355 small and
medium-sized farms and 20 groups of
farmers would receive financing;

Procurement:                     Because of the number of beneficiaries likely
to be involved and the variety of items to be
procured, bulk purchases for farm loans would
not be feasible. Goods contained in farm
plans, therefore, would be procured by indivi-
dual beneficiaries who would purchase their
investment requirements through existing
commercial channels. In the case of procure-
ment of breeding cattle for PRODEIRHA, interna-
tional comparative shopping would be permitted.
This procedure is considered appropriate,
because the scope of bidding would be narrow
as the cattle involved would need to have
specific characteristics. Vehicles and equip-
ment for the use of project staff and consul-
tants would be procured through competitive

bidding advertised locally in accordance with
local procedures or through comparative
shopping, since the volume of purchases is
small and would be spread over the five years
of project execution.
Rate of Return:                  The overall rate of return of the project
is estimated at 20 percent.
