PANAMA
SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a livestock project for which a Bank loan of
US$8 million is proposed to help finance continuation of a program to foster
development o'f Panama's livestock subsector begun under the First Project
(Loan 901-PANI). The project would emphasize the extension of credit to small-
and medium-size farms primarily dedicated to milk production. Credit would
also be extended to agrarian reform settlements (asentamientos), cooperatives,
or other groups, whether private or public. The main objective would be to
increase milk production to help reduce a growing food import bill and thus
assist in improving the balance of payments.
ii.       The Bank has to date made four loans, totalling US$9.6 million, to
Panama for agricultural/fisheries development. Of these, two for agriculture,
totalling US$1.0 million, have been disbursed. The two ongoing projects are
a fisheries credit for which the Bank lent US$3.4 million in 1971 and a live-
stock credit project partially financed by a Bank loan of US$4.7 million in
1973. Project execution has been generally satisfactory.
iii.      The proposed project would support the development of about 376
cattle enterprises, involving three basic types of production units--dairy/
beef operations (dual purpose), which would improve on traditional systems;
specialized dairy farms, which would feature intensification of methods
for production of high quality milk; and a newly established and highly
specialized Government breeding and milk producing center, which would be
expanded for use as a supplier of acclimatized breeding cows and bulls and as
a Grade A milk unit, partially for production but mainly as a model for teach-
ing purposes. The provision of technical services, supervised long-term
credit and short-term working capital would be an integral part of the project.
Appropriate specialist and consultant services would also be provided. Total
project cost is estimated to be US$20 million and the proposed loan of US$8
million, equivalent to 40%, would finance the foreign exchange component. The
balance of project costs would be financed by the borrower, Banco Nacional de
Panama (BNP), the Government of Panama, and sub-borrowers.
iv.       As under the First Livestock Loan, the project would be administered
by the BNP through a Technical Unit (TU), which would be directly responsible
to the General Manager of BNP. It is expected that BNP would be the major
participant in making subloans to beneficiaries, but the participation of the
Banco de Desarrollo Agropecuario and other banks is not excluded.
v.        Interest rates to sub-borrowers would be no less than 11% per annum
plus a service fee of 0.5% on subloans below US$150,000 and 0.25% on subloans
above that figure. With an estimated cost of money to BNP of about 8.24%, the



margin of about 3% would be sufficient to cover costs of administration and
technical services. Lending terms to sub-borrowers would be for a maximum of
12 years, including a maximum grace period of five years. Procurement would be
according to Bank procedures; however, International Competitive Bidding (ICB)
would not be feasible for the small amounts and variety of items required
for individual farm development spread over the life of the project.
vi.       Estimated internal financial returns range from 13.5% to 18.5%.
The overall economic return is estimated to be about 20%. The project is
virtually free of risk provided the Government maintains its stxict policy
on preventing the entry of foot and mouth disease. /
vii.      The proposed project, which would be carried out through disburse-
ments over a period of five years, would make a significant improvement to
small farmer incomes and, to a slight degree, rural employment, both in the
development and developed stages. At full development, about 10 years after
effectiveness, net farm incomes would have increased from four to seven times
pre-development levels, representing incremental per capita incomes of about
US$1,000 to US$2,000 per year. Direct beneficiaries would be about 1,500
heads of families. There would be additional training benefits to 30 land
reform settlements (asentamientos) and to leaders of communal groups and small
farmers through courses set up by the TU and Government extension staff.
There would be tangible benefits in strengthening the technical capacity of
BNP. The results of the provision of consultant services to assist in the
expansion and diversification of meat processing industries could also help
Panama to reduce its reliance on processed meat imports. The beneficial
results which might be obtained from a modification of milk production stan-
dards and pricing would improve incentives to producers and increase the flow
of milk to consumers. At full development, there would be an annual incre-
mental production of 28,800 m tons of milk, 900 m tons of beef for domestic
consumption, and 6,500 head of improved dairy breeding stock. This production,
valued at 1976 prices, would be about US$9.5 million, representing net foreign
exchange savings of about US$6.2 million per year.
viii.     During negotiations, appropriate assurances were obtained that pro-
vide a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$8 million for 14 years, including
five years of grace, at an interest rate to the borrower of 8.5% per annum on
amounts withdrawn and outstanding. The Republic of Panama would guarantee the
loan and BNP would be the borrower. The Government would bear the exchange
risk involved.



PANAMA
SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Panama has requested a Bank loan of US$8 million
to help finance a continuation of its livestock development program, which was
initiated under the First Livestock Development Project, 901-PAN. The project
would emphasize the extension of credit to small- and medium-size farms pri-
marily dedicated to milk production, either from specialized or dual-purpose
herds. Credit would also be extended to settlements, cooperatives or other
groups for livestock production, whether private or public. Technical
assistance would form an integral part of financing and would include the
provision of experts in tropical pastures, animal fertility, and soil conser-
vation and consultant services to assist in the expansion and diversification
of the meat processing industries.
1.02      Bank Group lending to the agricultural sector of Panama has been
limited to four loans, spread over about 20 years and comprising Loan 86-PAN
for US$1.2 million for farm machinery (of which US$0.5 million was cancelled),
Loan 87-PAN of US$0.3 million for grain silos, Loan 784-PAN for US$3.4 million
for fisheries development, and Loan 901-PAN for US$4.7 million for livestock
development. The first two loans were approved in 1953 and have been dis-
bursed, while the fisheries and livestock loans were approved in 1971 and
1973, respectively. As of December 31, 1976, about 93% and 95% of the funds
of Loans 901-PAN and 784-PAN, respectively, had been committed and performance
can be regarded as satisfactory. Apart from Bank lending to the sector, the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development (USAID) have given considerable assistance in the form of
lines of credit extended through the Agricultural Development Bank (BDA) and
the National Bank of Panama (BNP) for agricultural development, fishing
cooperatives, nutrition and rural development. This assistance is complemen-
tary in nature to Bank-financed projects.
1.03      The proposed project was prepared by the Technical Unit (TU) of BNP,
in coordination with technicians of the Ministry of Agriculture (MIDA) and
the Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Panama, with an area of about 75,700 km  (see map, IBRD 10159R),
occupies the southern and narrowest portion of the isthmus joining North and
South America. Its population, currently estimated to be about 1.7 million,
is growing at a current rate of 3.1% annually. Adult literacy is about 80%,
one of the highest in Latin America. Although there is an overall population-
to-land ratio of only 22 persons per sq km, there is even less pressure on



- 2 -
land than this figure implies because only 50% of the population is classed as
rural. Available land area itself is not a constraint, but the resource base
is relatively narrow, due mainly to poor soils, variable rainfall and lack of
road communications and other infrastructure, especially in the Atlantic and
Darien zones.
2.02      Agriculture is less important in the economy of Panama than in most
other Latin American countries. Agriculture's share in GDP was only 15.9% in
1975 (1960 prices). The average annual rate of growth of the sector's future
contribution to GDP is estimated to be between 5.3% and 5.6%. Out of the
US$186 million it accounted for in 1975, about US$150 million was derived from
plantation and other crops, US$29 million from livestock products and the
balance from forestry and fisheries. In 1975, of a total agricultural export
value of about US$140 million, bananas, sugar and coffee accounted for about
82% of trade, fisheries products for about 16% and livestock products for only
2%. Overall in 1975, agricultural exports represented 50% of total merchandise
trade and about 13.5% of total trade.
2.03      Further expansion of agriculture requires more capital, specialized
manpower and a better trained labor force to improve yields, change cropping
patterns and extend the frontiers into new areas where this can be achieved
economically. In order to intensify production, greater emphasis should be
placed on research and extension.
B. The Agricultural Sector
Performance
2.04      While GDP increased at an annual rate of 6.8% in the period 1950-
54 to 1970-74, the growth of agriculture for the same period was only 4.2%
(Annex 1, Table 1). Import values of agricultural products in 1975 amounted
to about US$73 million, or 8.3% of total imports. The agricultural sector is
the source of the bulk of total merchandise export earnings. Government is
attempting through its agricultural policy to stimulate exports and to encour-
age the production of products leading to import substitution.
2.05      In 1975, bananas and livestock represented about 36% of the total
value of agricultural production. In response to a steep rise in prices due
to foreign and domestic demand, sugarcane production grew from an average of
0.9 million m tons per year (1965-69) to over 1.5 million m tons per year
between 1973 and 1975. During the past five years, cane output expanded at
an annual rate of over 14%, with yields of about 60 m tons per ha in 1975.
2.06      Performance of the agricultural and livestock sector between 1970
and 1975 was modest. The rate of growth in 1973 to about 2.9% was followed by
a decline of 0.7% in 1974 and a rise by 5.4% in 1975 when the value of crop
production in agricultural GDP rose 7.6% in real terms. The rate of growth



- 3 -
of the agricultural sector output between 1970 and 1975 was only 3.2% per
annum, not enough to satisfy the growth of 5.2% in aggregate demand. Bananas
and traditional corn and bean crops have declined in importance while rice and
sugar have made dramatic advances. Livestock contributes about 18% of value
added in the sector. Beef and milk production account for about 63% of total
livestock production, with the balance being derived from eggs, poultry and
pigs. The rate of growth of the livestock sector, which peaked to about 5%
per annum in 1970, has levelled off during the past five years due to tech-
nical and cost/price constraints. Bank lending for livestock development
since 1973 has been aimed at improving productivity to combat financial
constraints. Given the small size of the First Project, the impact on the
sector as a whole is not very marked.
2.07      In 1975, of a total export trade of about US$98 million, bananas,
sugar and coffee accounted for about 81%, fisheries products for about 17% and
livestock products for about 1.8%. Historically, bananas have dominated the
export trade in agricultural commodities, peaking in 1970-72 to about US$63
million a year but declining since then. Sugar exports, on the other hand,
rose to about 58,000 m tons in 1975, 80% above 1970 levels. Beef exports
began in 1966 and remained at less than 2,000 tons per annum through 1969,
reaching only 2,400 tons in 1972 when world market demand retreated and prices
fell. In 1974, only 1,200 tons of beef and about 1,000 head of live cattle
were exported. Total export value for beef and cattle in 1974 was US$2.4
million.
Government's Strategy in Agriculture
2.08      Since 1968, the Government's agricultural policies have sought to
improve the productivity and living standards of the rural population by
organizing small farmers into collective settlements (asentamientos) or coop-
eratives; by providing them with land, credit and technical assistance;
and by facilitating marketing of their output (Annex 1). In support of this
policy, public sector outlays for agriculture rose from 1.1% of GDP in
1969 to 4.1% in 1974, an annual increase of 26% in real terms. Initially,
these efforts were oriented towards land acquisition and settlement, peasant
organization and provision of social and economic services such as education,
health and feeder roads. Between 1969 and 1972, the Government acquired
330,000 ha--one-sixth of the total land in farms in 1970. The emphasis on
land redistribution created uncertainty among medium- and the large-scale
farmers regarding their own tenure stability. Reinforcing private sector
uncertainties, the authorities also maintained price ceilings on food staples
which discouraged private investment in basic crops (rice, corn and beans).
Thus, production of these crops fell sharply in 1969-72 (the drought of 1972
intensified the decline). Since 1973, the emphasis shifted towards the con-
solidation of settlement efforts in lands already acquired and the expansion
of production. In mid-1975 over 8,000 families remained established in 200
collective farms and 300 other cooperative units. Many collective farms have
been successfully growing rice in newly cleared low land, using capital-
intensive methods with subsidized Government credit. In 1974/75 organized
farm groups produced nearly 25,000 tons of rice at an average yield of 2.2 m



- 4 -
tons/ha, 20% higher than the nationwide average yield. As part of the efforts
to increase production, the authorities have substantially increased support
prices and expanded their marketing activities. These measures brought about
increases in the production of perishable vegetables, a reversal in the
declining trend of basic grains and a return to self-sufficiency in rice. In
the livestock sector, milk output has not been able to keep up with the growth
in domestic demand, and Panama has had to depend increasingly on imports of
milk products to supply the local market. The share of imported milk in total
domestic supply more than doubled in the period 1960-74, increasing from 32 to
77.5 million liters. Milk imports in 1974 represented 54% of total domestic
milk supply. This is reflected in an import bill for milk and milk products
of US$10.6 million in 1974 (1.4% of merchandise imports). Because milk can be
competitively produced in Panama, the Government attributes the highest prior-
ity to increasing output to attain self sufficiency by 1980. The proposed
project would assist the Government to meet this objectTve.
Employment, Wages and Poverty
2.09      Panama's rural population in 1974 was 50% of the total population as
compared with about 60% in 1960. Of the work force in Panama in 1974, only
about one-third (175,000) were engaged in agriculture. 1/ Absolute rural
unemployment is very low, at only just over 1%, but, due to the seasonal
nature of some products, notably sugar, there is considerable underemployment
during the year. On the other hand, at peak periods there is an absolute
shortage of labor (Annex 1).
2.10      Average per capita rural income is estimated at about US$285 per
year as compared with US$1,063 for the overall country average. Within the
rural category, there is an estimated annual per capita range of from US$53 to
about US$1,750. It is also estimated that about 40% of the rural population
(300,000 persons) lives in extreme poverty, which is defined by the Government
as a total family income of less than US$200 per person. Although the minimum
wage in 1976 for unskilled agricultural labor was US$3.00 per day, the highest
in Central America, given the state of underemployment in the sector, the paid
labor group would nevertheless still fall generally into the Government cate-
gory of the rural poor.
Land Tenure and Distribution
2.11      Almost all rural families in Panama own or occupy a parcel of land.
There is little land rental. In the absence of a clear land policy for per-
manent settlement (excluding the program of agrarian reform) and land taxation
and the prevalence of shifting cultivation, nearly 75% of the farms were un-
titled in 1970. This is mainly true of the small subsistence farms under 10
1/   Since rural families have more children than urban families, the share
of agriculture in the labor force (which includes only workers over 15
years of age) is considerably lower than the share of rural population
in total population.



ha. Of the larger, well established farms of over 200 ha, only 25% lacked
titles. Whereas in the past, tenure insecurity did not present a problem,
formal titling is now much more important since future increases in agricul-
tural output must come from improved productivity of the land now in use,
which is especially true if long-term credit is required for fixed investment
in land improvement.
2.12      Land distribution is skewed.  Farms of 200 ha or more represent 1.3%
of all farms and have 35% of farm land (Annex 1, Table 5). Farms from 20 to
200 ha, about 25% of land holdings, occupy about 50% of farm land area. There
are some 41,000 holdings between 0.5 and 5 ha representing about 45% of farms
and less than 4% of farm land area. There are also 14,000 plots of less than
0.5 ha which are occupied by squatters. These are mainly subsistence in
nature. In 1970, of a total of 83,000 farms of more than 1 ha, 30,000 had no
sales. Of the remaining 53,000, 20,000 had sales of less than US$100 per
year, indicating the extent of rural poverty. Although land itself is no
constraint in Panama, most of the easily cultivable land is already occupied
and cannot be distributed without reducing even further the area available per
farm or family. Expansion of areas in farm use will require very large public
financing of roads and social facilities before either spontaneous or con-
trolled colonization can take place. The Government is fully aware of the
problems of land and income distribution and has made substantial efforts to
solve them (para 2.08). Public policy for the moment is aimed at intensifying
productive land use rather than extending the area of land to be brought under
production.
The Livestock Sub-sector
2.13      Since 1970 the gross value of livestock production in constant (1960)
terms has risen only from US$45.2 million to US$47.9 million in 1974. Of these
values, cattle production represented 40% in 1970 and dropped to 35% in 1974,
due mainly to increased production of pigs and poultry. As well as declin-
ing relatively, the value of cattle production dropped absolutely in value
from US$18.2 million in 1970 to US$16.9 million in 1974, mainly because of
prolonged drought conditions and depressed export prices.
2.14      In 1975, Panama had about 1.35 million head of cattle (Annex 1) as
compared with about 1.20 million in 1970. In the 10 years to 1971, the na-
tional herd grew at a compound annual rate of about 4.9%, but dropped in the
period 1971-75 to less than 2%. From 1970 to 1975, beef production rose from
34,400 m tons to an estimated 44,300 m tons, but milk production declined
from a record 74.0 million liters in 1971 to a low of 62.0 million liters in
1974, rising, however, to 70.0 million liters in 1975. The drops in production
in 1973 and 1974 were due to bad seasonal conditions.
2.15      About 31% of all cattle and 44% of milking cattle are kept on
holdings of less than 50 ha, mainly in dual-purpose (beef/dairy) operations.
Specialized dairying is conducted on farms ranging from 50 to 100 ha, with
beef breeding on the larger holdings. There is, however, a tendency away
from beef production towards dual-purpose operations and specialized dairying.

Future trends overall will be influenced largely by market demand and pricing
policies.
Animal Health
2.16      While diseases constitute a serious constraint, poor husbandry, as
reflected in low nutritional standards, lack of parasite control and faulty
herd selection, is more responsible for the poor general condition of the
herds than disease. Major production losses are from brucellosis and tick-
borne organisms, but direct infestation of ticks, "torsalo" and intestinal and
other parasites in young animals is possibly more of a problem. There are few
killing diseases except for occasional sporadic losses from anthrax. The
country is free of foot and mouth disease (FMD) and its entry -s currently
blocked by the undeveloped Darien area, a buffer zone with Colombia. Both
countries have taken steps to prevent FMD through (in Colombia) vaccination
control measures, the policing of cattle movement and the establishment of
unstocked reserves. With the assistance of the Inter-American Development
Bank and the Pan-American Health Organization, the Government is developing a
broad program to prevent the entry of FMD once the Inter-American highway
connecting Panama with Colombia is completed. General veterinary services and
supply of drugs are adequate.
C. Banking and Agricultural Credit
General
2.17      Panama has a well developed banking system (Annex 2), which is
dissimilar from that of other Latin American countries--there is no central
bank and foreign banks dominate the private sector. In 1976 a total of 46
banks operated in 184 offices throughout the country, with head offices in
Panama City. There are five public banks--BNP, the Caja de Ahorros (savings
bank), the Agricultural Development Bank (BDA), the National Finance Corpora-
tion which is dedicated to industrial lending, and the Banco Hipotecario. The
national currency is the balboa, which is equivalent to one US dollar. The
banking system is supervised by the National Banking Commission (NBC), which
is administratively under the Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy. Total
bank lending operations (domestic and foreign) went from US$2.2 billion in
1972 to US$8.8 billion in 1975. Domestic lending increased from US$1.0 billion
to US$1.9 billion in the same period. Lending by the official banks in 1974
accounted for 11% of total domestic lending and they themselves carried only
a small agricultural portfolio (Annex 2, Table 3).
2.18      Funds for lending come from three sources:  (a) paid-in capital and
accumulated profits, (b) deposits and inter-bank borrowings, and (c) other
borrowings. In 1975, 86% of all funds came from foreign sources and the share
of local deposits had sunk to only 10% as against 36% in 1971. Banks pay no
interest on demand deposits. For time deposits, interest paid varies from



4.5% per annum to 7.75%, depending on the term, with mortgage brokers paying
at least 1% more than commercial banks. Private banks pay rates which are
from 0.25% to 1% higher than those paid by BNP (Annex 2).
Agricultural Lending
2.19      In the 1972-75 period, total domestic institutional lending increased
by 70% while agricultural lending during the same period increased by 95%.
Thus the proportion of agricultural to total domestic lending (excluding loans
made to the public sector) increased from 8% to 9%. Total agriculture credit
rose from US$76.4 million in 1972 to US$149.4 million in 1975. This was due
to the increased lending by private banks for short-term financing of cattle
purchases and for production and marketing of agricultural products. Credit
for agriculture came mainly from a few private banks, with the official banks,
BNP and BDA, supplying only about 17% of total credit to the sector. In 1974,
out of a total lending for livestock of US$70.3 million, only US$17.2 was lent
by the official banks, including in this amount the only long-term funds for
cattle development in Panama. The overall trend indicates a relative increase
in lending for crops, poultry and fisheries and a small decline in livestock
lending in 1974.
2.20      The NBC has the power to fix maximum rates of interest charged
on loans but it has chosen to let market forces determine lending rates. An
exception has been the loans granted under Decree Law 95 of 1974, which
temporarily set a ceiling on interest rates of 8% and 9%, respectively,
for special loans for agriculture and industry. BNP currently (May 1976)
charges about 11% for agricultural loans, plus a service fee. This rate is
reportedly from 1% to 3% below other bank rates. In the case of loans under
901-PAN, the interest rate was a flat 10%. Under Decree Law 54 of September
7, 1976, the ceilings established under Decree Law 95 were discontinued from
September 30, 1976.
2.21      Although the general banking law does not specify the kind of col-
lateral required for loans, long-term development loans are generally against
first mortgages, with additional chattel mortgages if these are required.
To qualify for long-term loans, it is important for borrowers to have clear,
legal title to land, which is something of a drawback in Panama. The titling
situation is being tackled under the First Livestock Development Project by
including survey and legal fees leading to titling in the long-term financing
program (Annex 1). This assistance would be continued under the Second Project.
2.22      As in the past, long-term funds for livestock will probably continue
to be supported from international sources, namely, the Bank and IDB (para
1.02). While the IDB line of credit for agriculture through the BDA can be
used to finance long-term investments in livestock, in practice it has been
largely used to finance crops and for the purchase of cattle for very small
farmers, so that virtually the only funds for supervised long-term livestock
development are those of 901-PAN and this has motivated the request of Govern-
ment for continued Bank financial assistance under the proposed Second Live-
stock Development Project.



-8-
Banco Nacional de Panama (BNP)
2.23      BNP, the official state bank, is also the country's largest commer-
cial bank. It serves as fiscal and fiduciary agent for Government and performs
functions for the Treasury (Annex 2). While BNP assets have grown at a rate
of about 11% a year from 1971 to 1976, its paid-up capital and reserves have
advanced only modestly, from about US$14 million to about US$18 million for
the same period (about 3% per annum). Net annual profit, which in 1971 was
about US$950,000 on all operations, had fallen to about US$590,000 in 1976,
with substantial variations in between. BNP has taken steps to increase
income and reduce its operating costs. The BNP debt/equity ratio increased
from 3.93:1 in 1971 to 11.59:1 in 1975, particularly because of public sector
financing, however, at the end of 1976, this ratio had been reduced to about
10.4:1.
2.24      According to additional advice and data received from BNP since
appraisal, the following is a summary of the major past and proposed actions:
(a) to reduce the debt/equity ratio to 8:1 by the end of 1978 and
to 6:1 by 1980 by limiting the borrowing from commercial banks,
and by increasing capital and reserves;
(b) to identify and age arrears through computerization and speed up
the process of recoveries by tightening loan collection and
reorganizing and expanding a unit specialized in debt recovery;
(c) to reduce operation costs, through a process of austerity and
improved cost control;
(d) to adjust the portfolio to concentrate on its most profitable
banking activities; and
(e) to limit development banking activities only to those partially
financed by international organizations.
The positive effects of the actions already taken during 1976 are shown in
Annex 2, the most significant of which is that total arrears have been reduced
to 8.3% of the total portfolio at end of 1976 as compared with 11.6% at the
end of 1975 and 1974. Anomalies in the handling of pension funds have been
resolved in legislation retroactive to April 1975.
D. Performance Under the On-going Project
2.25      The First Livestock Development Project (Loan 901-PAN for US$4.7
million) initiated the long-term development of the livestock industry
(Annex 3).  It became effective in November 1973 and is about 40% behind



-9-
the estimated disbursement schedule, largely because of delays in establishing
the technical unit. The borrower is BNP, which also acts as a direct lender
to farmers. BDA is the only participating bank for lending to asentamientos.
Execution is in the hands of a Technical Unit (TU) of BNP, specifically
established for the purpose. Major objectives were to increase beef and milk
production through the financing of about 570 farms and the provision of
technical services. Incremental annual output at full development (10 years)
was estimated to be about 8,000 m tons of beef, 7,000 m tons of milk, and
about 9,000 breeding animals. After only three years, it is not possible to
measure the full impact of the project in objective terms; however, a limited
monitoring and data collection system has been initiated, which will yield
valuable data. This system would be improved and expanded under the Second
Project.
2.26      On December 31, 1976, 306 farm loans had been made and 90% of loan
funds for farm development had been committed. An additional 27 subloans were
under study and full commitment is expected by April 1977.
2.27      Emphasis in lending in 1974 and 1975 has shifted away from beef
towards dual-purpose and specialized milk production, due mainly to a decline
in the export beef market and Government pricing policies which have favored
milk. This trend was not foreseen at the time of appraisal. Current lending
is mainly for small dairy and dual-purpose farms, and the overall average loan
size per farm family is about US$15,000, compared with the appraisal estimate
of US$16,500. Investment patterns correspond closely with appraisal forecasts,
although building costs to meet public health standards for the production of
grade A milk are too high to be justified in the Panamanian environment (para
4.04).
2.28      The consultant firm of Administracion, Estudios y Asesoramientos,
SA (ADEASA), appointed under the project, is performing satisfactorily and
a preliminary study of the Atlantic Coast has been completed. A second-
phase detailed study approved by Government for a specific zone in Colon
Province has also been completed and will shortly be presented to the Bank.
2.29      With regard to the 1975 auditing of Loans 784-PAN and 901-PAN,
although the Comptroller General has commented satisfactorily on the financial
information provided, his report contained recommendations for improving
internal accounting controls. Evidence has been received that all of these
recommendations have been incorporated in the 1976 accounting year. BNP has
informed us that these recommendations have been incorporated in the 1976
project accounts.
2.30      In spite of initial administrative difficulties, the BNP has improved
its project performance except that there are still some delays in the legal
processing of loan applications, and disbursement at the field level is still
slow, causing delays in requests for disbursement from the Project Loan Account.
Details of BNP are given in Annex 2. No private banks have participated because
of their lack of interest in long-term lending activities for livestock devel-
opment. BDA lacked counterpart funds for lending to small farms and asenta-
mientos with the result that BNP has been dealing directly with these sub-
borrowers.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Brief Description
3.01      The project would aim primarily at increasing the local supply of
milk in Panama through improved grassland production, better husbandry, and
upgrading or replacement of poor quality cattle in areas which do not readily
lend themselves to more intensive crop production than is currently being
practiced. In addition, the project would help reduce the high annual cost of
importing milk products, thus reducing Panama's balance of payments problems.
3.02      The project's main elements would be:
(a) long-term financing of on-farm investments by small- and medium-
sized producers primarily dedicated to milk production (whether
through specialized dairy or beef/dairy herds) and by agrarian
reform settlements or other collective groups. It is estimated
that about 355 small- and medium-sized farms and 20 settlements
would receive financing;
(b) long-term financing of on-farm investments in the livestock
operations of the Integrated Development Program of Rio Hato
(PRODEIRHA), a newly established state farm which serves as a
production center and as a training center for farmers. PRODEIRHA
is run as an independent organization. The farm is under the
technical responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture (MIDA) and
is located on land which is part of the military base of Rio Hato;
and
(c) provision of technical services, including (i) five man-years of
specialist services, principally in animal fertility, soil con-
servation and tropical pastures, to assist the participating
farmers and the technical staff of the BNP; (ii) support of the
TU of BNP; and (iii) the provision of consultant services for the
expansion and diversification of the meat processing industries in
Panama.
3.03      As under 901-PAN, the BNP would administer the project and channel
funds to sub-borrowers.   Commitment of project funds would be over three
years, with a disbursement period of five years. Direct beneficiaries would
be about 355 small farmers, about 20 settlements or cooperatives, and a large
Government-owned dairy/breeding farm. Subloans would be made on the basis of
farm plans appraised by technicians working under the supervision of the
Director of the TU established within BNP.

B. Detailed Features
3.05      The project area would be country-wide (map, IBRD 10159R), but
operations would tend to be concentrated in those areas with an already
developed infrastructure for the marketing of milk. Land reform settlements
or similarly constituted groupings 1/ of producers could be financed to attain
auto-sufficiency in milk production for internal consumption even if no
marketing infrastructure exists. The financing of PRODEIRHA would be on the
established Government farm at Rio Hato in the Province of Cocle. The farm
models used in this report (Annex 4, Tables 1 to 16) represent illustrative
average enterprises based on experience under Loan 901-PAN, while that for
PRODEIRHA is specific.
On-farm Investments
3.06      Dual-purpose Farms (Annex 4, Tables 4 to 7).  Subloans would finance
about 240 farm units including asentamientos on areas averaging about 50 ha
each on which beef and milk production would be combined, with emphasis on the
latter. Farm plans would concentrate on land clearing of lower slopes to
establish improved pasture species and small areas of fodder grasses for
direct feeding or conservation. Structural improvements would include fencing,
simple but hygienically adequate milking sheds, piped water supply to sheds,
farm pond development, and improved milking strain cattle. Funds would also
be available for improvements to substandard housing, limited essential
machinery, storage facilities and adequate protection of the farms' land
resources such as contouring and tree planting. Average on-farm investments,
including the purchase of cattle, would be about US$26,200. The program for
this development activity would require the purchase of about 8,000 breeding
females and 540 dairy-type bulls, spread over the five years of project
disbursement. These should be readily available from commercial breeders or
through Government breeding centers, including PRODEIRHA. About 400 families,
representing about 2,100 persons, would be involved.
3.07      Specialized Dairy Farms (Annex 4, Tables 8 to 11).  About 135 small,
specialized dairying operations of about 50 ha each would receive subloans
under the project. Such operations would also be financed on selected
asentamientos. As in the dual-purpose farms, milk production would be based
principally on improved pastures and herd improvement, with supplementary
feeding as justified by individual milk yields. Productivity would also
be improved through breeding and yield recording and rigorous culling of
poor producers. All bull calves would be sold within a week of birth.
Only those selected heifers required for replacement would be reared and the
balance would be sold. The activity as represented by this model would be a
transition by above-average producers to Grade A milk production.  To meet the
1/   These could include "asentamientos" or group settlements established
under the Agrarian Reform Law, "Juntas Agrarias de Produccion," which
are formed by the pooling of land resources legally owned by campesinos,
or cooperatives.



- 13 -
current stringent hygiene standards, a high capital investment in dairy
buildings would be required as well as a high investment in dairy strain
milking cows. A shortage of suitably adapted cows would initially restrict
the rapid expansion of these units. The cost of on-farm investments, in-
cluding cattle purchase, would be about US$46,300, which would be reduced when
Government public health policies on building standards for Grade A milk
production are relaxed (para 4.04). The program for this activity would
require the purchase of about 3,750 specialized dairy cows and about 300
pure-bred dairy bulls over five years. Some of these would come from local
breeders but the bulk would be purchased from breeding centers that are being
established to import, adapt, and sell such animals (para 3.08). About 200
families, representing about 1,050 persons, would be involved.
3.08      PRODEIRHA (Annex 4, Tables 12 to 16).  The yroject would finance
the development of 1,000 ha of improved pastures and infrastructure for
specialized milk production as well as the importation, adaptation and
subsequent multiplication of improved milking strain cows for sale to small
farmers, principally project beneficiariesO This center, managed under the
responsibility of MIDA, would form part of a Governmnent network to produce
adapted milking cows and thus help achieve national self-sufficiency in milk
production. The farm is centrally situated to serve a large representative
area of small- and medium-size farms and land reform settlemenc-s. Investments
would be made in pastures for intensive, rotational grazing; forages for
conservation; fencing for adequate control of pastures; water supplies for
cattle and dairy sheds; contouring and tree planting for conservation; essen-
tial buildings for milking, calf rearing, management and labor; corrals;
tanks and troughs; transport; mechanization; feed mills; milking machinery;
storage; and the importation of young heifers and bulls. The capital cost of
development of the PRODEIRHA farm, including the initial purchase of breeding
cattle, is expected to be about US$1.7 million over a period of three years.
The center now employs about 450 local people on a seasonal basis in its
cropping activities, and, at full development of its livestock component, it
would provide employment for 33 additional adults. In addition, through its
school, PRODEIRHA would have a direct beneficial training and technical ser-
vices influence on 10 local asentamientos.  About 2,000 young animals, mainly
young females for breeding, would be imported over three years.  The supply of
these imported animals is not considered to be a constraint. Details of the
organization and management of PRODEIRHA are shown in Annex 4.  During nego-
tiations it was agreed that it would be a condition of disbursement of Bank
funds for the PRODEIRHA sub-project that the final detailed form of the
livestock development plan had been approved by the Bank, including approval
by the Bank of the legal constitution and capitalization of PRODEIRHA, and
that US$500,000 had been deposited in an account with BNP to provide comple-
mentary financing of the livestock sub-project of PRODEIRHA. The preliminary
feasibility study in Annex 4 indicates a Government contribution of about
US$1.0 million) which would be in the format of equity funds. During negotia-
tions, assurances were obtained that the subloan agreement (escritura) be-
tween BNP and PRODEIRHA would include the assumption of risk and a subloan
guarantee by Government; that PRODEIRHA would maintain senarato livestock



- 14 -
budgets, accounts, and balance sheets, auditing and management; that the
technical manager for livestock operations of PRODEIRHA would be appointed
in consultation with the Bank; and that veterinary and other services were
adequate to ensure the success of the sub-project. Additionally, it would
be a condition of disbursement of Bank funds for the acquisition and impor-
tation of cattle under the PRODEIRHA sub-project that the Bank shall have
reviewed the plan for the import operation, including the arrangements for
purchase, assembly and shipment, and that the Bank shall have received
evidence from PRODEIRHA that the necessary technical and physical infrastruc-
ture would be adequate and available to receive the cattle prior to arrival
of cattle.
Technical Services
3.09      Technical Unit (TU).  Total project costs for the operation of an
expanded TU of BNP during the five-year period of investment and disbursement
phases amount to about US$2 million (Annex 5, Table 1), of which about 73%
would be for salaries and wages, 7% for vehicles and project equipment and the
balance for the oveiseas training and travel of staff and technicians of
the TU (a total of about 10 man-months of overseas training per year). As
under Loan 901-PAN, the proposed loan would continue to partially finance the
TU to the extent of about US$350,000 to cover foreign exchange (FE) costs.
These FE costs would primarily include about US$125,000 for gasoline and
vehicle spare parts for project execution and about US$200,000 for the pur-
chase of project vehicles, equipment and overseas training of technical staff.
All local currency costs would be borne by BNP and paid for out of its oper-
ating spread of about 3% per annum. Total project costs for the TU would
also cover the salaries of the Director, specialists, administrative and
service staff and the costs of office accommodation and operation.
3.10      Consultants.  The proposed loan would provide about US$320,000 to
finance about five man-years of consultant services, principally in animal
fertility, soil conservation and tropical pastures. Such services could be
performed under short- or medium-term contracts, depending on project needs as
determined by the Project Director and as approved by the Bank (para 3.21).
Under this category, funds would also be made available for the provision of
consultant services to assist in the expansion and diversification of the meat
processing industries in Panama.
C. Cost Estimates
3.11      Total project cost is estimated at US$20 million, of which about
US$8 million, or 40%, is the foreign exchange component. Estimates are sum-
marized as follows:

3.12      Cost estimates are in current 1976 terms and based on detailed farm
data analysis. Physical contingencies are included at about 5% of farm invest-
ment costs. Price contingencies were applied according to the most recent
Bank guidelines on world inflation--1977 to 1979--8%; in 1980 and thereafter,
7% per annum.

D. Financing
3.13      Financing of the project would be shared in the following amounts
and proportions:

/1   Figures are rounded.
3.14      Project costs would be financed as follows:  (a) the Bank loan of
US$8 million would cover the foreign exchange component, or 40% of total
costs; (b) BNP would finance US$8.0 million, or 40%; (c) Government would
provide US$1.0 million, or 5% of cost, as its contribution to the development
of the farm operated by PRODEIRHA; and (d) farm beneficiaries would contribute
US$3.0 million, or 15%. In addition to the above, assurances were obtained
during negotiations that BNP alone or in cooperation with other participating
banks would supply short-term working capital as might be required to comple-
ment the long-term development subloans granted under this project.
3.15      Subloans for farm development would finance no more than 80% of
approved farm investment plans. The balance of at least 20% would be provided
by sub-borrowers in the form of cash, contract labor or materials. In the
case of PRODEIRHA, the Government would be responsible for providing 50% of
total investment costs in lieu of the normal beneficiary contribution in the
form of equity. This would be in cash. Financing of technical services would
be jointly financed by the Bank loan and BNP on a 20%:80% basis. During
negotiations, assurances on the above described financing terms were obtained.
The Republic of Panama would guarantee the loan and BNP would be the borrower.
The Government would bear the foreign exchange risk. The loan of US$8 million
would be for 14 years, including a grace period of five years.



- 17 -
E. Procurement
3.16      Goods for investments contained in farm plans approved by the
Project Director would be procured according to normal Bank procedures,
whereby individual beneficiaries would purchase their requirements through
existing commercial channels. This system is being used under Loan 901-PAN.
Panama has a good network of suppliers of agricultural inputs, competition is
keen, and facilities for maintenance of machinery and equipment are adequate.
In the case of the subloans to PRODEIRHA involving the importation of breeding
cattle, procurement might involve the use of a variety of methods. Interna-
tional comparative shopping would be permitted subject to Bank approval and
the supervision of the Project Director. As the cattle involved would need to
be specific milking strains, adapted or adaptable to tropical and semi-tropical
conditions from countries free of foot and mouth and other specified diseases
and preferably with prior exposure to a tick challenge, the scope for bidding
would be narrow. Vehicles and equipment for the use of project staff and
consultants would be procured through competitive bidding advertised locally
in accordance with local procedures or through comparative shopping, since
the volume of purchases is small and would be spread over the five years of
project execution. Foreign firms are adequately represented in Panama and
there are no significant import restrictions which might affect procurement
through local channels. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that
the above described procurement procedures would be followed.
F. Disbursement
3.17      The Bank would disburse over a period of five years:
(a) 46% of amounts previously advanced for farm development subloans
for a value of about US$4.9 million;
(b) 100% of amounts previously advanced for the PRODEIRHA subloan
for a total of about Us$0.9 million;
(c) 75% of the following TU costs:
(i) the purchase of vehicles, equipment and overseas
training, amounting to about US$195,000; and
(ii) gasoline and vehicle spare parts used in project
execution to the extent of about US$115,000;
(d) 100% of the costs of consultant specialists in animal fertility,
tropical pastures and soils and in meat processing for a total of
US$320,000.



- 18 -
The above figures do not include the Bank's share of the price contingencies,
which were calculated to be about US$1.2 million over the life of the project.
3.18      Disbursement for technical and consultant services, the study and
the purchase of other project-related equipment would be made against normal
documentation. Disbursement for farm subloans would be made against a certif-
icate of expenditure, the documentation for which would not be subject to
review, but would be retained by the borrower and available for inspection
by the Bank during the course of project supervision. Annual phasing of the
investment and estimated disbursement details are shown in Annexes 6 and 7.
Project cash flow is shown in Annex 8.
G. Organization and Management
3.19      BNP would be the borrower and would also execute the project
(para 3.23). Although BNP is competently managed,its financial position as of
December 31, 1975 revealed certain weaknesses specifically as reflected in its
arrears. However, corrective measures have been taken and more are planned to
improve BNP's situation. The Bank is satisfied that all reasonable remedies
have been, or are being, applied by BNP to improve its situation (para 2.24).
3.20      Day-to-day management of the project would be handled by the TU
within BNP. It would be composed of a Project Director, agricultural econ-
omist, dairy production specialist and an administrative assistant, all
acceptable to the Bank. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that
such specialists would be retained during the five years of project execution.
The Project Director would supervise the field activities of livestock techni-
cians and be directly concerned with their training to assist farmers in
preparing technically and financially viable farm plans. The number of
technicians would be increased from the current number of 14 to a minimum of
20, appropriately distributed in the Project Area. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that this increase would take place by February 28,
1978. Project headquarters would remain at Panama City but regional offices
would be opened at the recommendation of the Project Director and approval by
the General Manager of BNP. In addition to the technical staff described
above, the TU would be supported by administrative and service staff and
adequately provided with office space, field transportation and any equipment
and facilities necessary to achieve project objectives.
3.21      The Project Director, who would be answerable to the General Manager
of BNP or his designated representative, would be responsible for approving
all subloans for presentation to the Credit Committee of BNP. All subloans
would be based on farm plans demonstrating the financial and technical viabil-
ity of the proposal. No subloan would finance more than 55% for the purchase
of young (less than three years) breeding cattle. Subloans in excess of
US$100,000 and the PRODEIRHA subloan would be submitted to the Bank for prior
approval. Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations. The



- 19 -
Project Director would draw up the terms of reference and contracts, including
conditions for short- to medium-term consultant services in tropical pasture
development, soils and soil conservation and in animal fertility, for Bank
approval. He would, in consultation with officials of the Ministries of Plan-
ning and of Agriculture, also draw up terms of reference and other contract
details for consultant services for the expansion and diversification of the
meat processing industries for final Bank approval. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that the above consultants would be recruited by
February 28, 1978.
3.22      Apart from his direct function of assisting the Project Director in
assessing the financial viability of farm plans, the agricultural economist
would have prime responsibility for initiating and maintaining a monitoring
system of data collection and evaluation, acceptable to the Bank, to measure
the impact of the project. He would also advise on problems of prices and
marketing of project products which could detract from the achievement of
project objectives.  Assurances were obtained during negotiations that a
permanent monitoring system would be established by February 28, 1978 to
embrace Loan 901-PAN as well as the proposed project. Data collected would
form part of project completion reports for both projects.
H. Lending Operations
3.23      As the borrower, under the terms of the Loan Agreemeat, BNP would
have the dual role of being the channel for Bank funds to participating banks
and also lending directly to project beneficiaries. Participating banks would
be required to sign subsidiary loan agreements, acceptable to the Bank, with
BNP, such agreements to include provisions for counterpart financing, comple-
mentary short-term credits and technical expertise. Assurances on this were
obtained at negotiations.
3.24      The proposed lending rate to sub-borrowers would be no less than 11%
per annum, plus a service fee of 0.5% on subloans below US$150,000 and 0.25%
on subloans above that figure. This proposal corresponds to the norms of BNP
and takes into account the overall blended cost to BNP of 8.37% per annum,
given an average current cost of funds to BNP of 8.24% per annum and a Bank
loan at 8.5% per annum on outstanding balances. This should give a gross
margin to BNP of 3% per annum, which should be sufficient to cover the cost of
technical assistance, general overheads and lending risk. The proposed
lending rate would be positive, given current estimates of internal inflation
for 1976 of about 9.5%, and thereafter an average of 7.6% per annum. Subloans
made through any participating bank (PB) would be at the same rate, to whom
BNP would on-lend at 9%. This would give PBs a slightly higher margin than
the 2% now earned under the First Livestock Development Project, but it is
unlikely that these terms would be attractive enough to encourage their
participation.



- 20 -
3.25      Proposed maximum sublending terms to beneficiaries are:
(a)  Beef/dairy - 12 years, including a grace period of five years.
(b)  Dairy - 10 years, including a grace period of four years.
(c)  PRODEIRHA - 12 years, including a grace period of five years.
Incremental working capital for annual recurring costs would be provided
by BNP or other PBs. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
the interest rates, margins and the terms specified above would be applied
and that short-term subloans would be made available at current commercial
terms (para 3.14).
I. Accounts and Auditing
3.26      As required under the First Livestock Development Project, BNP
would establish and maintain separate project accounts, which would enable
the auditors and Bank staff to readily identify the uses of the proceeds of
project funds and permit balance sheets and income statements to be properly
submitted. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that these accounts
would be established and made available to the Bank during supervision.
In general, account details would be such that individual subloan investment
items, advances, payments to suppliers, short-term loans and repayment sched-
ules and actual repayments made would also be available. Such details would
be useful to BNP staff independent of the TU and the external auditors or Bank
staff in carrying out field verification as required. In addition, copies of
annual budgets for the TU and actual operating expenses would be maintained.
3.27      Assurances were obtained at negotiations that BNP accounts including
project accounts, as under the First Livestock Project, would continue to be
audited annually by independent auditors, acceptable to the Bank, and that the
audited statements would be sent to the Bank not later than four months after
the close of each fiscal year.
IV.  PRODUCTION, MARKETS AND MARKETING, PRICES AND PRODUCER BENEFITS
Production
4.01      Incremental annual production by farmers benefitting from the
project would be significant, as shown below. The figures are derived
from the models only and are limited, as there is no attempt to illustrate
any type of spin-off.

Breeding Animals      n.a.           6,500                    n.a.
4.02      Incremental production data are based on a thorough study and
the reasonable application of well-known production and management tech-
niques, improved pasture for better nutrition, parasite control and increased
fertility of breeding animals through rigid selection and culling. Production
parameters used in model building are realistic and reflect what is already
being done and what could be achieved by project beneficiaries with technical
assistance by the TU of BNP and of the extension technicians of MIDA.
Markets and Marketing
4.03      The incremental production of milk from the project would be an
import substitute and thus would not face demand or marketing constraints,
provided that Government's policies of milk imports and domestic pricing are
consistent with its objectives of becoming self-sufficient in domestic milk
production. Similarly, there is a strong demand and an adequate marketing
system for the sale of improved milking strain, in-calf breeding heifers and
purebred young bulls that would be produced on the farms of project benefi-
ciaries. Adequate lines of credit, both to project and other borrowers, exist
for their purchase. The amount of beef produced under the project would be
small, relative to total production, and, as it is virtually a by-product of
the dairy industry, it would be of a quality more suited to cheaper cuts for
domestic consumption or manufacturing than export. There is a need and an
adequate demand for this cheaper type beef. Marketing systems for beef
production under the project are satisfactory.
Milk Prices
4.04      Producers' price levels for beef and milk are adequate to guarantee
project financial success and provide incentives to producers. In view of the
current gap in the production of milk and a prolonged and severe drought in
1975/76, the Government, in September 1976, increased the price of milk to
producers by an average of two cents per liter. This increase was also passed
on to the consumers. Prices at farm-gate are now 23 cents per liter for Grade
A milk in Chiriqui Province and 25 cents per liter in the central provinces.
Prices to producers of industrial milk vary from 16.5 cents and 17.5 cents per
liter, respectively, for the two areas. The project is designed to improve
production standards so that project beneficiaries would qualify for Grade A



- 22 -
licensing. A USAID study of public health, farm production, farm inspection
and quality control standards and pricing for milk was completed in September
1976 and the recommendations of this study to modify farm building codes for
Grade A licenses, have been reviewed by Government. If adopted, there would
be a significant reduction in investment costs and a beneficial effect on
farmers' incomes without necessarily increasing the cost of milk to the
public. It would be a condition of loan effectiveness that Government had
presented for Bank approval and subsequently enacted its revised public health
laws and associated regulations relating to milk quality levels, on-farm
building standards, production requirements, milk testing and farm inspection
programs and had established a uniform pricing policy for all milk that would
recognize quality, such as fat content, solids not fat, and low bacterial
count, for grade and price fixing rather than the current basis of licensing
based on building standard requirements.
Producer Benefits
4.05      A summary of producer benefits, as derived from the illustrative
models (Annex 4, Tables 4 to 16), is as follows:

- 23 -
V.   BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
5.01      The project has one of the highest priorities in the development
program for Panama's agricultural sector. It would help to reduce the con-
straints imposed on the sector by the shortage of foreign exchange by provid-
ing long-term resources for investment purposes. Since Panama is a net
importer of milk, the additional domestic production would lead to savings of
foreign exchange by cutting down on the quantities required to be imported to
meet current demand and projected nutritional needs. At full development, the
estimated value of the incremental output of milk, beef and breeding stock, at
1976 prices, would be about US$9.5 million per year. The net foreign exchange
savings of the project at full development would be about US$6.2 million per
year.
5.02      Direct beneficiaries of the project would be 355 small- to medium-
size farms, 20 asentamientos, and a Government-operated dairy/breeding farm,
involving in total about 1,500 families. The project's contribution to
employment would come from regular work generated at the farm level at full
development, and the above figure includes the additional permanent employment
on farms of roughly 650 farm laborers. Furthermore, the family labor utilized
on 355 farms would be increased, thus lowering underemployment at the farm
level. The project would mainly benefit heads of families, hired labor and
campesinos on asentamientos, whose incomes are presently below the poverty
level in Panama.
5.03      A further benefit to the country would come in the form of incre-
mental returns to the Government from taxes and fees, which are estimated to
be of about US$150,000 annually at full development.
5.04      Under the assumptions made in Annex 9, the overall rate of return
of the project is estimated at 20%. A sensitivity analysis, assuming a
shortfall in production of 20%, resulted in an economic rate of return of
12%. Finally, a 10% rate of return was estimated, assuming a decrease of
20% in production and a cost overrun of 20%.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the borrower and
guarantor, that:
(a) the subloan agreement between BNP and PRODEIRHA would include
the assumption of risk and subloan guarantee by Government; that
PRODEIRHA would maintain separate livestock budgets, accounts and
balance sheets and provide auditing and management; that the tech-
nical manager in charge of livestock operations would be appointed
in consultation with the Bank; and that veterinary and other



- 24 -
services would be adequate to ensure the success of the sub-project
(para 3.08);
(b) BNP alone, or in cooperation with other banks, would provide short-
term working capital as required (para 3.14) and that financing and
cost sharing would be as outlined in paragraphs 3.14 and 3.15;
(c) procurement procedures would be followed as outlined in paragraph
3.16;
(d) BNP would retain in its Technical Unit the services of a Project
Director, agricultural economist, dairy production specialist and
an administrative assistant, all acceptable to the Bank, during the
five years of project execution (para 3.20);
(e) BNP would, by February 28, 1978, increase the number of project
technicians of the TU from 14 to a minimum of 20 (para 3.20);
(f) the Project Director would be responsible to the General Manager
of BNP or his designated representative and he would approve all
subloans for presentation to the Credit Committee of BNP; that
subloans in excess of US$100,000 and the PRODEIRHA subloan would be
submitted to the Bank for prior approval; that all subloans would
be based on viable farm plans and that no subloan would finance
more than 55% for the purchase of young (under three years) breeding

SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJFCT
The Agricultural Sector
A. General
Acriculture in the Economy
1.        Opportunities for economic development have been greater in the
n,on-agricultural than in the general sector. Wlhereas real GDP has increased
at an annual rate of 6.8% from 1950-54 to 1970-74, agricultural GDP has
increased at a rate of onlv 4.2% over the same period (Table 1).
2.        The econ6mic and social attractions of non-agricultural activities
have syphoned off a large proportion of the economically active population
from rural to urban occupations, so that the economically active population
in agriculture increased from 163,000 in 1960 to only 177,000 in 1974 (0.6%
per annum), while in the same period in the non-agricultural sector, the
increase was from 172,000 to 334,000 (4.9% per annum). Hience, the proportion
of the economically active labor force in general agriculture has declined
from 48.5% in 1960 to 34.5% in 1974 (Table 2).
3.        The agricultural sector has been able to supply most of the food
products required to feed the domestic population. Imports of agricultural
Droducts in 1975 amounted to US$73.2 million (8.3% of total imports), repre-
senting a decline from 12% in 1973 and 10.6% in 1974. The agriculture sector
is also the source of the bulk of the country's merchandise exports. In
1973, out of a total export value of US$135.3 million, US$103.8 million, or
76.7%, represented agricultural products. This proportion declined sharply
in 1974 to 52.1%' and in 1975, to 50.2% due largely to the distorting effect
of high petroleum export prices and the decline in banana exports (Table 3).
4.        On halance, a2riculture directly earns more foreign exchange than
it absorbs -- exports in 1975 totalling US$139.5 million as compared with
imports of USS73.2 million. However, if imports of agricultural inputs are
included (fuel, fertilizer, insecticides, machinery and spare parts, and the
like), the surplus may be largely eliminated.
Population and Rural Poverty
5.        Panama's population grew in the 1970-74 period at a rate of 2.9%
per annum reaching about 1,618,000 by 1974. The current rate of growth is
3.1% per annum. Of this total, 50% lived in rural areas in 1974 (59% in
1970), with an annual rate of growth of about 1.8%, while the comparable rate
of grw:tlh for the urban population was 4.3% per annum (Table 2). 175,000 or
35% (, i-He total economically active population was engaged in agricultural



ANNEX 1
Page 2
activities in 1970 as compared with 49% (160,000) in 1960.  The slow gro,t+ o:F
agricuLtiiral employment, coupled withi the growth in output, raised labor
productivity of the sector at a greater rate than the rest of the ecunom',
thus narrowing the gap in value added per worker between agricultural an:{
non-agricultural activities.
6.        While agriculture is not always associated with low incomes, the
poorest districts in Panama are primarily agricultural. These districts
are located in remote areas of difficult access. Physical isolation res-
tricts marketing opportunities and results in a high dependence on sub-
sistence agriculture. The Government study defines as extreme poverty, a
total annual income of less than US$200 per person. In 1970, about 58% of
rural families were below this income level. However, living conditions of
many farmers, have been improved by Government programs to extend health and
education services to low-income districts, and current welfare indicators
(other than income) suggest that conditions of extreme poverty affect about
300,000 persons, i.e., only 40% of the rural population or 20% of Panama's
total population.
Employment
7.        There is virtually no open unemployment in the sector.  An average
of 98.8% of the total economically active population in agriculture was
employed in the period 1970-74, and at periods of peak labor demand there
is an absolute labor shortage, especially in the commercial sectors. Under-
employment is estimated to be equivalent to an unemployment rate of about
37% of the total labor force (Table 2).
8.        The rapid economic growth of Panama, and the wage structure pre-
dominant in the Canal Zone, banana plantations, and the commercial and
financial sectors, have resulted in an important increase of farm wages.
The minimum rate in 1976 for unskilled rural labor is US$3 per day, plus
30% for social security, vacations, and such, making Panama the highest
agricultural labor-cost country in Central America.
Land Use and Land Tenure
9.        There are about 1.5 million ha in Panama suitable for various types
of crops, and 3 million hectares are suitable for grazing. 1/ This total of
4.5 million ha is equivalent to 60% of the total area of Panama, but only
21% of the estimated potential crop land and 46% of grazing land, were in
actual use in 1970 (Table 4). Due to the availability of land, increases in
agricultural output during the period 1960-70 resulted from an extension of
the areas in crops and pasture. The increase of farm production by clearing
virgin land was particularly evident for cattle production, and it is esti-
mated that most increases in meat production have been from expanded pasture
land and not from intensification.

10.       During the 1950s, total land in crops expanded by approximately
140,000 ha (56.0%) while in the same period, land devoted to pastures
increased by 270,000 ha. From 1960 to 1970, land devoted to pasture con-
tinued to increase (partially at the expense of crop land) at a slower
rate than in the preceding period, but still at a faster rate than the
total rate of increase of land in overall productive use. A result of
the changes in the pattern of land use in the period 1950-60, was that
land devoted to crops represented only 15% of the total land being farmed
in 1970 (down from 21% in 1950), while land in pasture increased from 48%
in 1950 to 54% in 1970 (Table 4).
11.       Almost all rural families in Panama own or occupy a parcel of
land, and virtually all of the land is owner-operated, with only 5% of
the land being rented.  The absence of a land use and ownership policy and
the prevalence of slash-and-burn farming are reflected in the fact that
almost half of the land in farms and nearly three quarters of the farm
units have no legal title. Overall, 72% of the farms and 44% of the farm
land were untitled in 1970 (Table 5). Close to 80% of all the land in
farms of less than 10 ha lacks legal title as compared with 63% in 10- to
200-ha range, and only 25% of the land in holdings over 200 ha. 1/

ANNEX 1
Page 4
12.       The absence of title reflects a traditional lack of concern with
formal ownership rights stemming from an ample frontier. Nevertheless, due
t&) the limits of the frontier, tenure insecurity asssociated with the lack
o: -itle is becoming an important problem that must be solved, especially
as future increases in output have to originate from increases in produc-
tivity of land now in use, and credit is required for fixed investments in
land. The current direct costs of obtaining title to a 20-ha farm, including
survey, is over 1TSS300, an amount usually beyond a small farmer's means, but
which, nevertheles-;, can be financed through long-term development credits,
including those av:iiLable under the First Livestock Project.
13.       Farms of 200 ha or more represent only 1.3% of all farms over 0.5
ha, but control nearly 35% of the farm land (Table 5). Medium-sized hold-
ings, 20 to 2nO ha, about one-fourth of the holdings, control almost 50%
of the land. There are some 41,000 holdings between 0.5 and 5 ha and
14,000 plots of under 0.5 ha which house the rural "landless" labor force,
a total of 55,000 holdings. Most families occupying these holdings either
produce largely for auto-consumption or obtain the bulk of their income as
agricultural laborers, or a combination of the two.
Recent Sector Performance
14.       The performance of the agricultural sector 1/ between 1970-75 was
erratic and relatively poor, with an average rate of growth of 2.9% per annum.
In the 1970-73 period, the sector output grew at 3.5% per annum, it declined
in 1974 (-0.77a), increasing to 5.4% per annum in 1975. In this year, the
value of crop production rose by 7.6% due mainly to a record crop in sugar and
rice, increases in banana production and modest gains in other crops. The
combined rate of growth of the crop and livestock subsectors was up to 3.2% in
the 1970-75 period, however, during this period the crop subsector had an ave-
rage rate of growth of 3.6% per annum while the comparable rate for the live-
stock subsector was of 0.4% per annum.
15.       Sugarcane and rice have been the most dynamic elements of growth in
the crop subsector. In response to a steep rise in foreign demand, and a
liheral US import policy, sugarcane production grew from an average of 0.90
million metric tons (1966-70) to 1.70 million metric tons in 1975 (17% per
annum), due to both an increase in area planted and productivity. Similarly
rice production has shown a steady increase from an average 0.11 million
metric tons in 1965-69 to 0.18 million metric tons in 1976. By contrast,
problems related to land reform and export taxes on bananas (both solved in
January 1976) caused a decline in production and exports (1971-74) of this
crop, while the secular stagnation of beans and corn production continues.
16.       The Livestock subsector contribution to the GDP of the sector is of
about 15% (1975). Cattle production (beef and milk) account for about 46% of
total livestock production, with the balance being derived from poultry, and
1/   Incldiing fisheries and forestry.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
pigs. Estimates of output of livestock products are considered comparatively
unreliable, expecially in regards to short term changes. Nevertheless, there
is some evidence that indicate that the overall rate of growth of livestock,
which was about 5% per annum in the 1960s, has stabilized or declined during
the past five years, with some important increases in poultry and to a lesser
extent, pork production.
17.       During the 1960s, cattle numbers expanded at an annual rate of 5.5%
per annum. During the 1970-75 period, the rate of increase went down to 2.7%
per annum, and the increase during the 1973-75 period was only 1.4% per annum.
Beef production, however continued to increase up to 1972 (40,600 metric
tons). It fell in 1973, increasing from 1974 to 1976 to an estimated total
production of 45,000 metric tons for this last year. Due to the dual nature
of the herd, the reduction in the rate of growth was accompanied by a decrease
in milk production. Thus total milk production declined from a peak of 74
million liters in 1971 to as low as 62 million in 1974 increasing to 70
million in 1975 (forecast).
18.       There is no clear explanation, and a number of domestic and foreign
constraints are given to explain the recent trends in cattle production:
First, the agrarian reform program in the books since 1962 and initiated in
1968, brought about in the first years of the 1970s certain degree of uncer-
tainty to cattle farming that affected investment in the subsector. Second, a
severe drought in 1972-73 cut heavily in herd numbers, especially breeding
cows. Third, the reduction of the breeding herd coincided with the upswing of
the world market for beef and brought about an increase in the extraction rate
that in turn affected the future growth of the herd. Fourth, to avoid
further deterioration of the cattle growth potential and in order to supply
adequately the domestic market the Government imposed partial embargoes on
beef exports. The embargoes and the fact that domestic prices at that time
(1971-74) were clearly below the international prices affected the confidence
of producers in the future of the industry in Panama. Fifth, the cattle
industry has been affected by a cost/price squeeze due to the combined effect
of increases in most agricultural inputs, and the lack of flexibility and the
lags in the adjustment of the price control schemes. Finally, some of the
best pasture land has moved into more rentable production of sugarcane and
rice, with an implicit overall reduction of productivity and production.
19.       The main constraint that stands out from the above explanations is an
overall inefficiency of the cattle industry in Panama. This arises from poor
management practices at the farm level and the absence of a long term Govern-
ment development and investment policies in the areas of research, extension
and pricing. The cattle industry in Panama developed and grew quite rapidly
on the basis of expanding the agricultural frontier. It is estimated 1/ that
virtually all the increases (1950-70) in beef output and most of the milk have
come about from an expanded pasture area. In spite of the fact that only 46%
of the potential grazing land is currently being utilized 1/, the spontaneous

ANNEX 1
Page 6
expansion of the agricultural frontier is coming to an end and the bulk of a-,
future increases in production will have to come from an increased use of
technology and better management of the land actually in use.

Government Policies and Programs for the Agricultural Sector
21.       There was practically no Government action on agricultural or
agrarian policy until the 1950s, when concern with promoting farm production
and employment led to the creation of the Instituto de Fomento Economico (IFT
IFE set domestic prices on livestock and basic staples as well as controlled
the imports of the latter. Agrarian reform became part of Panama's agricul-
tural policy with the Agrarian Code of 1962 and the formation of the Comissic
de Reforma Agraria (CRA).
22.       In January 1973, a completed reorganization of the public institu-
tions of the sector was initiated by Law #12 which created the Ministerio de
Desarrollo Agropecuario (MIDA) and the Banco de Desarrollo Agricola (BDA).
This law, in fact, abolished IFE and the CRA; IFE marketing functions were
absorbed by MIDA's National Marketing Bureau, and the credit functions by BDA-
CRA's functions were redistributed among MIDA's National Directorate for
Agrarian Reform, Production and Social Development. Later, in December 1975,
an autonomous marketing institution was created, Instituto de Mercadeo Agro-
pecuario, replacing MIDA's National Marketing Bureau, and responsible for the
implementation of price support policies and marketing operations in both
local and foreign markets.
23.       Recently there has been a gradual shift of emphasis to marketing,
production and exports. Initially, agricultural policy was primarily directe:
to raising the living standard of the poorest campesinos and integrating then
into the political life of the nation. Later on, emphasis was placed on
increasing output and more recently on rationalizing technology. In additio-
heavy emphasis has been placed on supporting group-farming, thus, ending the
rather ineffective technical assistance previously provided to individual
individual small and middle size farmers.
24.       This gradual shift in emphasis reflects growing concern over the
increasing cost of agricultural imports. The current push towards agricul-
tural self-sufficiency is centered in productivity improvements, import
substitution and export promotion, although it continues with agrarian refoL
and efforts to improve the economic, social and political position of the
low income farmers. Recently, more emphasis is being given to non-land
aspects of rural poverty: improved management, the supply of capital, markl
ing, and the nawver-ent capabilities of the Juntas Agrarias de Produccion
Asentamientos.  -;   is also evident in the emphasis now being given L( Lhc-

Juntas Agrarias de Produccion which have a wider local base than the Asenta-
mientos, and in the preoccupation of MIDA with export processing plants, and
infrastructural facilities.
Agrarian Reform
25.       Little was undertaken in agrarian reform until after the October
1968 revolution. The activities of CRA in the 1963-68 period consisted mainly
of the planning and programming of the agrarian reform process and the acqui-
sition of 9,500 ha and the issuance of land titles. Since 1969, a total of
430,000 ha 1/ have been acquired, representing about 365 properties and 21% of
the land in farms in 1970. In addition a total of approximately 11,000 titles
have been issued in the period 1963 - April 1975. To a large extent most of
the land acquired for agrarian reform is located outside of the heavily
populated Azuero peninsula and the relatively rich Chiriqui Province. The
process of land acquisition, however, slowed down considerably after 1972.
Total land acquisition between 1973 and August 1975 was about 88,000 ha, 80%
of which was related to the Bayano Project; reservoir, watershed protection
and a state farming project.
26.       The above leads to the conclusion that the process of land reform
is slowing down, and Government action is expanding into wider scope programs
with heavy emphasis in group farming and the promotional activities of MIDA
are assuming national scope (see below). The emphasis now appears in the
consolidation of holdings and the concentration of strategic areas given
the limited administrative capacity and the budgetary constraints of the
public sectors.
27.       There were, in mid-1975, 201 Asentamientos 2/ comprising 5,688
families and 68 Juntas Agrarias de Produccion. In both cases the assurance of
public services, available only for group farming, was an important incentive
for group farming. After the 1973 reorganization, MIDA's coordinators were
assigned to each Asentamiento or group of neigboring Asentamientos, with respon-
sibilities in the area of production and social assistance. Group credit for
joint community and cooperative production, is the responsibility of BDA.
Therefore, practically all the credit received by the collectives came from
BDA who is responsible for dealing especially with the approval, disbursement,
and collection of credit. Production and credit planning, technical assistance
and supervision is the responsibility of MIDA's field officers. Many collec-
tive farms have been quite successful especially in rice, using capital inten-
sive methods made possible by the availability of credit and the technical

as 7,000 ha from the United Brands in the Chiriqui Province.

assistance of MIDA. In the 1974/75 crop year, these group farming projects
in addition to minor quantities of corn, beans and mill, produced an equiva-
lent to 20% of the marketable domestic rice production.
28.       What kind of tenure arrangement will finally emerge from the Asen-
tamientos is not yet clear as up to now, the members have only informal and
collective temporary rights. The present system provides for a five year
trial period during which the members decide by majority vote who remain in
the collective and who has to be expelled from the Asentamiento. By the end
of the five-year period, definite titles are to be issued. The question of
repayment, the price of the land and of improvements paid by the GOP, has not
yet been decided. Neither has the type of tenure under which the titles are
to be issued. While GOP policies and programs encourage collective management
of land, the actual subdivision of the land is up to each Asentamiento. At
present, land management in the Asentamientos ranges from primarily individual,
to totally collective.
Current Government Strategy
29.       Recently GOP has made a significant commitment to improve the per-
formance of the agricultural sector. In an attempt to increase food production,
the GOP has designated agriculture as a key development sector and is giving
greater support by the way of technical assistance, credit and marketing and
processing services. The Government basic program includes minimum and support
prices, import and export controls, retail price ceilings and direct market
operations.
30.       Current development goals and strategy for the agricultural sector
are reflected in the preliminary report of the 1976-80 development plan 1/
published by the Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy. Unpublished sec-
tions on crops, livestock, forestry and fisheries are now in draft form.
The general policy objectives focus on:
(a) the maximization of agriculture's contribution to the economy
through import substitution and exports;
(b) raising employment, income and living levels of the sector
with special emphasis on the rural poor;
(c) incorporating the hinterland into the nation's economic and
social life promoting the achievement of a better socio-economic
equilibrium between urban and rural areas; and
(d) furthering the rehabilitation and conservation efforts of the
renewable natural resources.

31.       Agricultural output is to be raised by 5.7% per annum (1976-80
period), and recognizing that the domestic market will not sustain the tar-
get growth rate, agricultural exports are to be expanded and diversified.
Emphasis is placed on production of sugar, beef, fruits, vegetables and
tobacco (exports), and pork, poultry, milk, feedgrains, beans and oilseeds
(import substitution).
32.       The basic goals related to income, employment and to the general
improvement of the living standards of the rural poor are to materialize
through the Government's new regional development strategy. This strategy
reiies in the integrated rural development approach based in the short run,
and the development of the agricultural sector. The integrated rural develop-
ment represents a broadening of the agrarian reform program to include the
organization of the small landholders into agrarian production associations,
but with increased emphasis on management improvements, marketing, agro-
industrial infrastructure and social aspects.
33.       In recent years, Panama has been relying heavily on external assist-
ance to heip to impiement its policies in the development of the rural areas
and the sectors. There is a growing awareness that these efforts require an
overall strategy and new institutional tools to incorporate the agricultural
policy within a broader national rural development strategy. This strategy
together with the regionalization of the country is being developed by the
Ministry of Planning and MIDA, with the assistance of UNDP/FAO, USAID and
ILPES. Recent events related to the decentralization of the planning and
implementing machinery are the transfer of MIDA to Santiago, the creation of
new local institutions such as Juntas Locales and Juntas Comunales and the
creation of six autonomous regional development cooperations. 1/
34.       In addition the GOP has recently became involved in agricultural
long-term planning and policy with the implementation of a long-term planning
exercise for the sector "Perspectivas Para el Desarrollo Agropecuario en
Panama" 2/ founded by UNDP/FAO and assistance from USAID. In addition to the
plan, commodity reports on milk and palm oil, indicative norms for regional
specialization of farming, and two regional projects (milk in Chiriqui and
African palm in Colon) have been issued. The overall plan, although indica-
tive in nature, is a very useful document and reflects the GOP involvement in
agricultural long-term planning and policy. Panama has requested from UNDP a
two years extension of the project to: (a) prepare medium- and short-term
plans, and (b) create a permanent capability for continuous agricultural
planning in MIDA.

35.       The agriculturally centered ruraL development plans of Panama are
strongly affected hy technological bottlenecks. Sector analysis has shown
that adaptive agricultural research, technical training and farmer education
are among the principal constraints to agricultural development in Panama.
To overcome this problem and the shortage of trained personnel, the GOP
initiated a complete revision of the organization and structure of the public
agricultural research activities and created in 1975 a semi-autonomous
Agricultural Research Institute (IDIAP). All funds and personnel previously
assigned to a number of different public institutions are being transferred
to IDIAP with the exception of those assigned for agricultural research to
the Universidad Nacional. The focus of IDIAP research will be small and
medium size farmers; emphasis will be placed in the transfer of technology
resulting from applied research.
B. The Livestock Sub-Sector
General
36.       Panama covers an area of 7.7 1/ million ha of which approximately
1.1 million ha is classified as pasture land, the greater part of which
(84.6% is shown as "sown" 2/ pastures. This pasture land supports the
country's beef and dairy herds comprising some 1,348,000 head in 1975
(Table 7). The main livestock producing areas are located on the Pacific
watershed west of the canal, with a cattle distribution as shown below:

1/   Includes 0.14 million ha in the Canal Zone area leased to and adminis-
tered by the United States.

37.       The dominant topographic feature of the country is the long chain of
mountains (Cordillera Central) extending along its center from the western
border with Costa Rica through to the canal where it becomes more broken, and
then into the eastern half where it finally peters out in the Province of
Darien. Mountain peaks higher than 2,000 m are located in the two western
provinces with the highest, Volcan Baru, reaching 3,475 m in altitude. Eleva-
tion strongly influences the rainfall incidence throughout the country, which
varies from around 1,000 mm annually in the lower parts of the Azuero penin-
sula to over 5,000 mm around the mountain peaks in the northern part of the
Province of Chiriqui. Rainfall incidence is substantially higher along the
Atlantic watershed than on the Pacific side.
38.       Rainfall pattern has a marked seasonal distribution with a pronounced
dry period, varying from only two months in the most favored areas up to five
to six months in the lower rainfall areas. The last effective rains occur
about the middle of December, and in the driest areas the season does not
"break" until May. The risk of a false break, when a follow-up rain may not
occur within a week, is quite high. During the wet season, the rainfall pat-
tern shows a distinct trough in July and August, and then peaks markedly during
October and November. Temperatures are high and relatively constant through-
out the year, but decrease with increased elevation.
39.       Soils are old, heavily leached, low in organic matter, phosphorus
and nitrogen. Pockets of deficiencies of other major and minor elements, prin-
cipally sulphur, molybdenum, manganese and iron, have been identified. The
soils are acidic, pH 5.0 - 6.0, with the major portion in the lower range, pH
5.0 - 5.5. Natural drainage is generally adequate for agricultural purposes,
except on parts of the plains adjacent to the coast in the Azuero peninsular
where poor surface drainage has resulted in small pockets of salt deposits.
Pastures
40.       Hyparrhenia rufa, known locally as Faragua, is ubiquitous on most
cleared land in the country and survives at very low soil nutrient levels.
On the more fertile soils in the higher rainfall areas in the Province of
Chiriqui, Indiana (Panicum maximum) and Kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum)
flourish on recently cleared land. Para (Brachiaria mutica) tends to occur on
land with poor drainage and of medium to high fertility. All species respond
to improved soil nutrient status, however, several introduced species have
been found to outyield some of the local pasture plants at the higher nutrient
levels. Notable among these are several Brachiaria species, B. decumbens,
Tanner (B. rugulosa), which can replace Hyparrhenia in the drier areas,
and Star Grass (Cynodon pneufluensis), Setaria (Setaria splendida), and King
Grass (Sacharum sinensis), which are highly productive under better moisture
and fertility conditions. King-grass is useful as a special purpose fodder
crop. Regrowth of brush and undergrowth, most of which is inedible by animals,
constitutes a productive constraint in the higher rainfall areas and requires
constant attention to keep the pastures clean.



ANNEX 1
Page 12
41.       Tropical legumes are found only infrequently in most pastures, due
presumably to the low nutrient status of the soils. Introduced species such
as Kudzu (Pueraria phaseoloides), Stylo (Stylosanthes guyanensis) and Centro
(Centrosema pubescens) thrive under improved soils nutrient conditions, but
their use with grass species on a field scale is still at the experimental
level. The distribution of pastures by province is as follows:

42.       The encroachment on pasture land by the demands of crops, princi-
pally for expansion of the sugar industry, is pressing the livestock industry
further into previously unexploited scrub and forest land, requiring large
investments at the farm level.  Currently the climatically favored, but rela-
tively undeveloped undulating to hilly land in the western central area
around the town of Rio Sereno in the Province of Chiriqui is being improved
for livestock production in response to this type of pressure.
43.       Partly in response to pressure to open up more pasture land, but
largely on social development grounds, the Government is grouping together
the previously scattered families in the forest lands of the Atlantic water-
shed into community development projects, with the main emphasis on clearing
land for livestock production. Commencing in 1969, the program, which is
supervised by the military, has already substantial success in the area
around the northern boundary of the Province of Cocle, where some eight to
ten settlements, comprising about 500 families have been established.

45.        Average rate of growth of cattle numbers has been about 2.5% per
year since 1967. In the dairy sub-sector, an annual increase of 5.80% in
number of cows being milked was also estimated. At the same time, meat pro-
duction, as measured by the number of head slaughtered, increased by 4.8%
per annum, while milk production per cow milked and in total declined by 29.6%
(7.4% per year) and 13% (2.6%), respectively, as illustrated below:

46.       The table below indicates the distribution of all cattle by size of
farm. Dairy production tends to be concentrated on small- to medium-sized
farm units.

Animal Health
47.       Animal health problems are less serious in Panama than in countries
further south. There is no foot-and-mouth disease in the country and the
Government is concerned with preventing its entry. Likewise the Government
has a comprehensive program aimed at eradicating both Brucellosis and TB in
the national herd. Internal and external parasites are the causes of the
main health problems, especially among imported temperate breed dairy animals.
Local Zebu and crossbred animals are relatively resistant to tick borne
diseases and screw worm infestation.
Transport Facilities
48.       The Inter-American highway which traverses the main agricultural
and livestock production zones is the backbone of the transport system in
Panama. Most areas are linked with this trunk road by good all weather roads
allowing rapid transport of cattle, beef and milk. There still remain a few
areas on the fringe of the developing zones which are still not yet served by
an adequate road network. Of particular importance to the dairy sector is the
frontier region of Rio Sereno in the Province of Chiriqui where transport
facilities are inadequate and restrict rapid development. This is, nonethe-
less, particularly suited to dairy production.



ANNEX 1
Page 15
Technical Assistance
49.       Extension advisory services to farmers are provided by both State
and by non-state sources, the latter principally through the banking system.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development (MIDA) is the main State
source and is limited generally to crop production and the technical advance-
ment of the collective communities and the community development projects in
the Atlantic watershed. The two main Government banks provide the greater
part of the technical assistance to agriculture in Panama. These are the
Banco de Desarrollo Agropecuario and the Banco Nacional de Panama (BNP), which
have both established agricultural technical sections within their structure
to appraise and oversee their loans made to agriculture. Technical staff
include veterinarians, agronomists, economist and specific specialists. The
most effective technical service to the livestock sector is that provided by
the Project Technical Unit of the BNP, which, through a network of 10 to 12
regional offices provides an intensive and comprehensive technical and manage-
ment service for the development programs of its clients from appraisal to
completion.
Research
50.       The Institute for Agricultural Research (IDIAP), an autonomous body
within MIDA, is the principal applied research organization in the country,
although the University of Panama does carry out some work with both crops
and livestock. IDIAP is presently the subject of a consultant study aimed
at its reorganization and reorientation towards satisfying the future needs
for agricultural research in the country.
51.       The main center for livestock and pasture research is located at
Gualaca in the Province of Chiriqui. This station, with about 540 ha of
typical undulating open savannah, has research programs in the areas of
species evaluation, fertilizer and pasture management; mineral deficiencies
in cattle, steer fattening, and calf rearing trials, nearly all located at
the center. Inadequate funds and staff do not allow a comprehensive program
of regional field tests. By means of regular field days, and publication of
results, it has established some contact with livestock producers. Contact
with the technical extension services of the banks has been sporadic, but
there has developed closer collaboration with the personnel of the Technical
Unit of the First Livestock Development Project. Main objective is to assist
the research workers to more easily determine research priorities, and at the
same time facilitate the flow of research information to the farmer clients
of the project.
52.       As part of the campaign to encourage dairy production IMIDA has
recently established a nucleus of technical specialists under the national
plan for dairy development. This unit is made up of university grduates to
be trained in dairy husbandry whose special function will be to give advice
to the dairy farmers throughout the country. At present there are seven
technicians most of whom are liaising closely with the Project Technical
Unit field operators.



ANNEX 1
Page 16
Artificial Insemination Facilities
53.       While the general breeding method of mating is with the bull running
with the cows all the year, there is a well-established artificial insemina-
tion service available. This is operated by private firms using imported
semen. It is mainly used by specialized milk producers.
Production Methods
54.       Beef Breeding and Fattening.  This is the dominant activity, with
about 75% of total breeding cows used solely for meat production. Almost all
cows are Zebu or predominantly of this breed. Although there are notable ex-
ceptions, most farms have minimum capital improvements and low management
levels. Average farm size is estimated to be greater than 100 ha. Bulls are
run with the cows all the year, calving rates are about 50% and steers are
sold at 30-36 months. Cows are culled for age at 10 to 11 years. As a
supplementary activity in the more climatically favored areas, 12-month old
steers from the dual purpose breeders are purchased and fattened.
55.       Dual Purpose Dairy/Beef Production.  This is the most common system
of milk production in the country involving an estimated 90% of all milking
cows (120,600). Farm size for this activity is smaller than for beef breed-
ing averaging about 50 ha per farm. About 70% of dual purpose production is
concentrated in the Provinces of Chiriqui, Herrera and Los Santos. An essen-
tial characteristic of this form of production is that the cows are milked
once per day (in the morning) and the calves suckle for six to eight hours
and then are removed each day until weaning at six to eight months. Male
calves are sold at 12 months to fatteners and the female calves reared as
replacement breeders, usually with little selection. Cows are cross-bred
animals based on the Zebu types, crossed with Holstein or Brown Swiss.
56.       Management levels and investment in farm improvements are low to the
point of very primitive on many farms. Production is correspondingly low with
calving rates between 50 and 60%; milk production is from 2.5-3.0 liters/day,
but slightly higher in the more favored Province of Chiriqui. In Chiriqui
the herds are milked all year round, but in the drier, central provinces there
is a tendency to dry off the cows for the summer to avoid having to feed them
during this period. Production is encouraged in these areas during the summer
by a slightly higher price for industrial grade milk.
57.       Specialized Milk Production.  Specialized milk production is con-
fined to about 40 licensed herds, 33 of which are located in the elevated
regions of the humid Province of Chiriqui. Average farm size is about 50 ha,
although there are several intensive barn-fed operations near Panama City.
Licenses to produce Grade A milk are only granted when: (a) the hygienic
conditions of the milking operations are adequate, and (b) the calf is not
given access to the cow. The required standard of hygiene demands the instal-
lation of such facilities as a manure disposal unit, a potable water supply,
and cooling and storage facilities for up to two days production.



ANNEX 1
Page 17
58.       All specialized milking herds are largely purebred Hoisteins or
Brown Swiss, generally imported from the United States. Despite an extensive
health and acclimatization program coupled with the location of these herds
in the most favored area of the country, milk production per cow rarely ex-
ceeds eight to ten liters/day. The Brown Swiss is the most adaptable of the
two breeds and is thus found more in the lowland areas, but ideally a mixture
of 25% Zebu and 75% Brown Swiss is sought as the combination best adapted
for consistent milk production.
Milk Markets and Marketing
59.       Total milk production in Panama increased at a rate of 2.75% per
annum in the 1960-64 period. Increases of production, however, have been
erratic, rising rapidly from 1965 to 1969 and then declining from 1971 to 1974
and rising again in 1975 (Table 7). Milk reception by plants has remained at
an average of 71.0% of total reported production in the period 1971-74. In-
formation of Estadistica y Censo indicates that, in 1975, about 79% of the
milk was sold as fluid milk, 16% was processed at the farm level and sold as
dairy products, and the remainder was consumed at the farm.
60.       Milk output has not been able to keep up with the growth in domestic
demand, and Panama has to depend more and more on imports of milk products to
supply the local market. The share of imported milk in total domestic supply
more than doubled, increasing from 32 to 77.5 million liters, in the period
1960-74, and representing 41% and 53% of total domestic milk supply, respec-
tively. This increase is reflected in an import bill of milk and milk pro-
ducts of $10.6 million in 1974 (Table 8). According to MIDA's revised supply
and demand projections 1/ (given the historical rate of growth of domestic
production 2.75% per annum for 1960-74), the milk deficit would represent
59% and 63% of total demand for the years 1980 and 1985, respectively, which
would require imports of 113 million liters by 1980, and 152 million by 1985,
to cover deficits and which, at 1974 prices, would represent an import bill
of approximately US$20.8 million by 1985. Projected total milk demand for
1985 is 234 million liters; thus, to eliminate the projected deficit of 152
million liters, local production would have to increase by 11.5% per year
during the period 1974-85.
61.       Milk imports, mostly in the form of skim milk powder, butter oil,
and cheese, are handled either by the industries directly or through
MERCADEO. 2/ Imports of milk ate regulated through import quotas determined
by MIDA and MERCADEO and enforced by the latter. Free imports of milk and
milk products are not expressly forbidden, and the industry can import them
subject to relatively high import duties. However, since imports brought in
under MERCADEO licenses are not subject to duties, practically all the milk

is imported in that way. To date, whenever the landed price of imports has
been lower than domestic prices, the difference has to be paid to MERCADEO in
order to avoid dumping, or excessive profit-taking by the industry.
62.       Skim powder milk is mainly utilized to reconstitute milk for the
fluid market (especially during the dry season), and helps to maintain a
stable supply and a more constant use of plant capacity. Furthermore due to
the increasing scarcity of domestic supplies, milk powder is being utilized
to manufacture other milk products, such as evaporated and condensed milk and
probably some types of cheese.
63.       There are 12 dairy processing plants that are classified as indus-
tries in Panama. Three of these plants produce pasteurized milk and other
subproducts, the rest manufacture only subproducts. As an average in the
period 1971-75, three out of the seven plants for which there is information,
purchased 92% of the total milk sold to plants. 50% of this milk went to
pasteurized milk and subproducts, while the difference went to the manufacture
of subproducts only. There is no apparent problem in relation to either plant
capacity or technology available to process additional production. A study
during 1969 (the highest production year) indicated that plants were operating
at 70% of their installed capacity (at eight-hour day).
64.       Industrial milk from the five main producing western provinces
(Chiriqui, Veraguas, Herrera, Los Santos and Cocle) is mainly processed at
two plants owned by the Nestle's company located at Concepcion in Chiriqui
and Nata in Cocde. The two plants have a combined capacity of about 155,000
liters per day but at present are operating only at about two-thirds capacity
due to lack of milk supplies. Whole milk for human consumption is received
mainly at a bulk reception plant located at Concepcion in Chiriqui Province,
and transported daily to Panama City for processing. This unit also receives
industrial milk from the area which is also sent to Panama City for processing
by the Estrella Azul Company. A small whole milk treatment plant (7,500
1/day) is located at David to supply consumer milk in the Province of Chiriqui
and Bocas del Toro. Both receiving and treatment plants operate at about 50%
of capacity. The milk is collected once daily (mornings) by a network of
collection trucks, except in a few areas where Grade A milk is collected every
other day.
65.       Cattle slaughter facilities for domestic killing are located through-
out the country at numerous local abattoirs and at several large killing
centers in Panama City and in the regions. Export meat processing is handled
by several licensed abattoirs, one of the largest being located at David.
This plant handles about 30% of total national slaughtering and 50% of export
sales, but at 500 head per week is only at one-fourth capacity.
66.       Although marketing of livestock products is left to private initia-
tive, the Government plays a major role in marketing through price control
schemes.  To date, Government price policies have been negative for the
dairy industry and in general they tend to favor the consumer through price
stability, while guaranteed farm gate prices have become increasingly less

favorable to producers. Furthermore, the maximum price structure is adjusted
with considerable lag behind price movements (Table 10), and current real
prices (corrected by Panama's Wholesale Price Index) range between 53% (for
grade A milk) and 76% (for industrial milk) of the 1970 price level, bringing
about a decline of producers' real income for the 1970-75 period.
67.       There are two producer price levels:  industrial and Grade A milk.
Industrial milk was fixed in 1970 at US$0.10 per liter, raised to US$0.13 in
1973 and set at US$0.15 in 1974. Grade A milk was, at the same time, raised
proportionally. Current producer price ranges (allowing for spatial and
seasonal price differentials) from US$0.165 to US$0.175 per liter for indus-
trial milk and US$0.23 to US$0.25 per liter for Grade A milk. Mlaximum retail
prices are fixed at US$0.37 per liter for Grade A milk and US$0.265. Whole-
sale prices are US$0.025 less per liter of Grade A and US$0.02 less per liter
for industrial milk.
68.       Grade A milk is produced from about 40 "licensed" dairies, four of
which supply the Canal Zone. The rest of the dairies, which includes about
90% of all the cows milked in Panama, are classified as industrial producers.
Current legal dispositions set standards of milk quality at the consumer and
farm levels, together with minimum standards for on-farm dairy buildings and
production requirements. In view of Panama's environment, needs, and present
status of the industry, the existing standards for a Grade A producer are too
high and have the effect of increasing costs sharply to levels out of reach
of the small farmers. Furthermore, and since farmers cannot obtain better
prices through improvements of milk quality until they are "licensed" as
Grade A producers, current investment requirements are acting as a constraint
for increasing production and quality of milk in Panama. At present, milk
sold to consumers is an "illegal" blend of about 60% of Grade A milk and 40%
of industrial milk, 1/ and this practice has resulted in high profits for
processing plants at the expense of the producers.
69.       Prices received by farmers should basically reflect quality of
milk delivered to plants. It cannot be assumed that quality is the automatic
outcome of investment considerations at the farm level. Worldwide experience
shows that the sanitary quality and the milk supply can be increased over a
few years when a quality payment scheme is introduced. Such changes would
remove an important constraint for improving both production and producer's
income in Panama.
70.       In July 1976, the GOP requested technical assistance from USAID
to improve the basis for its decision process in relation to pricing and the
above-mentioned standards. The study, completed by the end of September,
recommended the modification of the current standards and the implementa-
tion of a quality payment scheme based on a multiple grade system, without
necessarily increasing prices paid by consumers. This system permits
pDroducers to capitalize through improved quality of milk delivered to plants,
and at the same time allows for a gradual implementation of marginal on-farm
investments.

The Banking System and Agricultural Credit
Introduction
1.        The banking and monetary system in Panama is dissimilar from that of
the Latin American countries. There is no separate central bank; foreign banks
dominate the private sector; the monetary system is closely linked to the US
dollar; currency is freely convertible and there is a constant, sometimes
large and unpredictable movement of funds into and out of the country. The
banking system is regulated by the General Banking Law of Panama, Decree Law
No. 238 of July 2, 1970, which became effective in 1971. This Decree reformed
the banking system and created a National Banking Commission which is author-
ized to administer reforms established under Decree 238, issue licenses for
new banks, supervise bank operations and also propose legislative and other
measure for the operation of the banking system. The Commission also admin-
isters monetary policy.
The Banking Structure
2.        Banks in Panama are of two types, depending on their scope of busi-
ness in the country and consist of:
(a) those with a general license (GLB's) issued to banks
organized under Panamanian laws and to authorized
branches of foreign banks, permitting such banks to
engage in banking operations both within and outside
Panama; and
(b) these with an international license (ILB's) authorizing
banks organized under Panamanian laws and branches of
foreign banks to conduct, from an office established
in Panama, only these transactions which are completed,
accomplished or are intended to take effect outside
Panama.
3.        At the end of March 1976, there were a total of 46 banks operating in
Panama; 28 of which were GLB's and 18 were ILB's. The ILB's maintained head-
quarters offices only. GLB's on the other hand, operated 184 offices through-
out the country, as shown below:

Because of the commercial nature of the business of private banks, their
offices are concentrated in the cities of Panama and Colon. The Banco
Nacional de Panama (BNP), almost singlehandedly, services the rural areas.
4.        As mentioned, the unique feature of the Panamanian banking system
is that it has no central bank nor does it have an institution of monetary
issue. The national currency is the "Balboa", which is equivalent to one
U.S. dollar. There are no printed balboa currency notes as such and U.S.
dollar notes and coins circulate freely and are legal tender. A small
issue of balboa coins of various denominations supplements the total circu-
lation. The fixed rate of exchange of the balboa to the U.S. dollar is
maintained without artificial devices of intervention in international
payments and trade.
5.        The banking system as overseen by the National Banking Commission
(NBC) is administratively under the Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy.
NBC's seven members are appointed by Government and day-to-day business is
handled by a Technical Secretariat under an Executive Secretary. The legal
objectives of the NBC are as follows:



ANNEX 2
Page 3
(a) to insure that the solidity and efficiency of the banking
system is maintained to promote monetary and credit condi-
tions conducive to stability and the sustained growth of
the national economy, and.
(b) to strengthen and promote an environment for the develop-
ment of Panama as an international financial center. Among
its more important powers are the authority to license or
close a bank, to set the rates for reserve against deposits,
to determine the minimum balance of liquid assets which
banks must maintain, to fix interest rates on savings
deposits, and also the interest rates that banks may charge
on local loans and on credit that they may grant.
6.        In the absence of an institution of last resort (a central bank,
for instance), the General Banking Law provides for certain safeguards:
(a) Paid-in capital:
(i) a minimum capital of US$1 million for foreign-
controlled GLBs and US$250,000 for Panamanian
controlled ones;
(ii) ILBs are not subject to minimum capital require-
ments, but must post a permanent guarantee of
US$250,000 in assets free from encumbrances and
kept in Panama.
(b) Net worth to risk assets ratio:
(i) under the law, paid-in capital plus surplus re-
serves shall be not less than 4% of a GLB's
productive assets;
(ii) by NBC regulation, paid-in capital plus surplus
reserve shall be not less than the following
percentages in relation to their domestic pro-
ductive assets 1/: (a) 5% for GLBs with assets
of up to US$30 million- (b) 4.5% for those with
assets of up to US$45 million; and (c) 4% for
those with assets of more than US$45 million.
(c) Contingency line of credit:
With the exception of the official banks, GLBs
must be the beneficiary of a contingent credit
in U.S. dollars granted by a foreign bank (or
its head office in the case of a branch of a
1/   Under the law, "loans and investments placed economically in the
Republic of Panama".



ANNEX 2
Page 4
foreign bank) equal to not less than 10% of
their productive assets. The NBC may require
a GLB to use its contingent line of credit if
during a period of six months, withdrawal of
deposits from the GLB exceeds 10% of the total.
(d) Pool of resources:
When any GLB encounters liquidity problems due to
a decrease in deposits, the NBC is empowered to
enter into negotiations with the GLB in question
and the other GLBs of the system regarding the
granting of a special short-term credit by the
latter in favor of the former.
(e) Working reserves:
The law empowers the NBC to set the amount of
"liquid" assets which banks must maintain as a
percentage of their total deposits. These may
not be higher than 12% for mortgage banks and
35% for commercial banks. At present, the rates
are 10% and 30% for these banks, respectively.
Liquid assets must be in the form of gold or
legal tender currency in Panama, clearing house
balances, bank deposits or obligations collect-
ible on demand or within six months, Treasury
bills and other Government securities with a
maturity of not more than one year due from
foreign banks on demand or within six months
maturity, unmatured bills of exchange of six
months maturity, bonds of foreign government
or international financial organization, and
other assets which NBC may authorize.
In financial terms, the growth of GLBs and ILBs is shown in Tables I
and 2.
Lending Operations 1/
7.        Lending operations of GLBs have risen tremendously from a total of
nearly US$2.2 billion in 1972 to US$9 billion and USS8.8 billion in 1974 and
1/   Since all operations of ILBs are restricted to those outside Panama,
hereafter, discussions are confined to GLBs. It should be noted,
however, that from 1974, ILBs have been permitted to make deposits
in or lend to GLBs, but the volume of these transactions have been
relatively small so far, due obviously to the ability of most GLBs
to borrow directly from international markets.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
1975 respectively (Table 3). This rise reflects the rapid growth of Panama
as a regional financial center. The percentage distribution of lending is
shown below:
Domestic Loans              Foreign
Private     Public      Sub-      Loans        Total
Year                Sector       Sector      total    Sub-total   Loans
1972                 45.3         1.4       46.7         53.3       100
1973                 36.6         1.7       38.3         11.7       100
1974                 21.6         1.4       23.0         77.0       100
1975                 19.0         2.6       21.6         78.4       100
Roughly, lending by official banks accounted for about 14% in 1972, 13% in
9.6% in 1974 1/.  This trend is because the banking system has been granting
more and more loans to foreign borrowers, mainly by private banks. The share
of official banks would have been much less if it were not for the fact that
lending to the public sector rose from US$30.6 million in 1972 to US$224.2
in 1975.
8.        Although the relative share of loans to the domestic private sector
have gone down during the period, in absolute terms, total loans granted have
increased from US$988 million in 1972 to US$1,947 million and US$1,427 mil-
lion in 1974. The various economic activities assisted were the following:

Although it would seem that financial assistance to agriculture, livestock,
and fisheries have increased importantly, actually this is not so since the
three sub-sectors combined, account for only 8% to 9% of total loans granted
by GLBs. Furthermore, from a development view point, it must be remembered
that GLBs are basically commercial banks and, necessarily, the great majority
of their loans are for seasonal production and not for improvement or enlarge-
ment of production facilities. However, both the agricultural and industrial
sectors have benefitted from Decree Law 95 of 1974 which set a ceiling on
interest rates to these sectors at 8% and 9% respectively. The rapid rise in
lending for housing and other construction has been influenced in great
measure by the provision in the General Banking Law (Article 33) which requires
that at least 50% of domestic savings deposits received should be invested in
housing loans of not less than 10 years maturity or in forms of indebtedness
issued by the National Mortgage Bank of the Republic of Panama.
9.        Under the law, the NBC has the power to fix the maximum rate of
interest which, directly or indirectly, may be charged by a bank on local loans
or credits. With the exception of Decree Law 95 which set the interest rates
on agricultural and industrial loans, the NBC has chosen to let market forces
determine such rates. Accordingly, loan interest rates have a close relation-
ship to the inter-bank rate in London (LIBR), and are generally set at 1% to 3%
over such rates. Although no statistics are available on loan charges applied
by banks, the following schedule of the BNP, current as of May 1976, gives an
indication of the loan interest rate situation (BNP claims that they are about
1% or 2% lower than those charged by other banks).1/

10.       The General Banking Law does not specify the kind of collateral which
are required for loans nor the loan value of collaterals. However, the Law does
provide some safeguards: (a) excepting in specified cases, a bank is prohibited
from lending to any one borrower an amount exceeding 5% of its total deposits,
capital, and surplus reserves; (b) no loan or credit shall be obtained with the
bank's own share as collateral; and (c) no loans or credit without collateral
shall be granted in excess of 15% of the bank's capital and surplus reserves to
persons connected with that bank or to any juridical person or entity in which
one or more of its directors or officers have individually or jointly a majority
interest. These and those described in para 6 are important protective measures
that require the vigilance and technical expertise of the NBC.
Investment Operations
11.       Investments made by the banking system are in the form of obliga-
tions of Government and Government-owned obligations of corporations, both
domestic and foreign. Because of the GLB's heavy reliance on foreign deposits
and borrowings and the legal limitation that no more than 25% of a GLB's capital
plus surplus reserves shall be used to acquire share or interest in non-banking
enterprises (exceptions: corporations organized for insuring bank deposits,
for promoting the development of a money or securities market in Panama, or
improving the financing facilities for economic development), investments,
although on the rise, have been relatively minor in total amount (Table 5).
While investments of official banks have remained fairly stable at around



ANNEX 2
Page  8
US$3.3 million during 1970 to 1975 (mostly in the public sector), those
of private banks have risen from US$6.6 million at the end of 1970 to
US$90.3 million by end of 1975, most of these in foreign investments
(US$0.7 million in 1970 to US$67.4 million in 1975). It would appear that
measures are rLecessary to encourage the flow of such funds into investment
for the development of Panama.
Sources and Cost of Funds
12.        Funds of GLBs come mainly from three sources:  (a) paid-in capital
including accumulated profits; (b) deposits and inter-bank borrowings; and
(c) other borrowings. Table 6 is a summary showing the net sources (and
application) of funds of GLBs during 1971 to 1975. GLBs have become strongly
reliant on foreign sources for their operations (indicative of the banking
system's role as a regional financial center). In 1971, around 56% of
total funds came from foreign sources; by 1975, this had risen to 86%.
Conversely, the share of local deposits went down to 10% in 1975 as against
36% in 1971.
13.       While the capital structure of the banking system (exclusive of
ILBs) grew from US$65 million in 1971 to US206 million in 1975, this has been
mainly due to the fact that some 50 new banks were established during this
period.
14.       Panamanian banks are prohibited by-law from paying interest on
demand deposits. The law also provides that any bank may pay whatever
interest it deems fit on foreign deposits and on local time (savings and
fixed time) deposits. The NBC, howqever, has the power to set interest rates
on savings deposits (defined by regulation as all those time deposits with
a balance of less than US$14,000) in such a way that mortgage banks pay at
least 1% p.a. more than that paid by commercial banks. Currently, mortgage
banks pay 5-1/2% p.a. on such deposits and all other banks, 4-1/2% p.a. With
respect to time deposits, interest paid on them varies and, unfortunately,
no statistics are kept by NBC as to the actual rates paid by individual banks.
Interest rates vary according to the maturity of the time deposit. In the
BNP, for instance, the interest paid on a one-month time deposit is 6-1/2%
p.a. 1/ Reportedly, other banks pay rates which are from 1/4% to 1% higher
than BNP's. The effective cost of these deposits is higher 2/ if account is
taken of the 6% 1/ legal reserve requirement against them. These rates com-
pare farorably with international market rates. The current interest of
BNP for fixed deposits (time deposits over US$14,000) are as follows:
1/   Current as of June 1976.
2/   By about 0.063 of 1%.

(b)  Deposits beyond US$100,000 may earn higher interest rates as
approved by the BNP Board of Directors.
15.       Inter-bank borrowings are of two kinds:  those that are secured from
a foreign source, or those secured from another bank in Panama (a GLB or an
ILB). A "primary" borrower on a direct borrowing pays the international inter-
bank offering rate which can range from something like 5-9/16 p.a. 1/ for an
overnight usance to 7-3/4% for 12 months. 1/ A "secondary" borrower securing
funds from a primary borrower in Panama would pay, depending on its needs for
the moment, anywhere from 1/4% to 3/4% above the international inter-bank
offering rate. Generally, it would be the smaller Panamanian banks which
would pay the higher rates because of their lack of easy access to inter-
national markets.
16.       The rapid rise of Panama as a regional financial center, serving
mostly Latin America, is based on its heavy reliance on foreign deposits and
borrowings. Nevertheless, it must be pointed out that a significant part
of these funds mostly of short-term nature, have been used in the domestic
economy as shown below:
1/   More or less the rates during the second quarter of 1976.

Agricultural Credit
17.       Institutional credit to the agricultural sector comes mainly from
a limited number of private banks, of which the most important are the Chase
Manhattan Bank, Bank of America and the First National City Bank.  The
official banks, principally the Banco Nacional de Panama and the Agricultural
Development Bank (BDA) provide lower levels of overall institutional credit,
but are nevertheless the most important suppliers of long-term development
credit.
18.       Although total institutional credit to the agricultural sector
increased about 3.8 times between 1970 and 1974, its share to total lending
declined from 3.9% to 1.5% during this period. The increased volume in
agricultural lending from about US$36.3 million in 1970 to about US$137.5
million in 1974 is generally the result of increased involvement of the
private banks in short-term financing of cattle purchases for dealing and
fattening operations and in marketing financing of agricultural products
(coffee and sugarcane). Annual volume of agricultural loans granted by
the private banks rose from about US$29.9 million in 1970 to US$114.7
million in 1974 as compared with an increase from US$6.4 million to
US$22.8 million for the public finance institutions. The following
tables gives a summary of credit to agriculture by principal sources and
a comparison with total institutional lending.

below.

In terms of overall 1974 lending to agriculture, crops and livestock have di-
minished in importance with increased emphasis on poultry, fishing and fores-
try as compared with 1970. Out of a total of US$70.3 million lent for live-
stock (excluding poultry) in 1974, only about US$17.2 million or about 24.5%
came from official bank sources. The balance of US$53.1 million from private
banks is probably an inflation of funds used as most private bank loans were
roll-over funds possibly accounted for, twice or three times during the year.
Banco Nacional de Panama (BNP)
19.       Banco Nacional de Panama (BNP), the official state bank, carries
out commercial, mortgage and development banking business as well as exer-
cising certain central bank functions. It was established in 1904 as a
mortgage bank but assumed its present name and scope of operations in an
early reorganization in 1911. It was further reorganized in 1956 under
Law No. 11 and more recently under Law No. 20 of April 22, 1975 when it
became an autonomous state entity, with its own legal personality and in-
dependence regarding the management of its internal affairs. BNP is the
official financial organ of the Government and it is charged, within the
public sector, with obtaining financial resources necessary for the economic
development of the country. The State is responsible for all the obligations
of the Bank. Panama does not have a separate independent central bank, but
BNP is the official depository and trustee for Government and Government-
owned institutions, acts as the banks' clearing house, and performs functions
for the National Treasury. BNP is headquartered in Panama City, and it has
a network of branches and offices throughout the country.
Board of Directors and Management
20.       BNP's Board of Directors consists of five members, all of whom are
appointed by the Government from the private sector. The most recent law
reorganizing BNP requires that this Board, which must meet at least once a
month, be responsible for directing all internal policy matters in line
with the Government's plans and priorities for development of the productive
sectors of the economy.
21.       BNP's General Manager, who is its legal representative, is respon-
sible for the day-to-day management of the bank. Legally, the General Manager,
who is appointed by the President of Panama, should have an academic back-
ground in economics and finance and have been associated in an executive



ANNEX 2
Page 12
position in commerce or industry for a period of at least five of the preced-
ing 10 years. The present incumbent meets these requirements. He is
assisted by a deputy general manager and an Executive Committee composed
of the managers of the bank's seven divisions and the heads of advisory units.
Organization and Staff
22.       BNP has seven divisions with responsibilities as follows:
(a) General Banking: private sector operations involving
industrial, commercial, housing and construction, agri-
cultural, personnel, as well as international and inter-
bank loans and credits.
(b) Government Loans and Finance: credits to the national
and municipal governments and Government-owned enter-
prises.
(c) Development Loans and Finance: working capital and invest-
ment loans to industry, livestock, agriculture and fishing,
including those funded through international finance from
bilateral sources (IDB and USAID) and the special IBRD-
financed projects.
(d) Comptroller General: preparation of budgets and
budgetary control, organization and methods, and
national collections as fiscal agent for the
Government.
(e) General Banking Services: accounting, clearing
house operations for the banking system and bank-
ing operations for and on behalf of the National
Treasury.
(f) Administrative Services: general services, publi-
city and public relations.
(g) Personnel Services: administration, training, and
fringe benefits services for bank staff.
BNP's professional staff consists of 10 qualified accountants, 19 economists,
six agronomists, four veterinarians, seven livestock technicians, 21 lawyers,
41 internal auditors, and one industrial engineer. Its internal staff train-
ing programs are planned on a yearly basis for which there are five instruc-
tors. There was a total of 1,418 employees on September 1, 1976.
23.       BNP's countrywide network of branches and/or offices is supervised
by three regional managers. In line with BNP's shift in emphasis to increased
lending in the areas of agriculture, livestock, fishing, and small and medium



ANNEX 2
Page 13
industry sectors, the number of branch offices in the country's principal
cities had almost doubled by 1975 to reach 62, compared to 34 in 1973. Out-
side of Panama City, where 25 offices are located, most of its expansion into
additional channels for lending has been in the five provinces -- Chiriqui,
Veraguas, Herrera, Los Santos and Cocle -- where most farm/ranch investment
was planned under the First Livestock Development Project. BNP contemplates
opening additional offices to serve its expanding clientele as and when
necessary.
Investment Funds
24.       BNP's investment funds were generated from the following sources
(net year end balances in US$ millions from published accounts):
1973     1974      1975
Paid-in capital                14.0      14.0     14.0

Deposits (sight)              115.6    107.8       90.9
Deposits (term,

foreign deposits)            43.3     90.4    130.9
Overseas banks and

organizations                14.8      13.0     16.9
IMF contingency                14.9      35.1     47.7
25.       The cost of funds are presently:  (a) demand deposits - none; (b)
savings deposits at 4.5% per annum; (c) deposits (foreign) - international
interbank offering rates for the term involved; and (d) foreign borrowings -
at negotiated rates. BNP's condensed statement of source and application
of funds for fiscal year 1975, which is given in Table 7, discloses the
more important financial events of the year 1975.
Lending and Investment Policies and Procedures
26.       Policies.  Except for those set for agriculture and industry 1/
by the National Banking Commission, and for projects financed by AID, IDB,
and IBRD, interst rates are set by the Board of Directors. They are
1/   This refers to the special subsidy to these sectors of loans at 8% p.a.
and 9% p.a. made effective in November 1974.



ANNEX 2
Page 14
reportedly 1% to 2%rr lower than those charged by smaller Panamanian commercial
banks. Current rates (1976) are generally 12% p.a. plus, in most cases, a
service fee of 0.5% for loan balances to US$150,000 and 0.25% for loan
balances above that figure. Likewise, loans to Government pay 1% to 1.5%
above the interbank offering rate at the time of the transaction. Prefer-
ential interest rates in force during 1975 were as follows: 1/
Quarters (%)
1          2           3           4
Agriculture and livestock              10.4         8.0         7.0         7.0 2/
Industry                                9.4         7.0         6.0        8.0
Maturity terms take into account transaction and production cycles in the
case of working capital and marketing loans, and cash flow projections are
basic requirements in the case of long-term development loans.
27.       Collateral may consist of movable or immovable property, or, in
some cases, personal guarantees. The latter, however, are limited to terms
of not more than 18 months. Some examples of maximum loan values of collat-
erals are as follows:
Loan as % of
Collateral                            Market Value
New real estate                                        90
New machinery and equipment                            60
Used machinery and equipment                           50
Fattening cattle                                      100
Breeding animals                                       70
New project shrimp trawlers
(for independent operators)                            95
Other project shrimp trawlers
(limited liability companies, etc.)                    90
Procedures
31.       Loan applications may be filed and processed in any one of BNP's
62 offices. Consultant services were engaged to recommend any implement
the current credit policy and approval procedures which are now in manual
form and currently in use. The authorities and limits are as follows:

Development loan applications generally are evaluated and appraised satis-
factorily, while those for working capital involved considerable paper work,
which could be streamlined. Installments of development loans are disbursed
only after an examination by the responsible officer of the justification
for such disbursements. Specifically in the case of the First Livestock
Loan, 901-PAN, all loans are approved (or rejected) by the Director of the
Technical Unit, specifically established for project execution. Final
approval is the responsibility of the National Credit Committee. Although
lending policies and procedures set up under 901-PAN are satisfactory and
the form of control exercised is acceptable, nevertheless delays arising out
of legal procedures associated with the completion of loan documents are at
times considerable. For future livestock lending, a modified form of the
Credit Committee, called into session at the request of the Project Director
would be preferable.
Lending and Investment Operations
32.       BNP's general pattern of lending for the period 1973-75, expressed
as a percentage of loans approved, is summarized as follows:

33.       Included in this general lending pattern for 1973-75 were BNP's
lending activities in the fishing sector. Its major effort was directed
towards assisting the sub-borrowers of Loan 784-PAN in financing the acqui-
sition of 26 new shrimp trawlers, of which the total cost was US$4,290,000.
34.       Agricultural loans increased from a total of US$3.75 million in
1973 to US$5.69 million in 1975, due mainly to the impact of the interest
subsidy policy which began in November 1974 (and which was expected to end
in late 1976). Loans averaged about US$5,000 in 1973, US$7,700 in 1974,
and US$7,000 in 1975. Consequently, BNP serviced more borrowers in 1975 in
this sector than in either of the two previous years.
35.       Loans to the livestock sub-sector remained at around US$17.3 million
during 1974 and 1975, lower than in 1973 when they totalled US$19 million.
During this period these loans increased from an average of US$6,000 in 1973,
to US$7,300 in 1974, and to US$8,200 in 1975, partially as a result of infla-
tion. At the end of 1973 Loan 901-PAN, for an amount of US$4.7 million be-
came effective. The sub-lending program amounted to only US$3.9 million or
a nominal contribution of about US$1.3 million during each of the three
years for commitment of the loan. These funds have been virtually the only
source of long-term livestock development lending during the period, and
the only true supervised lined of credit.
36.       In general, the lending pattern of BNP is basically that of a com-
mercial bank, and it is in this area that it does approximately 50% of its
total banking business. However, it is beyond question that BNP's develop-
ment finance activities will always be over-shadowed by its commercial banking
activities, despite the growing importance of development banking. For this
reason, the role and organization of various Project Units within BNP should
be strengthened so that they will be able to deal more effectively with the
increasing number of planned development projects.
Results of Operations and Financial Condition
37.       BNP has five main segments of banking activity, but the results of
all operations are published only in consolidated form. Net annual profit,
which in 1971 was about US$950,000 on all operations, had fallen to about
US$590,000 for the year ending 1976, with substantial variations in between.
Loan operating income thus continues to be offset by high admiaiistrative costs.
This situation is acknowledged by BNP and it has introduced a program of
austerity and improved cost control in order to reduce operating costs and
is also concentrating on its most profitable banking activities. Paid-in
capital and reserves have remained virtually without change, rising from
US$17.6 million in 1973 to only US$18.0 million in 1976 (1971 - US$14.0)
Tables 8 and 9 provide further details. Projections to 1980 are in Table 10,
but the capital and reserve structure of BNP is not an issue in itself.
38.       A comparative analysis of the loan portfolio for December 31, 1974,
1975 and 1976 for due and past due accounts shows the following:

39.       The figures for 1976 show an improvement over those of 1975, and
1976, and indicate that as a result of actions taken during 1976, overall
arrears as a percentage of total portfolio at the end of 1976 had been reduced
to 8.3% as compared with 11.6% for 1975 and 1974.
40.       Capital Reserve Account.  The movement in the capital reserve
account is analyzed as follows:

Balance at end of year            2,410    3,983       3,809      3,584
1/  1976 figures are unaudited data supplied by BNP.
2/  Law 11 of 1956 (Art. 40) authorizes BNP to increase its
capital when the capital reserve exceeds US$1,000,000.
By Executive Decree 85 of 1973, the Ministry of Finance
and Treasury authorized an increase in capital of
US$1,500,000. In 1972 US$500,000 was also transferred
to capital under this concept.
The external auditors have reported that BNP had not established the basis for
calculation of its pension reserve and has in the past, annually charged total
amounts paid to its pensioners against the capital reserve. They have recom-
mended that services of an actuary from the Social Security Service be engaged
to advise on the constitution of a pensions reserve, i.e., on the assumption
that periodic pension costs should be provided on an actuarial basis. The
situation has been resolved by legislation enacted in 1975 and 1976, and which
is retroactive to April 1975, under which all aspects of pensions have been
transferred to and assumed by the Department of Social Security. Final
actuarial calculations have, however, yet to be made, but are nevertheless
under study.
41.       Debt/Equity Ratio.  While the 1975 and 1976 gross operating incomes
have shown an increase, they have been absorbed by higher administration
costs in those years. BNP's yearly surpluses have been added to capital re-
serve but the latter's strength has been weakened by charges for pension pay-
ments, provisions for bad debts, and transfers to capital.



ANIIEX 2
Page 19
42.       The bank's equity ratio showed a deterioration from 1971 to
1975, (1971 = 3.93:1, 1975 = 11.59:1), particularly because of public
sector financing, however, at the end of 1976, this ratio had been
reduced to 10.4:1. In addition, it is the intention of BNP to reduce
this ratio to 8:1 by the end of 1978 and to 6:1 by 1980.
Accounting and Auditing
43.       With regard to the 784-PAN and 901-PAN projects, independent audi-
tors of the Comptroller General's office examined the "Statement of Invest-
ments" and the related registers of operations for 1975 and reported that,
in their opinion, such statement of investment and the attached supplementary
financial information satisfactorily showed the financial situation of the
programs partially financed by the Bank in accordance with the loan contracts.
They made recommendations for improving internal accounting controls, which
have been implemented during 1976.
44.       The internal auditing function is carried out by a staff of 41
auditors, responsible directly to BNP's General Manager. Independent audi-
tors from the Comptroller General's office also examined BNP's Consolidated
Statement of Financial Situation and the related Consolidated Income and
Source and Application of Funds Statements as of December 31, 1975. This
examination was carried out in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards and thus included tests of the accounting records and other pro-
cedures considered necessary under the circumstances. In their opinion, the
financial statements present fairly the financial situation of BNP as of
December 31, 1975 and the results of its operations and source and applica-
tion of funds for the year ending on that date are in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis with
those of the previous year. Figures for the year ending 1976 are unaudited
data supplied by BNP.
Agricultural Development Bank (BDA)
45.       The Banco de Desarrollo Agropecuario (BDA), the only state develop-
ment bank in Panama, was established as an autonomous Government Agency, by
Cabinet Decree 1/ in January 1973. BDA, following policy guidelines estab-
lished by MIDA, annually receives national budget support for its domestic
resources and is primarily responsible for project promotion, implementation
and financing of projects for the agricultural sector.
1/   Law No. 13, January 25, 1973.



ANNEX 2
Page 20
Type of Activities
46.       BDA's Decree requires that it direct its lending to (a) small
farmers' associations and cooperatives; (b) small and medium size Farms;
(c) agro-induistrial projects sponsored by MIDA; (d) county and local
governmenit groups (Juntas Comunales), which have agriculture, fishery,
livestock, and agro-industry activities; and (e) any person whose pro-
duction activity is in accordance with MIDA's policy.
Administration
47.       BDA's Board is chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and Livestock
Development ('I)T!') and has four other Board members. The members are the
Minister of Commerce and Industry, the General Manager of BNP, one repre-
sentative of the farmers association and one representative of those farmers
who are not members of associations.
48.       BDA is managed by an Executive Committee composed of its Board
of Directors and the General Manager, who is appointed by the President
of the country. The Committee is responsible for the administration of
PDA, meets regularly and holds active discussions on internal policy matters
and all proposed projects.
Organization and Staff
49.       BDA is organized along functional lines.  Under the General Manager,
the work of BDA is divided into four principal departments, General Adminis-
tration, Planning and Development, Credit, and Finance, each headed by an
Assistant to the General Manager.  It has headquarters in Panama City, with
a countrywide network of regional offices in the six principal cities. Re-
gional offices in turn are organized with functional responsibilities,
allocated along lines similar co those at headquarters and they have agencies
at all major locations.
50.       At December 31, 1975, BDA's executive staff and professional agri-
cultural/livestock technicians numbered 74 and 62, respectively. In the
executive category, 41 members of staff were located at headquarters and 33
at six regional offices. Of the professionals, the allocation was 17 and 45
respectively. Since BDA commenced operations, its professional staff have
regularly attended training programs and the number of professionals and
quasi-professionals working at the field level has now reached 62, three of
whom are working under the auspices of 901-PAN.
Operations
51.       A summary of BDA's operations since its formation is provided in
Table 11. Lending for production in the general agricultural sector, which,
in 1972 was 49% of the amount of total lending, grew to 74% of all lending
activities in 1975. In contrast, its lending for livestock shows a reverse
trend, declining from 51% of total loans in 1972 to 26% in 1975.



ANNEX 2
Page 21
52.       Table 12 provides an analysis Jf BDA's loan operations in 1975 by
size, maturity and interest rates.  The lending pattern clearly indicates
that within the agricultural/livestock sector, PDA finances mainly small,
short-term loans.  About 85% of its lending is on average below US$5,000
equivalent. The majority of loans for crop production (fertilizer, seeds,
etc.) are for periods not exceeding 24 months, with the other major portion
being to the livestock sector (purchase of cattle, pigs, etc.) where loans
are classified as long-term if they exceed 60 months. Interest rates on BDA
subloans are mainly at 8% and 9%. Agricultural loans to small farmers are
subsidized at 8% in accordance with Government policy enacted by Law No. 95
in November 1974. However, this rate is expected to be revised when the law
is allowed to lapse on September 30, 1976. BDA as a participating bank under
901-PAN, on-lends Bank funds at a rate of 10%, and also provides technical
services under the supervision of the Project Director of the TU of BNP.
Loan Portfolio
53.       The table below shows the growth from 1973 to 1975 of BDA's port-
folio, the percentage of past-due loans and indicates the trend in interest
earned from lending.

1974            42.0        1.6              12.3                3.81
1975            51.0        2.3              11.8               4.51
54.       The US$17 million portfolio of lending to the agricultural/livestock
sector which BDA took over from the Instituto de Fomento Economico (IFE), has
increased threefold to US$51 million over the three years BDA has been in
operation. The trend of past-dues has been downward, and at December 31,
1975 BDA's provision for losses represented 3.8% of its portfolio. Generally
a rate of 3% on agricultural loans is considered acceptable, however, in the
light of the size and nature of BDA's portfolio where lending is on a short-
term basis, and potential technical as well as marketing problems exist, BDA
needs to watch its projects closely. Most of BDA's loans which are in arrears
are from the IFE portfolio. The remainder of its portfolio loans are sore
recent, and since they are enjoying a period of grace, it is too early to
make a judgment on their prospects. With regard to BDA's future involvement
in agricultural/livestock credit, the major concern must be to strengthen its
role as a credit institution.



ANNEX 2

Resources and Financial Condition
55.       BDA when formed, commenced FY1973 operations with IFE's assets
and liabilities, represented by a net worth of US$11.0 million. IFE's
credit portfolio, which constituted the major portion of its assets was
US$17.0 million in 1972 and some 80% of IFE's credit to farmers was
supported by TDB loans. At end 1972, TDB had provided US$8.0 million,
fully disbursed, in loans for projects, and a further US$2.0 million
which had been approved was expected to be disbursed shortly. In line
with the Government's intention to promote development in the agricultural
productive sector and its plans to support BDA, the Government assumed
liability for the IDB loans which were then capitalized to BDA. Addi-
tional capital of US$3.0 million was provided through the MIDA Department
of Credit, and BDA's capital as of December 31, 1973 was US$24.0 million.
BDA's balance sheets are shown in Table 13 for the years 1973 to 1975. By
1975 BDA's net worth was US$37.0 million, the growth in capital arising
principally through capitalization of finance provided by the bilateral
sources, IDB and USAID, for which the repayment obligation was undertaken
by Government. According to the Decree which created BDA, its resources
come from interests from lending, Government grants, issue of bonds, loans
from other institutions, and funds raised by MIDA's Marketing Department
(MERCADEO). Since its inception, the bulk of the funds for lending to
agriculture and livestock has come from IDB and USAID. The private banks,
principally Bank of America, have also arranged joint finance to BDA for
short-term credit for fattening operations and market financing of agricul-
tural products. As of December 31, 1975 Government had provided BDA with
US$440,000 equivalent to meet its counterpart contribution for on-lending
under 901-PAN to participating farmers. BDA is dependent on annual budget
support from the Government for its domestic resources. According to the
Minister of Planning and Economic Policy future contribution to BDA are
presently under review.
56.       Income statements for the years 1973 to 1975 (Table 14) show that
BDA has had successive annual losses, due largely to its high personnel and
administrative expenses. Over the three-year period 1973-75 administrative
expenses have averaged 78% of total expenses. BDA needs to examine, and
reduce its high administrative costs. The most recent IDB Loan 404 SF has
provided US$360,000 for technical and consultancy services, US$216,000 of
which is earmarked for a consultant firm 1/ to make a complete management
and operational study of BDA, including its institutional structure. The
consultant's preliminary report is being currently discussed by BDA's
Executive Committee and it is expected that their recommendations will be
implemented early in 1977 and BDA's organizational, administrative and
operational pattern restructured.

Accounts and Auditiing
57.       Monthly financial statements for management reporting are prepared
by BDA's accounting department and RDA is under continuous audit by its own
audit division. As a participating bank under the First Livestock Project,
it is obliged to maintain separate accounts for the lending program. While
BDA's accounting procedures are satisfactory with regard to Project accounts,
the samn cannot be said concerning BDA's management information (accounting)
systemn ill relation to providing data for financial management decisions.
Projected resource requirements and financial results for the next five
years are not prepared on a regular basis, with the result that information
needed for a business judgment of BDA's future prospects are lacking. From
the point of view of ensuring its financial viability BDA's management needs
to be supported in strengthening its role as a development credit institution,
and the present study by independent consultants is expected to institute
appropriate procedures. BDA is audited annually by the Auditor General,
and as is usual for a Government bank, he is acceptable to the Bank as an
independent external auditor.

SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Performance Under Previous Livestock Project
First Livestock Development Project (Loan 901-PAN)
1.        This Project for a total value of US$13.5 million, was financed by
a Bank loan of US$4.7 million and initiated the development of the livestock
sub-sector of Panama by providing long-term loans to farmers and ranchers
in conditions apropriate to viable, supervised investments. In addition to
the financing of about 570 farms (dairying, dual purpose and beef breeding)
the project provided for consultant services for tropical pasture improve-
ment and a feasibility study for livestock development in the Atlantic Coast.
The establishment of a Technical Unit (TU) within the Banco Nacional de Pan-
ama and the training of TU staff was also contemplated. Operations were
country-wide. The project, after initial delays, became effective in
November 1973.
2.        The Republic of Panama guaranteed the Loan and BNP assumed
the exchange risk. Administration was in the hands of BNP which channeled
funds directly to medium-sized sub-borrowers and also used the Agricultural
Development Bank (BDA) as a vector for lending to small individual sub-
borrowers (for subloans under US$12,000) and also to Asentamientos. No
private banks participated, because of the long-term nature of lending and
an unattractive margin. Project execution was through the TU, which was
responsible for the technical and financial appraisal of farm loan requests,
provision of technical assistance and monitoring of the results of sub-
lending.
3.        The objectives of the project, through farm/ranch development
credits and technical assistance, were to assist Panama to raise the level
of beef, milk and breeding cattle production and generate new employment
opportunities in the livestock sub-sector. Targets at full development,
some 10 years (1983) after the initiation of the project, were estimated
to result in the additional annual production of about 8,000 m tong of beef,
7,000 m tons of milk, 8,500 breeding heifers and, 500 breeding bulls to
contribute to higher per capita intake of animal protein foods, greater
exports and import substitution and contribute to the general upgrading of
the national herd. After only three years of project implementation it is,
in 1976 impossible to measure the full impact of the project in objective
terms. However, the TU, under the supervision of the agricultural economist
has (August 1976), set up a system of accounting and data collection on a
representative sample of 16 farms, which will be expanded as farmers become
convinced of the value of maintaining records. Although this aspect of
project execution is simple in concept it is one of the most difficult to
effect in practice.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
4.        The project has achieved positive results from an organizational
and technical standpoint. The greatest achievement accomplished has been the
setting up of the Technical Unit with qualified staff, to implement for the
first time, a system of supervised long-term credit. This has grown from
nothing in 1973 to a staff in 1976 comprising a Director, three specialists
(in agricultural economics, dairy production and tropical pastures), and
supported by 14 regionally distributed field technicians and appropriate
administrative staff and logistic facilities. When the results of monitoring
are analyzed, it will be found that on the forms of beneficiaries, the
technical parameters of carrying capacity, milk production per cow, calving
rates and weights for age have all improved, in spite of the general static
or declining position of the national herd. The income levels and diversifi-
cation of nutrition and incomes on the Asentamientos will also be shown to be
significant.
5.        The original loan components, subsequent reallocation on August 17,
1976 and state of commitment and disbursement at December 31, 1976 are shown
below:
Original    Current

1I. Technical Services   425,000       638,000     472,308    450,493

Total       4,700,000   4,700,000   4,146,701  2,751,511
The loan is thus about 90% committed and of the funds committed, 66% was dis-
bursed as of December 31, 1976. The attention of BNP has been drawn to this
situation for an appropriate acceleration of disbursement procedures. In addi-
tion to the Bank funds for the 306 farms subloans already committed, another
14 subloans valued at US$405,000 were in the process of study and legal-
ization by BNP and BDA and 13 more valued at about US$360,000 were being
analyzed by the field technicians. These together represent about US$765,000
(about US$350,000 of Bank funds). In effect the loan is totally committed.
Provided disbursement can be speeded up, it is expected that there will
be no request to extend Closing Date beyond December 31, 1978.
6.        The actual lending performance (A) of December 31, 1976 as compared
with appraisal estimates (E) is shown below:

The change in lending emphasis from beef to dairying has been due to the
relative shift between 1973 and 1976 in dairy/beef prices. In this period
there has been a fall off in the beef market and an improvement in milk
prices. Current lending is mainly to small dairy and dual purpose farms.
The average loan size per beneficiary is apparently high in comparison with
appraisal estimates, but bearing in mind that the Asentamientos contain abol;
135 families, the average subloan per family granted under the project
approximates to about US$15,000 which compares well with appraisal estimates
of US$16,500.
7.        Distribution of expenditure by type of investment is broadly in
line with appraisal estimates as follows:
Investment                 Actual         Appraisal Estimate
Pasture development               17                  23
Fencing                           10                   8
Water facilities                   3                   2

Stock handling facilities          2                   6
Machinery and equipment            7                   5

Miscellaneous                      -                   7
Total           100                 100
The increase in investments in buildings over appraisal estimates reflects
the increased investment in dairy facilities to attempt to comply with Grad:
A milk standards of licensing.
8.        With the initiation of the Atlantic Coast Feasibility Study and t
audited project accounts from BDA, the borrower (BNP) is now in compliance
with the requirements of the Loan Agreement. The current activities of the
Project Technical Unit, its staffing, and the facilities it has for ope-
rational purposes are satisfactory.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
9.        Principal repayments from sub-borrowers are not yet due because of
grace period provisions. Interest payments received in 1976 have fallen
behind by about 22% of those due owing to severe drought conditions which have
reduced farm sales of milk. Another concern is with the public health
standards laid down for the production of Grade A milk and the resulting
high on-farm investment costs to achieve such standards in Panama. To over-
come a repetition of high building costs to achieve Grade A milk standards,
Government requested a review of milk and building standards and pricing
policies. Although it was initially proposed that this study should be
financed from the proceeds of Category III of the loan it was subsequently
financed and carried out by USAID and a report was prepared in early September
1976 for consideration by Government. If accepted in its present form, the
implementation of the findings of the report could lead to reduced investments
in farm buildings, better methods of Grade A producer classification, better
on-farm and at-plant control of quality and improved prices to producers
without necessarily increasing prices to consumers.
10.       The consultants, recently appointed under the project are perform-
ing satisfactorily after a long delay securing the appropriate contracts.
The specialist in tropical pastures, appointed for a two-year term has,
during his first year of work established good working relationships with
project staff, participating farmers and technicians of MIDA. He is in the
process of developing centers for seed and vegetative material multiplica-
tion and he is also active in giving on-farm advice in pasture establishment
and in forage conservation. He has prepared a diagnosis of pasture problems
and solutions which is in current use as a field manual. The first phase
of the feasibility study of the Atlantic Coast for livestock development has
been completed by ADEASA, a Panamanian consulting firm with Bank approved
terms of reference. After the reconnaissance survey was studied by Govern-
ment, priority for the second phase detailed study concentrated on Zone 4
(IBRD Map No. 10159R) in Colon Province. This study has now been completed
and will be fowarded to the Bank after a review by Government.
Performance of Participating Banks
11.       Out of the 306 subloans in operation at November 30, 1976, 220
were made by BNP and 86 by BDA for values of US$6,712,652 and US$975,190
respectively. As BDA is restricted only to small loans below US$12,000 and
to lending to asentamientos, its role has been severely restricted. This was
deemed necessary because of the lack of BDA funds for counterpart long- and
short-term financing of borrowers. To overcome this difficulty the Govern-
ment provided US$1,000,000 to enable BDA to participate. An additional con-
straint on BDA financing to Asentamientos was the failure of MIDA to provide
technical management of the Asentamientos as required in the Loan Agreement,
except to the four currently being financed. During the execution of 901-
PAN, BDA has indicated that it has no great interest in continuing as a par-
ticipating bank unless it can compete on an equal footing with BNP and with
a more attractive margin. Government considers that BDA has a sufficiently



ANNEX 3
Page 5
strenuous task to execute IDB and USAID funded projects and other specific
Government programs, without being further involved in long-term livestock
lending.
Problems in Project Execution
12.       As in all first phase projects, 901-PAN suffered initial delays
due to legislative, staffing and administrative requirements. These matters
required a postponement of Effective Date to November 1973, but even after
effectiveness, the project was slowed down because of the need for training
technicians and finding suitably qualified candidates for specialist posi-
tions. Because of lack of administrative experience, there were problems
in disbursement procedures and in internal organization. Even while sub-
lending commenced, some difficulties in technical staff recruitment and the
provision of vehicles and adequate office facilities persisted, which were
finally resolved after a series of supervision missions. It was not until
1975 that the Borrower was in full compliance with the Loan Agreement, with
the contracting of a tropical pastures consultant and with a firm of consul-
tants to undertake the Atlantic Coast study.
13.       Current problems are the lack of frequency of meetings of the
Credit Committee for subloan approval and a slowness to disburse to farmers.
Other administrative aspects such as salary levels, the autonomy of the
Project Director in his day to day activities, and a clear command link
between the project and BNP need to be clarified internally. In spite of
such problems, the execution of the project is considered to be satisfac-
tory and will continue to be so with maintenance of a well qualified and
motivated Technical Unit, actively supported by the management of BNP.

SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Livestock Models
1.        Three livestock production systems were selected as being represen-
tative of those in which further investment could be considered profitable at
the farm level, and which are consistent with country objectives. These are:
(a) dual purpose, beef/dairy production in all parts of the
country;
(b) specialized milk production, mainly in the high altitude
humid zone; and
(c) a specialized heifer rearing and milk production unit (PRODEIRHA)
in the dry area of Rio Hato, Cocle Province.
2.        In constructing the models, attention has been paid to the general
level of management that presently exists in the livestock industries, and
production parameters fixed accordingly (Tables I to 3). Account was also
taken, of the strong and close technical ties between the lending authority
(Banco Nacional de Panama) through its Technical Unit, and the client. In
the First Livestock Development Project most clients have exceeded goals set
by the technical advisers even though many projects have completed less than
two years of programmed development. It is also envisaged that most poten-
tial sub-borrowers will be farmers who are better than average managers and
capable of responding to technical advise. Considering these factors, it is
believed that the physical parameters used are conservative, and would
readily be achieved. The cost and income details used in the models are
based on data gathered by the Technical Unit of the First Livestock Project
during its first two and a half years of operation.
(a) Dual Purpose Farms (Tables 4 to 7)
3.        This model is representative of dual-purpose farm activities in
the foothills of the mountains throughout Panama. Rainfall is seasonal,
with dry period lasting from two and five months. This type of production
system has increased substantially during the past five years despite con-
straints such as poor access roads.  Most farms are still partly timbered.
Farms tend to be understocked, and the average level of management is gen-
erally low, with low productivity per animal. There are few structural
improvements. Development of the typical farm of 50 ha, would require the
clearing of timbered areas of the farm except for steep slopes where it is
necessary to retain protective covering against erosion. Pasture establish-
ment of species such as (B. decumbens, P. maximum), and small areas of a



ANNEX 4
Page 2
fodder grass (S. sinensis) for conservation would be financed. Carrying
capacities can be increased from 0.8 AU per ha to about 2 per ha. Seasonal
feed gaps would be filled with fodders conserved in the form of silage, using
a simple mechanical chopper, or as green feed where supplementary watering is
available.
4.        Structural improvements would include the construction of sub-
divisional fences, basic milking sheds, silos and the provision of water.
5.        Subloans would finance the purchase of improved milking strains
of crossbred, in-calf females and purebred dairy type bulls with the objec-
tive of diluting the proportion of Zebu blood in the herd to less than 25%,
and also to build up herd numbers, to take advantage of the additional feed
available. Infertile cows would be rigidly culled.
6.        In addition to the capital investment program, improved farm tech-
nology would be introduced by the technical advisers, which would aim at the
reduction of the mating period (to avoid calving during the very wet months of
October and November), provision of a mineral and energy supplement, a planned
animal health program against internal and external parasites, and a basic
pasture and forage management program. As at present, cows would be milked
once a day and bull calves would be sold at 12 months of age. In most areas
it would be feasible to milk all year round.
7.        As a result of the average farm investment of US$26,200, coupled
with technical assistance, herd productivity would increase.  There is no
reason why calving should not rise from 50% to 80%. The daily milk yield
per cow should improve from about 3.3 to 5.0 liters, and the lactation
period extended from 180 to 230 days per year.  The financial rate of return
is estimated to be 14%.
(b) Specialized Dairy Farms (Tables 8 to 11)
8.        The activity represented by this model is seen as a development,
or transition, of dual purpose production units to specialized, Grade A milk
production. The farms financed would be above average in their current levels
of management and the quality of their herds. To meet public health hygiene
standards, considerable capital investment in dairy buildings and water sup-
plies would be required. Similarly, investment in the desired dairy cows
would initially be high due to their limited availability. Until now nearly
all specialized milk animals have been imported, mostly from the United
States. The shortage of suitable climatically adapted animals, although
an initial constraint would be overcome by the Government policy of creating
strategic breeding and importing centers and the activities of PRODEIRHA
(see below). The most appropriate region for milk production is in the
province of Chiriqui, however, given the availability of a suitable cross-
bred milking type animal, this activity could also be promoted in the drier
and hotter, central provinces. While the model has been constructed on the
basis of the present high investment requirements, it should be noted that
if public health regulations were to be made less restrictive, specialized
milk production could be promoted with a lesser degree of capital investment.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
9.        The beneficiaries' farm of about 50 ha is envisaged as a partly
developed dual purpose production unit, operated at above-average manage-
ment level. Investment would require to improve the pastures by planting
about 8 ha with African Star Grass, Tanner and Indiana, and renovating the
remainder. Further sub-division and the renovation of existing fences is
required, together with improvements to the water supply, by drilling and
equipping wells. The construction or upgrading of milking sheds and instal-
lation of milking and milk treatment equipment is required, together with
the upgrading of the access road from the shed to the farm gate where nec-
essary. The provision of a farm vehicle could be financed on a small per-
centage of cases, as well as a forage chopper for making silage. Artificial
insemination equipment and semen could be provided if cows are to be bred by
this means.
10.       Substantial investment in breeding cows is planned, so that the
lowest producing cows in the existing herd may be culled. Cows would be
milked twice a day and the change-over to specialized milk production could be
made in the second year of the program. At this point the male calves would
be sold at one week old, and only selected female calves retained for breed-
ing. All heifers not in-calf would be culled, so that the only cows in the
herd would be of proven fertility.
11.       It is estimated that milk production would be lifted from 5.5
liters per cows to 8.0 liters per day, the lactation period extended from
210 to 305 days, and calving percentage raised from 70 to 80%.
12.       An investment of US$46,300 per 50 ha farm would be required.  The
financial rate of return is estimated to be 18.5%.
(c) PRODEIRHA (Tables 12 to 16)
13.       One important new aspect of the Second Livestock Project is to
include livestock development financing to complement the agricultural activi-
ties of an existing Government farm in the Province of Cocle, currently being
partially developed by Government budgetary allocations. This component is
described by Government as the project for the integrated development of Rio
Hato (PRODEIRHA). The livestock farm is situated on a military base which
already serves as an agricultural production center, and where a school for
teaching agriculture and livestock production to campesino leaders now exists.
The staff gives technical advice and services to about 11 local asentamientos.
Its current agricultural production now provides employment to about 450 local
people on a seasonal basis. The technical staff of PRODEIRHA is strong and is
fully qualified in livestock and agricultural production, farm development and
mechanization. PRODEIRHA is also supported by an Israeli technical team and a
Chinese (Taiwan) team of irrigation experts. PRODEIRHA receives assistance
from the Ministry of Agriculture (MIDA) and the livestock component will be
supervised by the technical staff of the TU of the BDP.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
14.       PRODEIRHA is a completely new operation insofar as its livestock
activities are concerned. The base itself comprises a first class airfield
under the Department of Civil Aviation, and in addition a minimum of 5,000
ha of land of which about 500 is suitable for intensive cropping, about
1,000 ha for occasional cropping or improved pasture and from 1,000 to
2,000 ha is suitable for pasture. Government has title to all of the land of
the base, but because of its training importance, the land will not be granted
to asentamientos or cooperatives. On the other hand, the Government, with
its renewed emphasis on agricultural production, wishes to put this land to
the best possible use. About two years ago, the Government decided to inten-
sify and formalize the system of production, and through the Ministry of
Agriculture (MIDA), established a cropping pattern for irrigated production of
high value, labor intensive field crops and market garden activities. An
irrigation system has been developed to command about 250 ha for the produc-
tion of okra for export and tomatoes, onions, cabbage and lettuce for sale in
Panama City. The sale of okra is by a long-term contract with a Miami based
company which has also sent its own expert to Rio Hato to advise on produc-
tion, quality control and packaging. Using the airstrip at Rio Hato, okra can
be in the Miami markets in a matter of hours after harvesting. In addition to
its cropping activities PRODEIRHA has constructed a grain storage system for
conditioning and marketing its own grain production and the center also buys
grains produced on local Asentamientos at a generally higher price than is
usually paid by middleman.
15.       In line with its policy to become self sufficient in milk production,
the Government intends to set up a series of state operated breeding centers
in representative ecological zones, based initially on the importation of
suitable milking strain heifers for adaptation to local conditions, breeding
with high quality bulls and subsequent re-sale to individual or group farmers,
preferable to those who have access to credit and technical assistance. The
livestock component of PRODEIRHA as submitted in the Second Livestock Project
report is thus in line with overall Government policy and part of PRODEIRHA
planning.
Legal Form
16.       PRODEIRHA is still without legal institutional form.  Government is
still working on the legal drafting and the draft is expected to be reviewed
with the Bank and enacted before Loan effectiveness. In the meantime PRODEIRHA's
agricultural development program has been financed by direct budget allocation
and short-term loans from the BNP with Government guarantees.
Management Type
17.       Management is by Committee consisting of the heads of the depart-
ments shown overleaf, chaired by a President representing the Government. His
function is of an administrative and coordination nature rather than technical.
Functionally, management of PRODEIRHA's production activities is in the hands
of technically qualified professionals as shown below:

Each department or area of activities is functionally separate, with its own
departmental head and field staff.  Accounts for each activity are kept
separate and each is expected to be self supporting.  Such services as are
supplied by one department to another are sold, including the overhead costs
of the accounting department. By virtue of his training, the President has
managerial and administrative experience. This also applies to the depart-
mental heads. The agricultural department is headed by a professional agri-
culturalist on permanent transfer from MIDA. He is a civilian with wide
experience in irrigated crop production. The livestock department has a
professionally qualified livestock production expert (zootechnician) with
sound production experience within and outside Panama. It is proposed that
the existing technical manager be in charge of the Bank financed sub-project.
The machinery department undetakes development works (dams, roads, canals,
brush cleaning etc.) both within the base of Rio Hato and in the surrounding
asentamientos. Its head is a qualified civil engineer with management and
organizational experience. The agro-industries department is run by a
civilian agronomist on transfer from MIDA and he has experience of similar
operations in the private sector. Plans are being prepared to expand the
grain purchasing, storage and marketing activities into the production of
livestock feeds. The packaging of vegetables and okra and their marketing
also comes under this department. The accounting department is headed by a
professional accountant and the teaching operations are carried out by all
staff with the technical support mentioned above. All of the departments are
supported by experienced foremen and other civilian field staff, while labor
is provided by agricultural workers from the area, including people from local
asentamientos. PRODEIRHA is soundly staffed and run by well disciplined
professionals who are development oriented.
Accounts, Budget, Sources of Funds
18.       As the livestock component for PRODEIRHA, as proposed in the Second
Livestock Project will be a new operation, there are no accounts. It is, how-
ever, planned to be a self supporting and independently financed operation,
with separate profit and loss accounts and balance sheets. Each department
head is responsible for preparing and submitting his annual capital develop-
ment and operating budget for the approval of the Committee. This is verified



ANNEX 4
Page 6
by the Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy and funds are made available
both from budget allocation and from loans made through the BNP. The live-
stock department has made a budgetary submission which serves as the basis for
the proposed subproject (Annex 4, Tables 12-16). Both the investment budget
and operating cost proposals have been approved by Government (Ministry of
Planning) and there is a budgetary provision of US$1 million as equity to help
finance the livestock component if a subloan through the Second Project is
approved BNP is also prepared to provide short-term working capital to cover
operating costs or deficits until the break-even point is reached. Application
of funds will be strictly according to the final farm development plan to be
submitted to BNP and approved by the Bank. Advances will be made only with the
approval of the Project Director, following satisfactory inspections of the
previous application of funds. This project would be subject to specific
monitoring of technical and financial results and these conditions would form
part of the subloan agreement.
PRODEIRHA Responsibilities and Links with Other Agencies
19.       PRODEIRHA is intended to be operated on a profitable basis, but the
Government is prepared to support the training and demonstration activities.
It has links with and is supported by the Ministries of Agriculture and of
Planning, the BNP, the military and the Technical Unit of the Livestock
Project. It is also receiving bilateral support for Israel and China (Taiwan)
and has export contracts and technical support from a USA based importing
company. Although the Government provides technical support and some budgetary
assistance, management is in the hands of the committee of PRODEIRHA and there
is no bureaucratic interference beyond overall approval of operating policy.
20.       Under this proposed subproject, at an estimated cost of about
US$1.7 million, 1,000 ha of improved pastures and infrastructure would be
developed for the purposes of specialized milk production and the importation
and subsequent breeding of improved milking strain cows for sale to farmers
preferably, but not exclusively to Project beneficiaries. Because of the
shortage of milk, and locally adapted milking strains of cows, it is Govern-
ment policy to establish a network of centers such as PRODEIRHA throughout
appropriate areas of Panama.  Because of its future   impact in the province
and because of its technical soundness, the mission views this subproject with
favor and recommends its inclusion in the Project.
21.       The livestock subproject of PRODEIRHA starts virtually from scratch
and would require an investment of about US$1 million in pasture development
and in basic infrastructure and machinery and equipment. Initial purchase of
imported, adaptable breeding cattle over the three years of development, would
be of the order of US$500,000. This importation would generate a cash flow
to allow PRODEIRHA to continue the process of importation and to provide
improved livestock to Project beneficiaries and other producers. This kind of
State action will assist the private sector to meet its objectives of national
self sufficiency in milk.



ANNEX 4
Page 7
22.       About US$200,000 would be invested in the dev7elopment of 1,000 ha
of pastures and appropriate subdivision with fences. Because of the un-
developed nature of the farm, current land use for grazing is minimal, but the
carrying capacity is estimated to be about 0.5 AU per ha. With sown pastures,
contouring, water development and conservation, the carrying capacity is
estimated to be about 2 AU per ha.
23.       With the technical, managerial and administrative strength of
PRODEIRHA, its support from MIDA and the constant supervision of the TU cf
BNP, the sub-project can readily achieve carrying capacities of 2 AU per "a;
calving rates of 85% and milk production of about 10 liters per cow/day.
24.       The ultimate output from PRODEIRHA would be about 1,400 in-calf-
heifers per year and about 250 culled cows and bulls. Milk production would
be absorbed by PRODEIRHA itself or sold to the surrounding population.
25.       The estimated financial rate of return is about 13.5%.

Plowing and harrowing (hired machinery)               US$    20.00/ha
B. Operating Cost Assumptions
Labor
Labor cost per man year including 29%
of social security payments and other
benefits    -  unskilled rural labor             US$ 1,440/man year
-  semi-skilled rural labor         US$ 2,160/man year
Total labor per model
Model 1.       -  Pre-development year.  One man-
year for each 25 cows in
milk. Years 1-20, one man-year
for each 20 cows in milk.
Model 2        -  Pre-development and year 1,
1/2 man year around plus
1 man for each 15 cows in
milk. Years 2-20, 1 man year
around (semi-skilled) plus
1 man for each 30 cows in
milk.

ANNEX 9
PANAMA
SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
1.        Rates of return have been calculated on the basis of models and
tables as shown in Annexes 4 and 5, both separately for each model and for
the project as a whole. Key assumptions and adjustments were as follows:
(a) Investment and operating costs were calculated using June
1976 prices and they represent costs at the farm level.
Relative costs and prices were assumed to remain unchanged;
i.e., any changes in the rate of inflation would be self-
compensating.
(b) Output prices utilized were farmgate prices and, except for
beef, were assumed to remain unchanged throughout the life
of the project. Incremental production of milk and breeding
animals would supply the domestic market. Incremental beef
production, a by-product of the dairies, was assumed to release
similar amounts of better quality beef for the export market:
(i) The project's milk output would replace milk imports and
produce savings in foreign exchange; in spite of the
above, however, a combination of domestic and inter-
national prices was used. The current domestic price
of US$0.23 per liter was applied for fluid Grade A milk.
Trade in this type of milk is insignificant in the world
market and no comparable price in dry powder equivalent
could be estimated on account of the difficulties involved
in adjusting international prices to subsidies in the
world market. For industrial milk, which is closely
identified with imported milk, a price of US$0.18 per
liter was utilized. This price corresponds to the average
price paid by Panama (in fluid milk equivalent at the farm
level) for skim powder milk and butter-oil imported from
New Zealand. The resultant price (US$0.18) is US$0.015
per liter above the current domestic price and equal to
the price to be paid during the dry season.
(ii) For beef, CIF prices converted to FOB and farmgate or
firstpoint of sale were utilized. Since the US and
Puerto Rico are the main outlets for Panama's beef
export, prices reflect the US market. In determining
future prices, the Bank's EADP projection was utilized,
therefore assuming that world prices would prevail in



ANNEX 9
Page 2
future price trends. The resultant price for the base
year of the analysis (1976) was US$500 per metric ton
liveweight, a little below (US$20) the price utilized
in the financial analysis.
(iii) For breeding cattle, the average current domestic price
was utilized. Panama's prices for breeding cattle are
above the domestic prices in other countries such as
the US or the rest of Central America. However, they are
a reflection of the difficulties associated with importing
of live animals and the high cost of acclimatizing them to
local conditions.
(c) A shadow wage rate of 0.8 times the nominal unskilled rural wage
was utilized as the best estimate to compensate for rural under-
employment (Annex 1). The financial wages paid to semiskilled
and skilled labor were taken to be equal to the shadow wage rate.
(d) The shadow rate of exchange was considered to be equal to the
nominal exchange rate (US$1 = Balboa 1) 1/. This assumption is
justified by the Government's general fiscal and foreign trade
policy, characterized by a low overall effective tariff and the
absence of export controls, subsidies, and taxes. Currency is
freely convertible, and there is a large and constant flow of
funds in and out of the country.
(e) Since taxes, tariffs and social benefit payments to labor are
transfer payments within the economy, benefits and costs were
adjusted to compensate for them.
(f) A project life of 20 years was utilized in the analysis of all
project components. Incremental herd values were credited to
the benefit stream at the end of the project life.
(g) The administrative and technical costs related to the operation
of the Project Unit were charged to the total project costs from
year 6 to 20, since it was assumed that such assistance would
have to be continued on a regular basis after the initial five-
year investment period.
2.        Based on these assumptions, the project's economic rate of return and
sensitivity analysis for each model and for the total project are as follows:
1/   Panama does not have Balboa bills, only coins.  The bills of all denomi-
nation are the US dollars, although, for practical purposes, called
Balboas.
