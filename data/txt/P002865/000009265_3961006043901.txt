TOGO URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:    Government of Togo
Beneficiaries: The Population of Lom6
Executing
Agendes:    STCC and AGETUR
Credit
Amount:      US$26.2 million equivalent
Terms:       Standard IDA termis, with 40 years' maturity
Project
Desciption:  The project's immediate objectives are to help the Government implement its emerging
urban development policy through: (a) the execution of priority urban works having
optimal impact on the employment and incomes of the poor; (b) the promnotion of small
contractors in the construction sector; and (c) the active participation ef local residents,
community groups, and NGOs in neighborhood environmental improvement activities.
The longe-r-term objectives are to: (a) strengthen the ability of local Government to
administer the city with better defined lines of authority, responsibility and sources of
.rvenue; (b) lay the groundwork for innovations needed to reform the management of
urban developmen. in Togo; (c) bring about progressive and permanent improvement in
urban enviromnental management; and (d) contribute to urban poverty alleviation.
The following project components would support these objectives:
(a)    a city-wide program to improve transport and traffic conditio:is, consisting of
labor-based works designed to be executed by small contractors (US$12.7
million, 43.7% of base costs);
(b)   a programn to improve environmental and sanitary conditions of the Be lagoon and
its surrounding neighborhoods (erosion control and dredging of.the lagoon,
drainage works, US$7.04 million, 25% of base costs);
(c)    a program to support conmnunity development and the execution of community
works in the Be area (US$3.77 million, 14% of base costs); and
(d)   a program to promote institution and capacity building in the area of urban
management (US$4.75 million, 17% of base costs).
Environental
Impact:      Concem for improving environmental and sanitary conditions is a major project
objective and therefore influences the design of all companents.  The proposed
design was reviewed during appraisal and found to be environmentally sound. The
project will make a .positive overall contribution to envirenmental quality; any
potentially negative consequences will be addressed in the project's detailed
engineering.

- I -
Benefits:    Road, drainage and sanitation works to be caried out under the project are part of a
larger program of priority infrastructure rehabilitation. It is estimated that more than
180,000 residents would benefit from reductions in exposure to waterborne diseases.
Local government capacity building would furthermore improve the management of urban
growth. The project's impact on the local economy in general, and on the construction
industry, in particular, is expected to be immediate; at least 1.1 million work-days of
mostly unskilled jobs (90%) -will be created.
Risks:       The main risk associated with project implementation is largely outside the project's
control, and concerns the relative political instability of the country, the difficult
economic situation aftei two years of political turmoil, and the recent decision to devalue
the CFA franc by 50%. During post-appraisal, the Govermment clearly expressed its
commitment to the project's objectives, emphasizing its impact on the urban poor. Other
implementation risks concern the ability of the newly-created AGETUR to execute the
project and of STCC to supervise it. These risks would be mininized by the provision
of technical assistance on a short-teim basis, as well as administrative and accounting
support, and also by restricting project execution within their absorptive capacity.
AGETUR should be sustainable beyond the project implementation period. As municipal
finances improve and community participation develops with support provided by the
project, local resources to continue these programs sould increase. Also, experience
with similar agencies in neighboring countries has shown that strong confidence in their
efficiency has led to increased external funding of their operations.
Economic Rate
of Retum:   Over 18% (urban roads rehabilitation)
Poverty
Category:    The project's impact on the local economy in general, and on the constmction industry
in particular, is expected to be immediate: at least 40% of project financing would flow
directly into the local economy in the form of civil works that local SMEs can carry out.
Assuming that at least 30% of local contracts would be spent on salaries and wages for
unskilled labor by private SMEs in the construction sector, more than US$4.5 M would
benefit the poorest urban workers. This would create 1.1 million work-days of mostly
(90%) unskilled jobs. Environmental sanitation improvements resulting from drainage
works and maintenance to be carried out under the project would benefit about
180,000 urban residents, mostly urban poor. Other community-based improvements
carried out in the Be area would benefit residents of that area for a total of
30,000 beneficiaries, also urban poor.
Estimated Project Completion: June 30, 1999.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TIHE PRESIDENT
OF TIHE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AssocIuON
. TO TIE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THIE REPUBLIC OF lOGO
rOR A
TOGO URBAN DEVELOPNT PROWECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and reconunendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Togo for SDR 18.6 million (US$26.2 million equivalent). The
proposed credit would be granted on standard IDA terms with 40 years' maturity. It would help finance
a Lom6 Urban Development Project, with the govemment contributing US$2.4 niillion and beneficiaries
US$0.4 million to project financing.
2.    Country Background. Togo's economy depends primarily on cotton, coffee, cocoa production;
phosphate mining; and regional trade. During the 1980s, Togo undertook a wide-ranging economic
adjustment supported by IDA through the first (1983) and second (1985) Adjustment Credits, which was
successful in reversing the negative trend in growth.
3.    In 1986-87, however, world prices for phosphate and cotton dropped and Togo experienced a
sharp downtun in its terms of trade, which exacerbated problems caused by heavy external debt-service
payments and a surge of extrabudgetary government spending. Reforms in 1988 and 1989-sponsored
by a Third Structural Adjustment Credit, debt relief from Paris and London Club creditors, and assistance
from nlti-and bilateral donors-brought Togo's real growth to five percent a year.
4.    In late 1990, Togo's government sought World Bank support again, but implemnntation of SAC
IV was hampered by sociopolitical disturbances in the country. As the political crisis intesified, the
economic and financial position weakened considerably, culminatng in November 1992 with a general
strike that lasted eight months. GDP declined by about 9 percent in 1992 and 13 percent in 1993, and
important internal and external payments were in arrears.
5.    The Togolese population was hard hit by the strike. Per capita consumption dropped by about
12 percent in 1992, and by 20 percent in 1993. It now appears, however, that order is restored.
Presidential elections were held in August 1993 and legislative elections in February 1994.
6.    In February 1994, the West Africa Monetary Union (WAMU) realigned their currency. To help
address the economic and social issues inherited from the sociopolitical crisis, the IDA-financed portfolio
of projects was restructured. Projects under preparation are to address the people's emergency needs-in
particular, the need for employment generation.
7.    Sector background. Lome, Togo's capital, now has some 700,000 inhabitants in an area of
9,000 hectares. Over the past decade, its population has risen at the rate of 5.5 percent per year. Lome's
urban management capacity, however, is poor. Its physical infrastructure is insufficiernt to support these
numbers.
8.    Lome's roads are still largely unpaved and infrastructure is deteriorating rapidly for lack of
maintenance. Drains are insufficient, toilet facilities lacking, and the water table is dangerously high. In
much of the city, sanitary conditions pose serious health hazards. Conditions in Be-Lom6's oldest
district, inhabited by an estimated 180,000 people-are particularly worrisome. Yet Bt's inhabitiants
have maintained community solidarity. The Be Development Committee (CDB) is an active federation
of community-based organizations.
9.    In the early 1980s, municipal government was made responsible for msnaging most of the Lome
urbanized area (although not the burgeoni.g city outskirts). It was not, howvever, given the abilit to



ii                                                       Togo Urban Development Project
mobilize an appropriate resource base. As it now stands, Lom6 municipality is too poorly staffed and
organized to take over service management from the central administration.
10.   Objectives. The project's immediate objective is to mitigate the effects of the CFA devaluation
and of the political turmoil which has affected the country for the past 18 months through: (a) the
execution of priority urban works whose optimal impact on unemployment will be the intensive use of
unskilled labor providing employment and incomes for the poor and improvement of traffic conditions;
(b) the promotion of small enterprise in the construction sector; and (c) the active participation of local
residents, grass roots groups, and NGOs in activities to improve the neighborhood enviromnent. The
project's will seek to achieve longer-term objectives: (a) strengthening the ability of local government
to manage urban growth through a studies component; (b) pemianently improving urban enviromnental
management, especially the water cycle and household waste; (c) helping to prepare reforms in local
resource mobilization to strengthen the cited role in national development; and (d) alleviating urban
poverty.
11.   Description. As proposed, the project will include the following components:
*     Transport and traffic. A city-wide program of labor-based works implemented by small
contractors (US$12.7 million, 43.7 percent of base costs)
*     rUrbar enironmentandsaniaion. Erosion contr,, dreJg g, and drainage works in BF
lagoon and its surrounding neighborhc.-. (US$7.ZtI .r I'ion, 25 percent of base costs)
*     Community development. Implementation of small-scale community projects devised by
the people of Be (US$3.77 million, 14 percent of base costs)
*     Institution and capacity-building. Training in urban management (US$4.75 million, 17
percent of base costs).
It is estimated that the global cost of works is CFAF 6 billion (about US$12 million), or about US$2.5
million a year (for a complete financial break-down, see Schedule A).
12.   Implementaton. Under this project, labor-intensive urban works will be carried out by local
SMEs, with the contract awards, works supervision, and payment handled by AGETUR. Overall project
coordination will be the responsibility cf a steering committee (the CCGU) that includes the Mayor of
Lome and representatives from the Planning, Interior, Finance, and Equipment ministries and the Be
Development Committee. The technical secretariat of the CCGU, the STCC, will handle day-to-day
project management; coordinate support studies; and manage the project's social, economic, financial,
urban planning, and technical interventions.
13.   The Ministry of Equipment will identify the primary infrastructure interventions, the City of
Lome improvements needed in secondary infrastructure, and the Be Development Committee tertiary
infrastructure and neighborhood improvement activities. Once CCGU has approved these programs, they
will be submitted to IDA for verification that they conform with the project's goals and description and
then to AGETUR for implementation.
14.   CCGU will delegate subproject identification, design, justification, and programming to STCC
and project works implementation to AGETUR. STCC will be responsible for hiring consultants for
feasibility studies, technical assistance, training and supervision. AGETUR will be responsible for
contracting civil works, related engineering studies, and for works supervision. Each will have a Special
Account for the payment of invoices received from SMEs and local consultants. Financial stemens wil
be submitted to IDA along with selected work programs for review.

15.   Sustainablity. The project includes a capacity-building component to help local government
increase its ability to mobilize revenues that can be used for urban services and infrastructure
maintenance. With AGETUR doing the contracting and disbursement, fiurthermore, policy and planning
will be sepalate from day-to-day execution. (In Senegal and other West African countries, agencies
resembling AGETUR have proved effective over the long tezm.)
16.   Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement. IDA experience suggest that, to change national
policy, a sector-wide program is required. Togo's government has therefore asked for an urban
institution-building component to help define a comprehensive approach to urban policy and sector
development, particularly with regard to the decentralization of responsibility for urban services and
revenue gathering.
17.   Reasons for IDA Involvement. The proposed project complements Bank and goverunent efforts
for overall economic, social, and financial recovery in Togo. It will support communuity-based initiatives,
promote the development of private sector activities, and-perhaps most importantly-create many
unskilled jebs in the local construction sector. Its environmental program will improve living and
working conditions in Be, the poorest and least developed district of Lome. The project is consistent with
the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) which is circulated separately. Finally, Togo's government is
eager to that IDAt act as investment catalyst and donor coordinator in its urban sector.
18.   Agreed Actions. Prior to negotiations, the Government forwarded to IDA a letter confirming
the its agreement in principle:
*     To establish and maintain an Urban Management Steering Committee (CCGU) composed
of the Mayor of Lom6 and representatives of the Ministries of Planing, Territorial
Administration, Economy and Finance, and Equipment and of the Be Development
Committee.
*     To estabish a Technical Secretariat (STCC) within the MEM (with adequate numbers of
qalified staff satisfactory to the Association) to prepare policies and decisions to be
approved by the CCGU.
*     To establish and maintain an independent agency, AGETUR (with adequate numbers of
qualified staff satisfactory to the Association) to manage contracts with private firms to
implement civil works financed under the project.
*     'jo establish one special account for AGETUR and one for the MEM (acting on behalf
of the STCC)
*     To delegate authority for procurement and disbursement of civil works (conta  award
and signature of disbursmuent requests) to the director of AGETUR. (A draft subsidiary
agreement between Government and AGETUR detailing these arrangements will be
reviewed during negotiations).
Before negotiations, IDA also received the Terms of Reference for CARE-Togo, which will be in charge
of the project's Environmental Management Training Program for community development.
19.   During negotiations, Togo's govermment also agreed:
1.    To give IDA a draft of the subsidiary agreement between the Borrower and AGETUR
(to be reviewed by IDA and deemed satisfactory).



iv                                                       Togo Urban Development Project
2.    To appoint and maintain as director of AGETUR an individual whose employment
experience and qualifications are deemed satisfactory to the Association.
3.    To transmit the annual work and studies programs approved by the CCGU to IDA for
review at least one month before their submission to AGETUR for implementation (with
consultation for detailed technical studies).
4.    That the government's contribution to infrastructure financing and maintenance be
reviewed.
5.    That-before dredging commences and every six months thereafter-the government
(CCGU along with the Nationt' Directorate for Sanitation and the University of Benin)
will monitor changes in the functioning of the lagoon system, the new sanitation
mechanisms installed, and the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the
lake water.
6.    That-six months after the urban transport study's final report is submitted-agreement
will be reached with IDA on implementation of the Road Safety Measures and
Community-Generated Improvements subcomponent.
7.    That CARE-Togo Terms of Reference be reviewed.
8.    That a model microproject contract be examined and finalized.
9.    That arrangements for the two special accounts for STCC and AGETUR be agreed upon
and included in the Credit Agreement.
10.   That specifications for midterm and anmnal project reviews, specifications for the
preparation and monitoring of project implementation plans, and a format for quarterly
progress reports be finalized. Quarterly reports will include a list of performance indica-
tors (including a procurement review) to be monitored during imp'ementation and will
be transmitted by the executing agencies at the latest one month after the end of each
quarter. Standard bidding documents would be used for works contracts.
11.   That agreement be reached on a draft Project Implementation Manual.
12.   That govenmment confirmation be sought (through the CCGU) throughout the project to
ensure that auditing of the accounts of both implementing agencies (covering project
accounts and special accounts) is carried out according to the agreed schedule; that the
implementing agencies submit quarterly and annual reports as required; and that-after
approval by the Comite de Be and the CCGU-the proposed microprojects program is
submitted quarterly to IDA for review.

20.   Conditions for Presentation to the Board:
*     Pursuant to the applicable legislation, the Borrower has established al. Urban
Management Steering Committee (CCGU) on teins and conditions satisfactory to IDA.
*     Pursuant to the applicaticable legislation, the Borower has established AGETUR on
terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA.
*     The Borrower has appointed as director of AGETUR an individual whose experience and
qualifications are satisfactory to IDA.
21.   Conditions for Credit Effectiveness:
*     Agreement (satisfactory to IDA, the Borrower, CDB, and the Mu'ucipality of Lome)
regarding CDB's and the Municipality of Lom6's contribution to the Project's
:mplementation.
-     Signature by the Govermnent (through the CCGU) of the agreement with CARE-Togo
for the implementation of the EMPT in the project's community participation component.
*     Agreement (satisfactory to the IDA) on the form and substancea of model contract for
the execution of microprojects.
*     Establishment (under conditions acceptable to IDA) of working groups responsible for
the preparation of the Municipal Development Action Plan.
*     .Signature of a subsidiary agreement between Government and the project-implementing
agency AGETUR.
*      5Establishment of a project-accounting system (satisfactory to IDA).
22.   Environmental Impact. Inproving Lome's environment and sanitary conditions is a major
project objective. The proposed project design was reviewed during appraisal and found to be
environmentally sound. Overall, the project should improve Lome's environmental quality, and any
negative consequences will be addressed in the details of project engineering. (A detailed Environmental
Impact Study was transmitted to the Project Information Center and will be made available in the Togo
through the MEM.)
23.   Major Program Objective. Poverty Reducdon. Because at least 40 percent of project
financing will flow directly into the local economy in the form of labor-intensive civil works, the project's
impact on the local economy in general-and on the construction industry in particular-should be
immediate. Assuming that at least 30 percent of local contracts in the construction sector is spent on
salaries and wages for unskilIed labor, more than US$4.5 million will go directly to the poorest urban
workers. This would create 1.1 million work days at mostly (90 percent) unsldlled jobs.
24.   Environmental sanitation inprovements resulting from drainage works and maintenance would
benefit about 180,000 poor urban residents. The project's other community-based improvements stand
to benefit a total of 30,000 poor Be residents.



Togo Urban Development Projea
25.   Project Benefits. The internal rate of return (IRR) of this project's urban road works would be
sreater than 18 percent. As noted above, it is estimated that more than 180,000 residents would benefit
from reductions in exposure to water-borne diseases. Local government capacity-building would improve
the nwmnagement of urban growth and the provision of urban services. Perhaps most importantly, the
proj.t will immediately add at least 1.1 million unskilled work days to the local economy, while
wiprovements to traffic and roads will provide longer-term economic and environmental benefits.
26.   Project Risks. The main risks to project implementation are possible political instability, a
difficnlt economic situation following two years of political turmoil, and the recent decision to devaluate
the CPA franc by 50 percent. During postappraisal, however, the government clearly expressed its
commitment to the project's objectives, emphasizing its potential impact on the urban poor.
27.   Other implementation risks concern the ability of the newly-created AGETLR to execute the
project and of STCC's ability to supervise it. The capability of both agencies, however, could bolstered
by the provision of short-term technical assistance, administntive and accounting support, and the
restriction of project implementation not to exceed these agencies' managerial capacity. As municipal
finances inprove and community participation develops (with support provided by the project),
futhermore, local resources of support for these programs should increase. AGETUR should be
sustainable beyond the project implementation period, and. experience with similar agencies in neighboring
countries show that-as competence and confidence grow-external funding for their operations also
increases.
28.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Arncles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.

Assessment of Pordolo
D.1    As of May 31, 1991, Bank Group commitments in Togo totalled US$538.6 million, consistng
of thirty-six IDA credits (amounting to US$ 535.1 million) and an IBRD loan of US$ 3.5 million. Total
IDA disbursements amounted to US$382 million, with 19 IDA credits; and the IBRD loan fiuly
disbursed. Togo has also benefitted from Bank support for regional operations, including two credits to
the West African Development Bank (BOAD), two credits for the feasibility study and construction of
the Nangbeto Regional Hydroelectric Project, and a Bank loan and an IDA credit (totalling to US$ 55.2
million) to CIMAO, a now closed regional clinker plant.
D.2   IDA credits have financed both adjustment (US$192.3 million) and investment (US$338.5 million)
operations. While IDA has been involved in virtually all sectors, the main areas of emphasis has been
agriculture (US$117 million, 22 percent of total commitments) and transport infrastructure (US$89
million, 17 percent of total commitments). IDA also gave four credits for strutural adjustment (totalling
US$178.1 million) and one for health sector adjustment (US$14.2 million).
D.3   IDA operations in Togo have generally proceeded satisfactorily, although with delays. Togo's
compliance with legal covenants in IDA credits (in terms of audits and procurement rules) has also been
generally good. There has been a steady decline in projects execution performance ratings, however,
over the last several years. This decline can generally be attributed to a lack of government commitment,
vested interests' interferance in projects implementation, and institutional capacity constraints (despite
substantial IDA support for programs to improve public sector resource management, that is, four
projects totalling US$17 million).
D.4   IFC currently has two investments in Togo: a loan of US$1.2 million equivalent to Ducros-Togo,
a food-processing company serving Togo and neighboring countries, and an equity investment of US$1.7
million in Tagatose, a privatized textile firm producing textiles and garments.
