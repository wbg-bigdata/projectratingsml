MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A FAMILY HEALTH PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan of SDR 31.8 million (US$45.0 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard
IDA terms, with 35 years maturity, and would help finance a family health
project. The project will also be financed, under parallel arrangements, by the
United Kingdom Overseas Development Administration (ODA -- US$2.8 million
equivalent) and by the Save the Children Fund (UK) (SCF -- US$1.0 million
equivalent).
2.    Backgrumd.  pakistan's demographic and health characteristics are similar
to those of many developing countries: high fertility, low life expectancy,
widespread infectious and communicable diseases and high maternal and child
mortality, coupled with a young age structure and increasing urbanization.
Health and demographic indicators remain poor.   Socio-cultural barriers to
improving health status, particularly for women and children, are high.
3.    Pakistan's population of over 110 million, growing at some 3.1X per annum,
with 451 of the population under 15 years of age, fertility among the highest
in Asia and low contraceptive use presents very serious problems and constraints
to the further economic and social development of the country. Expectation of
life at birth has improved slowly during the 1980s but infant mortality, at 107
per thousand, remains high. Maternal mortality, estimated at 600 per 100,000
live births, is particularly high and is the major factor in the high overall
Female relative to male mortality.   A vicious circle has formed of high
fertility, frequent births, high maternal mortality and morbidity, and high
infant mortality -- which in turn maintains the high birth rate. Perinatal
deaths are mainly due to delivery complications, poor maternal health and
tetanus.    Child  mortality  is  dominated  by  infectious  diseases  with
gastrointestinal infections being the most common; malaria and malnutrition are
important  contributory  factors.    Despite  general  availability  of  food,
malnutrition is a major problem, particularly for children and pregnant/lactating
women, with little improvement during the past decade.
4.    Traditionally, resources and riority in the public health sector went to
hospital, medical school and curative care development while primary and
preventive services were neglected. A greater focus on basic (rural) health
services, especially infrastructure, began in the mid-1970s but the effective
priority given to preventive services, outreach and health education remains
limited. Recent policy has sought to address many of these deficiencies but,
despite some successes, important parts of the primary health care initiatives
remain largely unimplemented. Little priority is given to the population program
either by politicians or administrators and it is still seen by many as a
sensitive subject. The private modern health sector is large and growing but
mainly confined to urban areas and to curative care. The involvement of non-
government organizations in the sector is limited; traditional medicine continues
to be extensively practiced.
5.    Health staff policy has typically focussed on doctors.  The result is
substantial over-supply and unemployment of young medical graduates and under-



supply of nurses and paramedical staff, especially of females, resulting in
severe operational problems particularly in providing services for women. The
performance of primary health facilities has not kept pace with their rapid
expansion; service quality, outreach and utilization are low due to systemic
problems of manpower, management, finance, staff attitudes and the social
setting. Service quality is adversely affected by management and organizational
deficiencies including inefficiencies resulting from the lack of integration of
service provision at the periphery, little community involvement, and
coordination problems within the complex public health service system and with
other related organizations such as the entirely separate population program.
Few health facilities currently offer family planning services. The emergenzy
and referral system is ineffective.   Health education and nutrition are
neglected. Despite some recent increases, the public health sector continues
to be under-funded.
6.    Rationale for IDA Involvement. Through its policy dialogue, IDA has been
advocating strongly the need for increased government activity in the social
sectors, the development of which has lagged badly despite Pakistan's economic
progress. The proposed project, which is the Bank's first major involvement in
the health sector, would make a contribution to implementing key primary health
including family planning related aspects of the government's policy and thereby
redress some of the present imbalances. It will focus on the poor, try to make
better use of past infrastructure investment and strengthen important neglected
areas.  Other donor involvement in the sector is limited but established;
compared to nearby countries, Pakistan receives little external assistance for
its health sector. Although IDA has financed no previous health sector projects,
a population project was completed in December 1989. It achieved only limited
success due to: (a) the erosion of political support for the population program;
(b) an under-estimate of the institutional constraints on implementation; and
(c) difficulties arising from the unusual distribution of responsibilities
between the federal and provincial levels.   These lessons, together with
experience from other donors and from implementing projects in other social
sectors, have been taken into account in preparing the proposed project. This
project should be seen as the first phase of the Bank's involvement in the sector
with extensions following to other geographical and subject areas if experience
is encouraging; the project is potentially a catalyst for larger scale
developments in the sector.
7.    Project Obiectives. The project has three main objectives: (a) to improve
the health status of the population within the provinces of Sindh and North-
West Frontier (NWFP); (b) to increase the effectiveness of the existing health
care network; and (c) to build the institutional capacity to realize the above
objectives and to set the stage for future interventions.
8.    Project Descrlption.  The proposed project has three main components: (a)
strengthening health services in Sindh and NWFP in two priority fields through:
(i) introducing an enhanced package of maternal health services including family
planning, and (ii) integrating and expanding communicable disease control
activities, mainly in rural areas but with some experiments in urban areas.
Together these will improve access, quality and utilization of health services;
(b) staff development aimed at improving staff capabilities and performance and
increasing the number of female paramedical staff through (i) a comprehensive
in-service training program, and (ii) expanded female paramedical training
capacity and improved staff retention through job enhancement and incentives;



. 3 -
and (c) management and orgarizational development aimed at improving management
capabilities through (i) increased institutional capacity, and (ii) improved
management quality and efficiency.
9.    The total cost of the seven-year project is estimated at US$62.9 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$20.4 million equivalent
(322). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
The amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Pakistan are given in Schedules C and
D respectively.   A map showing the geographical coverage of the project is
attached.   The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9345-PAK is being distributed
separately.
10.   Agreed  Actions.    During  Negotiations,  the  Federal  and  Provincial
Governments as appropriate provided assurances that: (a) a review of experience
with Community Health Workers, both within and without Pakistan, will be
conducted, that the study will be completed by December 1992, and that the
results will be discussed with the Association before large numbers of Community
Health Workers are recruited and trained; (b) by Decerfber 1993 about half of all
government health facilities in Sindh and NWFP will offer family planning
services and all such facilities will offer family planning services by July
1995; (c) the provincial staff development team will be established and
adequately staffed by July 1992; (d) a review of the incentives and service
conditions of female paramedical staff will be conducted by December 1992, the
findings discussed with the Association, and the implementation of agreed
measures started by December 1993; (e) at least 751 of the prof2ssional staff
of the Provincial Health Development Centres will be recruited by July 1992 with
the Centres being fully staffed by July 1993, and at least 75X of the
professional staff for the District Health Centres will be recruited by the ernd
of the first year of their operation with the balance appointed during the second
year; (f) each province will review annually with the Association the funds
required for the following fiscal year for carrying out both the project and for
meeting all recurrent health expenditures, with the recommendations from this
review reflected in the budget proposals; and the Federal Government and the
Association will also review annually the funds required for carrying out the
project to ensure the availability of such funds; (g) each province will
establish by December 1991 a project Steering Committee; (h) each provincial
Project Implementation Unit will be established and staffed by January 1992 and
the Project Implementation Units will remain adequately staffed with full-time
personnel; (i) arrangements with local universities and non-governmental
organizations for obtaining technical support for the project by the provinces
will begin during the first project year and continue throughout the project;
(j) all remaining sites will be acquired and available by December 1993; and
(k) standard requirements will be met including: progress reports on the project;
satisfactory basic accounting arrangements for annual audits; administration of
the Special Accounts; use of Statements of Expenditure; preparation of a Project
Completion Report; and the use of IDA Procurement Guidelines and satisfactory
LCB procedures.
11.   The agreed Conditions of Credit Effectiveness are: (a) approval of the
project PC-1 documents by the Executive Committee of the Federal Government's
National Economic Council; and (b) the signing of agreements for the provision



- 4 -
of the main Technical Assistance consultants for management services, for
training development services and project monitoring.
12.   Enviroraental ConsLderatiQn.  The proposed project has been reviewed and
was determine< to be in screening Category C, which includes projects that are
expected to have no significant negative environmental impact. No environmental
analysis will be prepared for this project.
13.   Benefita.  The project will improve the health status of the population
generally but with a special emphasis on high risk and other under-privileged
sections of the community. Women would benefit particularly, through improved
maternal health services including increased availability of family planning.
By project completion, the health services available to some 80X of the total
population of the two provinces (including 9 million women of childbearing age)
would improve. Service use is expected to increase from present low levels,
especially for women and children, with a doubling to 35-50X of pregnant women
in the catchment area receiving some prenatal care and, similarly, a doubling
in the proportion of deliveries supervised. The government will benefit from
the various institutional development components which would also pave the way
for more ambitious objectives to be achieved through subsequent investments.
14.   Risks.  The project faces three main risks.  The most important is the
limited implementation capacity, and lack of large project experience, of the
provincial Departments of Health.  This risk is addressed through having a
substantial management strengthening component, simplifying the prcject design,
and providing technical assistance  in key  areas.   The  second  is  that
strengthening public health systems and particularly focusing on women's health
problems including family planning may not receive sufficient priority from the
present health system; this risk is minimized through the full involvement of
senior health and population officials in project preparation resulting in a
strong commitment to the project, the project reinforcing key parts of the
governmentIs health policy with its strong primary and maternal/child care focus,
the early and continuing involvement of public health orientated -cal university
departments and NGOs, and the establishment of coordination mechanisms. Finally,
as this project will mainly be implemented in two provinces which are largely
independent of each other, there are risks of difficulties of project
supervision. Such risks have been offset by incorporating additional monitoring
resources, recommending more intensive than normal IDA supervision and through
provision for regular inter-provincial meetings.
15.  Reeg    4 tX. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Credit.
