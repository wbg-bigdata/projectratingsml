MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A WOMEN'S HEALTH AND SAFE MOTHERHOOD PROJECT
1.       I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan to the Philippines for the equivalent of US$18.0 million to
help finance a Women's Health and Safe Motherhood Project. The loan would be
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years,
including 5 years of grace. Cofinancing totalling US$91.8 million equivalent
would be provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Australian
International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB), the European Commission
(EC) and Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) of Germany.
2.       Country/Sector Background.  Health indicators in the Philippines are
considerably worse than in countries of comparable socio-economic status.
The incidence of communicable diseases, the status of women's health, and levels
of maternal and child mortality and malnutrition are areas of particular
concern.   In addition,  the country's Primary Health Care (PHC) program now
functions under a system of devolution mandated by the 1991 Local Government
Code. About 1600 provincial, city and municipal local government units (LGUs)
have assumed responsibility for planning, financing and implementing health
programs in their jurisdictions. The Department of Health (DOH) continues to
provide policy and technical support, and will use funds remaining within its
control to influence local government spending toward the achievement of
national public health goals. Six national priority programs are identified by
the DOH in its Ten-Year Public Investment Plan (PIP): women's health and safe
motherhood; early childhood development; control of prevalent diseases; health
service capacity improvement; environmental health; and health financing. The
proposed project would support the first program.
3.       In the Philippines, the poor health and nutritional status of women is
revealed by low birth weight in about 18% of babies and iron-deficiency anemia
in the majority of infants (50% of women are themselves anemic).   Maternal
mortality is 208 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, according to the first
Demographic and Health Survey conducted in 1993, and even the lower, official
figure of 74 is twice  that of Thailand.   One-third of married women of
reproductive age (15-45 years) report an unmet need for contraceptive services,
and the total fertility rate remains high at 4.3, compared to 3.4 in Indonesia
and 3.0 in Thailand.   To date, women's health concerns have been addressed
mainly through the DOH Maternal and Child Health (MCH) and Family Planning (FP)
Programs. However, the MCH Program has focussed on interventions for the child,
and the FP Program has been hampered by technical deficiencies, powerful and
vocal opposition to the program, and vacillating political support of previous
administrations. In contrast, the current Government has committed to providing
a basic package of women's health services, including family planning. This
commitment is a concrete manifestation of the Government's endorsement of the
Cairo Program of Action of the September 1994 International Conference on
Population and Development in Cairo, which called for a special emphasis on
investments to reduce high rates of maternal mortality, to educate and empower
women, and to increase access to safe and effective family planning and
reproductive health information and services.

4.       Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement.  The Bank Group has
supported four projects in the population, health and nutrition sector in the
Philippines.   Project Performance Audit Reports  (PPARs) for the first two
projects, Population I (Ln. 1035-PH, approved 1974, closed 1982) and Population
II (Cr. 0923-PH, approved 1979, closed 1988), concluded that while the projects
failed to fully achieve their population objectives, they should be credited
with establishing a nationwide PHC structure, including the para-professional,
community-based  midwife  cadre.    The  proposed  project  would  continue  to
strengthen the PHC system and further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness
of midwives through better service integration and training. As recommended by
the PPAR for Population II, the proposed project would also integrate FP
services with the DOH's PHC and MCH programs, and thereby improve the FP
program's likelihood of success.
5.       Two  other  Bank-supported  health  projects  are  currently  under
implementation.    The  Philippine  Health Development  Project  (Ln.  3099-PH,
approved 1989) is performing reasonably well, but has been hampered by uneven
cash flows due to the Government's inefficient practices relating to budget
releases and utilization of project Special Accounts. The proposed project has
been included in the Government's Core Public Investment Program, which ensures
full funding for high-priority public investment projects; and improved
arrangements for the operation of Special Accounts in the Philippines (which,
among others, would allow implementing agencies direct access to the Account.;)
have been agreed upon with the Bank.  Project costs are also being linked to
project implementation plans in order to develop realistic forecasts of cash
flow requirements.   The Urban Health and Nutrition Project  (Cr. 2506-PH,
approved 1993) is the first post-devolution project in the sector, and the
experience in preparing and launching this project has been utilized to work out
devolution-related issues for the proposed project.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's country assistance strategy
(CAS) for the Philippines presented to the Board in February 1994 aims to assist
the Government to attain the following key development objectives: (a) maintain
a sound macroeconomic framework; (b) improve the business climate for private
enterprise; (c) remove infrastructure bottlenecks; (d) protect the environment;
and (e) alleviate poverty through economic growth and the provision of basic
social services.   The proposed project is consistent with and would be an
important component of the CAS.  It would provide a basic package of health
services for women, which would both contribute to poverty alleviation and
improve the human resource base required for sustained economic growth.
7.       The Bank has an established relationship with the Government in the
health sector and has assisted the DOH in identifying national health priorities
and resource requirements. The Bank's sector report on family planning (Report
No. 9579-PH, 1991) was instrumental in the Government's adoption of a health
rationale for family planning, and in the DOH's decision to give priority to
developing an integrated women's health and safe motherhood project. The Bank
has assisted the Government in mobilizing a substantial amount of concessional
and grant financing for the project, and would cover the remaining financing
gap. The Bank is also helping the DOH in pioneering the development of health
risk assessment and targeting mechanisms to more effectively direct limited
resources to the poor.   Finally,  the Bank is playing a critical role in
assisting the DOH to address the consequences of devolution, building on its



- 3 -
sector report on the impact of devolution on health service delivery (Report No.
12343-PH, 1993), and by helping to prepare and implement projects under a
devolved system.
8.       Project Objectives.  The project's overall objectives are to improve
the health status of women, with particular focus on women of reproductive age,
and thereby support the Government's long-term goals of reducing fertility,
female morbidity and maternal mortality. Its specific objectives would be to:
(a) improve the quality and range of women's health services; (b) strengthen the
capacity of LGUs to manage the provision of these services, and of the DOH to
provide  technical,   logistical  and  financial  support;   (c) enhance  the
effectiveness  and  sustainability  of  health  interventions   through  the
participation of local communities and NGOs in the project; and (d) expand the
country's knowledge base upon which to draw policy and technical guidance for
women's health programs.
9.       Project  Description.    The  major  project  components  would  be:
(a) service delivery (63% of total project cost) in the areas of (i) maternal
care (covering pre- and post-natal care, safe delivery and micronutrient
supplementation),  (ii) family  planning,  (iii) diagnosis  and  treatment  of
reproductive tract infections and sexually-transmitted diseases (RTIs/STDs); and
(iv) detection and treatment of cervical cancer; (b) institutional development
(27%), including (i) training for public sector health care providers of women's
health services, (ii) information, education and communication (IEC) programs,
(iii) development of a public health logistics system to ensure efficient
commodity procurement and delivery to end users, and (iv) project management;
(c) community health partnerships (9%), which would provide grants for
communities and NGOs working with local governments and the DOH in planning and
implementing community-based women's health services; and (d) policy and
operations research (1%) to conduct studies on alternative approaches to service
delivery, and on other women's health problems, including breast cancer and
violence against women.   To implement these components,  the project would
finance civil works, furniture, equipment, vehicles, training, technical
assistance, grants to NGOs, micronutrients, drugs, reagents and other medical
supplies, contract staff salaries and other incremental operating costs.
10.      Proiect Implementation.  The project would be implemented over a five-
year period (1995-99) by the DOH and local health offices at the provincial/
city, municipal and barangay (i.e., village) levels.  Project activities would
be integrated as regular public health program functions. LGUs would play the
principal implementation role, while the DOH would provide technical, financial
and logistical support.   The National Government would allocate and on-grant
project funds to LGUs on the basis of need and under variable cost-sharing
arrangements. Day-to-day coordination would be the responsibility of a Project
Management Office (PMO) in the DOH, reporting to the Undersecretary/Chief of
Staff.   A Project Steering Committee,  chaired by the Project Director and
comprising Undersecretaries of the DOH and other concerned Government agencies,
would provide policy guidance on the implementation of the project and approve
annual implementation plans and budgets.
11.      The  total cost of the project  is estimated at US$136.4  million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$72.6 million, and taxes and
duties estimated at US$1.24 million equivalent. The proposed loan of US$18.0



- 4 -
million would finance about 13% of total project costs, including 15% of foreign
exchange and 11% of local costs. In addition, the project would be financed by:
(a) a local contribution of US$26.7 equivalent, mainly through cost-sharing
arrangements designed to result in an LGU contribution of at least 15% of the
total project cost; and (b) cofinancing contributions totalling US$91.8 million.
Specifically:  (i) an ADB concessional loan of US$54.0 million equivalent would
finance maternal care, IEC and project management; (ii) an AIDAB grant of
US$10.6 million equivalent would finance the training sub-component; (iii) an
EC grant of US$13.0 million equivalent would finance the community partnerships
component; (iv) a KfW grant of $14.2 million equivalent would finance medical
equipment, drugs and reagents for maternal care, family planning and RTIs/STDs;
and (v) the IBRD loan would cover the remaining financing gap for other women's
health services, training, logistics and research.
12.      A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A.   Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.   A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the Philippines are
presented in Schedules C and D, respectively.   A map is also attached.   The
Staff Appraisal  Report,  No.  13566-PH,  dated January  27,  1995,  is being
distributed separately.
13.      Project Sustainability.  To help ensure the financial sustainability
of the project, the DOH has developed the PIP as the framework for measuring
project investments in light of total resources available to the sector, the
impact project investments would have on health expenditures, and the priority
the Government attaches to the project. Under the project, funds would be made
available through cost-sharing arrangements in which participating LGUs would
absorb an increasing share of recurrent costs. Increased community awareness
of and involvement in project activities would help generate popular demand for
sustained budgetary commitments to women's health care. The project would also
support training, technical assistance and administrative systems to help
strengthen the technical and managerial skills of DOH and LGU staff, and thereby
develop the institutional capacities required to sustain the delivery of women's
health services and their expected benefits beyond the project.
14.      Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, keyunderstandingsandagreements
were reached with the Government on the Project Implementation Agreements (PIAs)
governing LGU participation in the project, and the principles and criteria for
resource allocation to and cost sharing with LGUs. The PIAs to be entered into
between the DOH and individual LGUs would stipulate the project activities that
the LGU is committing to undertake and/or support, the financing share of the
National Government to be allocated and made available to the LGU on a grant
basis, the financing share of the LGU, and the delineation of tasks and
responsibilities of the DOH and the LGU in project implementation. A decision
support model incorporating health status, health expenditure, demographic and
poverty indicators would be used as the basis for allocating project resources
and determining the appropriate cost-share levels to be borne by LGUs.
15.      Agreement was reached during negotiations that the Government would
establish and maintain until project completion the PMO, headed by a qualified
Project Manager and staffed by qualified personnel in adequate numbers.
Agreement was further reached that, not later than July 1, 1995, the Government



- 5 -
would:   (a) establish the Project Steering Committee;  (b) designate the DOH
Undersecretary/Chief of Staff and Assistant Secretary for Special Concerns as
the Project Director and Project Coordinator, respectively; (c) employ and
assign to the PMO a Desk Officer, acceptable to the Bank, who shall be
responsible for overseeing the implementation of activities financed out of the
proceeds of the loan; and (d) assign to the DOH Regional Field Offices
responsibility in their respective regions for coordination of project
implementation, monitoring of progress in project performance, assisting in the
collection  of  documentation  to  support  statements  of  expenditures,  and
preparation of financial statements and accounts.
16.      Agreement was also reached during negotiations that the DOH shall:
(a) not later than December 31 of each year, beginning in 1995, update its
project implementation plan in consultation with the Bank; (b) not later than
June 30 and December 31 of each year, beginning in 1995, furnish to the Bank
semi-annual reports on progress in project performance; and (c) by June 30,
1998, carry out a comprehensive mid-term review of project implementation on the
basis of terms of reference developed in consultation with the Bank.
17.      The establishment of the PMO and appointment of the Project Manager
would be conditions of loan effectiveness. The following would be conditions
of loan disbursement: (a) effectiveness of the cofinancing agreement with KfW,
in respect of expenditures for drugs and reagents for the RTIs/STDs sub-
component of the project; and (b) effectiveness of the cofinancing agreement
with AIDAB, in respect of expenditures for consultant services, studies and
training for the training sub-component of the project.    (The conditions
pertaining to the PMO adequately cover the Bank's concerns with the ADB
cofinancing agreement; and no condition is required for the EC grant since there
is less cross-dependency between the community partnerships component, which
will be fully financed by the EC, and other project components.)
18.      Poverty Category.  Providing basic health services is a key element of
poverty alleviation, and treating the major causes of disability and premature
death for women ranks among the most cost-effective health interventions and
yields some of the highest social and economic benefits.   Poor women would
benefit most from the project because they are disproportionately affected by
the disease burden, tend to have larger family sizes, and are the main users of
public health facilities and services. The project would also apply specific
health risk assessment and targeting mechanisms for directing resources to the
poor and vulnerable, including area-based and life cycle approaches to service
delivery, and the use of resource allocation and cost-sharing indices which
incorporate poverty indicators.
19.      Environmental Aspects.  The project would not have a negative impact
on the environment and has been ranked "C" for environmental assessment
purposes.   In the long-term, an effective women's health program would lower
fertility rates and reduce the environmental pressures associated with rapid
population growth.
20.      Program Objective Categories.   By investing in women's health,  the
project supports the mutually reinforcing strategies of reducing poverty and
harnessing the contribution of women to development. As the primary targets of
the project, project benefits would accrue directly to women. In addition, the



- 6 -
project would provide further training for the mainly female midwife cadre which
would deliver most of the services under the project, thus increasing their
skill level and status. Women's groups are likely to represent a substantial
proportion of the beneficiaries of the community partnerships component, and the
policy and operations research component would help to establish the scope of
other women's health problems and to define appropriate public health responses.
21.      Participatory Approach.  In 1992, the DOH organized a National Women's
Health Task Force, comprising representatives from professional health
associations, the academic community, women's groups and other non-governmental
organizations. The Task Force worked closely with the DOH in identifying and
preparing the project, with the women's groups playing a particularly active
role. The Task Force is expected to continue its involvement with the project,
particularly in monitoring project implementation.   The project would also
directly support NGO and beneficiary participation through the community
partnerships component; and the project's IEC strategy would utilize women's
groups and communities as channels of communication to reach service providers
and the public with messages designed to improve women's health practices and
provide information about the availability of women's health services.
22.      Proiect Benefits.  The main project benefit would be better health for
women as a result of improved access to women's health services.   Project
beneficiaries are estimated to include: about 4 million pregnant women; about
500,000 of these pregnant women who will suffer from obstetric complications;
about 1.7 million women of reproductive age who have declared an unmet need for
family planning services and a preference for voluntary surgical contraception;
an estimated 300,000 women who would not otherwise be diagnosed or treated for
RTIs/STDs; and an estimated 1.1 million women who would be screened for cervical
cancer. Better health for women would eventually be reflected in reduced levels
of fertility, female morbidity and maternal mortality. These improvements would
have substantial spillover benefits on the productivity of women and that of
their households and communities, and on the survival, health and education
outcomes of their children.   Progress in realizing these benefits would be
assessed on the basis of monitoring indicators agreed upon with the Government.
23.      The project's  institutional benefits would include:   building the
capacity of LGUs in managing health programs, and of the DOH in providing
support to local governments;  and involving NGOs and project beneficiaries
in developing and implementing solutions to women's health problems in their
communities.   Finally, research on priority women's health issues will help
design future interventions that can further enhance the quality of women's
lives.
24.      Risks.  Two main risks relate to implementing a project of national
scope in a devolved system. First, LGUs can decide to opt out of the project;
populations in such jurisdictions could not therefore benefit from the project
and national program objectives would be threatened. To address this risk, the
following measures have been undertaken: (a) cost-sharing arrangements would
provide financial incentives for LGU participation; (b) the project has been
designed for phased implementation by province, giving the DOH time to negotiate
acceptable arrangements with other LGUs; (c) the DOH has engaged the LGUs in an
ongoing dialogue to build commitment to national health priorities, including
the proposed project; and (d) women's NGOs and community groups were actively



- 7 -
involved in project preparation and are likely to press local officials to
participate in the project.  The second devolution-related risk is that LGUs
would not have the capacity to implement the project; institution-building
activities are thus included in the project wherever appropriate.   Phased
implementation of the project will also ensure that adequate training will have
been provided before service activities are undertaken in a particular
jurisdiction.
25.      A third project risk is that implementation would be delayed by the
lack of adequate cash flows which have plagued other projects in the sector.
This risk has been reduced by actions taken on the country portfolio level to
ensure that a limited number of priority projects, including the proposed
project, would be fully funded; the new Special Account arrangements are also
expected to improve the situation. Finally, there is the risk of insufficient
coordination of activities financed by the various donors. This risk would be
minimized by assigning overall responsibility for the project to the PMO in the
DOH, agreeing upon an integrated implementation plan, and conducting joint
annual reviews during implementation.
26.      Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
