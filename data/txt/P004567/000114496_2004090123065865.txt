for appropriate adjustment of bid price to reflect changes in
the cost of inputs for the contract over the period of
extension.  Such an increase in the bid price shall not be
taken into account in the bid evaluation. With respect to each
contract made subject to the Bank's prior review in accordance
with the provisions of Part D.1. of this Section, the Bank's
prior approval will be required for: (i) a first extension of
the bid validity period, if the period of extension exceeds
sixty (60) days; and (ii) any subsequent extension of the bid
validity period.
    (b) In the procurement of goods in accordance with this Part
A, the Borrower shall use the relevant standard bidding
documents issued by the Bank, with such modifications thereto
as the Bank shall have agreed to be necessary for the purposes

grouped into bid packages estimated to cost the equivalent of
two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) or more.

to the provisions of part A.1. hereof, (ii) the first contract
to be awarded pursuant to the provisions of Part C.1 hereof,
and (iii) each contract estimated to cost the equivalent of two
hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) or more, the procedures set

reasonably determined by the Bank; (iv) amendments to contracts
for consulting firms raising the contract value to the

                              Special Account
1.  For the purposes of this Schedule:
    (a) The term "Eligible Categories" means Categories (1),
(2), (3), (4) and (5) set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of
Schedule 1 to this Agreement;
    (b) The term "Eligible Expenditures" means expenditures in
respect of the reasonable cost of goods and services required
for the Project, and to be financed out of the proceeds of the
Loan, allocated from time to time to the Eligible Categories in
accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;
and
    (c) The term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount
equivalent to one million dollars ($1,000,000) to be withdrawn
from the Loan Account and deposited into the Special Account
pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule; provided,
however, that, unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, the
Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an amount equivalent
to three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) until the
aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Loan Account, plus the
total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered
into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General
Conditions, shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of five
million dollars ($5,000,000).
2.        Payments out of the Special Account shall be made
exclusively for Eligible Expenditures in accordance with the
provisions of this Schedule.
3.        After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it
that the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of
the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to
replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows:
    (a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a
deposit into the Special Account of an amount or amounts
determined by the Bank to be required to pay for Eligible
Expenditures during the four (4) months following the date of
each such request, which amount shall not exceed the aggregate
amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such
request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower,
withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special
Account such amount or amounts as the Bank shall have
determined to be so required.
    (b)   (i)   For replenishment of the Special Account, the
                Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for
                deposits into the Special Account at such
                intervals as the Bank shall specify.
Page  17
          (ii)  Prior to or at the time of each such request, the
                Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents
                and other evidence required pursuant to
                paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or
                payments in respect of which replenishment is
                requested. On the basis of each such request, the
                Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower,  withdraw
                from the Loan Account and deposit into the
                Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall
                have requested and as shall have been shown by
                said documents and other evidence to have been
                paid out of the Special Account for Eligible
                Expenditures.
    All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the
Loan Account under the respective Eligible Categories, and in
the respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified
by said documents and other evidence.
4.        For each payment made by the Borrower out of the
Special Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank
shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents
and other evidence showing that such payment was made
exclusively for Eligible Expenditures.
5.        Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further
deposits into the Special Account:
    (a) If, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly
from the Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of
Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of
Section 2.02 of this Agreement;
    (b) If the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the
Bank, within the period of time specified in Section 4.01 (b)
(ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of
the audit of the records and accounts for the Special Account;
    (c) If, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the
Borrower of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the
right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account
pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General
Conditions; or
    (d) Once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated
to the eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding
special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section
5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the Project,
shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the
Authorized Allocation.
    Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the
remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the
Eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank
shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further
withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the
Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining
on deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such notice
will be utilized in making payments for Eligible Expenditures.
6.        (a) If the Bank shall have determined, at any time,
that any payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for
an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to
paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the
evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly
upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence
as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the Special
Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank)
an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion
Page  18
thereof not so eligible or justified.  Unless the Bank shall
otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided
such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may
be.
    (b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required
to cover further payments for Eligible Expenditures, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to
the Bank such outstanding amount.
    (c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special
Account.
    (d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a),
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan
Account for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in
accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement,
including the General Conditions.
