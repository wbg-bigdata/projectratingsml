MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA
FOR A SECOND COFFEE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to Kenya
for SDR 36.5 million (US$46.8 million equivalent) to help finance a Second
Coffee Improvement Project is submitted for approval. The proposed Credit
would be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years and would be
on-lent to the Cooperative Bank of Kenya, except for US$2.9 million
equivalent which would be made available as a grant to the participating
Ministries. The project would be cofLnanced by the Commonwealth
Development Corporation (CDC) for US$18.0 million equivalent on a parallel
financing basis.
2.        Background:  The Government of Kenya's strategy for economic
growth, employment creation, and foreign exchange earnings depends
critically on a rapidly growing agricultural sector. The Governnent has
set annual growth targets for agricultural sector output at 51, employment
generation at 3?, and foreign exchange earnings at 6X. The strategy for
attaining these objectives includes: (a) intensification of existing
production through incentive pricing and improved smallholder services; (b)
a major research effort; and (c) expansion of high value crops such as
coffee, tea and horticultural export crops. Coffea, as the country's most
valuable export, generates about 250,000 years of employment annually and
earns 30Z of Kenya's foreign exchange. Kenya has a strong comparative
advantage in the production of high quality arabica coffee because of ideal
agro-climatic conditions. It has productive smallholders, a commercially
oriented cooperative sector, and is a successful exporter. Yet planning,
financial discipline, crop financing and implementation capabilities in
cooperatives, although improving, are still weak and there is a lack of
trained staff. Half of the present 800 coffee factories require
improvements to ensure high quality, and a limited number of new factories
are needed to ease congestior.. The proposed project is designed to
overcome these constraints.
3.        Rationale for IDA Involvement:  The Bank Group has, together
with CDC, been involved in smallholder coffee development since 1979.  The
first project (Credit 914-KE), which was completed in 1987, provided funds
for the construction and rehabilitation of 414 factories and seasonal
credit.  IDA has a compa.ative advantage in supporting technical
assistance, training and institutional building which are critical in
strengthening cooperative financial and technical management and
Government's capacity in policy planning and program development in the
sector. IDA's involvement would be important to Government in securing
continued cofinancing rffered by CDC. IDA's assistance in formulating
Government's long ter coffee policy would also discourage uneconomic
coffee area expansion schemes, and encourage crop diversification from a
position of export strength. The project is consistent with the Bank's
current guidelines on coffee projects, since it emphasizes improvements in



- 2 -
coffee quality and marketing arrangements while supporting production
increases from intensification ard rehabilitation in tune with world market
opportunities.
4.        Prolect Obiectives:  The main objective of the project would be
to raise incomes of smallholder and small estate coffee growers and farm
workers through increased productivity and quality improvements. Related
objectives are to (a) increase Kenya's foreign exchange earnings and help
it maintain its position as an efficient high quality coffee producer; and
(b) strengthen the institutional capacities of key participating agencies.
5.        Proiect DescriDtions  The project would include investments tos
(a) improve 275 factories and construct an additional 65 in the cooperative
sector; (b) provide credit for agricultural inputs; (c) finance the initial
credit requirements and improve the institutional arrangements to formulate
and implement an improved coffee payment system in the cooperative sector;
(d) improve production and processing on 230 small estates; (e) increase
Kenya's coffee milling capacity; (f) provide training and advisory services
to trainers, cooperative and factory managers and farmers to upgrade
existing coffee plantings and raise the proportion of high quality arabica
coffee; and (g) strengthen the planning, management and implementation
capacities of key participating agencies. The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$106.8 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$27.6
million (26Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and
the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Kenya
are given Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7967-KE dated August 18, 1989, is also
attached.
6.        Agreed Actionss   Financial and credit incentives to coffee
farmers require improvement. The project would support an improved coffee
payment system and provide funds for incremental seasonal credit. In
addition assurances were obtained that Government would continue to
progressively reduce the price differential on coffee sold for domestic
consumption, with a view to finally eliminating such price differential by
the time the domestic market disposals have reached 102 of total disposals.
Smallholder coffee quality is declining; this trend would be reversed by
project investments in factory improvements and support for a training
program for factory managera. Given the uncertainty of the international
coffee market, with fluctuating prices but a good demand for quality
arabica, and also given Kenya's unique position in this market, any future
expansion program requires careful analysis within a long term development
strategy. To build up this capability assurances were obtained that the
Coffee Board of Kenya would, by June 30, 1990, strengthen its
organizational structure. With increasing production, especially if quotas
are reintroduced, the Government needs to establish a coffee stock
management policy. Assurances were obtained that Government would review
several options and immediately upon the reimposition of coffee quotas



-3-
under an International Coffee Agreement inform IDA of the measures to be
taken for the better management of its coffee stocks. An improved Project
Coordination and Management Unit (PCMU) would be established with terms of
reference acceptable to IDA. Sample applications for factory investments
would be evaluated according to improved criteria acceptable to IDA.
Availability of funds in the Government's budget is not reliable; to ensure
adequate project funding, an assurance was obtained that the Government and
IDA would review and agree the project's forward and approved budrets on an
annual basis. Conditions of cvedit effectiveness would be: (a) adoption by
Government of an improved payment system satisfactory to IDA; (b)
establishment of an Inspection Committee in MOCD; (c) appointment of
technical assistance to assist the PCMU in Project start-up activities; and
(d) execution of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and the
Cooperative Bank.
7.        Benefits:  Increased coffee production and enhanced quality
under the project are expected to result in an economic rate of return of
about 29Z.  This is under the assumption that the current suspension of
coffee quotas continues throughout the life of the Project. Financial
rates of return for factories are expected to range between 22Z and 43Z.
The project would have a positive environmental impact, as coffee maintains
a good ground cover to protect the soil from erosion. Pesticide
applications would be reduced through the use of selective chemicals with a
short life of active ingredients, and the project would follow the
integrated pest control methodology recommended by the Coffee Research
Foundation. River water pollution at factories would be eliminated through
water recirculation systems. By project completion, the increased
production is expected to earn an extra US$51 million per year in foreign
exchange, improve the incomes of 230,000 coffee growers, and generate over
11,000 manyears of unskilled field work, a large proportion of which would
be for women.
8.        Risks:  Organizational and management risks would be minimized
by the establishment of a strong semi-autonomous Project Coordination and
Management Unit and the training of staff of key implementing agencies.
The risk that improvements in processing quality would not take place to
the extent envisaged would be minimized by the provision of technical and
managerial support services. The incremental coffee production is not
expected to have an adverse impact on the international market as Kenya's
total exports are only 3Z of world exports. The analytical capabilities of
the Coffee Board and the Cooperative Bank would be strengthened to ensure
that any future expansion in coffee production, beyond the project, would
be at an orderly rate and would not jeopardize Kenya's position in the
quality market. The project's rate of return is robust, when tested for
sensitivity to cost escalations, implementation delays and a drop in world
prices beyond those already experienced following suspension of coffee
quotas.

9.        Recommendatio.i.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
