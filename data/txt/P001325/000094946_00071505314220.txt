SECOND COFFEE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT (SCIP 11)
(IDA Cr 2062-KE)
PREFACE
1   This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Second Coffee
Improvement Project (SCIP II) in Kenya, for which Credit 2062-KE in the amount of
SDR 36 5 million (US$ 46 8 million equivalent) was approved on September 12, 1989
and became effective on August 1, 1990
2   The Credit was closed on June 30, 1998, compared with the original closing date
of June 30, 1997 US$ 45 9 million was disbursed from the IDA Credit Final
disbursement was made in March 1999, with approximately US$ 5 1 equivalent
remaining undisbursed, pending recovery and cancellation (these figures total more than
the original amount due to US$ appreciation against the SDR). Parallel financing for the
project was originally proposed through the Commonwealth Development Corporation
This did not proceed due to farmer rejection of the loan However, cofinancing of the
project, which supported existing SCIP credit lines, was subsequently provided by the
European Union through the STABEX funds facility This was not envisaged at
appraisal.
3   This ICR was prepared by staff' from the FAO/World Bank Cooperative
Programme, on behalf of the Africa Technical Division Rural Development Group 1
(AFTR1) of the World Bank. This report is based on material obtained during a mission
by FAOICP to Kenya from October 5 to 16, 1998 from the project files and supervision
reports, as well as discussions with Bank and Government of Kenya (GOK) staff
associated with the project These included staff from the Project Management
Coordination Unit (PCMU), the unit established under the project to co-ordinate the
implementation of the project, and officials in the Ministries of Cooperative
Development, and of Agriculture
4   The Government contributed to the preparation of the ICR through discussions on
the mission's Aide-Memoire, and furnished its own assessment of project performance A
copy of the Aide-Memoire of the ICR mission is attached as Appendix A, and the
Borrower's evaluation report, "SCIP II Impact Evaluation Report" is attached as
Appendix B. Comments were solicited from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development (which now contains the former Ministry of Cooperative Development) and
the Cooperative Bank on February 18, 2000 Comments were receieved from the
Cooperative Bank on March 7, 2000 and have been incorporated in the report.

SECOND COFFEE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT (SCIP II)
(Cr 2062-KE)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
I   The project was the second Bank-assisted project for the coffee sector in Kenya,
following the Smallholder Coffee Improvement Project (SCIP I) which started in 1979
SCIP I had a narrow focus on factory reconstruction to improve coffee quality and,
following its closure, the industry still required external support Efficiency for both
smallholder and estate coffee growers suffered from lack of available working capital,
and confidence of small coffee growers was low, exacerbated by the fact that payments
for coffee delivered were irregular and delayed by as much as 18 months
Project Objectives and Components
2 The main objective of SCIP II was to raise the incomes of smallholder and small
estate coffee farmers and workers through increased productivity and quality
improvements Related objectives were to (i) increase the country's foreign exchange
earnings and help it maintain its position in the coffee market by raising quality, and (ii)
strengthen the capacities of the key participating agencies
3   The strategy to achieve the objectives of the project was to streamline the payment
systems between the Coffee Board of Kenya through the societies to members, inject
short-term working capital and medium-term investment capital into the industry, and to
strengthen the key institutions involved The smaillolder farmers were to be directly
assisted through the introduction of improved payment systems for coffee sales, and three
credit schemes, operated by Coop Bank, for an advance payment for cherry delivery,
farm inputs, and factory development. Assistance to the small estate coffee farmers was
to take the form of a credit scheme for irrigation and field equipment, coffee processing
facilities and farm inputs The project also provided for financial assistance to the Kenya
Planters Cooperative Union (KPCU) to expand its milling capacity with a new facility at
Dandora The project was to expand the Coffee Research Foundation's (CRF) training
facilities and conduct training programs in coffee production and processing
Implementation Experience and Results
4. The project was approved in September 1989 and became effective a year later.
This delay resulted mainly from the time taken to introduce the improved payment
system, which was a condition of effectiveness Whilst the start-up process was slow
because of the preparations required in advance of the launch of the credit schemes,
particularly the technical design and appraisal work required for the factory development
implementation of the components of the project was satisfactory However, the
component designed to assist small estate owners, and for the financing of a new coffee



ih
mill, both through KPCU, did not proceed due to the rejection by the members of the
CDC loan. The original closing date of June 30, 1997 was extended to enable the factory
renovation program to be completed, and the credit closed on June 30 1998
Achievement of Objectives
5   The main activities of the project centered around changing the methods of
financing the working capital of the coffee industry, upgrading factory capacity and
facilities, and capacity building As a condition of effectiveness, the project was
instrumental in introducing an Improved Payment System (IPS) for coffee producers
This system provided for a prompt and direct payment mechanism for coffee sales to
significantly reduce the payment time lag that previously was a factor that curbed farmer
interest in growing coffee Inherent in the scheme were initiatives to control operating
costs of the societies Reviews of society operating expenses were undertaken to reduce
costs and to determine the proportion of sales value to be allocated to farmers accounts
and to society operations accounts. Over the period of the project, the proportion of
cooperative revenues that is paid to farmers increased from around 60% to an average of
69%, and in some of the societies with strong financial management, is now as high as
85% Before the project, only 38% of societies paid more than 70% of the gross
realization price, a figure which rose to 85% after the project To further improve the
cash flow of coffee farmers, the cherry advance payment scheme (CAPS) was introduced
to provide an advance payment at harvest for cherry delivered to cooperative society
factories This was financed by the Coop Bank through on-lending initially of the IDA
Credit and subsequently, STABEX funds to societies, and then to members These
changes had a positive impact on the timing of payments to farmers The CAPS scheme
gave farmers a cash payment following the delivery of cherry The period of receiving
the first payment after delivery of cherry was thereby reduced to less than around 2
months as opposed to about 12-13 months before the project After the project, 66% of
societies paid farmers in less than 4 months, compared to 28% before the project. The
IPS, in conjunction with the introduction of outside-the-pool payments, significantly
improved the cash flow of societies, enabling more timely payments to farmer members
It also became possible to reward quality at the factory level since payments could be
clearly identified with the source of the coffee Over a half a million coffee farmers and
90% of all coffee cooperative societies benefited from the project
6.   A total of 24 new factories were built, and 226 renovated under this scheme. The
project fell short of the appraisal targets (65 new and 275 rehabilitation) mainly due to a
downturn in overall production following the start-up of the project It was recognized
during 1993 that additional capacity was not immediately required and the project's
emphasis should be on factory renovations. A significant project activity, later also
supported by STABEX funds, was the electrification of existing factories, which has
reduced operating costs, reduced losses due to breakdowns, and has had the indirect but
significant developmental effect of providing electricity to remote villages, significantly
improving social welfare The positive environmental impact of the factory development
was substantial Each factory improvement under the project installed a system of full
water recirculation, pulping towers, and pollution control Some of the factories were
resited in order to comply with this requirement The development of five factory
models, which was painstakingly done in the early period of the project, paid off as these
designs are now the industry standard The amount of pollutants released into Kenya's
waterways decreased by 50% in factories with the new designs CRF training facilities
were strengthened by the project financing a new training facility and dormitory and



v
many field extension officers and farmers benefited from intensive field days organized
by the project.
7. The impact of the project has been mitigated as a result of events taking place
outside the scope of the project, Weather, international prices and domestic economic
policies have had an impact, however there has been a supply response from the
smallholder farmer. Farm incomes would certainly have been lower in the absence of the
farm inputs credit scheme but average yields have not increased over the period of the
project2. The project had a direct influence on farm incomes through the measures to
reduce industry overheads which resulted in a greater share of sale proceeds being passed
on to farmers. It is likely that the project contributed towards improving the quality of
Kenyan coffee over the project period. Coffee falling in the 7-10 class and mbuni3 had
reached 32%, up from 14% in earlier years. By 1994 the quality had improved
significantly showing that class 1-6 reached 75% (up from 68%) and classes 7-10 and
mbuni 25 %. From a sample often societies taken in 1998, quality had further increased
whereby the proportion in classes 1-6 had reached 80.3%, with 7-10 and mbuni 19.7%.
Due to the over all increase in quality, over the project period, Kenya was able to
maintain its position as a high quality producer in the coffee markets thus receiving a 14
to 15% bonus in price..
Major Factors Affecting the Project
8. The project had a fairly narrow focus on smallholder production and the aimed to
mitigate the constraints experienced by the coffee cooperative sector. However, the latter
years of project implementation were characterised by a negative industry environment.
Seasonal conditions and international prices had an impact on production and quality of
coffee over the life of the project. The collapse of the International Coffee Agreement
brought prices lower during 1991/92 and adverse weather conditions between 1992 and
1994, and again in 1997 and 1998, contributed to declines in production. Soon after
effectiveness of the project in late 1990, Kenya Planters Cooperative Union members
decided not to proceed with the investment in the expansion of their milling capacity by
50,000 tons. This had a major impact, causing the Commonwealth Development
Corporation to withdraw their cofinancing in the project. This meant that the project had
no mechanism to support the small estate subsector, a growing proportion of the coffee
producing farms in Kenya. The arrival of Thika Coffee Mills in the mid nineties gave the
farmers a choice of miller, however as production dropped, both mills were operating
well below capacity and the competition between the millers aggravated conflicts within
coffee cooperatives.
9. The implementation period of the project was concurrent with a mixed record of
liberalization of the Kenyan economy, as well as the introduction of multiparty
democracy. These changes in both the political system and the economy have created a
high level of uncertainty which has effected investment as well as production. The
project did not have specific policy conditionalities, however the liberalization of coffee
marketing did feature in the Bank's overall adjustment and sector policy dialog with the
govemment. While the full liberalisation of the coffee industry was proposed and has
been under discussion 1992, the final step of liberalising coffee marketing has not yet

taken place This delay has caused an erosion of fanner confidence and has resulted in a
destabilisation of the industry There remains no clear vision for the future structure of
the industry which identifies the roles of the many institutions involved, the marketing
systems, and the financing of the industry The absence of a clear vision of policy reform
and the way forward for the industry, farmers are exposed to differing views from various
vested interests. In addition, the desires of many coffee farmers to manage their own
affairs by splitting large coffee cooperatives into smaller units focused on factory
management have been thwarted by politics and mismanagement In some cases this has
resulted in violent confrontation There have been many cases, most notably Muranga,
where these splits have been done in an orderly fashion, with liquidation of assets and
liabilities and there is no technical reason why this cannot be the rule rather than the
exception All these factors have further contributed to uncertainty and division amongst
coffee growers and have had a negative effect on production.
Sustainability
10   Most of the activities initiated by SCIP II have been sustained following the closure
of the IDA Credit These include the Improved Payment System, coffee extension
activities, training programs from the Coffee Research Foundation The capacities of the
PCMI have been divided between the Ministries of Agriculture and Cooperative
Development, and will continue to support technical aspects of coffee production as well
as the organizational and management support to the cooperative sector, respectively In
addition, engineers trained and certified under the project will continue to serve the
industry within government as well as in the private sector The capacity of the
Cooperative Bank to serve the sector has been enhanced by the technical support
provided by the PCMU as well as by building up their own financial capacities
11   SCIP II made a significant contribution to financing the working capital of the
coffee industry. The Cooperative Bank has established revolving funds which are being
topped up with their own commercial funds and with EU STABEX funds. However, the
sustainability of the credit activities supported by SCIP II depends on issues surrounding
investment in the industry, including: (i) the overall financial viability and international
competitiveness of the industry (including macro-economic conditions), (ii) the financial
status of societies as regards overhead costs; (iii) the curTent under-utilisation of factory
capacity, (iv) the departure from the membership of societies of farmers with coffee
farms in excess of 5 acres (2 ha), and the unlawful sale of cherry to buyers outside the
societies, are having the impact of eroding the income base of the societies, (v) the
practice of "double hypothecation" of the coffee. All of these could affect the level of
investment in the sector as well as smallholder interest The lack of direction in the
industry has created tremendous instability at the cooperative level which has reversed
many of the gains made under the project. The Cooperative Bank is now faced with
delays in loan recovery due to the mismanaged process of society reorganisation and
splits which have been going on during the past few years This situation will have to
improve before we can be certain of any lasting impact of the credit schemes created
under the project
12   Delays in the liberalisation of coffee marketing have had a substantial negative
impact on the project Despite recent moves to increase transparency in the operations of
the Coffee Board of Kenya, uncertainties within the industry concerning the role of the
Board, and deregulation ofthe industry remain The industry continues to be subject to
political interference. Returns to the farmer have fallen and have resulted in decreasing



vii
production. Taking these external factors into account, the sustainability of the project is
rated as uncertain.
Bank and Borrower Performance
13.  The overall performance of the borrower is rated as satisfactory. A high degree of
borrower ownership of this project, particularly on the side of the MOCD and the Coop
Bank, contributed towards the successful implementation of individual components
However, whilst the Government was under no strict obligation to complete the process
of liberalization of the coffee sector under the terms of the project, the failure of
government to address these issues was a major factor in the project's outcome The
Government should have proactively taken action, for the benefit of the industry, the
farmers and the country, on the policy and institutional situation that was negatively
affecting confidence in the industry at the same time the project was addressing the
working capital, processing and technology training constraints
14  The performance of the Bank during preparation and appraisal are judged to be
satisfactory Key constraints were identified, and effectiveness conditions ensured that
necessary changes in the payment and credit system were in place before the project
began disbursing It should be noted that wider conditionalities concerning the
liberalisation of the subsector were not included As the liberalisation process proceeded
in fits and starts, and from the mid term review onwards, the Bank did make comments
and recommendations on coffee marketing and the restructuring of the cooperative sector
However, Bank performance during supervision is judged to be deficient as it should
have made more explicit links with overall cooperative and coffee subsector performance
and the implementation progress of specific project components
Project Outcome
15   The physical implementation of the main project components was satisfactory and
the project's objectives were supported by what progress that the Government made on
industry reform Benefits related to IPS at the farm level as well as on overall production
are likely to expand, as more societies will continue to adopt the system The expansion
of the training facilities at CRF is a success and provides a focus to training in the coffee
sector The coffee extension effort needs to be further strengthened for it to become a
more effective tool where farmers can turn to for advice There were circumstances
during project implementation, which resulted in the project not achieving its stated
objectives of increased incomes Some were beyond the control and influence of the
project, such as weather and weather and international markets The project satisfactorily
assisted in the improvement of payment systems and, whilst the project injected much
needed working capital, the impact of the credit schemes will depend on the future supply
response of farmers and the cost of funds required to maintain the flow of credit
However, the most striking features of the industry which remain following a long period
of Bank support are the negative influence and political control of the Coffee Board of
Kenya and the chaos and disarray found in many key coffee growing areas due to the
mismanagement of the cooperative restructuring process. Whilst there were positive
outcomes as a result of the project, these negative factors have impacted so significantly
on coffee production, the assessment of the overall outcome of the project is considered
unsatisfactory.

Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
Findings
16   The main finding from the implementation of SCIP II was that production
improvements that require investment and risk-taking by small farmers could be
jeopardized by uncertainty and lack of confidence in the industry in which they are
operating The project's interventions were well placed to address the financial and
production constraints of the industry, and were well implemented However, by not
fully addressing the total industry environment, the impact of the project's activities was
limited The conclusion drawn is that an agreed timetable of progress towards
liberalization of all aspects of the industry should have been part of SCIP II It should be
noted that, similar to reforms in other key sectors, the pace of reform in the agricultural
sector during the life of the project, even when specific milestones have been agreed with
Government, has been disappointing
Future Operations
17   The future operations of this project depend foremost on the will of the farmers to
continue to grow high quality coffee in an ever changing environment Coffee is
responsive to favorable management and good growing conditions and production can
quickly rise to former levels While individual cooperative societies improved their
financial accountability, and hence increased farmers' returns, greater effort will need to
be made to further improve management efficiency and transparency in order to build up
farmers' confidence At the farmer level, the relative input/output costs and returns from
coffee production will determine the future participation by farmers in the industry, and
the level of management and other inputs required In particular, this will determine the
overall demand for credit and the cost that the farmers can afford to pay for that credit
However, equally important for the future are the questions relating to increasing the
general level of confidence of all participants Clear statements on the Government's
vision for the future of the industry are urgently required, defining roles and rules.
Central to this is the redefinition of the role of the Coffee Board of Kenya, removing its
role as the sole marketing agent. In addition, in order for the industry to be
internationally competitive and sustainable, all the participants would need fair and
equitable returns for their investment in, and their contribution to, value added within the
production/processing/marketing chain of the industry
Key Lessons Learned
18.  The key lessons learned from this project can be summarized as follows
* Conditionalities were not included in the design of the project to address some of the
wider and possibly contentious policy issues facing the industry reformns today As
this was a major factor during implementation and affects sustainability of the
project, the project could have been implemented in conjunction with of a wider
process of industry reform specifically for the coffee sector agreed between the World
Bank and GOK However it is recognized that the political nature of these problems
could have preempted the entire project and sacrificed the chievements gained under



ix
the project at the producer and processing level These gains have established a base
upon which smaliholders can contribute to growth of the industry in the future
*  Delegation of project supervision to the World Bank team located in the field was
desirable for ensuring timely client service during project start-up, clearance of
bidding documents; processing of disbursement requests and implementation
adjustments to the project in response to the changing environment facing the coffee
industry However it may have reduced the scope for external comment on the
negative influences on project outcome.
*  After the withdrawal of the CDC financing, the project should have found a way to
support through financial and technical assistance the increasingly important small
estate sub sector. This component could possibly have gone forward had an
acceptable financial internediary been identified Only during the last year of the
project was a decision made to include these farmers in the Coop Bank lending
program
*  On revisiting the project risks at appraisal, it proved essential that the adoption of an
improved payment system was a condition of effectiveness.
*  It would have been of greater benefit to the coffee industry had the repayment period
for on-lent [DA funds been greater, permitting lower cost funds to remain in the
industry rather than being repaid to Government for the financing of general
Government activities This would have had the effect of sustaining the capital base
of the revolving funds for a longer period, thereby smoothing the transition to
commercial rates Adjustment of the repayment schedule could allow Cooperative
Bank to weather the current storm in the industry while continuing to serve the sector
and honour its obligations to the Government,

SECOND COFFEE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT (SCIP fI
(IDA Cr. 2062-KE)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
1   The main objective of SCIP II was to raise the incomes of smaliholder and small
estate coffee farmers and workers through increased productivity and quality
improvements Related objectives were to (i) increase the country's foreign exchange
earnings and help it maintain its position in the coffee market by raising quality, (ii)
strengthen the capacities of the key participating agencies
2   The project was the second Bank-assisted project for the coffee sector in Kenya,
following the Smallholder Coffee Improvement Project (SCIP I) which started in 1979
SCIP I had a narrow focus on factory reconstruction to improve coffee quality and,
following its closure, the industry still required external support Efficiency in both
subsectors suffered from lack of available working capital, and confidence of small
coffee growers was low, exacerbated by the fact that payments for coffee delivered were
irregular and delayed by as much as 18 months The second coffee project was much
wider in scope and was designed to include smallholders and the emerging small estates.
SCIP II included modifications introduced into its design from the lessons learned in the
first project These included improved factory and cooperative management, more
rigorous lending criteria, a greater emphasis on factory rehabilitation, a more focussed
farn inputs component and a more effective project management unit
3   The strategy to achieve the objectives of the project was to streamline the payment
systems between the Coffee Board of Kenya through the societies to members, inject
short-term working capital and medium-term investment capital into the industry, and to
strengthen the key institutions involved Smailholder farmners were to be directly assisted
through the introduction of improved payment systems for coffee sales, and three credit
schemes, operated by Coop Bank, for an advance payment for cherry delivery, farm
inputs, and factory development. This was to be financed from the IDA Credit, Coop
Bank and the cooperative societies Assistance to the small estates was to take the form of
a credit scheme for irrigation and field equipment, coffee processing facilities and farm
inputs The project also provided for financial assistance to the Kenya Planters
Cooperative Union (KPCU) to expand its milling capacity with a new facility at Dandora
Both of these components were to be parallel financed by Commonwealth Development
Corporation (CDC) To address the training requirements of the industry, financed under
the IDA Credit and GOK, the project was to expand the Coffee Research Foundation's
(CRF) training facilities and conduct training programs in coffee production and
processing, including training programs, for MOA extension staff A component was also
included to support a Technical Management Services Unit within KPCU for the small
estate sector



2
4.   The objectives and approach of the project were appropriate and well designed to
address the perceived constraints at the time However, the project did not address some
of the more contentious policy issues facing the industry relating to its institutional
structure and its marketing systems. The industry was highly centralized and controlled
by one major miller, KPCU, and the Coffee Board of Kenya The process of moving
forward with the liberalization of the industry was not addressed by the project but was
rather taken up in the broader dialogue on structural and agricultural sector reform
between the Bank and the Government during the project's life Bank support to the
coffee industry was not directly contingent on policy or structural reform Whilst some
initiatives were taken by Government during the project on liberalizing some sections of
the industry, the marketing structure of the industry became a major factor that negatively
influenced confidence in coffee production and therefore, the potential benefits of the
project This is an issue that needed (and still needs) to be addressed and this project lost
an opportunity to do so. However it is recognized that the political nature of these
problems could have preempted the entire project, which would have meant sacrificing
the achievements of the project The conclusion drawn is that an agreed timetable of
progress towards liberalization of all aspects of the industry should have been part of
SCIP II Similar to reforms in other key sectors, the pace of reform in the agricultural
sector during the life of the project, even when specific milestones have been agreed with
Government, has been disappointing.

6.   The achievements of the project objectives were mixed as a result of events taking
place outside the scope of the project Seasonal conditions and international market prices
varied greatly during the period 1990-1998, and consequently, so did foreign exchange
earnings and farm incomes. Coffee production dropped from 1989 to 1993 due to the
collapse of world market prices Production began to rise in 1993 as the project
components began to take effect, but the drouglit in 1996 and El Nino of 1997/98, as
well as institutional uncertanities began to reverse this trend Production levels for the
smallholders were influenced by adverse climatic factors (drought and the El Nino
phenomenon) and the general low confidence levels of farmers arising from uncertainty
in the industry It should however be noted that despite all these negative factors,
production returned to 70,000 MT in the 1998/99 production year, and production in
1999/2000 is expected to rise to 85,000 MT
7    The project had a direct influence on farm incomes through the measures to reduce
industry overheads The measures introduced to control costs of cooperative societies



3
resulted in a greater share of sale proceeds being passed on to farmers Cooperative
society factory operating costs reduced from an average of 40% to 30% in participating
societies over the period of the project The average proportion of the net payment
received by the societies from coffee sales (after deduction of statutory and marketing
charges) that is now passed on to the farmer rose to 69%, up from as low as' 55% before
the project started The introduction of improved payment systems and advance harvest
payments had a significant impact on the timing of the cash flow of farmers Overall,
whilst farm incomes did not increase in absolute terms, incomes were higher that they
would have been without the project, and therefore, the objective of increased incomes
and returns was partially achieved Over a half a million farmers and 90% of all coffee
cooperative societies benefited from the project
8    One of the objectives of the project was to improve smallholder coffee quality,
which was at an all time low during project preparation Coffee falling in the 7-10 class
and mbuni4 had reached 32%, up from 14% in earlier years By 1994 the quality had
improved significantly showing that class 1-6 reached 75% (up from 68%) and classes 7-
10 and mbuni 25 %. From a sample of ten.societies taken in 1998, quality had further
increased whereby the proportion in classes 1-6 had reached 80 3%, with 7-10 and mbuni
19 7% It is likely that the project contributed towards improving quality, but it is
difficult to quantify this due to the many factors that influence quality, both external to
the project as well as factors that the project was addressing Due to the over all increase
in quality, over the project period, Kenya was able to maintain its position as a high
quality producer in the coffee markets thus receiving a 14 to 15% bonus in price.

9    The project had a direct influence on farm incomes through the availability of low-
interest credit for farm inputs and through measures to reduce industry overheads The
extent of the impact of the farm input scheme is difficult to quantify since no specific
beneficiary assessment was conducted Farm incomes would certainly have been lower in
the absence of the farm inputs credit scheme but yields generally fell over the period of
the project However, the official yield figures are based on recorded areas and, whilst the
area under coffee reduced, this is not reflected in the area under production since it is
unlawful to uproot coffee trees There is strong evidence that area under coffee has
reduced, as some estates and plantations have uprooted coffee to plant flowers, and many
of the land buying companies in Thika and Kiambu have subdivided large areas for
residential plots Therefore, the diagram represents a combination of reduced yields and
reduced farmer participation in the industry and should be treated as inconclusive due to
the severe overestimation of area under production

10  The strengthening of the key institutions directly involved in the project was an
other objective of the project This objective was substantially achieved with the main
beneficiaries being the Coop Bank, the Project Coordination and Management (PCMU)
staff, the Coffee Research Foundation, and both the Ministries of Agriculture (MOA) and
of Cooperative Development (MOCD).
C. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE
PROJECT
General
I 1   The project was approved in September 1989 but became effective only in August
1990. This delay resulted mainly from the time taken to introduce the improved payment
system, which was a condition of effectiveness. The start-up process was slow because of
the preparations required in advance of the launch of the credit schemes, particularly the
technical design and appraisal work required for the factory development On the ground
activities started in 1993 A mid-term review was undertaken in February 1995 The
original closing date of June 30, 1997 was extended to enable the factory renovation
program to be completed, and the Credit closed on June 30, 1998 A total of SDR 32 6
million of the SDR 36.5 million was disbursed (89%) Due to variations in SDR/US$
exchange rates, an amount equivalent to US$45 8 million was disbursed, whilst the
original principal was equivalent to US$51 million
12  The main activities of the project centered around changing the methods of
financing the working capital of the coffee industry, upgrading factory capacity and
facilities, and capacity building, as detailed below
Improved Payment Scheme and Cherry Advance Payment Scheme
1 3  As a condition of effectiveness, the project was instrumental in introducing an
Improved Payment System (IPS) for coffee producers This system provided for a
prompt and direct payment mechanism for coffee sales to significantly reduce the
payment time lag that previously was a factor that curbed farmer interest in growing
coffee Inherent in the scheme were initiatives to control operating costs of the societies.
The scheme involved the establishment of two accounts for each society, a members
payment account and a society operation expenses account Reviews of society operating
expenses were undertaken to reduce costs and to determine the proportion of sales value
to be allocated to farmers accounts and to society operations accounts Over the period of
the project, the proportion of cooperative revenues that is paid to farmers increased from
around 60% to an average of 69%, and in some of the societies with strong financial
management, is now as high as 85% Following the introduction of the IPS, two other
policy changes were implemented that impacted on the payments systems In 1992,
coffee sales were permitted to be conducted in US dollars and exchanged at market rates,
thereby removing the implicit export tax that was depressing the farmers' share of export
revenues from coffee production. In addition, the introduction of "outside the pool" sales
permitted the proceeds of individual sales to be paid directly to the society delivering the
coffee, thereby eliminating delays in payment that were previously experienced by
pooling all sales To further improve the cash flow of coffee fanners, the cherry advance
payment scheme (CAPS) was introduced to provide an advance payment at harvest for



5
cherry delivered to cooperative society factories This was financed by the Coop Bank
through on lending initially of the IDA Credit and subsequently, STABEX funds to
societies, and then to members
14.  These changes had a positive impact on the timing of payments to farmers. The
CAPS scheme gave farmers a cash payment following the delivery of cherry To respond
to farmers' wishes and to simplify administration, the CAPS payments were generally
made in the January following the main harvest period of October to December The
period of receiving the first payment after delivery of cherry was thereby reduced to less
than around 2 months as opposed to about 12-13 months before the project The IPS, in
conjunction with the introduction of outside-the-pool payments, significantly improved
the cash flow of societies, enabling more timely payments to farmer members It also
became possible to reward quality at the factory level since payments could be clearly
identified with the source of the coffee Currently, payments are received by the societies
within 14 days from the date of auction, but there remain delays in final payments to
farmers since societies in practice wait until the bulk of production has been sold before
final payments are made The timing varies widely depending on the society, but now
generally the effective total time elapsed between harvest and final payment is between
six and nine months, compared with up to I 8 months before the project
1 5 A total of 214 societies now participate in this scheme and, whilst the estates do not
benefit from the CAPS program, some 61 estates did benefit from the IPS As seasonal
credit, the CAPS funds are maintained in Coop Bank as a revolving fund comprising both
IDA and STABEX funds. IDA funds were on-lent to Coop Bank at 8% interest rate, then
on to societies at 13%, and finally to members at 15%. Societies had to repay within one
year. With this structure, the financial advantage of the IDA Credit terms to the ultimate
beneficiaries, the coffee farmers, was limited Therefore, to sustain the capital base of the
revolving fund, commercial funds will have to be injected A total of approximately KSh
908 million (US$ 15 1 million) was disbursed This component was satisfactory
Farm Input Loan Scheme (FILS)
16. Farm Input Loan Scheme FILS was designed to provide affordable credit terms for
farm inputs, crucial to production and quality, in a general environment of high
commercial interest rates The Coop Bank was operating Cooperative Production Credit
Schemes (CPCSs) and the new injection of funds under the project was to provide
incremental credit to increase the use of inputs over existing levels that were judged to be
sub-optimal
17   FILS assisted in enabling the continued use of inputs in times of reduced margins
and incomes, but levels of use did not rise to optimal levels as envisaged. At a time of
poor climatic conditions and uncertainty in the industry, it is likely that inputs were
diverted to other crops FILS credit was available at interest rates of 1 5% compared with
market rates which varied over the course of the project, but in general remained higher
In practice, FILS effectively replaced rather than supplemented CPCS, as societies were
unwilling or unable to borrow at commercial rates There was a high demand for FILS
funds and the IDA funding for this component was complemented by STABEX The total
IDA credit provided under this scheme was US$ 13 million as against an appraisal
estimate of US$ 7 million The project introduced procurement procedures to be adopted
by societies that were subject to greater openness and competitive bidding. This initiative



6
also reduced possible negative environmental impacts of chemical use by stipulating
approved chemicals only5
18   The IDA funds for FILS were onlent to the Coop Bank to establish a revolving
fund A similar interest rate structure as for CAPS applied These funds, howvever, were
repayable to the Government over a period of two years with a one-year grace period
This meant that, for the FILS revolving fund to maintain its capital base, additional IDA
disbursements were required and, following the closure of the credit, funds from
commercial sources will be required The use of commercial funds by Coop Bank for
continuing FILS will increase the underlying interest rate of the revolving fund
However, commercial rates are now below 20% so this should not pose a major
difficulty The repayment terms resulted in IDA funds being available for the benefit of
the coffee industry for a relatively short period of time and then reverted to the general
financing requirement of the Government
Factory Development Loan Scheme (FDLS)
19.  A total of 24 new factories were built, and 226 renovated under this scheme at a
cost of approximately KSh 710 million (US$ 11 8 million). The project fell short of the
appraisal targets (65 new and 275 rehabilitation) mainly due to a downturn in overall
production following the start-up of the project It was recognized during 1993 that
additional capacity was not immediately required and the project's emphasis should be on
factory renovations The project supported both new factories and additional capacity in
renovated factories whereby, at the end of the project with production levels down, the
cooperative subsector has factory capacity that is presently under-utilized, estimated to be
56% capacity utilisation based on the 1997/98 production levels This has increased
financial overheads of the societies due to debt service obligations A significant project
activity, later also supported by STABEX funds, was the electrification of existing
factories, which has reduced operating costs, reduced losses due to breakdowns, and has
had the indirect but significant developmental effect of providing electricity for other
purposes in more remote locations. The positive environmental impact of the factory
development was substantial. Each factory improvement under the project installed a
system of full water recirculation, pulping towers, and pollution control Some of the
factories were resited in order to comply with this requirement The development of five
factory models, which was painstakingly done in the early period of the project, paid off
as these designs are now the industry standard Overall, this component was satisfactory
Training and Institutional Strengthening
20   One of the project objectives was to strengthen the capacities of institutions
involved in the coffee industry with special emphasis on those involved in project
implementation The main beneficiaries of this activity were the Coop Bank, the PCMU,
the Coffee Research Foundation (CRF), and the Ministries of Cooperatives and of
Agriculture
21   The Coop Bank was the main institution responsible for the three credit

components, and it proved to be an effective lending institution for its clients in the
coffee industry. The Coop Bank adopted sound accounting principles and practices, and
revised and improved procurement procedures With the help of PCMU, the Coop Bank
built up its capacity to review and evaluate proposals for possible financing
22   The day-to-day execution of the project components was the responsibility of the
PCMU Lessons learned from SCIP I were incorporated in the operational aspects of
operating the PCMU. It was able to operate as a semi-autonomous unit It was composed
of highly qualified competent and motivated staff Consequently, it became an efficient
management unit contributing greatly to the smooth implementation success of this
project
23   CRF training facilities were strengthened by the project financing a new training
facility and dormitory, which became operational only in July 1997 following a number
of construction delays Since its opening, 233 coffee factory managers and engineers
from 17 districts were trained, and 51 extension officers from the central province
received training Many field extension officers benefited from intensive field days
organized by the project. In fact direct field activity by Coop Bank, PCMU, KPCU, CBK
and CRF had a substantial impact as compared to project funds which supported coffee
extension in the context of a relatively weak national extension system
24   The training component was generally satisfactory, with the possible exception of
training of the coffee extension field officers. At appraisal, it was observed that extension
staff concentrated their field activities on food crops at the expense of giving advice on
coffee production and tree management At the conclusion of the project, field
observations showed no significant change of emphasis in spite of the project's support to
extension staff training and mobility SCIP support to the national extension system must
be seen in the context of the weaknesses of the system (see the ICR for the Second
National Extension Project, Cr 2199-KE).
Project Costs and Financing
25   The actual cost of the project was US$ 68 2 million as against an appraisal target of
US$ 106 8 million The difference can be accounted for by the fact that the proposed
KPCU coffee mill and the component for assistance to the small estate sub-sector did not
proceed (estimated costs US$29 3 million) due to CDC's withdrawal from the project (see
paragraph 0) In addition, the factory rehabilitation component was not as extensive as
anticipated and a significant depreciation of the Kenya Shilling occurred during
implementation
26   The project afforded an opportunity for the application of STABEX funds for the
benefit of the coffee industry By the close of the project, an amount of US$ II million
had been provided, of which US$ 102 went to supplement the CAPS and FIlLS credit
schemes STABEX funds were also used to support factory electrification and some
training
Economic and Social Impact
27   The production benefits derive mainly from supply response from the prompt
payment and increasing percentage of gross proceeds getting to the farmer The use of



8
agricultural inputs and improved management on existing plantations had a negligible
impact on the expansion of the area planted to Ruiru 11 The estate sub-sector can be
excluded from the analysis as the project did not assist this category The approach of the
analysis was to recalculate the values of the investment costs actually incurred, and then
to estimate the net economic benefits of certain levels of production that would render an
acceptable ERR, and then to make a judgement of the likelihood of such an outcome
28   The reworked analysis indicates that if the project can claim to have achieved an
incremental, sustainable production level of 2,300 tons p a. from existing smallholder
coffee plantations, then the ERR for the project would be 12%, a satisfactory outcome. It
is considered likely that, without the project, production would have fallen to levels lower
than 2,300 tons below achieved and expected future production levels Given the
availability of low-cost credit and the initiatives which changed capital flows to farmers
the project encouraged coffee production The conclusion drawn is that the project had a
satisfactory outcome in terms of its economic impact
29   All cooperative societies participating in the project were required to include both
husband and wife in the coffee payment pass-book, which had a major impact on family
income, as the wife needed to be present on payment days This has resulted in a larger
proportion of coffee proceeds being used for family welfare There is also evidence that
the timing of CAPS payments, which coincide with school fees payment, has increased
school enrollment in participating farm areas The improved payment system has also
made more credit available to farm families as coffee production is seen as a secure
collateral for loans
Major Factors Affecting the Project
30   The project was well designed to address constraints to production and quality that
were in evidence at the time of appraisal It was implemented largely as perceived at
appraisal, although the scope was somewhat reduced The project was working in an
industry environment in which many major factors had direct impacts on the level of
achievement of its objectives These were as follows
31   Seasonal Growing Conditions anid International Prices During the 198 Os, coffee
production in Kenya showed a steady growth to about 120,000 tons in 1988 Based on
this growth, the Government predicted an annual growth of about 8% giving a production
estimate of 3 50,000 tons by the year 2004 World Bank estimates of growth during
appraisal of SCIP II was a modest 1 5% per annum, taking into account the financial and
marketing problems facing the industry Growth in the cooperative sector was estimated
at an incremental yield of 18,000 tons over a 7-year period due to SCIP II project
activities
32   Seasonal conditions and international prices had an impact on production and
quality of coffee over the life of the project The collapse of the International Coffee
Agreement brought prices lower during 1991/2 Drought in 1992 and two subsequent
seasons contributed to declines in production from levels averaging more than 110,000
tons annually during 1985 to 1990 to 75,000 tons. In the cooperatives sector, coffee
production showed a dramatic reduction from about 80,000 tons in 1988 to 40,000 tons in
1993, before project activities began in earnest Whilst weather certainly played a major
factor in this decline, weather alone was not the only negative factor International coffee



9
prices fell and a number of policy changes announced in 1992 had the effect of creating
some uncertainty, particularly on the part of smallholders However, with the weather
improving in 1994 and the full implementation of SCIP II, production in the cooperatives
sector improved to about 60,000 tons in 1994 and 1995, with the crop benefiting from
higher international coffee prices. The crop was again adversely affected by the weather
because of continued rains during October/November 1997 resulting in a total production
forecast of 60,000 tons for 1998 with the cooperatives sector contributing approximately
35,000 tons.
33.  Coffee Milling Soon after effectiveness of the project in late 1990, KPCU members
decided not to proceed with the investment in the expansion of their milling capacity by
50,000 tons This had a major impact on the participation of CDC in cofinancing the
project, which subsequently decided not to participate The effect on the industry was
twofold (i) on the negative side this meant that the small estate subsector was left
unassisted by SCIP II (see below) thereby neglecting a significant section of the coffee
producing farms in Kenya; (ii) on the positive side, following partial liberalization of the
industry (see below) the private sector started to invest in milling facilities to compete
directly with KPCU for provision of these services Whilst the longer term impact is
expected to be positive, this move has led to divisions within the cooperative sector and is
cited as a major factor prompting the split of societies into smaller units, dependent on
the miller chosen by the society The arrival of Thika Coffee Mills in the mid nineties
gave the farmers a choice of miller, however as production dropped, both mills were
operating well below capacity and the competition between the millers aggravated
conflicts within coffee cooperatives
34.  Smallt Esate suhsector. To be co-financed by CDC, this subsector was to have
received support by the project through the provision of credit for factory investments,
irrigation, seasonal inputs, and training This component did not proceed due to CDC's
withdrawal from the project. This component could possibly have gone forward had an
acceptable financial intermediary been identified Only during the last year of the project
was a decision made to include these farmners in the Coop Bank lending program
35   The importance of this subsector is highlighted by the fact that of the more than
1,100 registered estates in 1989, about 750 were classified as small estates (between 4
and 20 ha accounting for 5000 ha in total) During the life of the project, the definition of
small estates was broadened to include farms between 2 and 20 ha This meant a rise in
numbers in 1998 to 1,600 representing an estimated 7,000 ha These estates are now also
eligible to have their own small factory. Most of these growers are financially weak and
have no access to credit for investments and farm inputs, and hence their performance is
poor
36   Coffee Indcustry Liberalisation: The implementation period of the project was
concurrent with a mixed record of liberalisation of the Kenyan economy, as well as the
introduction of multiparty democracy. These changes in both the political system and the
economy have created a high level of uncertainty which has effected investment as well
as production. The project did not have specific policy conditionalities, however the
liberalisation of coffee marketing did feature in the Bank's overall adjustment and sector
policy dialog with the government As regards the coffee industry, measures announced
in October 1992 signalled the start of the reforn process These involved (i) the conduct



10
of coffee sales in US dollars and exchanged at market rates, (ii) the licensing of private
sector millers, (iii) the introduction of "outside the pool" payments While the full
liberalisation of the coffee industry was proposed and has been under discussion since
1992, the final step of liberalising coffee marketing has not yet taken place This delay
has caused an erosion of farmer confidence and has resulted in a destabilisation of the
industry There remains no clear vision for the future structure of the industry which
identifies the roles of the many institutions involved, the marketing systems, and the
financing of the industry The absence of a clear vision of policy reforn and the way
forward for the industry, farmers are exposed to differing views from various vested
interests In addition, the desires of many coffee farmers to manage their own affairs by
splitting large coffee cooperatives into smaller units focused on factory management have
been thwarted by politics and mismanagement. In some cases this has resulted in violent
confrontation There have been many cases, most notably Muranga, where these splits
have been done in an orderly fashion, with liquidation of assets and liabilities and there is
no technical reason why this cannot be the rule rather than the exception All these
factors have further contributed to uncertainty and division amongst coffee growers and
have had a negative effect on production
37   On revisiting the project risks at appraisal, it proved essential that the adoption of
an improved payment system was a condition of effectiveness Technical risks were
minimized through the appointment of high caliber management Maintaining the staff
was ensured by the project through topping up of Government salaries The external risk
of the International Coffee Organization coffee quota system not being reintroduced
proved to be a major factor in the decline of coffee production during the project period
Other external risks related to reforms of the industry were not envisaged during
appraisal
D. SUSTAINABILITY
38.  It was envisaged that the project appraisal capacity of the PCMU would be
incorporated into another agency at the end of the project Most of the key staff
underwent technical training and gained a great deal of experience during the life of the
project In addition to opportunities in the private sector, both the Ministries of
Agriculture and of Cooperatives will continue to use the expertise in coffee extension,
monitoring and evaluation When the project closed, the capacities of the PCMU were
been divided between the Ministries of Agriculture and Cooperative Development, and
will continue to support technical aspects of coffee production as well as the
organizational and management support to the cooperative sector, respectively In
addition, engineers trained and certified under the project will continue to serve the
industry within government as well as in the private sector The capacity of the
Cooperative Bank to serve the sector has been enhanced by the technical support
provided by the PCMU as well as by building up their own financial capacities
39   The establishment of a Steering Committee, which included the Coffee Board,
KPCU, and other stakeholders, was positive step in providing a forum for coordination
and discussion of issues relevant to the project and to the industry The continuation of
this Committee would be valuable as a future place for discussion and resolution of future
issues in the industry
40.  The coffee extension activities under the Ministry of Agriculture will continue and



it
it is expected that cost-effective extension methods employed by the project - radio,
coffee field days, and barazas - will continue As already evidenced, other groups,
including the private sector, are involved in advising farmers, and are becoming more
widespread Through the strengthening of the training facilities at CRF, training in all
aspects of coffee production, processing and marketing is likely to continue, through
support from levies and charges for training courses. These facilities will also be the
forum to pass on up-to-date information and new developments in coffee crop production
and processing
41   The IPS scheme is now very much part of the industry and it is considered that any
future restructuring would maintain this system
42   SCIP 1I made a significant contribution to financing the working capital of the
coffee industry This impact was larger than expected due to the application of funds
under STABEX to the CAPS, FILS and FDLS programs The sustainability of the credit
supported by SCIP II depends on issues surrounding the future of the credit component
Coop Bank now has a portfolio of SCIP II lending to the Cooperative sector amounting to
approximately KSh 1,200 million, representing around 10% of its total lending portfolio
In order to make ajudgement on the sustainability of the credit component, there are
many relevant factors that need to be considered including
* the overall financial viability and international competitiveness of the industry
(including macro-economic conditions) - interest rates remain high in Kenya, current
producer margins are low and the longer-term price outlook for coffee is flat
*  the financial status of societies as regards overhead costs - societies need to
continually adjust to changing business conditions and review costs There is a
current practice of societies splitting into smaller societies, with the number of
factories comprising a society, and hence income base, falling This is having an
impact of increasing total overheads within the cooperatives, a cost that the industry
may not be able to bear. This may signal a move towards restructuring some
cooperatives to private or share companies, focusing on the factory level
*  the current under-utilisation of factory capacity - with production levels forecast of
40,000 tons for 1998/99, factory capacity utilisation will be less than 50% For
factories with debt resulting from investment in rehabilitation, this will cause
financial strains for this year at least. However, production can jump sharply year-
on-year depending on seasonal conditions and input use Therefore, under-utilisation
could be a temporary condition.
*  the departure from the membership of societies of farmers with coffee farms in excess
of 5 acres (2 ha) - under new regulations, coffee fanners with more that 5 acres can
register independently and sell coffee outside the cooperatives sector This is having
the impact of eroding the income base of the societies. The practice of other
smallholder coffee growers, members of societies, unlawfully selling cherry to buyers
outside their societies is also negatively affecting the financial status of the societies
Again, new ownership and management structures for coffee factories may need to be
explored



12
the practice of "double hypothecation" of the coffee - there are proposals for a new
financial intermediary, a "coffee bank", established by the Coffee Board of Kenya to
finance the working capital of the societies Caution needs to be exercised to ensure
that loans from more than one financing source are not secured on the same
production
43   All of these could have the effect of increasing the risk of default on this debt, and
future uncertainties in the SCIP II portfolio is expected to be a matter of concern for
Coop Bank The issue of writing-off of bad or doubtful debts, contained in provisions in
the subsidiary loan agreement between GOK and Coop Bank, was raised during the final
supervision of the project. In addition, these factors could affect the level of investment
in the sector as well as smallholder interest The lack of direction in the industry has
created tremendous instability at the cooperative level which has reversed many of the
gains made under the project The Cooperative Bank is now faced with delays in loan
recovery due to the mismanaged process of society reorganisation and splits which have
been going on during the past few years This situation will have to improve before we
can be certain of any lasting impact of the credit schemes created under the project
44   Delays in the liberalisation of coffee marketing have had a substantial negative
impact on the project Despite recent moves to increase transparency in the operations of
the Coffee Board of Kenya, uncertainties within the industry concerning the role of the
Board, and deregulation of the industry remain The industry continues to be subject to
political interference Returns to the farmer have fallen and have resulted in decreasing
production Taking these external factors into account, the sustainability of the project is
rated as uncertain
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
45   The performance of the Bank during preparation and appraisal are judged to be
satisfactory. Key constraints were identified, and effectiveness conditions ensured that
necessary changes in the payment and credit system were in place before the project
began disbursing It should be noted that wider conditionalities concerning the
liberalisation of the subsector were not included. The Resident mission played an
important role in the successful implementation of the project Bank staff located at the
mission were fully responsible for appraisal and later for project supervision This
introduced a more pragmatic approach in project implementation and a greater
responsiveness towards the needs of the borrower and project staff, and assisted in
resolving procurement and disbursement matters Supervision was intensive at the
beginning of the project but less frequent at later stages due to Bank budget constraints
and the confidence in the substantial capacities of the PCMU Supervision missions paid
particular emphasis on organization and management, disbursement, procurement and
financial matters, and, while these are important, less attention was given during
supervision to the technical production issues facing the coffee farmer The Bank should
have been more flexible and responsive, during implementation, towards the needs of the
important small estate sub-sector that was left unassisted after the withdrawal of CDC co-
financing. As the liberalisation process proceeded in fits and starts, and from the mid
term review onwards, the Bank did make comments and recommendations on coffee
marketing and the restructuring of the cooperative sector However, Bank performance
during supervision is judged to be deficient as it should have made more explicit links
witlh overall cooperative and coffee subsector performance and the implementation

progress of specific project components.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
46   A high degree of borrower ownership of this project, particularly on the side of the
MOCD and the Coop Bank, contributed towards the successful implementation of
individual components The appointment of high caliber PCMU staff who were able to
work with a certain degree of autonomy also contributed towards smooth implementation
of the project. Procurement and accounting procedures by the PCMU and the Coop Bank
were generally carried out in accordance with applicable guidelines Preparation of
design work and evaluation of individual coffee factory investment proposals was carried
out satisfactorily In general, there was compliance with DCA covenants, and sufficient
budgetary allocations from Government sources to enable smooth implementation
However, whilst the Government was under no strict obligation to complete the process
of liberalisation of the coffee sector under the terms of the project, the failure of
government to address these issues was a major factor in the project's outcome The
Government should have proactively taken action, for the benefit of the industry, the
farmers and the country, on the policy and institutional situation that was negatively
affecting confidence in the industry at the same time the project was addressing the
working capital, processing and technology training constraints
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
47   The physical implementation of the main project components was satisfactory and
the project's objectives were supported by what progress that the Government made on
industry reform Benefits related to IPS at the farm level as well as on overall production
are likely to expand, as more societies will continue to adopt the system The expansion
of the training facilities at CRF is a success and provides a focus to training in the coffee
sector The coffee extension effort needs to be further strengthened for it to become a
more effective tool where farmers can turn to for advice There were circumstances
during project implementation, which resulted in the project not achieving its stated
objectives of increased incomes. Some were beyond the control and influence of the
project, such as weather and weather and international markets. The project satisfactorily
assisted in the improvement of payment systems and, whilst the project injected much
needed working capital, the impact of the credit schemes will depend on the future supply
response of farmers and the cost of funds required to maintain the flow of credit
However, the most striking features of the industry which remain following a long period
of Bank support are the negative influence and political control of the Coffee Board of
Kenya and the chaos and disarray found in many key coffee growing areas due to the
mismanagement of the cooperative restructuring process. Whilst there were positive
outcomes as a result of the project, these negative factors have impacted so significantly
on coffee production, the assessment of the overall outcome of the project is considered
unsatisfactory
H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
48   The future operations of this project depend foremost on the will of the farmers to
continue to grow high quality coffee in an ever changing environment Coffee is
responsive to favourable management and good growing conditions and production can
quickly rise to former levels



14
49   While individual cooperative societies improved their financial accountability, and
hence increased farmers' returns, greater effort could be made to further improve
management efficiency and transparency in order to build up farmers' confidence in the
cooperative movement, rather than splitting up of societies into non-viable small units
However, change may be inevitable and factories may become individualized and end up
operating as small businesses, owned by groups of farmers or individuals
50   At the farmer level, the relative input/output costs and returns from coffee
production will deternine the future participation by farmers in the industry, and the level
of management and other inputs required. In particular, this will determine the overall
demand for credit and the cost that the farmers can afford to pay for that credit With the
repayment of IDA advances for the credit schemes, particularly for CAPS and FILS, and
the resulting necessity for Coop Bank to use its own funds for this lending, the cost of
borrowing must progressively shift to commercial rates.
5 1  However, equally important for the future are the questions relating to increasing
the general level of confidence in all participants Clear statements on the Government's
vision for the future of the industry are urgently required, defining roles and rules
Central to this is the redefinition of the role of the Coffee Board of Kenya, removing its
role as the sole marketing agent In addition, in order for the industry to be
internationally competitive and sustainable, all the participants would need fair and
equitable returns for their investment in, and their contribution to, value added within the
production/processing/marketing chain of the industry
1. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
52   The key lessons learned from this project can be summarized as follows
*  Conditionalities were not included in the design of the project to address some of the
wider and possibly contentious policy issues facing the industry reforms today As
this was a major factor during implementation and affects sustainability of the
project, the project could have been implemented in conjunction with of a wider
process of industry reform specifically for the coffee sector agreed between the World
Bank and GOK However it is recognised that the political nature of these problems
could have pre-empted the entire project and sacrificed the achievements gained
under the project at the producer and processing level These gains have established a
base upon which smallholders can contribute to growth of the industry in the future
*  Delegation of project supervision to the World Bank team located in the field was
desirable for ensuring timely client service during project start-up, clearance of
bidding documents; processing of disbursement requests and implementation
adjustments to the project in response to the changing environment facing the coffee
industry However it may have reduced the scope for external comment on the
negative influences on project outcome
*  After the withdrawal of the CDC financing, the project should have found a way to
support through financial and technical assistance the increasingly important small
estate sub sector This component could possibly have gone forward had an



15
acceptable financial intermnediary been identified Only during the last year of the
project was a decision made to include these farmers in the Coop Bank lending
program
* On revisiting the project risks at appraisal, it proved essential that the adoption of an
improved payment system was a condition of effectiveness
* It would have been of greater benefit to the coffee industry had the repayment period
for on-lent IDA funds been greater, permitting lower cost funds to remain in the
industry rather than being repaid to Government for the financing of general
Government activities This would have had the effect of sustaining the capital base
of the revolving funds for a longer period, thereby smoothing the transition to
commercial rates Adjustment of the repayment schedule could allow Cooperative
Bank to weather the current storm in the industry while continuing to serve the sector
and honour its obligations to the Government

Table 9: Economic Costs and Benefits
The SAR presented an economic analysis that argued that the investments to be made
in factory development, capacity building and farmer education, coupled with initiatives to
improve the working capital availability to farmers, would result in higher quality and
incremental production. This would result firstly from the application of agricultural inputs
up to an optimum level and the establishment of improved varieties, and secondly from
improvements in quality resulting from better factory operations. The analysis envisaged
incremental production of around 19,000 tons of coffee would be attributable to the project.
For the cooperative sector, the analysis estimated that production would rise from 65,000
tons to 83,000 tons. The analysis estimated that an economic rate of r eturn of 29% would be
achieved under conditions in which the ICO quotas would not be reinstated. The analysis
included the full cost of the CAPS component of the improved payment system in the
economic cost streams incorrectly since this component was a method of short-term
financing of working capital and represents a transfer payment. The recalculated rate of
r eturn excluding these costs is 41 I%.

The piroject was prepared under price levels for international coffee quite different
from those experienced during the project, and different again from the current long-term
price outlook. In the economic analysis at appraisal, long-term international prices of
around US$ 3.00 per kg were used to value the production benefits. Coffee prices rose to
US$ 3.85/kg in 1997, but since have fallen sharply. The Bank's price outlook for coffee is for
prices to fall to US$ 1.88 in 2005. Therefore, the value of future incremental production in
the longer term is significantly less than that anticipated at appraisal.
The benefits from factory investment were to come from better design and reliability
of equipment that previously were contributing to processing delays and deterioration of
quality during the delays. However, with overall production levels down to half those at
appraisal, the capacity pressure on the factories has also reduced and it possible that this
factor has in itself led to quality levels higher that those experienced during the high
production era of the late 1980's. However, factory redesign and r e-equipping has a future
potential benefit in that the cooperative sector has the processing capacity to effectively deal
with double the current levels of production. There are in addition the environmental
benefits that have and will derive from the re-siting of factories and the provision of
pollution control facilities.
As mentioned in the main text, Kenya's coffee production fell during the project,
from 120,000 tons in 1988 to 60,000 tons in 1998, with the cooperative sector falling to
35,000 tons. The absence of an evaluation of the project's impact on farmer beneficiaries
means that the identification of the project's impact on overall production is not possible. It
is likely that the presence of the improved payment system and the input credit scheme



23
would have had a positive impact on production and, in order to determine whether the
project had a satisfactory economic impact, the question to be resolved is to what extent
would production have further fallen in the absence of the project.
The production benefits derive mainly from the use of agricultural inputs and
improved management on existing plantations as the project had a negligible impact on the
expansion of the area planted to Ruiru 11. The estate sub-sector can be excluded from the
analysis, as the project did not assist this category. The approach of the analysis was to
recalculate the values of the investment costs actually incurred, and then to estimate the net
economic benefits of certain levels of production that would render an acceptable ERR, and
then to make a judgement of the likelihood of such an outcome.
The reworked analysis indicates that if the project can claim to have achieved an
incremental, sustainable production level of 2,300 tons p.a. from existing plantations in the
cooperative sector, then the ERR for the project would be 12%Yo, a satisfactory outcome. It is
considered likely that production would have fallen to levels lower than 2,300 tons below
achieved and expected future production levels, given the availability of low-cost credit and
the initiatives for changing working capital flows under the project, and their flow-on
encouragement for coffee production. The conclusion drawn is that the project had a
satisfactory outcome in terms of its economic impact.

SECOND COFFEE IMPROVEMIENT PROJECT (SCIP II)
(IDA Cr. 2062-KE)
APPENDIX A
AIDE-MEMOIRE
A. INTRODUCTION
I
A mission6 from the FAO Investment Center visited Kenya from 5th to 16th October
1998 to prepare the Implementation Completion Report for the Second Coffee
Improvement Project (SCIP II) under the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program.
The mission worked closely with staff of the SCIP II Project Management Unit and
held discussions with World Bank and Government of Kenya officials associated with
the project, including those responsible for the implementation of the project in the
Ministries of Cooperative Development (MOCD), and of Agriculture and Livestock
Development (MOALD). The mission had discussions with officials and staff of the
Cooperative Bank of Kenya (Coop Bank), Kenya Planters Cooperative Union (KPCU),
Coffee Board of Kenya (CBK), and private millers. The mission visited coffee factories
in Machakos and Nyeri districts and had discussions with cooperative society officials
and farmers.
2.  A wrap-up discussion was held on 15thOctober, chaired by the Permanent Secretary,
Ministry of Cooperative Development, with staff from the various Government
agencies that had been involved in the implementation of the project. This aide-
memoire is a record of the missions initial findings and conclusions.
2.  The mission would like to record its appreciation for the cooperation and assistance
shown by all officers and staff of the Government with whom the mission has been
working.
B. BACKGROUND
4   The project was the second Bank-assisted project for the coffee sector in Kenya,
starting with Smallholder Coffee Improvement Project (SCIP) in 1979. The main
objective of SCIP II was to raise the incomes of coffee farmers and workers in the

smallholder subsector through increased productivity and quality improvements.
Related objectives were to: (i) increase the country's foreign exchange earnings and
help it maintain its position in the coffee market by raising quality; (ii) strengthen the
capacities of the key participating agencies. SCIP II was similar in concept to SCIP I
with modifications introduced into its design from the lessons learned in the first
project. These included improved factory and cooperative management, more rigorous
lending criteria, a greater emphasis on factory rehabilitation, a more focussed farm
inputs component and a more effective project management unit.
5   The cooperative subsector was to be directly assisted through the introduction of
improved payment systems for coffee sales, and three credit schemes, operated by
Coop Bank, for an advance payment for cherry delivery, farm inputs, and factory
development. This was to be financed from the IDA credit, Coop Bank and the
cooperative societies. Assistance to the estate subsector was to take the form of a credit
scheme for irrigation and field equipment, coffee processing facilities and farm inputs.
The project also provided for financial assistance to KPCU to expand its milling
capacity with a new facility at Dardora. Both of these components were to be parallel
financed by Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC). To address the training
requirements of the industry, financed
under the IDA credit and GOK, the project was to expand CRFs training facilities and
conduct training programs in coffee production and processing, including training
programs for MOA extension staff. A component was also included to support a
Technical Management Services Unit within KPCU for the small estate sector.
C. IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE
General
6   The project, approved by the World Bank Board in September 1989 became effective
in August 1990, the delay resulting mainly from the time taken to introduce the
improved payment system, which was a condition of effectiveness. The start-up process
was slow because of the preparations r equired in advance of the launch of the credit
schemes, particularly the technical design and appraisal work r equired for the factor-y
development. On the ground activities started in 1993. A mid-term review was
undertaken in February 1995. Following an extension of one year to the closing date to
enable the factory renovation program to be completed, the credit closed on 30 June
1998. A total of SDR 34.4 million of the SDR 36.5 million was disbursed (94%). Due to
variations in SDR/US$ exchange rates, whilst the original principal was equivalent to
US$46.8 million, a higher amount equivalent to US$48.1 million was disbursed.
7  Preliminary estimates of the cost of the project were US$ 59 million as against an
appraisal target of US$ 106.8 million. The difference can be accounted for by the fact
that the proposed KPCU coffee mill and the component for assistance to the snmall
estate sub-sector did not proceed (estimated costs US$29.3 million), that the factory
rehabilitation component was not as extensive as anticipated and significant
depreciation of the Kenya Shilling during implementation.

Specific Activities
8   Specific activities of the project were:
9   Improved Payment Scheme (IPS) and Chery Advance Pajymeuit Sclheme (CAPSh The
project was instrumental in introducing an Improved Payment System for coffee
producers. This system provides for an advance payment at harvest for cherry
delivered to cooperative society factories and for a prompt and direct payment
mechanism from auction to cooperative society account to significantly reduce the
payment time lag that previously was a factor that curbed farmer interest in growing
coffee.
10 Notwithstanding the general production decline and fluctuations in coffee prices on the
world market during the project period, IPS had a positive impact on the timing of
payments to farmers. CAPS, in particular, gave farmers a cash payment following the
delivery of cherry. To respond to farmers' wishes and to simplify administration, the
payments were generally made in the January following the main harvest period of
October to December. The period of receiving the first payment after delivery of
cherry was thereby reduced to less than around 2 months as opposed to about 12-13
months before the project.
11 The IPS, in conjunction with the introduction of outside-the-pool payments,
significantly improved the cash flow of societies, enabling more timely payments to
farmer members. It also became possible to reward quality at the factory level since
payments could be clearly identified with the source of the coffee. Currently, payments
are received by the societies within 14 days from the date of auction, but there remain
delays in final payments to farmers since societies in practice wait until the bulk of
production has been sold before final payments are made. The timing varies widely
depending on the society, but now generally the effective total timne elapsed between
harvest and final payment now is between six to nine months, compared to up to 18
months before the project.
12 A total of 214 societies now participate in this scheme and, whilst the estates do not
benefit from the CAPS program, some 61 estates did benefit from the IPS. As seasonal
credit, the CAPS funds are maintained in Coop Bank as a revolving fund. A total of
approximately KSh 908 million (US$ 15.1 million) was disburseV.
13  Factory Developmient Loan Scheme (FDLS). A total of 24 new factories have been
built, and 226 renovated under this scheme at a cost of approximately KSh 710 million
(US$ 11.8 million). The project fell short of the appraisal targets (65 new and 275
rehabilitation) mainly due to a downturn in overall production following the start-up of
the project. It was recognized during 1993 that additional capacity was not
immediately required and the project's emphasis should be on factory renovations. The
project did support both new factories and additional capacity in renovated factories
whereby, at the end of the project with production levels down, the cooperative
subsector now has factory capacity that is presently under-utilized, estimated to be
56%o based on the 1997/98 production levels. This has increased financial overheads of
the societies due to debt service obligations. A significant project activity, later also
7 CAPS was ftutlher supported by a conitribution oi STABEX fiuids of KSIs 190,0Di (IJS$ 3.2 iiiion)



4
supported by STABEX funds, was the electrification of existing factories, which has
reduced operating costs, r educed losses due to breakdowns, and has had the indirect
but significant developmental effect of providing electricity in more r emote locations
for other purposes.
14. Farm Inp at Loan Schteme (FILS): FILS was designed to provide affordable credit
terms for farm inputs, crucial to pi-oduction and quality, in a general environment of
high commercial interest rates. The Coop Bank was operating Cooperative Production
Credit Schemes (CPCSs) and the new injection of funds under the project was to
provide incremental credit to increase the use of inputs over existing levels that were
judged to be sub-optimal. A total of approximately KSh 920 million (US$ 15.3 million)
was disbursed for this component.
15  In practice, however, FILS effectively replaced CPCS as FILS credit was available at
lower interest rates. Whilst the presence of FILS assisted in enabling the continued use
of inputs in times of reduced margins and incomes, levels of use did not r ise to optimal
levels for the following reasons. Firstly, there is a lag between coffee price changes and
renewed effort in production. Prices fell in the period 1991 to 1993, prompting less
input use. The sharp increases in coffee prices in 1995 would have lifted interest in
coffee management and input use, but the production met the market in 1996, again a
time of lower international prices. Secondly, limits on the funds undei the FILS
program meant that the rise in demand in 1995 could not be fully met. Also, in times of
poorer climatic conditions and uncertainty in the industiy (see below), it is likely that
inputs wei-e diverted to other crops.
16  Training n/d lnstitutional strengthen,ing: One of the project objectives was to
strengthen the capacities of institutions involved in the coffee industry with special
emphasis on those involved in project implementation. The main beneficiaries of this
activity were the Cooperative Bank, the PCMU, the Coffee Research Foundation
(CRF), and the Ministries of Cooperatives and of Agriculture.
17 The Cooperative Bank was the main institution responsible for three credit components.
It has done a creditable job as an effective lending institution for its clients in the coffee
industry. Due to project intervention, the bank has adopted sound accounting principles
and practices. With the help of PCMU, the Bank has build up its capacity to review and
evaluate proposals for possible financing. It also has adopted revised and improved
procurement procedures.
IX  The day to day execution of the project components was the responsibility of the
PCMU. Lessons learned fi-om SCIP I were incorporated in the operational aspects of
operating the PCMU. It was able to operate as a semi autonomous unit. It was
composed of highly qualified competent and motivated staff. Consequently it became
an efficient management unit contributing greatly to the smooth implementation
success of this project.
19  CRF training facilities were strengthened by the project financing a new training
facility and dormitory. During a visit to the new training facility, which became
operational only in July 1997, due to a number of construction delays, a suggestion was
made to increase effort in the training of extension field staff. This was seen as
particularly important to help farmers to increase their coffee production after the



5
production declines over the last few years which was due to, among other things, the
unfavorable weather conditions.
20 A review of the training financed by the project shows that this was a successful
activity, with the possible exception of training of the coffee extension field officers.
Since the new training facility at CRF was opened in 1997, 233 coffee factory managers
and engineers from 17 districts were trained, and 51 extension officers from the central
province received training. Many field extension officers benefited from intensive field
days organized by CRF. During project appraisal, it was observed that extension staff
concentrated their field activities on food crops at the expense of giving advice on coffee
production and tree management. Observations in the field showed no change of
emphasis in spite of the project's significant support in terms of extension staff training
opportunities and mobility8.
21. Environmental impact Proper coffee cultivation generally would have a positive
environmental impact in that it improves soil moisture retention and reduces erosion.
However two activities could have an adverse effect; misuse of chemicals and improper
handling of coffee pulp and processing effluent. The project minimized the possible
negative impact through the use of approved chemicals, encouraging the growing of
disease resistant varieties (R 11). The positive environmental impact of the factory
development was substantial. Each factory improvement under the project installed a
system of full water recirculation, pulping towers, and pollution control. Some of the
factories were resited in order to comply with this requirement.
Major Factors Affecting the Project
22 The project was well designed to address constraints to production and quality that
were in evidence at the time of appraisal, and was implemented well. However, the
project was working in an industry environment in which many major factors had
direct impacts on the level of achievement of its objectives. These were as follows:
23  Seasonial Growving Conditionis and Idternationala Prices: During the 1980s, coffee
production in Kenya showed a steady growth to about 120,000 tons in 1988. Based on
this growth, the Government predicted an annual growth of about 8%/, giving a
production estimate of 350 000 tons by the year 20009. World Bank estimates of growth
during appraisal of SCIP II was a modest 1.5%/. per annum, taking into account the
financial and marketing problems facing the industry. Growth in the cooperative
sector was estimated at an incremental yield of 18,000 tons over a 7-year period due to
SCIP 11 project activities.
24 Seasonal conditions and international prices have had an impact on production and
quality of coffee over the life of the project. The collapse of the International Coffee
Agreement brought prices lower during 1991. Drought in 1992 and two subsequent
seasons contributed to declines in production from levels during 1985 to 1990
averaging in excess of 110,000 tons annually to 75,000 tons. In the Coop sector, coffee
production showed a dramatic reduction from about 80,000 tons in 1988 to 40,000 tons
in 1993. Whilst weather certainly played a major factor in this decline, weather alone
was not the only negative factor. International coffee prices fell and a number of

uncertainties about the industry liberalization announced in 1992 had the effect of
creating some uncertainty, particularly on the part of smallholders. However, with the
weather improving in 1994 and the full implementation of SCIP Il, production in the
cooperative sector improved to about 60,000 tons in 1994 and 1995, with the crop
benefiting from higher international coffee,prices. The crop was again adversely
affected by the weather as a result of continued rains during October/November 1997
resulting in a total production forecast of 60,000 tons for 1998 with the cooperatives
sub-sector contributing approximately 35,000 tons.
25 Coli*e Mliing Soon after effectiveness of the project in late 1990, KPCU members
decided not to proceed with the investment in the expansion of their milling capacity by
50,000 tons. This had a major impact on the participation of CDC in cofinancing the
project, which subsequently decided not to participate. The effect on the industiy was
twofold: (i) on the negative side this meant that the small estate subsector was left
unassisted by SCIP II (see below) thereby neglecting a significant section of the coffee
producing farms in Kenya; (ii) on the positive side, following partial liberalization of
the industry (see below) the private sector started to invest in milling facilities to
compete directly with KPCU for provision of these services. Whilst the longer term
impact is expected to be positive, this move has led to divisions within the cooperative
sector and is cited as a major factor prompting the split of societies into smaller units,
dependent on the miller chosen by the society. Delays have been reported in selling
coffee coming from millers other than KPCU, causing delays in final payments to
coffee farmers.
26  Small Estate subsector Co-financed by CDC, this subsector was to have r eceived
support by the project through the provision of credit for factory investments and
seasonal inputs, and training. This component did not proceed due to CDC's
withdr awal from the project. This component could possibly have gone forward had an
acceptable financial intermediary been identified. Only during the last year of the
project a decision was made to include these farmers in the cooperative bank-lending
program.
27 The importance of this subsector is highlighted by the fact that of the more than 1,100
r egistered estates in 1989, about 750 were classified as small estates (between 4 and 20
ha accounting for 5000 ha in total). During the life of the project, the definition of small
estates was broadened to include farms between 2 and 20 ha. This meant a rise in
numbers in 1998 to 1,600 representing an estimated 7,000 ha. Most of these estates are
eligible to have their own small factory. Most of these growers are financially weak and
have no access to credit for investments and farm inputs, hence their performance is
poor.
28 Coffee Industry Liberalization: The implementation period of the project was
concurrent with deep-seated reforms, in both the political system and the economy, and
uncertainty is a product during this change process. As regards the coffee industry,
measures announced in October 1992 signaled the start of the r eform process. These
involved (i) the conduct of coffee sales in US dollars and exchanged at market rates,
thereby riemoving the implicit export tax that was depressing the farmers share of
export revenues from coffee production; (ii) the licensing of private sector millers; (iii)
the introduction of "outside the pool" payments. Whilst the topic of full liberalization of



7
the industry has been widely debated since 1992, there remains no clear vision for the
future structure of the industry which identifies the roles of the many institutions
involved, the marketing systems, and the financing of the industry. Farmers are being
exposed to differing views from the various participants in the industry.'These factors
have further contributed to uncertainty and division amongst coffee growers and have
had a negative effect on production,
Achievement of Objectives
29 The objective of this project had three elements; (i) to raise incomes of small holder
coffee farmers and small estates through improvements in coffee production and quality;
(ii) increase Kenya's foreign exchange earnings and maintain its position as a high quality
arabica coffee producer; and (iii) strengthen the institutional capacities of key participation
institutions.
30 Lncomes. Although a rise in incomes of small holder coffee producers, and the resulting
foreign exchange earnings, through increased production was not realized under the project
due to the factors mentioned above, the presence of the project would have had a positive
impact in these areas although it is difficult to identify and quantify. Further analysis will
be carried out in this area following the mission. The financial position of the participating
farmers did improve due to the introduction of IPS and CAPS and an improvement in
coffee quality. Since coffee is the main cash crop of these farmers, their cash flow was
improved as a result of the project. In addition, cooperative society factory operating costs
have gone down (from almost 40%/u to 20-25%) in participating societies, hence more of the
final proceeds were passed on to the farmer. The average proportion of the net payment
received by the societies from coffee sales (after deduction of statutory and marketing
charges) that is now passed on to the farmer has risen to 69%.
31 One of the objectives of the project was to improve smallholder coffee quality, which
was at an all time low during project preparation. Coffee falling in the 7-10 class and mbuni
had reached 32°/,, up from 14%6 in earlier years. By 1994 the quality had improved
significantly showing that class 1-6 reached 75% (up from 68%) and classes 7-10 and mbuni
25 °f%. From a sample of ten societies taken in 1998, quality had further increased whereby
the proportion in classes 1-6 had reached 80,3%/., with 7-10 and mbuni 19.7%". It is likely
that the project contributed towards improving quality, but it is difficult to quantify this
due to the many factors that influence quality, both external to the project as well as factors
that the project was addressing.
32. Due to the over all increase in quality, over the project period, Kenya has been able to
maintain its position as a high quality producer in the coffee markets thus receiving a 14 to
15% bonus in price.
33 The impact on strengthening of the key institutions directly involved in the project is
mentioned above.
Sustainability and Future Operations
34 The sustainability and future of this project depends foremost on the will of the farmers
to continue to grow high quality coffee in an ever changing environment. Coffee is



8
responsive to favorable management and good growing conditions and production can
quickly rise to former levels. The following is a summary of the major issues that will
impact on the future:
35 It was never envisaged that the management unit PCMU would be a permanent body
after the project. However, most of the key staff underwent technical training and gained a
great deal of experience during the life of the project. No decision has yet been made on how
to employ this expertise in other institutions involved in the future operations of the project.
In addition to opportunities in the private sector, both the Ministries of Agriculture and of
Cooperatives may use the expertise in coffee extension, monitoring and evaluation. It would
be unfortunate to loose this expertise from the cooperative sector.
36 The establishment of a Steering Committee was positive step in providing a forum for
coordination and discussion of issues relevant to the project and to the industry. The
continuation of this Committee would be valuable as a future place for discussion and
resolution of future issues in the industry.
37 The coffee extension activities under the Ministry of Agriculture will continue and it is
likely that the Ministry will again train specialists in coffee production at the district level,
as this crop specific advice was one of the weaknesses observed during project
implementation. It is expected that cost effective extension methods now being employed -
radio, coffee field days,barazas- will continue. As already evidenced, other groups,
including the private sector, are involved in advising farmers, and are becoming more
widespread. Through the strengthening of the training facilities at CRF, training in all
aspects of coffee production, processing and marketing is likely to continue, through
support from levies and charges for training courses. These facilities will also be the forum
to pass on up-to date information and new developments in coffee crop production and
processing
38 The IPS scheme is now very much part of the industry and it is considered that any
future restructuring would maintain this system.
39. The core to sustainability of activities supported by SCIP 1I however depends on issues
surrounding the future of the credit component that affect the financial viability of the
participants. Coop Bank now has a portfolio of SCIP II lending to the Cooperative sector
amounting to approximately KSh 600 million, representing around 10%, of its total lending
portfolio. There are many relevant factors that need to be considered in the context of the
future performance of this portfolio including: the overall financial viability and
international competitiveness of the industry (including macro-economic conditions); the
financial status of societies as regards overhead costs; the practice of societies splitting and
thereby increasing total overheads; the current under-utilization of factory capacity; the
departure from the membership of societies of farmers with coffee farms in excess of 5 acres
(2 ha); the practice of smallholder coffee growers, members of societies, unlawfully selling
cherry to buyers outside thei- societies; the practice of "double hypothecation" of the coffee
whereby loans from more than one source are secured on the same production. All of these
could have the effect of increasing the risk of default on this debt, and future uncertainties
in the SCIP II portfolio is expected to be a matter of concern for Coop Bank.



9
40 At the farmer level, the relative input/output costs and returns from coffee production
will determine the future participation by farmers in the industry, and the level of
management and other inputs required. In par-ticular, this will determine the overall
demand for credit and the cost which the farmers can afford to pay for that credit. With the
repayment of IDA advances for the credit schemes, particularly for CAPS and FILS, and
the resulting necessity for Coop Bank to use its own funds for this lending, the cost of
borrowing must progressively rise from the present concessional rates to commercial rates.
Under current conditions, this would make the credit for farm inputs unaffordable and
demand for the scheme low.
41 However, it is considered that equally important for the future are the questions
relating to increasing confidence in all participants. Clear statements on the Government's
vision for the future of the industry are urgently required, defining roles and rules. In
addition, in order for the industry to be internationally competitive and sustainable, all the
participants would need fair and equitable returns for their investment in and their
contribution to added valued within the production/processingl marketing chain within the
industry.
Lessons Learned
42 The key lessons learned from this project can be summarized as follows:
*  The design of a long-term project involving many institutions and
beneficiaries (coffee farmers) should be flexible and simple with a
minimum of key conditionalities. Such was the case in this project.
*  After the withdrawal of the CDC financing, the project should have made
provision for financial and technical assistance to the increasingly
important small estate sub sector and training of KPCU staff.
*  It was beyond the scope of the project to address some of the wider and
possibly contentious policy issues facing the industry reforms today, but
these issues were continually raised during supervision. As this was a
major factor during implementation and affects sustainability of the
project, the project should have been implemented in conjunction with of a
wider process of industry reform specifically for the coffee sector agreed
between the World Bank and GOK.
*  Delegation of project supervision to the World Bank team located in the
field was highly desirable for ensuring timely client service during project
start-up; clearance of bidding documents; processing of disbursement
requests and implementation adjustments to the project in response to the
changing environment facing the coffee industry.
Conclusion
43 The physical implementation of the main project components was satisfactory.
However, taking in consideration some critical events that took place during project



10
implementation, which were beyond the control and influence of the project, the overall
outcome of the project was mixed.

CHAPTER I
1.   INTRODUCTION
1.1   Background
The Second Coffee Improvement Project (SCIP II) was closed on 30'h June 1998
after eight years of implementation. According to the protect design SCIP II was
supposed to be implemented from i' August, 1990 to 30' June, 1997 a period of
seven years. However, an extension of one year was considered to enable PCMU
complete the Coffee Factory Development Scheme (CFDS) component which had
been delayed because of the time it took to fulfill the pre-conditions.
The project was jointly funded by the World Bank's International Development
Association (US$ 46.8M), the Government of Kenya (US$ 7.4M), and Coffee
Cooperative Societies (US$ 11.2M), and Co-operative Bank of Kenya (US$
12.1M).   An additional US$ 18.OM of external financing was to be made
available by Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) to be lent to the
Small/Medium Coffee Estates for capital development (irrigation equipment,
coffee factory development and farm equipment) and expansion of coffee milling
capacities for Kenya Planter's Co-operative Union (KPCU). The Small/Medium
Coffee Estates planters were to contribute US$ 0.7M while US$ 10.6M was to be
funded by KPCU. Therefore, the total project cost at appraisal was US$ 106.8
Million. However, the financing plan for the small coffee estate sub-sector and
coffee milling capacity expansion was not realized, thus this component was not
implemented.
Prior to the project implementation, the smallholder coffee sub-sector was
experiencing severe constraints which included the following:-
*: Coffee payments were delayed upto one year and more, between cherry
delivery to farmers receiving the initial payment.
*: There were a series of unexplained or unauthorized deductions at various
stages in the coffee payments flow (deductions were as high as 60%).
*: Lack of working capital to finance labour and farn inputs.
*: Inadequate coffee processing capacities due to lack of capital investments -
which led to congestion during peak pulping season, hence coffee qualitv
declined.
*: Pollution of streams/rivers during coffee processing period.
*. High cost of farm inputs as a result of flawed procurement procedures
I



*: High cost of factory constructions due. to the procurement system which was
not transparent and cost effective.
U Un-coordinated training programmes by many institutions resulting in
different and sometimes conflicting messages being passed to coffee farrmers.
The net effect of these constraints were that the smaliholder coffee farmers were
uncertain about the timing and extent of the expected returns. In view of this
farmers were not applying inputs to their coffee trees nor were they following the
recommended husbandry methods. Neglect of the coffee farms was evident which
contributed to sharp decline in coffee production and poor coffee quality
1.2   The Project's Objectives
The project's objective was therefore, to address these problems in order to raise
coffee farmer's income in the smallholder and small/medium coffee estate sub-
sectors through increased coffee production and coffee quality improvement.
Other related objectives were to increase foreign exchange earnings create
employment in the rural areas and strengthen the institutional capacities of the key
participating agencies.
CHAPTER 2:
2.0   THE PROJECT
To achieve the stated objectives, the project provided credit to finance the
following credit lines for the small holder coffee farmers:-
*. Improved Payment System (IPS)
: Cherry Advance Payment System(CAPS)
46 Farn Input Loans Scheme (FILS)
*: Coffee Factory Development Scheme (CFDS)
*: Training Programmes
*: Establishment of Project Co-ordination and Management Unit
*. Institutional support to the key implementing organizations
*: Small Coffee Estates and expansion of coffee milling capacity
The background, objectives, funds allocation and targets of each of the JN<.ic
components (except Small Coffee Estates and expansion of KPCU wiiljr1z
capacity at project appraisal and achievements are discussed in details beloA
2



2.1   Improved Payment System (IPS)
2.1.1  Background
Prior to the implementation of SCIP I[, coffee payments experienced chronic
shortcomings in the following areas: -
*' There was a considerable time lag of up to one year and above between cherry
* delivery and receipt of initial coffee payments to farmers.
*: The intermediaries (Cooperative Societies, Unions and KPCU) held payments
for too long before passing it to the farmers.
*: There were numerous unexplained and/or unauthorized deductions effected at
various stages before the farmers finally received their net dues.
The net effect of these shortcomings were that coffee returns were extremely low
and timing of the expected payments was uncertain. Therefore, farmers were not
motivated to continue injecting money into their coffee farns. The uncertainty
discouraged smaliholder coffee fanners from increasing coffee production and
improving coffee quality.
2.1.2  Objectives of IPS
The [PS was therefore designed to address these inherent problems in order to
encourage the smallholder coffee farmers to increase their productivity and
improve coffee quality through: -
. Establishment of two accounts namely, Society Operation Expenses Account
(SOEA) and Members Payment Account (MPA) in the Co-operative Bank.
* Undertaking coffee societies cost reviews to predetermine the ratio that should
be paid into the SOEA and the MPA. This was necessary in order to ensure
that farmers received the highest possible payment from their coffee proceeds
The ratio has gradually improved from 70% % to 80% and 30% to 20% for
MPA and SOEA respectively, for the majority of the societies. For the well
managed coffee societies the ratio has improved to more than 90% and less
than 10% for the MPA and SOEA respectively.
*: Making prompt coffee payments directly from the Coffee Board of Kenya
(CBK) to the coffee society's two accounts held at the Cooperative Bank.
3



2.2    Cherry Advance Payment System (CAPS)
2.2.1  Background
The CAPS is a short term credit facility availed to farmners at an annual interest
rate of 15% during coffee picking period. It has proved to be popular and useful to
farmers. A Revolving Fund has been established at the Cooperative Bank from an
initial injection of about KShs. 750 Million.
2.2.2  Objectives of CAPS
The objective of CAPS is to provide smallholder coffee farners with cash
advances during the coffee-picking period for farmn operations and other family
expenses. Since this forms part of the cash earnings from  coffee payments,
waiting time for the payments is shortened.
The following are the accruing benefits of CAPS: -
* Eased farmer's financial burden during the critical coffee pricking period.
*  Reduced the time the farmers had to wait for receiving the initial coffee
paymrent.
* Discouraged farmners from selling their cherry to middlemen at very low
prices
-  Encouraged and enabled coffee farrmers to pick their coffee at the correct time
and not to allow the cherry to dry into Mbuni that fetches low prices in the
market.
-' No loan/debts deductions are made from CAPS.
-  The cherry advance is self-liquidating from coffee proceeds within the year.
2.3    Farm Inputs Loans Scheme (FILS)
2.3.1  FILS Background
Before implementation of SCIP ll, smallholder coffee farmers had no tormal
arrangement for financing farmn inputs. The only credit facilities wkhich w%ere
available were largely commercial loans from Cooperative Bank and to a lesser
extent other comrnercial banks. The credit duration was 90 days atler w%hich
farrners were required to repay the loan in full. The credit facilitv attracted
unsustainable interest rates. The smallholder's coffee farrners could theretore not
readily access the required inputs, which contributed to the decline in coffee
productivity.
The other prevalent problem with most coffee societies and unions w%as the ov er
procurement of farm inputs and the quality of the inputs was often questionable
Coffee societies did not use the open tender procurement system and %% hich led to
very high farm inputs prices charged to the coffee farmers.
4



2.3.2  Objectives of FILS
FILS was therefore designed to provide a credit facility to smallholder coffee
farners for procurement of fertilizers, chemicals and hand tools. Assessment of
each individual member input requirements was aggregated into society totals,
followed by procurement through open and well-publicized tendering procedures.
The award is made on the basis of the lowest evaluated bid. This ensured that the
correct quantity and quality of inputs is procured at the most competitive prices.
The credit is administered through the Cooperative Bank at an interest rate of
15% per annum (there was a recommendation to hedge at 2 % below the Coop
Bank's base interest rate prevailing at the time) to the smallholder coffee farrners.
The loan has to be repaid within a period of two years, which includes a grace
period of one year.
2.4   Coffee Factory Development Scheme (CFDS)
2.4.1  Background
During implementation of Smallscale Coffee Improvement Project(SCIP 1), 183
new/resited and 280 coffee factories were rehabilitated. However, despite the
large number of factory developments after closing of SCIP I, two main
shortcomings were identified by the Project Completion Report. They include the
following:-
*: The design and supervision of coffee factory construction were only based on
technical feasibility studies without consideration of undertaking economic
and financial appraisals.
*: Failure to carry out economic and financial appraisals led to high default in
loan repayments.
It had been observed that coffee societies were still incurring considerable
financial losses as a result of inadequate and poor processing facilities despite the
major investments in factory constructions during SCIP I. Therefore, the mistakes
identified in SCIP I were corrected during implementation of SCIP 1I Coffee
Factory Development Scheme. The focus shifted to rehabilitation and
improvement of existing factories through renovation, resiting or electrification
with a limited number of new factory constructions. The factory development
investments were only recommended for funding after undergoing technical and
economic/financial appraisal.
2.4.2  Objectives of CFDS
To improve coffee quality through development and improvement of coilte
processing facilities. This involved the rehabilitation of existing coffee factones
5



and construction of new ones. This was to alleviate the congestion experienced
during the peak coffee processing season, shorten distance traveled by farmers
when delivering their cherry to the factories, reduce annual operating expenses,
and reduce pollution to rivers.
2.5   Project Implementation
The PCMU was in charge of the day today management of the project whereas
the Project Steering Committee (PSC) was the apex policy body. The Unit was
staffed with a multi-disciplinary team of professionals on secondment from
Ministry of Cooperative Development, Ministry of Agriculture, Parastatals and
other Government Departments. The General Manager was responsible for the
day-to-day operations of PCMU and the project. The Technical Staff comprised
Engineers, Economists, Agronomists and Co-operative Specialists, who were
under the Manager, Technical Services. The Finance and Administration Section
was headed by Manager, Finance and Administration and had Administrative
Officer, Accountants, Secretaries, Drivers, Clerks and Support Staff.
All the project components have been implemented with high degree of success
except the small/medium coffee estates and expansion of KPCU coffee mill at
Dandora, Nairobi. These two components were not implemented because of the
non-fulfillment of conditions set out during the project design. Release of funds
for these investments were subject to a study being carried out to establish the
modalities of credit disbursements/recovery system, identification of on-lending
institution and procurement procedures. Funds for the preparation of a project
proposal for the smallUmedium coffee estates were not availed until 1996, when
the World Bank and GOK mandated PCMU to conduct the study. The project
proposal was completed but has not been appraised.
As mentioned eariier, the project closed on 30'h June 1998 after eight years ot
implementation.    During this period the project has undergone various
modifications in terms of implementation of the activities/components as
recommended by the projects internal monitoring and evaluation system.
Supervision and mid-term review missions carried out by the World Bank
provided the necessary guidance that assisted in tackling impiementation
constraints and suggested appropriate remedial measures. Although, the project
has achieved its objectives it is necessary that the impact of the project be
quantified. In order to assess the impact of the project to the beneficianes.
PCMU collected data from a sample of coffee societies in eight selected coffee-
growing districts.

CHAPTER 3
3.0   STUDY METHODOLOGY:
3.1   Study Area:
Kenya's Arabica coffee is mainly grown to the East of the Rift Valley in Central
and Eastern Provinces. The other coffee growing districts are located in Westem
and Nyanza Provinces, West of the Rift and Taita Taveta District in Coast
Province. Fewer districts grow coffee in Rift Valley Province. Nationally, coffee
is currently grown in 44 districts.
SCIP covered all the coffee growing districts in the country. The level of
participation in the project by each district determined the study area. The levels
of project participation was categorised as high, moderate and low and was
influenced by the time the districts started participating in SCIP II, which project
components they were participating in and the general attitude to credit uptake.
The region East of the Rift has a high level of project participation as compared to
West of Rift. This may partly explain why the selected districts in East of the Rift
are more than those from West of the Rift. This is shown in Table 4.1, which
indicates the coffee growing districts selected in each province from which the
sample of coffee societies was drawn.

3.2   Sampling Method:
The 44 Coffee Growing Districts formed the sampling frame from  %hi.a h
districts were selected according to their level of SCIP II participation
explained above. There were four categories of respondents namrely. e  c
7



Farners, Secretary Managers, Coffee Factory Managers, and District Co-
operative Officers. Due to the large number of selected coffee societies and
factories only 2 coffee farmers were considered for interview from 5 coffee
societies in each of the 8 selected districts giving a total number of 80 farmer
interviewees. The other sub-samples comprised of 8 District Co-operative
Officers, 40 Secretary Managers, and 40 Coffee Factory Managers.
4 list of 5 coffee farmers in the surrounding area of the factory who have been
participating in all the project components was compiled and two farmers were
randomly selected for the interview. The sub-sample of District Co-operative
Officers was drawn from the 8 selected districts while that of Secretary Managers
and Coffee Factory Managers was also randomly selected from a list of coffee
societies and factories from the selected districts.
3.3   Timing:
Field administration of the questionnaires was done between the 10th of March
and the 31st of March 1998.
3.4    Data Collection:
The data was collected using different types of questionnaires each designed for
the four categories of respondents namely, coffee farmers, secretary managers,
coffee factory managers, and District Cooperative Officers.
Three teams comprising officers from MOCD, MOA, PCMU and Coffee
Research Foundation (CRF) administered the questionnaires in the field. One
group covered Kericho, Kisii, Nyamira, Bungoma and Mt. Elgon Districts while
the second group covered Makueni, Machakos, Meru Central, Meru South and
Embu Districts. The third group covered Nyeri, Muranga, Maragua, Thika and
Kiambu Districts in Central Province.
3.5   Data Analysis:
The data analysis involved manually going through the completed questionnaires
and calculating frequency counts for each varnable. The data was then summansed
into grouped and ungrouped frequency distributions and fed into the cross
tabulation formats. The study findings are drawn from percentage distributions
calculated.
3.6   Problems Encountered and Data Limitations:
The quality of data collected was fairly good because the questionnaires were
administered by officers who are familiar with enumeration. However. field
extension staff administered a few questionnaires because the respondents uere
8



unavailable during the scheduled time of the interviews. As a result some
questionnaires had data gaps or validation was not done.
The sampling method used could affect the quality of data because only the
project beneficiaries who participated in the project were considered in the study.
Data was collected on some paraneters with and without project for comparison
purposes. The data collected was not exhaustive due to the available time and
logistic constraints.
Despite these shortcomings, the data collected was fairly reliable in generating the
information required to assess the impact of the project.
CHAPTER 4:
4.0   STUDY FINDINGS
4.1   Potential for Coffee Expansion
More than half (57%) of the farm sizes range betNveen 2.1 and 5.0 acres in the
west of the Rift as compared with 38% in East of the Rift. 40% of the Farm
holdings in the West of the Rift are greater than 5.0 acres as compared with 31%
in the East of the Rift. Table 4.1 shows the proportion of land under crop
cultivation and fallow land.

Source: Study Findings
Potential for coffee expansion is to the West of the due to abundant land and not
in the region East of the Rift according to the study findings. Therefore, increase
in coffee production to the East of the Rift can only be realized by increasing
productivity due to the limited land availability for coffee expansion. Besides land
availability for coffee expansion in the West of the Rift, the region is endo%%ed
with favourable climatic conditions and good soils.

Source: Study Findings
Nine % of the respondents East of Rift compared 100% of those from West of
Rift had Planted some Ruiru 11. On the other hand all the respondents East of Rift
grow the traditional varieties.
When compared with the traditional varieties, Ruiru It is high yielding, has high
plant population per land unit and cost of production is reduced by 30%. With this
good economic attributes, it was expected that incidence of Ruiru 1I planting
would be relatively higher in the East of the Rift. However, the study findings
indicated that it was low (9%) as shown in Table 4.2. The reasons given by the
farmers included the following:
: Scarcity of land
4. Loss of income during replacement period until maturity time. This normally
takes about two years.
Cooclusion
* There is room for coffee expansion in the West of the Rift. A programme for
coffee expansion West of Rift should be evaluated.
* Coffee Research Foundation should come up with a methodology acceptable
to the farmer, for replacing traditional variety with Ruiru 1I without risking
much loss of income due to missed harvest by the farmner.
I lntensified training should be continued in order to train farmers on
appropriate technology to be adopt in replacing traditional coffee vaneties
with Ruiru 11.

4.2   Improved Payment System (IPS)
4.2.1  Rate and Duration of Coffee Payments
When the Secretary Managers were asked when their respective coffee societies
joined IPS, 67% reported that they joined it in 1991/92, 21% in 1992/93 while the
rest after 1992/93.
When asked the duration between the time when the farmers delivered their
coffee to the factory and when they were paid before IPS introduction, 28% of the
respondents reported that the first main coffee payment were made within 4
months while 62% reported the payment coming after 4 months.
However, after joining IPS, the study revealed that in 1996/97, 66% of the
respondents reported that payments were received within 4 months, while 26%
said payments came between 4 to 8 months.
The study findings indicated that before joining IPS, 63% of the societies were
paying less than 70% of the society's gross realization, while 38% paid more than
70%. On the other hand, in 1996/97 after IPS implementation, 85% of the
societies were paying over 70% while only 15% of the societies paid less than
70%. Therefore, it can be inferred that implementation of IPS has resulted in
improvement of the percentage rate of payment to coffee farmers while the
duration of waiting for the payments has been minimized after [PS
implementation. This is shown in Table 4.2.1 below.

4.2.2  Coffee Society Cost Review Committee (CSCRC)
Although, CSCRC were introduced in coffee growing districts since 1992. the
study revealed that 46% of the Secretary Managers interviewed were not aware of
these committees whereas 54% reported being aware of the existence of the
comrnittees. On whether these Secretary Managers who reported awareness ol
CSCRC knew the objectives of these committees, all of them reported in the
affirmative. However, the Secretary Managers who reported that they were not
aware of the existence of CSCRC said that they were new in their emplovment
11



(94%) and had not attended any awareness training on the CSCRC and their
objectives. In view of this, it is apparent that the Chairmen of the CSCRC did not
continue with the training of the Secretary Managers on the objectives and
operations of the committees.
On the establishment and operationalisation of these committees, the study
findings indicated that out of the 8 District Cooperative Officers interviewed,
only three districts - two in West of Rift (i.e. Kericho and Bungoma) and one in
Central Province (i.e. Muranga) reported having constituted the CSCRC's and
that they were operational.  The rest reported not having constituted and
operationalised these committees due to the following reasons:
*:. Insufficiency of funds to run the CSCRC
*: Delay in preparation and submission of Trial Balances (TB)
* Society Management reluctant or against the idea of having CSCRC assisting
them to review society operational expenses.
About 57% of the Secretary Managers reported having not attended meetings of
CSCRC.  The low attendance of these meetings could be attributed to the
Chairmen of the CSCRC not convening these meetings.
Of the districts which have constituted the CSCRC's, 89% of the Secretary
Managers reported that these committees have assisted in the control of societies
expenditures with subsequent increase in coffee payments to farmers. Also 71 %
of the DCO's reported that CSCRC had assisted societies to reduce their operating
expenses.
Overall, the study findings indicated that most of the districts did not constitute
the CSCRC and where they were established, they were not operational.
About 75% of DCO's reported that societies in their districts implemented the
SOE recommendations while the quarter of the respondents did not appiv the
recommendations which was due following reasons;
*' Lower coffee income than expected due to a decline in coffee producton
while society overhead costs remained unchanged.
* High repair and maintenance costs
Conclusions
The conclusions, drawn include the following:
*  The percentage rate of payments to farners has increased while duration, t
waiting for the payments has shortened.
12



4  Establishment and operationalization of CSCRC is unsatisfactory and there is
need to re-evaluate on how they could be made functional.
4.3   Cherry Advance Payment System (CAPS)
4.3.1  CAPS Participation
About 69% of the societies interviewed started participating in CAPS in 1991/92,
which increased to 92% by 1995/96, but has declined to 67°/e in 1997/98. The
reasons for decrease in participation in CAPS were given as follows:
* Inadequate training programmeslpublicity
4  Low coffee payments
* Tedious payment procedures especially for the societies with few staff.
* Farmers receive payments much earlier following implementation of [PS.
The study findings indicated that CAPS uptake by Societies was higher in the
East of the Rift than in the West. The low participation from this region may be
attributed to the following reasons:
4 Lack of publicity/exposure during CAPS launching and continuous training e.g. in
Nyamira where societies thought that CAPS rate was constantly pegged at
Kshs. 1.50 per Kg. Cherry. This may be partly explained by the high tumover of
field extension officers who were not properly trained.
*: Wet processing is not done by some societies from the West of the Rift hence not
qualified CAPS. This is due to low coffee production which cannot support
investment of the smallest coffee factory model which requires a throughput of
84,000 Kg. cherry.
4.3.2  CAPS Payments
Rate of CAPS payments has progressively increased from Kshs. 1.50 per Kg in
1991 to an average of Kshs.4 per Kg Cherry, with some societies paid as high as
Kshs.7 per Kg of Cherry. The study findings indicate that nearly half of the
societies in 1994195, two thirds in 1995/96 and 71% of societies in 1996/97 paid
an average of Kshs.4.00 per Kg. of cherry respectively. However, in somc
districts e.g. Kericho district, the calculated rate of CAPS at Kshs.8.40 per Kg
cherry could not paid to farmers because of the other societies' loans
commitments.
Initially and according to how CAPS implementation was designed to work out. it
was supposed to be paid during coffee picking period. However. dunng
implementation the beneficiaries were found to prefer certain periods when thev
wanted CAPS paid instead of monthly payments which involved small amounts
13



From the study findings, half of the societies preferred CAPS payments during
coffee picking period while the rest preferred after coffee picking period. Those
societies which reported CAPS payment after coffee picking period were further
asked to say the payment duration, and 81% reported a period of less than 2
months while the rest reported 3 months.
However, most of the farmers preferred to be paid once per coffee season as
opposed to the initial CAPS design of monthly payments due to the following
reasons:
* To accumulate cherry deliveries and pay once.
* Hold payments so as to coincide with family expenditures e.g school fees.
*: Monthly manual processing of CAPS is expensive for the society due to the
time and amount of stationary consumed. However when computerization of
the Member Transaction (MT) Coffee is implemented, these bottlenecks will
be alleviated.
About two thirds of the farmers (65%) said they used CAPS money to pay labour
for coffee picking and school fees while 25% reported meeting family expenses
e.g. medical bills, food etc.
On whether coffee farmers apply for other Advances apart from CAPS, the
DCO's indicated the following types of advances to meet their financial
requirements:
% School fees (35%),
4-, Crop advance e.g. to purchase fann inputs (55%) which was reported from
West of the Rift where there was limited FILS uptake.
- Funeral/medical expenses.
The proportion of coffee farmers who applied for other advances was 56%. This
was confirmed by half of the Secretary Managers interviewed from West of the
Rift and 44% from East of the Rift to meet school fees. From the East of the Rift
83% of the respondents reported that farmers used the other advances to meet
medical expenses. The other advances were parchment advance (18%) given by
Coffee Board of Kenya and crop advance (21%) given by societies from Societv
Operating Expenses Account.
On whether deductions were made from CAPS 84% of the farmers and Secretary
Managers reported that there were none.
Therefore the study findings confirm that CAPS money was paid in conformilv
to what it was the intended.
When asked whether CAPS had met its objective of assisting coffee farmers mcet
their financial requirements during coffee picking season, 85% of the Secretary
Managers and 70% of the DCO's responded in the affirmative. The rest ot ihe
14



respondents mainly from West of Rift (nearly a third) indicated that CAPS was
not assisting their members meet their financial needs because of inadequate
member education/training and low rate of CAPS caused by low coffee
production.
During monitoring of the project's implementation, it was noted that CAPS
uptake in East of Rift is very high as compared to wvest of Rift where it has been
low. As mentioned above, lack of information by the farmners due to inadequate
member education may have attributed to this poor uptake of CAPS in the region.
Those respondents in Central and Eastem who were not satisfied with CAPS to
meet their financial requirement was probably due to small amounts of CAPS
money which co1ld be attributed to low cherry deliveries.
The following are the improvements suggested in CAPS implementation:
* Farmers (53%), DCO's (31%) and a third of the secretary managers
recommended CAPS rate to be increased to more than 20% of the previous
year's rate of coffee payment.
* Continuos training of farmers and field staff is necessary.
*- Farmers * and DCO's (23%) said CAPS interest rates be lowered.
-- Additional funds be provided to meet the demand for CAPS.
-- Reduce processing costs of CAPS (13%)
'  Accumulate the CAPS payment to a sizable amount for payment to farmers as
reported from Eastern Province (9%)
. Prompt CAPS payment as suggested by Secretary Managers( 1 1/%)
-' The DCO's pointed out that CAPS recovery at society level should not be on pro-
rata but from individual beneficiaries.
Conclusions:
* CAPS has assisted farmers to meet labour costs during coffee picking period and
also other family expenses.
*: The demand for CAPS has not been met and hence more funds should be availed
to finance CAPS. Revolving Fund should be boosted.
* Continuous training is necessary especially West of the Rift to popularise CAPS
4.4.  Farm Input Loans Scheme (FILS)
4.4.1  Fils Participation
The study findings show that the FILS uptake by societies in the first two years
implementation was high as indicated by 84% of the societies which %ere
participating in FILS. During 1994/95, the participation and provision for FILS
declined but the demand for FILS was still high. Funds to satisfy this demand
were not available, as farmers had not started repaying the disbursed FILS In the
15



following year (1995/96), the FILS participation increased slightly due to
availability of Stabex Funds that were provided by the EU.
Nearly all the farmers (97%) interviewed indicated that they used FILS to procure
fertilizers, chemicals and hand tools e.g. spray pumps. This was collaborated by
75% of the Secretary Managers interviewed who reported that farmers purchased
fertilizers and chemicals. However, a few isolated cases of farmers reported that
FILS was used to procure consumer goods such as maize. FILS should not have
been used for this purpose because the affected farmers could have bought maize
using CAPS and other advances.
4.4.2  FILS Procedures
When asked whether farmers made requisition for the inputs by themselves,
which is a key FILS procedure, 95% of the Secretary Managers reported that this
requirement was followed. This response agrees with that indicated by the farmers
as majority of those interviewed (85%) reported that they are the ones who
decided on the type of input requirements. Only few farmers said that the decision
was made by the society management committee.
The other FILS procedure was the requirement for open tender in sourcing farm
inputs. On compliance with this procedure, 78% of the interviewed Secretary
Managers and 67% of the DCO's said the societies followed SCIP procedures.
However, 25% of the DCO's said some coffee societies used quotations while
Mugama Union in Central Province procured inputs by importation. It was
however, not verified if competitive bidding was applied.
Those who procured through quotations reported that they used this method to
reduce the cost of advertising in the press while those doing the direct importation
argued that they were getting inputs at lower prices and that bidding firms offered
competitive prices.
About 89% of the farmers said they obtained the right type of inputs and correct
quantities as per their requirements. More than two thirds of the farmers said they
received their inputs at the right time. Most of the interviewed Secretary
Managers (81%) indicated that they received their farm inputs within 30 days
after ordering. However, for the few societies which reported delays said it was
due to the long procurement procedures.
The coffee societies are expected to inform  their members when they are
applying, the unit price for each type of input for their requirements and the same
prices should prevail during time of issuance. The study findings indicated that
89% of the interviewed coffee farmers reported that the prices did not change
between application and delivery time.
On FILS repayment arrangements three quarters of the farmers reported being
satisfied with the arrangements for repayment while one quarter said they are not
16



satisfied. The reason given for non-satisfaction (32% df the farmers) is that
repayments should be spread to between 2 to 3 years.
On whether FILS objectives have been met, 86% of the Secretary Managers
reported that the FILS credit line has assisted farmers meet their input
requirements . The rest said it did not meet its objectives because of high interest
rate, the credit limit, farmers re-selling inputs and applying inputs to crops other
than coffee. The DCO's (78%) also confirmed that FILS met its objectives.
However, the rest said that FILS procedures were not followed which resulted in
inputs being issued to farmers who were not society members, in particular the
West of Rift. Also societies were discouraged when they applied for FILS which
was not approved due to non-availability of funds,
On measures the society had taken to ensure that farm inputs were applied to
coffee, the Secretary Managers indicated the following:-
*: Follow up by field committees
*: Use of spray/field teams
*i Member education
+ Enforcement of credit limit.
For FILS repayments, the following measure were taken to ensure that farmers
repaid their loans:-
3 Deductions at source for what each individual member received.
+' Enforcement of credit limit.
' Only active society members participated.
-* Member education.
From the study findings, the respondents suggested the following improvements
to be effected in FILS implementation:-
* Reduce interest rates
* Remove open tender (it is expensive).
*: Remove grace period.
*: Buy inputs directly from manufacturer.
" Increase grace period.
*: Lower price of inputs.
*: Include manure as one of the items of the farm inputs.
* Assess credit worthiness of farmers
*: Society to assist in follow-ups.
* Intensify training of farmers.
*: Timely procurement of inputs.
* Shorten FILS procurement procedures.
*I lmprove record keeping and society management.
17



Conclusion
The conclusions drawn are that overall the FILS procedures are being followed by
coffee societies. The FILS procurement procedures have by and large been
institutionalized. However further training of farmers on how they should be
implemented is necessary. Farmers seemed not to be aware of how FILS
operates. A case in point is Mugama Union where FILS procedures have not
been followed up to date. Societies should be allowed to procure inputs through
cbmpetitive bidding just like in the other districts.
4.5   Coffee Factory Development Scheme (CFDS)
4.5.1. CFDS Participation
About 93% of the farmers reported that General Meetings was held to approve
resolutions to invest in coffee factories. Only very few cases (7%) indicated that
this procedure was not followed.
The secretary managers (57%) interviewed reported that their societies had started
repaying loan investments in factories i.e. after the two year grace period.
Two thirds of the farmers indicated that coffee factory loan deductions do not
seriously affect the rate of coffee payment to farmers. Those who indicated that
loan deductions were affecting rates of payments gave the following reasons:
-- Costs of the loan (interest rate) causes low payments to farmers.
*:. Low through put due to refusal by farmers to deliver Cherry to the society
The Factory Managers reported that the following problems were experienced
before implementation of CFDS:
D Congestion during peak periods of coffee processing
+' Long distances traveled to deliver cherry to the factory
*: Water pollution
I lnsecurity within the factory
4.5.2 Constraints Solved by CFDS
The factory managers and farmers listed the following problems as having been
solved/alleviated by factory development investments:

Conclusion
CFDS has only been implemented for only three years. The loan repayments
have just started after the two years grace period. In order to assess the full
benefits accrued to CFDS; more data should be collected and analysed. The data
could not generate is over short time duration (2years) and, which could not be
used to evaluate the impact of this project component satisfactorily.
4.6   Training
Majority of the interviewees 82% farmers, 51% Secretary Managers and 61%
Factory Managers reported having attended training in the last 2 years. Although
training opportunities were offered to all coffee farmers, about 18% of them
reported that they did not attend any training progranmne for the last two years
The reasons given include the following:-
* No opportunity was given to the farmer,
* There was no training organized in the is area,
A* Management committee has not been finding out what training
programmes are organized by MOA.
* Training was organized when the farmers had other commitments
Secretary Managers said that they did not attend training because during the
period under consideration few training programmes were conducted.
However, during the interview it was found out that quite a number of secretarn
managers were new in their positions.
19



It is therefore recommended that training of Secretary Managers and farmers
should be continuous since new technical information need to be disseminated
including the new Cooperative Act which came into effect as from I' July 1998.
The types of training attended by farmers included Educational tours, Member
Education Days and Coffee field days whereas Secretary Managers attended
various Courses and Seminars Factory Managers on the other hand attended
Coffee Factory Managers Courses (CFM 1, CFM 11 and CFM 111).
Nearly all the farmers, 97% reported that the training offered was useful in
improving coffee husbandry. However, more training should be carried out on
coffee liberalization and coffee marketing, a subject that farmers appeared to lack
information on. Secretary Managers not only found the courses useful but also
that a number of them applied the skills/experiences learnt from the training.
Areas where the skills/knowledge were practiced were reported as follows:
*:¢ 57% said they applied the skills acquired in financial management.
* 20% in procurement procedures.
*: 13% used the training skills imparted to train their staff.
*: Few used the skills to improve society administration, coffee quality and
coffee husbandry
For Factory managers (96%) reported applying the skills in their work. Areas
where acquired skills were applied included:
-  54% in coffee processing
* 20% in factory management and maintenance
*: 13% in coffee nursery management.
* Few in coffee extension, marketing, coffee liberalization, legal and financial
transactions
On whether the Secretary Managers organized training for their junior staff in the
society after attending SCIP training 79% reported that they carried out such
training. The cadre of staff trained were Factory Managers/Assistant Factory
Managers, Cherry Recorders, Clerks, and Store Assistants. Factory Managers on
the other hand organized training in areas of record keeping, coffee processing
and coffee husbandry for their staff in the factories. A few trained their assistants
The following improvements on training were suggested by the farmers and
staff:-
ee Increase number of coffee field days and member education days.
+ Increase number of educational tours for farmers
* Decentralize training venues so as to widen coverage.
* Continuos training for society management committees, other societv sal I
and farmers.
* Increase frequency of training
20



Conclusion:
Continuous training should be undertaken for farmers, society staff and management
committees.
4.7   Best Managed Coffee Society Award Scheme
About 93% of the Secretary Managers reported being happy with the award
scheme, which had motivated societies to improve their management practices.
However Secretary Managers from West of Rift Valley said that they were not
aware of the award scheme. The Secretary Managers who were aware of the
award scheme reported that they were putting the following measures in place in
order to compete effectively future competitions.
*: Improving coffee quality/payment.
*: Intensification of training for coffee farrners, society staff and management
committees.
*? Improving record keeping and management of society operations
: Attempts to achieve timely supply of farn inputs and follow-up to ensure that
farmers apply the inputs to coffee in order to increase production and improve
quality.
Conclusion
The award scheme, which was started on a pilot basis, should be extended to cover other
coffee growing districts. The scheme will greatly motivate coffee societies management
committees to improve management of their societies for the benefit of their members.
4.8    DCO's Suggestions On Sustainability Of SCIP II Services
The DCO's were asked to state their views on how SCIP II services to farmers
could be sustained into the future. Their proposals are indicated below'
4.8.1 IPS Sustainability
The DCO's suggested the following on IPS sustainability
*: Two accounts, i.e. MPA & SOEA be maintained.
e. Operations of CSCRC be strengthened.
* Strict adherence to IPS procedures by enforcing AGM resolutions.
4.8.2 CAPS Sustainabilitv
The DCO's suggested the following on CAPS sustainability
*: Cooperative Bank and Rural SACCO's to establish a revolving fund.
21



SCIP interest rates should be maintained.
* Strengthen and improve CAPS implementation.
* Only beneficiaries of CAPS should be deducted the loans and the interest.
4.8.3  FlJS Sustainability
The DCO's suggested the following on FILS sustainability
*  Cooperative Bank and Rural SACCO's to establish a revolving fund
*: SCIP interest rates should be maintained.
*:- Follow SCIP procedures on input procurement.
4.8.4  CFDS Sustainability
The DCO's suggested the following on CFDS sustainability
*: Avail more funds for this component from donors.
* SCIP interest rates should be maintained .
*: Follow SCIP procurement procedures.
*: Cooperative Bank to continue as a conduit for factory loans to coffee
societies.
4.8.5  Training Sustainability
The DCO's suggested the following on CFDS sustainability.
*: Societies to contribute towards training i.e. cost sharing,.
*: Training needs for each group in the cooperative movement be assessed and
well coordinated.
* Continuous training is necessary as new technical recommendations arc
developed.
4.8.6  Other Suggestions on Sustainability of the SCIP 1I Services
Overall, nearly all the DCO's reported that the project has greatly assisted co-
operative coffee farmers and societies in coffee production. However, thcre '
still need to continue supporting coffee farmers by providing credit and another
project, similar to SCIP 1I should be initiated possibly through donor suppori
Information Technology,liberalization and enactment of the New Co-operall x c
Act, it is necessary that societies be supported to computerize their operations

CHAPTER 5:
5.0.  SUSTAINABILITY OF SCIP 11 SERVICES
5.1   Sustainabilitv of IPS Achievements
Out of 203 coffee societies that were in existence in 1991, 181 were inspected and
134 fulfilled conditions for participation in IPS. However, 105 coffee societies
joined in the first year of implementation. Currently there are a total of 275
coffee societies out of which 177 have adopted the IPS. There is a likelihood of
coffee societies increasing due to splitting of larger.coffee societies. It is therefore
necessary that inspections of books continue in order to bring on board those
societies which are not in [PS.
Secondly, the pre-determination of the ratios to be paid into SOEA and MPA has
to be done annually. It is proposed that under the new Cooperative Societies Act,
the society management committees to undertake this responsibility and if
necessary, assistance of the MOCD staff could be sought. The society's AGM
should ratify the management committee's recommendations. This new procedure
could be incorporated in the society bylaws.
5.2   Sustainability of CAPS Achievements
Kshs. 750 million was disbursed under CAPS. Over 500,000 Farmers from about
240 Societies have benefited from the advance. In addition to the balance of IDA
funds of about Kshs. 400 million currently in the CAPS Revolving Fund (RF), an
additional Kshs. 190 million was provided by the European Union (EU) from the
Stabex Fund.
On cumulative and revolving basis, a total of about Kshs. 3.0 billion has been
disbursed under the CAPS component. The (CAPS) rates (i.e. 20% of the
previous annual payment rate) improved from the initial rate Kshs. 1.50 per kg. to
Kshs.5.00 per Kg due to higher prices realized from coffee sales.
Co-operative Bank is in a position to sustain this activity subject to provision and
identification of a source for additional funds at sustainable interest rates. The nsk
of the same crop being used by societies or CBK to secure other advances and
loans needs careful evaluation.
We support the Coop. Bank's earlier proposal that the CAPS lending to the coffee
cooperative society farmers be made in foreign currency in order to make the
interest rate more competitive and thus maintain the farmers' motivation in
CAPS.
The CAPS has proved popular with the recipients because of its transparencv and
will need to be expanded through training and education to cover all the colfee
cooperative societies.
23



5.3   Sustainabilitv of FILS Achievements
The Farm Input Loans Scheme is a short-term loan (two year) to societies through
the Cooperative Bank at 15% interest per annum. The FILS revolving fund has
about Ksh.300 Million from IDA with an additional injection of Kshs. 425 million
from the Stabex Funds.
A total of Kshs.2 Billion has been disbursed on a revolving fund basis to 124
coffee cooperative societies from the then 17 coffee growing districts.
The procurement system put in place by the project eliminated incidence of abuse
(over procurement, procurement of wrong types, late procurement, overpricing
etc) and has thus ensured the near 100% repayment compliance attained.
Proper loan appraisal and observance of open procurement system will have to be
a conditionally for any loans and advances in order to avoid reversion to the old
past of over procurement, wrong chemical specification and lateness. This is an
area where the Coop. Bank as a lending institution should consider strengthening
or establish dependable farm management services as envisaged at project
appraisal.
5.4   Sustainability of CFDS Achievements
Besides ensuring the development of technically sound factories; economic and
financial appraisal of each coffee factory loan application was carried out by
PCMU Economists to ensure that only viable coffee factory development were
undertaken and credit recoverability guaranteed.
A total of 254 coffee factories contracts worth 706 million were awarded. This
included construction of 23 new factories, resting, renovation and electrification
of 8, 67, 150 factories respectively.
There are 20 coffee factories still under the defects liability period until December
31, 1998.
Capacity for successful supervision of this component was attained through the
training and registration of five SCIP Engineers and six Draftsmen.
Provision of coffee processing management services for the coffee co-operative
societies, and small estates was envisaged and recommended in the Staff
Appraisal Report. The Coop. Bank will continue to monitor the perfonnance of
this component. In order to ensure and maintain good performance, Coop. Bank.
as the Financing institution will require to consider the services of a Coffee
Factory Engineer and Agricultural Economist to appraise the investments.

5.5.  Training
Training component was amongst the first component to be implemented in order
to create staff and farmner's awareness about the project.
TRAINING -Training achievements are as follows:-

The PCMU has reviewed and developed a Training Syllabus applicable to the
entire training programme in the cooperative sub sector. The training programme
has resulted in attainment of better extension services through quick
dissemination of up to date messages on improved coffee production and
processing.
The proposed establishment of a core extension unit within MOCD to be named
Coffee Management Services Unit (CMSU) will provide such other services
mentioned later in this report.
5.5   Small/Medium Coffee Estates (SMCE)
Currently there are 1260 SMCE in the country, with an area of 14,342 hectares
which is about 9% of the total area under coffee. This sector produces about 40°h
of the total output for coffee in the country. The major constraints that affect
increased production in SMCE's are the following: -
* Lack of affordable credit facilities
*S Lack of irrigation facilities
25



Shortage of labour
* Managerial problems
This coffee sub sector did not benefit from SCIP 11. The envisaged financing by
the EU through the STABEX Fund will have to be evaluated by the proposed
CMSU. The financing proposal on SMCE will require to be revised.
5.7   Establishment and Functions of CMSU
To sustain the gains of the Second Coffee Improvement Project (SCIP 11), it is
necessary to establish a core unit on a structure similar to that of former Project
Co-ordination and Management Unit based at the Ministry of Co-operative
Development. The proposed name of the unit is Coffee Management Services
Unit. The option of maintaining the semi autonomous status should be given
immediate consideration to enable the unit perform effective by.
5.7.1  Objective of CMSU
The main function of the Coffee Management Services Unit (CMSU) is to
facilitate co-ordinated development of coffee industry at the national level and to
ensure that farrners get the highest percentage of the gross earnings from coffee
proceeds.
5.7.2 Role of CMSU
i. Sustain the gains of SCIP 11.
ii. Inspect books of coffee societies with a view to admitting them to IPS
participation and other credit schemes and to encourage implementation of the
CSCRC's recommendations.
iii. Assist coffee co-operative societies with implementation of the new Co-
operative Act, (CAP 490) through training.
iv. Co-ordinate Coffee Processing Management and Extension Services to coffee
co-operative societies and small to medium coffee estates (S/MCE).
v. Provide management support for the small and medium coffee estates, and
source for credit through the revision of the SMCE funding proposal.
vi. Develop a cost sharing programme for the services provided by the CMSU such
that the coffee industry shall meet part of the expenses incurred by the second
year, and the same to be revised upwards to the full cost by the seventh vear of
the Unit.
vii. Provide technical assistance to coffee industry's national committees and
programmes (e.g Stabex Funding of Coffee Cooperative Societies; Rural
26



Electrification Programme (COFREP) and Coffee .Rural Access Roads
Committees.
viii. Conduct feasibility studies of coffee factory development and facilitate
supervision of coffee factories development i.e. constructions, renovations and
electrification.
ix. To maintain coffee machinery suppliers and register contractors for the coffee
industry.
x. Maintain a Management Information System (MIS) for the coffee industry.
xi. To co-ordinate and if possible facilitate on the job training of coffee factory
engineers to enable more of them to be registered with the Engineers
Registration Board (ERB) as required by Law Cap 530 to create more capacity
and also make them fully accountable for overseeing coffee factories
development.
xii. On behalf of the government liase with Co-operative Bank of Kenya on the
management of bad debts arising from SCIP I lending.
xiii. Develop a viable programme for the provision of Ruiru 11 planting materials on
commercial basis.
xiv. Continue to encourage good management through competitions annually of the
best managed coffee societies' competition award scheme.
xv. On behalf of the government to ensure proper utilisation of the revolving funds
5.7.3 Structure and Staff Establishment of CMSU
it is proposed that for the CMSU to be able to undertake its responsibilines. the
staff establishment be as follows: -
Head - Deputy Commissioner of Co-operative Development or Deputy Director
of Agriculture
Technical Staff Assisting the Head of CMSU:
Co-operative Specialist        - SACCD         -
Agricultural Specialist        - ADA           -      I
Coffee Factory Engineers       - ADA           -      2

The vehicles and equipment in excess of the above requirement be shared out to
the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Co-operative Development.
5.7.5  Management of CMSU
A working committee similar to the SCIP II Project Steering Committee is
suggested. The proposed name for this committee is National Coffee Steering
Committee (NCSC).
Suggested membership of committee would be as follows: -
Permanent Secretary             -     MOCD (Chairman)
Permanent Secretary             -     MOA  (Altemate Chairman)

The following district level committees, which were created by the project. are
still necessary and it is recommended that they be maintained: -
District Coffee Working Group          (DCWG)
District Loans Advisory Committee     (DLAC)
Coffee Societies Cost Review Committee  (CSCRC)
28



5.7.6 Financial Support
The financial support to CMSU be sourced from: -
(i)    Ministry of Agriculture      -reinstate Development Votes.
(ii)   Ministry of Co-op. Development   -Enhance the allocation.
(iii) Consideration of support from the Stabex Funding and ASIP
(iv)   Consideration of funding supports from the Coffee Board of Kenya.
Concurrence could be sought from EU to the effect that part of the interest earned
from Stabex funds could be allocated to agreed activities of the CMSU. After the
Co-operative Bank recoups interest for their operating expenses, (i.e. 55% of the
15% interest earned from the Stabex revolving fund); a portion of the remaining
45% of the 15% interest which goes to build the revolving fund could be allocated
for support services.
According to the Annual Work Programme for 1998/99, the proposed expenditure
shall be K£600,000 to meet the headquarters, districts and provincial
expenditures. To finance this budget, it is proposed that the contribution of the
above named financing organisations be as follows:-
