THE GAMBIA
AGRICULTURL SERVICES PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower       :   The Gambia
Beneficiais         Farmers and herders, Ministry of Agriculture and National Agricultural Research
Board (NARB)
Amount              SDR 8.8 million (US$12.3 million)
Terms          :   Standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity.
Relending Terms    Part of the proceeds of the Credit would be passed on by Government in grant
form to the National Agricultural Research Board (NARB).
?roject            'MThe project aims to generate increased agricultural productivity and sustained
Description       growth of the incomes of small farming families, through the strengthening of
support services in agricultural extension and research, training and the
promotion of farmer self-reliance and empowerment. The main components of
the project are: (i) strengthening sector analysis and planning capacity of the
Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Natural Resources and the
Environment; (ii) consolidating, improving and strengthening agricultural
extension services covering crop and livestock production and natural resource
management, and expansion of functional literacy programs; (iii) improving and
strengthening the Gambian agricultural research system and modest support to the
Agricultural School of the Gambia College; and (iv) promoting farmer self-
reliance/empowerment through pilot activities in one administrative Division
(McCarthy Island Division - MID) that would test new approaches involving
farmer participation and self-management in the areas of: irrigation water
management, rural savings and loans, training of rural entrepreneurs, and rural
social infrastructure.
Economic Rate   :   Not applicable.
of Return
Beneflit and   :   Benefits: The project will contribute to the well-being of a large number of the
RiUkA            rural population. Most of the 550,000 people in rural areas would benefit from
a more dynamic agricultural education, research and extension system that
continuously generates and diffuses improved agricultural practices. However,
how many of these households would choose to adopt recommended practices
cannot be estimated with any precision. More specifically, project benefits
should manifest themselves in four main areas: (a) increases in production and
productivity of both the crop and livestock sectors in a sustainable manner;
(b) better coordination of delivery of agricultural services within the public and
private sectors (NGOs, farmer organizations); (c) human resources: the project



- ii -
strongly emphasizes training and continuing education programs for farmers,
herders and government staff (approximately 200 staff at various levels); and
(d) institutional development: by converting the Department of Agricultural
Research into a National Agricultural Research Institute and by further
strengthening the capacity of the Department of Agricultural Services, the
Department of Livestock Services, the Department of Planning, and the Gambia
College, the ability of the Ministry of Agriculture to plan, coordinate and deliver
agricultural support services to the farming community will be greatly enhanced.
The project will allow for a more effective system of technology generation and
diffusion and will permit better leadership of other agricultural services, thereby
creating a good opportunity to streamline donor financial assistance.
Risks: The risks foreseen, which are common to similar projects supported by
IDA, include: (i) ineffective management of research and extension personnel;
(ii) low adoption rates of technical recommendations by farmers and/or slow
build-up of applicable technology by research, especially given its dependence
on outside sources of technology and information; and (iii) the possible failure
of Government and/or donors to sustain the long-term commitment required to
achieve durable improvements in the effectiveness of agricultural support
services. To minimize these risks, lessons learned under the IDA financed
Second Agricultural Development Project, IFAD funded agricultural projects,
and a USAID supported research project have been built into the project design.
The management of agricultural extension and research services is expected to
improve as a result of the training, technical assistance, improved organization
and monitoring and evaluation provided by the project. The previous project has
shown that appropriate technologies are available for extension to farmers, and
that there is room for considerable improvements in food crop and livestock
production as well as in better natural resource management, since many of the
country's farmers and herders, especially women, have not previously had access
to extension advice. The project also focusses on the pre-extension testing of a
sizeable body of existing research results, both within the country and abroad,
and on strengthening research linkages with the outside world. Finally, the
annual review of work programs and budgets, as well as the mid-term
implementation review, will provide good opportunities for program review and
long-term commitment building.

AGRICULTUJRAIL SERVICFS PRO.lECT
STAF1F APPRAISAL REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
A. Introduction
1.01         Under the Second Agricultural Development Project (ADP-II, Credit 1476-GM, closing
date June 1993), co-financed with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and Italy,
significant progress has been achieved in building up a professional crop extension service. However,
much remains to be done to improve effectiveness of the services, to improve linkages with research, to
integrate livestock extension and natural resources management practices into one polyvalent extension
service, and to generalize extension to women farmers. During the same period (1985-92), the USAID-
funded Gambia Agricultural Research and Diversification (GARD) Project has made big strides in
improving the Gambia Agricultural Research System (GARS). Funding for this project was assured until
July 1, 1992. Continued funding is being provided under the ADP-II Credit. IFAD has funded the Jahally
Pachar Smallholder (irrigation) Project (JPSP) which will be closed soon. This project, covering The
Gambia's largest irrigation scheme, was successful in providing modern irrigation technology to
smallholder farmers. However, its sustainability would need to be assured by transferring scheme
management to the water users. The Government, fully aware of the need to sustain its support for
extension, research and increased self-reliance of the rural population, has requested in 1990 World Bank
assistance in the preparation of a project that would cover these priority areas. Early in 1991 an FAO/CP
mission visited The Gambia to prepare such a project. A World Bank pre-appraisal mission visited The
Gambia in October 1991. The project was appraised by a joint World Bank/IFAD mission in April and
May of 1992.
B. The Aricultural Sector
1.02         Agriculture currently accounts for some 25% of GDP; it provides employment for more
than 75% of the labor force, and it is the principal means of livelihood for the rural population.
Population density is high - with 90 inhabitants/km2 of agricultural land, and population growth rate is
over 3% p.a. It is estimated that the area harvested averages about 160,000 ha, or some 40% of the
country's suitable agricultural land. Nearly all of it is rainfed and only about 1,000 ha are pump-irrigated,
although rice is also grown on some additional 10 - 20, 000 ha of uplands, mangrove swamps and in
freshwater tidal areas. The predominant production system is traditional shifting, slash and burn
cultivation, that requires a substantial area for fallow and recovery.. The increasing population pressure
is gradually reducing the fallow period, leading to more continuous cropping and soil degradation. The
direct economic and other consequences of this environmental degradation are being increasingly felt.
However, agricultural production so far shows no clear trend. Crop output continues to be primarily a
function of weather and yearly fluctuations can be as high as 40 %. Livestock production on the other
hand has continuously increased over the last six years. To reduce yearly fluctuations in production and
to maintain agricultural productivity, increased attention wDI have to be given to soil fertility and moisture
management, erosion control and development of tidal irrigation.



1.03         The principal crops grown are: groundnuts, millet, sorghum, swamp rice, maize, and
upland rice. Minor crops are cotton (2,000 ha) and vegetables (800 ha). Productivity, although better
than in drier areas of the Sahel, is generally low due to the low fertility of most of the agricultural soils.
Both the areas planted and yields vary considerably from year to year due primarily to fluctuations in
rainfall and changes in the profitability of individual commodities'. The sector is heavily dependent on
groundnuts, which account for 95% of export earnings. While irrigated rice development is constrained
by natural factors (salinity of the Gambia river due to tidal intrusion of sea water), vegetable growing has
greatly increased in the last several years stimulated by NGO investments. In the Banjul area vegetables
are also grown for exports.
1.04         Livestock is also important, as about 15-20% of the rural population owns cattle, and
almost all farm compounds keep some sheep, goats and poultry. The national herd has recently been
estimated to be as follows: 280,000 heads of cattle, 120,000 sheep, 180,000 goats, 15,300 horses, and
36,500 donkeys. The present stocking rate of about 70 heads of cattle per sq. km is considerably higher
than the generally accepted carrying capacity of 50 heads per sq. km. in the Sahel. When sheep and
goats are included, the density is much higher and the pressure on the grazing lands is a major factor in
land degradation. All livestock are kept under traditional husbandry systems, and productivity is
generally low. To date, no significant modern poultry producing units exist largely because of the cost
of imported animal feed and problems in obtaining supplies of day-old chicks.
1.05         Forest cover is decreasing and today only 175,000 ha or 17% of the total land area can
be considered as wooded. The quality of the stand and the canopy cover have deteriorated as a
consequence of logging, land clearing, firewood collection and burning. The rate of firewood
consumption exceeds the annual growth increment of the remaining national forest, and the country has
to import 95 % of its construction timber requirements. Massive deforestation has resulted in soil erosion,
excessive runoff and in the extinction of animal species. Hunting is no longer an important source of
protein for the rural population. To deal with these problems, GOTG has laid the legal foundation for
subsequent action with the passage of the National Environmental Management Act, created the Ministry
of Natural Resources and the Environment (MNRE), and is in the process of preparing a national
environmental action plan (see para. 1.08).
1.06         The family unit is the main source of labor supply. Although reliable statistics are not
available, the use of animal traction (oxen, donkeys and horses) has been reported to be increasing and
at present, it is estimated that over 95% of the coarse grain and groundnut area is prepared using animal
traction (National Agricultural Sample Survey, 1990).  Land tenure and allocation practices are
traditional. Compounds are generally divided into one or more production units (dabadas) and
consumption units (sinkiros). All dabada members are expected to contribute to family food production,
the ultimate responsibility for which lies with the dabada head. Men are traditionally responsible for
producing upland crops (millet, sorghum, maize) and women, primarily for swamp rice, the country's
main staple. For cash income, men produce groundnuts and sell a portion of their upland crops. Women
are also involved in groundnut production and are virtually the exclusive producers of horticultural corps
and sesame. It is estimated that 75% of the population is illiterate.
I/    Average yields over the last ten years were: groundnut - 1.3 t/ha, millet - 1.0 t/ha, sorghum
- 0.9 t/ha, maize - 1.4 t/ha, upland rice - 1.0 t/ha, and swamp rice - 1.3 t/ha.



1.07         Women play a prominent role in the Gambian farming system, providing between 30%
and 50% of the total agricultural labor. Gender-specific responsibilities vary according to village
location, ethnicity, and the level of farm mechanization. Farming activities are generally more separated
in lowland villages, where mutual assistance between men and women is less common and where woiner,
spend more time on farming than do those in upland villages. In upland farming, there is a considerable
amount of labor exchange, with men often helping women with the heavier tasks such as land clearing
and when animal traction is used for plowing, planting and weeding. Women, in turn, provide most of
the labor for harvesting and are responsible for post-harvest processing of cereals, one of the most time-
consuming and arduous tasks of rural women. Both men and women produce food for household
consumption (maruo crops), which is usually done collectively; both also grow crops for their personal
use (kamanyango crops), a large proportion of which is sold. More than half of the women of working
age cultivate their own kamanyango fields. Women are practically the sole producers of swamp and tidal
rice, horticultural crops, and sesame, and they also own and manage a large proportion of the country's
sheep, goat and poultry stock.
C. Government and Bank Strategv in the Sector
1.08         Government's strategy in the agricultural sector under the Bank supported Economic
Recovery Program (ERP) has been to create and maintain an environment conducive to growth and
economic efficiency.  Specifically, the strategy is to encourage increased efficiency in groundnut
production, diversification into other cash crops, and increases of production of food crops.
Implementation has relied on flexible pricing policies, expansion of the role of the private sector in output
marketing and input supply, and provision of credit for inputs on market terms. The Ministry of
Agriculture has been restructured to focus on support activities, primarily extension services, research,
policy analysis and agricultural statistics. Input prices and prices for agricultural products are market
determined. At the same time and to preserve the natural resource base, in 1987 GOTG passed the
National Environmental Management Act and established in 1990 the Ministry of Natural Resources and
the Environment (MNRE). MNRE is to coordinate government services and has started to prepare an
Environmental Action Plan, which will be presented to a donor conference in Banjul, planned for
January 1992.
1.09         IDA, in close collaboration with GOTG and other donors, is supporting the above
strategy, with strong emphasis on the reinforcement of agricultural services, natural resources
management, and farmers' participation. A new partnership between the public sector institutions and
the farming community will be encouraged. The emphasis will be on having the right agricultural
policies in place, and on mobilizing the energy, knowledge, and resources of local people and enhancing
their understanding of agricultural technology and natural resources management techniques. Public
sector institutions are to become much more professional and act in a service mode. The proposed
project would be a vehicle for this strategy and would complement the USAID National Resources
Support Project, which is currently being prepared. The joint involvement of IDA and IFAD would
create a better opportunity for obtaining and streamlining both internal and external financing, provide
continuity and would allow improving efficiency in the use of public resources and ensuring an
appropriate balance between capital and recurrent spending.

D. Lessons from Past Arcultural Project Lending. especally ADP-II
1.10         IDA has financed three projects in the rural sector and the Women in Development
Project which has an agricultural component. The Agricultural Development Project (Cr. 333-GM,
US$1.3 million, 1972) developed 500 ha of double cropped irrigated rice. The second operation was the
Rural Development Project (RDP) (Credit 644-GM), the total cost of which was US$11.7 million,
financed by IDA, UK (ODA), and BADEA. The project became effective in November 1976, and closed
in March 1982. It aimed to increase cereal and cash crop production and livestock husbandry of about
48,000 farmers living in 65 selected villages through the introduction of proven package programs for
crop production supported by better coordinated and strengthened Government services, and improved
communications and marketing. The third operation was the Agricultural Development Project II - ADP-
II (Credit 1476-GM, US$9.4 million, effectiveness date 11/07/84). ADP-II had as principal objectives:
(i) consolidation of positive results achieved under the RDP project; (ii) assistance to government with
major sectoral reforms; and (iii) overall increase in production of upland crops through the strengthening
of support institutions, improved input supply, improved research and improved seed multiplication. The
fourth operation is the Women in Development Project (Credit 2141-GM, US$7.0 million, effectiveness
date 12/27/90). This project has an agricultural pilot component that seeks to increase women's
agricultural productivity through the strengthening of agricultural extension services to better serve
women; private sector input distribution; support for women's cooperative groups; strengthening of food
storage, preservation and nutrition extension; improved management of small-scale post-harvest
equipment; and a savings mobilization campaign directed at women.
1.11         Under the first project, the Agricultural Development Project, the impact was mixed.
The performance was generally good in physical achievements and the Gambian Produce Marketing
Board satisfactorily carried out its role of importer and supplier of fertilizers to the project area.
However, project performance was not good in several other areas. The expatriate Project Coordinator
was unable to maintain adequate local commitment during project implementation. The civil works which
were financed by ODA had a cost overrun of 228%. The project did not include support for rainfed
cereals (sorghum and millet). A viable cooperative system to handle credit, input supply and marketing
of output was not achieved.
1.12         The lessons learned from the second project, the Rural Development Project, were as
follows: (i) there is need for more local involvement in the planning stages to ensure adequate
commitment during implementation; (ii) the promotion of women's farming activities is important; (iii)
more attention should be given to the selection and training of suitable extension workers; (iv) there is
a lack of adequate management and administration expertise in Gambia; (v) Gambia Cooperative Union
(GCU) and the primary cooperative societies require much more attention than was given in RDP; there
is need to strengthen and financially rehabilitate the cooperatives to enable them to handle input supply,
credit and marketing more effectively; and (vi) there is need to limit recurrent costs after project
completion, since Government could not provide sufficient recurrent fnance to sustain the level of
development achieved under RDP.
1.13         The third project, ADP-II is still ongoing and success with strengthening of the
Department of Agricultural Services' (DAS) extension activities has been considerable, although
continuous improvements are necessary to increase extension impact. An understanding of, and the
administrative infrastructure for a national crop extension service based on T&V principles has been
established. Also, the reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture was a success. The reorganization
resulted in the reduction of staff (about 400 out of a total of about 1,500 persons) and the strengthening



of the Ministry as an agricultural services institution. However, the agricultural credit component is not
achieving its institution building objectives. After the introduction by the Gambia Cooperative Union
(GCU) of village based lending in 1987, recoveries of short term and medium term loans were initially
satisfactory. However, during the 1990/91 season they fell again to about 50% and it is now clear that
the financial viability of GCU's credit operations can only be addressed as part of a global effort to deal
with the banking system as a whole.
1.14         Although the credit for the fourth project, the WID proje, only became effective in
December 1990, experience with several of the agricultural sub-components has been positive. The
outlook and operating procedures of the DAS crop extension service are changing and many more women
farmers are being reached. The diagnostic skills of extension agents have been improved to identify
gender specific constraints and new technologies have been identified that are of special interest and use
to women farmers. The proposed project will build on these achievements, mainstream the focus on
women and thereby spread the benefits to women beyond the 200 target villages of the WID project
throughout the country.
H. AGRICULTURAL INSTffUTIONS AND SUPPORT SERVICES
A. Agricultural Institutions
Ministry of Agriculture and Related Institutions
2.01         The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) is the main institution responsible for agricultural
development. It was reorganized in 1987; staff was reduced; some services, such as tractor plowing,
animal health care and the leather tannery, were privatized; and a central management unit and four
operational departments were established (see Organizational Charts in Annex 10).
2.02         Central Management Unit. This unit is responsible for the overall strategic management
of the Ministry and coordinating operational activities. It consists essentially of the Permanent Secretary,
his two Deputies in charge of Programs/Projects and Administration, and the Director of the Department
of Planning (DOP).
2.03         Department of Planning (DOP). This department provides policy advice to the Minister,
and helps in identifying and preparing agricultural investment programs and projects. It collects extensive
agricultural data and its national agricultural data center every year conducts a national agricultural sample
survey and presents a statistical yearbook of Gambian agriculture. In addition, it monitors ongoing
investment operations and does selected evaluation studies.
2.04         Department of Agricultural Services (DAS). This department is responsible for providing
crop extension services to farmers. The total staff of the Department is 420. The HQ of the DAS in St.
Mary's consists of the director, an assistant director, an executive officer, two crop protection officers,
two accounts clerks and support staff. The director reports to the permanent secretary of the MOA and
also to the Deputy P.S. in his capacity as ADP-II project coordinator. In turn, the director is responsible
for the six Divisional Agricultural Offices (DAOs), and 25 District Extension Centers (DECs), the
Agricultural Communications Unit (ACU), the Crop Protection Service, the Soil and Water Management
Unit (SWMU), and the Food and Nutrition Unit (FNU).



- 6 -
2.05         Department of Livestock Services (DLS). This department is presently responsible for
control of notifiable diseases, meat inspection and livestock extension and research.  It also has
responsibility for the Livestock Marketing Board, the tannery and veterinary services, pending
privatization. It also retains responsibility for livestock research, pending transfer of research to the
Department of Agricultural Research or its successor organization (para. 3.17). DLS has a total staff of
210.
2.06         Department of Cooperation.  This department has responsibility for promotion of
cooperative societies, provision of advice to members and gathering information on demand for inputs,
market trends and training needs.
2.07         Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment. This Ministry was created in 1990
to improve coordination of government actions in this area. Its two main units are: the Environment
Unit and the Planning Units. The Ministry is charged with overseeing the implementation of the Gambia
Environmental Action Plan.
2.08         The Gambia Agricultural Research System - (GARS). The Gambia Agricultural Research
System is composed of a number of institutions, primarily the Departmnent of Agricultural Research
(DAR), the Department of Livestock Services (DLS), and the National Agricultural Research Board
(NARB). The DAR, created in 1988 following the reorganization of MOA, is responsible for crop
research. The DLS is responsible for animal production research and DOP provides support for research
in social sciences. Staff from the Departments of Water Resources (DWR), Fisheries (DFISH), Forestry
(DFOR) and Wildlife (DWLIFE) within the ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE) are
responsible for research in their areas of specialization. The NARB was established in 1988 to advise on
research priorities for all agriculture, livestock and natural resources management research. In practice,
NARB only provided oversight for research done by DAR and DLS, since the other departments did not
have full-time scientific staff. Some adaptive research (variety introduction and testing) is being done by
NGOs. Catholic Relief Services (CRS), the Good Seed Mission (GSM) and the Methodist Mission (MM)
have been particularly active in this respect. The International Trypanotolerance Center (ITC), located
near Banjul, was created in 1982 to carry out studies to exploit trypanotolerance for agricultural,
commercial and food production purposes and to conduct research.
2.09         The Gambia College. Gambia College was established in 1978 by joining together four
existing schools viz. The School of Agriculture, The School of Education, The School of Public Health,
and The School of Nursing and Midwifery. The School of Agriculture offers a two-year certificate course
in general agriculture, which is an upgrading program for field staff of the Department of Agricultural
Services. It also provides a two-year certificate course for livestock assistants of the Department of
Livestock Services. Furthermore, it offers a three-year course leading to the Higher Diploma in
Agriculture. Its graduates work mostly as extension agents either for DAS/DLS or NGOs. The school
also provides short term in-service training for the upgrading of extension agents. The school operates
a demonstration and teaching farm on up-land soils partly under sprinkler irrigation. It also has a few
hectares of gravity irrigated low-land soils.
2.10         The Gambian Cooperative Union (GCU) Ltd. This is the lead organization for some 55
primary Cooperative Produce Marketing Societies (CPMS), with a total membership of approximately
80,000 farmers. The GCU is a licensed buying agent for the Gambia Produce Marketing Board (GPMB).
The CPMS buy produce, principally groundnuts, from members and supply production inputs, which are
often supplied on credit. The GCU is, therefore, the principal formal rural credit system in the Gambia.



- 7 -
2.11         The Gambia Produce Marketing Board (GPMB). This is a parastatal organization with
responsibility for marketing groundnuts, and until recently for rice and cotton, for importing rice, and
for operating paddy processing facilities. Under the ongoing Program for Sustained Development (PSD),
the GPMB is scheduled for privatization, and USAID is assisting GOTG in finding potential buyers.
2.12          Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). There are estimated to be some 100 local and
overseas-based NGOs operating in the Gambia. A number of the larger ones such as Action Aid The
Gambia (AATG); Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and Save the Children (SCF-USA) have active
agricultural sections.  Typically these NGOs concentrate on a particular activity such as seed
multiplication (eg. The Good Seed Mission) or the promotion of a new crop (eg. Catholic Relief Service -
CRS and sesame) or women's horticultural gardens. However, many NGOs also provide general
agricultural advice to the communities in which they work, often by recruiting the best extension staff
from the MOA by offering them attractive benefits. Registered NGOs have formed an inter-NGO entity,
The Association of Non-Govermnental Organizations (TANGO). Coordination of governmental and NGO
activities is the responsibility of the Advisory Committee for the Coordination of Non-Governmental
Organizations (ACCNO). NGOs, particularly those that have been operating in the country for some
time, have made significant contributions to the Gambia's development efforts not only by complementing
the government services, but also by playing an innovative and demonstration role.
B. Aericultural and Livestock Extension
2.13         Crop and livestock extension services are the responsibility of the Department of
Agricultural Services (DAS) and the Department of Livestock Services (DLS), respectively. At present
little coordination and/or cooperation between the two departments exist.
2.14         The Director of DAS is assisted by the assistant director whose specific responsibilities
are agricultural extension and linkage with the Department of Agricultural Research (DAR). At the
divisional and district level, extension is supervised and implemented by the six Divisional Agricultural
Officers (DAOs) and 25 District Extension Centers (DECs). Each DAO consists of a divisional
agricultural coordinator (DAC), an assistant divisional agricultural coordinator (ADAC), two subject
matters specialists (SMSs)--crop protection and crop production-and a training officer (TO). The DAOs
are located at strategic positions within each division and consist of staff housing, offices, stores and a
classroom. The majority of DAC staff have the equivalent of a 3 year college diploma either from the
Gambia College or from training colleges in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria or Sierra Leone. The 25 DECs are
headed by District Extension Supervisors (DES), who supervise a number of VEW. At each operational
DEC there are also two Animal Traction Instructors (ATIs) who are responsible for training draught
animals for land preparation.
2.15         The Director of DLS is assisted by the assistant director whose specific responsibility is
to oversee the field operations of the Department. At the divisional level, there is one Chief Veterinary
Officer assisted by field staff (livestock assistants). These livestock assistants have a two year certificate
course from the Gambia College and their primary tasks are the treatment of animal diseases and the
annual vaccination campaign. Livestock assistants work basically with little or no systematic supervision
and backstopping from higher level staff. They do not provide extension advice on animal husbandry
practices, unless as part of a specific donor financed project. Under the proposed project, this situation
will be changed and DLS will introduce a time-bound work plan for the livestock assistants (see
para. 3.10).

2.16         While extension advice on crops by DAS has had considerable impact on the adoption
and diffusion of new technologies (see Annex lb), efforts to address the following issues are needed:
higher-level training of extension staff, the selection of target groups, the broadening of extension
messages to cover also livestock and natural resources management aspects as well as post-harvest
conservation techniques and market information, and increasing the number of farmers being reached by
extension. In the past, access of women to information on new and improved production technologies was
limited. Extension agents tended to work primarily with male farmers. However, this situation is
improving. Under the Bank-financed Women in Development Project and ADP-II, measures have been
taken to reorient extension activities towards women farmers and the number of women contact farmers
has increased dramatically from 5% to over 30% in two years. Also, new extension messages of special
interest to women in the areas of post-harvest technology and food processing have been added.
C. Agricultural Research
2.17         Research Infrastructure. DAR operates two experiment stations, one near Yundum in the
coastal area where its headquarters and central laboratories are located, and one at Sapu approximately
300 km to the East, which also includes a small pump-irrigated low-land site along the Gambia River.
The Yundum station is scheduled to be relocated with ADP-II funding to a site adjacent to The Gambia
College. The rationale for the transfer of the Yundum experiment station to a site adjacent to the school
is =  the possible sharing of equipment and facilities, with the possible exception of the workshop, but
rather the sharing of staff, which would enhance both the teaching and the research capacity. DLS
operates one research site at Yorro Berri Kunda (YBK), in the vicinity of Sapu; its office facilities and
some minor laboratory space are located at Abuko near Yundum. ITC has three research sites with fully
operational housing and laboratory facilities and pastures; one at the coast (Kerr Seringe), which also
includes its headquarters, one at about 150 km East (Kenaba) and the third one approximately 300 km



- 9 -
East at Bansang, i.e., close to both YBK and Sapu. Most of the on-station research and testing by CRS
is done at its Nemankuku Nursery.
2.18         Research Programs. DAR currently has six research programs, including: cropping
systems/resource management (CSRM), rice, horticulture, upland cereals, grain legumes/oil seeds and
agricultural engineering/animal traction. Achievements are mainly in the areas of: crop density, soil
fertility management strategies (FAO Fertilizer Use Project), the introduction of higher yielding maize
varieties (maize production in The Gambia has significantly increased in recent years), the introduction
of pest resistant varieties of coarse grains and short-cycle varieties of groundnuts, horticultural marketing
(FAO Horticultural Project), mechanization of rice production in inland valleys and the adaptation of low-
lift pumping equipment (FAO Agricultural Mechanization Project). A feature that distinguishes GARS
from many research systems in the Sahel is its emphasis on on-farm research (testing) in collaboration
with the extension services and NGOs, and its almost total dependence on technology generated
elsewhere. The testing of technology with the direct participation of farmers is done as part of the
'Farmer Innovation Testing Technology - FITT" program. DAR also operates the Seed Technology Unit
(STU), located at the Sapu station, which is responsible for the production of foundation seed, quality
control and seed certification, and the promotion of seed multiplication by farmers under contract; the
latter in collaboration with Winrock International and with support from ODA.
2.19         Animal production research by DLS has in the past focused on range and feed
management. With its limited capacity, it is more recently focussing on experimenting with market-
oriented sheep fattening for Tabaski in collaboration with CRS. Results so far are very promising. NGO
managed research, mainly by CRS, has been particularly successful with the on-farm testing and
introduction of sesame, sunflower, cowpea, cassava, findo and rainy season vegetable varieties. ITC's
initial research focused on the productivity and breeding of The Gambia's famous trypano-resistant
N'Dama cattle. More recently the institute broadened the scope of its research to also include: livestock
systems, small ruminants (goats and sheep) and animal traction.
2.20         Research - Extension - Farmer Linkage. A feature that distinguishes GARS from many
research systems in the Sahel is its emphasis on on-farm research (testing) in collaboration with the
extension services and NGOs, and its quasi-total dependence on technology generated elsewhere. In the
context of the GARD project, DAR established in 1986 the Research/Extension Liaison Unit (RELU) and
created the position of Research/Extension Liaison Officer (RELO). In 1989, RELU in collaboration with
CSRM initiated a program of Farmer Innovation and Technology Testing (FITT). This program proved
to be highly successful and a source for creating a "bondage" between research and extension staff around
a common objective. Finally, Assistant Directors in DAS and DAR have been given explicit
responsibility to oversee research/extension linkages.
2.21         Human Resources (Research Capacity). The Government operated components of GARS,
i.e., under NARB oversight, employs 43 scientists, of which eight are expatriates (six with DAR and one
with DLS). However, taking into account the multitude of administrative and extension tasks that
scientists in a small system have to undertake in addition to their scientific work, one estimates that only
20 person years are available for research.  The distribution of scientists over the different
activities/Departments is as follows: crops (DAR) 24; livestock (DLS) 10; social sciences (DOP) 2;
forestry (DFOR) 1; fisheries (DFISH) 1; and water resources (DWR) 5. Sixty three percent of the
Gambian scientists have the equivalent of a masters degree, only one holds a PhD.



- 10-
2.22         Agricultural Research Constraints. Continuity in the generation of new or improved
technologies, together with policies conducive to sustainable agricultural growth, are the two cornerstones
for a healthy development of the agricultural sector. The generation of agricultural technology in The
Gambia is constrained by:
(i)   inadequacies in the linkages of the system with external (neighboring countries, sub-
regional and international) sources of technology, GARS being too small to generate its
own technologies;
(ii)   irregular funding of research operating expenditures and experiment station maintenance
and operation, jeopardizing the sustainability of the system;
(iii)  inadequacies in human resources development and management, leading to unacceptably
high staff turnover rates, inadequate staff incentives, and insufficient accountability for
research results; and
(iv)   inadequate public sector institutional arrangements, which may be the most important
bottleneck preventing the system from becoming sustainable.
These are the issues the proposed project intends to address.
D. Agricultural Credit
2.23         Agricultural credit to small farmers is provided chiefly by GCU. Commercial banks are
reluctant to provide credit to them (they do, however, provide credit to large commercial farmers)
because of risk involved and high cost. Increasingly, credit is also provided by NGOs and under
development projects financed by other donors. GCU still is, however, the principal source of formal
rural credit in The Gambia, although its importance is declining rapidly.
2.24         Established some 25 years ago, GCU experienced in the mid 1980's severe problems and
repayment rates declined to unacceptable levels. Under ADP-II, during 1987/88 - 1989/90, considerable
improvements were achieved in the operational efficiency of the GCU. In particular the previous system
whereby loans were screened by the CPMS Executive Committee and approved by the GCU, was
replaced by a system under which loans were screened by Loan Committees at the Village Branch level
of each CPMS. This led initially to a dramatic improvement in loan recovery rates. However, during
1991/92 season credit recovery fell to 50% and the future of GCU as a credit institution is in doubt. The
Government, with donor assistance, is in the process of defining an institutional, regulatory, supervisory
and legal framework for rural financial market operations. Within this framework, village savings and
loan associations will be encouraged. One such promising initiative is the Village Savings and Loans
Associations (VISACAS) operating in the Maccarthy Island Division. They were created in 1988 through
external interventions by a French NGO - Centre International de De'veloppement et de Recherche
(CIDR), with funding from the German Kreditanstaltftr Wiederaujbau (KfW). VISACAS have been
highly successful in building-up people's capacity to manage their own small village banks, mobilizing
savings and ensuring credit recovery. The proposed project would support further development of this
highly participatory concept.

E. Functional Literacy
2.25         The Department of Non-Formal Education (DNFE) of the Ministry of Education is
responsible for dealing with adult illiteracy throughout the country. The DNFE has a staff of 27 at its
HQ in Banjul and a Program Officer in each of the six divisions who train personnel involved in DNFE
(including NGOs). They also train facilitators in the villages - these facilitators are volunteers. DNFE
designs and produces materials for Adult Literacy Classes and coordinates the activities of all DNFE
Programs in the country. The DNFE services are composed of four sections: the Directorate; Literature
Division; Field Programming Division, and a Print Unit. The Literature Division has three sub-units,
each with a staff of two, at Mandinka, Pulaar and Wolof, respectively. The Field Programming Division
has eight staff, of which five are posted in the divisions.
F. Farmers' Oreanizations
2.26         In The Gambia, basically two types of social organizations exist in rural areas: traditional
groupings based on age and gender, called kafos and recently introduced organizations, such as producer
organizations (i.e., maize growers association, livestock producers association), local NGOs, and village
development committees. In the past, development projects financed by external donors mostly ignored
these traditional rural organizations and did not build upon them and strengthen them. Only recently have
donors realized the importance of these groupings and recognized their potential for self-management and
sustainable indigenous development. Under the WID project, women kafos are encouraged to register
under appropriate existing legislation to have better access to resources. Through its involvement with
irrigation development projects, IFAD also has come to the conclusion that irrigation investments to
become economically viable and in order to be able to introduce intermediate technology need to be
managed by the users themselves. DAS on its part is analyzing ways to have extension agents work more
closely with kafos.  The project will support these efforts to bring about much greater farmer
participation. These efforts are all the more important as the role of Government in rural development
is changing and functions previously the responsibility of Government are to be assumed by the rural
population itself.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Rationale
3.01         Agriculture is likely to remain the principal economic activity of the majority of the rural
population and raising agricultural output is the most efficient way of raising rural incomes. The
agricultural pricing policy adopted under the Economic Recovery Program (ERP) is beginning to provide
adequate financial incentives for farmers to raise the output of most of the major crops and the most
effective way to assist in the development of the rural economy is to ensure the generation and adoption
of improved production technologies by small farmers. Under ADP-II a T&V inspired crop extension
service has been established, and there is evidence that some 30% of farmers are directly reached by
extension staff and that proposed technologies are being widely adopted (Annex lb). An adequate
physical infrastructure now exists together with a well defined and understood management structure.
Also, an adequate number of tested technologies are available that can be recommended to farmers and
new technologies are being worked on (see Annex 2). However, there is considerable scope for further



- 12 -
improvements. In-service training needs to become much more regular and key staff need further
academic training in agriculture, extension, and general management techniques. Also, operational
constraints linked to the mobility of extension staff remain. These constraints must be eliminated before
the service can be expected to function reliably. Furthermore, there is a crucial need to provide farmers
with comprehensive extension advice on crops, livestock and natural resources management and to
organize service delivery by DAS and DLS accordingly. In addition, recent efforts to increase the number
of women farmers benefitting directly from extension (para. 2.16) need to be continued and the capacity
of extension agents to deal with gender issues needs to be improved. Finally, agricultural research needs
continuous strengthening to sustain the extension effort.  Experience elsewhere indicates that the
development of an operationally effective national research and extension service can take up to 15 years.
In The Gambia, the process of developing a modest research capacity and establishing a professional
system of extension is still in its infancy. Given present limits on government budgetary resources, this
process requires further external support for its consolidation and continued development.
B. Summary Description
3.02         The project aims at generating increased agricultural productivity and sustained growth
of the incomes of small farming families, through the strengthening of support services in agricultural
extension, research, and training, and the promotion of self-reliance and farmer empowerment. In this,
the project would build on experience gained during the implementation of the ADP-II, GARD and JPSP
projects. The main components of the project are:
(i)    strengthening natural resources/agricultural sector analysis and planning;
(ii)   consolidating, improving and strengthening agricultural extension services covering crop
and livestock production and natural resources management, and expansion of functional
literacy programs;
(iii)  improving and strengthening the Gambian agricultural research system and modest
support to the Agricultural School of the Gambia College; and
(iv)   promoting self-reliance/farmer empowerment through pilot activities in one administrative
Division (MacCarthy Island Division - MID) that would test new approaches in farmer
participation and self-management in the areas of: irrigation water management, rural
savings and loans, training of rural entrepreneurs, and rural social infra-structure.
The project would be implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Agricultural Research
Board.
C. Detailed Features
Strengthening Agricultural Sector Analysis and Planning
3.03         To improve the limited policy-making, investment-screening and performance-monitoring
capacity of DOP in MOA and the Planning Unit in MNRE, the project will provide professional support
and staff training for the following three main tasks:



- 13 -
(a)   the formulation of development policies in agriculture and natural resources management,
the analysis of factors affecting the demand and supply of inputs and outputs, and the
definition of the respective functions of public and private actors and of sub-sectoral
priorities for public investment;
(b)    appraisal and consistency checking of investment proposals prepared in the technical
departments; and
(c)    monitoring of performance of public agencies and projects responsible for implementation
of rural development activities.
3.04         The project will finance incremental operating costs of DOP/MOA and the Planning
Unit/MNRE over the project period. This financing will cover: (i) a support contract with an external
institution/university for the provision of short-term consultancy services on demand, (ii) staff training
(short-term and at the graduate level - 3 BSc and 2 MSc), (iii) equipment and equipment maintenance
(vehicles, computers, software and other office facilities); (iv) workshops and networking activities, and
(v) construction of office space for the Environment Unit of MNRE. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained that before the end of December 1993, DOP/MOA would sign a contract with an external
institution or university that will provide professional support to the Department (para. 6.01 (i)).
Strenathening of Extension Services and Expansion of Functional Literacy
3.05         Extension. DAS crop extension operations will be further supported to institutionalize
the new approach developed under ADP-II and to continuously improve the quality of its services.
Special emphasis will be given to software aspects: extension planning, programming, and monitoring;
development of extension recommendations covering not only crop production, protection and storage,
but also animal husbandry, natural resources management practices and farming systems' aspects;
diagnostic studies; use of mass media; research/extension/farmer linkages, collaboration with NGOs and
farmer organizations; and in-service training of staff at all levels. In addition, extension management
would be further decentralized, enabling the DECs to function largely independently in diagnosing local
farmer problems and in defining appropriate extension strategies and recommendations. Also, the
capacity of regional staff to deal with sociological aspects such as selection of contact farmers/contact
groups and gender issues will be enhanced through short term consultancy support (3 man/months).
Finally, extension activities will be closer coordinated with other policy instruments and a comprehensive
long-term manpower development plan will be put in place.
3.06         In view of the critical importance of natural resources management, the outreach activities
of DAS/SWCU would be greatly enhanced to deal countrywide with soil conservation measures on
individual farmers' fields and to advise on community based land management plans. For the latter,
SWMU would form two multi-disciplinary teams of engineers, agronomists and social scientists to help
communities to develop such plans.
3.07         To implement the Environmental Action Plan (EAP), scheduled to be presented to a donor
round table in January 1993, a series of country-wide ecological/environmental surveys and inventories
are proposed to be undertaken to provide the underpinning for the design of GOTG natural resources
management plans. Most of these surveys are already scheduled to be funded by other donors (mainly
USAID). However, some of the proposed inventories, the results of which are expected to directly
impact the activities of DAS/SWCU, have not yet found support from other donors and are therefore



- 14 -
included for financing under the present project. These surveys include: (i) a range land inventory, and
(ii) a study of river flow and saline intrusion in the river Gambia. The first survey is of particular
importance for the establishment of village land management plans. The results of the investigations on
the intrusion of saline water are of crucial importance for the management of existing and future irrigation
schemes. Apparently, areas recovered for pump irrigation upstream, are lost downstream because of
saline intrusion. Tidal low-land gravity irrigation does not seem to affect such intrusion to the same
extent. MNRE would have first responsibility for implementation of these surveys, but detailed terms
of reference, mode of execution and administrative arrangements would be included in the formal
agreements to be concluded with MOA (para. 4.01). These agreements would also include arrangements
for support to the Environmental Unit (EU) in MNRE, including the construction of offices and a
laboratory for pesticide control included in the EAP.
3.08          DLS objectives and activities will be reoriented to include extension responsibilities.
Extension will become part of the regular activities of the Department and not be limited to specific
project interventions. The field staff of DLS (livestock assistants) which hitherto basically dealt only with
animal health care, will be providing farmers also with professional advice on animal husbandry practices.
Instead of remaining in their health posts and treating animals when the need arises, they will
systematically visit farmers and advise them on all aspects of animal production. DLS will organize itself
to assume these new functions and will introduce, inter alia, extension supervisory staff and designate
Subject Matter Specialists.
3.09          No new extension staff will be hired by DAS and DLS other than to replace people
leaving the service. Once DAS and DLS field staff coordinate their extension activities, coverage should
be adequate, with one field extension agent per 360 dabadas. These ratios would be applied flexibly to
take into account regional characteristics. Staffing levels and staffing ratios as well as the posting of field
staff would be reviewed annually in order to achieve the highest possible cost effectiveness.
3.10         The extension system which will be applied will include (i) establishing and adopting a
time bound and supervised work program; (ii) providing regular and continuous training to staff at all
levels; and (iii) strengthening the links between extension and research. A special effort will be made
to develop and disseminate extension recommendations that address the particular concerns of resource
poor farmers (less than 2 ha and no animal drawn agricultural equipment) and of women farmers.
Extension agents will work with existing farmer groups and, where necessary, induce the creation of
farmer contact groups and foster their evolution towards groups that can assume other development
related activities. To support face-to-face extension advice by DAS and DLS front line staff, a media
based communications strategy will be developed by the Agricultural Communications Unit (ACU) of
DAS. To do this, ACU will liaise with radio stations, NGOs and the Non-Formal Education Unit of the
Ministry of Education.
3.11          Concerning technical recommendations for crop and livestock production and natural
resources management, proven technologies ready for transfer to farmers and livestock owners exist.
They were developed by researchers in collaboration with extension agents and farmers and have already
been adopted by many farmers. Other technical innovations will be coming on stream as a consequence
of ongoing research (for areas for which technical recommendations exist, see Annex 2).
3.12          Given the particularly intricate farming systems existing in the MacCarthy Island Division
(MID), where upland cultivation of cereals, and production of rice in swamp areas and small-scale
irrigation perimeters and livestock raising compete for scarce labor, extension agents would receive



- 15 -
special training to deal with this situation. Their skills in farming systems analysis and in the
identification of particular target groups and sociological constraints would be enhanced through specially
selected and trained Subject Matter Specialists. Field staff of DAS and DLS would work especially close
together in this Division to harmonize operations at the grassroots. In fact, MID would be the "test case"
for forming truly polyvalent field extension agents. The experience gained here would provide a solid
basis for extending a polyvalent approach to extension services countrywide and to move beyond a close
coordination of activities of DAS and DLS field extension staff. At negotiations, assurances were
obtained that the measures and procedures concerning extension activities described in paras. 3.05, 3.06
and 3.08 - 3.12 would be followed. They have since been sunmmarized in a Government policy statement
on extension which was submitted to IDA.
3.13          To implement the above DAS/DLS extension activities, the project would finance the
following:
(i)    renovation and repair of selected DAC and DEC facilities and veterinary posts including
provision of fences and the rehabilitation of wells;
(ii)   communication and office equipment and supply of farm implements to each DEC;
(iii)   pick-ups, motorcycles, mopeds, and bicycles;
(iv)   operating expenditures for vehicles;
(v)   travel allowances for extension staff; and
(vi)   overseas degree-level training (6 BSc.and 6 MSc.), in-service and specialized training and
technical assistance (Annex 3).
3.14          To allow SWMU to increase its soil conservation activities and to move from a focus on
damage treatment to prevention, the project would fund incremental operating expenditures of SWMU.
The Agricultural Communications Unit (ACU) with its radio, video, print shop and graphic art sections
would also be strengthened through financing of office equipment, video, audio and printing equipment,
incremental recurrent costs, and technical assistance.
3.15          Functional Literacy. The Non-Formal Education Department (NFED) will play a vital
role in helping to disseminate extension messages to the rural population through their literacy programs
in the countryside. The NFED together with ACU will develop and produce functional literacy materials
to this effect. In addition, an ongoing program of functional literacy training would be expanded in one
of the Divisions (MacCarthy Island Division), where increased farmers' participation is crucial to the
sustainability of past and ongoing irrigation investments. The functional literacy program would
concentrate on a population of some 22,000 people (para. 4.21).
3.16          The sub-component would support the DNFE through provision of: (i) intensive training
of 10 program assistants to train village facilitators; (ii) vehicles and equipment to the Divisional Program
Officer to make the assistants mobile; (iii) teaching allowances for village facilitators; and
(iv) consultants' services (3 man/months) to assist in preparing training materials.

Improving and Strengthening the Agricultural Research and Education System
3.17         Strengthening the Gambia Agricultural Research System (GARS). NARB would become
an independent body cororate under Gambian law, that would have ultimate responsibility for
agricultural research policy and public funding for research, including the guiding of official development
aid for agricultural research (donor coordination and consolidation of funding). DAR and DLS research
staff would be regrouped in one independent National Agricultural Research Institute (NARI) under
NARB auspices. NARB would create and manage the Gambia Agricultural Research Fund (GARF),
which would allow it to let research contracts with MNRE, ITC, NGOs, the private sector and other
national, regional and international research institutions. NARI would in the first instance be directly
funded through NARB, but, by January 1996, three years after project start-up, it should also be funded
through GARF on the basis of research contracts for which it would have to compete. For NARB to play
its role in overseeing NARI and to administer GARF, it would constitute a small Technical Secretariat
(TS), consisting of a highly qualified research manager and a finance expert, supported by a few
secretarial and administrative staff. The appointment of the Research Manager and Finance expert, with
terms of reference, qualifications and experience acceptable to IDA, would be a condition of effectiveness
(para. 6.02 (i)).
3.18         Under the research component, the project would finance the following:
(i)    establishment and operation of a Technical Secretariat (TS) to the National Agricultural
Research Board (NARB), and the preparation of a long term strategy (master plan) for
agricultural research;
(ii)   operating costs, except salaries, of National Agricultural Research Institute (NARI);
(iii)  initial contribution to Gambia Agricultural Research Fund (GARF) to fund selective
priority research programs on a contractual basis;
(vi)   strengthening of internal (with farmers, NGOs and extension services) and external
linkages (with national, regional and international research institutions);
(v)    establishment of an independent internal and external research program review system;
and
(vi)   provision of overseas scholarships for degree-level training (4 MSc and 3 BSc),
experiment station and scientific management training, participation in short overseas
courses to upgrade specific skills, and, where necessary, on-the-job training (Annex 3).
3.19         Strengthening the Agricultural School of the Gambia College. The school would be
supported to improve the quality and relevance of its two-year certificate and three-year diploma courses
(para. 2.09). In view of GOTG's policy to develop a unified and polyvalent extension service and to
meet the demand for general agriculturalists, the curriculum of both courses would be adjusted so as to
provide more courses on animal husbandry to the agriculturalists and more courses on crop production
to those following the livestock orientation. In addition, the School of Agriculture would make special
efforts to attract female students. Minimum requirement for new recruits into the extension service would
be certificate level training. Diploma level training would be the minimum recruitment requirement for
DESs. Diploma courses would also be made available for selected VEWs as part of their career



- 17 -
development. In collaboration with DAS, DOL and the NGOs, the School would provide in-service
training courses for extension staff and upgrade its facilities, in particular the class room and laboratory
facilities and the teaching farm. At negotiations, assurances were obtained that by December 31, 1993,
Gambia College School of Agriculture would alter the curricula of its courses, and prepare a plan to
attract female students (para. 6.01 (ii)).
3.20          The project would finance in-service training courses for field staff of DAS and DLS
provided by the Gambia College, a teaching laboratory and investments in a demonstration/teaching farm,
instruction materials, and publications and documentation. Closer links would be established with NARI
which would establish its experimental farm and headquarters on a piece of land adjacent to the School.
These linkages would be manifested through the exchange of staff and a greater participation of teaching
staff in research.
Promotion of Self-Reliance and Farmer Empowerment
3.21         To enhance the impact of investments in extension and research a number of
complementary activities will be carried out on a pilot basis in a selected area. These activities are
designed to foster farmer empowerment, promote self-reliance and sustainability of externally financed
interventions, and tap the indigenous development potential of rural people. The area selected is the
MacCarthy Island Division. This Division has had a long history of externally funded projects, especially
in irrigation development, and the beneficiaries are ready to organize themselves and to participate more
actively in their own economic development. These pilot activities will be carefully monitored and should
provide valuable lessons for the rest of the country. A participatory approach to monitoring and
evaluation of extension results will be used. For example, as part of their functional literacy training,
farmers would be trained to keep track of their agricultural tasks and production. Group discussions
would be held concerning adoption results and the causes of non-adoption.
3.22          These pilot activities are:
(i)    support for non-formal education, in particular the functional literacy and numeracy
program, to reach some 5 000 people in about 65 villages. This sub-component is
specifically designed to underpin the other pilot activities by preparing the local
population to assume these activities.
(ii)   formation of water users associations and associated farmer training for irrigated rice
production so that in due course they can take over the management of existing irrigation
perimeters;
(iii)  introduction of intermediate labor saving technologies (especially animal traction in
irrigated rice production) so as to be able to move away from heavy machinery which has
proven to be uneconomical and unsustainable;
(iv)   training of village entrepreneurs to encourage the establishment of small businesses for
farm inputs and implements thereby improving the availability of these inputs,
(v)    support to the development of rural financial services through the strengthening of six
existing and promotion of 15 new Village Savings and Credit Associations (VISACAS);
and



- is -
(vi)  support for community-initiated self-help activities and social infrastructure, including
village water supply, day-care centers, and village wood lots, through provision of a
Village Development Fund.
3.23         For these sub-components, the project would finance respectively: (i) training, vehicles
and equipment, teaching allowances for village facilitators, and short-term technical assistance;
(ii) training and visits abroad, soil and water testing equipment, engineering equipment and vehicles, and
short-term technical assistance; (iii) farmer training, adaptive research and consultancy services; (iv) a
sub-contract with Action Aid The Gambia; (v) a sub-contract with CIDR; and (vi) a contribution to the
UNDP financed Village Development Trust Fund.
D. Project Cost and Financing
Project Cost
3.24         The total base cost of the proposed project, net of taxes, is estimated at DL 156.7 million
(US$17.2 million equivalent). Base cost estimates reflect June 1992 prices. Physical contingencies
amounting to US$1.1 million are estimated to be 15% of civil works and 10% of other investment costs;
their total amounts to about 7% of base cost. Price contingencies amounting to US$1.3 million,
representing about 9% of base cost and 8% of total cost are based on average annual forecasts of
international inflation for foreign supplied goods (3.7% per annum), on estimated annual inflation in The
Gambia for local costs (5% per annum), and on an implementation period of five years (see para. 3.35).
The foreign exchange portion of the total project cost is 67%. The breakdown of total project cost of
US$17.2 million equivalent is as follows:

Project Financing
3.25                Project costs would be financed by an IDA credit of US$12.3 million equivalent and an
IFAD loan of US$3.6 million equivalent. The Gambian contribution would be US$1.3 million
equivalent, or about 10% of project costs net of the IFAD contribution. In addition to its monetary
contribution, Government would provide the agricultural extension and research staff. The tentative
financing plan is detailed below:

part. Of this, US$0.2 million (spare parts) would be procured by ICB, US$1.4 million would be procured by LCB
and US$0.2 million would be procured by prudent shopping. The remaining US$1.7 million is for salaries and travel allowances.



- 21 -
3.27         Civil work financed by IDA are:
(a)   construction of an office complex for the Environment Unit of MNRE, estimated at
US$322,400;
(b)   construction of laboratory and classrooms at the Gambia College (US$334,000);
(c)   construction of houses for extension staff in two divisions and greenhouses and
shadehouses at agricultural research stations (US$42,900); and
(d)   infrastructure, including fencing, road rehabilitation, and rehabilitation of irrigation
networks at research stations and divisional headquarters (US$660,000).
With the exception of items (a) and (b) which are located in or near Banjul, and would be procured by
international competitive bidding, the remainder of the works involve small contracts, are geographically
scattered over 25 administrative districts, and are unlikely to be of interest to foreign firms.
Consequently, items (c) and (d) would be procured under local competitive bidding procedures,
satisfactory to IDA, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$0.7 million.
3.28         Goo. Goods financed by IDA would include vehicles, furniture, office equipment,
laboratory equipment, audio-visual equipment, agricultural equipment, demonstration equipment for the
VEWs, materials, spare parts and training materials. Most of these goods would be procured in the first
two years of the project, and could be grouped into packages of at least US$100,000 each and procured
by international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA's Guidelines for Procurement under
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (May 1992). Contracts for goods procured under ICB would total
US$2.1 million. Where ICB procedures are used, a preferential margin of 15%, or the applicable
customs duty, whichever is less, over the c.i.f. prices of competing goods would be given to domestic
manufacturers in accordance with IDA Guidelines. Goods procured under contracts estimated to cost less
than US$100,000 equivalent each, which in the aggregate would not exceed US$1.6 million, would be
suitable for procurement through LCB under procedures acceptable to IDA. The remaining goods, which
cannot be grouped into bid packages of at least US$30,000 equivalent, would be procured on the basis
of price quotations from at least three suppliers, provided that the aggregate amount of such procurement
does not exceed US$0.4 million equivalent.
3.29         Services. Consultants financed by IDA, totalling US$1.2 million, would be contracted
in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and
by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981), and all such contracts would be subject to
prior review. Consulting services financed by the IDA credit would be short-term consultancies for
studies, policy analysis, sociological/gender issues, accounting, mid-term review, and research
programming and evaluation.
r
3.30         The project will finance a significant overseas degree training program in addition to the
periodic training of research and extension staff. An estimate of the formal training is in Annex 3.
3.31         The principal Government agency responsible for implementing the project is the
Coordination Unit located in the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). This Coordination Unit, which was
created under ADP-II, would continue to be responsible for project coordination, administration,
procurement, and monitoring of project extension and research activities. The submission of a detailed



- 22 -
procurement plan, including timetables, satisfactory to IDA, would be a condition of credit effectiveness
(para. 6.02 (ii)).
3.32         A Country Procurement Assessment Report was completed in June 1985.  In general,
The Gambia's current procurement laws and regulations do not conflict with IDA's Guidelines, with a
few exceptions. In order for LCB procedures to be acceptable to IDA, the credit documents should
include a side letter concerning advertising, public bid opening, clarity of evaluation criteria, award to
the lowest evaluated bidder, and non-exclusion of foreign bidders.
3.33         IDA-financed contracts for works and goods above a threshold of US$100,000 equivalent
each, and all consultant services, would be subject to IDA's prior review procedures. An assurance was
obtained at negotiations that Bank sample documents for the procurement of goods, works and consultants
would be used (para. 6.01 (iii)). The review process would cover about 68% of the works, goods and
services financed by IDA. Selective post review of awarded contracts below the threshold levels would
be carried out on about one in 10 works contracts and one in 5 goods contracts.
3.34         Procurement information will be collected and recorded as follows:
(a)    proni1pt reporting of contract award information by the Borrower;
(b)    comprehensive semi-annual reports to the Bank by the Borrower, indicating: (i) revised
cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project, including best estimates of
allowances for physical and price contingencies; (ii) revised timing of procurement
actions, including advertising, bidding, contract award, and completion time for
individual contracts; and (iii) compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of
procurement; and
(c)    a completion report prepared within six months of the credit's closing date.
F. Disbursement&
3.35         The project corresponds to a five-year program and the IDA credit would be disbursed
over a period of five years instead of over the standard seven and a half year disbursement profile for
all projects in The Gambia. Faster disbursements are anticipated because: (i) about 65% of the
investments will take place during the first two years of the project; and (ii) about 20% of the Credit
would be disbursed against selected items of the concerned institutions' annual operating budgets, and
therefore, would not be subject to implementation delays. The expected closing date is June 30, 1999.
The estimated semi-annual disbursement schedule is at Annex 6.

the Ministry of Agrieulture.
3.37            To expedite disbursements and ensure that funds for the project are available when
needed, Government would open two Special Accounts: Special Account A, operated by the National
Agricultural Research Board (NARB/NARI), and Special Account B, operated by the Ministry of
Agriculture, in a commercial bank, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association.
Immediately after Credit effectiveness, IDA would make an initial deposit of US$250,000 into Special
Account A, and a deposit of US$500,000 into Special Account B, representing about four months'
expenditures. IDA would replenish the Special Accounts upon receipt of satisfactory proof of incurred
expenditures and evidence that such expenditures were eligible for financing. Monthly bank statements



- 24 -
and reconciliation of the Special Account statements would accompany replenishment requests. To ensure
timely availability of counterpart funds, during negotiations assurances were obtained that the Borrower
will make provisions in its annual budget for such funds, provide such counterpart funding quarterly in
advance and pay it into a Project Account to be used exclusively for project purposes (para. 6.01 (iv)).
Establishment of this Project Account with an initial deposit of US$50,000 would be a condition
effectiveness (para. 6.02 (iii)).
3.38         Disbursements of the IDA credit would be fully documented except for incremental
operating costs and contracts valued at less than US$20,000 equivalent, which would be against
Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). Documentation for withdrawals under SOEs would be retained at the
Ministry of Agriculture and at the National Agricultural Research Board (NARB/NARI) for review by
IDA staff during supervision missions and for regular annual audits.
IV. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND IMPLEMENTATIO
A. Project Organization. Manarement and Financial Monitoring
4.01         The project would be implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture through the DAS, DLS,
and DOP and the National Agricultural Research Board (NARB). For minor activities to be implemented
for MOA by the Ministry of Education (ME), i.e., functional literacy training, the Gambia College, and
the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE), MOA would enter into formal
arrangements acceptable to IDA, that would stipulate that the Permanent Secretary (PS) of MOA, would
be responsible for the management of project expenditures for these components. Conclusion of these
arrangements, satisfactory to IDA, would be conditions of credit effectiveness (para. 6.02 (iv)). The
Village Development Fund would be administered under a separate tripartite agreement between GOTG,
IFAD, and UNDP.
4.02         Overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of all components, except for
agricultural research which would be the responsibility of NARB, would be with the Permanent Secretary
of the Ministry of Agriculture and the day-to-day coordination would be assured by his Deputy Permanent
Secretary, Programs and Projects who would be - ex officio - Project Coordinator (DPS/PC). The
DPS/PC would be assisted in his task by a small Project Support Unit (PSU), which was already
established under ADP-II as an integral part of the MOA. The PSU consists of a financial controller, an
administrative officer, an accountant and support staff. It would as in the past handle procurement,
administration, and monitoring of project implementation. The PSU would also maintain separate project
accounts using the recently introduced program budgeting system (PBS). During negotiations, assurances
were obtained that the Borrower would (i) maintain the PSU in a form and with functions satisfactory to
IDA, and (ii) cause MOA to maintain and strengthen its three-year rolling public expenditure
programming system linked to the public budgeting system (para. 6.01 (v)). The DPS/PC would also
be responsible for consolidating a human resources/training plan of the participating agencies in
consultation with the Personnel Management Office of the Presidency. Receipt of such a plan,
satisfactory to IDA, would be a condition of effectiveness (para. 6.02 (v)). During negotiations,
assurances were also obtained that this training plan would be reviewed annually between MOA and IDA,
and that a detailed plan for each subsequent year would be agreed upon (para. 6.01 (vi)). NARB would
be responsible for the implementation of the agricultural research component and would handle
procurement, administration, accounting, disbursements and monitoring related to the research
component.



- 25 -
B. Implementation of the Sector Analysis and Plannine Comoonent
4.03         This component would be under the responsibility of the Director of DOP who would
establish the training plan and agree annually with IDA and IFAD on the policy studies to be carried out
and on the type of information to be collected regarding progress of the extension system as part of the
National Agricultural Sample Survey.
C. Implementation of the Extension Component
4.04         At the national level, responsibility for crop extension will be with the Director of DAS
and for livestock extension with the Director of DLS. The two Departments would closely collaborate
at all levels to provide complementary extension recommendations to farmers/herders all over the
country. To this effect, field staff of both Departmnents will receive additional training from the
Agricultural School of the Gambia College in either crop or livestock aspects depending on their previous
specialization, and will be supported by SMS of both Departments including the SWMU and FNU of
DAS and the Forestry Department. All field staff will be familiarized with the whole gamut of extension
recommendations of the two Departments and most training sessions will be held jointly. In this respect,
during negotiations MOA presented a program of crop, livestock and natural resources management
extension messages, and a plan for the training of all VEWs of DAS in animal husbandry practices and
of livestock assistants of DLS in crop production. Supervisory staff and SMSs will be deployed in such
a way as to provide the best possible support to field staff. Supervisory staff in charge of VEWs and
livestock assistants can be of either Department, the objective being to arrive at a closely coordinated
national extension system. Also, in the bi-monthly technology review meetings between research and
extension, SMSs of both Departnents would participate. To define the approach to extension and the
modalities of collaboration between DAS and DLS in extension matters, and with agricultural research,
the Ministry has elaborated a policy statement. This policy statement includes provisions concerning the
purchase, management, maintenance and repair of motorcycles that ensure continuous mobility of
extension staff. It is based on two key principles, namely: (i) the means of transport belong to the user,
and (ii) the allowance the user receives is adequate to cover the operating costs (fuel and repairs). During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Borrower would ensure continuous mobility of its field
extension staff through, inter alia, an appropriate level of allowances paid to such staff. The adequacy
of this level would be reviewed annually (para. 6.01 (vi)).
4.05         At the regional (Divisional) level, tasks and functions would be as at present but, in
addition, each DAC and Principal Livestock Officer would be responsible for (a) preparing extension
documents (leaflets, a monthly bulletin, booklets, etc.) relevant to its division; and (b) programming field
trials in conjunction with staff of NARI. Divisional staff would receive advice and support from the
ACU for publications and from DAR in undertaking research programs. NGOs would be invited to
contribute materials for a monthly extension bulletin. A Divisional Coordination Committee would be
established at each of the six divisions under the joint chairmanship of the Divisional Agricultural
Coordinator and the Principal Veterinary Officer, and include appointed representatives from GCU,
NGOs, NFE and other ministries, and would provide for coordination at divisional and field level.
4.06         At the local level, the project calls for four changes compared to the past: (a) a move
away from dependence on contact farmers towards contact groups; (b) greater emphasis on on-farm
testing programs; and (c) an increase in the number of women's VEWs and of VEWs specializing in
women agricultural activities (e.g., swamp rice, horticulture, and short-cycle livestock species). To



- 26 -
increase the number of women in the service, and especially to interact with sinkiros groups, the DAS
and DLS would endeavor to fill vacancies by female professionals whenever feasible. Cooperation with
NGOs would be continued and, where possible, expanded by encouraging their participation in monthly
training sessions, joint production of extension bulletins by DACs and testing of technologies on-farm
in coordination with DAC/DECs. This would be done on the basis of contracts.
4.07         On-Farm Technology Demonstrations. As at present, extension supervisory staff would
be responsible for undertaking a series of on-farm demonstrations of proven technology which would
include as appropriate micro-plots on farmers fields, block demonstrations, Kafo farm demonstrations,
differential treatment of animals and herd management, and soil conservation measures at farm, village
and micro-catchment level. The demonstration program would be planned by each supervisor, in
conjunction with the divisional TOs and SMSs. Implementation would be by the VEWs and livestock
assistants, supported by the extension supervisory staff. In addition to these demonstrations, DAS and
DLS would step-up their participation in the national program of on-farm trials (OFT) designed to test
under actual farming conditions technologies developed by researchers. These trials would be designed
by researchers working in close cooperation with the divisional SMSs and after discussion with
farmer/herder groups.
4.08         Extension activities of DAS and DLS would be supported by the Agricultural
Communications Unit (ACU), the Soil and Water Management Unit (SWMU), and the Food and
Nutrition Unit (FNU). Although all three units are located within DAS, they would provide technical
backstopping to both Departments. The head of ACU would be responsible, inter alia, for: assisting
DACs and the Principal Livestock Officers in preparation of extension material; coordination with the
Non-Formal Education Department to ensure the incorporation of adult literacy programs into regular
extension programs; coordination with NGOs and activities of the Women in Development Project;
development of a regular program of work with Radio Gambia; and ensuring close linkage with research
program leaders. The head of SWMU would be responsible for developing extension recommendations
concerning: (a) on-farm soil conservation advice; and (b) advice at the village or community level on
the design and implementation of community land management plans (including watershed management
programs, range land management, and other agro-sylvo-pastoral aspects). For the first aspect, SWMU
staff would train all VEWs of DAS and staff of interested NGOs in soil conservation techniques and for
the second aspect, SWMU would constitute two interdisciplinary teams that would design community land
management plans using a participatory approach, and carry out the following tasks--primarily at the
request of villagers: resource inventory, formation of conservation committees, engineering/construction,
and agronomic follow-up by DAS extension staff.
D. Implementation of the Agricultural Research Component
4.09         National Agricultural Research Board (NARB). The objective of the institutional reform
of the Gambia Agricultural Research System (GARS) is to rationalize public and donor support by
unifying crops, livestock, forestry and natural resources management research under the umbrella of the
NARB (para. 3.17). To exercise its function as an independent research policy-maker and representative
of both the users of research results and GOTG/donor interests, NARB will become an autonomous body
corporate under Gambian law. NARB would be assisted by a Technical Secretariat (TS), and would have
a Finance Committee, and an independent Research Review Committee under its authority. To ensure
necessary management autonomy and decision-making transparency, NARB membership will consist of
five ex-officio members (including the Permanent Secretaries of MOA, MNRE and Finance, the Director



- 27 -
General of NARI and the President of NARB) and six non-officio members. The latter will be selected
on the basis of qualifications, technical competence and experience upon the recommendation of an
independent Search and Appointment Committee. The mandates, composition and terms of reference of
NARB's Technical Secretariat, Finance Committee and Research Committee will be included in NARB's
Order of Procedures. Draft Order of Procedures will be submitted to IDA and the other major donors
for comments prior to their adoption. The critical elements to be contained in the statutes of NARB and
the tasks to be performed by the Technical Secretariat (TS) are contained in Annex la.
4.10         National Agricultural Research Institute (NARD. NARB will be the governing board
of NARI, which will be created by combining research staff and installations presently managed by DAR
and DLS in the Ministry of Agriculture with those managed by MNRE. The Director General of NARI
will be selected on the basis of a short list of three candidates prepared by such a committee. Candidate
profiles and the composition and terms of reference of these search committees will have to be acceptable
to IDA and the other major donors represented in the Finance Committee. As an independent body
corporate NARI could seek collaborative arrangements for the implementation of individual research
programs with NGOs or other research institutions within The Gambia or outside its borders, rather than
undertaking 'in-house' all research within its mandate. NARI would initially be directly funded through
NARB, which would act as its board of governors. During the mid-term review of the project (para.
4.26), GOTG and IDA will analyze whether it is feasible that NARI be entirely funded through research
contracts. The future research system should allow for maximum flexibility (i.e. no monopolies) and
introduce an element of competition for research contracts. The due establishment of NARB and NARI
by law, satisfactory to IDA, would be a condition of Credit Effectiveness (para. 6.02 (v).
4.11         Research Manaeement and Resource Allocation within NARI. Improvements in the
agricultural research management system of DAR, tested and implemented from 1986 to 1992 under the
GARD project, would basically remain the same for NARI. The essential elements of this management
system would be institutionalized under the proposed project, i.e. be included in NARB/NARI's statutes.
This should provide the necessary guarantees for the participation of the users of research results
(farmers, NGOs, extension services and the private sector) in the setting of the research agenda. Also,
the system should provide for timely interaction with NARB and its statutory committees. The three
principal management elements of this system, i.e. research program task forces (RPTFs), Annual
Research Reviews (ARREV) and Program Advisory Committees (PAC) are described in Annex I a.
4.12         Many agricultural research activities are seasonal. Most field trials have to start in June.
This means that preparation (preparing research protocols and field books, ordering materials, etc...) has
to start at least six months earlier and that decisions on available resources have to be made before
December 31 of each year. Therefore, the statutes of NARB/NARI would provide for an annual
programming, budgeting and review cycle with specific dates. For details see Annex 1 a.
4.13         Research Programming. Monitoring. Evaluation and Review (PMER). The Gambia
agricultural research system recognizes three levels of PMER:
(a)    strategic planning under the responsibility of NARB through the preparation, regular
review and updating of national agricultural research Master Plans;
(b)   regular and independent technical reviews of individual research programs and research
contracts; and



- 28 -
(c)   the annual programming, progress reporting, review and budgeting cycle described in
Annex la.
4.14         NARI will have its own research programming and program (or contract) implementation
monitoring system. TS will be responsible for setting up this system for the entire Gambia agricultural
research system, based on information to be furnished by NARI and reporting and review requirements
to be included in individual research contracts funded under GARF. TS will commission the design of
the system and subsequently present detailed proposals to the Research Review and Finance Committees
prior to its adoption by NARB and introduction by January 1, 1994. The terms of reference for the
design of the system should be acceptable to IDA and will include the establishment of research databases
and linkages with outside sources of scientific information. Agreements to this effect were obtained
during negotiations (para. 6.01 (vii)).
4.15         NARS Internal (users of technology) and External (sources of technology) Linkages. The
most direct linkages between research and farmers are through DAR's on-farm research and testing
programs, conceived together with the extension services and NGOs. The most recent activity conceived
by DAS is the FITT program described in paragraph 2.18, which tries to give the farmer a more direct
voice in setting the research agenda and immediate program goals. The more formal links between
research and its clientele through annual research reviews carried out by research program task forces
would be institutionalized and become mandatory steps in the decision making process. The decision-
making that will be followed by NARI are described in Annex Ia.
4.16   GARS quasi-total dependence on technology generated elsewhere, as a reality and as an explicit
policy, makes it vulnerable to weaknesses in its links with outside sources of technology and information.
At present, GARS maintains an impressive range of linkages with external sources of innovation. These
include all the IARCs operating in The Gambia's agro-ecological environment, namely IITA (cowpeas,
cassava, maize, cropping systems/socio-economics; ICRISAT (sorghum, millet, groundnuts);
ILCAIILRAD (animal production and health); IFPRI (food policy); and ISNAR (research management).
Contacts with regional programs and NARSs include INSAH, AGRHYMET, SAFGRAD and Senegal
(ISRA). Finally, connections with institutions through donor-supported projects, notably the Universities
of Wisconsin, Michigan and Virginia. However, the latter tend to be the weakest upon "project
completion". On this point, the Bank-supported Special Program for African Agricultural Research
(SPAAR) intends to support reinforcing and stabilizing the linkages between countries in similar agro-
ecological conditions. GARS is expected to benefit from this initiative through its participation in
regional collaborative programs, in particular through the exchange of information and staff and through
its on-farm testing programs. Improved linkages with research databases and other outside sources of
outside information (documentation, publications, etc...) supported under the project should complement
such collaborative efforts.
4.17         NARI Human Resources Development and Management. As long as scientists remain
civil servants, it will be impossible in the short run to offer them a salary structure that would reverse
the present excessively high staff turnover rates. Moreover, regular GOTG funding of research operating
expenditures, which could also be an important motivating factor for scientists to stay with the system,
will remain uncertain under the prevailing economic conditions. Therefore, GOTG has decided, in line
with the SPAAR initiative, to grant NARI financial and personnel management autonomy by transforming
NARB and DAR each into a body corporate. This would allow NARI to develop its own scheme of
service under NARB oversight. NARB would also indirectly influence salary structures in other research
organizations competing for research contracts funded under NARF. By July 31, 1994, NARI would



- 29 -
prepare for approval by the Finance Committee and NARB: (i) an update of the February 1990 report
on human resource management and staff development (GARD Report N 58); (ii) proposals for criteria
for the recruitment, evaluation/promotion, tenuring and termination of staff; and (iii) draft employment
conditions including salary scales and employment under fixed term contract. Assurances were obtained
at negotiations that NARB would seek IDA approval for the proposed scheme of service prior to its
implementation (para. 6.01 (viii)).
4.18         NARB/NARI Financial Management. The on-going GARD project has successfully
designed and introduced a program/budgeting system for DAR. The system is in the process of being
introduced by other MOA Departments. The future accounting and financial management system of
NARB and NARI would be based on this system. The establishment of NARI as an independent and
autonomous body corporate implies the transfer of research assets Oand, buildings and equipment) that
presently are owned by GOTG. These assets will need to be inventoried, their value estimated and
presented in an opening balance sheet, certified by an independent auditor. Fulfillment of these
requirements would be an integral part of the establishment of NARI, i.e. enactment of its statutes.
4.19         Research Station Operation and Maintenance.  Costs of operating and maintaining
research facilities have in the past been under-budgeted. Therefore, the program/budgeting system will
need to be further developed into a management tool for the efficient operation of research stations and
laboratories. This is of particular importance when a few years hence the system is going to be managed
to a large extent through contractual arrangements. During the first year of the project, NARI would
employ consultants to assist in strengthening and improving its research station management through on-
the-job training. Assurances were obtained during negotiations to this effect (para. 6.01 (ix)).
4.20         Gambia Agricultural Research Fund (GARFl. All official development aid and GOTG
funds for agricultural research would be administered by NARB, including the Gambia Agricultural
Research Fund (GARF). Research funding would either be in direct support for NARI, or for research
contracts to be paid through GARF. In the short term, funds entrusted to GARF would be used to pay
for specific research contracts managed by NARB/PTS according to commonly agreed procedures, rather
than to cover part of the overall costs of GARS. This may change in the future as donors (including
GOTG) gain confidence in the system, i.e. would be willing to put their funds into GARF without
earmarking and trust the accounting system to be able to trace the usage of funds by source of finance.
GOTG, IDA and IFAD disbursements for NARI would be by category of expenditure, whereas
disbursements for research contracts would be according to contract specifications, independent of the
type of expenditure. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that NARB would submit for IDA's
approval draft standard contract specifications for research proposals to be financed through GARF prior
to concluding the first such research contract (para. 6.01 (x)).
E. Implementation of the Component to Promote Self-Reliance
and Farmer Empowerment
4.21         Execution on a pilot basis of these sub-components in the MacCarthy Island Division
(MID) would be as follows:
(a)   the functional literacy and numeracy program to reach some 5,000 people in about 65
villages would be the responsibility of DNFE of the Ministry of Education. DNFE
would select 10 educators from existing staff who in turn would train village facilitators



- 30 -
according to well established procedures.  Vocational training material would be
developed in close collaboration between DNFE and DAS/DLS and the 10 educators
would work closely with extension personnel in the area.
(b)    formation of water users' associations would be the responsibility of head of the SWMU
who would designate two of his staff for this task. These two professionals selected
would visit the Philippines to study the participatory approach as practiced in the Visayas
Communal Irrigation Project. Appropriate forms (water permits) and other relevant
documents obtained in the Philippines would then be adapted to Gambian circumstances.
Simultaneously to the training abroad of SWMU staff and to the preparation of
documentation, MOA/DAS/SWMU would contract an NGO that would, with the help
of DAS/ACU staff, inform "Seyfos' (traditional chiefs of districts) and "Alkalos" about
the purpose of forming water users' associations and seek their collaboration. With the
help of these traditional authorities, SWMU/NGO staff would then proceed with the
identification of suitable groups and ask these groups to nominate an "irrigation helper".
These irrigation helpers would then receive on-the-job training.
(c)   testing of intermediate labor saving technology, in particular of animal traction in
irrigated rice production would be the responsibility of NARI. It is expected that this
specific research contract would be given to ITC that has considerable expertise in this
domain.  Subsequent promotion of this technology would be the responsibility of
DAS/DLS extension field staff and animal traction instructors.
(d)   training of village entrepreneurs would be subcontracted with Action-Aid The Gambia
(AATG), an NGO with considerable experience in village input supply, the preparation
of training materials and the conduct of training programs. The training programs would
be conducted by staff of AATG with resource persons drawn from GCU and the
Agricultural Input Office. The training would cover such aspects as procurement of
inputs and output, their handling, estimation of demand, financial management, and basic
accounting and record keeping. Decisions on launching a business would be the decision
of the entrepreneur himself/herself, although the training to be provided will include
advice on possible sources of financing and supplies.
(e)    support to the expansion of Village Savings and Loan Associations (VISACAS) in the
MacCarthy Island Division will be the responsibility of the 'Centre International de
Recherche et de De6veloppement - CIDR", an NGO which has successfully introduced this
concept in The Gamnbia. CIDR will provide technical assistance and recruit suitable local
counterpart staff, the objective being to assist VISACAS over time to link up with formal
financial institutions. This support to VISACAS, as well as the training of village
entrepreneurs, will serve to test new approaches to rural financial services.
(f)    support for community-initiated self-help activities would be channeled through the
UNDP financed Village Development Trust Fund (UNDP-GAM/90/008). This fund is
designed to promote participatory rural development through support to village groups.
It is already being used successfully under the WID project and its operating procedures
are satisfactory.



- 31 -
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the above sub-components would be executed as
described above and in accordance with an implementation plan agreed by the Borrower and IDA
(para. 6.01 (xi)).
F. Financial Management and Reporting
4.22         Financial management and project accounts will be the responsibility of PSU and of
NARB/NARI for the research component. Both PSU and NARB/NARI will be staffed by qualified
accountants acceptable to the Association. The project accounts shall be maintained in accordance with
sound and internationally recognized accounting principles and practices satisfactory to the Association.
The accounting units will provide interim and annual financial statements to reflect the financial
performance and position of the project. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the project
accounts including the special accounts will be audited by international independent auditors acceptable
to IDA and reports satisfactory to IDA on such statements will be provided within six months of the close
of the fiscal year (para 6.01 (xii)). The auditor(s)'s reports will include a statement on the adequacy or
otherwise of the accounting systems and internal controls, the reliability of statements of expenditures as
a basis for loan disbursements, the operation and use of the Special Accounts, and compliance with
financial covenants. At negotiations, the Gambian delegation submitted to the Association for approval
a short list of auditing firms and TOR for audit of project accounts, and the appointment of an
independent auditing firm, acceptable to the Association, to audit project accounts during a period of three
years will be a condition of effectiveness (para. 6.02 (vi)).
4.23         The DPS/PC and the TS of NARB would prepare and submit to IDA six-monthly reports
highlighting progress achieved in project implementation, issues encountered and solutions proposed. The
content of the reports will evolve during project implementation with the objective of keeping the Bank
informed of the most important project parameters, without constituting an undue burden for the project
staff and without overlapping with other documents supplied to IDA (monitoring report, budget, work
program). Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations (para. 6.01 (xiii)).
G. Training and Technical Assistance
4.24         All degree level training will be coordinated by the DPS/PC and will be approved by the
Personnel Management Office (PMO), except for researchers where the Director of NARI would be
responsible. The PMO assesses training needs in the civil service and establishes training priorities in
accordance with Government's development and manpower priorities. Training abroad will only be
supported if there is no possibility of an appropriate program in The Gambia. For more details see
Annex 3. Short-term technical assistance will also be coordinated by DPS/PC.
H. Implementation and Effectiveness Monitoring
4.25         Given the difficult nature of institutional improvements in extension and research services,
the project will be closely monitored. The supervision plan (Annex 7), the project implementation
schedule (Annex 9), and selected key indicators (Annex 4) will serve as the basis for this monitoring.
Particular emphasis will be placed on obtaining feedback on client satisfaction, i.e., farmers' reactions.
The M&E Unit of the DOP will have overall responsibility for coordinating the monitoring and evaluation



- 32 -
efforts, with substantial inputs from the DAS, DLS and NARB. The main indicators that would be used
to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the extension and research effort would be:
(a)   extension activities: the percentage of farmers (male and female) reached by
extension, average attendance at meetings with extension agent, number of test
plots, number of on-farm trials, farmers' satisfaction with advice received and
work attitudes of extension and research staff;
(b)   training: type of training, periodicity and institution involved by category of
extension personnel;
(c)   research and links with research: new research findings, off-the-shelf results
from research translated into technical recommendations, problems included in
adaptive research program of trials, and main topics of trials; and
(d)   results: for major technical messages, evidence of adoption, repeat adoption,
rejection and reason; and evidence of impact on yield, production or productivity
and factors that explain results.
4.26         Mid-term Implementation Review. Because of the institution-building nature of the
project, the implementing agencies, and the Bank would carry out a joint mid-term review of the project
no later than end of project Year 3. The review would cover physical implementation, the extent to
which project and institutional objectives have been achieved, as reflected in key monitoring indicators
discussed and agreed at negotiations, and the results of an adoption and diffusion study. The findings
and recommendations of this mid-term review would be implemented promptly thereafter. The Project
Coordinator, together with the Directors of DAS, DAR, and DOP would be responsible for organizing
this review, and would prepare and submit to IDA, three months prior to the date of the mid-term review,
the reports, data and other information required for a sucessful mid-term review. Review of the research
component would be organized by the Chairman of NARB and the Director of NARI. Within six months
of the credit closing date, the Project Coordinator would be responsible for preparing a project
completion report that would summarize the project's performance and evaluate lessons learned based on
reports prepared by each of the implementing agencies. Assurances on the above were obtained during
negotiations (para. 6.01 (xiv)).
V. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Environmental Impact
5.01         The agro-ecological environment of The Gambia is difficult and in most regions crops,
livestock and trees are subject to stress. Unreliable rainfall distribution and the increasing frequency of
droughts is adding to the difficulties in the agricultural sector. In addition, expanding human and animal
populations are steadily increasing the pressures on the fragile natural resource base.
5.02         The main thrust of the work of the research and extension services to be supported under
the project will be increasing agricultural production in a sustainable manner. This will be realized



- 33 -
primarily by improved cultural practices and improved herd management, i.e., low-cost (often zero cash
cost) and low-risk measures such as soil conservation, water harvesting, contour planting, zero tilling,
composting, alley-cropping, agro-forestry and better integration of crops and livestock, as well as more
efficient application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Adoption of these measures will increase land
productivity and arrest soil degradation and will also complement activities financed by USAID under its
Natural Resources Support Project, currently under preparation. In addition, the project includes support
for the implementation of the National Environmental Action Plan. It is thus anticipated that the proposed
project would be environmentally positive.
B. Benefits
5.03         The project should greatly contribute to the well-being of the rural population. Most of
the 550,000 people in rural areas would benefit from a more dynamic agricultural education, research
and extension system that continuously generates and diffuses improved agricultural practices. However,
how many of these households would choose to adopt recommended practices cannot be estimated with
any precision. More specifically, project benefits should manifest themselves in four main areas:
(a)   increases in production and productivity of both the crop and livestock sectors
in a sustainable manner;
(b)    better coordination of delivery of agricultural services within the public sector
and with the private sector (NGOs, farmer organizations);
(c)    human resources:  the project strongly emphasizes training and continuing
education programs for farmers, herders and government staff. The project
would greatly enhance the capabilities of some 200 staff at all levels; and
(d)   institutional development: by further strengthening the capacity of DAS, DLS,
DOR, the agricultural research system and the Gambia College, MOA's ability
to plan, coordinate and deliver agricultural support services to the farming
community will be greatly enhanced. The project will allow for a more effective
system of technology generation and diffusion and will permit better leadership
of other agricultural services, thereby creating a good opportunity to streamline
donor financial assistance.
C. Sustalnability
5.04         The sustainability of the project is assured by the strong human resource development
component that would build up the capacity of DAS and DLS to provide effective extension services and
of NARB/NARI to provide the country with a steady flow of appropriate technologies. The organization
of farmers into groups and the strengthening of farmers' associations would increase their capacity to deal
with credit issues, input suppliers and buyers of farm produce, thus reducing in the long-run their
dependence on extension staff for dealing with these aspects. MOA's ability to plan and coordinate
agricultural extension at the national level would be greatly enhanced by the project. This would allow
for a more effective system of technology generation, diffusion and adoption and would permit improved
capacity and leadership of other agricultural services, thereby creating a better opportunity for obtaining



- 34 -
and streamlining both internal and external financing. The infrastructural requirements of the extension
system in terms of office and staff accommodations would be in place to continue the national program.
The recurrent costs can be expected to decrease with further improvements in extension and research
management and it may be opportune to begin attempting partial cost recovery from certain farmers'
associations and to privatize delivery of extension services for certain cash crops. There will nonetheless
be significant continuing costs to be met for public extension services, to be addressed under a follow-up
project that would be the third five-year time slice of the long-term national program to improve research
and extension related services and create strong farmer organizations.
D. Justification
5.05          It is not possible to isolate the effects of manpower training, extension and adaptive
research, and improvement in agricultural policy analysis on agricultural output and income.
Development and adoption of technical improvements in crop, animal and tree husbandry, water
harvesting and soil conservation, depends on many factors, of which field testing and effective
dissemination are just a part. Other factors include prices of outputs and inputs (including labor and
capital), accessibility of markets and credit, differentiation of farm enterprises by size, tenure and
capitalization, and different assessments of risk and opportunities for risk sharing. While the causality
underlying creation and adoption of innovations is difficult to determine, "good" research and extension
clearly have a catalytic role to play both by developing and by bringing farmers' and others'
preoccupations to the attention of those who can adapt in consequence, such as bankers, tradesmen,
merchants, commodity processors as well as national policy-makers. Despite the difficulties with
causality, a recent review of studies that have attempted to measure the impact of agricultural extension
programs on farmer adoption and productivity concluded that extension in a number of countries has been
a high pay-off investment.
5.06          A vibrant agricultural knowledge and information system is, therefore, a necessary but
not sufficient condition for agricultural growth, and its effects cannot be conclusively quantified. While
an economic rate of return could be attempted, the calculation would be fraught with theoretical and
empirical difficulties, and reduction of the outcome to a single rate of return would be spurious. A more
illuminating, although still imprecise, indicator is the increase in agricultural value added that would be
required to cover the costs of "good" extension and research. In The Gambia, the staff exists; the
incremental cost of the extension and research system is the mobility, equipment, and continuous in-
service training of such staff. This cost is US$1.2 million/ year, or about 1.85 % of agricultural value
added. Since the project covers all of the rural population, the project's incremental costs are about 2
% of the income of the target population and, to break even, would have to increase the target
population's income by a similar annual increment. This increase is attainable in view of the monitored
results on hundreds of micro-plots. On the basis of households, the project would reach some 69,000
8-person units, at a cost of about US$17/household/year. It would suffice for these households to plant
a new 0.25 ha test plot each year to cover the costs of extension and research (Annex 8). The salary and
benefit costs of the existing staff for whom equipment, mobility and training would be provided under
the project amount to US$300,000/year. If these costs are included with the above incremental costs,
the break-even rates would increase from 1.85 % to 2.4 % of the income of the target population. Thus,
even including the salary and benefit costs of existing staff, the break-even rates are obtainable.

E. Risi
5.07         The risks foreseen, which are common to similar projects supported by IDA, include:
(i) ineffective management of research and extension personnel; (ii) low adoption rates of technical
recommendations by farmers and/or slow build-up of applicable technology by research, especially given
its dependence on outside sources of technology and information; and (iii) the possible failure of
Government and/or donors to sustain the long-term commitment required to achieve durable
improvements in the effectiveness of agricultural support services. To minimize these risks, the lessons
learned under ADP-II, IFAD funded agricultural projects, and a USAID supported research project have
been built into the project design.
5.08         Concerning the management of research and extension services, improved management
is expected as a result of the improved organization, training, monitoring and evaluation, and technical
assistance to be provided under the project. Concerning technical advice to farmers, ADP-II has shown
that appropriate technologies are available. There is room for sizeable improvements in food crop and
livestock production and better natural resources management since many of the country's farmers and
herders, especially women, have not yet had access to extension advice at all. The project also focusses
on the pre-extension testing of a sizeable body of existing research results existing within the country and
abroad, and on strengthening research linkages with the outside world. Finally, the annual review of
work plans and budgets, as well as the mid-term implementation review, will provide good opportunities
for program review and long-term commitment building.
VI. ASSURANCES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01         Assurances obtained at negotiations are:

THE GAMBIA
AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT
Evaluation or Effectiveness of DAS Crop Extension
1.           An adoption/diffusion study was carried out from November 1991 through May 1992
under the leadership of Messrs. Omar Sonko, Department of Planning, Ministry of Agriculture and
Sana Jabang, Department of Agricultural Services, Ministry of Agriculture. The results were
presented in June 1992 in a report entitled: "Adoption/Diffusion Evaluation Report of the
Department of Agricultural Services and the Department of Agricultural Research Crop Production
Recommendations to Farmers" available in the Project File.
2.           The TOR of the study were to assess the extent to which farmers were aware of
extension recommendations and to determine how many had actually adopted them over the period
1986-91. Some 333 dabadas (production units) were randomly selected from all over the country and
from within each dabada, one farmer was asked to answer a standardized questionnaire. In addition,
30 "contact farmers" were selected giving a total of 363 farmers being interviewed with the same
questionnaire. Percentage figures given below refer to this population.
3.           More specifically, the adoption/diffusion study aimed at meeting five major
objectives:
(i)    To determine the spread of extension messages within the farming community.
(ii)   To make comparative analysis of the different extension methodologies/strategies used
by DAS in getting the message across to farmers and determine the extent of their
effectiveness.
(iii)   To determine the adoption rate of the recommended agricultural practices under the
following headings:
(a)    Non-adoption.
(b)    Partial adoption.
(c)    Full adoption.
(iv)   To determine the factors affecting the adoption of the recommended practices.
(v)    To recommend ways by which Divisional Agricultural Coordinators can incorporate
adoption/diffusion studies in their work programs.
4.           Specifically, the evaluation study focussed on the diffusion and adoption of the
recommended agricultural practices being promoted by DAS. The following are examples of some of
the practices:
(i)    Optimal plant population.



- 38 -
ANNEX a
Page 2
(ii)   Thinning of millet.
(iii)   Timeliness of operations.
(iv)   Use of improved varieties.
(v)    Row seeding of rice.
(vi)   Striga control measures.
(vii)  Seed dressing.
(viii)  Fertilizer rate per crop.
(ix)   Use of herbicides.
Principal Findings of the Study
5.           The analysis of the data suggests that factors that influence the diffusion of
innovations among farmers in The Gambia fall within the following areas of extension activity:
(i)    Visits (micro-plots).
(ii)    Attendance at demonstrations (on larger tracts of land and mostly with purchased
inputs).
(iii)  Information sharing among farmers themselves (contact and non contact farmers).
(iv)   Training of farmers by extension agents (one week per year and primarily to show use
of animal drawn equipment).
6.           Regularity of extension visits is surfaced in the survey results although the majority of
farmers interviewed (94%) would prefer more visits than extension agents are doing currently. For
this year (1991), 58% of those interviewed say they have been visited three times or more during the
four-month agricultural season. On the other hand, contact and non contact farmer visits to research
stations and District extension centers is generally poor. Only in certain Divisions (NBD, LRD and
MID/S do contact farmers visit their DEC's fairly regularly.
7.           Poor attendance to demonstrations is indicated in all the Divisions even though
demonstrations are being conducted in all the Divisions this season. Comparing the Divisions,
frequently of attendance in Western Division and MacCarthy Island Division/South is greater than in
other Divisions. On the average (The Gambia), 13% of farmers interviewed attended demonstrations
at least twice this season. This low attendance in demonstrations is further confirmed by farmers
poor knowledge of demonstration sites. Fifty-nine percent of those interviewed say they do not know
the demonstrations sites. Use of this strategy (demonstration of purchased inputs on large tracts of
land owned by groups) should be given less emphasis in the future given the problems associated with
this strategy.
8.           On the side of extension training (one week meetings per year in selected villages to
demonstrate primarily the use of animal drawn equipment), the study shows that only 30% of non
contact farmers attended training sessions and of these, only 20% attended training sessions this
season. Division wise MacCarthy Island Division/South has the highest rate of attendance (38%) this
season. The continued usefulness of this activity which has been carried out for many years is
questionable and the whole concept needs to be rethought.
9.           The rate of information sharing among contact and non contact farmers is very high
according to contact farmers response (94%). However, only 46% of non contact farmers share this

view. The majority of the non contact farmers view is that information sharing is more common
among themselves (i.e., the non contact farmers).
10.          Apart from extension contact, 79% of the farmers say that their other source of
farming advice is though Radio Gambia. The apparent high level of information sharing among the
farmers and the common use of the National Radio as an added source to extension for farming
advice suggest effective diffusion of messages within the farming community.
Farmers Awareness of Extension Recommendations
11.          The level of success briefly discussed on each of the above extension activities has a
lot of bearing on the level of farmer awareness of the various extension recommendations on
production practices. Hence the findings of this study on awareness of recommended technologies
show a direct relationship with the rate of information dissemination described above.
12.          In general, the level of awareness on some extension recommendations is impressive.
These include thinning on coarse grains (cereals) with an average awareness rate of 90%; use of
improved groundnuts and maize varieties with 70% and 57% awareness rates respectively; and
timeliness on planting, weeding and harvesting of these crops (99%, 100% and 99% awareness rates
respectively). Also, there is a very high rate of awareness on cultural practices for striga control
(93%).
13.          Awareness level on fertilizer rates is fairly high for some crop (groundnuts 56%, late
millet 52%, maize 48% and sorghum 39%) and very low for others (sesame 14%, cowpea 16%,
vegetables 18% and swamp rice 25%).
14.          The level of awareness on other recommendations is very low. Most farmers are not
aware of the correct seed rates for maize, early millet, late millet, groundnut and upland rice. The
awareness rate in this area range from 12% to 27% (country average). Almost the same range is
reflected in all the Divisions except in MacCarthy Island Division North bank where there is 100%
awareness on seed rates for late millet. "Spacing" complements "seed rates" when talking about
optimum plant population. For this too, awareness on extension recommendation is low for all the
crops except swamp rice for which 62% of farmers interviewed are aware.
15.          It should be noted that exposure to information regarding new technology has great
bearing on the adoption of the technology.
Adoption of Recommended Farming Practices
16.          For fertilizer rates on various crops, adoption rates are generally low (10% - 28%).
Also, the findings indicate that of those adopting fertilizer rates, the majority are applying half the
rate which is also an extension recommendation. This is more so with sorghum and upland rice (68%
and 64%, respectively).
17.          Adoption of correct spacing for the various crops is impressive over the years (1986-
199 1). There has been a lot of improvement in 1990 and 1991 over the previous years. Adoption
rates for maize is 50% and 54%, and 55% and 58% for groundnuts in the last two years (1990 and



- 40 -
ANNEX la
Page 4
1991). Division wise too, adoption rates for spacing is good and there is little variation between
Division. The rate of adoption by those already aware of the technology is quite high up to 100% for
some crops in some Divisions.
18.          Adoption of recommended seed rates over the years (1986-1991) varies from crop to
crop. For groundnuts the adoption rate ranges from 31% in 1986 to 55% in 1991. For maize it was
18% in 1987, up to 43% in 1991. For millet, some 75% of farmers have adopted the recommended
seed rates.
19.          Adoption rates on thinning are also fairly impressive for the whole project period
(1986-1991), but for the other production practices (i.e. use of herbicides, use of improved varieties)
they are not as good as those cited above. On the average however, adoption of recommended
practices are within our expectations (50% average) before we embarked on the study.
20.          Our surprises include the low level of awareness in some cases but, among those
aware, the rate of adoption is very high for most of the recommended practices. The low level of
awareness could be attributed to the increase in number of villages covered by one VEW which is on
the average doubled at present.
Factors Contributing to non Adoption
21.          The following factors have some correlation with non-adoption of the recommended
farming practices in the Gambia:
(i)   Inadequate labor.
(ii)   Inadequate extension coverage.
(iii)   Farmer participation in extension strategies.
(iv)   Availability and affordability of inputs.
(v)    Access to credit.
22.          Inadequate labor is the main reason for not adopting thinning on Maize (36%) and
Early Millet (32%). Also, some (21%) farmers said they cannot cope with row seeding of rice
because of inadequate labor. Farmer participation in extension strategies is a major contributing
factor for adoption of recommended practices. According to the survey, 17% of the farmers have
participated in micro plots, 7% in block demonstrations, 67% in kafo farms and 20% in trial
demonstrations. This seem to be closely related to the rates of adoption for the various
recommendations.
23.          Availability and affordability of inputs are very well covered in our Survey. For
fertilizer recommendations, the main reasons given for non adoption are availability and cost. Cost is
the constraint for herbicide application as well.
24.          Only North Bank Division, Western Division and Upper River Division are using
most of their credit on farm inputs and machinery. The others may have very little credit which, are
used for other things not connected with farming such as food purchases.

25.          As implied in its concept/definition, the effectiveness of the T & V extension system
in The Gambia depends greatly on the extent to which the extension force succeeds in reaching out to
the farming population with relevant information, advice and ideas that can/will encourage these
farmers to practice/apply new technologies and practices in their farms.
26.          DAS extension systems can be said to be actively involved in this process and that it
is achieving some success. However, the T & V extension Systems efforts at achieving optimal
adoption of improved crop production practices by farmers still has some shortcomings. It is in the
light of these weaknesses that the following recommendations are put forward.
27.          More and regular training of farmers at village level is recommended. To
complement the promotional role of the contact farmer in the extension system as operated by the
Department of Agricultural Services (DAS), non-contact farmers should be encouraged more to attend
the training sessions. In fact, the emphasis should shift from working with contact farmers to
working with contact groups. This will result in a wider and faster dissemination of agricultural
recommendations within the farming community.
28.          It will be necessary to further complement these regular farmer training sessions with
demonstration sessions and/or field trips or field days which should be well published to encourage
high attendance.
29.          While adoption rates of some of the technologies may seem adequate it could be
argued that this may not be as a result of direct extension intervention only. In this regard therefore,
it is recommended that extension workers pursue a vigorous appraisal of crop production
shortcomings and try to focus on those which are seen as critical factors (i.e. from the farmers
perspective) and on which a significant visible impact (particularly yield) can be obtained.
30.          A mix of extension strategies in pursuing extension teaching efforts at increasing crop
production is a crucial element of the T & V extension system. However, a standardized approach to
the use of these strategies across the divisions is not compatible with the current staffmg of the DAS.
31.          Hence, we wish to recommend that extension workers only concentrate on those
strategies with which they can adequately address the farmers production constraints in their areas. It
will even be wiser to concentrate on one or two constraints (impact point) within a manageable
geographical area involving many farmer participants and using primarily micro-plots and the group
approach to encourage adoption of new technologies by farmers.
32.          An important source of farming advice for a majority of our farmers is Radio
Gambia. Since this service is provided by the Agricultural Communication Unit (ACU) through
Radio Gambia a more formal approach to this important farmer teaching method is essential. Better
organized contact and non-contact groups should be 'formed' and used as formal radio listening
groups. These should be routinely serviced by ACU through programming follow-up and
competitions. This approach could help in improving information sharing among and between the
groups.
33.          Adequate funding of Divisional evaluation studies should be provided so that results
can be properly documented, published and circulated to all those concerned.

2.           Technical Secretariat aM. The TS would have the following tasks:
(i)    organize the preparation, validation and regular updating of a national agricultural
research strategy (master plan), as a yardstick to direct decision making on priority
research objectives and research funding;
(ii)   implementation oversight and administration of research contracts funded through GARF,
including the organization of independent scientific reviews and financial audits as
provided for under the terms of individual contracts;
(iii)   organize independent scientific and financial audits of research institutions under NARB's
authority (including NARI), as provided for in the statutes of these institutions;
(iv)   prepare guidelines for research proposal presentation, progress reporting and financial
accountability;
(v)    based on information provided by research institutions under NARB's authority and on

elements to be presented annually to the Research Review and Finance Committees; and
(vi)   act as a secretariat to the meetings of the Research Review and Finance Committees and
disseminate their reports.
3.           The three principal elements of DAR's research management and resources allocation
system are:
(i)    Research Program Task Forces (RPTFs); for each of the 7 programs, participants include
DAS/DLS, NGO and farmer representatives; RPTFs act as advisory panels to the
program leaders for decisions on priorities and resource allocations at the program level;
on-farm testing program proposals are in principle formulated by the RPTFs;
(ii)    Annual Research Review (ARREV); ARREV meetings are scheduled annually to review
progress on the basis of NARI's Annual Reports, and to decide on priorities between
programs and on future directions; participants are decision makers from DAS/DLS,
collaborating NGOs and other scientific partners; NARB Research Review Committee
reports and findings concerning NARI programs should be available prior to ARREV
meetings; and
(iii) Program Advisory Committee (PAC); participants include: NARI's Director General, the
Assistant Director, the 7 program leaders and the head of STU; PAC is a steering
committee that advises the Director General on priorities, programs, policies and resource
allocations. PAC's recommendations on resource allocations are presented by the
Director General to NARB's Finance Committee, which in turn presents it with its own
recommendations to the full Board.

.Training Comt2n
1.           Formal training of staff of DAS, DLS, DOP, and DAR is insufficient to develop a
science-based agricultural research and extension system. Divisional management posiions (DACs) and
subject matter specialist positions cannot be filled with qualified people and therefore thuse vital finctions
have suffered in the past. Since the Gambia does not have an agricultural university, degree otining has
to be pursued abroad.
2.           The objective of the different Deparunents is to have key regional staff trained at the MSc
level and to have all SMS and training officers acquire over time a minimum standard of BSc. Front
line extension supervisory staff should have the Diploma in General Agriculture from the Gambb
College, School of Agriculture.
3.           Likely training institutions for degree-level targ abroad have been idetfied acwording
to disciplines (Nigeria-Ahmadou Bello University, Kenya-Egerton and Nairobi Univesity, UK-Wye
College, Holland-UnitersityofWageningen). Similarly, for short-term training in extension maagement,
monitoring and evaluation, statistics and use of computers, and in specific agricultual subject arm,
institutions have been identified (Institute for Low External Input Agriculture-ILEKA; Intnational
Statistical Programme Center-ISPC; and International Agricultural Research Centers-IARC).
4.           All training will be coordinated by the Deputy PS/Project Coordinator and be approved
by the Personnel Management Office (PMO) of the Presidency. The PMO assees trining needs in the
civil service and establishes training priorities in accordance with Government's developmet and
manpower priorities. Training abroad will only be supported if there is no possibility of an aopriate
programme in The Gambia. In order to reduce the loss of trained ciil servants to employment eswhero
in the economy, a bonding system has been introduced to deter staff from applying for posts outside
Govermnent for an agreed period following training, and which compensates Government finnclly
should they nevertheless do so. Results of training will be monitored and evaluated and taken ino
account in the annual training program.
5.           The objective of the orienion    gis to launch the projet and to introduco the
concept of coordinated crop and livestock extension services to the policy makers and the exoecut
agencies. This course would last for 2 days. A similar orientation program is also plannod for the
NGOs.
6.           Induction course for the regional staff would be aimed at making them understad tbhir
responsibilities under a coordinated extension system. The focus would be on how the various disciplin
work together to deliver to farmers an integrated set of massages coveing all disciplines rdated to
agriculture.
7.           Front line staff would meet regularly with the SMS and training officen (iXnlally once
a month subject to review later on the basis of experience) to be trained and to exchang viow on the
technical recommendations to be proposed to farmers ad to discuss farms' reactons.

THE GAMBIA
Supervision Plan
1.           IDA  contribution to supervision of the project would be closely linked to the
implementation schedule given in Annex 9. The staff input indicted in the table below is in addition to
regular supervision needs for the review of progress reports, procurement actions, correspondence, etc.
Estimated to require two staff weeks per year. It is also in addition to support missions carried out by
a Bank extension specialist stationed in Dakar, Senegal who will visit the Gambia 2-3 times a year.
Three supervision missions are planned during the first year of the project, and two missions per year
thereafter. The first supervision mission would be a project launching mission that would assist the
Borrower in meeting the conditions of project effectiveness and other preparatory tasks that need to be
performed for effectively launching the project. The second mission would ensure that the work program
and budget for the first year of the project is prepared and that the other departments of the Ministry of
Agriculture and other agencies are cooperating with the Department of Agricultural Extension Services
(DAES) in implementing the project. The third mission would be the beginning of the normal project
supervision. One of the regular supervision missions would take place in either November or December,
during which the results of the current calendar year would be assessed and the work program and budget
for the following calendar year would be discussed and agreed upon with the Borrower.
2.           Borrower's Contribution to Supervision.
(a)    Progress Reports are to be submitted as follows:
(i)    They should cover all parameters of crop and livestock extension (villages
covered, approximate number of beneficiaries, training, field trials, number of
functional literacy classes and number of participants, messages extended and
current issues with proposals how to solve them); agricultural research activities;
and project related activities of DOP and the Agricultural School of the Gambia
College;
(ii)   At the end of May and November of each year;
(iii)   By the Deputy Permanent Secretary, Programs and Projects, of the Ministry of
Agriculture who will coordinate report preparation by the participating
Departments (DAS, DLS, DAR and DOP).
(b)    Project monitoring wIll be the responsibility of each Department. The DPS/Project
Coordinator with the assistance of DOP wUI supervise the implementation of the
monitoring activities at all implementation levels.
(c)    Each department would prepare by February each year a work program for the next
agricultural season and submit this program together with a detailed budget for discussion
and approval to the DPS Project Coordinator. The DPS/Project Coordinator under the
authority of the Permanent Secretary Agriculture wIll, after discussion with the
implementing departments and needed adjustments, approve the program by mid-March.
The approved consolidated work program and budget would be submitted to IDA for

comments and approval not later than the end of March each year. By the end of June
of each year, the DPS/Project Coordinator would submit to IDA the audited project
accounts for the previous calendar year.
(d)    Mission briefing meetings on arrival will be chaired by the DPStProject Coordinator;
wrap-up meetings will normally be chaired by the Minister of Agriculture or his delegate.

generation and dissemination. The total cost of this staff, at an average salary and benefit cost
of $1,500, is $300,000/year. Most of this staff receive too little funds for mobility, training and
other operating costs. Exceptions are to be found in some donor-financed projects.
2.    Incremental Costs. Inspection of project cost tables shows that incremental recurrent
costs of extension and research will be US$6.0 million over the five years, or an annual average
of US$1.2 million, including vehicle and equipment replacement. These costs suffice to render
effective 300 field staff. Incremental cost per field staff averages USS4,000 or about 2.7 times
the salary and benefit costs. Since the non-personnel cost of good, i.e. mobile and continuously-
trained staff, is so large, these expenditures will have to be carefully managed and monitored,
whereby best practices can be identified and transferred to other areas and agencies.
3.    Aggregate Breakeven Benefits. Any aggregate approach is subject to undue simplicity,
and averaging over diverse local circumstances. Despite these limitations, an aggregate approach
yields an order of magnitude for breakeven benefits that can be a useful, albeit imprecise,
indicator of plausibility. Thus, with (i) a total rural population of US$550,000, and (ii) rural
GDP/head of US$120, project incremental costs are about 1.85% of the rural GDP. Since the
project will cover practically all of the rural population, the project incremental costs are about
1.85% of the GDP of the target population. To break even, the project must increase this target
population's income by 1.85% per year of what would be the case without the project. This
increase seems attainable when compared with long-term growth of rural income, or with the
productivity increases observed, albeit on small plots, under The Gambia - ADP-II Project over
the past several years. If staff salary and benefit costs are also included, total annual cost would
increase by US$300,000 to US$1.56 million/year, or 2.4% of the rural GDP. Income increases
of this magnitude also seem attainable.
4.    Break-even Benefits at the Farm Enterprise Level. As above, any attempt to average over
diverse local circumstances will conceal the heterogeneity of local conditions and thereby provide
a possibly misleading indication of median incomes. Nonetheless, an average approach to break-
even enterprise benefits yields a useful order-of-magnitude indicator of plausibility. Thus:

d/ Low is 20% increase in value added; this is the same as the incremental cost per Target Farm

eJ High is 40% increase in value added, or more than double line 4.
5.    These breakeven benefits show that the incremental cost (US$17/year) is covered if the
Target Farm Enterprises put in an additional 0.25 ha test plot each year. Clearly, some
enterprises will rapidly expand the test plot to most or all of their area, i.e. full adoption.
Equally clearly, some enterprises will not put in any test plots, because they have no labor, no
manure, no traction capacity, no access to credit or inputs, no security of tenure, nor means for
risk-sharing.  The median outcome is indeed uncertain, and subject to different factor
endowments of different enterprises, but it suffices that 0.25 ha out of the 3 ha farm (or 8%) is
farmed with test plot techniques each year to cover the incremental costs (or 4% in the high
case). If staff salary and benefit costs are also included, total cost per Target Farm Enterprise
would be US$22/year, and it would suffice that 10% of the land is put to test plots each year to
cover the full cost.
6.    The uncertainties underscore the need for careful monitoring of benefits - not only the
number of test plots (and new tests), but also the rate of expansion (or true 'adoption") of the
techniques tried out on the test plots. Costs must also be carefully managed and monitored so
that best practices can be identified and transferred to other areas and agencies. It will be by
working on both the benefit MX cost sides of the breakeven calculation that the net benefit will
be maximized.
