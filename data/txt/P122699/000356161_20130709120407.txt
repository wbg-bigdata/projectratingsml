F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The operation's Development Objective is to assist the Government in promoting social
development and inclusion, while maintaining a sustainable medium term fiscal
framework. In particular, the operation supports the Government's efforts aimed at: (i)

                                                ii
Creating fiscal space for needed social expenditure by supporting actions to increase tax
revenues and to improve efficiency and transparency in the allocation of public resources;
and (ii) Protecting and including vulnerable segments of the population by allocating
additional public resources towards social programs targeting vulnerable groups such as
the elderly, women, and children.

Implementation Completion and Results Report for a Public Finance and Social
Progress Development Policy Loan to the Republic of El Salvador

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

This Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) describe the results of
the Public Finance and Social Progress Development Policy Loan (DPL) to the
Republic of El Salvador. The single tranche loan of US$100 million was approved by
the World Bank Board of Executive Directors on June 2, 2011 and disbursed upon loan
effectiveness on September 7, 2011. The operation supported strategic areas addressed by
two previous DPLs: the Public Finance and Social Sector (PFSS) approved on January 2,
2009 that focused on strengthening the medium-term fiscal sustainability and supporting
transparency in the use of public resources and the Sustained Social Gains for Economic
Recovery Program (SSGER) approved on November 24, 2009 that supported the process
of economic recovery through the design of initiatives and institutional strengthening in
the social sectors.

The operation supported the Government objective of promoting social
development and inclusion, while maintaining a sustainable medium term fiscal
framework. In particular, the operation supported the Government's efforts aimed at: (i)
Creating fiscal space for needed social expenditure by reinforcing actions to improve tax
collection, expand the tax base, increase tax revenues and improve efficiency and
transparency in the allocation of public resources; and, (ii) Protecting and including
vulnerable segments of the population by allocating additional public resources towards
social programs targeting vulnerable groups such as the elderly and children in poor areas.

This operation was designed as the first of a series of two development policy loans,
but the second operation in the series was not completed. The actions supported by
this operation, as well as results indicators and targets were conceived as part of a broader
program, including follow up reforms supported by a second loan. However, changes in
the economic and political context led the Bank team to delay the preparation of the
second operation. As a result, the DPL series lapsed and this loan became a stand-alone
operation. On the economic side, weak external and low GDP growth contributed to a
slower pace of fiscal consolidation and the interruption of the IMF program in the
country. On the political side, a mid-term election changed the political composition in
Congress affecting the Government’s support and its ability to approve loans and reforms.
Despite the difficult context, El Salvador’s Government remained committed with the
objectives of the program. The country implemented most of the reforms contemplated as
indicative triggers for the second operation and achieved most targets envisaged for the
complete DPL series, despite the absence of the second loan.

1.1 Country Context at Appraisal

Appraisal took place approximately two years after president Mauricio Funes came
to power. The national political stage is dominated by two main political parties – the
National Republic Alliance Party (ARENA) and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation

                                             1
Front Party (FMLN). ARENA held the executive branch of the Government from 1991
until March 2009, when the FMLN candidate, Mauricio Funes, won the presidential
election. The FMLN’s victory, after 20 years in the opposition, and the smooth handover
of political power were milestones in the country’s political history. Nevertheless, the
political environment remained polarized.

Economic developments prior to appraisal

El Salvador’s economic performance was relatively strong in the 2000s until the country
was hit by the global crisis. Over the period 2005-2007, economic growth improved
steadily from 3.6 percent to 3.8 percent following an improvement in the external
environment. Growth was driven mainly by rising remittances, which accounted on
average for 18.2 percent of GDP and became a major source of financing for
consumption and investment. The mid-2000s were also characterized by improvements
on the fiscal front. Revenue increased by 1.1 percent of GDP between 2005 and 2007,
while spending was maintained at 19.3 percent of GDP in the same period. As a result,
the non- financial public sector deficit narrowed from 3.0 percent of GDP in 2005 to
2.0 percent in 2007. Growth also contributed to improvements in the social indicators.
By 2007, about 35 percent of Salvadoran households were poor, including about 11
percent extremely poor (versus 60 percent and 28 percent, respectively, in 1991). In
addition, access to basic services such as safe water and sanitation increased by more
than 15 percentage points during that period.
The global financial crisis severely affected El Salvador. The crisis, and in particular
the U.S. recession, impacted the economy, which contracted by 3.1 percent in 2009. The
contraction was driven by a sharp fall in remittances (which decreased by about 10%),
the collapse in consumption and investment (that fell by 8.6 and 14.8 % respectively),
and reduced foreign demand (exports fell by 15%). The slowdown in economic activity
led to an increasingly tight fiscal situation. Tax revenues dropped from 13.5 percent of
GDP in 2008 to 12.6 percent in 2009, while expenditures remained broadly stable. As a
result, the overall fiscal deficit increased from 3.2 percent of GDP in 2008 to 5.7 percent
in 2009 while the debt-to-GDP ratio rose from 41 to 50 percent. Social indicators also
deteriorate. The poverty rate increase to 40 percent in 2008 and remained relatively high
at 37.8 percent in 2009.

At the time of appraisal, the Salvadoran economy was starting to recover, but the
speed of the recovery was uncertain. The economy grew 0.7 percent in 2010, below
expectations. The pace of recovery in El Salvador depended on the dynamics of the U.S.
economy and other potential external shock such as a significant increase in commodity
prices. El Salvador’s fiscal balance also improved in 2010. Public spending increased 3.3
percent reaching 21.8 percent of the GDP, while tax revenues increased almost 10.4
percent in the same period reaching 13.3 percent of GDP. The overall fiscal public sector
deficit ended 2010 at 4.2 percent of GDP, well below projections. The debt sustainability
analysis (DSA) indicated that the medium-term public debt position was sustainable, but
sensitive to an economic slowdown and to lack of fiscal consolidation.

1.2 Country context during implementation

Structural reforms and external loans were successfully approved by the National
Assembly despite the political polarization, but the results of the March 2012 mid-
term election affected this trend. Although the Government’s party did not hold a
majority in Congress, it was able to reach agreement on a series of important reforms and
loans such as the 2011 tax reforms, procurement Law reform, the approval of the access
to information Law, and a US$650 million debt rollover in 2011. However, the results of
the March 2012 mid-term elections changed the composition of Congress and increased
the number of seats held by the opposition party, allowing the opposition to block the
approval of multilateral loans, as the Government lost the two-third majority.

The country continued recovering from the crisis but at a slow pace. The recovery
has been subject to a weak external environment and other exogenous shocks. El

                                                     3
Salvador’s GDP grew by 1.4 percent in 2010, and approximately 2.0 percent in 2011. In
2012, the heavy rains and the repercussion of the Euro debt crisis led to a reduction in
growth to 1.6 percent. As the economy resumed growth in 2010-2011, imports recovered
and the current account deficit increased from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to 4.6 percent
in 2011 and to 5.3 percent of GDP in 2012 due to a decrease in exports. Social outcomes
improved modestly in line with the economic recovery, but remained below pre-crisis
levels. The poverty rate reached 36.5 percent in 2010, increased in 2011 to over 40
percent, but decreased in 2012 to 34.5 percent, due in part to successful government
programs targeting the most vulnerable groups of the population.

The fiscal consolidation continued, but at a slower pace. The overall fiscal deficit
decreased from 4.3 percent of GDP in 2010 to 3.9 percent of GDP in 2011 and 2012. Tax
measures by the central administration led to an increase in tax revenues from 12.6 of
GDP in 2009 to 13.8 and 14.4 percent in 2011 and 2012, surpassing the pre-crisis level
due to a more effective tax administration. The potential benefits of the increase in tax
revenues had been partially compensated by expenditures which edged up to 22.2 and
22.4 percent of GDP in 2011 and 2012, respectively, following spending pressures from
the impact of the tropical depression, subsidies, and security. The debt-to-GDP ratio rose
to 51.7 percent of GDP in 2011 and to 53.7 percent in 2012.

Looking forward, prospects for economic growth are still uncertain. Recovery in El
Salvador continues to be tied to the dynamics of the U.S. economy. Current projections
foresee growth of 1.6 percent in 2013 and 2014. Inflation is expected to remain under
control in the medium term. Following a drop in commodity prices, inflation slowed
down to about 0.8 percent in 2012 and would remain close to 2.5 percent for the period
2013-2014.

Despite the challenging fiscal situation, projections suggest a sustainable medium-
term fiscal outlook. El Salvador’s Development Plan proposed a sustainable medium
term fiscal framework and authorities remain committed to fiscal sustainability. The
Government designed a fiscal reform program for 2013, including measures to further
reduce expenditures and increase revenue collection with the objective of reducing the
fiscal deficit. Fiscal projections assume that the Government will continue to implement
the intended measures, suggesting a low but continued increase in tax revenues, linked
with the implementation of tax reforms, reaching 15.3 percent in 2013 and 15.5 percent
of GDP in 2014. This would bring the overall fiscal deficit down slightly to 3.8 percent of
GDP in 2014.

1.3 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The operation’s Development Objective was to assist the Government in promoting
social development and inclusion, while maintaining a sustainable medium term
fiscal framework.




                                                 5
In particular, the operation supported the Government’s efforts aimed at:

(i)     Creating fiscal space for needed social expenditure by supporting actions to
increase tax revenues and to improve efficiency and transparency in the allocation of
public resources.

(ii)    Protecting and including vulnerable segments of the population by allocating
additional public resources towards social programs targeting vulnerable groups such as
the elderly, women, and children in poor areas.

The Key Economic Indicators, expected to be achieved by December 2012, under
the two policy areas mentioned above, were the following:

I.         Improving efficiency in tax collection and expanding the tax base

              Decrease by 50 percent the number of income tax returns filed by DGII by the
               first quarter of 2013 from a baseline of 446,005 tax returns in 2009
              Increase of the share of payments to the Government made through P@GOES
               from 5.25 percent in 2008 to 9.5 percent in 2012.

II.        Increasing tax revenues through tax administration actions and fiscal reforms

              Increase of 40 basis points of tax revenues as percent of GDP by 2012 as a
               result of tax administration measures from a baseline of 13.3 percent which
               was the average for the period 2006-2008.
              Increase of total tax revenues from 13.3 percent of GDP to 14.8 percent in
               2012.

III.       Increasing efficiency, transparency and accountability in the allocation of public
           resources

              Increase in the Government cash balances monitored by DGT’s system from
               US$ 91.9 million in 2009 to US$ 175 million in 2012.
              10 percent of commonly used goods and services are purchased though
               Framework Agreements in 2012 from a 2009 baseline where no framework
               agreement was used.
              By 2012, no payments to awarded contracts has been made, unless the
               business opportunity and results were published in COMPRASAL in due time

IV.        Protecting vulnerable groups

          Each region of the country has at least one functioning consulting committee for
           monitoring progress with respect to gender equity in the public sector; and a
           functioning window for information on women’s rights by January 2013. As of
           October 2009 there were no functioning consulting committees, nor windows for
           information.

                                               6
      At least 80 percent of the targeted elderly individuals in the 52 poorest rural
       municipalities and 2 poor urban municipalities receive cash transfers by January
       2013. As of October 2009 no targeted elderly individuals received cash transfers.
      At least 2000 students of primary and secondary education are studying under a
       full-school day period modality by January 2013. As of October 2009, no student
       studied under full-school day period modality.

1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification

There were no revisions to the program development objectives or the core outcome
indicators.

1.5 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

The DPL series is designed around two pillars covering four policy areas connected
to key priorities in the Government’s development plan (see Annex 1). The first
pillar, creating fiscal space for needed social spending comprises three main policy areas:
(i) improving efficiency in tax collection and expanding the tax base; (ii) increasing tax
revenues; and (iii) promoting efficiency, transparency and accountability in the allocation
of public resources. The first pillar is directly linked with the Government’s five-year
development plan to increase taxes, increase transparency and efficiency in the allocation
of public resources and reduce public debt. The second pillar, protecting and socially
including vulnerable groups, is linked to the policy area of protecting vulnerable groups,
such as woman, elderly individuals and children in poor regions. This policy area is
linked with the Government’s five-year development plan objective to reverse the rise in
poverty and expand basic social services to vulnerable segments of the population.

Pillar I: Creating Fiscal Space for Needed Social Spending
This pillar supported the Government efforts to improve efficiency in tax collection
and expanding the tax base; to increase tax revenues through tax administration
actions and fiscal reform; and to increase the efficiency, transparency and
accountability in the allocation of public resources. The program set seven outcome
indicators under this pillar (Annex 1).
Tax revenues in El Salvador are among the lowest in LAC and they are not sufficient to
finance needed social spending. The global crisis and the slowdown in economic activity
further worsened the situation as revenues fell by 0.7 percent of GDP and spending need
increased. In its efforts expand revenue collection, the Government defined a strategy
involving a combination of tax administration and tax policy reforms that would include
several actions under the DPL. In particular, the operation supported the strengthening,
modernization, and coordination between three tax agencies: Internal Revenue Agency
(DGII), the Customs Agency (DGA), and the Ministry of Finance’s Treasury Office
(DGT). In parallel, the Government promoted actions to improve the efficiency in
spending allocation by shifting resources from non-priority spending areas; to improve
resource management and planning; to increase accountability. Actions included the

                                            7
centralized monitoring and management of public sector account, and the approval of a
comprehensive Access to Information and Transparency Law/

Pillar II: Protecting and Including Vulnerable Segments of the Population.

This pillar was aimed to support the Government efforts to reduce social exclusion
and poverty incidence among specific vulnerable groups such as women, elderly and
children. As shown in Annex 1, there are three outcome indicators under this pillar.

Despite the progress achieved during the last decade, poverty and social exclusion are
still relatively high compared to pre-crisis levels. Poverty incidence is even higher among
specific vulnerable groups (women, elderly and children) which are also among the most
affected by external shocks and economic downturns. The Government strategy to protect
vulnerable households has been focused on expanding effective and well-targeted safety
net programs such as the Cash Transfer Program (Comunidades Solidarias) that supports
the consumption of poor rural households and increases their children’s access to basic
health, nutrition and education services.

This DPL continued supporting policies and programs targeting vulnerable segments of
the populations. Taking advantage of the targeting mechanisms developed for
Comunidades Solidarias, the Government implemented a new program of monetary
transfers to poor elderly individuals, which was supported by the operation. This
component also supported the Government efforts to promote gender equality by
improving the protection of women, and approving the Law on Equality, Equity and
Eradication of Discrimination against Women (2011) that aims at fighting discrimination
against women and promoting gender equality; and to publish the Special Integral Law
for a Life Free of Violence for Women (2011) aimed at protecting women from violence.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

Upon the completion of all prior actions, the Public Finance and Social Progress
DPL was approved by the Board on June 2, 2011 and signed on July 27, 2011. The
single tranche operation became effective on September 7, 2011 and was closed on
December 31, 2012. This DPL was the first in a proposed series of two single-tranche
programmatic Development Policy Loans (DPLs), but the processing of the second
operation was delayed and the series lapsed. It is important to highlight that the
government implemented the program actions contemplated as trigger for the second
DPL, even though the operation was not completed. (Annex 1)

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

The following factors have affected the implementation of the program:
Political Context: The results of the March 2012 mid-term elections and change in the
composition of Congress affected implementation. The result of the election intensified
the political polarization in the country. Prior to elections, the Government had been able
to approve important structural reforms contemplated as an indicative trigger for the
second operation, such as comprehensive tax reform, prior to the election. However, after
the mid-term election, it was difficult to make progress in issues such as further targeting
of subsidies and social programs. This situation contributed to a slower pace of fiscal
consolidation. In addition, the increase in the number of seats held by the opposition
party allowed the opposition to block loan approvals.

Economic context: During implementation of the operation the Salvadoran economy
was affected by internal and external shocks. In October 2011, the country was affected
by heavy rains that led to important losses on infrastructure and production. The country

                                                  10
was also affected by strong fluctuations in commodity prices and the deterioration in the
external economic environment following the European debt crisis. These factors
impaired growth prospects and imposed fiscal pressures through additional spending,
which also contributed to a slowdown in the pace of fiscal consolidation. The fiscal
deficit fell to 4 percent in 2011 and to 3.9 percent in 2012, instead of the 3.5 percent and
2.7 percent expected initially. This result against the backdrop of a complicated political
context and difficulty implementing stronger consolidation measures led the IMF
program to lapse.

Despite factors affecting implementation of the operation, the program benefited from:

Previous Legal Reforms: The Assembly, through Decree No. 534 dated December 10,
2010 approved the Law on Access to Public Information to improve transparency and
access to public information; through Decree No. 645 dated March 7, 2011 approved the
Law on Equality, Equity and Eradication of Discrimination against Women, to fight
discrimination against women and promoting gender equality; and through Decree No.
520 dated November 25, 2010, approved the Special Integral Law for a Life Free of
Violence for Women, to protect women from violence. Implementation also benefited
from reforms approved in preparation for the second DPL, such as the 2011 tax reform,
the enactment and implementation of a reform to the Tax Law, and the Customs
Simplification Law.

Consultation with other donors: The DPL was prepared with extensive consultation
with the IMF and IADB. The purpose of these consultations was three-fold. First, the
meetings intended to promote knowledge sharing and inform participants about the latest
analytical work developed by each institution, especially in the areas of tax management,
tax policy and public expenditure. Second, the meetings provided an opportunity for
coordinating efforts and avoiding overlaps in actions support by the different institutions.
Finally, the meetings helped to tune messages and recommendations provided by the
different institutions.

Government consultations: Finally, the Government has consulted closely with other
political and civil society actors during the preparation of the DPL. Taking into account
El Salvador’s political context and the potential risk associated with the approval of
reform, the Government had promoted consultation on key policies supported by the
operation. The Bank continued assisting the Government in the consultation process
helping mitigate the risks associated with the approval of the operation in Congress.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

Design, implementation and utilization: Outcome indicators, baseline values, and
targets were assigned to each of the four policy areas defined under the DPL program.
The design focused on output and outcome indicators that were easy to calculate and that
were expected to be achieved by December 2012, closing date of the operation. The
M&E sought to align output indicators to indicators and targets frequently monitored by
the Government, such as the number of income tax returns filed by DGII, the share of

                                            11
payments to the Government made through P@GOES, the tax revenues as percent of
GDP and the Government balances monitored by the DGT’s system.

The Ministry of Finance was responsible for the implementation of the program
supported by the DPL as well as for coordinating actions among the concerned line
agencies, including, in particular, the Central Bank, the Technical Secretariat of the
Presidency (for aspects concerning the implementation of social programs), the Ministry
of Education (for aspects concerning the education sector) and the Ministry of Health (for
aspects concerning the health sector).
Together with the Ministry of Finance, these institutions collected the necessary
data to assess and report on implementation progress, taking into account both
process advances and service statistics, survey and other data that has been used to
assess the achievement of the outcome indicators.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

Even though the second DPL was not completed, activities carried out during the
preparation helped sustain engagement and supported program implementation.
The second DPL in the series developed until appraisal. The analytical and technical
work developed during preparation helped inform policy discussion in different areas,
such as subsidy targeting, distribution impacts of tax reform, and fiscal rules. This work
contributed to the implementation of most indicative triggers for the second operation and
continuation of the program beyond the approval of the second loan.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The policy areas of support under this DPL remain relevant. The DPL was prepared
while El Salvador was starting to recover from the impact of the global crisis. Preparation
took place shortly after the release of the Government Development Plan and was
directly linked to its objectives (see Section 1.5). The program supported by the
operation remained relevant and helped the Government through a complicated political
and economic environment. In fact, the program continued being implemented despite
the lack of a second DPL.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Overall, El Salvador has made significant progress toward meeting the target
outcomes, but the program was not fully successful in achieving all development
objectives. The PDOs were to assist the Government in promoting social development
and inclusion by creating fiscal space for social expenditure, while maintaining a
sustainable medium-term fiscal framework. The PDO focused on ten outcome indicators
under four policy areas, for which the program could be held accountable given the scope
of the operation. The DPL fully met six out of ten outcome indicators, and partially met
two indicators. Annex 1 details the status of the outcomes as of the closing of the

                                            12
operation. The outcomes and current status of each indicator under each pillar are also
discussed below.

Policy Area I.1: Improving efficiency in tax collection and expanding the tax base

Outcome Indicator 1:The number of income tax returns filed by DGII was expected to
decrease by 50 percent from a baseline of 445.005 tax returns in 2009 (equivalent to 84
percent of total tax files), to 223.002 by the first quarter of 2013. This indicator should
track the impact of a reform, implemented in 2012, based on the adjustment of the table
of tax retentions for wage earners and tax exception of small non labor income. As of
April 2013 the number of income tax returns filed by DGII was 374,004, a decrease of 35
percent compared to April 2012 (575,819). The tax reform did not reduce the number of
income tax returns filed by the DGII by 50 percent with respect to the baseline, due to
delays in the implementation of tax system reforms, but made progress towards the
proposed decrease. (Not achieved)

Outcome Indicator 2: The share of payments to the Government made through
P@GOES was expected to increase from 5.25 percent in 2008 to 9.5 percent in 2012.
This DPL supported actions for improving efficiency in tax collection and expanding the
tax base included in the El Salvador electronic payment platform (P@GOES), thus
reducing tax collection costs and helping improve coordination. As of December 2012
the payments made to the Government through the platform for electronic payments
P@GOES was 30.1 percent. This result surpassed the target in terms of percentage of
total payments to the government (Achieved)

Policy Area I.2: Increasing tax revenues through tax administration actions and
fiscal reform

Outcome Indicator 1: Tax revenues as percent of GDP have increased 40 basis points
by 2012 as a result of tax administration measures from a baseline of 13.3 percent for
the period 2006-2008, prior to the economic crisis. As of December 2012 the tax
revenue as percent of GDP increased by 1.1 percentage points, with respect to the
baseline average of 13.3 percent for 2006-2008, mainly as a result of tax administration
measures and custom revenue efforts and not due to tax rate increases (Achieved)

Outcome Indicator 2: Total tax revenues have increased from an average of 13.3
percent of GDP in 2006-2008 to 14.8 percent in 2012. In 2012 net tax revenues to GDP
were 14.4 percent, an improvement compared to the average of 13.3 percent of GDP for
2006-2008, but not sufficient to meet the target of 14.8 percent due to external and
internal conditions that lowered economic activity. (Partially achieved)

Policy Area I.3: Increasing efficiency, transparency and accountability in the
allocation of public resources

Outcome Indicator 1: The Government balances monitored by DGT’s system
increased from US$91.9 million in 2009 to US$175 million in 2012. As of December

                                            13
2012, Government balances supervised by the DGT system rose from $91.9 million in
2008 to $122.54 million in 2012 (Not Achieved)

Outcome Indicator 2: Ten percent of common used goods and services were expected
to be purchased through framework Agreements in 2012 from a baseline in 2009
where no framework agreement was used. The National Assembly did not approve Art 4
of the reform proposed by the Executive containing the Framework Agreements. For this
reason, during the preparation of the second operation the Bank was considering a
revision to this indicator (Not Achieved).

Outcome Indicator 3: No payments to awarded contracts has been made in 2012
unless the business opportunity and results were published in COMPRASAL in due
time. By linking the publication of procurement opportunities with payments, the
Government would ensure that 100 percent of bidding opportunities are published online.
As of December 2012 transparency over public resources management has been
significantly improved with the publication of the results and conditions for all public
contracts. Additionally, the government implemented in 2012 a mechanism that ensures
that no contract can be paid unless results are published in the portal. (Achieved)

Policy Area II Protecting vulnerable groups

Outcome Indicator 1: Each region of the country has at least one functioning
consulting committee for monitoring progress with respect to gender equity in the
public sector and a functioning window for information on women’s rights by January
2013. As of October 2009 there were no functioning consulting committees or windows
for information. As of December 2012, there were 14 functioning consulting
committees monitoring progress in gender equality in the public sector, and 11 regions of
the country had at least one functioning information window on women rights.
Additionally, there were 570 mobile operational information windows at the country
level. (Achieved)

Outcome Indicator 2: At least 80 percent of the target elderly individuals in the 52
poorest rural municipalities and 2 urban municipalities receive cash transfers by
January 2013. As of October 2009, no targeted elderly individuals received cash
transfers. Cash transfer programs for elderly individuals cover more than the number of
municipalities targeted at project inception, including the poorest departments in the
country. In fact, as of January 2013, 80 percent of the elderly individuals in 75
municipalities receive cash transfers, which include the 52 poorest of the rural area. The
CT program was not extended to urban municipalities. (Achieved)

Outcome Indicator 3: At least 2000 students of primary and secondary education are
studying under the full-school day period modality by January 2013. (Baseline: No
student studied under full-school day period in October 2009. By January 2013,
approximately 10,356 students are studying under the extended-day modality and an
approximate of 16,968 students are studying under indirect modality, in
53 full-day inclusive schools. (Achieved)

                                           14
3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The program supported by the DPL series was almost fully implemented, even though the
second DPL did not materialize. This contributed to further progress towards the PDO
and improvements in almost all results indicators.

Progress under pillar one was partial. Most targets related to improving efficiency in
tax collection and increasing efficiency and transparency in the allocation of public
resources were fully achieved. By December 2012, the payments made to the
Government through P@GOES reached 30.1 percent and transparency over public
resources management significantly improved with the publication of the results and
conditions for all public contracts. Results related to revenues collection were also strong,
although below target. The number of income tax returns filed by DGII decrease 17
percent (instead of 50 percent); tax revenues increase to 14.4 percent of GDP (instead of
14.8 percent) in large due to tax administration measure. It was not possible to increase
significantly the amount of Government balances monitored by the DGT, or get the
approval from the National Assembly to implement framework agreements for the
purchases of goods and services.

Pillar two was successfully implemented. Important progress was made in protecting
vulnerable groups by: implementing 14 functioning consulting committees monitoring
progress in gender equality in the public sector and creating in 11 regions of the country
at least one functioning information window on women rights; expanding the cash
transfer to 80 percent of the target elderly individuals in 75 municipalities, including the
52 poorest rural municipalities; and increasing to 10,356 the number of students under
the extended-day modality and to approximately 16,968 the students studying under
indirect modality, in 53 full-day inclusive schools.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The actions for strengthening the country’s fiscal position supported by this DPL
were expected to have a positive overall distributional impact. The latest PER
indicated that high public debt has adversely impacted the poor by reducing fiscal space
for priority social spending and investment programs. The gains in poverty reduction
achieved during the previous decade were partially reversed by the crisis. The poverty
rate reached 40 percent at the end of 2008 and remained relatively high at 37.8 percent in
2009. The operation supported Government efforts to protect the poor and vulnerable
groups and included legislative actions aimed at improving gender equality. In the wake
of the Government efforts, and despite a challenging external and economic environment,
poverty and extreme poverty rates were reduced to 34.5 and 8.9 percent of GDP
respectively. There has also been significant progress made in protecting vulnerable



                                             15
groups in rural areas by increasing the coverage of the CT program to 80 percent of the
eligible elders in 75 rural municipalities.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The DPL helped promoting institutional changes by supporting actions: to improve
efficiency in tax collection by strengthening DGII’s institutional capacity; to increase tax
revenues through tax and custom administration actions; and to increase efficiency and
transparency in the allocation of public resources given the low levels of tax revenues,
increasing pressures from public services delivery, and the adverse effects of external
shocks that have limited the financing needed for needed social investments. These
actions are fully consistent with the objective of strengthening fundamentals for
economic recovery by addressing macro and institutional vulnerabilities. Finally, this
operation supported actions towards the protection of vulnerable groups such as
designing and implementing a cash transfer system to elderly individuals in the poorest
municipalities. Moreover, institutional strengthening continued as the government
proceeded with the implementation of prior actions for the second DPL

N/A

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Moderate

Rating: Moderate

Political risks: The polarized political climate in El Salvador continues to be a potential
obstacle to approve reforms and loans. In addition, the upcoming presidential elections
(March 2014) further increase tensions and might impose spending pressures, slowing
fiscal consolidation. The difficult political context may affect the ability to continue
making progress towards the PDO, but the Government commitment remains, and it is
unlikely that the results achieved so far would be reverted.

Macroeconomic risks: The prolonged global deceleration and higher volatility continue
to impose risks to the El Salvador economy. The potential impacts on the country are
similar to the ones associated with the 2008 financial crisis, including low growth, fiscal,
social and financial pressures. In some fronts, El Salvador is now better prepared to
mitigate the impact of a crisis. Since 2008 the Government has expanded social
protection programs and safety nets. In addition, the Government has strengthened the
financial sector monitoring and crisis preparedness. In other fronts El Salvador’s position
is more vulnerable. Economic growth remains low and, despite fiscal consolidation
efforts, the public debt and fiscal accounts are still higher than its pre-2008 levels.



                                            16
Natural disasters risks. El Salvador is highly vulnerable to multiple natural disasters
risks –floods, hurricanes and earthquakes. A major climatic or seismic disaster poses a
significant threat to economic growth and fiscal stability and can delay the Government’s
program. In fact, the latest prolonged tropical storms had significant economic impacts
(up to US$850 million). The Government efforts to strengthening disaster management
systems help prevent fatalities, but after the full disbursement of the CAT-DDO (US$50
million), the Government counts with fewer instruments for immediate emergency
responses. The occurrence of a major natural disaster could imply a reassessment of the
country’s development priorities (at least temporarily) and delays progress towards the
medium term development objectives.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
   Rating: Satisfactory

The design of the DPL was appropriate, timely, and relevant for addressing the
challenges faced by the country given external and internal developments, including the
risks associated with the polarized political climate. The DPL was designed in close
collaboration with the Government to ensure that actions supported by the operation were
fully consistent with the country’s long term development goals, in particular, creating
fiscal space needed for sustainable social spending, enhancing the social gains achieved
during the last decade and protecting vulnerable segments of the population. Moreover,
the design of the Public Finance and Social Progress DPL benefited from the findings and
recommendations of previous analytical pieces such as the Public Expenditure Review
(2010) and the Public Financial Management Performance Measurement Framework
(FY09), which explain the link between the analytical findings and the policy actions
supported by this DPL.

(b) Quality of Supervision
    Rating: Satisfactory

Supervision was carried formally through three supervision missions that followed the
Ministry of Finance and the Bank agreement settled during project preparation. These
reviews are summarized in three Implementation Status and Results (ISR). The first
supervision mission took place on August 2011 with the purpose of monitoring the
government's progress towards targeted outcomes. During this first mission the Bank
documented improvements on most outcome indicators, with the exception of the fiscal
pact. The fiscal reform prepared by the Ministry of Finance had not been presented to the
Social and Economic Council for consultations at that time. The second and third
supervision missions took place in April and December 2012. The Program Performance
was considered satisfactory by the first two ISRs, however during the third supervision
mission the progress towards achievement of PDO was rated as moderately satisfactory
due to the slowdown in fiscal consolidation (fiscal deficit fell to 3.9 percent instead of the



                                             17
3.5 percent initially projected), and positive but slower progress in some of the result
indicators.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

The operation supported relevant development objectives, and helped build consensus
around those issues. Supported issues, such as fiscal sustainability and efficiency and
protection and inclusion of vulnerable segments of the population, remain relevant
despite the adverse shocks that affected the Salvadoran economy during the
implementation period. Many aspects of Bank performance contributed to this outcome.
First, the continued engagement through analytical work and policy dialog helped the
implementation of the program supported by the DPL series. Second, the Bank
coordinated closely with other donors. Third, the operation correctly identified a number
of risks for program sustainability and helped mitigate them. Finally, the monitoring and
evaluation system in place allowed both the Government and the Bank to periodically
track progress toward the target outcomes.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Throughout the preparation and supervision process of the operation, the Ministry of
Finance coordinated with the different ministries and line agencies involved in the
operation including, DGA, DGII and DGT. The coordination was instrumental in shaping
the actions of each institution and ensuring the timely implementation of the multiple
prior actions under the program (Table 3). However, changes in the economic and
political context led the Bank team to delay the preparation of the second operation; the
DPL series lapsed and this loan became a stand-alone operation. On the economic side,
weak external and low GDP growth contributed to a slower pace of fiscal consolidation
and the interruption of the IMF program in the country. On the political side, mid-term
election changed the political composition in Congress affecting the Government’s
support and its ability to approved loans and sensitive reforms, further slowing fiscal
consolidation. Despite the difficult context, El Salvador’s Government remained
committed with the objectives of the program.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Ministry of Finance was the principal executing agency, responsible for the
implementation and overall coordination of the operation as agreed at the inception of the
program. The Ministry of Finance was responsible for the implementation as well as for
coordinating actions among the concerned line agencies, including, in particular, the
Central Bank, the Technical Secretariat of the Presidency (for social programs) and the
Ministry of Education (for the education sector).Together with the Ministry of Finance,
these institutions collected the data, sometimes with delays or incomplete, to assess

                                           18
implementation progress and report it to the Bank, taking into account both process
advances and service statistics, survey and other data used to assess the achievement of
the outcomes. Despite the difficult political and economic context, the Government
continued implementing the program supported by the operation and completed almost
all indicative triggers supported by the second operation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The borrower’s engagement during the preparation, implementation and supervision was
overall satisfactory. As described above, substantial progress was made in
implementation of the program. However, the slowdown in fiscal consolidation, driven
by political and economic challenges, affected the achievement of at three of the outcome
indicators and interfered with the completion of the DPL series.

6. Lessons Learned

Sustaining the dialogue on macroeconomic performance and the program of
reforms were critical for the outcome of a Development Policy Loan. This operation
was supposed to be the first of a series of two DPLs but ended up as a standalone
operation because of the complicate political and economic environment in the country.
The Bank continued engagement providing technical support and helping inform the
policy debate. Even though these efforts were not sufficient for the completion of the
second operation, they contribute to the implementation of the program of reforms and to
the fiscal consolidation debate in the country.

Sustained engagement developed knowledge and helped the Bank to respond with
flexibility to a changing country context. Despite the difficulties encountered in
obtaining approval of foreign borrowing in the Assembly, the Bank remained fully
engaged, contributing via analytical work, consensus building activities and
strategy/program development. The analytical work helped to identify gaps in specific
sectors and shortcomings that contributed to cope with the severe effects of the 2009
economic crisis, and was also critical for informing stakeholders and building consensus
around important development issues such as the targeting of subsidies, tax reform, and
the need for fiscal consolidation In particular, the two previous DPLs, the Public Finance
and Social Sector (2009) that focused in strengthening the medium-term fiscal
sustainability and supporting transparency in the use of public resources; the Sustained
Social Gains for Economic Recovery Program (2009) that supported the design of
initiatives and institutional strengthening in the social sectors; and the PER (2010) that
provided great support to the DPL series.

This DPL was one of the first DPLs to successfully support a gender reform agenda.
The National Development identified gender equity as an important challenge for El
Salvador. Taking advantage of this favorable context, the Bank team supported the
Government in the preparation and approval of two important laws, the Gender Equity
Law and Women’s Protection against Violence Law. Gender was introduced to the DPL

storyline within a strategy to protect vulnerable segments of the population, and it was
appreciated internally at the Bank and by the counterparts in the country. The political
climate in El Salvador can impede the approval of reforms.

Political risks materialized during implementation which made it difficult to achieve
expenditure and revenue targets. The most recent mid-term elections changed the
composition of Congress, allowing the opposition to block the two-third majority
required by El Salvador’s constitution to approve new legislation and loans. Although the
Government tried to mitigate this risk by intensifying consultation on policy reforms and
by explaining the content of the reform to the different stakeholders involved in the
political process, they were not able to fully obtain the results. The political situation
became even more complicated in the lead up to the Presidential election.

Annex 3. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

On behalf of the Government of El Salvador, the Minister of Finance expressed its
agreement with the content of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) in a letter to
the Resident Representative in El Salvador dated June 12, 2013. The letter includes
comments and observations that are summarized below:

The Government has reviewed the ICR and believes it reflects well the process of
implementation and the results of the program. The financial resources of the operation
have been of great relevance to assist the Government in creating fiscal space for needed
social expenditure by supporting actions to increase tax revenues and to improve
efficiency and transparency in the allocation of public resources; and in protecting and
including vulnerable segments of the population by allocating additional public resources
towards social programs targeting vulnerable groups such as the elderly, women, and
children. In this regard, the technical and financial assistance of the World Bank
continues to be critical to finance needed social spending for the most vulnerable groups
of the population and to contribute to the social agenda of the current Administration.

Based on the experience of this first Public Finance and Social Progress Development
Policy Loan, the Government of El Salvador reaffirms the convenience of single-tranche
operations due to its quick disbursement.

With regard to the results of the operation, the Ministry of Finance believes that outcome
indicators 1 and 5, related to the number of income tax returns filed by DGII and the
Government balances monitored by DGT, have been partially achieved given the
progress made. This advance is reflected in a decrease of 16.1 percent of income tax
returns versus the target of 50 percent; and the increase of US$30.6 million of
Government balances monitored by DGT, versus the targets of US$83.1 million.

Finally, in relation to indicator 6, the lack of implementation of framework agreements
for the purchases of goods and services was due to the non-approval of legal reforms
submitted by the Executive to the National Assembly. Therefore the Government
concludes that in future operations there should be a more pragmatic identification of
outcome indicators to avoid non compliance
