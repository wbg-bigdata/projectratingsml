MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INIERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO CHINA
DOR THE SECOND SHUXKOU HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommenda-
*         tion on a proposed loan to China for the equivalent of $100 million to help
finance the Second Shuikou Hydroelectric Project. The loan would be at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including
*         five years of grace, with level principal repayments.  The proceeds of the
loan would be onlent to Fujian Provincial Electric Power Bureau (FPEPB) for 20
years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate, with level principal repayments. FPEPB will bear the foreign exchange
risk and commitment charges.
2.        Background.  The project is located in Fujian Province, which has
experienced high growth in industrial output and energy consumption since the
development of special economic zones open to foreign investments including
Xiamen. Power outages were endemic until 1989/90, when s4swvral large power
plants were commissioned, and a temporary slowdown in economic growth allowed
supply to catch up with demand. But demand regained strength in 1991 and
remains under tight control. GOC has put a high priority on power development
and its strategy is to: (a) accelerate the harnessing of hydropower; (b)
increase coal-fired generation at minemouths, ports and load centers; (c)
replace obsolete plants with larger, more efficient and less polluting units;
and (d) strengthen power grid integration. Sector efficiency is also being
enhanced through industrial energy conservation, power pricing improvements
and adoption of modern methods in project design, system planning, environmen-
tal impact mitigation and utility management.
3.        Lessons Learned.  Lessons learned from the previous power projects
in China have been taken into account in preparing the proposed project. In
particular the early problems encountered in implementation of the first phase
project have been overcome by strengthening project management; increasing
consultant support in critical areas; clearly defining authority and responsi-
bility of owner, engineer and contractor; ensuring adequacy of resettlement
budgets; strengthening environmental management and providing for an indepen-
dent evaluation of resettlement.
4.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's involvement in the
Shuikou Hydroelectric Scheme dates from its inception in 1987. In view of the
long gestation period of the project, the Bank approved a loan (Loan 2775-CHA)
covering the initial implementation period and agreed to consider a second
loan covering the later years of implementation. The first loan has served to
support the introduction of modern planning, procurement and construction
methods, and the enhancement of environmental and resettlement policies.
Achievements to date include: relocation of the railway and other infrastruc-
ture; completion of excavation and placing about 75 percent of dam concrete;
commencement of powerhouse equipment erection; and resettlement of about
57,000 people. Construction is currently on schedule.. Studies dealing with
optimal mixed system operation, power system planning, and automated control
of the power grid, have also been largely completed.



-2-
5.        Prolect Objectives.  The proposed second 1    would help finance the
completion of the ongoing Shuikou Hydroelectric Schenm thus furthering the
objectives of the first phase. In addition the project. would promotes (a)
modern power system technology by financing an automated grid control system;
(b) power price reform through an action plan covering both retail and bulk
power tariff arrangements; (c) management training to assiut the power bureau
to cope with increasing demands placed on it by decentralization; and (d)
optimal system expansion through a study to explore possibilities of hydro-
based seasonal energy storage.
6.        Proiect DescriDtion.  The proposed project would first provide for
the completion of the Shuikou Hydroelectric Scheme, all components of which
were partly or fully covered under the first loan. These are: (a) construc-
tion of a concrete gravity dam (101 m high) with associated spillway, power-
house and navigation lock; (b) provision and installation of seven 200 1W
generating sets; (c) environmental management and resettlement of some 67,000
people; and (d) consultancy services for design, procurement and construction
management. In addition, the second project would include: (a) increased
capacity of navigation f cilities by constructing a shiplift in addition to
the originally proposed shiplock; (b) an automated control (SCADA) system for
the Fujian grid; (c) implementation of an action plan for tariff reform; (d)
provision of technical assistance and training i-n planning, commercial and
financial management, and project-related technology and management; and (e) a
study to explore hydro-based seasonal energy storage options in Pujian Prov-
ince and completion of studies on system planning and operation. Due to high
demand growth in the Fujian grid, its connection to the East China grid by a
560 km 500 kV transmission line to Hangzhou, originally included in the first
project has been indefinitely postponed.
7.        Proiect Imglementation.  The proposed project would be carried out
by FPEPB. The FPEPB has entrusted design of the project to East China Inves-
tigation and Design Institute (ECIDI). Supervision is being carried out by
Shuikou Hydroelectric Power Corporation (SHPC), an organization set up to
implement Shuikou and future hydro projects in Fujian Province. Both organi-
zations are being assisted by an international engineering firm. After ini-
tial teething problems, ECIDI and SHPC are now efficiently carrying out design
and supervision functions.
8.        The project cost is estimated at US$245.3 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$100 million equivalent. The project is ex-
empt from duties and taxes. The total financing required, including
interest during construction, is US$321 million, of which the Bank would
finance US$100 million equivalent (31 percent of the total). Retroactive
financing, in aggregate amount of US$5 million, would be provided under the
loan for expenditures which may be incurred before signing of the loan but
after December 31, 1991. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A.
9.        The major contracts, that would be financed under the project, are
ongoing having been commenced under the first loan. The contracts for civil
works and generating units are both being carried out by Japanese Chinese
joint ventures. Other existing equipment contracts, and new equipment con-
tracts have been, or are expected to be, awarded to foreign firms. Schedule B
shows procurement arrangements and the estimated disbursement schedule. A
timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in



-3-
China are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached.
The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 10610-CHA dated August 10, 1992, is being dis-
tributed separately.
10.       Sustainability.  The average rate level of FPEPB has increased from
8.8 fen/kWh in 1987 to 15.2 fen/kWh in 1990, and based on preliminary acc-
ounts, 16.S fen/kWh for 1991. The 88 percent increase between 1987 and 1991
is equivalent to 27 percent in real terms, and the average electricity price
in Fujian is now one of the highest In China. Financial projections indicate
the need for an increase of a further 16 percent in real terms between 1991
and 1994, to provide the covenanted debt service coverage.  This increase will
be achieved in conjunction with the implementation of a tariff action plan,
the major objective of which is improvement of tariff structure, especially
the unifying of "old" and "new" power prices for industrial users.
11.       Aareed Actions.  GOC agreed that it would:  (i) onlend the proceeds
of the proposed Bank loan to FPEPB on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank; (ii) continue to carry out a resettlement program satisfactory to the
Bank; (iii) monitor the reports of the Independent Evaluation of Resettlement
(IER), take action to accelerate the reestablishment of income in problem ar-
eas, and make funds available to sustain incomes at acceptable levels until
they are fully restored; and (iv) undertake an environmental management plan
satisfactory to the Bank.
12.       FPEPB agreed that it would:  (i) continue to furnish to the Bank by
April 30 of each year, a rolling long-term financial plan containing projected
income statements, sources and uses of funds and balance sheets, for a period
of no less than eight years; (ii) implement a plan for power tariff structure
improvements acceptable to the Bank in a manner satisfactory to the Bank,
including the completion of the first phase by December 31, 1993; (iii) carry
out its transmission expansion program in accordance with a schedule satisfac-
tory to the Bank; (iv) carry out a hydro project inventory reevaluation, with
specialist assistance and terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank; (v)
prepare, prior to completion of the dam, a program of annual maintenance of
the project works, satisfactory to the Bank, undertake periodic inspections of
the dam and associated works using independent experts whose qualifications
and experience are acceptable to the Bank, and implement their recommendation-
s; (vi) take all measures, including but not limited to tariff adjustments, to
ensure that its internal cash generation is sufficient to maintain a self-
financing ratio of nm less than 22 percent in 1992/93, 25 percent during
1994/95, and 30 percent thereafter; (vii) not incur additional debt unless a
reasonable forecast shows its internal cash generation would provide a debt
service coverage ratio of no less than 1.3 times, before 1995, and 1.5 times
thereafter; and (viii) maintain a debt/equity ratio of no more than 75/25 in
1992-96 and 70/30 thereafter.
13.       Environmental Aspects.  There are no major negative environmental
impacts. Negative effects on water quality usually associated with large
reservoirs, such as eutrophication, anoxic and low temperature discharges, and
sediment and nutrient trapping, are not expected to be significant at Shuikou,
since the reservoir volume is small in relation to river flow, and a high rate
of flushing exists. Positive impacts occur in relation to avoidance of ther-
mal generation, fisheries and navigation. An Environmental Management Plan
(EMP) acceptable to the Bank, aimed at enhancing favorable impacts and miti-
gating unfavorable impacts is being implemented.



-4-
14.       The resettlement planning and implementation to date is satisfactory
and in accordance with Bank policy guidelines. A contract for Independent
Eval-iation of Resettlement (IER) has been signed, which will monitor welfare,
and identify problem areas during the transition period until new production
systems reach full capacity.
15.       Benefitg and Risks.  The proposed project will provide reliable and
economical electricity supply to Fujian Province, without major adverse envi-
ronmental impacts. It will help Fujian to cope with rapidly growing indus-
trial demand resulting from the province opening to the outside world and will
contribute to a further improvement in the living standards of the population.
The project is part of the least-cost investment program for the Fujian grid,
which has an IERR of 11.4 percent based on the average tariff required to meet
financial covenants, and 19 percent, valuing incremental consumption using, as
"willingness to pay," the price paid for new consumption under the multi-tier
tariff currently applied in Fujian. Indirect benefits arise from:
(a) an improvement in navigational conditions in the Min River botween
Nanping and Fuzhou increasing transportation capacity from 250,000
tons/year to about 5.0 million tons/year;
(b) upgrading of infrastructure and housing as part of the resettlement
program, cand associated benefits to others in the region from the
expenditure in the region of some $300 million (overall scheme); and
(c) the avoidance of thermal generation, and the associated environmen-
tal impacts of burning bf 1.6 million tons of standard coal/year.
16.       The risks generally associated with hydroelectric projects, related
to potential cost and sphedule overruns, are very low for the current proj-
ect, in which foundations and river bed work are complete, only one flood
season remains prior to dam completion, and the first generating unit is on
schedule for commissioning in June 1993. Similarly, the risk of poorly han-
dled resettlement has largely receded with successful implementation to date.
The risk remains that some people affected by the resettlement program will be
disadvantaged during the period taken to brinj new production systems up to
full capacity. This risk is being minimized by the ZER, and assurances being
obtained from the Government that it will act on the results of the IER to
supplement incomes as necessary during the transition period.
17.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the executive
directors approve the proposed loan.
