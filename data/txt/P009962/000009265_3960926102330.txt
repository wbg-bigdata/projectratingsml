MEMOdANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AND OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN/CREDIT TO INDIA
FOR A SECOND NATIONAL DAIRY PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan of US$200
million equivalent and development credit of SDR 121.2 million (US$160 million
equivalent) to India is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be for 20
years, including a five year grace period, at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity.
The loan/credit would help finance a second national dairy project.
2.      Background.  Livestock accounts for some 18% of the value of India's
agricultural output, two-thirds of the livestock output is from dairying. India
has the largest cattle and buffalo populations in the world and is the world's
third largest milk producer. Dairying is widespread covering all regions and with
nearly half of India's rural households owning milch animals, generally with 1 to 3
animals per household. About 20% or milch animal owning households are landless
and a further 30% are marginal farmers with less than 2.5 acres of land. Dairying
is practiced by all social classes and is of particular benefit to women who fre-
quently handle the bulk of a household's dairy activities. Dairying is a closely
integrated activity with crop production, utilizing available crop residues and
by-products and frequently underutilized family labor. Consequently, India has a
comparative advantage in dairying.
3.      Both milk production and consumption grew by about 4% per annum over the
past decade with consumption growth in urban areas over 6% per annum.  While mil&
import levels have stabilized in the past decade, to average 0.75% of production,
the projected continued rapid growth in demand, especially in urban areas, places
particular need on efficient mechanisms for collecting, processing and marketing of
fresh milk from surplus rural areas to the cities. Additionally, while animal
productivity is increasing, yields remain low and substantial gains are possible
from improving nutrition, animal husbandry and technical support services.
4.      A major dairy development program, "Operation Flood" (OF), was launched in
1970. This was based on the highly successful milk producers cooperative estab-
lished in 1946 at Anand in Gujarat. Under OF, two government agencies, the
National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) and the Indian Dairy Corporation (GDC) were
established to provide technical assistance and investment funding for estab-
lishment and development of other milk producer cooperatives. As part of the
targeted improvements in implementation of OF, thlese bodies were merged in October
1987 with incorporation of IDC's functions, assets, liabilities and privileges
within a new restructured NDDB. OF now covers all of India's states and union
territories involving some 4.7 million households and 47,000 village societies in
170 cooperative unions. OF cooperatives market some 8 million liters per day
(mlpd) of milk in about 140 cities. The cooperatives collect, process and market
milk, and provide animal productivity enhancement services to member households.
Bank support to OF began with three state level dairy projects in the early 1970s
followed in 1978 by a national dairy project and involving total credits of US$224
million. All four projects have been completed and project experience has been
generally good, especially under the national project where OF imilk procurement
grew from 1.7 mlpd in 1978 to 8 mlpd by project completion in 1986. Nevertheless,
the rapid expansion in the past five years has resulted in many new and still
financially and institutionally fragile cooperative institutions. There is also a
need for a number of adjustments in development emphasis and management at the



-2-
Level of both NDDE and the cooperatives. Particularly urgent is the need to reduce
involvement of local governments in cooperative management and create financially
strong, independent and business oriented cooperative entities.
5.      Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The project supports an important rural
activity with highly positive impact on key sector objectives: increasing employ-
ment and incomes in the rural sector, including very favorable distributional
impact as concerns participation of the poor, women and deprived social groups;
helping meet rapidly growing domestic demand, especially in urban areas with
associated improvements in nutrition and long-term potential benefits on the
balance of payments; promoting modernization and improvements in efficiency and
competitivity of the dairy industry; and reducing government involvement and
promoting private sector management principles for cooperatives. OF is at a criti-
cal development stage requiring policy and institutional changes and technological
advances to increase productivity in order to ensure its long-term sustainability
and continued development. The Bank's support and financial leverage would assist
GOI and NDDB to implement investments and adjustments for the long-term development
of the industry.
6.      Project Objectives.  Key objectives under the project would be to promote
institutional and policy reforms allowing dairy cooperatives to operate as
autonomous business entities, improving financial viability through tightening
subproject appraisal procedures, strengthening cooperative and NDDB management
capabilities, further developing OF's animal productivity programs, and expanding
milk procurement, processing and marketing. Emphasis would be placed on consolida-
tion of OF's past achievements with expansion primarily of existing cooperatives
rather than creation of new institutions.
7.      Project Description.  The proposed project would finance the third phase of
OF involving: (a) expansion of existing cooperative unions (increased numbers of
farmers, village societies and milk procurement per cooperative union) and estab-
lishment of a limited number of new cooperative unions; (b) further development of
animal productivity enhancement services (veterinary services, animal husbandry
extension, production and sale of balanced cattle feed, promotion of fodder
production, genetic improvement and foot and mouth disease control); (c) expansion
of the cooperatives' dairy processing and marketing infrastructure; and, (d)
institution strengthening of NDDB and the cooperatives through training, research
and development, improved market promotion, strengthened accounting, management
information systems, monitoring and evaluation and financial and business manage-
ment skills, and strengthening capabilities and procedures for development
planning, subproject investment assessment and supervision. The project would be
carried out over 7 years and the loan/credit would provide funds for civil works,
machinery, equipment, vehicles, training and consultant services. The total cost
of the project is estimated at US$677.7 million and includes an estimated US$255
million of expenditures under international competitive bidding. The project
includes a US$36 million provision for retroactive financing of project associated
expenditures, as well as establishment of a US$30 million equivalent Special
Account (SDR 22.7 million) to facilitate timely disbursements during project
implementation. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project process-
ing events and the status of Bank Group operations in India are given in Schedules
C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 6897-IN dated November 18, 1987, is also attached.



-3-
8.      Agreed Actions.  The Government and NDDB have agreed on the following
actions: (a) application by NDDB during review of cooperative development
proposals of a set of onlending conditions related to past performance and a sAtis-
factory short and medium-term action plan for implementing or completing the
implementation of policy and institutional reforms designed to ach'cve autonomy and
self reliance for the cooperative concerned. (These reforms relate to: adoption
of model cooperative bylaws; elected boards; autonomy to the cooperative in
pricing, marketing, the appointment of professional managers and employment of
labor; ownership and management by the cooperative of dairies and other
infrastructure; and proper internal control procedures, accounting and auditing);
(b) adjustments in NDDB's planning, investment analysis and approval criteria for
subprojects to ensure the financial viability of cooperative investments; (c)
upward adjustment of the interest rate charged to cooperatives (to 101) so as to
conform with other comparable rural sector lending rates, as well as a reduced
moratorium period and loan repayment period; (d) measures to reduce the levels of
investment grants provided to the sector and to directly charge more cooperative
services to beneficiaries; (e) alignment of commodity aid pricing with domestic
prices to eliminate subsidies; (f) expansion in scopz of NDDB's review process for
monitoring of India's dairy commodity aid/trade arrangements; and, (g) assurances
relative to general and financial management and the division of functional respon-
sibilities under the recently restructured NDDB.
9.      Benefits.  By project completion participating rural households are
expected to increase by 2 million to some 6.7 million (about 3? million people)
with sale revenues of some US$1.1 billion per year, at least half of which would be
to landless rural families or marginal farmers including substantial benefits to
women. OF supply of milk and milk products to urban areas would increase by 5.2
mlpd or by 60X. Quantified project benefits include the incremental net value
added resulting from transfer of surplus milk from rural to urban areas and the
project'sa impact on animal productivity. The internal economic rate of return is
271.
10.      Risks.  Technically, the OF program is well proven and NDDB is a strong
implementing agency highly committed to the project's objectives. The main risk
relates to the project's institutional and policy reform objectives for the
cooperatives, considered essential for their financial viability and long term
sustainability as independent business entities responsive to producer needs. The
extent of the reforms still required for most cooperatives will need substantial
adjustments at the level of state governments and continued firm commitment by GOI
and NDDB. To allow for delays that might arise as a result of firm application of
NDDB's onlending conditions related to these reforms, project implementation has
been scheduled over seven years rather than the five years initially targeted based
on past physical achievements.  Nevertheless, the commitments for enacting the
targeted reforms which were agreed between NDDB and the state governments prior to
negotiations, indicate that significant progress can be expected.
11.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and Association respectively and
recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan and credit.
