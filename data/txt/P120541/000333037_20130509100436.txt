Program Development       The proposed program aims to strengthen the schools sector’s
Objective and             institutional arrangements in the short term, in ways that in the
Contribution to Country   medium term will: (i) increase access to school education, especially
Partnership Strategy      for rural girls and boys at the lower secondary level; (ii) improve the
                          quality of teaching and learning in primary and lower secondary
                          education; and (iii) enhance efficiency in decentralized governance of
                          the schools sector.

                          The proposed program would contribute to the Country Partnership
                          Strategy’s second pillar – improving the quality of service delivery to
                          citizens – by improving equity, access and quality of education
                          service delivery.

Risks and Risk            •   Implementation of key and sensitive reforms may not be continued
Mitigation                    under the PAMT 2013-2016. The Bank team will continue to
                              engage the Government in a close dialogue on these reforms, and
                              to support decision making through technical assistance when
                              important technical issues arise.
                          •   The reform program faces resistance from unions, including
                              teacher resistance to the efficiency measures and the move
                              toward greater accountability. The Government will continue to
                              engage in a broad dialogue with teacher unions and teachers, with
                              a view to creating a buy-in to the reform program through
                              participation and decision-making.
                          •   Attainment of the ambitious objectives of the Government’s
                              program may be constrained unless sufficient resources are made
                              available. Education has been a national priority for successive
                              government and this level of political commitment is expected to
                              continue.
                          •   Implementation of the governmental program may be constrained
                              by the capacity of decentralized agencies. The MEN is making
                              considerable efforts to strengthen the capacity of its management
                              systems.

       INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
                  PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A PROPOSED
             SECOND EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                     TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO

I.         INTRODUCTION

1.      The wave of democratization that the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region
has experienced since the start of the Arab Spring has also reached Morocco, although its
experience has been a reasonably peaceful one with social demonstrations taking place
regularly across the country during 2011 and only sporadic outbursts of violence noted. This
social movement started with calls for political change, a curbing of corruption and a more
inclusive development process. In March 2011, the King of Morocco proposed a broad and
comprehensive package of political reforms that were approved in a constitutional referendum
held on July 1, 2011.1 The new constitution sets the basis for a more open and democratic
society, provides mechanisms for the construction of a modern state of law and institutions,
and lays the foundation for extended regionalization. Transparent elections, held on
November 25, 2011, were won by the Parti de la justice et du développement (PJD), a party
that had traditionally been in active opposition and has seen its support increasing steadily in
recent years. The PJD won 27 percent of the vote, almost twice the score of the second
largest political party. An intense period of discussions among political parties then followed,
leading to the formation, in early January 2012, of a four-party coalition Government, with
the head of the PJD becoming the Head of Government.

2.     In this context, Morocco’s unique experience reflects its political distinctiveness in the
region, even though many of the same grievances among the population exist (lack of
economic opportunities, corruption, widespread poverty, social inequality, unemployment).
This experience has shown that Moroccans seem more inclined to seek evolution within the
system – gradual change continuous with the country’s history and religious values.
Morocco’s management of its own protest movement seemed well managed and the external
world highlighted Morocco’s particular situation. The PJD election showed that, even in a
constrained setting, the population was seeking real and sustainable change while working
within the system. The protests, which continue to this day, keep the pressure on the
Government to follow through on the promises and expectations expressed over the past year.
The King remains popular among the general public and is widely believed to act as the
guarantor of political stability and social cohesion.

3.      These changes have followed on the heels of other reforms already undertaken since
the current King came to power. Successive national governments have overseen an
impressive political, economic and social transformation, with a marked acceleration of
structural reforms in recent years. Sound macroeconomic management has produced solid
foundations, and the country was on a recovery path from the stagnation of the 1990s when a
series of adverse external shocks hit the economy, starting with the 2008 financial crisis.
However, as shown, none of these factors provided total immunity to the rising tide of
dissatisfaction and to the pressure from the outstanding development issues and challenges.
The transition has shown the powerful consequences of exclusion and high levels of youth
unemployment in the MENA region. Jobs are at the forefront of attention and unemployment

1
    The vote in favor of the proposed reforms was 98.5 percent with a participation rate of 73 percent.

                                                          1
is the main political and economic issue facing the Government. Despite a relatively
favorable socio-political situation compared to some other MENA countries, Morocco still
has a lot to do to address inequality and poverty, and its social indicators remain relatively
low in comparison with other countries in the region.

4.      The movements associated with the political transition and constitutional changes
represent real pressure on the Moroccan State for meaningful and quick change. While the
people seem to be willing to support the Government and its mandate, they are expecting and
indeed demanding that it break with the past and usher in more credible and faster reforms,
notably in the areas of job creation and improvement of the quality of public services
delivered. Morocco is thus on the threshold of potentially profound social, political and
economic transformation. If the Government can assume more ownership of the political
process and genuinely deliver, then this will go a long way to transforming the social and
political landscape of Morocco.

5.      Investing in human capital through quality education is a priority in Morocco’s current
development process. The low level of education and skills of the workforce is among the
main factors which constrain the country’s economic growth and long-term prosperity. The
labor market is imbalanced, with notable mismatches between job demands and graduation
qualifications and skills. Improving the quality of outcomes in the education and training
sector has become a key focus of governmental actions. To overcome the challenges faced by
the education sector, previous governments embarked on a comprehensive reform of the
education and training system, beginning with the 1999 National Education and Training
Charter (CNEF).2 The CNEF, which enjoyed strong national consensus, declared 2000-2009
the “education and training decade?, thereby establishing education and training as a national
priority. In line with royal instructions, an ambitious Education Emergency Program 2009-
2012 (PUEN)3 was drawn up to build on this decade-long reform process. The Government,
appointed just over a year ago, is now preparing its Education Action Plan 2013-2016
(PAMT), and is drawing lessons from the implementation of the previous action plans.

6.     The proposed operation closes out a cycle of two development policy loans (DPL) that
have supported the Government’s PUEN through the period 2009-2012. In 2007, the
Government of the day asked five major donors (European Union [EU], European Investment
Bank [EIB], French Development Agency [AFD], African Development Bank [AfDB] and
World Bank) to assist the implementation of the PUEN reform agenda through the
progressive application of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The World Bank
developed the two DPLs to support the refinement and implementation of the PUEN reform
agenda, in close collaboration with the other donors mentioned above.

7.      The Bank has had a long and active dialogue with the Government in the education
sector. A Basic Education Reform Support Project (PARSEM)–a sector-wide approach
operation–supported the implementation of program reforms during the second half of the
CNEF implementation period, closing in June 2009.

8.      Through 2008 and 2009, joint technical and preparation missions were carried out by
the five donors, known as the Technical and Financial Partners (TFP) Group. In the course of
these missions, the TFP Group engaged in an active and coordinated dialogue with the
Government on the new strategic framework. More specifically, the TFP Group and the
Government discussed the various actions proposed to remedy the structural problems that
were contributing to low education performance, especially at the basic and secondary
education levels. This ongoing dialogue led to the joint identification of priority reform areas
and the definition of main results/outcome indicators, along with monitoring and evaluation
arrangements. Through 2010, 2011 and 2012, six-monthly joint missions were carried out by
the TFP Group (which now also includes the Spanish International Cooperation Agency for
Development [AECID] and the Japanese International Cooperation Agency [JICA]) to
monitor progress in PUEN implementation.

II.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

II.A.   Recent economic developments

9.      Since 2008, Morocco has been hit by a series of exogenous shocks. Like other
emerging countries, Morocco has suffered from the 2008 global financial crisis, though the
limited financial integration of Morocco into global financial markets has contained the direct
contagion effects. More serious were the effects of the subsequent food and fuel crises. With
the price of Brent crude oil averaging more than US$110 per barrel in 2011-2012 and no
domestic oil production, Morocco has been confronted with a major deterioration of its terms
of trade. This deterioration was compounded by a significant increase in its food import bill in
2012 as a result of a severe domestic drought at a time of soaring international food prices,
especially of wheat. Finally, with a strong trade exposure to the EU, Morocco has been
adversely affected by developments in the euro area, in particular the sovereign debt crises in
Spain, Italy and other peripheral countries and subsequent slowing down of economic growth.

10.     These internal and external shocks combined with significant economic rigidities have
exposed the fragility of the Moroccan economy in 2012. Gross domestic product (GDP) is
estimated to have grown at a positive but modest 2.7 percent, compared to 3.4 percent
expected in the 2012 Budget Law. This lackluster performance reflected the continued
vulnerability of the agriculture sector (which declined by 9.8 percent) to erratic rainfalls. The
non-agricultural sector grew at a healthier rate of 4.6 percent; however mostly driven by debt-
creating domestic demand. Public consumption increased by 5 percent and household
consumption by 4.8 percent, the latter benefiting from wage rises and relatively low prices of
non-food products. Investment increased at the more moderate rate of 2.7 percent, mostly
driven by programs of social housing, public works, and industrial equipment.

11.     The Government and the Central Bank (BAM) continued to demonstrate their
commitment to control inflation. Notwithstanding higher world prices of imported
commodities, inflation has been kept low thanks to price subsidies benefiting basic food and
fuel products. As a result of the Government’s price controls, the average consumer price
index edged up to only 1.3 percent in 2012 as compared to 0.9 percent in 2011. Among all
sectors, food sector prices contributed the most to inflation in 2012 (up 2.2 percent). The
upward adjustment of the administered prices for fuel products in June 2012 and related direct
increase in transportation prices (by 3.2 percent) has had limited indirect effect on overall
inflation.
                                               3
12.     Morocco’s unemployment rate has been stubbornly high at around 9 percent—or
about one million people—despite years of respectable economic growth and declining
participation rates. Less than half of the Moroccan population is actually active (i.e., either
employed or looking for a job), which is one of the lowest participation rates among emerging
economies. Participation rates have been steadily declining from 55.3 percent in 1999 to 48.4
percent in 2012. Regarding the profile of the job seekers, four out of five unemployed are
urban jobless, two-thirds are youth aged 15-29, a quarter of jobless people hold a university
diploma, half of the unemployed are looking for their first jobs, and more than two-thirds
have been jobless for more than one year.

13.     The gradual pace of public finance reforms coupled with the economic turmoil in
Europe and continued high prices of commodities have eventually had their toll on Morocco’s
fiscal balance. Data released by the Moroccan authorities in early February 2013 indicate that
the worsening of public finance in 2012 had been more pronounced than expected.4
According to the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), the budget deficit widened to 7.6
percent of GDP, which compares to a deficit of 5.5 percent of GDP envisaged in the 2012
Budget Law.5 The deficit would have been even higher without the decision of the
Government to increase the prices of liquid fuel products in June 2012 (up 19.6 percent for
gasoline, 14 percent for gasoil, and 13.4 percent for industrial fuel), which helped reduce the
deficit by 0.6 percentage point of GDP.

14.     The current universal and open subsidy system and higher wage bill are increasingly
testing Morocco’s record of fiscal prudence. Despite the good performance of tax collection
in 2012 (up 6.1 percent), government revenues could not compensate for the increase in
current expenditures (up 11 percent), mostly due to higher subsidies and a larger public wage
bill. The combined cost of the subsidy system and the Government wage bill (at 6.6 percent
of GDP and 11.5 percent of GDP, respectively) represented more than 53.0 percent of total
expenditures in 2012. Their increases contributed to more than 63.5 percent of the total
increase in current expenditures in 2012.

15.     Even though the fiscal deficit has been mostly financed on the domestic market, there
have been no apparent signs of private sector crowding out—thanks to the relaxation of
monetary policy by the BAM (see below). The Treasury issued the equivalent of 6 percent of
GDP in domestic bonds and sold part of its capital in the Banque populaire for an additional
0.4 percent of GDP. To fill the financing gap, the Government raised US$1.5 billion bonds on
international financial markets in December 2012. As a result, the Treasury debt increased by
5.1 percentage points of GDP in 2012 to reach 58.8 percent of GDP. While the Treasury is

  The budget deficit does not take into account privatization receipts.

mostly indebted in its own currency (with only a debt of about 14 percent of GDP
denominated in foreign exchange), the level and pace of deterioration of the debt are
worrisome. In just four years, Morocco’s Treasury debt increased by 11.5 percentage points
of GDP. Clearly, without corrective measures, Morocco’s current fiscal stance risks
impacting the sustainability of Morocco’s overall macroeconomic framework in the medium
term.

16.     The weakening fiscal situation has also put the balance of payments under stress. The
trade deficit continued to deteriorate in 2012 due to sluggish external demand, notably from
Europe, and increased value of imports due to strong domestic demand and higher world
prices of imported commodities. Total nominal imports increased by 6.7 percent, while
exports grew by 4.7 percent. Tourism receipts declined by 1.5 percent and workers’
remittances dropped by 3.9 percent. The current account deficit is therefore estimated to have
widened to 9.6 percent of GDP in 2012.6 On the capital account side, net foreign direct
investment (FDI) inflows grew by a healthy 17.6 percent during the period, thanks to foreign
investors’ continued confidence in the Moroccan economy. However, total net external
capital flows were not sufficient to finance the current account deficit, and net official
international reserves declined by US$3.1 billion to reach the critical level of US$16.3 billion
by end 2012, corresponding to 3.9 months of imports coverage.

17.     To stimulate economic activity and help finance the economy—in a context of price
controls and low inflation expectations—the BAM decided to reduce its policy rate from 3.25
percent to 3 percent in March 2012 and to lower the money reserve requirement for banks
from 6 to 4 percent in September 2012. These decisions, together with higher weekly
liquidity injections by the BAM into the domestic banking system, had the effect of relaxing
the liquidity constraints in the money market and helped finance the economy. As a result,
money supply increased by 5.2 percent by end 2012 after an increase of 6.5 percent in 2011.
Credit to the economy increased by 5.7 percent (compared to 10.3 percent in 2011), mostly
driven by credit to corporate treasuries (up 7.8 percent). The latter was in part the result of
liquidity needs of businesses to compensate for large arrears overdue by the public sector.
Credit to housing also increased substantially (up 6.1 percent) with the extension of the social
housing programs backed by the Government. With increased access to credit and the
relatively low prices of housing equipment, consumption credit jumped by 9.8 percent in
2012. At the same time, credit to business equipment dropped by 2 percent. Non-performing
loans remained at an average 4.3 percent of total credit to the private sector, slightly declining
over the fourth quarter of 2012.

II.B.      Macroeconomic outlook and debt sustainability

18.     Morocco’s macroeconomic room for maneuvering has narrowed considerably. The
twin deficits that have accumulated to finance the series of adverse external shocks since 2008
have largely exhausted the room for maneuver that Morocco had built prior to these crises
through prudent macroeconomic policies and management. They unveiled two main
weaknesses that are endangering Morocco’s external and fiscal sustainability in case of a
further deterioration of its external or domestic environment. First, the slow structural
transformation of the economy hinders the prospects of a rapid increase in competitiveness,
exports, and quality job generation. Second is the pursuit of highly onerous fiscal policies,

                                               5
  such as the universal subsidy system and tax exoneration programs. These two weaknesses
  are contributing to the reversal of the downward trend of public debt and the depletion of
  foreign reserves to critical levels.

  19.     Macroeconomic prospects in the medium term will greatly depend on the scope, depth
  and pace of Morocco’s reform programs as well as developments in Europe – the main
  trading partner of Morocco. Morocco is expected to benefit from ongoing reforms to improve
  the economy’s overall competitiveness and the effectiveness of sectoral policies. The current
  reforms to strengthen governance and justice, consolidate public finance, and deepen
  decentralization are critical to achieving long-lasting improvement in economic efficiency,
  productivity, and employment. Under these assumptions, economic growth should recover to
  around 5 percent by 2015. Inflation is projected to remain under control at 2.5 percent or
  below. Main macroeconomic indicators are presented in Table 2 below.

  would have to be adjusted downward. A potential deterioration of the world economy,

particularly in Europe, would negatively impact the medium-term macroeconomic outlook
through reduced prospects on exports, including tourism, as well as on workers’ remittances
and FDI flows. Similarly, sustained high commodity prices, a deterioration of the regional
context and prolonged global financial uncertainties would have an adverse impact on
Morocco’s prospects. Moreover, there is a potential risk that even pre-crisis growth levels
might not be sustainable over the medium term if internal demand remains the key driver of
growth.

21.     In line with the new constitutional requirement, the Government has further
committed to fiscal stability and to progressively decrease the budget deficit to the medium-
term target of about 3 percent of GDP by 2016 through the implementation of a set of critical
reforms. The key measures include: (i) reforming the universal subsidy system; (ii)
implementing civil service reform, notably by introducing a ceiling on wage expenditures and
a new remuneration system; (iii) accelerating the fiscal and pension reform agenda; and (iv)
enhancing the efficiency of public as well as private investments.

22.      The Government’s debt strategy is to diversify financing sources and take on a greater
proportion of external financing (Table 3). In this context, new external financing schemes are
being put in place beyond the classical multilateral and bilateral sources of financing. The
government signed in February 2013 a grant agreement of US$1.25 billion over a five year
period with the Kuwait Development Fund to support economic and social projects. In
addition, the government signed in March 2013 a first installment of US$400 million grant of
a total of US$ 1.25 billion committed by the Saudi Development Fund. Both grants are part of
a broader cooperation agreement signed with the Gulf Cooperation Council countries last year
committing US$5 billion over a five-year period. In August 2012, Morocco also benefited
from a Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) of US$6.2 billion approved by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF). The PLL is part of the proactive approach of the
Government to ensure new precautionary lines of credit to be able to cope in the event of a
severe deterioration of external balances that could erupt for instance as a result of a
worsening of the economic situation in Europe.

23.     Despite its deterioration in 2012, the external position is expected to remain
sustainable over the medium term provided that key critical reforms under implementation
take hold. As noted earlier, the current account deficit deteriorated in 2012 and is expected to
progressively edge downward to around 5.2 percent of GDP in 2017 benefiting from
improved export potentials and a recovery of tourism activities and workers’ remittances.
This scenario critically assumes that Morocco would benefit from its continued reform efforts
                                              7
in trade and competitiveness, supported among others by the World Bank. These reforms,
along with sector strategies already under implementation, would translate into higher
productive private investments, including FDIs, and progressive gains in competitiveness of
its exports, including tourism. In this context, external debt is expected to follow an inverted
U-path reaching a maximum at almost 40 percent of GDP in 2015 before steadily dropping
thereafter, while net foreign reserves will remain at around four months of imports.

24.     Balance of payments financing requirements constitute a moderate concern in the
medium term, given the country’s relatively low outstanding external debt, the financial
support from the Gulf States, and still adequate foreign reserves. As the current account
deficits are projected to steadily improve in the medium term, financing large share of them
through traditional multilateral and bilateral credit lines along with other private capital flows,
including FDIs, should not be a major constraint. In addition, the Gulf Cooperation Council
countries recently confirmed their intention to invest US$5 billion over the next five years,
mostly in the form of grant. Any remaining financing gap could be filled by tapping
international financial markets. The PLL from the IMF will continue to provide a potential
precautionary line of credit over the period 2013-2014.

25.     The authorities are considering a possible move to a more formal inflation targeting
system in conjunction with a more flexible exchange rate. The BAM has developed the
necessary prerequisites and tools to shift to an inflation targeting framework. However, the
timing of this reform should be carefully considered as it requires measures to ensure fiscal
sustainability, especially with regards to reforming the subsidy system so as to prevent a
negative impact on financial stability. The current exchange rate regime has contributed to
macroeconomic stability, yet given the rigidities of the economy, the recent trends in the
current account balance would suggest that it could possibly be undermining international
competitiveness. In the future, a more flexible exchange rate policy would help strengthen
structural reforms to foster competitiveness and weather external shocks.

26.     A comprehensive public debt sustainability analysis indicates that the fiscal
framework remains sustainable although it would weaken under some medium term downside
risks (see Annex 5.1). Indeed, when the debt sustainability analysis was run under the
assumption of “no-policy-change? scenario, the debt stock increased steadily over the period
2013-2018. All the six bound tests proved sustainable over the medium term, although debt of
three of the tests remained high within the range of 58-60 percent of GDP, which indicates
that debt sustainability remains fragile to further deterioration in Morocco’s internal or
external business environment.

27.     In sum, Morocco is facing growing economic and fiscal challenges. Assuming that the
ongoing key fiscal and structural reforms, including those envisaged in the 2013 Budget Law
and described above, are implemented in a timely fashion, Morocco’s macroeconomic
framework would remain adequate and sustainable in the medium term. The projected
macroeconomic outlook and the success of the structural reforms depend on a robust fiscal
consolidation, a prudent monetary policy, and more flexible exchange rate policy over the
medium term that supports external competitiveness. In particular, it is of utmost urgency that
the government starts implementing the reform of the subsidy system to ensure the
sustainability and efficiency of public finance. Until now, the adverse effects of the global
environment on Morocco have been weathered relatively well, thanks to strong economic
fundamentals and sound macroeconomic policies carried out over the last decade. Yet, in
                                                8
contrast to when the international crisis struck in 2008, the Government today has much
smaller margins for maneuver. Its commitment to deepen and expand the current reform
efforts is key to the prospects for a sustainable recovery of investment, growth, and
employment in the years to come.

III.      THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

III.A. Education sector background and key issues

III.A.1 Access to, and completion of, schooling

28.    Implementation of the CNEF and the PUEN resulted in impressive progress in terms
of access to education. Efforts to increase the availability of educational services have led to
expanded participation in education at all levels. From 1990/91 to 2012/13, national net
enrollment rates increased from 52.4 percent to 98.2 percent for primary education, from 17.5
percent to 56.7 percent in lower secondary education and from 6.1 percent to 32.4 percent in
upper secondary education.7 The increased enrollment in compulsory education has placed
pressure on higher levels of education, leading to substantial increases in student enrollments
in upper secondary schools, universities and other tertiary education institutions.

29.     Progress has been made in ensuring equitable access to education for young children.
While the gap between urban boys and rural girls at the primary education level narrowed to
just 3.5 percentage points by 2012/13, the gap at higher levels of the education system
remains large, with 53 percentage points still separating urban boys and rural girls at the
lower secondary education level in 2012/13 (Figure 1).

30.     Education completion rates have improved, but, at the current pace, the Millennium
Development Goal (MDG) universal primary school completion target is unlikely to be
achieved by 2015. The primary school completion rate (Grades 1-6) has increased from 68.6
percent in 2005/06 to 90.0 percent in 2012/13. More than two-thirds of students complete the
full two cycles of basic education (Grades 1-9). At both levels, girls’ and boys’ completion
rates are now almost identical (Table 4).

III.A.2. Schooling outcomes

31.        To its credit, Morocco has been able to maintain a constant, albeit low, level of
education quality all the while increasing school education coverage (at a particularly rapid
rate in primary education). Figure 2 shows the percentages of students from Morocco and
other MENA countries attaining each international benchmark for Grade 4 mathematics
across the last three editions (2003, 2007 and 2011) of the international Trends in
Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), compared with two better-performing countries
(Hungary and Turkey) and the international median. The 2011 editions of TIMSS and the
Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) showed low learning achievement
scores for Moroccan Grade 4 and Grade 8 students compared to those from other participating
countries. With the exception of Dubai UAE (for the Grade 8 tests in mathematics and
science), no Arab state achieved above the international medians; among the participating
Arab states, Morocco and Yemen produced the weakest scores. In Grade 4 mathematics, for
example, 74 percent of Moroccan students did not reach even the lowest of four benchmark
levels,8 while none at all reached the highest benchmark level; this compares with the
international median of 10 percent not reaching even the lowest benchmark and 4 percent
reaching the highest benchmark. In Grade 4 reading, 79 percent of Moroccan students did not
reach the lowest benchmark, and once again none reached the highest benchmark; the
international median scores 8 percent and 5 percent for these two benchmark levels
respectively.

 In response to the following TIMSS Grade 4 mathematics question involving the addition of two three-place
whole numbers based on the reading of situation text – “There are 218 passengers and 191 crew members on a
ship. How many people are on the ship altogether?? – only 35% of Moroccan students answered correctly.

32.         Learning achievement is uneven within the country. The first National Learning
Assessment Program (PNEA), carried out jointly in 2008 by the CSE and the Ministry of
Education (MEN), points to small gender gaps in mathematics and science, but large gender
gaps in favor of girls in Arabic and French (Table 5). In addition, there are considerable
differences between urban and rural areas and between public and private schools (even when
the comparison is between urban public and private settings). Unfortunately, the second
PNEA, originally scheduled for 2011, has been postponed until 2013 as a result of ongoing
teacher strikes.

33.     The legacy of poor access to education weighs on the adult population’s education
capital. In the past, few Moroccan males and even fewer females had access to schooling,
with only a small proportion reaching secondary and higher education. Literacy rates have as
a result long been low. The effects of the recent increase in school enrollments, however, can
be seen in the positive trends in literacy over the past 25 years, with both overall rates
increasing and (in the case of young adults who have graduated more recently from the formal
school system) the gender gaps narrowing.

III.A.3. School sector financing

34.          The leveling-off in primary student enrollment10 that has followed a demographic
decline in the relevant school-age population,11 along with the ongoing shift from public to
private provision,12 provides favorable conditions for a reallocation of resources to support
expansion of other levels of the education system; at present, secondary education (lower
secondary and upper secondary combined) absorbs more than half of the education sector
budget. That said, there is room for achieving greater efficiencies in the school education
system, particularly at the secondary level; at the broadest level, public spending, as a
proportion of both the overall national budget and GDP, is high by international standards
whereas results are average (primary enrollment rates) to below-average (repetition rates,
gender equity in secondary education, scores in international learning assessment surveys).
Teacher remuneration, as measured against per capita GDP, is at the high end of the
international middle-income country range at the primary level and very high at the secondary
level; this results in high per-student costs relative to comparable countries. Whereas student-
teacher ratios (although high by MENA standards) are now in line with international norms, a
large proportion of teachers at the secondary level still do not teach the minimum number of
weekly hours (see Table 6).13

III.A.4. School sector governance

35.        Decentralization of the governance of the education sector is under way, even
though effectiveness of these reforms remains a key challenge. The capacity of the Regional
Education Offices (AREF), which have been granted some administrative and financial
autonomy, has improved over time. The AREFs have played an important role in leading the
reform program at the regional and sub-regional levels.

36.         There exists also an independent evaluation institution under the Higher Council
for Education (CSE) to evaluate system performance and disseminate its findings and results.
The publication of its first report in April 2008 led to a welcome debate among the various
stakeholders on increasing outcome measurements and accelerating the improvement of the
education and training sectors. This new institution is expected to help the system manage for
results and ensure greater accountability.

37.        With increasing public awareness on quality of life, the environmental protection
and sustainable development agenda has become a national priority. An Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) system consistent with international good practices is now fully
operational, at the national and regional levels, and contributes to the mainstreaming of social
and environmental dimensions in development activities. The Government has successfully
developed the necessary EIA operational tools and manuals14 for the preparation and review
of the EIA system including the appropriate procedures for public consultation as well as an
annual reporting of its activities and achievements.15

38.       The MEN applies an “Environmental and Social Protection Framework?16 to its
school construction program. The Framework aims to prevent, attenuate or compensate for a
range of negative impacts that may arise from school construction, and ensure that: (i) the
safety and security of buildings’ users are guaranteed; (ii) energy use is as efficient as

possible; (iii) buildings are accessible to disabled users; (iv) sites are managed in ways that
respect users’ and neighbors’ health and well-being (e.g., efficient water use, waste
management, management of dangerous goods, proper use of safety equipment); and (v) all
land acquired is suitable for school construction.

39.     Accumulation of arrears in compensations for resettlement with respect to land
acquisitions has been a generic issue in Morocco. Some structural weaknesses in the practices
related to land acquisition in the schools sector were noted in the assessments carried out in
2009 by the World Bank and the AFD and recommendations were made with a view to clear
compensation claim arrears and reduce the time taking to deal with new compensation claims.
Since 2009, the MEN and the MEF have put in place mechanisms to better monitor land
acquisition and related compensation payments, and the MEF has settled a significant number
of compensation cases, over a period when, moreover, the volume of new acquisitions
through expropriation – whether measured in terms of land area or land value – has decreased
dramatically. The time now taken to deal with new claims is on average three months.

III.A.5. Transition from school to work

40.        Morocco’s unemployment rate has fallen during the last years, thanks mainly to
the good economic growth that was brought about by the expansion of the service, commerce
and public works sectors and lower labor force growth. The unemployment rate was reduced
from 13 percent in 2000 to 8.9 percent in 2011. The difference between female and male
unemployment has also significantly diminished (9.6 percent for women, 8.9 percent for men,
in 2009). Unemployment rates are higher in urban areas (13.7 percent) than in rural areas (3.9
percent), for young people (17.6 percent for those aged 15-24), especially those living in
urban areas (31.3 percent), and for skilled workers. Higher education graduates, however,
represent only 20 percent of unemployed workers aged 15-34, while one-third of the
unemployed population has no diploma.17 Overall, it appears that unemployment is much
higher for graduates from “open enrollment? university programs (22.3 percent), secondary
education (21.7 percent) and vocational training (19.7 percent), particularly short vocational
training programs (25.2 percent). Unfortunately, detailed information on the labor market
entry rates of higher education graduates – broken down by characteristics such as region,
discipline and level – is not yet available. Better information is available for vocational
training graduates, where employment rates are significantly higher in some areas
(construction, engineering, fisheries and tourism) than in others (textile, information
technology and management).

41.      School-to-work transition is a major problem, with first-time job-seekers
representing half of the unemployed population. Unemployment spells are mainly of long
duration, especially in the case of skilled workers. In fact, the incidence of long-term (i.e.,
longer than 12 months) unemployment is 83 percent among skilled workers, compared with
60 percent among the unskilled unemployed. This situation points to the structural nature of
unemployment in Morocco and the need for targeted interventions to retrain the long-term
unemployed and facilitate the job search process. Indeed, long-term unemployment can
reduce the chances of finding a job as workers lose skills and because of negative signaling.

42.         Youth unemployment co-exists with a high level of inactivity. According to a
recent World Bank study,18 the proportion of young men who are inactive (25 percent) is, in
fact, greater than the percentage of those who are unemployed (16 percent). Most young men
are inactive because they are discouraged. Ninety-three percent of young women with no
education are out of the labor force, compared to only 37 percent of young women with
higher education, suggesting higher returns to education as well as their greater ability to
overcome social barriers to participating in the labor force.

III.B. Government program

III.B.1. Socio-economic program

43.         The PJD election platform emphasized anti-corruption and set out policy proposals
to deliver on good governance, justice, revamping the delivery and quality of social services
and improving people’s economic inclusion. As part of its mandate, the Government is
charged with implementing the changes proposed in the new Constitution as regards putting
in place a new institutional model based on separated, balanced and complementary powers.
In particular, the new Constitution reinforces the principles of good governance, human
rights, protection of individual freedoms, as well as more responsibility and accountability for
institutions. These themes are all central to the Government’s 2012-2016 program, which was
presented to Parliament in January 2012.

44.         As regards good governance, the areas of future focus are multiple, including
public administration reform, simplification of procedures, access to information, reform of
fiscal system, budget reform, regionalization and decentralization, and a profound reform of
the justice sector. Social solidarity, participation and inclusion are all emphasized with a
special focus on youth and families. Improving the transparency of economic and financial
governance is given particular mention with a strengthening of the Competition Council and
improving governance of state-owned enterprises.

45.         For the period 2012-2016, the program aims for a growth rate of 5.5 percent, an
inflation rate of 2 percent, reducing unemployment to 8 percent and aiming for a progressive
reduction in the budget deficit to 3 percent by 2016. Key areas of priority on the economic
front include strengthening the competitiveness of the economy, improving the business
climate, support to SMEs, encouraging exports and land registry reform. Addressing
unemployment to bring the rate down to 8 percent by 2016 will demand an integrated
approach and includes measures to continue support to employment creation programs
undertaken to date and introduction of new programs to insert the unemployed into businesses
and associations. Social assistance and pension reform are also being pursued as part of a
broader and more comprehensive overhaul of the compensation system.

III.B.2. Education Emergency Program (PUEN) 2009-2012: project-based sector management

46.    The proposed operation itself recognizes the achievements of the second half of the
PUEN – 2011 and 2012 – and is aligned with the directions set out in the draft Education
Action Plan 2013-2016 (PAMT), which itself emphasizes continuity over the medium term in
education sector reform. As noted above, previous governments implemented a

comprehensive set of reform measures in the education sector, through the CNEF 1999-2009
and the PUEN 2009-2012. The impetus to promote education reforms in Morocco came in
part from the publication of major sector reports, including (i) the World Bank’s Flagship
Report in 2008 (“The Road Not Traveled?)19 and (ii) the CSE’s 2008 Annual Report.20

47.     The fundamental guiding principle of the PUEN placed the student at the heart of the
education and training system. The key goal was to provide the student with basic
competencies by establishing an environment conducive to learning and using qualified
teachers. The PUEN, spanning the period of 2009-12, drew on lessons learned during the
previous decade, and presented a comprehensive policy framework, with a sizeable
expenditure program (MAD 34 billion or US$4.1 billion), to significantly improve education
outcomes from pre-school to university. The PUEN pursued four strategic directions: (i)
achieve universal basic education; (ii) promote initiative and excellence in post-basic
education; (iii) improve system performance (teaching, management and stewardship); and
(iv) mobilize and utilize resources. Associated targets included increasing net enrollment
rates for pre-school, primary and lower secondary education from 48.2 percent, 90.5 percent,
and 42.7 percent in 2008/09 to 54.2 percent, 98.2 percent 56.4 percent, respectively by
2012/13.

48.     Over the PUEN period, Morocco witnessed significant results in primary education
(with near-universal access for girls and boys alike, lower repetition and drop-out rates and
higher completion rates), but less dramatic improvements in lower secondary education (with
large gaps between urban and rural participation and stubbornly high rates of repetition and
drop-out).     There was strong program ownership within the MEN and AREFs (with,
however, a notable lack of coordination across key PUEN projects), but it was noted that
province-level and particularly school-level players (namely, school principals and teachers)
were not sufficiently equipped to deliver the reforms effectively in the classroom. This was
particularly true, for example, of the projects aimed at identifying and remedying weak
learning performance through a child-centered, skills-based pedagogy. Whereas PUEN
implementation was well supported through administrative documentation (circulars,
guidelines and other written materials), school principals and classroom teachers had little
access to professional support from trainers, inspectors and other resource staff and suffered
at times from a lack of cross-project coordination. Finally, while the decentralization agenda
allowed important decisions to be taken locally on the basis of local information, the
decentralized entities (in particular the AREFs) often did not have the systems and tools to
manage PUEN implementation effectively.

III.B.2. Education Action Plan (PAMT) 2013-2016: quality schools and classrooms

49.     Human development is prioritized in the current Government’s program. For the
health sector, reducing infant and maternal mortality in order to achieve the MDGs is the
main priority. Supporting the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH) is also key
to the plan, as is the need to address housing shortages and focusing on women, youth and
disadvantaged people. In the area of education, the Government’s manifesto,21 adopted by the

Moroccan parliament on January 26, 2012, linked the quality of education to appropriate
governance arrangements. The central theme is to push decentralization to the school level.
On August 20, 2012, the King of Morocco, in a speech centered around youth,22 indicated that
education was at the top of the list of national priorities; he stressed the importance not just of
equitable access to education and training but also of equitable access to quality learning
opportunities, which he defined as equipping young people for “the life that awaits them? and
which therefore requires teachers to adopt a student-centered approach that encourages critical
thinking rather than memorization of facts.

50.     The draft PAMT 2013-2016, currently under internal discussion and external
consultation, adopts three principles that are derived from lessons learned during the
implementation of the CNEF 1999-2009 and the PUEN 2009-2012: (i) the PAMT 2013-2016
will consolidate and extend the achievements of the earlier cycles with a view to long-term
improvements, rather than engage in a radically new direction; (ii) major efforts will be made
to better prioritize key policy interventions, in order to focus resources on realistic goals; and
(iii) these policy interventions will be implemented in ways that rely on improved
coordination and greater coherency between the various actors, both vertically (between
central, regional, provincial and school levels) and horizontally (across services at a given
level). The key policy interventions, organized into four groupings, are an extension of the
PUEN achievements: (a) access and equity; (b) teaching and learning quality; (c) governance
and decentralization, through to the school level; and (d) human resource management. The
PAMT is likely to have an even greater emphasis than the PUEN on school-based
management and classroom-based teaching practices, as the Government is eager both to
ensure that school principals and teachers are better empowered and supported and that the
reforms designed at higher levels truly impact student learning achievement.

III.C. Implementation costs

51.     As seen in Figure 3, the Government backed its commitment to the PUEN 2009-2012
by increasing the budget allocated to the school education sector, with a significant initial
boost in 2009. Over the period of PUEN implementation, public expenditure on school
education has remained steady as a share of GDP around 6 percent and has fluctuated
somewhat as a share of the overall State budget around 25 percent. This fiscal effort has
focused on non-salary expenditures, with the share of the budget going to investment and non-
salary recurrent items rising from 16.6 percent in 2008 to 25.7 percent in 2009, 26.5 percent
in 2010, 31.9 percent in 2011 and 27.7 percent in 2012. The overall cost of the PUEN 2009-
2012 was estimated at MAD 34.0 billion (US$4.1 billion), averaging MAD 8.5 billion per
year, which corresponds to largest part of the investment and non-salary recurrent budget.
The cost has been shared between the Government (around four-fifths) and the TFPs (around
one-fifth).

III.D. Participatory process

53.     Since 2006, the CSE has served as the main forum for wide-ranging consultation on
education policy. The CSE, which answers directly to the King, has around 100 members
drawn from the Government, the Parliament, specialized State entities, MEN staff, AREFs,
universities, teacher unions, parent associations, student organizations, industry, and NGOs.
The CSE is consulted on all education reform, advises on all national education matters and
carries out comprehensive evaluations of the national education system of education. With

23
  EIB’s commitment amounts may vary from year to year, within the fixed total amount.
24
  The Neighborhood Investment Facility (NIF) is a separate funding facility financed by contributions from EC
and member states.

                                                                         18
the CSE, Morocco has a permanent and independent source of advice that reflects the
different components of society.

54.     As part of the development of its PUEN 2009-2012, the Government engaged in
consultations with various stakeholders. In the fall of 2007, the King of Morocco instructed
the Government to develop the PUEN to speed up the implementation of the education reform
agenda. During the first round of program development, the consulting firm hired to provide
technical assistance to the Government consulted with regional and provincial education
officials, focusing on a number of pilot sites. In a second round, the MEN met with
parliamentarians and teacher union representatives to present the draft program and receive
feedback. With the third round of development, the MEN tested the feasibility of the final
draft by consulting with governors, as well as regional and provincial education officials, in a
series of regional forums, again in pilot sites.

55.    In preparing its PAMT 2013-2016, the MEN intends to consult with a range of
stakeholders both inside and outside the education sector – teacher unions, parents, students,
communities – before presenting the program to the CSE for validation and then to the
Government for final approval.

IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S STRATEGY

IV.A. Link to the Country Partnership Strategy

56.     The Country Partnership Strategy25,26 (CPS) comprises three pillars. These pillars are:
(i) encouraging growth, competitiveness and employment; (ii) improving quality service
delivery to citizens; and (iii) promoting sustainable development within the context of climate
change. Other cross cutting themes, such as regional development, governance, public private
partnerships, and regional integration, are also covered. The proposed operation is part of the
Bank’s support to the second CPS pillar and, as such, will address the issue of quality
education service delivery through: (a) improved management of the sector by way of
increased decentralization to, and accountability of, the AREFs; (b) increased targeting as a
means to reach the most vulnerable; and (c) enhanced accountability of education personnel.
The proposed operation is also aligned with the Bank’s new framework for engagement in
MENA, with its focus on improving the social and economic inclusion of disadvantaged
groups, strengthening governance through transparency and accountability, and on gender
equality.

IV.B. Collaboration with the International Monetary Fund and other donors

57.     The World Bank and the IMF maintain a close collaboration in Morocco. Regular
exchanges between Fund and Bank country teams are customary. Discussions focus on the
respective work programs, country priorities, recent developments and prospects, and reflect
the growing weight of DPLs in the Bank’s Morocco portfolio. The Fund participates in Bank
project review meetings where relevant. Similarly, Bank staff was consulted in the context of

the IMF’s 2012 Article IV consultation with Morocco, which was concluded by the IMF’s
Board on February 1, 2013. The IMF has also completed its first review of Morocco’s
performance under the economic program supported by the PLL arrangement (approved on
August 3, 2012 in an amount equivalent to about US$6.2 billion) and reaffirmed Morocco’s
continued qualification to access PLL resources. The Public Information Notice issued by the
IMF on February 5, 2013 is provided in Annex 4.

58.     The proposed operation was prepared in close consultation and coordination with main
donors active in Morocco’s education sector. The Government demonstrated great interest in
the results of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. As a result, the Government
requested the World Bank and the donor community to support the reform program, using the
principles of the Declaration. A non-binding partnership framework has been signed by the
Government and a wide group of donor representatives (including the World Bank) with a
view to encouraging donor support in the education sector.

59.     The World Bank works closely with other donors. In line with the main principles put
forward by the partnership framework, the World Bank joined with six major sector donors
(AECID, AFD, AfDB, EIB, EU and JICA) to form the TFP Group, offering technical and
financial support to the Government as it implemented its PUEN. This level of harmonization
among major donors marks an important advance in donor relations with the Government.
AECID, AfDB, EU and the World Bank are providing their funds in the form of budget
support; AFD and EIB (along with the EU’s Neighborhood Investment Facility [NIF]) are
providing programmatic investment financing; JICA is using a hybrid instrument, partly
budget support (adopting the World Bank’s policy matrix and adding four prior actions of its
own related especially to school-level management)27 and partly project investment financing.

60.     The TFP Group worked together with the Government to establish a common results
framework and common monitoring and reporting arrangements that underpin each TFP’s
support of the PUEN. While the overall results framework is common to all TFPs, each TFP
has its own financing operation with prior actions that differ slightly from one to another. All
TFPs other than the World Bank have signed their respective financing agreements with the
Government, for a total commitment amount of EU€ 433.0 million (US$579.2 million
equivalent) over four years. To provide a structure for coordinating their parallel financing
operations with the Government’s own PUEN implementation, the TFPs and the Government
developed a memorandum of understanding and an associated operational manual. The
memorandum28 has been signed by the Government, AFD, AfDB, EU and EIB; while the
World Bank has not signed the memorandum, it operates in accordance with the principles set
out therein.




27
   JICA-specific prior actions: [1] Reinforce the concept of monitoring the school and support mechanisms to
improve education and learning processes; [2] Ensure the effective implementation of the « school project »
based on the new concept; [3] Develop and formalize organizational, pedagogical and technical process of
implementation of Regional Teacher Training Centers; and [4] Motivate parents and community members to
enroll and keep their children in school at the level of basic education (primary and secondary).
28
   The memorandum provides that where there is a conflict between the memorandum and the individual
financing agreements the latter prevail.

                                                    20
IV.C. Relationship to other Bank operations

61.     The Bank has a long history of active engagement in Morocco’s education and other
social sectors. Over the past decade, four relevant projects -- Social Priorities (Education)
Program (4024-MOR), Alpha Maroc (Adult Literacy) Project (4607-MOR), Social
Development Agency Project (4661-MOR) and PARSEM (7273-MOR) -- were fully
executed. These operations assisted the Government in: (i) increasing access to basic
education, literacy and other social services; and (ii) improving the quality and effectiveness
of service delivery. Overall, these projects were implemented successfully with respect to the
objective of increasing access to basic services and promoting participatory approaches and
partnership arrangements.29 The Social Priorities (Education) Program and the Social
Development Agency project results were remarkable in this regard. Achievements regarding
quality of service delivery were less positive.

62.     The proposed Second Education Development Loan (EDPL2) builds on the First
Education Development Loan (EDPL1) (7879-MOR), which closed on March 31, 2011.
These two basic education operations are complemented by other DPLs under preparation that
seek to address other key constraints to promoting the type of growth that will create good
quality jobs in Morocco and that target service delivery improvements in education and skills
and in other areas of the public administration system. The dialogue across these different
operations (see descriptions below) has been closely coordinated.

63.     The First Skills and Employment DPL, developed through a partnership bringing
together four ministries – education, labor, finance and economic affairs – seeks to: (i) match
skills developed within the vocational training and higher education systems to the needs of
the labor market; (ii) improve the effectiveness of intermediation services, including active
labor market programs; (iii) improve job quality; and (iv) strengthen the labor market
information system.

64.     The First Economic Competitiveness Support Program DPL aims at: (i) improving the
investment climate, in particular by removing barriers to entry and competition, simplifying
the regulatory environment for doing business and reducing discretion in the implementation
of the rules by increasing transparency and access to information; (ii) furthering trade policy
reform and trade facilitation, in particular by pursuing the ongoing tariff rationalization (levels
and bands), strengthening the regulatory framework for import standards and easing logistics
at ports of entry; and (iii) improving economic governance, by strengthening significantly the
Competition Agency’s missions and prerogatives, increasing transparency and accountability
in the way the investment incentives are granted and sectoral policies conducted, and
strengthening the public-private coordination body for investment climate reforms.

65.     The Second Financial Sector DPL (under preparation) continues to support the reform
agenda already initiated under the First Financial Sector DPL approved by the Board in
January 2010. Specifically, it fosters: (i) household and small and medium enterprises (SME)
access to financial services; (ii) increased financial stability, supervision and regulation; and
(iii) capital market development. Key reforms supported include a new guarantee scheme
targeting micro-enterprises and measures to strengthen the functioning of private equity
markets.

29
     PARSEM was closed in June 2009 and the ICR delivered in December 2009.

                                                    21
66.     The Accountability and Transparency DPL is being prepared to build on the Bank’s
previous engagement in public sector administration reform. There is broad agreement with
the Government that this new DPL series will focus on accountability, transparency and
public service delivery reforms, in line with the goals and objectives of Morocco's transition
as envisaged under the new constitution, thus focusing on school to work transition.

IV.D. Lessons learned

67.    The proposed operation design was informed by lessons learned from the above-
mentioned projects and sector DPLs in Morocco, as well as from general experience with
human development sector DPLs implemented in other countries. Main lessons learned are
summarized below, first those concerning education policy and second those linked to reform
processes.

IV.D.1. Education policy lessons

68.     International experience brings to bear lessons on a number of areas that are featured
in the proposed operation.

69.    First, demand-side interventions have improved retention where they include
conditional cash transfers (used in contexts as diverse as Mexico and New York), school
transport, school feeding (supported throughout the developing world by the World Food
Program).

70.    Second, assessing student performance is critical to inform practitioners (teachers,
school leadership, as well as local and national decision-makers) of the true level of students
and schools. In addition, disseminating results to concerned stakeholders, like parents and
communities, has been shown to exert a positive effect on the accountability of education
providers because assessment results give content to a stakeholder’s voice.30

71.     Third, pre- and in-service training should focus on adapted instructional practices for:
(i) improving literacy in early grades (which could include pilots on using national languages,
such as those used in West Africa, for example, in the Gambia); (ii) teaching to heterogeneous
learning levels (differentiated pedagogy is used in France); and (iii) remedial instruction.
International evidence reveals that all these have the potential to improve repetition and drop-
out rates. Workshops to demonstrate how best to use the student record booklet would also be
beneficial, as these can form the basis of personalized work plans for students. Good
monitoring of teacher in-service training is essential to discover to what extent the lessons
have been appropriated by the learner (the in-service teachers in this case) and how they will
change their instructional practices in class. This is the only way the efficacy of the in-service
modules can be gauged; waiting for class inspections is too late. In the absence of effective
in-service training, collaboration – the extent to which educators work together on behalf of
students – is also an important predictor of success. Teachers who work closely with other
teachers to improve their instruction, adhere to the norms associated with peer review.31

72.     Fourth, school-based management initiatives should focus in their action plans on
improving school climate, which directly affects retention. International evidence from
TIMSS 2011 reveals that, in Morocco, only 29 percent of Grade 4 and 26 percent of Grade 8
Moroccan students report that their school is ‘safe and orderly’ compared to the international
average of 45 percent and 49 percent for the same grades. International research shows that
when education authorities delegate more responsibilities to schools to mobilize and manage
the inputs necessary to address local circumstances and changing demand for education
services, there is a wide range of configurations possible. Nevertheless, more autonomous
schools have three features of note: (i) the margin of freedom of schools to acquire and
manage resources (financial, human, material) as they see fit to meet expected results; (ii) the
possibility of diversifying sources of revenue; and (iii) greater use of performance-based
agreements tied to resource allocation.

73.      Within the Morocco setting, the EDPL1 Implementation Completion and Results
        32
Report showed that many of the EDPL1 prior actions “set the ground? for longer term
improvement in educational outcomes. For example, the results of the first national student
learning survey (EDPL1 Prior Action1.2) provoked public debate in the quality of education.
The transfer of initial pre-service teacher training to universities (EDPL1 Prior Action1.3) has
allowed for a stronger recruitment-on-merit process. The strategic human resource
management action plan (EDPL1 Prior Action1.4) laid the groundwork for the
decentralization of human resource management. The AREF-MEN program-contracts
(EDPL1 Prior Action1.5) laid down a contractual “spirit?—introducing new performance
monitoring and reporting practices and thus increased accountability—even if the contracting
arrangements have not been formalized with rewards and sanctions. With new discretionary
budgets (EDPL1 Prior Action1.6), schools were able to take decisions to fund their own
priorities and over time these priorities have tended to move from physical repairs (e.g.,
broken windows) to out-of-school activities and increasingly to activities aimed at increasing
learning outcomes. The MEN has continued to update its MTEF (EDPL1 Prior Action1.7) on
an annual basis and reports both better planning and greater visibility for short- and medium-
term goals and more effective management of resources. Finally, the charter on relations
between schools and their parent associations (EDPL1 Prior Action1.9) provided a framework
for greater parental involvement in their children’s schooling.

IV.D.2. Reform process lessons

74.     Government ownership and commitment are key to the success of the reform program.
The PUEN, from which the content of the proposed operation is drawn, has been fully owned
by the Government and supported by the highest authorities in the country. To ensure
success, it is necessary to establish and maintain support within the administration and to
establish communication channels among the various actors at central, regional, provincial
and school levels.

75.    The effective implementation of some reforms requires time, especially in the human
development sectors, as shown in the transition from EDPL1 to EDPL2. It is important to
take into consideration the time required to build up executing agencies’ capacity when
preparing the reform implementation plan, especially when the agencies are at the

32
  Report No: ICR00002495. See Sections 2.1 and 3.2 for a detailed analysis of the on-going results of each of
the EDPL1 prior actions.

                                                     23
developmental stages. The point was discussed at length with the authorities and has led to
better prioritization of the reform program, geared by the principle of selectivity and realism.

76.     Success in reform implementation, especially in the human development sectors,
depends to a great extent on the existing institutional capacity and sustained consensus among
the main stakeholders. Addressing these key challenges requires a fully-fledged medium-
term strategy and good coordination. The Government is aware of these issues and lays out a
range of measures and activities in this direction. In addition, the ongoing coordination
among donors providing direct investment and budgetary support offers the opportunity to
respond meaningfully to the critical capacity building needs.

77.     As noted above, the MEN carried out its own evaluation of the PUEN 2009-2012,
drawing lessons that will inform the development of its PAMT 2013-2016: (i) effective
education reform requires a long-term commitment to core goals and, as a result, a significant
level of continuity from one cycle of change to the next; (ii) policy interventions need to be
clearly prioritized in line with the overall vision, in order to focus scarce resources on realistic
goals; and (iii) coordination and greater coherency between the various actors, both vertically
(between central, regional, provincial and school levels) and horizontally (across services at a
given level) is needed to ensure that policy interventions truly impact classroom-level
practice.

IV.E. Analytical underpinnings

78.     Substantial analytical work underpinned the preparation of the Government’s PUEN
and PAMT and the preparation of the proposed operation. First, the Bank analytic program
led to the production of an education sector policy note,33 a report on school absenteeism and
time-on-task in the classroom,34 and a report on skills development and employment,35 whose
findings shaped the sectoral dialogue. Second, the CSE’s 2008 Annual Report36 provided a
comprehensive and frank diagnosis of the state and performance of the education sector and
laid out recommendations for improving the country’s education outcomes. The CSE
recommended inter alia: (i) improved learning achievement assessments; (ii) a more open
policy concerning the recognition of language as a quality improvement mechanism; and (iii)
the promotion of the private sector in improving access and quality. Third, the World Bank’s
Flagship Report in 2008 (“The Road Not Traveled?)37 contributed to a public debate on the
level of education sector outcomes and the need to improve design and accountability
measures in the sector. Though achievements have been made in expanding access through
construction in both urban and rural areas, increased teacher training, and revision to the
curricula, there has been less attention to management of the sector, incentives, and
accountability. Fourthly, a Public Expenditure Review (PER), completed in 2012, points to
inefficiencies in the school education system: public spending, as a proportion of both the

overall national budget and GDP, is high by international standards whereas results are
average (primary enrollment rates) to below-average (repetition rates, gender equity in
secondary education, scores in international learning assessment surveys). The proposed
operation focusses on these issues, responding also to the CPS’s emphasis on governance
strengthening and on service delivery improvement.

79.     Additional analytical and advisory assistance would have facilitated the
implementation of a range of reforms, particularly those involving decentralized governance.
This was recognized by the Government and the TFP Group and led to the identification of
core studies that were to be carried out during the PUEN implementation period and funded in
large part by the EU-Technical Assistance Fund or its NIF. For reasons related primarily to
the MEN’s weak capacity in consultancy contract management (including procurement
procedures), only a small part of this program was realized.

V.      THE PROPOSED EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT POLICY PROGRAM

V.A.    Operation description

80.     The proposed EDPL2 was originally designed as the second and last operation in a
programmatic DPL series to accompany the implementation of the Government’s PUEN over
the period 2009-2012. The EDPL1, which was approved by the World Bank Executive Board
on June 8, 2010, became effective on August 9, 2010 and closed on March 31, 2011,
supported key initial institutional and regulatory measures as well as the introduction of new
approaches to improve service delivery effectiveness and efficiency. The proposed EDPL2 is
designed to support deepening institutional reforms and scaling up the program to tackle core
cross-cutting issues. The MEN’s slow implementation of its PUEN resulted in considerable
delays in completing most of the triggers originally agreed for EDPL2, thus, the two
operations have been delinked and the Bank team has prepared an ICR for the EDPL1 in
February 2013. Although the EDPL1 and EDPL2 operations no longer form a programmatic
series for administrative purposes, the Government and the Bank wish to maintain the spirit of
the series and the EDPL2 prior actions are in large part consistent with the triggers that were
agreed for this second operation at the time the EDPL1 was approved.

81.      The proposed operation’s development objective is to strengthen the schools sector’s
institutional arrangements in the short term, in ways that in the medium term will: (i) increase
access to school education, especially for rural girls and boys at the lower secondary level; (ii)
improve the quality of teaching and learning in primary and lower secondary education; and
(iii) enhance efficiency in decentralized governance of the schools sector.

82.      The EDPL2 prior actions (which are summarized in Box 1 below) and results
indicators are set out in the Policy Matrix provided in Annex 2. (The EDPL1 prior actions are
also listed in Annex 2, for reference.)

Box 1. Prior Actions for the Second Education Development Policy Loan

The Government has agreed upon and implemented the following prior actions before the presentation
of the Loan to the World Bank Executive Board:
• Prior Action EDPL2.1: The MEN has developed new criteria for locating primary schools and
     colleges, with priority given to rural and semi-urban areas, and has instructed each AREF to adopt

                                                 25
    and apply these criteria;
•   Prior Action EDPL2.2: The MEN has developed and adopted on November 26, 2012, a social
    support action plan for 2012/2013 consolidating and integrating social programs including school
    supplies, canteen/hostels, transport and conditional cash transfer program;
•   Prior Action EDPL2.3: Each of five AREFs has established its Regional Assessment and Testing
    Center, and carried out its regional student learning assessment activities;
•   Prior Action EDPL2.4: The MEN, in compliance with the provisions of Decree No. 2.11.672 dated
    December 23, 2011, signed by the Prime Minister and published in the Official Gazette of February
    2, 2012, has established fifteen (15) Regional Teacher Training Centers covering the sixteen (16)
    regions of the Borrower, and has developed and adopted competency guidelines for pre-service
    teacher education (pre-school/primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary education);
•   Prior Action EDPL2.5: The MEN has developed and adopted a mechanism for rationalizing human
    resource allocation in the schools sector (covering teacher redeployment, mobility and retention);
•   Prior Action EDPL2.6: The Minister of Education has issued Orders (Arrêtés) No. 113.13 and
    114.13 dated January 2, 2013 transferring to AREFs the responsibility for human resource
    management decisions not subject to the MEF’s prior review;
•   Prior Action EDPL2.7: The MEN has evaluated the results of, and has drawn lessons from, the first
    years of implementation of school charters and their funding, on the basis of a representative
    sample of schools;
•   Prior Action EDPL2.8: Each AREF has established its internal audit unit in compliance with Letter
    No. 12-663 dated May 31, 2012, from the Minister of Education, and has approved the audit unit’s
    work plan for 2013 in compliance with Letter No. 2-5405 dated December 27, 2012, from the
    Minister of Education.



83.     The proposed operation provides budget and technical support for the refinement and
implementation of the national education sector reform program, and was developed in close
coordination with the Government to ensure full ownership of the processes, actions and
outcomes. The Government and the Bank recognize that under Government leadership, the
Bank can play a critical role in bringing sector knowledge and experience, strengthening
cross-sectoral policy dialogue between various government entities (especially linking sector
development outcomes to the country’s overall economic framework), and ensuring sustained
commitment toward effective reform of the sector.

Box 2. Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce ownership.
The design of this operation has been fully client driven and thus enjoys solid country ownership. The
Government embarked on a comprehensive reform of the education and training system, with the
promulgation of the 1999 National Education and Training Charter (CNEF). The CNEF, developed
with strong national consensus, receives strong support from the donor community, but the
implementation of the reform program has encountered delays. In 2008, an Education Emergency
Program (PUEN) was drawn up to accelerate this reform process. The proposed operation supports the
Government in the implementation of this strategy.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework.
The proposed operation is prepared in parallel with four other donors’ operations. The AFD, the AfDB,
the EIB, the EU and the World Bank worked actively with the Government on the design of
coordinated policy matrices and a common set of performance indicators. AECID and JICA joined the

                                                 26
consortium after the PUEN was launched and have joined the shared accountability framework. Donor
alignment on the reform program objectives was also achieved through joint missions, informal
consultations and regular updates by staff of respective institutions.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances.
By design, the program fully reflects country’s circumstances, priorities and institutional
responsibilities as indicated by the Government. For the more complex policy reforms, the donor
consortium is providing technical assistance to carry out the necessary underpinning analytic work.
The proposed operation has also benefited from the lessons learned from the previous education
operations and other DPL operations in Morocco, and benefits from the flexibility embedded in the
CPS.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement.
Prior actions have been identified through a process of extensive consultations with the MEN, the MEF,
and with the other members of the donor consortium. The jointly agreed policy matrix uses a limited
set of prior actions across the selected policy areas and is aligned with good practice principles. The
prior actions are focused on steps considered critical to achieving results on the ground and sequenced
to support consistent progress towards program objectives.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support.
Joint multi-donor progress reviews take place twice a year, timed so as to allow for a predictable review
of progress and announcement of support levels at the beginning of the budget year. The results
framework, which includes outcome indicators that are assessed as part of operation implementation
and mid-term review, is closely linked to the Government’s own PUEN results measurement system.


V.B.    Policy areas

84.     The proposed operation’s prior actions, organized under three main policy areas – (I)
achieve universal basic education; (II) improve system performance (teaching, management
and stewardship); and (III) mobilize and utilize resources – are outlined below and then
detailed in the Program Policy Matrix (Annex 2). These critical actions respond to crucial
strategic issues such as the impact of poverty on schooling (through both supply-side and
demand-side actions that target rural and semi-urban areas), low quality of student
achievement (through both national surveys and regional structures), poor teacher efficiency
and accountability (through teacher education and human resource management), weak
implementation capacity at the decentralized level (through region-level initiatives, including
financial management improvement in AREFs) and lack of "voice" for stakeholders (through
improved school-parent structures).

V.B.1. Policy Area 1: Achieve universal basic education

85.     Description. The Government aims to achieve compulsory basic education by
rationalizing the use of physical capacities and enhancing measures for greater equity in
school access and retention.

86.    Challenge. Despite major advances in expanding access to primary and lower
secondary education, a 20-point gap still exists between urban and rural areas for both girls
and boys at the lower secondary level, and drop-out rates remain (see Annex 3). Overall,

                                                  27
some 80 percent of students complete the full six years of primary schooling, while some 60
percent complete the nine years of primary and lower secondary schooling combined (see
Annex 3). Barriers to ongoing schooling include physical access (e.g., distance from school),
socio-economic status (e.g., direct and indirect costs of schooling), low quality of service
provision (e.g., teacher absenteeism, poor teaching quality) and cultural attitudes (e.g.,
concerns over safety of children attending school).

87.     Government measures. In order to address issues of access and retention, the MEN
has identified a range of supply-side and demand-side measures. On the supply side, the MEN
continues with an ambitious school construction program and has defined new criteria for the
selection of sites to build and implant new schools, involving local administrations in the
decision-making process and giving priority to level of demand for schooling (especially in
rural and semi-urban areas), integration within a network of infrastructure and appropriate
environmental considerations. Teacher deployment has become more efficient in recent
years, with a greater proportion of teachers delivering their full teaching load (see Prior
Action EDPL2.5 under Policy Area II). On the demand side, the MEN is moving to
consolidate and integrate a series of interventions -including school transport, school feeding
programs, student accommodation, provision of learning materials and a conditional cash
transfer program for school attendance – in ways that better target needy students and their
families. The low quality of student learning is being addressed through participation in
international student achievement surveys, a national student achievement assessment tool,
and the establishment of regional structures to monitor teaching and learning quality.

88.     EDPL2 prior actions. The prior actions under the EDPL2 “universal basic education?
policy area are as follows:
    • EDPL2.1. The MEN has developed new criteria38 for locating primary schools and
        colleges, with priority given to rural and semi-urban areas, and has instructed39 each
        AREF to adopt and apply these criteria. Where demand for new school capacity
        outstrips available financial resources, the rationing mechanism needs to ensure that
        decisions on infrastructure investment in general, and location of new schools in
        particular, are taken at the local level on the basis of objective and transparent criteria
        that correspond to the Government’s stated aim of narrowing the gap in enrollments
        between urban and rural/semi-urban areas.
    • EDPL2.2. The MEN has developed and adopted on November 26, 2012, a social
        support action plan for 2012/2013 consolidating and integrating social programs
        including school supplies, canteen/hostels, transport and conditional cash transfer
        program. At present, the provision of support is managed on a component-by-
        component basis (boarding facilities, school feeding programs, school transport
        facilities, and a conditional cash transfer program), rather than in an integrated manner
        that uses the commune as the unit of planning. By developing a global approach, the
        MEN will be able to develop methodologies for determining the optimal mix of
        support for a given commune. Improvements are also being pursued within the
        different programs, with household-targeting for the conditional cash transfer program
        and encouragement of local public-private partnerships in the area of school transport.

     •   EDPL2.3. Each of five AREFs has established its Regional Assessment and Testing
         Center, and carried out its regional student learning assessment activities.40 Even as
         the MEN develops its capacity at a national level to assess student learning as a tool
         for decision-makers at all levels, it is critical that the country also have the capacity to
         carry out assessment activities at the regional level. Regional-level activities,
         involving AREFs, will: (i) support implementation of national assessment activities at
         the local level; (ii) carry out assessment activities corresponding to specific local
         needs (e.g., examine further factors of school performance highlighted in national
         surveys); and (iii) provide technical support to province-, commune- and school-level
         assessment activities.

89.     Expected results. Under this policy area, it is expected that, by 2013/14: (i) all 65
schools (community schools and colleges) programmed for construction in that year will be
assigned to rural areas; (ii) there will be two new social support methodologies developed
since the application of the new social support action plan; and (iii) 14 Regional Assessment
and Testing Centers will have been established and all of the centers will be producing an
annual report.

V.B.2. Policy Area 2: Improve system performance (teaching, management and stewardship)

90.    Description. The Government aims to strengthen MEN staff competencies, especially
those of teachers, with a view to improving the delivery of classroom-based education
services.

91.     Challenge. Morocco spends heavily on its school teaching force. At around 6 percent
of GDP, Morocco’s public spending on school education is at the high end of the range for
countries with comparable national income; moreover, Morocco’s per-student spending is
also high among comparable countries: 17 percent of per capita GDP for primary education
and 40 percent for secondary education. Recurrent expenditures account for 86 percent of the
national school education budget and staff salaries take up 84 percent of the recurrent
expenditures.41 In 2011/12, nine out of every ten staff working in the public schools sector
were teachers.42 On the positive side, teacher deployment has become more efficient in recent
years, with a greater proportion of teachers delivering their full teaching load and an average
and a student-teacher ratio that has risen to reasonable levels (28 in primary, 24 in lower
secondary and 20 in upper secondary education). Student learning, as measured by
international standardized benchmarks, maintained a low level of quality over the last decade
against a backdrop of significant increases in access. That said, significant spending on
teachers, combined with weak results in the classroom, makes teacher management, teacher
professional development and teacher accountability key priorities for Government action.

92.    Government measures. The MEN is addressing teacher-related issues through a series
of measures. With a medium-term goal of having teachers recruited and managed at a
regional level and therefore making AREFs rather than the MEN teachers’ employers, the
MEN has moved to optimize teacher redeployment by favoring mobility within local–
provincial and regional–zones; the MEN is also progressively transferring human resource

   In comparison: teachers made up 81 percent of the staff working in the private school sector.

                                                      29
management functions to AREFs, starting with those that require little or no MEF oversight
and ending with those that require major MEF oversight. In the area of teacher professional
development, a major step has been taken to strengthen pre-service teacher training: pre-
service training for all teachers – pre-school/primary, lower secondary and upper secondary –
is now structured into a three-year undergraduate qualification and a follow-up year in one of
the newly created Regional Teacher Training Centers (CRMEF). Training materials,
including key competency guidelines for each level of teaching, have been prepared for use in
these CRMEFs. In-service teacher training has unfortunately been scaled back, as the MEN
looks for a mechanism, in association with teacher unions, that enables teachers to pursue
their professional development without reducing their class-contact time. Finally, the MEN is
also aiming to enhance teacher accountability through a “contracting? approach, but progress
with teacher unions has been slow on this topic.

93.     EDPL2 prior actions. The prior actions under the EDPL2 “system performance?
policy area are:
    • EDPL2.4. The MEN, in compliance with the provisions of Decree No. 2.11.672 dated
        December 23, 2011, signed by the Prime Minister and published in the Official
        Gazette of February 2, 2012, has established fifteen (15) Regional Teacher Training
        Centers covering the sixteen (16) regions of the Borrower, and has developed and
        adopted competency guidelines43 for pre-service teacher education (pre-
        school/primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary education). The MEN aims to
        improve the quality of new teachers by establishing a new pre-service teacher training
        system (university degree plus professional qualification). The guidelines describe the
        competencies that all new teachers must master as they graduate from this two-stage
        training system.
    • EDPL2.5. The MEN has developed and adopted a mechanism44 for rationalizing
        human resource allocation in the schools sector (covering teacher redeployment,
        mobility and retention). At present, there are a multitude of transactions that occur in
        the area of human resource allocation at the national, regional and provincial levels,
        which makes for an inefficient distribution of teachers and administrators across the
        schools sector. The MEN has put in place systems and procedures to streamline
        redeployment – both in enabling mobility and encouraging retention as required by
        local circumstances – particularly with a view to increasing AREFs’ authority in this
        domain. Although they have improved efficiency in administrative processing, these
        systems and procedures have, from 2008/09 to 2011/12, had little effect on equity of
        teacher deployment between urban and rural areas: (i) whereas the urban-rural gap in
        student-teacher ratios remained unchanged at the primary level (31 in urban schools
        and 25 in rural schools), the positions have reversed at the lower secondary level (from
        24 to 25 in urban schools and from 25 to 24 in rural schools); (ii) the ratio of male to
        female teachers did not change at the primary level (0.6 in urban schools and 1.9 in
        rural schools) or in urban lower secondary schools (1.4), but became less balanced in
        rural lower secondary schools (from 1.8 to 2.2).
    • EDPL2.6. The Minister of Education has issued Orders (Arrêtés) No. 113.13 and
        114.13 dated January 2, 2013 transferring to AREFs the responsibility for human
        resource management decisions not subject to the MEF’s prior review. As a further

         step in devolving human resource management, AREFs will be able to take decisions
         that have hitherto been taken only at the central level, provided that those decisions are
         not subject to MEF’s prior review. At a later stage, it is envisaged that even the
         decisions that are subject to MEF’s prior review will be handed on to AREFs.
     •   EDPL2.7. The MEN has evaluated the results of, and has drawn lessons from, the first
         years of implementation of school charters and their funding, on the basis of a
         representative sample of schools.45 Having encouraged schools to adopt their own
         charters and having provided for a transfer of a discretionary budget directly to school
         associations to fund charter actions, the MEN has carried out, with the support of the
         Canadian International Development Agency, a review of this new approach. The
         review primarily finds that the first school charters often focused on improving
         physical infrastructure – a library or a sports field – and recommends that the support
         provided through the Canadian project encourages schools to organize the second-
         generation charters around activities that improve learning outcomes over the
         medium-term.

94.     Expected results. Under this policy area, it is expected that, from 2010/11 to 2013/14:
(i) the number of students enrolled in Regional Teacher Training Centers will have increased
from 7,864 to 8,000; (ii) the number of Regional Teacher Training Center graduates assigned
to teaching positions will have increased from 5,517 to 8,000; (iii) the ratio of the urban
female-male teacher ratio to the rural female-male teacher ratio will have progressed from 3.0
to 1.6 in primary education and from 2.9 to 1.5 in lower secondary education; (iv) the ratio of
the urban student-teacher ratio to the rural student-teacher ratio will have progressed from 1.2
to 1.0 in primary education and from 1.2 to 1.0 in lower secondary education; (v) the
proportion of resource management decisions taken by AREFs will have increased to 50
percent; and (vi) revised guidelines for school charter development and funding use, based on
recommendations of the EDPL2.7 evaluation, will have been sent to all schools.

V.B.3. Policy Area 3: Mobilize and utilize resources

95.     Description. The Government aims to mobilize and better use resources through a
strategy that involves working both with central government partners as well as with school
communities and private sector partners.

96.     Challenge. The execution of the PUEN required sizeable financing – about MAD 34
billion (US$4.1 billion) over a four-year period (2009-12) – which represents a significant
increase of public sector financing over the implementation period. As public funding
follows the trend towards decentralized management, it becomes increasingly important that
the decentralized entities have the systems, tools and qualified personnel in place to oversee
the use of these resources. AREFs’ capacity in management in general, and financial
management in particular, is currently weak.

97.    Government measures. The MEN identified a series of saving and efficiency
measures, whose implementation would contribute to greater sustainability in the long run.
These include the reduction of repetition rates, the introduction of multi-subject teachers in
lower secondary education, teacher deployment and utilization measures, and contract-based

                                                       31
management. The MEN aims also to manage budgeting systems in a more effective manner,
developing better planning tools and strengthening AREFs ability to plan and execute
regional budgets. The Head of Government issued a circular applying the “Moroccan Good
Governance Code for State-owned Enterprises and Public Corporations?46 to all public
corporations including AREFs, with a view to enhancing performance, promoting
transparency and ensuring public accountability. The establishment of internal audit units and
the development of strong financial management information systems in all AREFs are
measures that follow the same logic.

98.        EDPL2 prior actions. The prior actions under the EDPL2 “resources? policy area are:
       •   EDPL2.8. Each AREF has established its internal audit unit in compliance with Letter
           No. 12-663 dated May 31, 2012, from the Minister of Education, and has approved the
           audit unit’s work plan for 2013 in compliance with Letter No. 2-5405 dated December
           27, 2012, from the Minister of Education. Despite having been established a decade
           ago, the AREFs in general still have weak financial management systems. This
           weakness not only hampers day-to-day management of the schools sector at the
           regional level but also limits AREFs’ accountability to the MEN, to Government in
           general, and to the public at large. The establishment of an internal audit unit in each
           of the sixteen AREFs, with qualified staff and an annual work plan, is aimed to
           reinforce a culture of transparency and accountability.

99.    Expected results. Under this policy area, it is expected that, by 2013/14, all of the
regional internal audit units will have produced an annual report during the previous year.

VI.        OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

VI.A. Poverty and social impact

100. The prior actions supported by the proposed operation are largely pro-poor and
promote equity and inclusion. Prior Actions 2.1 (new criteria for locating schools) and 2.2
(adoption of a social support action plan) are specifically designed to increase participation
and improve the school experience of children living in rural and semi-rural areas, who are
disproportionately likely to be poor and currently out-of-school. Prior Actions 2.3
(establishment of Regional Assessment and Teaching Centers [CREE]), 2.4 (establishment of
Regional Teacher Training Centers [CRMEF] with guidelines), 2.7 (evaluation of school
charters and funding) and 2.8 (establishment of regional internal audit unit with work plans)
are designed to improve the quality and efficiency of the teaching and learning process for all
students, but could in fact disproportionately benefit poorer and poorer-performing students
simply because of the emphasis on introducing nationwide standards in quality and efficiency.

101. While negative impacts are likely to be low, Prior Actions 2.5 (adoption of a
mechanism for rationalizing human resource allocation) and 2.6 (transfer of human resource
management decisions to AREFs) may generate some adverse social impact, inasmuch it will
likely impact lifestyles of teachers and their families and perhaps generate resentment. Aware
of the resistance, the MEN is approaching human resource management reform on an
incremental basis, consulting and discussing with the teachers’ unions to arrive at a solid
consensus over time.

                                                       32
VI.B. Gender and inclusion

102. As noted above, while the enrollment gap between urban boys and rural girls at the
primary education level narrowed to just 3.5 percentage points by 2012/13, the gap at higher
levels of the education system remains large, with 53 percentage points still separating urban
boys and rural girls at the lower secondary education level in 2012/13. At both primary and
lower secondary levels, girls’ and boys’ completion rates are now almost identical. The first
PNEA results show to small gender gaps in mathematics and science, but large gender gaps in
favor of girls in Arabic and French. Given then that the main gender gap concerns access to
secondary schooling for rural girls, the pro-poor measures mentioned above – Prior Actions
2.1 and 2.2 – include features, such as expanded school transport options and improved school
canteen and hostel facilities, that are designed to provide safe facilities that encourage rural
households to send their daughters to school. The MEN systematically collects and publishes
school statistics broken down by gender and by urban/rural settings.

VI.C. Environmental aspects

103. The proposed operation’s prior actions are not likely to have significant negative
effects on the environment, forestry and other natural resources. It is noted in particular that
the MEN’s school construction program lies outside the proposed operation.

VI.D. Implementation, monitoring and evaluation

VI.D.1. Implementation

104. Under Government leadership, the MEN was assigned overall responsibility for PUEN
implementation. Implementation was carried out under a matrix organizational structure with
a “thematic? dimension and a “regional? dimension, ensuring coherence in the execution of
the reforms. Central and regional steering committees were established, and these committees
were mirrored by similar structures also at the provincial and school levels. The Central
Steering Committee (CSC), chaired by the Minister, set overall PUEN objectives and
priorities, reconciles decisions, finds solutions to issues and provides a report-back system for
decision-making. The CSC comprised key members of the Minister’s Office, as well as the
Director of Strategy, Statistics, Strategy and Planning and the Director of Budget. The CSC
held regular meetings, sometimes including other central directors, the national coordinators
and/or the AREF directors. Regional Steering Committees (RSC), led by the local AREF
Director, guided the strategic direction of the Emergency Plan at the regional levels.
Specifically, the RSCs defined the implementation path of the regional programs, validated
the action plans and monitored their implementation. Finally, the MEN established a Project
Management Office, operated and staffed by a consulting firm, to carry out the core project
management functions at the central, regional and provincial levels.

105. More generally, according to the law47 establishing the network of AREFs, each
AREF is administered by a board comprising inter alia MEN representatives, the regional
council chairperson, the regional governor, the provincial governors, local authority
chairpersons, university rectors and representatives of teachers’ groups, parents’ groups and
employers’ groups. The AREF board meets at least twice a year, and is charged with
deciding on a work program and budget for the year ahead and presenting a report on the
preceding year’s work program. The AREF itself is managed by a director, with
responsibility at the regional level for developing education plans (including multi-year
school construction plans), executing school construction activities, supervising teaching and
evaluating learning in schools, carrying out devolved human resource management tasks
(including the organization of teacher professional development activities), licensing private
schools, and promoting relations with regional agencies with a view to improving education.

VI.D.2. Monitoring and evaluation

106. The proposed operation supports the results-based management put forward by the
Government’s PUEN and the draft PAMT. The implementation progress will be monitored
based on a results framework which comprises the results/outcomes indicators highlighted in
the policy matrix to measure progress regarding the three policy areas (see Annex 2), as well
as a set of sectoral performance indicators that are shared by all TFPs and incorporated into
their respective operations (see Annex 3). These indicators – net enrollment rates, completion
rates, and learning assessment results – will be disaggregated for gender and urban/rural areas.
These indicators will continue to be closely monitored during review missions.

VI.E. Fiduciary aspects

VI.E.1. Public Finance Management

107. In 2009, the World Bank and the EU carried out a joint Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment. The PEFA report confirmed substantial
progress in Public Finance Management (PFM) reforms in Morocco. The results based on the
PEFA ratings indicate in particular that Morocco has an overall credible, comprehensive, and
transparent budget. The PFM system also supports the achievement of aggregate fiscal
discipline, strategic allocation of resources and efficient service delivery. The main strengths
of the Moroccan PFM are the following aspects: (i) credible and transparent budget (since the
Ministry of Finance [MEF] publishes the annual budget on its website in a timely fashion),
(ii) transparency of taxpayer obligations and liabilities, (iii) timeliness and regularity of
Government banks account reconciliation, (iv) accurate and timely in-year budget reports
covering expenditures at both commitment and payment stages, and (v) strong cash and debt
management. The main challenges of the Morocco PFM relate to: (a) the budget
classification, since despite the level of detail, accuracy, and reliability, it does not yet allow
for reliable direct tracking of program-related spending being financed under priority
programs; (b) timeliness of annual statements which are submitted for external audit 15
months after the end of the fiscal year, (c) the limited extent of legislative scrutiny of external
audit reports, and (d) the insufficient frequency, scope and follow-up of audits. The
Government is committed to address these challenges and, in order to do so, has introduced
measures to: (1) move to a performance based budgeting framework, (2) develop a medium-
term expenditure framework (MTEF) to assist in fiscal sustainability, (3) modernize its
accounting and internal audit framework, and (4) improve revenue management. In
conclusion, the strength of Morocco’s PFM system and the Government’s commitment to
reform, taken together, are, in the Bank’s view, adequate to support the proposed operation.

VI.E.2. Sector Finance Management

108. The World Bank joined other TFP to monitor the PUEN’s fiduciary aspects even
though this is not a requirement of the Bank’s DPL arrangements. As a public administration
entity, the MEN is subject to an ex ante review of commitments and a review of payments in
line with the regulations in force. These reviews are carried out by the central Treasury
Department via the ministerial treasury unit. The MEN may in addition be reviewed ex post
by the Office of the Auditor-General and/or reviewed under the jurisdiction of the Court of
Audit. Likewise, AREFs, as public administrative corporations, are subject to financial
reviews conducted by the MEF’s Department of State-Owned Enterprises and Privatization.
The MEF appoints State comptrollers and paymasters responsible for the reviews provided for
in Law No. 69-00 on State Financial Review of State-Owned Enterprises and Other Entities.
While some progress has been made in improving AREFs’ existing fiduciary management
capacity during the past years, some weaknesses remain and require further strengthening.

109. A mid-term external technical audit of the PUEN highlighted weaknesses in program
accounting and administrative procedures, as well as in internal control and the procurement
of works and schooling equipment. These internal control deficiencies could negatively
impact program delivery and weaken program accountability. As a response to the audit
findings and recommendations, the MEN prepared an action plan to improve the reliability of
financial and accounting data and further strengthen the capacity of regional staff in
                                               35
procurement and financial management. For each action, a responsible party has been
identified. The main actions include: (i) preparing an operations manual for each unit
including job descriptions, (ii) establishing an internal audit unit in each AREF (an action
supported by this DPL), (iii) setting up an accounting information system, (iv) enhancing the
archiving system, and (v) improving staff knowledge of procurement procedures. Moreover,
the MEN has published a list of 44 companies which could be excluded from the PUEN due
to their non-compliance with their contracts terms.

110. The Government and TFP have agreed that a second audit of the PUEN will be carried
out after its completion. The purpose of this audit will be to ensure that the expenses made by
the centralized and decentralized services are compliant with public financial management
procedures and guarantee quality in the works and equipment provided. The audit will also
follow up on the action plan prepared after the mid-term audit and the actions implemented to
satisfy the recommendations highlighted.

VI.E.3. Foreign exchange

111. Although the IMF has not conducted a safeguard assessment of the BAM, the latter is
audited on a yearly basis with the audit report being disclosed publicly. The World Bank has
received the 2009, 2010 and 2011 audits, which were unqualified, but, despite a formal
request sent to the BAM Governor on March 5, 2012 with respect to DPL operations, the
World Bank has not had access to the associated management letters and has therefore limited
information on the foreign exchange control environment. Therefore, as with recently
negotiated DPLs, a dedicated account will be used.

VI.E.4. Disbursement and audit

112. With reference to the flow of funds, the proposed loan will follow the World Bank’s
disbursement procedures for development policy lending. Once the loan becomes effective,
the proceeds of the loan will be disbursed in a single installment. Specifically, disbursements
will be made, provided that the World Bank is satisfied with the program being carried out by
the Borrower, and with the appropriateness of the Borrower's macroeconomic policy
framework. The account into which the loan proceeds will be deposited forms part of the
country's official foreign exchange reserves. Flow of funds (including foreign currency
exchange) is subject to standard public financial management processes. The government
budget is comprehensive, unified and subject to centralized treasury account.

113. The loan proceeds will be deposited by the International Bank of Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) in a dedicated account opened for this DPL by the Borrower and
acceptable to the World Bank at the BAM, upon submission of a signed withdrawal
application.

114. The Borrower should ensure that upon the deposit of loan proceeds into said account,
an equivalent amount, in the local currency, is credited to the treasury current account at the
central Treasury Department. The Borrower will report to the Bank within thirty days of
disbursement on the amounts deposited in the dedicated account and credited to the budget
management system providing the exchange rate applied and the date of the transfer. If the
proceeds of the loan are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Loan Agreement, IBRD
will require the Borrower to promptly upon notice refund an amount equal to the amount of
                                             36
said payment to IBRD. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled.
The loan proceeds will be administered by the MEF.

115. IBRD reserves the right to ask for a transaction audit of the dedicated account. This
audit, when asked for, will cover the accuracy of the transactions (credits and debits) of the
dedicated account, including accuracy of exchange rate conversions, confirming that the
dedicated account was used only for the purposes of the operation where no other amounts
have been deposited into the account. Also the auditor would have to obtain confirmation
from corresponding bank(s) involved in the funds flow regarding the transaction. The time
period for submission of the audit report to the World Bank would be four months from the
date a request for such audit is issued.

VI.E.5. Procurement

116. The Public Procurement Decree (PPD), approved by the Cabinet on December 28,
2012 and due to become effective on September 1, 2013, addresses many of the weaknesses
of the Moroccan procurement system that had been identified in recent assessments conducted
by the Bank. These assessments of the Moroccan procurement system (Use of Country
Procurement Systems in Bank-Supported Operations [UCS] in 2010 and Country
Procurement Assessment Review [CPAR] in 2008), showed that the procedures, regulations
and standards are broadly satisfactory despite the shortcomings in the systems that handle
complaints, fraud and corruption. The PPD applies to public administration, local
governments, State-owned enterprises and public corporations of administrative nature,
including AREFs, was before its approval the subject of extensive consultation. In addition, a
draft Procurement Board Decree was published on April 8, 2013 public consultation and
comments. With this second decree, the Procurement Board, which has in its mandate the
handling of complaints, would be renamed the National Commission for Public Procurement,
its independence and decision-making power would be increased, and its management
capacities would be strengthened with a view to it becoming more functional and efficient,
and having the appropriate tools and skills to fulfill its mandate. Besides these reform
initiatives, an in-depth dialogue is under way between the Bank and the Government on
procurement reform. With the new decree becoming effective soon, there will be a need for its
dissemination among AREFs and, more generally, capacity building efforts towards
improving the performance of AREFs in procurement.

VI.F. Risks and risk mitigation

117. Two major risks may endanger medium-term macroeconomic stability. The first risk,
which is exogenous, is linked to a deterioration of the economic situations its main trading
partners in Europe. Continuous sluggish external demand and higher prices of basic food and
oil would add more stress to both the balance of payments and public finance. The second,
endogenous, would emerge in case the government fails to implement its critical reform
agenda starting in 2013 to consolidate public finance and enhance export potential, including
tourism. Critical to maintaining macroeconomic stability are the subsidy, fiscal and pension
reforms, along with improving business environment and competition to boost the level and
efficiency of domestic and foreign investment and enhance economic productivity and
diversification, all prerequisites to generate higher growth and more quality jobs.



                                             37
118. Implementation of key and sensitive reforms may not be continued under the PAMT
2013-2016. The proposed operation is clearly aligned with the Government’s priorities, so it
is expected that the reforms it supports will be implemented as planned. That said, the
transition has already resulted in a slowing down in pre-school education. The Bank team will
continue to engage the Government in a close dialogue on these reforms, and to support
decision making through technical assistance when important technical issues arise.

119. The reform program faces resistance from unions, including teacher resistance to the
efficiency measures and the move toward greater accountability. The Government will
continue to engage in a broad dialogue with teacher unions and teachers, with a view to
creating a buy-in to the reform program through participation and decision-making.

120. Attainment of the ambitious objectives of the Government’s program may be
constrained unless sufficient resources are made available. Education has been a national
priority for successive government and this level of political commitment is expected to
continue.

121. Implementation of the governmental program may be constrained by the capacity of
decentralized agencies. The MEN is making considerable efforts to strengthen the capacity of
its management systems.

1. Contexte general

A mi-parcours et apres l'achevement du programme d'urgence (PU), des evaluations ont ete

effectuees afin de consolider les acquis et de determiner les actions prioritaires dans les domaines

necessitant un effort d'amelioration.


Dans ce cadre, il convient de citer, en plus de I' evaluation effectuee de maniere periodique dans le

cadre des missions conjointes des bailleurs de fonds et des missions de !'inspection generale des

finances, deux evaluations importantes qui sont aujourd'hui finalisees, il s'agit de (i) l'audit

technique      a mi-parcours du PU, pris en charge par un cabinet externe et dont le rapport final a ete
adresse et presente aux partenaires techniques et financiers fin aout 2012 ainsi que (ii)

I' evaluation realisee par !'inspection generale du Ministere et dont les resultats ont ete presentes
                                                                                 1
lors de Ia session des conseils d'administration des AREF de juin-juillet 2012 et devant Ia

commission de l'enseignement du Parlement Marocain le mardi 24 juillet 2012.

Les principales conclusions de ces differentes evaluations

./ Les acquis :

           ~   Une nette avancee dans le niveau de couverture essentiellement en termes de (i)

               developpement de l'offre scolaire pour les trois cycles primaire, collegial et qualifiant.

               Plus de 800 etablissements scolaires, tous cycles confondus, ont ete crees entre 2007-

               2008    et   2011-2012      avec    !'implementation             du   nouveau       concept    des   ecoles

               communautaires en milieu rural ; de (ii) de Ia mise                      a niveau      des etablissements

               scolaires deja disponibles (rehabilitations, renouvellement des equipements et

               raccordement aux reseaux eau potable            I    electricite) ; de (iii) Ia mise en place d'un

               programme global et integre d'appui social structure autour de 4 composantes

               (« Initiative Royale un Million de Cartables », programme de soutien financier direct,

               cantines scolaires, internats et transport scolaire) ayant permis une generalisation des

               prestations aux eleves issus du milieu rural et des zones urbaines et periurbaines

               defavorisees.
           ~   Une amelioration continuelle des indicateurs de scolarisation et d'achevement des

               cycles. II a ete meme permis de noter une revision                    a Ia   baisse des taux d'abandon

               scolaire notamment au primaire, tendance qui est de nature                    a s'accentuer.

En s'inscrivant dans cette approche d'evaluation, le Ministere vient d'elaborer et de valider son

plan d'action   a moyen terme (PAMT 2013-2016).
Dans ce contexte, Ia presente note de politique sectorielle se propose de decliner les grandes

lignes du PAMT 2013-2016. En matiere de methodologie, trois principes directeurs ont ete

retenus dans I' elaboration en relations avec I' experience du PU et des enseignements tires durant

Ia periode de sa mise en ceuvre :

    ../ La continuite   a travers Ia consolidation     des acquis du programme d'urgence et Ia prise en

       compte des enseignements, des difficultes rencontrees et des detis qui restent                            a relever. La
       continuite aussi dans Ia consolidation de Ia demarche projet mise en place, Ia dynamique

       des equipes chargees de mettre en ceuvre les differents projets du PU et Ia valorisation des

       competences et des experiences des cadres et managers du MEN sur les trois paliers

       central, regional et provincial.

              educatif et Ia diversite des acteurs internes et externes et de leurs attentes, il est acquis a

              travers les enseignements du PU, que Ia meilleure demarche est d'hierarchiser les objectifs

              et de cibler sur un plan politique les priorites des dont celles liees aux besoins et

              insuffisances des etablissements scolaires, le suivi et I' amelioration des apprentissages des

             impacts cibles au niveau de l'etablissement scolaire et vis-a-vis des acteurs locaux. La

             problematique qu'il convient de prendre en charge avec succes, est d'ameliorer Ia

             coordination et Ia convergence entre les niveaux central et regional avec les structures

             locales et etablissements scolaires. Les dispositifs d'implication et de dialogue avec les

             acteurs locaux et de rentabilisation des ressources budgetaires qui leurs sont consacrees,

             meritent d'etre revue et optimise.

     2. Choix prioritaires I du PAMT 2013-2016
     Ces choix ont ete guides tout d'abord par les hautes orientations de Sa Majeste le Roi Mohamed

     VI, soulignees dans son discours du 20 aout 2012, a !'occasion de l'anniversaire de Ia revolution du

     Roi et du peuple.

     Les choix prioritaires du Ministere s'appuient egalement sur les orientations retenues dans le

     programme gouvernemental 2012-2016, celui-ci a consacre Ia place predominante du secteur de

     !'education et Ia formation en le situant en tant que grand pari pour le developpement du pays,

     c'est pourquoi il constitue une priorite majeure dans le programme social du gouvern ement, et

     dont le volet de l'enseignement est base sur un principe directeur qui consiste a retablir Ia

     confiance dans l'ecole publique et sur trois axes strategiques:

          ../ Axel : Positionnement de l'etablissement scolaire au cceur de !'interet accorde au systeme

             educatif en lui octroyant une autorite effective dans Ia prise de decision et une autonomie

             active en matiere de gestion, tout en mettant a sa disposition les moyens necessaires et les

             competences adequates pour s'acquitter de ses missions et roles educatifs. Ce qui permet

             aux cadres pedagogiques et administratifs des etres engages, mobilises et responsables

Les choix prioritaires du Ministere, sur Ia base des hautes orientations de Sa Majeste le Roi et des

lignes directrices du Plan Gouvernemental 2012-2016, se declinent com me suit:

    v' Premier choix: Appui         a Ia   scolarisation en donnant Ia priorite          a l'equite           et   a l'egalite   des

       chances,    a travers     !'adoption d'une approche de reduction des disparites prenant en

       compte les specificites et les attentes des populations locales, en accordant une

       importance particuliere a Ia fille en milieu rural et aux enfants                      a besoins        specifiques, en

       concentrant les efforts sur les zones enclavees et difficiles et en reduisant les effets des

       facteurs socioeconomiques et geographiques.

    v' Second choix: Amelioration de Ia qualite des apprentissages, en mettant le focus sur Ia

       formation initiale et continue des enseignants, !'approche pedagogique de l'enseignement

       et le dispositif de !'evaluation des apprentissages, le suivi individuel des eleves en

       coherence avec le soutien pedagogique qui leur est dedie.

    v' Troisieme choix : Developpement de Ia gouvernance du systeme educatif, a travers

       !'amelioration des capacites, de l'efficacite et de l'efficience du systeme en matiere de

       gestion institutionnelle, administrative et financiere, et ce dans le cadre du processus de

       mise en place de Ia regionalisation avancee. Une priorite particuliere sera accordee aux

       etablissements scolaires notamment au developpement de leur autonomie de gestion, au

       renforcement de leurs capacites et                a leur     niveau de rendement (resultats realises                       I

3. Espaces d'intervention I PAMT 2013-2016

Pour decliner les quatre choix prioritaires, cinq espaces ont ete retenus dans Ia structuration du

PAMT 2013-2016 du M inistere :


Espace 1 : Offre scolaire

Cet espace vise d'une part, !'amelioration du niveau de Ia generalisation de l'enseignement

prescolaire pour Ia tranche d'age 4-5 ans, et de Ia generalisation de l'enseignement primaire et

collegial relatif   a Ia   tranche d'age 6   a 15   ans et d'autre part, l'elargissement de Ia base de

l'enseignement secondaire qualifiant.


Espace 2 : Qualite de l'enseignement
L'objectif de cet espace est d'ameliorer Ia qualite de l'enseignement,      atravers Ia mise en place des
approches d'enseignement, de Ia revision des programmes et des curricula pedagogiques, de

I' evaluation, de I' orientation et du renforcement de l'enseignement des langues.


Espace 3 : Etablissement scolaire
Vu Ia position centrale de l'etablissement scolaire dans le developpement concret du systeme

educatif, comme signale dans le programme gouvernemental, un espace specifique lui a ete

consacre.

Cet espace vise !'adaptation des mesures prioritaires aux besoins et specificites regionales,

provinciales et locales, !'acceleration des procedures de gestion de l'etablissement scolaire et

definition des responsabilites, ceci afin de resoudre les problemes effectifs du systeme au niveau

local et permettre une reelle marge de manceuvre de l'etablissement scolaire en termes educatif,

administratif, financier et sociale.


Espace 4 : Gouvernance
Cet espace vise !'amelioration de Ia gouvernance au ministere pour plus de performance et

d'efficacite dans I' optimisation des ressources financieres ainsi que dans Ia maitrise des dispositifs

de gestion institutionnelle de !' administration centrale, des academies regionales et des

delegations provinciales, et ce dans le cadre de Ia mise en ceuvre de Ia regionalisation avancee.


Espace 5 : Ressources humaines

    La realisation de Ia reforme reste liee de maniere particuliere a l'efficacite des ressources

    humaines, a leur performance, a leur engagement eta leur adhesion a Ia mission educative.

    Cet espace a pour objectif le deploiement d'un ensemble de mesures operationnelles qui se
    resument com me suit :

            Elaboration et mise en ceuvre d'une strategie globale pour Ia gestion des ressources

            humaines au niveau central, regional, provincial et local, dans laquelle seront integrees en

4. Positionnement des mesures d'appui BM- PPDE2 I JICA- BESSP I PAMT 2013-
2016

La politique du Ministere en matiere de mise en place de conventions de partenariat avec les

bailleurs de fonds (PTF2), est claire. Tout en confirmant !'interet qu'accorde le Royaume du Maroc

aux relations de cooperation internationale, il s'agit de federer !'ensemble des initiatives et

mesures d'appui auteur de Ia strategie du Ministere et des priorites du secteur educatif. Notre

priorite aujourd'hui est que le dispositif de choix des mesures d'appui, de suivi et d'evaluation de

leur mise en ceuvre et avancement de maniere conjointe avec les PTF 2, soit implemente dans un

cadre coherent et collectif et avec une seule plateforme d'indicateurs de suivi.


En attendant le lancement et Ia finalisation de I' etude financee par Ia DUE et qui est pilotee par les

services du Ministere, cette etude permettra d'evaluer tous les composants du dispositif de

suivi/evaluation des PTF et de proposer les recommandations appropriees, le Ministere est

engage, en ce moment avec Ia fin de Ia periode du PU, dans une serie de discussions continues

avec I' ensemble des PTF en vue d'une part, de voir leur point de vue sur les pistes d'amelioration

dudit dispositif et d'autre part, de preparer les prochaines plateformes de mesures d'appui au

secteur.




Dans ce cadre, les services du Ministere viennent d'achever une premiere mission de formulation

des mesures d'appui au secteur educatif avec Ia BM et Ia JICA durant Ia periode 26-29 novembre

                                                                          4

l'avancement des huit mesures de Ia BM.


II importe de souligner que Ia consistance des deux plans d' appui issus respectivement du PPDE2

et du BESSP est veritablement en bonne coherence avec Ia logique directrice du PAMT 2013-2016,

les mesures et le programme des deux plans sont orientes vers les priorites du secteur et les

problemes poses en ce moment avec acuite.


S'agissant du programme d'investissement propose dans le plan BESSP de Ia JICA, il concerne le

financement et le pilotage de Ia construction d'un ensemble de colleges avec internats en milieu

rural. Ce programme constitue pour le Royaume du Maroc une opportunite de taille pour faire

accelerer le niveau de couverture du milieu rural en colleges et rattraper le retard, accuse durant

les deux dernieres decennies, en matiere de generalisation de Ia scolarisation pour Ia population

12-14 ans malgre le progres interessant realise avec le PU, sachant que pour celle de 06-11 ans, le

Maroc est sur Ia bonne voie de generalisation . II convient de preciser que Ia demarche de choix de

ces colleges est basee sur un ensemble de criteres permettant de s'assurer que les colleges seront

crees dans les communes rurales ayant un deficit critique en scolarisation et un abandon scolaire.


Pour les quatre {4) mesures de l'appui budgetaire de Ia JICA, elles visent l'appui de I' education de

base en matiere de qualite des apprentissages au niveau de Ia classe. C'est dans ce sens, que Ia

substance et !'esprit de ces mesures touchent les leviers determinants de cette qualite, en

precisant que ce volet reste parmi les defis                      arelever apres Ia fin du PU. II s'agit ainsi de :

             Mesure JICAl : Renforcement et amelioration des mecanismes de suivi individuel des

             eleves et Ia maitrise du dispositif de correlation de ces mecanismes avec l'efficacite des

             accompagnement              a ce   processus important qui s'inscrit dans le cadre du programme

             PAGESMS' en partenariat avec I'ACDI6 6 , le plan de Ia formation des directeurs des

             etablissements dans le cadre des projets d' etablissements, est egalement parmi les

             pedagogiques et techniques de Ia mise en place operationnelle des centres regionaux des

            metiers de !'education et de Ia formation (CRMEF). Cette mise en place constitue

            aujourd'hui un processus de maturation de Ia reforme de Ia formation initiale dans le

            cadre du PU, un levier majeur du PAMT 2013-2016 qui mise en priorite sur !'amelioration

            des apprentissages. Outre les benefices qui seront tires de ces nouveaux centres regionaux

            dans le cadre du nouveau dispositif de management de Ia formation continue des

            enseignants.

            Mesure JICA4 : Motivation des parents/membres de Ia communaute pour inscrire et

            maintenir leurs enfants             a !'ecole     en ce qui concerne !'education de base (primaire et

            secondaire). La finalite escomptee de cette mesure est de booster Ia demarche et les

            activites de mobilisation des acteurs locaux autour de Ia question de Ia scolarisation

            inclusive des eleves pour le primaire mais surtout pour le collegial, sachant que les

            difficu ltes sont plus intenses dans les zones rurales et periurbaines vivant en situation

            socio-economique difficile.


Pour les huit (8) mesures de l'appui budgetaire de Ia BM, elles viennent en appui financier et

1. General Context

The Emergency Education Program (PUEN), at its mid-term and after its completion, was
evaluated with the aim of consolidating positive impacts and determining the priority actions
that require improvement.

In this regard, in addition to the periodic evaluations conducted in the context of joint
missions of the donors and the Office of the Auditor-General, mention should be made of two
important evaluations that have now been completed: (i) the mid-term technical audit of the
PUEN, responsibility for which was assigned to an external firm with the final report being
submitted to the technical and financial partners at end-August 2012; and (ii) the evaluation
done by the Office of the Inspector-General of the Ministry of Education, the findings of
which were presented at the June-July 2012 AREF Board meeting and to the education
commission of the Moroccan Parliament on Tuesday, July 24, 2012.

Main Conclusions of These Different Evaluations

       Progress:

        Clear progress with the level of coverage largely in terms of: (i) developing
educational services for the three grade levels—primary, lower secondary, and upper
secondary. More than 800 schools (all grade levels) were established between 2007 and 2008
and 2011 and 2012 with (i) the implementation of the new concept of community-based
schools in rural areas ; (ii) the upgrading of existing schools (rehabilitation, repair of
equipment, and connection to potable water/electricity networks); and (iii) the establishment
of a global and integrated support structure program built around four components (the “one
million schoolbags? royal initiative, the direct financial assistance program, school cafeterias,
boarding facilities, and school transport), which have made it possible to provide
comprehensive services to students from rural areas and disadvantaged urban and semi-rural
zones.
        A steady improvement in education and grade completion indicators, and the first ever
reduction in school dropout rates, particularly at the primary level, which is now on track to
achieving universal status. Steady progress with these indicators for the lower secondary and
upper secondary levels, both in global terms and for girls from rural areas, despite the fact that
the situation with respect to these two levels and in this category remains unsatisfactory,
notwithstanding all the work done in the PUEN context.

                                               51
         Qualitative improvements in the basic training system. A series of legal and
organizational measures have been adopted and have facilitated the establishment, beginning
in the 2012-2013 school year, of regional education and training centers for teachers. This
initiative was supported by a new system for providing basic training to teachers for the pre-
school level and the primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary levels.
         The institutional and financial areas of the governance system have also improved, as
evidenced by (i) the application of the project-based approach to PUEN implementation and
capacity building of central, regional, and provincial teams; (ii) the resumption of regular
meetings of AREF Boards ; (iii) the negotiation and allocation of budgetary resources to
AREFs using a results-based approach, via medium-term regional and provincial action plans;
(iv) the establishment of internal audit units within the AREFs; and (v) the start of the process
of establishing a general accounting system and budget information system in AREFs.
         Gaining a full understanding of the school mapping planning process, as well as
making projections, based on an integrated approach involving the planning entities, human
resources, social support, construction, and information systems. The progress made in
optimizing the school mapping cycle and human resource mobility should be emphasized.
This has resulted in a clear improvement in optimization ratios and the equitable deployment
of human resources in AREFs and provincial education offices.

       Challenges still to be addressed: Despite this progress, difficulties persist and
considerable work must be done during the 2013-2016 period.

        Significant challenges in achieving universal education and resolving retention and
dropout issues (i) in the case of a small group of children at the primary level (it is difficult to
serve them effectively and efficiently owing to their specific situation); (ii) school-age
children between the ages of 12 and 17 and in particular girls in rural areas where
sociocultural issues have proven too complex and difficult to tackle by the Ministry of
Education only.
        Pre-school education, despite the achievements of the PUEN, in particular in the area
of integrated classrooms in public primary schools, is facing a number of problems linked to
the policy to be adopted for its development and application.
        Difficulties focusing efforts and resources on pedagogical priorities, the expected
benefits of which are largely in the area of better quality instruction for students,
notwithstanding the importance of building and upgrading new facilities and providing social
support.
        Difficulties in the pedagogical sphere related to (i) improving the effectiveness and
efficiency of continuing education with a focus on quality; and (ii) grade repetition and
establishment of an effective mechanism for monitoring individual students and
synchronizing this mechanism with the pedagogical support mechanism for students.
        Need for ongoing improvement of the capacity and skills of pedagogical,
administrative, and management staff.
        Need to complete the contracting process with the AREFs and the provincial bodies in
a coherent framework based on the advanced regionalization approach being adopted.

Using this approach to evaluation, the Ministry recently drafted and validated its Education
Action Plan 2013-2016 (PAMT).

Against this backdrop, this sector policy note seeks to set forth the general outline of this
plan. From a methodological standpoint, three guiding principles have been used in its
                                                52
preparation based on PUEN experience and lessons learned during its 2009-2012
implementation period:
          Continuity, by building on the gains of the Emergency Program and drawing on
lessons learned, problems encountered, and challenges that are still to be addressed.
Continuity also with the project-approach adopted, relations among the teams responsible for
implementing the different PUEN projects, and development of the skills and experience of
senior staff and managers in the Ministry of Education at the central, regional, and provincial
levels.
        Prioritization aimed at focusing the efforts of the Ministry and budget and human
resources on the priorities identified, based on tangible and verifiable facts and observations.
In view of the complexity of the problems, the sheer size of the education system, and the
diverse mix of internal and external actors and their expectations, some of the lessons learned
from the PUEN are that it is best not to work on too many projects at the same time and that it
is truly beneficial, in the medium and long term, for the Ministry to prioritize objectives and
focus key priorities on a policy plan. These priorities are linked to the needs of and shortages
in schools, the monitoring and improvement of learning outcomes, and continuing and basic
training for teachers using an effective and efficient approach that tangibly enhances the
quality of instruction.
Consistency, by fostering greater convergence between implemented activities and targeted
impacts in terms of schools and vis-à-vis local actors. Improved coordination and
convergence between the central and regional levels with local entities and schools is the
main problem that needs to be successfully tackled. The mechanisms for involvement and
dialogue with local actors and the benefits derived from the budgetary resources allocated to
them require review and optimization.

2. Priority Actions / PAMT 2013-2016
These actions were guided, first and foremost, by the royal directives of His Majesty King
Mohamed VI that were outlined in his speech of August 20, 2012 delivered on the occasion
of the anniversary of the Revolution of the King and the People.

The Ministry’s priority actions also draw on the policies set forth in the Government’s 2012-
2016 program, which has made education and training the predominant sector by according it
a central role in the country’s development. For this reason, it is a top priority in the
Government’s social program, which has an education component that is based on a guiding
principle, which seeks to restore confidence in public schools, and on three strategic
areas:
         Area No. 1: Positioning of schools as an integral component of the focus on the
education system by granting them effective decision-making authority and managerial
autonomy, while equipping them with the resources and appropriate skills needed to fulfill their
roles and responsibilities in the field of education. This will allow teaching and administrative
staff to be engaged, mobilized, and accountable for outcomes;
         Area No. 2: Governance of the education sector by mobilizing and optimizing human
and physical resources, and by adopting a system of governance based on the principle of
planning and precise programming, while implementing clear objectives and timelines for
achievements, creating an evaluation-based culture, and introducing monitoring and
management tools;
         Area No. 3: Development of the roles and responsibilities of the nation’s schools by
reviewing the quality of the curricula and learning approaches, teaching practices, and the

                                              53
ways in which schools are organized and operated, and by adopting a comprehensive
approach based on a series of learner-focused activities.

The Ministry’s priority actions, which are based on the King’s royal directives and the
policies set forth in the Government’s 2012-2016 Plan, are as follows:
        Action No. 1: Supporting enrollment efforts by according priority to equity and equal
opportunity through the adoption of an approach aimed at reducing disparities, taking the
specificities and expectations of the local populations into account, by paying particular
attention to rural girls and special needs children, by targeting landlocked and remote areas,
and by mitigating the effects of socioeconomic and geographical factors.
        Action No. 2: Enhancing the quality of instruction by focusing on basic and continuing
teacher training, the pedagogical approach to teaching and the student learning assessment
system, and individual student monitoring in line with the pedagogical support provided to
students.
        Action No. 3: Developing governance of the education system, by enhancing the
capacities, effectiveness, and efficiency of the system with respect to institutional,
administrative, and financial management, as part of the effort to implement the advanced
regionalization process. Special priority will be given to schools, specifically to developing
their managerial autonomy, building their capacities, and boosting their levels of achievement
(student outcomes/allocated resources).
        Action No. 4: Ensuring the efficient management and optimization of human
resources through the smooth execution of the process to transfer human resource
management to the AREFs, as part of the effort to implement the advanced regionalization
process, and through an effective skills and capacity-building policy for staff and managers.

3. Pillars of intervention/PAMT 2013-2016

In order to present the four priority actions, five pillars were established for the preparation
of the Ministry’s PAMT for 2013-2016:

Pillar No. 1: Access to education
This pillar seeks to expand universal access to preschool education for the 4-5 year old cohort
and to primary and lower secondary education for the 6-15 year old cohort on one hand, and
broaden the upper secondary education base, on the other.

Pillar No. 2: Quality of education
This pillar aims to improve education quality, by implementing teaching approaches,
revamping syllabi and education curricula, conducting assessments, establishing policies, and
strengthening language teaching.

Pillar No. 3: Schools
A specific pillar has been assigned to schools, given their central role in the targeted
development of the education system, as indicated in the Government’s program. This pillar
seeks to tailor priority measures to regional, provincial, and local needs and specificities,
expedite management procedures for schools, and define their responsibilities, with a view to
resolving current problems facing the system at the local level and giving real flexibility to
schools to address educational, administrative, financial, and social issues.



                                              54
Pillar No. 4: Governance
This pillar is aimed at improving governance in the Ministry with a view to enhanced
performance and efficiency in the optimization of financial resources and mastery of the
institutional management mechanisms for the central government, regional academies, and
provincial offices, as part of the process to implement advanced regionalization, as adopted
by the new constitution.

Pillar No. 5: Human resources
Implementation of the reform is tied specifically to the effectiveness of human resources; to
their performance, commitment, and buy-in to the education mission. This pillar seeks to
implement a series of operational measures:
        Development and implementation of a comprehensive human resource management
strategy at the central, regional, provincial, and local levels, which will include, in particular,
the methods for transferring human resource management to the AREFs; and
        Completion of the introduction of the human resource management information
system.

4. Context of support measures: World Bank - EDPL2/ JICA - BESSP/PAMT 2013-
2016

The Ministry’s policy regarding the implementation of partnership agreements with donors
(TFPs) is clear. While confirming the importance that the Kingdom of Morocco attaches to
international cooperation relations, it seeks to align all the support measures and
initiatives with the Ministry’s strategy and the education sector’s priorities. Our
immediate priority is to ensure that the mechanism for selecting support measures and
monitoring and evaluating their implementation and progress in conjunction with the
TFPs is implemented in a coherent and collective framework, using a single platform of
monitoring indicators.

Pending the launch and completion of the DUE-funded study being spearheaded by the
Ministry’s departments, this study will facilitate assessment of all components of the
technical and financial partners’ monitoring and evaluation mechanism and make appropriate
recommendations. As the PUEN period has ended, the Ministry is currently participating in a
series of ongoing discussions with the TFPs, with a view to hearing their opinions on ways to
improve this mechanism and preparing subsequent platforms for sector support measures.

In this regard, the Ministry’s departments completed the initial task of formulating support
measures for the education sector with the World Bank and JICA between November 26 and
29, 2012. Discussions continued until December 14, 2012 in an effort to also finalize the
“investment? component of the JICA support plan.

The World Bank’s support plan, the EDPL2, includes eight measures to be financed in the
form of budgetary support, while JICA’s plan, the Basic Education Sector Support Project,
has four measures to be financed in the form of budgetary assistance and the investment
program, with the understanding that JICA has also committed to tracking the progress of
the World Bank’s eight measures.

It is important to point out that the content of the two support plans developed from the
EDPL2 and the BESSP is truly in line with the approach adopted in the PAMT for 2013-
                                                55
2016, as the measures and program in both plans are geared toward the sector’s priorities and
the current pressing challenges.

The investment program proposed in JICA’s BESSP plan involves the financing and
management of the construction of a group of rural lower secondary schools with boarding
facilities. This program is a golden opportunity for the Kingdom of Morocco to expedite
access to lower secondary schools in rural areas and make up for ground lost over the past
two decades with respect to universal access to education for the 12-14 year old age group,
despite significant progress made under the PUEN, and recognizing as well that Morocco is
on track to achieve universal access to education for the 6-11 year old age group. It bears
noting that the approach adopted by these lower secondary schools is based on a set of
criteria aimed at ensuring that lower secondary schools will be established in rural communes
that have critically low enrollment, dropout, and completion rates.

JICA’s four budgetary support measures aim to support basic education in the area of
quality of classroom instruction. Accordingly, the substance and spirit of these measures
focus on the factors that assess this quality, while clarifying that this component is one of the
challenges that remain following completion of the PUEN. The objectives of the measures
are as follows:
        JICA Measure No. 1: Strengthening and improvement of the individual student
monitoring mechanisms and mastery of the system that synchronizes these mechanisms with
efficient pedagogical support procedures.
        JICA Measure No. 2: Effective implementation of the new “development plan?
strategy and the new criteria grid for the approval, programming, execution, and monitoring
and evaluation of development plans. Supporting this important process that is part of the
Moroccan School Management Support Program (PAGESM) in partnership with the Canadian
International Development Agency, is the training plan for the principals of the schools in the
context of the development plans, which is also included in the indicators to be monitored.
        JICA Measure No. 3:             Development and formalization of organizational,
pedagogical, and technical procedures for the operational establishment of Regional Teacher
Training Centers (CRMEFs). The establishment of these centers is the culmination of the
reform of basic training under the PUEN, a key component of the PAMT 2013-2016, which
accords priority to improving student learning, in addition to the benefits that will be derived
from these new regional centers in the context of the new mechanism for managing
continuing education for teachers.
        JICA Measure No. 4: Motivation of parents/community members to enroll and keep
their children in school at the basic education level (primary and secondary). This measure is
intended to boost the approach and activities in order to rally local actors around the issue of
inclusive student enrollment at the primary level, and in particular at the lower secondary
level, recognizing that the challenges are more formidable in rural and semi-rural
communities living in a harsh socioeconomic environment.

The World Bank’s eight budgetary support measures provide financial and technical
support for the achievement and realization of the objectives of the five pillars of the
Ministry’s new PAMT 2013-2016. These five pillars are (i) access to education: this will be
ensured through the two measures relating to the effective and optimal location of schools
(EDPL2.1) and management of the implementation of the social support program (EDPL2.2);
(ii) the quality of education through two measures: management of the evaluation activities
(EDPL2.3) and the implementation of the new reference guide for basic training (EDPL2.4);
                                              56
(iii) schools, through the measure relating to the evaluation of the development plan
mechanism (analyses/lessons learned and methods for improvements) (EDPL2.7); (iv)
governance through the measure to establish internal audit units within the AREFs, with
rigorous monitoring with respect to regulation of adopted profiles, work schedules, and
monitoring of their responsibilities (EDPL2.8); (v) human resources through two measures:
the development of the mechanism for optimizing the mobility and development of human
resources (EDPL2.5) and gradual implementation of the decentralization policy by initiating
the transfer of human resource management to the AREFs (EDPL2.6). The objectives of the
eight measures are as follows:

         EDPL2.1: Introduction of new criteria for the establishment of primary and lower
secondary schools, according priority to rural and semi-rural areas.
         EDPL2.2: Implementation of a comprehensive action plan that provides for the
consolidation and integration of social support programs – the “one million schoolbags? royal
initiative, boarding facilities/cafeteria, school transport, and cash transfers conditional on
regular school attendance.
         EDPL2.3: Execution of student learning assessments at the regional level, in
collaboration with the AREFs.
         EDPL2.4: Implementation of the basic training reference guide for teachers
(preschool/primary, lower secondary, upper secondary).
         EDPL2.5: Development of a mechanism for optimizing the redeployment, mobility,
and stability of educational human resources.
         EDPL2.6: Transfer to the AREFs of human resource management functions not
subject to regular oversight by the Ministry of Economy and Finance.
         EDPL2.7: Quantitative and qualitative assessment of the implementation of the
development plan mechanism and its financing.
         EDPL2.8: Establishment of internal audit units, together with their work schedules,
in the 16 AREFs.

     IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
                               Morocco

On February 1, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Morocco.60

Background

Morocco has a track record of strong macroeconomic policies that, over the last decade,
contributed to solid growth, low inflation, comfortable external reserves, financial deepening,
and poverty reduction. These favorable developments have helped Morocco cushion the impact
of the international crisis and respond to pressing social needs. In the context of political
transitions in many countries in the region and high social demands, a new constitution was
adopted in July 2011 in order to pave the way for broad-ranging political changes and reforms,
including strengthened roles for the head of government and Parliament. Morocco’s positive
record helped it qualify last August for a 24-month arrangement under the Precautionary and
Liquidity Line (PLL), which aims to provide insurance against external shocks. More recently,
this performance has been challenged by a deteriorating external environment and, in 2012,
poor rainfall. Growth is expected to slow in 2012 to 3.2 percent, largely due to a lower-than-
average cereal crop, but nonagricultural GDP growth is projected to remain robust at around 4.5
percent. Headline inflation has remained subdued at 1.6 percent (year-on-year) in November
2012, despite significant increases in the prices of several subsidized energy products in June,
as part of the government’s effort to contain the fiscal cost of subsidies. Core inflation (excluding
food and transport) was close to zero due to the large negative contribution of lower

  Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

communication tariffs. Despite relatively strong growth, unemployment has remained around 9
percent since 2010.

The fiscal deficit should decline to about 6 percent of GDP in 2012, thanks to a combination of
measures notably the increase in some energy-administered prices in June and the control
of nonessential spending. Delays in the adoption of the 2012 budget and in disbursement of
external grants resulted in lower-than-projected investment. This, in turn, helped offset the
subsidy bill that reached about 6.2 percent of GDP. The 2013 budget envisions a further
reduction of the deficit by 1.4 percent point of GDP to 4.7 percent of GDP. For the medium term,
the authorities aim at a deficit below 3 percent of GDP.

The current account deficit is expected to increase to 8.8 percent of GDP in 2012 as import
growth, pushed by energy-related imports, outpaced slow export growth. Tourism receipts and
remittances are projected to fall slightly relative to 2011, reflecting the deterioration in the
European economy. While gross international reserves (GIR) fell steadily in 2011 and most of
2012, they stabilized at around four months of imports in the last quarter. The issuance of a
US$1.5 billion sovereign bond at favorable terms in late 2012 provided additional support in this
regard.

Monetary conditions have remained broadly supportive. Lower international reserves had a
substantial restrictive impact on bank liquidity, contributing to slowing credit growth to 7 percent
in 2012. To help fill the liquidity shortage, the central bank stepped up its liquidity injection,
including by extending eligible collateral for its repo. The policy interest rate was cut by
0.25 percentage point to 3 percent in March 2012 and has remained unchanged since then. In
September 2012, it also cut its reserve requirements for banks by 2 percentage points to 4
percent.

Morocco’s social indicators have improved over the past decade. Higher economic growth,
lower unemployment, better health and educational outcomes, better access to basic
infrastructure, and a marked reduction in poverty rates are tangible evidence of the progress
made in fostering inclusive growth. However, unemployment remains high particularly among
the youth. The authorities’ reform agenda includes measures to boost potential growth, tackle
inequalities in the distribution of income and access to health care, particularly across regions
as well as reduce unemployment.

Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors commended the authorities for their overall sound macroeconomic policies,
which, over the past decade, have helped deliver solid growth, low inflation, and poverty
reduction despite continued high youth unemployment. This strong performance has been
challenged recently by external and domestic shocks in a context of pressing social demands.
Directors agreed that the authorities’ program of fiscal consolidation, prudent monetary and
financial policies, and structural reforms to boost competitiveness and inclusive growth and




                                                 70
rebuild shock buffers is appropriate to deal with these challenges. They emphasized that the
outlook hinges on the timely and sustained implementation of the reform agenda.

Directors welcomed the fiscal consolidation envisioned in the 2013 budget and beyond to help
maintain external and fiscal sustainability, while emphasizing that consolidation should be as
growth-friendly as possible. They welcomed the steps being taken toward reforming the subsidy
system, and called on the authorities to move ahead resolutely in this area to aid medium-term
fiscal adjustment and better assist the most vulnerable groups of the population. Directors also
stressed the importance of moving ahead with pension reform to ensure the system’s viability.
They encouraged a careful approach to fiscal decentralization so as not to increase fiscal risks.
They welcomed plans to lower the ratio of the government wage bill to GDP and accelerate tax
reforms. Directors concurred that clear communications and high-quality social dialogue will be
key to successful implementation of the fiscal reform agenda.

Directors considered the current monetary policy stance to be appropriate. They encouraged
the authorities to move toward greater exchange rate flexibility to enhance external
competitiveness and the economy’s ability to absorb shocks, in coordination with other
macroeconomic and structural policies.

Directors called for stepped-up efforts to foster higher and more inclusive growth, including by
boosting youth employment and reducing inequalities in income and in access to health care
and education. They underscored the importance of structural reforms to enhance external
competitiveness and diversify the export base. They welcomed planned reforms to improve the
business climate and promote small and medium-sized enterprises, both crucial to accelerate
private-sector-led growth.

Directors noted that the financial sector remains sound overall. They commended the
authorities’ efforts to further strengthen financial regulation and supervision, particularly in light
of increasing international exposure of Moroccan banks. In this regard, they welcomed the
authorities’ interest in an Financial Sector Assessment Program update. Directors encouraged
the authorities to strengthen legislation against money laundering and terrorism financing, and
to intensify reforms to promote financial development and deepening.

Directors agreed that Morocco continues to meet the qualification criteria for a Precautionary
and Liquidity Line (PLL) arrangement. They noted that the arrangement provides useful
insurance against exogenous shocks and that the program supported by the PLL is on track.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to continue to treat the PLL as precautionary.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's

 ANNEX 5.1: MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS OVER THE LAST DECADE

Morocco made significant economic headways during the last decade. Growth pattern shifted to a
higher level, averaging 4.9 percent over 2001-2011, much higher than the average rate of the 1990s
(2.8 percent). Inflation was subdued, recording less than 2 percent on average over the period. The
growth and inflation performance allowed gross domestic product (GDP) per capita to almost double
over the last decade to reach the equivalent of US$3,100 in 2011. The unemployment rate declined
from 12.3 percent in 2000 to 8.9 percent in 2011. Absolute poverty decreased from 15.3 percent to
roughly 9 percent between 2001 and 2007. Based on these achievements, Morocco gained “investment
grade? rating in 2007, which was confirmed over 2009-2011 despite ongoing world economic turmoil.

These achievements were in part the result of sound macroeconomic policies. The steady
consolidation of public finance turned fiscal deficits61 into surpluses in 2007 and 2008 (averaging 0.3
percent of GDP). The fiscal deficits widened to 2.2 percent of GDP in 2009 and 4.7 percent of GDP in
2010 but remained manageable. The Treasury total debt steadily declined from 68 percent of GDP in
2000 to 50.3 percent of GDP in 2010. Monetary policy sought to keep inflation under check while
managing both liquidity and the exchange rate in an effective manner. In addition to timely
adjustments of its money policy rate and reserve requirement rate, the Central Bank (BAM)
implemented an adequate mix of its other instruments, including foreign exchange swaps, issuance or
buyback of debt securities, and the purchase or sale of securities in the secondary market.

Morocco’s economic improvement was also due to the implementation of ambitious structural
reforms. During the last decade, Morocco liberalized a number of sectors, including transport, energy,
and telecommunications. The financial sector was strengthened in support of the new dynamism of the
nonagricultural sector. Ambitious sector-specific strategies were implemented to increase investment
and employment opportunities. Gross investment, which used to hover around 25 percent of GDP on
average in the 1990s, picked up in the 2000s to reach 38 percent of GDP in 2008 (Figure 1). Morocco
also sought to deepen its integration into the world economy through the signing of many free-trade
agreements culminating with the “Advanced Status? awarded by the EU in 2008. FDI inflows
increased to reach an average of 4.4 percent of GDP over 2006-11, thus contributing to the expansion
of the country’s stock of capital.

Notwithstanding those economic achievements, Morocco remains confronted with important human
and social challenges. Morocco’s social and human development outcomes are still below
expectations. Economic vulnerability (poor and vulnerable) remains widespread, meaning that a
quarter of the population–around 8 million people–is either in absolute poverty or under constant
threat of falling back into poverty. The partial closure of the rural-urban income gap has not cancelled
disparities: 70 percent of poverty in Morocco is still rural and in 2007 the urban poverty rate was 4.8
percent compared to 14.5 percent in rural areas. Income of the poor has been growing at a slower rate
than the average income. There has been a remarkable increase in access to education, but overall
illiteracy rates and gender disparity in access to secondary education remain high. Both education
quality and learning outcomes lag behind those of other countries with similar income levels. Even
with progress in increasing overall life expectancy and reducing average infant mortality rate, levels of
infant and maternal mortality remain high, and lag MDG targets.

Morocco’s ongoing human and social challenges reflect the slow structural transformation of the
economy. To be sure, Morocco’s production structure has gradually shifted toward services with both
primary and secondary sectors’ shares in GDP declining over time. However, while the increased
service orientation of the economy is emulating trends observed throughout the world, the weak
performance of the manufacturing sector stems from the relatively slow modernization of the
industrial sector, which also explains the performance of Moroccan exports. The latter continue to be
concentrated around relatively undiversified, low knowledge, low value-added, traditional products.
As a result, Morocco has not fully reaped the benefits from the market access opportunities and trade
dynamics of its trading partners. Exports have been kept below potential and their contribution to
growth and employment has yet to be unleashed.

Morocco’s slow structural transformation seems to be less due to the lack of investment than the low
return on investment. Investment in Morocco appears to be less productive than in other emerging
economies. Public investments are concentrated in relatively low-productivity projects or in projects
that need time to fully mature. Indeed, a large share of public investments made in recent years has
been directed to the tourism sector, phosphate related industries, energy, and infrastructure projects
(highways, ports, airports, small dams, free trade zones, etc.). Investments in those sectors require
time to be operational at full capacity and thus profitable. The government has launched analytical
efforts to investigate the issue and propose remedies.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.
