MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF NIGER
FOR A NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed credit
to Niger for SDR 18 million, the equivalent of (US$26.7 million), on standard IDA terms, with a maturity
of 40 years, to help finance the first phase of a long-term program aimed at reversing the current process of
natural resource and environmental degradation, in order to secure sustainable agricultural production and
growth, alleviate poverty, and improve the living conditions of Niger's rural communities.
Country/Sector Background
2.    Niger is a country of about 8 million inhabitants with a per capita GDP that was estimated at
US$300 in 1993. Per capita income has stagnated since 1980, and Niger's fast growing population (3.3
percent annual growth rate) is one of the poorest of the world. At present, 80 percent of the population lives
in rural areas, where food security and nutritional status are dependent on unreliable rainfall. There is a
mounting environmental threat because of deforestation and pressure on land. The social effects of Niger's
economic problems are visible in the urban areas, where population growth and a shrinking modern sector
have led to rising unemployment and social instability. In 1994, the formal sector accounted for 22.7
percent of GDP. It is comprised of a relatively inefficient public sector and a small private sector that is
losing competitiveness. Half of the informal sector, which accounts for 77.3 percent of GDP, is rural. Until
the end of the 1980s, uranium exports amounted to 80 percent of merchandise exports. Between 1990-
1993, they accounted for 71.5 percent of exports and in 1994, 64.8 percent. In 1994, about 40 percent of
GDP came from agriculture; industry and construction contributed 9 percent; and the share of services
stood at 42 percent, of which 10 percent represented Govenmment services.
3.    Niger recently emerged from a protracted period of political turbulence due to the breakdown of the
political coalition goveming the country. The new Government is giving priority to economic and social
reforms that bode well for a revitalization of the reform program, albeit in an atmosphere of fiscal crisis.
Past government adjustment efforts have had variable results, and there have been problems implementing
the post-devaluation program that was agreed upon with the Bank and the IMF'. The country has made
some progress in trade liberalization and in reforming agricultural and educational policies. Less success,
however, has been achieved with the stabilization program (poor revenue mobilization, ballooning wage
bill) and with public enterprise and labor market reforms.
4.    In 1994, the agriculture sector in Niger contributed about 85% of employment, 16% of total export
eamings and 100% of non-uranium export receipts. With the projected continuing decline of the uranium
sector, the agricultural sector is expected to become a major source of foreign exchange. Unfortunately,
however, because Nigerien agriculture is mainly rainfed, its performance has been as erratic as the climate.
The use of inputs such as fertilizers to boost production is too costly and economically risky for the farmer,
1 The government, in close consultation with its CFA franc partners, decided on January 12, 1994, to realign the
parity of the CFA franc from 50 CFA franc per French franc to 100 CFA franc per French franc.



- 2 -
limiting the scope for increasing productivity. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the vagaries of the weather
affected agricultural performance, and available evidence suggests that the prospects for further production
increases from the present low-input-low-output rainfed agriculture are limited.
5.     As a result of the adjustment program (supported by the 1987 Structural Adjustment Credit and
USAID's Agricultural Sector Development Grant), agricultural markets have been liberalized. The cereals
marketing parastatal, OPVN, is no longer involved in commodity stabilization operations, and has become
an emergency, food security, stock management agency. Similarly, subsidies on fertilizers and other
agricultural inputs have been substantially curtailed; prices have been liberalized, and quantitative and
administrative restrictions on trade have been removed. More recently, with the devaluation of the CFA
franc, the Government began to strive to further improve the incentive environment for agriculture by
adopting measures to: (a) pass through the benefits of the devaluation to farmers, and (b) accelerate the
structural reforms necessary to support a supply response.
6.     The natural resources - water, soil and vegetation - that constitute the foundation for all
agricultural production, are rather limited in Niger. A large part of the country (77 percent) is unsuitable
for rainfed agriculture. Natural pastures are being depleted. Fuelwood, which represents the main source of
energy for rural (100 percent) and urban (90 percent) households, is scarce.
7.     Some farmers have reacted to the cyclical droughts by shifting from rainfed fanning of traditional
food crops to irrigated farming of high-value off-season crops. Most farmers have tried to maintain or
increase production by cultivating marginal land or reducing fallow periods; this has caused soil depletion,
loss of fertility, lower yields, and environmental degradation. Lower productivity and declining per capita
incomes are increasing rural poverty and hardship. Caught in this dangerous spiral, rural communities need
to find ways to better manage their land and natural resources or abandon their land and move to urban
centers in which few jobs are available. The proposed Credit will directly support the formulation and
implementation of a long-term National Natural Resources Management Program (NNRMP) for
sustainable agriculture.
8.    In its current development strategy, Niger's principal objective is to achieve equitable sustainable
per capita growth in income. As part of this strategy, in 1992, the Government adopted a Rural
Development Policy Framework (RDPF) that addresses four main areas: (i) natural resource management
(NRM), (ii) food security, (iii) intensification and diversification of production, and (iv) decentralization
and empowerment of rural communities. Land degradation is regarded as the most serious threat to Niger's
development efforts under this strategy. The RDPF advocates an integrated and holistic approach and puts
the community at the center of the decision-making process. One of the objectives of the project is to assist
the Government in further developing its NRM policy and implementing its NNRMP.
The Project
9.    Project Rationale. Poverty, migration and environmental degradation are closely interlinked in
Niger. Rainfall is extremely variable in the country, and it has been declining since 1968; extreme droughts
in 1973-75 and 1984-85 caused mass rural exodus. Surface water resources are scarce, soils are relatively
infertile, and wind and sheet erosion pose additional challenges to agriculture. Only 11% of land resources
can be used for rainfed agriculture. Current fallow periods, reduced to 2.9 years from 7.6 years in 1960,
have become too short to ensure restoration of soil fertility under the traditional, still prevailing, cropping
system. Deforestation leads to permanent loss of about 90,000 ha per year, 3% of the nation's already
degraded forest cover. Once the protection of the tree cover is removed, the fertile top soil is rapidly eroded
away by wind and water. Unorganized use of pastures by increasingly large herds, responding more to



- 3 -
traditional signs of wealth than to a modem production and marketing logic, threatens the land with further
degradation leading to irreversible desertification.
10.   The key to the survival of land as an asset capable of providing sustainable production, a reserve
of agriculture lands for future generations and a shelter for wildlife, is in careful management of the fragile
resource base. The action and investments required for sustainable management are too site-specific, vast
and diffuse to be centralized, organized, implemented, funded and maintained by the Government. Past
centralized efforts to improve environmental management and community development generally failed
because they were sectorally focused, top-down and production-oriented. Today over 80 initiatives in the
West African Region supported by 18 different donors for a total investment of about US$450 million are
demonstrating that the management requirements of a fragile natural resource base can only be met through
the design of local-level resources management and community development plans, and participatory
partnerships with local groups to finance and manage local initiatives. A community-based natural
resources management approach known as gestion terroir is being used. Though it is early to measure the
broad impact of these initiatives, successes can be observed in many countries, especially Burkina Faso and
Mali. The approach has also been tested in Niger where many pilot community-based initiatives have been
implemented with promising results over the last 10 years.
Il.   The design of the proposed project was based upon an extensive examination of alternatives to
ensure that the chosen approach and technologies would succeed with the lowest cost and level of external
support. The project builds on existing experience, and recently approved national policies and strategies to
facilitate the implementation of local development plans that are conceived, co-financed and managed by
the beneficiaries themselves. 111 natural resources management initiatives were examined and assessed
during project preparation. Socio-economic considerations, technologies, institutional issues and
management options were compared. The project will provide the support necessary to catalyze informed
local decision-making, and responsible management of environmental assets and rural development
initiatives. It will also mobilize and enhance the effectiveness of existing specialized technical services in
rural areas, and build cooperative linkages among the many NRM activities underway in Niger. Finally, the
project will help coordinate donor support in the field of rural development. It will be financed by IDA, and
Norway and Denmark through IDA-administered funds.
12.   Project Obiectives. The long-term goal of the NNRMP is to reverse natural resource degradation
in order to achieve sustainable agricultural production and growth, alleviate poverty and improve the living
conditions of Niger's rural communities. The proposed Project constitutes an initial five-year time-slice of a
long-term program, which will last 20-25 years and ultimately reach most of Niger's rural communities.
The Project has two specific objectives: (i) to assist about 380 rural communities in different agro-
ecological zones to design and implement community-based natural resources management plans by
providing them with the necessary skills, information, and technical and financial resources, as well as the
proper institutional and legal framework; and (ii) to improve the Government's capacity to promote, assist
and coordinate current and future NRM initiatives in Niger, and design comprehensive policies and
strategies, within the framework of the NNRMP.
13.   Project Description. The project's principal components are:
(a)    direct technical and financial assistance to communities (US$28. 7m) for the design and
implementation of Community-Based Natural Resources Management (CBNRM) Plans in
about 280 communities in five districts, and assistance through on-going NRM projects in
100 communities;



- 4 -
(b)    provision of services (US$8. Om) to help achieve the Project's objectives, including: human
resource development, national assessment of the state of natural resources, natural
resource information networking, and research and studies; and
(c)   implementation, management and monitoring support (US$4.5m), including institutional
strengthening, monitoring, and assistance to decision-makers in devising national NRM
policies and strategies.
14.    Under component (a), 280 communities will be supported in five of Niger's 31 districts, namely
Boboye, Dogondoutchi, Goure, Say and Tessaoua. These districts cover seven of Niger's thirteen ecological
zones, namely Plateaux, River Valley, Dallols, Goulbis, Eastern Plains, Pastoral, Dunes and Basins. The
seven ecological zones were selected on the basis of their importance as contributors to total national food
production and their relatively large populations. Direct intervention in the zones where there are other on-
going NRM initiatives is not envisaged, as the intent of the program is to create a network of projects
covering most of Niger' and its full range of ecological zones. Assistance, however, will be provided upon
request to selected NRM efforts outside the five districts covered by the project, in order to increase the
number of communities reached and accelerate the implementation of CBNRM program at the national
level. Such support will be in the form of services (information, data, maps, training, surveys and studies)
and investments identified in CBNRM plans, but for which no other financial resources are available. The
Project will provide assistance to another 100 additional communities in this way.
15.    Under Component (b), support will be provided for the following:
(i)    Human Resource Development and Public Awareness: To support the implementation of
the CBNRM approach, a solid training program is essential. Local communities, NNRMP
staff, technical staff from government agencies, district officials and NGOs will benefit
from training to facilitate project activities.
(ii)    Assessment of Natural Resources: Assessment will determine the real extent of natural
resource degradation nationwide, examine its causes, dynamics and trends, and measure its
effects on agricultural production, sustainability, growth, settlement, migration and on the
overall rural economy. This assessment will enable decision-makers and donors to better
define future strategies, and plan and target appropriate interventions.
(iii)   Research and Studies: Research and studies will identify implementation problems and
develop, adapt, test and disseminate technologies to solve those problems.
16.    Under component (c), support will be provided to national NRM policy-making. The information
gathered by the Project staff during implementation, particularly through monitoring, evaluation and
studies, will be used to assist the Government, and, in particular, the national Rural Development Sub-
Committee (RDSC), to improve the national NRM policy that was adopted in 1992. Special studies, issue
papers and reports, will be produced. Assistance will be used to provide support in the drafting of strategy
or policy documents, and the organization of special meetings and workshops.
17.   Project Implementation. This project deals with the broad agriculture sector (crops, livestock,
forestry, wildlife and related activities) and addresses issues such as land tenure security, decentralization
and environmental management. It is therefore more complex than traditional sub-sector projects. To
facilitate smooth implementation, a comprehensive Implementation Manual is being prepared. A draft of
this Manual was reviewed during negotiations. The project will be implemented largely through national



- 5 -
institutions, committees and village organizations that already exist. The creation of new management
structures will be minimized, and only undertaken to improve the consultation process and coordination
among existing bodies.
18.   The project will be implemented by the concemed communities, NGOs and govemment agencies.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAL) will be responsible for overall project implementation
through its Natural Resources Management Unit (NRMU), which includes staff from the Ministry of
Finance and Planning (MFP) and the Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE). Other key agencies
include the Niger National Geographic Institute (IGNN), and the Niger National Research Institute
(INRAN). A Natural Resource Management Steering Cor ,mittee (NRMSC), which will include
representatives of key ministries and communities, will oversee implementation. An advisory group
composed of NRMSC members and donor representatives, will be set-up to facilitate consistency of
approach nationally.
19.   In each of the selected districts, a NRM District Team (DT) will help communities acquire skills,
organize, prepare NRM plans, obtain financial and technical support, and implement local development
plans. The NRM District Committee (NRMDC), comprised of govemment representatives and community
representatives, will review and approve the plans.
20.    Communities will establish a Local Council for Natural Resource Management (LCNRM) that
will be supported by the District Team as well as by the agriculture extension service and other district-
based technical support services. Communities will prepare NRM plans and submit them to the NRM
District Committee for technical and financial support. If approved, the plans will be executed by the
communities. Prior community approval will be required before the project implementing agency will be
able to make local-level procurement or disbursement operations.
21.   Human Resource Development and Public Awareness Campaigns will be contracted to local
private firms or NGOs. Assessment of Natural Resource will be carried out by the Technical Support Unit
(UTA) of the environment department in the MWE and in cooperation with IGNN. The Natural -Resource
Information Network will be coordinated by the NRMU with the participation of INRAN, IGNN and UTA.
Research will be carried out by INRAN within the framework of the on-going IDA-funded Agricultural
Research Project. Research activities not related to agriculture and studies will be contracted to competent
institutions or firms.
22.   The NRMU staff, assisted by short-term consultants, will prepare studies and reports and present
the RDSC with the recommendations related to NRM policies and strategy.
23.   Lessons Learned from Previous IDA and Other Donors Involvement. IDA has a rich history of
experience with the rural sector in Niger. The Maradi Area Development Project (Cr. 1026 - FY80) and the
Dosso Area Development Project (Cr. 967 - FY80) showed that increased inputs such as chemical
fertilizers do not necessarily result in increased outputs, even under favorable climatic conditions; sound
agricultural practices are essential for sustainable agricultural development and growth. Sustainable
practices include soil and water conservation, production and use of organic fertilizers, agroforestry, and
crop diversification. These will all be promoted under the proposed project. The Second Forestry Project
(Cr. 1226 - FY82) demonstrated that, under prevailing conditions, free standing forestry projects were not
economically viable and that integration with agricultural and pastoral activities was necessary. Similarly,
the major lessons drawn from the Niger Livestock Project (Cr. 885 - FY79) were that strong links between
pastoral, agricultural and forestry activities are essential under Sahelian conditions.



24.   The domestic energy component of the Energy Project (Cr. 1880 - FY88) has successfully
promoted improved use of existing natural resources (trees for fuel) and increased rural incomes. The
recommended next step is to move towards a more comprehensive approach that would deal with all the
natural resources available to local communities. The Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1618 - FY85)
generated substantial incremental food crop production and rural income. The increases could not however
be sustained after project completion because the top-down approach adopted by the government's
implementing agency failed to empower farmer cooperatives. A community-based approach that gives
communities the authority to make decisions over the management and use of natural resources will be
fundamental in the follow-on Pilot Private Irrigation Project (Cr. 2707 - FY95). The Small Rural
Operations Project (Cr. 1890 - FY88) laid a foundation for multidisciplinary teamwork and beneficiary
participation at local level. It did not, however, deal with the entire community and its natural resource
endowment; rather, it promoted independent, income-generating operations for selected target groups.
25.   In general, the lack of successful monitoring and evaluation tools has prevented past projects from
timely detection of possible shortcomings and the introduction of necessary changes in the course of
implementation. This makes assessment of impact difficult. Top-down approaches prevailed in most
project, and even projects located in the same zone had difficulties communicating and cooperating.
Limited efforts were made to involve women except when their labor was required, little attention was
given to land tenure issues, and inconsistent relations were maintained with traditional community leaders.
In designing the present project, careful consideration was given to all these issues.
26.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. The proposed project is consistent with the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on May 31, 1994. The CAS states that IDA's strategy is based
upon four major building blocks: (i) addressing long-term human capital (including poverty alleviation) and
natural resource issues; (ii) building public and private sector institutions to promote private sector based
growth; (iii) increasing the efficiency of public resource management; and (iv) supporting actions to
facilitate a supply response in the wake of the devaluation of the CFA franc. More specifically, the CAS
calls for an integrated sectoral strategy in environment, agriculture and natural resource management. It
supports the Government's strategy to ensure the efficient and sustainable use of natural resources in Niger
and to promote agricultural growth. The project's participatory approach also corresponds to IDA's
strategy of enhancing local governance.
27.   The proposed project will: (i) build upon natural resource management experience gained through
recent projects that were funded by IDA and other donors; (ii) complement IDA's key role in the provision
of agricultural services supported by the on-going Agricultural Services and Agricultural Research
Projects; (iii) operationalize IDA's support and commitment to environmental protection; and (iv) improve
donor coordination. The proposed project will lay the foundation for development of the National Natural
Resources Management Program which constitutes the main framework for addressing issues to be
identified in the National Plan for Sustainable Development. Through the on-going Small Rural Operations
project, IDA is financing small infrastructure in rural areas and supporting export promotion. Institutional
changes will further improve government services (research and extension) and cooperative development.
The NNRMP will complement on-going and planned efforts by helping to minimize the impact of the agro-
ecological constraints hindering agricultural supply response. It will support policy reforms in the
agricultural sector by giving local communities increased autonomy and capacity to manage natural
resources, and by improving land tenure security.
28.    There are presently some 100 initiatives in Niger in NRM, land management, forestry, fisheries,
wildlife, livestock, agriculture, water resources and rural development, with a total investment of about
US$450-500 million. The key donors involved in NRM-related activities are: Canada, Denmark, France,



- 7 -
Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, the United States, as well as FAO, IFAD, UNDP/UNSO. The
NNRMP will be the main instrument for communication, exchange of information, coordination and
harmonization of all the NRM-related activities and projects in the country. There are converging views
among all agencies of the opportunities created by the CBNRM approach; a genuine interest is expressed
by several rural communities, and a growing number of NGOs are present in Niger that have solid field
experience with rural community development.
29.   Agreed Actions. The IDA Credit will become effective once the following actions have been
completed: (i) UTA has been staffed in accordance with the Implementation Manual and has prepared a
work program satisfactory to IDA; (ii) the Borrower has adopted an Implementation Manual, satisfactory
to IDA; (iii) in addition to the NNRMP Coordinator, at least six technical experts, the procurement expert
and the financial expert have been recruited with terms of reference and qualifications satisfactory to IDA;
(iv) an accounting and financial management system, satisfactory to IDA, has been set-up for the Project;
(v) the Borrower has opened a Project Account in a commercial bank and has made a first deposit of
US$400,000 equivalent in the Project Account, representing the first payment on its financial contribution
to the Project; (vi) the Borrower has opened five District Accounts; (vii) the Borrower has appointed an
auditing firm acceptable to the IDA; and (viii) the Danish and Norwegian grants have become effective.
30.   Pover-v Categorv. The great majority of Niger's poor are concentrated in rural areas. The actions
financed under this Project will strengthen the capacity of smallholder farmers to expand the production of
food crops. The support to rural microenterprises and the actions designed to facilitate small-farmer access
to financial services and enhance land security will improve income levels and alleviate rural poverty. The
project is part of the Program of Targeted Interventions.
31.   Environmental Impact. The broad objective of the program (para. 10) is to reverse current land
and natural resources degradation in order to achieve sustainable agricultural production and growth, and
improve the living conditions of Niger's rural communities. As a result, the project will have a positive
impact on the environment. It will improve soil, water and vegetative conditions, and promote biodiversity
development. CBNRM plans will anticipate any potential negative impacts and make provision for their
mitigation. Adequate provision has been made under the natural resource assessment, and the monitoring
and evaluation components of the Project to evaluate the state of natural resources, assess the broader
impact of the Project's intervention, and decide on corrective measures. The project is classified as
Category C.
32.    Program Objective Categories. The project is in line with the Bank's environmentally sustainable
development strategy. The project is also consistent with the Bank's poverty reduction and women in
development strategies. Its field activities will concentrate in rural areas and will primarily benefit the
poorest segments of the rural population. By strengthening their capacity to increase food production, the
project will help enhance food security. The strategic focus on smallholder intensification of production
using low-cost low-risk techniques, will perrnit the efficient and sustainable use of water and land
resources, and help conserve the environment.
33.    Participatorv Approach. The project promotes stakeholder participation. It will use the
Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) Approach, a participatory process that
promotes communication and partnership between the community and CBNRM program staff. The
approach will lead to implementation of a plan for sustainable use of natural resources. Stakeholder
participation in planning, implementing and co-financing project initiatives will foster local sense of
ownership and responsibility for managing the assets created with project support.

34.    Project preparation was carried out over a period of several years during which field initiatives
were tested in several villages with the direct involvement of beneficiaries. Pre-appraisal included several
workshops that involved all concerned Nigerien agencies, donors and representatives of the target
population. A team building technique --the ZOPP or Objective Oriented Planning Method-- was used at
the pre-appraisal stage to help clarify needs, objectives and related project activities. Staff from the NRM
national programs in Mali and Burkina Faso contributed to the preparation and appraisal process by
sharing their experiences and assisting in program design. A working group on gender issues, led by two
women, was set-up to ensure that gender considerations were taken into account in designing the project.
Benefits
35.    The project will have a broad range of quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefits. It will
substantially improve the quality of life of about 200,000 people in five districts of Niger and another
70,000 people in other parts of the country. It is estimated that at least 80 percent of the beneficiaries will
be rural poor. The project will improve the socio-economic and environmental conditions of rural dwellers
by empowering local communities, improving their management skills, and enabling them to make medium
and long-term investments in natural resources management and production infrastructure. The project will
enhance the role of women in NRM, increase land tenure security and facilitate the adoption of more
sustainable land use and production systems which will help restore ecological stability, and increase
agriculture, forestry and livestock production. The environment and resource management experiences
acquired through this endeavor will be disseminated to other parts of Niger, in order to benefit additional
communities. The Government and the people of Niger will benefit from strengthened institutional capacity
to manage and monitor the natural environment. The availability and quality of data on natural resource
use will be significantly improved, and trend analysis will provide critical information to policy makers for
use in preparing and implementing the National Plan for Sustainable Development.
36.    No overall rate of return was estimated for the project as a whole because (i) the scope of the
project includes a considerable institution strengthening component for which a stream of benefits is
difficult to quantify; and (ii) the participatory nature of the project renders it impossible to determine the
precise mix of activities farmers will adopt and the overall rate of adoption. In order to assess the
attractiveness of individual investments and packages of investments a financial analysis of the packages of
the investments promoted by the project was undertaken in three sample locations in districts with varying
agroecological characteristics2. The results indicate that the proposed packages had financial rates of return
between 16% and 35%. Since environmental benefits were not accounted for and shadow pricing of labor
would lower the economic cost of the main input, it can be assumed that the economic rates of return will
actually be higher. When other non-quantifiable benefits such as those related to the building of
institutional capacity in the Government and private sector are added, the project can be expected to have a
high economic return.
37.   The project will be monitored using four primary performance indicators: (i) number of NRM
plans approved by NRM District Committees; (ii) proportion of village land placed under the sustainable
management systems promoted by the project in selected villages; (iii) the number of fully operational
community-based natural resources management plans; and (iv) the level of co-financing by local
communities.
38.   Project Sustainabilitv. The project promotes sustainable agricultural development by focusing
comprehensively on production, the impact of production on the natural resource base, and the natural

resource base's capacity to sustain production in the long-term. The most critical factors for project
sustainability are found at the community and national Government levels.
39.    Community ownership will be the first guarantee of sustainability. CBNRM plans will be prepared
with external technical and financial assistance, but decisions on the content of these plans will rest
ultimately with communities, which will be responsible for co-financing and managing implementation.
Long-term sustainability at the community level will become possible as improved land use, production
systems and technologies are promoted in communities possessing the necessary know-how, and legal,
technical and financial tools to properly design and implement plans. Despite the promising results already
achieved in implementing community-based natural resources management plans in Niger, Mali and
Burkina Faso, there exists the risk that some communities will not fully conmmit to the project's objectives
and make long-term investments because the effects of environmental degradation are not always well-
comprehended and perceived.
40.    On the national level, sustainability will depend upon the Govemment's continued promotion of the
approaches and activities of the project after project termination. This is likely to happen because the
project supports a national program, the NNRM, that is one of the comerstones of Niger's rural
development strategy. In fact, this project represents the first time slice of a long-term program for which
the Government of Niger is seeking long-term partnerships with donor agencies. The Government envisages
that the program will continue for at least twenty years in order to reach most of Niger's rural
communities. A change in Government policies and programs is possible, but this does not appear likely at
this time.
41.    The project has minimum recurrent-cost implications. The amount of counterpart funds required
from the Govenmment is very limited, with a substantial proportion (36%) to be provided before
effectiveness. Support for field implementation will be provided by local contractual staff, who will assist
local communities to design and implement management plans. Assistance will terminate once targeted
communities have been organized and trained, their management plans designed and approved, and the
main investments completed. Communities will maintain investments using mostly their own labor and
local materials and will need only limited additional technical support from the national technical support
services available at the local level.
Risks
42.       The principal project risks relate to (i) the willingness and ability of communities to commit to
the project objectives and engage in participatory planning and long-term investments, and (ii) the capacity
of the Govermment to implement the program.
43.       Communities may not be fully aware of the seriousness of the threat of environmental
degradation, especially if occasionally favorable climatic conditions (such as repeated good years of
rainfall) give a false sense of security and hinder effective mobilization. This risk is addressed using
periodic awareness-raising and information campaigns, and exchanges of experience among villages facing
varied degrees of land degradation. Communities may also be reluctant to accept the planning methods,
technological packages and the shared financing arrangements proposed by the project. Often farmers are
risk adverse and resistant to change. This risk is addressed by: focusing on technological packages that are
part of or consistent with those adopted by the national agriculture extension services, working only with
interested groups, involving farmers in the planning and selection of activities, and limiting local
contributions to the provision of labor and local materials.



-10-
44.       The Government may not diligently implement programs and laws that may be crucial to
success. These include the program on decentralization which will help fully empower local communities,
and the new land tenure law. In both cases, fear of possible social and political repercussions may delay
Government action. While implementation of these programs and laws may be essential to ensure
sustainability in the longer term, it is not likely to have a significant impact on project implementation. The
Government may also face difficulties ensuring cooperation among the various agencies, and operation of
the institutional arrangements required for efficient implementation. These risks are considerable and
cannot be totally mitigated. They will be detected in a timely manner through a monitoring and evaluation
system that will alert project managers to emerging problems and changing conditions, and enable them to
address difficulties. Annual reviews will concentrate on these emerging problems and work closely with the
Government to identify corrective action.
45.       The project involves a significant level of risk but is worthy of implementation because it will
have high environmental and economic returns, help channel resources where they are most needed, and
leverage additional resources from local communities for rural development and environmental
conservation.
Recommendation
46.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of IDA and
recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

(1) A first preparation mission took place in March 1988, followed by a pre-appraisal mission in October 1988. The findings of
the pre-appraisal mission were that the proposed project was simply a continuation of the IDA-supported Forestry Project and
Livestock Project with no links between thesc two sub-sectoral components and the integrated natural resource management
approach. The mission was therefore aborted. In October 1989, the first identification mission took place based on the concept
of Community-Based Natural Resource Management. Project preparation was also hampered and delayed due to frequent
turnover of Niger Project staff, the weakness of preparation team, the lack of good leadership and, in the last three years,
political turmoil in the country. Since March 1995, the situation has improved significantly.
(2) This report is based on the findings of a pre-appraisal mission that visited Niger in April 1994 followed by an appraisal
mission in July 1994. The pre-appraisal mission consisted of Abdelkrim Oka, Senior Enviromnental Specialist, Mission Leader
and Task Manager (AF5AE); Annick Lachance, Agro-Economist (IDA Consultant); Francis Mody (AF4NI); Muimana Kalala,
Monitoring and Evaluation (Laval University); Mike Speirs, Economist (IDA Consultant); Yves Prevost, Enviromnental
Information Systems Specialist (IDA Consultant). The following also participated in the work of the pre-appraisal mission:
Madicke Niang (AF4NI); Banry Rands and Curt Nissly (USAID, Niger); Robert Winterbottom (IRG/USAID-Niger); Alex
Faizoun, EIS (UNSO Consultant); and Haffner (GTZ-Niger). The appraisal mission consisted of Abdelkrim Oka (Mission
Leader) and Annick Lachance. Dirk Elsen, Legal Advisor for Niger (LEGAF); Rougui Diallo (AF4NI); and Alex Faizoun also
particpated in the work of the appraisal mission. This report was prepared by Abdelkrim Oka. Cynthia Cook is the managing
Division Chief. Olivier Lafourcade is the Department Director, and Franz Kaps the Operations Advisor. The peer reviewers
were Francois Falloux (AFTES) and Christian Pieri (AGRNR). Lucy Tran, Operations Officer (AF5AE) provided support for
the COSTAB, financial and procurement matters. Bernard Abeille provided advice on procurement.

STATEMENT ON OUALITY OF CURRENT PORTFOLIO
The Niger portfolio in FY95 consisted of 12 projects, corresponding to a commitment level of US$250.9
million of which US$137.85 million was disbursed as of June 1995. A notable improvement in
performance from FY93 to FY94 was partly reversed in FY95 by a general deterioration in the
implementation environment in the country. For all projects, the persistent fiscal crisis in the country and
the ensuing protracted social unrest have radically changed the operating context of the portfolio. The
share of the problem projects increased to 41.7 percent in FY95. Generic issues include lack of
counterpart funding and poor project management. However, increased supervision efforts helped project
directors to address generic implementation issues and to start introducing a sector-side perspective into
project design and implementation. The disbursement ratio increased from 13.1 percent to 16.8 percent in
FY95. USS27.2 million were disbursed in FY95 under investment projects compared to about US$34.1
million in FY94.
