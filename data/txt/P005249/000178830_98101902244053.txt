INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
FOR A POTASH PILOT ENGINEERING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, for the equivalent of $1.0 million,
to finance part of the foreign exchange cost of engineering and other tech-
nical services required to prepare and develop a pilot potash project in
Jordan.  The project would also be financed by USAID and the Arab Potash
Company (APC). The credit would have a term of 10 years, including 5 years
of grace, and would be refinanced on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Association if the full-scale potash project proves feasible.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Jordan in January 1974, and its report
entitled "Current Economic Position of Jordan", (8479a-JO dated November 5,
1974,) was distributed to the Executive Directors on November 15, 1974.
Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        Before the 1967 war with Israel, the Jordanian economy grew at
about 8 percent per year in real terms. Price stability prevailed, and high
levels of foreign assistance sustained a high level of investment and a surplus
in the balance of payments. However, Jordan's economy was adversely affected
by the 1967 war and the confrontation with the Palestinian Fedayeen groups in
1970/71. The occupation of the West Bank, with 30 percent of Jordan's popula-
tion, deprived the country of about 40 percent of its GNP, and over 200,000
refugees emigrated to the East Bank. Growth of agriculture, tourism, and in-
dustry was curtailed, and the economy's dependence on external transfers in-
creased. The latter, together with net factor income from abroad, accounted
for about a quarter of GNP since 1969. In 1970/71, the Government's efforts
to check the activity of Palestinian guerillas provoked economic sanctions
against Jordan by some Arab countries. Jordan was particularly affected
by the closure of the Jordanian-Syrian border from July 1971 to November 1972,
which resulted in a decrease in exports from S41 million in 1969 to $32 mil-
lion in 1971, by the suspension of budget support from Kuwait and Libya after
1970, and by the closure of the Syrian-Lebanese frontier during the first half
of 1973. Following the October 1973 war and an Arab summit conference at
Rabat of 1974, more financial aid from OAPEC sources was granted to Jordan.
4.        After a period of economic stagnation from 1967 to 1970, signs of
economic recovery began to appear in the second half of 1971, with agricultural
output recovering to the level of 1967. In 1974. agriculture recovered
sharply from the drought of 1973. Industry picked up in 1972, and reached
almost full capacity utilization in 1973.    In 1974 industrial production is



estimated to have grown by over 6 percent.   Exports of goods rose sharply
from S32 million in 1971 to $58 million in 1973, and are estimated at over
$150 million in 1974, reflecting increased phosphates prices. Overall economic
growth is likely to have reached 8 percent in real terms in 1974, partly
due to the recovery of agricultural production from a bad crop in 1973. With
the reopening of the Syrian frontiers with both Lebanon and Jordan in mid-1973,
an improved domestic political situation, and a revival of private investment,
the economy of Jordan has good prospects for renewed growth. A five-fold
increase in phosphate prices since 1972 and an expected expansion in phosphates
production from 1 million tons in 1973 to 3 million tons in 1975 (and to 8
million tons by 1980) have improved the balance of payments prospects. In-
creased costs of oil requirements may be expected to be offset by a correspond-
ing increase in royalties from oil pipeline through-put. However, since
imports represent more than 40 percent of GNP, the economy remains strongly
affected by increases of world prices.
5.        The return of internal stability in 1971 permitted the Government
to devote more attention to medium- and long-term economic issues. The
planning machinery was reactivated with the establishment of the National
Planning CouIIcil (NPC), in late 1971, and of coordination committees with
the private sector. As a first step, a Three Year Plan (1973-75) was prepared,
which aims at achieving an 8 percent annual rate of growth with relative price
stability; creating new jobs in an attempt to reduce the 8 percent unemployment
rate and the serious underemployment in the East Bank; and improving manpower
skills through vocational and technical education. The Plan also aims at
fostering a more equitable distribution of economic gains between the various
income groups and geographical regions, mainly through rural development and
improvement of housing and public services; and at phasing out the economy's
heavy dependence on foreign budget support by reducing the budget and trade
deficits through increased domestic revenues and foreign exchange earnings.
6.        The Plan envisages a thorough restructuring of the economy by reduc-
ing its heavy reliance on services (about two-thirds of GDP), and on defense
(about 22 percent of GDP in 1973), and by developing agriculture, manufactur-
ing and mining, both through institutional and infrastructure support to pri-
vate initiative and through public investment in production enterprises if
needed. in agriculture, which accounts for about 18 percent of GDP, one-third
of commodity exports and 30 percent of employment, emphasis is placed on dev-
elopment of irrigation and, to a lesser extent, on improvement of rainfed
farming to exploit the substantial potential for export--especially citrus
and other fruits--and for import substitution of wheat aand meat. Support of
manufacturing and mining, which account for about 114 percent of GDP, 7 percent
of emDloyment and two-thirds of commodity exports (half of which are phos-
phates), aims at making production more competitive and export-oriented,
particularly to neighboring countries; developing fertilizer production based
on the country's phosphate reserves; increasing the production of Jordan's
high quality phosphate rock; and exploiting the country's deposits of potash
and copper. Four large projects, in phosphates, potash, fertilizer and copper
production, aim at reducing budget and trade deficits by generating substan-
tial foreign exchange earnings.



-3-
7.        The plan anticipated an aggregate investment of $557 million from
1973 to 1975. However, the achievement in the first two years was somewhat
slower than was expected. Public investments were 49 percent of what was
planned in 1973 and 1974, and private sector investment was 46 percent of the
target during the same period. External financing accounted for 44 percent
of total investment for 1973 and 1974: 59 percent for the public sector, and
12 percent for the private sector. W4hile investments in transportation and
agriculture were about 75 percent of the planned target on the average, in-.
vestments in the social sectors such as education and health were very slow
(less than 20 percent). The public sector's performance is expected to improve
in 1975. Budgetary funds were earmarked to compensate for the shortfalls of
the previous two years, in addition to meeting the original target for 1975.
8.        The pattern of external assistance to Jordan in the recent past has
largely been influenced by the unsettled conditions of the region. Transfers
to the Government, mostly in the form of budgetary support and military aid,
averaged $140 million per year during 1967-73. Under the Khartoum Agreement,
Jordan received subsidies amounting to about $105 million annually from Kuwait,
Libya and Saudi Arabia in 1967-69. Saudi Arabia maintained financial assis-
tance in 1970 and increased its aid from $40 million to $64 million in 1972.
Substantial US transfers (around $60 million in both 1972 and 1973) compensated
for the suspension after 1970 of the payments from Kuwait and Libya; Kuwait
resumed its support in April 1973, raising total official transfers received
by Jordan to $179 million in that year. In 1974, budget support amounted to
$168 million, mainly from the Arab countries ($123 million), but also from
the USA ($45 million). It also received $28 million in development loans
in 1974, of which Kuwait provided $3 million, Federal Republic of Germany
$14 million, and IDA around $5 million.
9.        The new emphasis on development and an extensive project list pre-
sented in the Plan have helped to increase development aid. New commitments
over 1972-73 amounted to $137 million, mostly from Western sources, Kuwait and
IDA.  Average terms on $92 million committed in 1973 were about 1 percent
interest, 7 years of grace and 30 years maturity. The gross inflow of long-
and medium-term capital to the central and local governments, which had
averaged $10 million per year during 1967-70, increased to an average of more
than $30 million annually after 1970. The external public debt, including
undisbursed amounts, was about $325 million at the end of 1973, of which about
13 percent was held by the Bank Group. The outstanding and disbursed debt at
the end of 1973 was estimated at $225 million. Because of the concessional
terms, the debt service ratio was low, at 6.5 percent in 1974. Nonetheless,
because of the difficult development problems arising from the country's
still unexploited natural resources, serious underemployment, and the progres-
sive reorientation of the economy which is likely to follow the development
of new centers of economic activity and possibly a peace settlement, Jordan
still needs a substantial part of external assistance on concessional terms.



- 4-
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
10.       Jordan has to date received ten IDA credits totalling $53.8 million
(net of cancellations). Four credits were made before 1967--two for agricul-
tural credit ($6.0 million) and two for water supply ($5.4 million)--and are
fully disbursed. War and local disturbances adversely affected the pace of
economic development and Bank Group lending resumed in mid-1971. Credits
were made for a highway project ($6 million) in 1971; a first education proj-
ect ($5.4 million) in 1972, and a second one ($6.0 million) in 1975; a power
project ($10.2 million) in 1973, a water supply project ($8.7 million) in
1973, and an irrigation project ($7.5 million) in 1974. Performance under
these projects is generally satisfactory. A $5.0 million credit for a second
power project has been presented recently to the Executive Directors. IFC
made two investments in Jordan consisting of a $224,000 equity participation
and a $1.6 million loan to Jordan Ceramic Industries Limited (JCI) in 1974,
and also a $3.7 million equity participation in the promotion of a phosphatic
fertilizer project. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits and
IFC investment as of April 30, 1975, and notes on the execution of on-going
IDA projects.
11.       In 1974, the Government requested the Bank to help formulate and
prepare a program of development projects in the Rift Valley where Jordan's
most important and largely unexploited mineral and agricultural resources
are located. Their development is considered critical to reinforce Jordan's
export production and balance-of-payments position, to assure sustained eco-
nomic growth and provide higher income and living standards. Large mining
projects in phosphate, potash and copper, a phosphatic fertilizer project,
and the related port and railway development are included in the package,
as well as further development of the water resources of the Jordan Valley
and the region south of the Dead Sea. These developments, together with the
establishment of industrial zones and supporting services for light manufac-
turing and tourism in other parts of the country, would contribute to reduce
the present trend of excessive concentration of economic activities in the
Amman-Zarqa area. Preparatory studies are also underway for projects in rain-
fed agriculture which would expand cereal and livestock production and reduce
the country's dependence on agricultural imports. In view of the magnitude
of the new investments contemplated and of Jordan's reliance on external fi-
nancing for the bulk of them, the Bank has requested the Government to review
this program in the framework of the current three-year Plan so as to estab-
lish priorities in light of the financial resources likely to he available.
This review has been initiated by Government and the results are being in-
corporated in the next Five Year Plan (1976-1980) nlow under preparation.
12.       Since 1973, the Bank has been acting as Executing Agency to a three-
year UNDP Planning Assistance Project based in the National Planning Council.
The planning team has been working with the NPC on project preparation and
appraisal. The Bank is also acting as Executing Agency for a UNDP-financed
study of industrial investment opportunities and industrial estates in Jordan.

PAPT III - THE INDUSTRIAL AND MINING SECTOR
13.       The manufacturing and mining sector in Jordan is small in both ab-
solute and relative terms. It accounted for 13 percent of GDP at factor cost
in 1973. The industrial sector is mainly composed of a few large companies
which enjoy strong government support. Of the 589 establishments employing
5 or more persons each, only 55 firms accounted for 55 percent of the work
force in these establishments, 87 percent of the fixed assets, and 78 percent
of the value added. Of even greater significance is the dominant role of the
8 largest establishments which account for 26 percent of employment in firms
employing 5 or more persons, 53 percent of the fixed assets, and 47 percent
of value added. The 1971 industrial survey indicates that 25,800 persons or
7 percent of the East Bank labor force was employed in industries and mines,
of which 58 percent in the establishments employing 5 or more persons each.
The following six industry groups, arranged in descending order of importance,
employed more than 1,000 workers each: mining and quarrying, mineral based
manufacturers (including cement), food processing, textiles, apparel, and
petroleum refining. Existing industrial activity is heavily concentrated in
the Amman-Zarka area. Of the 589 firms identified in the 1971 survey, as many
as 497 were located in this area. The Government wishes to develop industrial
employment in other population centers of the country, but progress in regional
dispersion of industry is likely to be slow.
14.       The three-year development plan (1973-75) contemplates investment
of the order of JD 26.1 million ($86 million equivalent) for the manufactur-
ing and mining sector. The scope for development of large-scale enterprises
has been under fairly intensive examination by Government agencies, in coop-
eration with domestic entrepreneurs and foreign technical consultants, for
some time. A few major industries have been initiated or licensed including
a ceramics plant, a textile mill of 10,000 spindles and 400 looms in collabor-
ation with a Taiwan firm, an expansion of the existing cement plant, a steel
(bars) re-rolling mill, and a glass sheet plant. Projects for a phosphatic
fertilizer plant, an electric steel furnace, a second detergent plant, and
an extension of the petroleum refinery are under consideration. At present,
there are only few industries based on domestic agricultural produce; flour
milling and allied industries, such as baking and pastas; oil pressing,
tomato processing candies, tobacco products, etc. Their main limitation
to development is in inadequate quality and quantity of raw materials
supplies.
15.       The Government has taken an active role in promoting the growth of
industrial and mining sectors. In the past, it has contributed share capital
and extended loans to almost all the major industrial undertakings in the
country, such as phosphate mining, cement, petroleum refining, paper board,
leather tanning, woolen textiles, vegetable oils, soaps and toilet require-
ments. It is also involved in almost every new investment through import
licenses and investment incentives. Since there is only negligible domestic



- 6 -
production of capital goods and machinery, most industrial projects approved
by Government under the Encouragement of Investment Law are generally allowed
to import machinery and equipment duty free. In addition, new enterprises
may become eligible for remission of income and social service taxes on pro-
fits for a period of six or nine years (depending on shareholding and location
of the enterprise) and exemption from taxes on land and buildings for five
years. In some cases customs duties on imports of raw materials and compo-
nents may also be waived or reduced, and protective duties on imports of com-
peting products may be raised. Applications are scrutinized in the Ministry
of National Economy and considered by a committee on which other ministers,
the Central Bank and the private sector, are represented. Final approval is
given by the Council of Ministers. In 1973, the Industrial Development Cor-
poration (IDC) was created by law as an autonomous entity, with the Minister
of National Economy as President. The organization is expected to act as a
holding company for all Government investments in industry and actively pro-
mote further industrialization. The nominal value of the investments now
vested in IDC amounts to JD 9.1 million or 36 percent of the total investment
in these companies. The Industrial Development Bank (IDB) was founded in
1965 to provide term finance for industrial and tourism investments. In 1974,
about 45 loans for JD 2 million were approved.
16.       The scope for development of medium and small-scale industries is
substantial, but its realization will depend on the extent of incentives and
assistance available to them. Under existing practices, the level of protec-
tion available through tariffs and the administrative licensing system is
more than adequate, but growth of new enterprises and expansion of existing
firms is somewhat handicapped by the existing fear in government circles of
"excessive" competition which led in some cases to formal restrictions on
new ventures. With respect to small-scale enterprises, the Government has
hitherto paid rather limited attention to their financial problems. Medium
sized establishments have fared better, in the context of the limited domes-
tic market, and have benefited considerably from the Government's policies
for promotion of domestic industry. During the past year, the Government
has recognized this situation and has formally expressed its intention to
promote small scale industries.   The IDB has been asked to work out details for
a scheme to assist small scale industries and artisans, and agreed to develop
and implement it on condition that the Government would underwrite the finan-
cial burden. The intention appears to be that special assistance should be
given to really small enterprises in need of sums ranging between JD 100 and
JD 1,000.. (IDB's lending is limited to amounts in excess of JD 1,000.) The
initial fund contemplated for this project is JD 300,000, but it has not yet
been committed. There is both need and room for assistance to a larger number
of cases in this size group.
17.       The single most important commodity export of Jordan is phosphate
rock; it has accounted for 24-28 percent of total commodity export earnings
in the past five years and amounted to $70 million for about 1.5 million
tons in 1974. Plans are now underway to expand production to 10 million



--7-
tons by 1981. The country has a very promising mineral resource base, and
the Government is actively pursuing its investigations to exploit other min-
eral deposits such as potash, copper, and manganese in the Wadi Araba area.
Feasibility studies for exploitation of tripoli, feldspar, gypsum, marble,
etc., are in various stages of progress. Exports of cement come next in
importance and amounted to less than $5 million in 1974. Other significant
industrial product groups include: cigarettes, wet batteries, textiles and
apparel, leather and leather-products, and paper-board. Exports of these
groups have fluctuated substantially from year to year in response to a
variety of circumstances, particularly the closure of borders for political
reasons. Prevailing wage levels for unskilled labor allow for exports of
relatively labor intensive products to middle-eastern markets but are prob-
ably too high to compete in other export markets with Asian low cost producers.
PART IV - THE PILOT PROJECT
General
18.       The project will be located in the southern basin of the Dead Sea,
in a location where the shallow depth and hot arid area offer good opportu-
nities for mineral recovery aided by solar evaporation. The Dead Sea is an
inland lake about 80 kilometers (km) long, up to 18 km wide, and covers an
area of about 900 square km, between Israel and Israeli-occupied Jordan ter-
ritory on the west and Jordan's East Bank. It is fed by the Jordan and
Yarmouk rivers and by other streams, but has no outlet. Low rainfall, high
ambient temperatures, low humidity, and prolonged sunshine have gradually
concentrated the dissolved mineral contents of incoming waters to about 30
percent, compared to about 4 percent for most oceans. The Sea essentially
comprises two basins--the main northern one which is relatively deep (down to
400 meters) and the smaller, southern one which is only about 1 to 5 meters
in depth. These basins are joined by a narrow stretch of water formed by the
Lisan Peninsula that juts from Jordan, as shown by the maps in Technical Ap-
pendix III.
Past and Present Dead Sea Potash Production
19.       Production of potash (also known as muriate of potash or KCl) 1/
from Dead, Sea brine has a long history which is detailed in Appendix 1.    Brief-
ly, the Arab Potash Company (APC) which was formed in 1956 had undertaken
preliminary investigations in 1960, and subsequently retained several inter-
national consulting firms to make detailed studies of the civil work and
processing facilities required, as well as the annual capacity and production
cost needed to establish a viable project based on solar evaporation. These
studies indicated a yearly production and sale of 1 million tons of muriate
1/   KCl marketed as fertilizer component, contains 60 to 62 percent of K20,
its active nutrient element.



to be feasible, and plans for project financing and implementation were made
in conjunction with the Bank Group, USAID and W.R. Grace Co. of USA in 1966/67.
However, these were interrupted by the 1967 hostilities and were not subse-
quently pursued.
20.       Meanwhile, after solving major dike and processing problems, the
Dead Sea Works, Ltd. (DSW) in Israel which was partly financed by the Bank in
the 1960's brought into operation a potash project using solar ponds con-
structed in the Israeli zone of the southern end of the Dead Sea. This proj-
ect has gradually achieved a current capacity of about 1.2 million tons per
year (tpy) and a further expansion of 300,000 tpy is being undertaken. DSW
potash is now sold to many countries and that project can be considered a
technical and commercial success. In its fiscal year ending March 31, 1974,
DSW sold about 848,000 tons of potash at an average price equivalent to about
$50 per ton KC1. Pre-tax profit was 21 percent of sales.
World Potash Markets and Prospects for Jordanian Production
21.       The world potash market is characterized by a heavy concentration
of production in six countries (USSR, Canada, the German Democratic Republic
and the Federal Republic of Germany, USA and France, in that order), supplying
more than 90% of the world output totalling about 40 million tons in 1974.
Current Bank forecasts are that world potash supply should slightly exceed
demand until 1980/81, assuming that developing countries will have to rely
increasingly on the USSR for their supply. The uncertainty connected with
any forecast for the USSR and the yet unknown impact that the announced new
Canadian tax laws will have on new potash investments there, make the future
supply of potash to the developing countries rather insecure. The envisaged
start-up of the full-scale potash project in Jordan is in the early 1980's,
at a time when the presently known expansion plans of the world potash indus-
tries are not yet sufficient to cover the projected world demand. At full
production, the output from the Jordanian project will only be slightly higher
than one-third of one year's increase in world potash demand, estimated at
about 1.7 million tons of K20 during the first half of the 1980's. Provided
that price and quality are in line with competition, there should be no major
marketing difficulties for the Jordanian potash output, almost all of which
will have to be exported. The fact that Jordan is close to potential markets
in Asia is expected to help achieve competitive cif costs by comparatively
low transportation charges. Latest commodity forecasts indicate that potash
prices in current dollars are expected to rise from a present range of $70
to $75 per metric ton of KCl, to about $90 and $115 (current dollars) per ton
in 1980 and 1985, respectively. Based on capital and operating costs tenta-
tively estimated by consultants, these projected prices should insure a good
earnings margin for the full scale project which has access to virtually un-
limited potash sources and free use of solar ene,rgy to provide much of the
plant's heat requirements, factors which shoulc! enable it to maintain a strong
competitive position as compared to non-solar potash projects.   However, be-
cause the trial dike recommended by the 1967 studies is still needed, and
because changes have occurred in the physical and financial parameters of the
project since the detailecd studies were undertaken about a decade ago, it is



-9-
essential to test and revise all the technical and commercial aspects as out-
lined herein, before the final design and construction of the full scale
project.
Development of a Full-Scale Potash Project
22.       The full-scale potash project to be eventually undertaken will cover
the design, construction and operation of a plant and all offsites to produce
initially at least one million metric tons per year of coarse potash and
other marketable products (as KCl) from Dead Sea brine with the aid of solar
energy. To the extent possible, proven technology will be used for dike
building, solar pond construction and operation, potash processing and puri-
fication, confirmed and modified where necessary by data obtained during the
pilot project. The full-scale project is anticipated to take between 6 to 8
years to attain full commercial production after the pilot project has been
completed, depending on the extent of field problems encountered, and anti-
cipated cost in current dollars is in-the $175 to $200 million range. It will
be possible to define these figures more closely after completion of the pilot
project. Preliminary studies indicate that adequate water, power and trans-
portation facilities would be available. However a complete township would
have to be built, with sufficient amenities to house several hundred workers
and their families.
The Arab Potash Company
23.       In 1956, the Government of Jordan, together with other Arab govern-
ments and some private shareholders, founded APC to sponsor the potash proj-
ect. In 1958, the Government granted a 100-year concession to APC, giving
it exclusive rights for the extraction of potash and other minerals from Dead
Sea brine. APC's initially authorized capital was JD 4.5 million (US$14.2
million) of which the founder governments subscribed and fully paid for
JD 1.175 million. In 1962, the remainder of the shares was offered to the
public and about JD 2 million were subscribed. When project preparation
was halted after the June war in 1967, APC dismissed its staff except for a
small accounting unit. Private shareholders with 1,000 shares or less were
given the opportunity to return their shares at the original subscription
price. Present governmental shareholdings in APC are as follows: Jordan -
JD 500,000; Egypt, Iraq, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia - JD 125,000 each; Lebanon
and Syria - 62,500 each; and Qatar - JD 50,000. In addition, about 460
private shareholders hold about JD 257,000. Total share capital amounts to
JD 1.432 million. APC invested its funds in Governmental Development Bonds
(JD 1.0 million) and bank deposits (JD 0.6 million). No dividends were paid.
Its Board of Directors has five members, three, including the chairman, re-
present the non-Jordanian shareholders, two are appointed by the Government.
The chairman is President and Manager of the Arab Bank, Jordan's largest com-
mercial bank.

The Proposed Pilot Project and IDA Credit
24.       In 1974, the Government renewed its interest in a potash production
project and asked Jacobs Engineering Company (JEC) of the U.S. to undertake a
brief updating of the 1966-67 study for review by IDA. The review concluded
that the project would still be viable, even though capital costs would be
appreciably higher than those estimated in 1966/67. Following the recom-
mendations which had already been suggested by consultants during the mid-
1960's, JEC again advised that the construction of a trial dike and detailed
field work, as well as extensive engineering and marketing studies, should be
undertaken as a preliminary step to the full-scale project. IDA's review sup-
ported the recommendation of JEC that such work was needed in order to estab-
lish firmly the technical feasibility of the potash production project, and
to provide a better estimate of that project's technical requirements and
costs as well as its commercial viability. Consequently, the Government de-
cided to reactivate the potash production project on the basis of first carry-
ing out adequate field investigations (the proposed pilot project). The pro-
posed $1.0 million c:redit wouild assist in financing the required pilot project
which has heen developed in close cooperation with IDA. Negotiations were
held in Washington on May 27, 1975. The Jordanian Delegation was headed by
Dr. Hanna Odeh (President, National Planning Council) and it also included
Mr. Khair El Din ElMaani (Member of the Board of the Arab Potash Company).
25.       The overall program for proposed construction of a potash produc-
tion facility has been divided into three phases, of which the pilot project
comprises Phase I (see Annex III). The pilot project includes building a
trial dike to determine optimum full-scale design and construction methods,
and undertaking evaporation and physico-chemical tests to establish the best
means for recovering and producing commercial grades of potash. It also
includes marketing and feasibility studies in order to identify as closely as
possible the financial, economic and commercial prospects for the envisaged
1 million tons per year production project. The trial dike construction will
involve considerable field work, including boring and core testing of the sea
bed and surrounding soft shore, plus grouting experiments to determine the
optimum way of minimizing leakage. Potash recovery and processing trials will
determine the best ways of removing salts from the ponds following precipita-
tion by solar evaporation, and converting them to acceptable grades of potash
for overseas sales. The pilot project will also include studies to ensure
that adequate utilities would be available for a full-scale project, and no
harmful ef'fluents would be emitted. Ample construction materials, utilities
and transport facilities exist in the project area to meet the relatively
small needs of the pilot project. HIowever, suitable housing and supporting
facilities will have to be provided to attract the required technical, super-
visory and skilled operating staff to this remote area.
Pilot Project Cost and IDA Financing
26.       Forty-five companies expressed interest in the project.    In consulta-
tion with IDA, the National Planning Council (NPC) prequalified six engineer-
ing consortia which submitted proposals in March 1975. The prevalence of US
consortia among them could have been anticipated since the technology involved



- 11 -
and the operation of quite similar projects occurs principally in the United
States. NPC then appointed a Special Committee to evaluate the technical pro-
posals received. Final selection which is a condition of Credit effectiveness
(Section 5.01(d) of the Credit Agreement) is expected by July 1975. Field
visits by the Committee have been made to some relevant solar evaporation-
based potash projects in which various members of the consortia reportedly
played a major part, in order to assess more fully the competence and expe-
rience of the bidders. An experienced independent potash industry consultant
also took part in these visits. The contract with the selected consortium
will be signed with APC, after approval of the selection and the contract by
the Association.
27.       The consortia prequalified to carry out the pilot project have not
provided estimates of the total cost of the project because of the large number
of unknowns inherent in the experimental nature of the investigations involved.
However, based on the fixed fees provided in their priced proposals and on the
judgment of IDA technical staff on the expected cost of goods and services re-
quired, the total cost of the pilot project, excluding duties, taxes and in-
terest during construction, but including physical contingencies and price
escalation has been estimated to be about $10 million. On this estimate, the
foreign exchange component of the project is estimated at about $6.0 million,
the balance being for local expenditures, including labor and civil works.
The $6.0 million foreign exchange component would be financed by the proposed
$1 million IDA credit and by $5.0 million out of the proposed $6.0 million
AID credit, which AID expects to approve in early FY76. The $4.0 million
local cost component of the project would be financed with $3.0 million from
APC and with the remaining $1.0 million from the AID credit. The proposed
$1.0 million IDA credit would finance 50 percent of the foreign exchange ex-
penditures for engineering services estimated at $2.0 million. Since the
estimated cost of the project is necessarily conjectural, and until the se-
lected consortium can make more detailed analyses, the estimated distribution
between foreign and local costs is also tentative. Should the project cost
less than $10 million, the savings will be divided between AID and part of
APC's contribution. Should the project cost more than $10 million (see para.
31), the additional expenditures will be borne by the Government.
28.       The Government would make available to APC on terms and conditions
acceptable to the AID and the Association the funds which would be provided
by AID and IDA to carry out the pilot project. Should the full-scale potash
production project be implemented, the assets financed by the Government for
the pilot project will be transferred to the company owning the production
project--APC or any successor thereof--in the form of equity or in any other
form as may be agreed at that time with the lenders providing financing for
the full-scale production project. These lenders would probably include some
of APC's present shareholders, the Bank Group and AID. However, if the full-
scale project were not to proceed for any reason, the expenditures by APC on
the pilot project would have to be written off, except to the extent where
equipment purchased could be used elsewhere. However, the recommended review
procedure including the interim evaluation of expenditures and results of the
pilot project (see para 31) should limit any unnecessary expenditures.

29.       The proposed $1.0 million IDA credit to the Government would have a
term of 10 years, including a grace period of 5 years, and would be refinanced
under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association (Development Credit
Agreement Section 3.01(c)) in the event the full-scale project proves feasible.
The USAID credit to the Government would be for a term of 40 years, including
a grace period of 10 years, and would bear an interest rate of 3 percent per
annum during the first 10 years, and 4 percent per annum thereafter.
Pilot Project Execution and Control
30.       The implementation of the pilot project will be the responsibility
of APC which as a condition of effectiveness (Section 5.01(e) of the Credit
Agreement), will have to set up a Project Implementation Unit specifically
for this purpose. The unit will be headed by an experienced and competent
project manager acceptable to the Association. The project manager may be
initially appointed on an acting basis but must be able to devote sufficient
time and given enough authority to fulfill his task. He will be supported
by an appropriately qualified staff initially consisting of a chemical
engineer, a civil engineer, an accountant and requisite office personnel.
If a suitably experienced team cannot be maintained by APC, then the reten-
tion by APC of an appropriate, independent Jordanian or expatriate owner's
representative/technical advisor would be required (Section 2.07(b) of the
Project Agreement) to reinforce the Project Unit until APC and the financing
agencies mutually agree the Unit is capable of undertaking its responsibili-
ties without further independent assistance. The consortium undertaking the
Pilot Project will be asked to advise the Project Manager of any need for
additional Jordanian or expatriate staff, as the work proceeds. The respon-
sibilities of the Manager will include liaising closely with the engineering
consortium and providing it with full support; monitoring project progress,
maintaining time and cost schedules, and also promptly issuing detailed
monthly reports to the Government, APC, USAID and IDA. Contractual arrange-
ments for local labor, materials and services would be the direct respon-
sibility of the consortium via its own Jordanian representatives. The Project
Manager will report directly to the Chairman of APC or its designate on the
Board.
31.       Consortia estimates of the time required to complete the pilot
project ranged between 17 and 27 months; IDA staff expects it to be completed
in about 24 to 27 months. As mentioned, the cost of the pilot project esti-
mated at about $10 million is considered a reasonable upper limit which
would be sufficient to produce the information required to determine whether
and how to proceed with the full-scale potash production project. In order
to prevent an open-ended contractual relationship with the consortium, the
contract to be signed with the selected consorLium will contain certain
restrictive provisions to avoid unnecessary expenditures (Project Agreement
Section 2.02(b)). Accordingly, the consortium contract will provide that:
unless the Association and the Borrower shall otherwise agree, (a) total ex-
penditures for the pilot project would have a maximum limit of $10 million;
(b) the project would be completed within 30 months from signing of the con-
tract; and (c) after 12 months following commencement of work or expenditures



- 13 -
of $5 million, whichever comes first, the ongoing work and proposed dates and
costs to completion will be reviewed by APC, the Government, USAID and IDA.
The purpose of this review would be to determine whether the work should pro-
ceed based on the preliminary findings then at hand, or whether the upper
limits on costs and time schedule should be revised. Any cost increases over
the present limit of $10 million would be borne by the Government. The abil-
ity of the consortium implementing the pilot phase to stay within the set
limits, including tailoring the work where feasible, would be regarded as an
important factor in determining whether there can be any role for this same
consortium in implementing the subsequent execution of the full-scale produc-
tion project.
Procurement
32.       The proposed $1.0 million IDA credit should finance about 50 percent
of the anticipated foreign exchange expenditures for engineering services of
the consortium selected. AID would finance the purchase of US equipment and
the balance of the cost of engineering services, assuming a whole- or partly-
US consortium is selected; it would also finance local labor and materials.
The consortium is being selected in accordance with IDA procedures; AID
procurement will be in accordance with AID's normal procedures. APC would
finance local expenditures. In the unlikely case--based on a review of pro-
posals to date--that a wholly non-US consortium is selected, APC would fi-
nance the service fees in excess of IDA's contribution, and AID would finance
equipment, which would have to be procured under their guidelines, and local
expenditures. APC will contribute at least $1.0 million equivalent to be
disbursed on an approximately parallel basis with the proceeds of the pro-
posed IDA credit (Project Agreement, Section 2.01(c)).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
33.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Hashemite Kingdom
of Jordan and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Asso-
ciation and APC, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article
V, Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
34.       The following provisions of the draft Development Credit Agreement
are of special interest:
(i)  Section 5.01 (e) of the draft Development Credit Agreement
requires APC to establish a Project Implementation Unit
acceptable to the Association prior to effectiveness.
(ii)  Section 5.01 (d) of the Draft Development Credit Agreement
requires APC to select and appoint the consultant engi-
neering consortium prior to effectiveness.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Cr. No. 262 Highway Project; US$6 Million Credit of June 28, 1971:
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
This project includes the construction of a highway from Amman to
Zarka and the financing of a study to identify the most suitable means of dis-
tributing traffic from this new road within Amman. Completion of the road
construction works has been delayed by about two years (to about August 1975),
due mainly to management problems of the Contractor. Construction costs have
increased by about 20 percent due to this delay, extra works, and higher
prices. The Closing Date, originally December 31, 1974, has been extended to

Cr. No. 285 Education Project; US$5.4 Million Credit of February 11, 1972:
Closing Date: April 30, 1976
The project includes construction and equipment of two comprehen-
sive secondary schools, a polytechnic and trade training center, a teacher's
training college for preparatory and secondary schools, and extension of an
agricultural teacher training college and related technical assistance. All
contracts for civil works were awarded to local firms on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding. Contracts were signed in May 1974, and con-
struction started in early June 1974. Bids for about half of the equipment
and all of the furniture were received in May 1974, and contracts have been
awarded. Cost overruns are expected to be about 35 percent for the total
project and will be met by the Government. After initial delays of about
five months, physical implementation is proceeding satisfactorily and is
expected to be completed by April 30, 1976 closing date. However, an ex-
tension of the Closing Date by one year will be required for the completion
of the technical assistance program.
Cr. No. 385 Amman Water Supply and Sewerage Project, US$8.7 Million Credit
of May 24, 1973; Closing Date:December 31, 1977
The project aims at alleviating serious water shortages and insuffi-
ciency of sewerage services in Amman, reducing the high percentage of unac-
counted for water, and developing the administrative structure of the entity
responsible for Amman's water supply and sewerage systems. The project is
progressiQg satisfactorily, and procurement is on schedule. Financial results
are better than appraisal projections, and progress has been made on improving
the organizational and financial systems. However, unaccounted water losses
are still high at about 50 percent, and a leak detection survey has been ini-
tiated in November 1974. A draft water tariff study has been completed.

Cr. No. 386 Power Project, US$10.2 Million Credit of May 24, 1973:
Closing Date: March 31, 1977
The project is the first Bank Group power project in Jordan and would
help the power sector to change over from diesel to steam power generation, add-
ing 78 megawatts to present total generating capacity, and helping meet rapidly
rising demand through 1977. Tne project will also provide a reliable and cen--
tralized source of power. Progress in executing the project is satisfactory,
although the commissioning of the gas turbine was delayed by about one year
mainly due to civil works difficulties.
Cr. No. 498 Northeast Ghor Irrigation and Rural Development Project; US$7.5
Million Credit of July 25, 1974: Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The project is part of an overall development scheme for the East
Bank of the Jordan Valley, other parts of which will be financed by the German
Federal Republic, USAID, and the Kuwait Fund. The project consists of the agri-
cultural development of 7,700 ha net, of which 6,660 ha are already under irri-
gation, and the provision of rural development facilities for domestic water
supply, health, education, roads, and community development for a population of
about 25,000. The project is a year behind schedule and progress in implement-
ing it has been unsatisfactory; the cost of the project has increased by about
40%. The Government has taken steps to speed up the implementation of the
project, and the next supervision mission has been scheduled for July 1975 to
review progress in project execution.
Cr. No. 534 Second Education Project; US$6.0 Million Credit of March 12, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project is designed to expand vocational and technical education,
to promote quality improvements in secondary education by replacing uneconomic-
ally small rented school buildings and providing schools with adequate work-
shops, and to support integrated rural development projects in the Jordan Val-
ley through a pilot scheme of non-formal basic education. The project would
include construction, furniture and equipment for the following institutions:
a polytechnic at Irbid; a training complex at Aqaba; a Hotel Training School
at Amman; three comprehensive secondary schools; extension of preparatory and
secondary schools (seven pre-vocational workshops, five science laboratories,
four women's craft centers); and a rural development center.

TECHNICAI APPENDIX I
JORDAN - POTASH PROJECT
HISTORY ANI) PREVIOUS STUDIES
Past and Present Dead Sea Potash Production
1.        First efforts to recover Dead Sea potash were undertaken about 1930
at the northern end by Palestine Potash Ltd. A second plant was built at
Sodom in the south in 1937, and bv 1945 combined production was 100,000 tons
per year (tpy) of KCl. In 1948 both plants were damaged and unable to resume
production but the truce of that year left most of the southern potash facili-
ties in Israel. In 1952, the Israeli Government formed Dead Sea Works Ltd.
(DSW) and restored the Sodom plant, which attained 100,000 tons in 1960. In
1961, with financial assistance from the Bank, DSW4 undertook a large expansion
program which, despite initial difficult technical problems (especially leaking
dikes), has gradually raised potash production to about 1-2 million tpy. Simul-
taneously, other chemicals such as common salt (NaCl), magnesium and bromine
compounds are produced. A further expansion project to increase potash out-
put by some 400,000 tpy is in progress due to growing world markets, which
indicates DSW potash operations to be technically and now also commercially
successful.
2.        In 1956 the Arab Potash Company (APC) was formed to develop a
potash industry in Jordan also based on Dead Sea Brine. Some experimental
work on the northern and southern shores was undertaken and in 1960, A1PC
invited tenders for a study to assess the potential of a solar evaporation
system located at the southern end. The contract was awarded to Western
Knapp Engineering Co. of USA who submitted a report in 1962 for a 250,000
tpy project. This was substantially revised in 1964 and it was evident a
plant of this size was uneconomical. APC then held discussions with the
U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) which, in 1964, retained
Jacobs Engineering Company (JEC) of USA to review the Western Knapp report
and to investigate the establishment of a potash project in greater detail.
JEC in turn retained Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners of London to consult on
dike design, evaporation pans and civil works.
3.        Following this study, a minimum economic size of 500,000 tpy was
evident and in 1965, talks were held between APC, AID and the Bank Group re-
garding possible assistance with financing. The Bank Group indicated it would
be interested, providing (1) a detailed feasibility study confirmed the tech-
nical and financial viability of the project; (2) a partner with experience
in corresponding management, technology and marketing (and who would also
make a significant investment in the project) was secured and (3) the Gov-
ernment would provide a suitable townsite for plant personnel and a suita-
ble road between the plant and the Red Sea port of Aqaba, as well as ade-
quate storage and loading facilities at the port.



- 2 -
4.        APC retained JEC to make the detailed sttudy which was completed
by August 1966 (with the assistance of Gibb, Wimpey and other civil consul-
tants who undertook essential aerial surveys, mapping and soil tests). It
soon became clear that, if the Jordanian portion of the shallow southern
end of the Dead Sea was converted to evaporation ponds (similar to the DSW
method) plant output could be increased from a proposed 500,000 tpy to at
least 1 million tpy for a relatively small additional capital cost, leading
to a substantial increase in earnings, provided the problems of building dikes
on unstable salt and silt beds could be overcome. It was believed by JEC
and its consultants that satisfactory dikes could be built, based on analo-
gous experience. Accordingly, the JEC study was made available to several
interested major chemical companies and in January 1967, W.R. Grace Co. of
USA made a formal proposal for collaboration with APC, including provisions
for technical management during plant construction and operation, as well as
responsibility for marketing. Grace, the Bank Group, JEC and Gibb concluded
that production capacity should be increased to 1.2 million tpy. At this
level, estimated capital costs (excluding financial charges and working capi-
tal) were about $90 million and fob costs, Aqaba, (excluding overheads,
management fee, taxes, royalty and depreciation) were about $7.45 per metric
ton of kcl. Costs of building a trial dike and undertaking test work to
define the parameters of the full-scale solar pans and process plant were
estimated to be about $3 million. During 1966/67, potash export prices, fob
vessel, Vancouver and European ports, were about $22 to $25 per metric ton,
bulk, depending on duration and size of contract. Hence, the project ap-
peared financially viable and was expected to attract the requisite finan-
cing. However, the 1967 Arab/Israeli war intervened and stopped further
progress.
5.         In 1974, renewed interest in the project was expressed by the Gov-
ernment, which asked JEC to undertake a brief updating study for review by
the Bank. This indicated the project might still be viable even though capi-
tal costs would be higher than in 1966/7, because of increased potash prices
and growing world demand. However, construction of a trial dike and detailed
field work, as well as extensive engineering and marketing studies were ad-
vised by JEC to establish new technical and commercial parameters. The Gov-
ernment of Jordan decided to revive the project on this basis and, in late
1974, it invited offers from six prequalified consortia for trial dike con-
struction and initial feasibility studies. These were received in March
1975 and are currently being evaluated by a committee within NPC established
for this purpose.



TECHNICAL APPENDIX II
POTASH PRODUCTION FROM DEAD SEA BRINE
(SOLAR EVAPORATION PROCESS)
1.        The Dead Sea has a salinity of about 30 percent compared to some
4 percent for typical seawater. This represents some 45,000 million metric
tons of dissolved solids, of which 75 percent are magnesium and sodium
chlorides. Substantial quantities of calcium chloride and magnesium bromide
are also present. Reserves of potash (KCl) are about 2,000 million tons and
the local climate, which combines high temperatures and barometric pressures
with low humidity and little rainfall, is ideal for harnessing solar energy
to reduce production costs of potash and other chemicals from the brine.
The main process steps of the conventional carnallite route, as used by the
Israeli Dead Sea Works (DSW) (and by other projects elsewhere in the world)
are briefly described below; a basic flowsheet is attached.
Evaporation
2.        Brine containing about 1% potash (KCl) in the deep section of the
Dead Sea north of the Lisan Peninsula is pumped to the surface and conveyed
via a canal to large shallow ponds. These lie between the southern end of
the Israeli shore and a long dike built by DSW that runs close to, and
parallel with the truce line in the middle of the Sea. (Had sufficient near-
by land suitable for solar pond construction been available, the need to
build costly sea dikes for providing the requisite evaporation area could
have been avoided). The brine is concentrated in the first series of ponds
by solar energy, from an initial specific gravity (S.G.) of about 1.2 to one
of approximately 1.27. At this concentration, much of the salt crystallizes
and falls to the bottom of the ponds, where it gradually accumulates over
several years before being removed. A green dye is usually added to the
brine, which increases the evaporation rate by about 15 percent. The "mother
liquor" is then pumped from these salt ponds to a series of carnallite pans
wherein further evaporation occurs until at an S.G. of about 1.35, carnallite
(a double salt of potassium and magnesium; KClMgCl2.6H20 containing about
27% potash) plus some sodium chloride precipitates. After attaining the
desired bed thickness, the carnallite-salt mixture containing about 35%
carnallite, equivalent to 23% potash, is "harvested" by floating dredges
and is conveyed in slurry form to an adjacent chemical plant on shore. To
maintain optimum crystallizing conditions and to protect the bottoms of the
carnallite pans, a thick layer of common salt is deposited before carnallite
production is commenced.
Potash Production from Carnallite
3.        In the processing plant, carnallite is leached with water to
separate sylvinite (a mixture of potassium and sodium chlorides) from mag-
nesium chloride. The resulting suspension is filtered and the rich magnesium
chloride brine is retained for further use, or returned to the evaporation
ponds, or to the Sea, as required. To separate potash from sodium chloride,
two commercial processes are available. One is a flotation method wherein
sylvinite is treated with surface-active chemicals and blown with air.     The
fine crystals of potash that are released cling to rising air bubbles to
form a froth which is skimmed off and the KCl is washed, filtered, dried



- 2 -
and sent to storage.   The "sink" product of common salt crystals is washed,
dewatered, dried and retained for other uses or for sale. In the alterna-
tive method (which was installed by DSW- some years after the flotation plant
was built) sylvinite is leached with hot water under closely-controlled con-
ditions to dissolve potassium chloride which is then concentrated and cry-
stallized in vacuum crystallizers. After separation, drying and screening
into the desired size ranges, these crystals are treated with an anti-caking
agent and stored for eventual shipment. Because fine crystals are apt to
fuse into large masses during storage and shipment, and also because most
customers want coarse, free-flowing potash, the crystallization method is
now generally preferred and will be the one proposed for APC project.
Pond and Dike Construction
4.        When constructing evaporation ponds, it is essential to minimize
leakage through the bottoms and walls, otherwise much of the desired product
would drain away or, sea water could enter the ponds and greatly reduce the
effective evaporation. Consequently, ponds are frequently sealed by lining
them with specially-treated clays, plastic sheeting or by other techniques.
One common method employed to reduce seepage through walls of ponds built
above or below ground level is to make a barrier by cutting a deep narrow
trench along the center line of each wall and filling it with a specially-
treated clay or cement. In some instances, (as with parts of the DSW main
dike) attempts to build a sea dike first and then install the grout above
and below grade have failed. Instead, the clay core has had to be installed
first, and the protective dike wall built around it.
5.        Constructing dikes on soft or unstable foundations such as the
mixtures and layers of salt, silt and sand existing in and around the south-
ern end of the Dead Sea poses several difficult problems. For example, the
weight of a dike only a few meters high could disturb an unstable foundation
and lead to severe leakage (even if well grouted) and eventual collapse of
the wall. Also, leakage could occur under the grout through a lower pervious
salt or sand layer. In addition, erosion caused by wind, waves and currents
must be countered by covering the dike body with an adequate layer of "rip-
rock". As a result, solar pond dikes, especially sea dikes, need expert
design and construction and can sometimes cost between $0.5 million to $1.0
million per kilometer (km). Furthermore, a large, partially offshore, carnal-
lite/potash solar pond installation of 1 million tpy or so could require 40
to 70 km. of grouted dikes and ditches and cover an area of up to 100 square
km.



TECHN..ICAL APPENDIX III
SCOPE OF WORK*
INVITATION TO TENDER FOR CONSULTING SERVICES
JORDAN POTASH PROJECT
1.        The Government of Jordan wishes to extract one million tons of potash
(100% KCl) per year from the Dead Sea brines. For this purpose the project
will use:
(a) solar evaporation techniques for concentrating the brines and
depositing the carnellite, and
(b) a plant for the chemical processing and extracting of potash.
2.        A number of extensive studies and site surveys, including soil
studies, were completed by 1967. The last and most comprehensive study was
prepared by Jacobs International Inc., Pasadena, U.S.A., and this study was
going to be the basis for the execution of the project starting in 1967.
The conditions in the area interrupted the progress on the implementation
of the project. It is the intention of the Jordan Government now to proceed
with the project as soon as possible, and through international tendering.
3.        Copies of all available studies on the project can be examined in
the offices of the National Planning Council (NPC) in Amman, Jordan. Based
on these studies, it has been established that Consultants are required to
act as an owner's representative, and their work should cover two broad as-
pects, namely civil engineering, and process engineering including related
utilities. More than half of the project cost will arise from civil works.
As specialized experience in each aspect of this project is necessary, the
Government would look favorably on bids by a consortium formed by two or
more firms, each with a specific expertise in one aspect of the project.
4.        During the initial phase, the Client will be the National Planning
Council. After the feasibility of the project has been re-established, the
Arab Potash Company will become the Client.
5.       ,The Scope of Work seems to subdivide itself in three phases as out-
lined below. General conditions relating to tendering for the required ser-
vices are given in Annex I.
SCOPE OF WORK
6.        The work and services to be rendered by the Consultants will be
executed in the following three phases:
*    National Planning Council, Amman, Jordan, November 1974.



-2-
Phase I
(A) As the construction and testing of approximately 1 km. of trial
dike is considered a prerequisite for the final design and prep-
aration of tender documents, the Consultants in Phase I should
issue general tender specifications for this trial dike, recom-
mend the selection of contractor(s), and supervise the works.
With the information obtained in the trial dike construction,
the Consultants should be able to prepare the final design and
specification documents for the whole Project.
(B) A new feasibility study on the basis of (a) the available en-
gineering and other studies, (b) the data and experience gained
during the construction of the trial dike, (c) technological
developments that may have occurred in the meantime, and (d)
any other data that the Consultants may consider necessary,
should be prepared. The new feasibility study should serve
the purpose and requirements of international financing agencies
and help taking a firm decision on the financing of the Project.
Phase II
(A) Preparation of final design and tender documents for the dikes,
and other civil engineering works related thereto, and selection
of Contractor(s) for civil works.
(B) Supervision of the construction and initial operation of the
solar evaporation pans, supervision of construction of all
other civil works, and advise on a training program for the
necessary operational staff for the pans.
Phase III
(A) Preparation of final design criteria for the processing plant
and associated facilities such as utilities and services, of
tender documents for such plant and associated facilities
based on these design criteria, and advise on the selection
of Contractor(s) for their construction and draw-up contracts.
(B) Supervision of the detailed design of the processing plant
and associated facilities, the supervision of procurement,
construction and start-up of the plant and its associated
facilities, and advise on the training program of the neces-
sary operational and administrative staff.
Phase I
(A) The trial dike of one kilometer length has to be constructed
to find solutions--among others--to two major problems:



- 3 -
(i) Grouting of typical salt layers, to find how they can
be made sufficiently impermeable, and to test the ef-
ficiency of the different methods of sealing the salt
layers.
(ii) Constructing dikes on soft grounds to ascertain the
maximum side slopes and amount of displacement, and
to ensure maximum speed and the most economical means
of dike construction without failure.
The principal objectives of constructing the trial dike are:
(a) To verify the accuracy of design criteria, or adapt
them accordingly, and use these for cost estimates and
construction scheduling.
(b) Find proper solutions for any difficulties that may be
encountered during its construction, in order to take
into account such modifications in the detailed design
of the whole solar evaporation complex encompassing
about 45 km. of dikes.
(c) To make construction experience obtained from this
trial dike available to tenderers for the main civil
contracts, to acquaint them with the prevailing con-
ditions in the area in an attempt to secure realistic
bids.
The responsibilities of the Consultants under Phase I will be:
(1) Preparation of design, specifications, drawings and tender docu-
ments for the trial dike, and advise on the selection of the
Contractor(s) for the construction of the trial dike. Assist
during negotiations with the selected Contractor(s), and as-
sisting in drafting the final contract.
(2) Locating materials suitable for dike construction.
(3) Redesign of the dike system in relation to the changing Dead
Sea level:
Since the level of the Sea in the area proposed for
pan construction is a major factor in determining
the dike sections, it is necessary to adjust the
old findings and designs to arrive at final dike
plans.



-4-
(4) Collection of evaporation data:
Evaporation rate is important to pan design as well
as its efficient operation, and it is necessary to
obtain data from all possible sources, published
or otherwise. To obtain additional information
required on evaporation rates, a test should be
carried out on site also.
(5) Determination of a proper and suitable source of fresh water
supply, taking into consideration the Mujib scheme.
(6) Supervision of additional soil tests:
Additional borings might be required on the final
dike lines, at the intake point, plant and housing
sites. Such borings should be specified and carried
out under the Consultants' supervision to the extent
necessary.
(7) Supervision of construction of the trial dike.
(8) Revision of dike design to overcome any difficulty that may
be encountered during construction of the trial dike.
(9) Performance of any additional field work or tests, to fill
in any gaps in previous studies and prepare all information
essential to the final design of the Project.
(10) Revision of design criteria, specifications and drawings of
the dikes and pans in the light of experience gained from
the construction of the trial dike.
(11) Preparation of a time schedule showing proposed dates of
start and completion of each of the various aspects of the
Project.
B.   Preparation of a complete Feasibility Study including the following:
(12) Description of the major features of the Project, the capac-
ities chosen (of civil works, processing and associated fa-
cilities, and end products) and the underlying assumptions,
dike sections, construction methods, major design character-
istics etc., all to convey an adequate picture of the major
features of the Project and the extent to which major Project
parameters have been determined or are still to be determined.



(13)  Estimates of Project costs including all pre-operating ex-
penses, interest during construction, and initial working
capital in adequate detail, for all civil works and all
plant and associated facilities; the basis for the cost
estimates should be given, as well as a justification for
the particular level of physical contingencies and price
escalation chosen.
(14)  Projections of operating (including maintenance) costs,
together with details of the major assumptions made.
Prepare proposals on the organization, structure and
staffing of the Arab Potash Co. before and during pro-
duction.
(15)  Estimates for product transport costs from the plant site
to the Aqaba port and an estimate of the additional invest-
ments, if any, that might be needed at Aqaba for the Project.
(16)  Estimate of approximate port charges.
(17)  Preparation of a preliminary (PERT) time schedule showing
the proposed dates of the start and completion of the cru-
cial elements of the Project.
(18)  Evaluation of potash prices anticipated at the time the
plant is expected to be in operation, including analysis
of global supply and demand of potash, and worldwide com-
petitive potential of the Project.
(19)  Description of possible marketing arrangements for the
Project's products.
(20)  Preparation of a financial analysis of the proposed project
based on the above estimates to determine its financial via-
bility. This analysis should include an internal rate of
return calculation, operating, income and cash flow projec-
tions, and balance sheets, for a period of 15 operating years.
Assumptions on the method of financing the project will be
provided by the NPC.
(21)  To the extent that any cost and price inputs (financial) in
the above financial analysis of the Project, including trans-
port to Aqaba and loading there, differ from their real mar-
ket value (economic), the difference between the financial
and economic input assumptions should be shown, and an in-
ternal economic return calculation be prepared. The expected
net foreign exchange earnings for the country resulting from
implementation of the Project should also be given.

(22) The Consultants shall prepare a study on the ecological im-
pact of the project. Special attention should be paid to
the disposal of by-products, incuding bromine and magnesium
compounds, not only regarding their impact on the environment
but also in respect of future recovery for chemical processing.
(23) The Consultants should be ready to discuss the Feasibility
Study in draft for a period of maximum one week in Jordan
before putting it into the final form.
Phase II
7.        If the results of Phase I are successful, and the financial/economic
feasibility is proven, the Consultants will be authorized by the Government to
proceed with the work on Phase II as indicated below:
(1) Preparation of detailed design, specifications, working draw-
ings and bills of quantity for dikes, pans, canals, foundations
and all other civil works connected with the whole project, in-
cluding buildings and all other structures. The Consultants
should take into consideration the Mujib scheme now under con-
struction, as well as flooding which may occur in the area.
(2) Preparation of detailed tender documents, including general
and special conditions of contract, form of tender, draft of
contracts, and schedule of work for progress control for the
civil works described in item (1) above.
(3) Evaluation of all bids received and, on the basis of this
evaluation, advise regarding the selection of the Contractor
for the civil works. Assist during negotiations with the
selected Contractor, and assisting in drafting the final
contract.
(4) Issue general site instructions to the Contractor and approve
a detailed PERT construction schedule within the context of
the tender document.
(5) Prepare any new drawings or modifications of any existing
drawings required for the civil works.
(6) Inspect all construction work as it progresses to ensure its
correct execution in accordance with the PERT construction
schedule and specifications.
(7) Assist in solving any disputes that may arise with the Con-
tractor and issue all interim and final payment certificates
to the Contractor.

(8) Supervise initial pan operation, including:
(a) Deposition of salt bottoms in the carnallite pans
to the thickness required.
(b) Deposition of carnallite in pans to the extent
necessary to ensure continuous, uniform and suffi-
cient supply of feed to the plant.
(9) Advise on the staffing and training of operational personnel
to be associated with the salt pan operations.
Phase III
8.        Phase III concerns the supervision by the Consultants of the final
design of the processing plant and associated facilities of the procurement
of equipment for this purpose and of the construction and start-up of these
facilities. As the civil works described in Phase II, including the deposit-
ing of carnallite in the pans, will require a considerably longer time than
the design and construction of the plant, Phase III work will not commence
until about two years after the start of the construction of the whole com-
plex of salt pans and dikes.
9.        In order to reduce cost, a first class research organization will
be asked--under supervision of the Consultants--to establish corrosion
rates for the materials to be used in the plant construction. The cost of
such tests will be borne by the Client.
10.       Any travel expenses incurred by the Consultants to execute Phase III
work will be reimbursed by the Client on the basis of U.N. travel and per diem
allowances.
11.       Under Phase III, the Consultants are expected to perform the follow-
ing work:
(1) Prepare specifications for all plant equipment, piping, in-
strumentation, electrical and all other mechanical items for
the processing section, utilities and service facilities.
Careful consideration must be given to any new development
or improvements introduced in, or known about, carnallite
processing in order to reduce projected capital and operating
costs.
(2) Prepare detailed tender documents, including general and special
conditions of contract, form of tender, form of contract for
procurement, delivery and erection of equipments described in
item (1) above.



- 8 -
(3)  Evaluate all tenders received and, on the basis of this eval-
uation, advise regarding the selection of Contractor(s) for
the plant facilities. Attendance during negotiations with
the selected Contractor and assisting in drafting the final
contract,
(4)  Examine and approve all designs, drawings and manufacturing
programs submitted by the Contractor(s).

testings of the facilities (processing plant, power house,
pumping stations and all other ancillary facilities) to
ensure that the operation and production will be in complete
accordance with specifications and objectives.
(9)  Make proposals for a monitoring program to check corrosion
rates in key sections of the plant.
(10)  Supervise start-up operation for a period of at least three
continuous months of production at a minimum of 80% capacity
operation; the Government of Jordan shall have an option to
extend this period on payment of additional fees (to be
specified in the Consultants' bid).
(11)  Assist in solving any disputes that may arise with the Con-
tractor(s) and issue all interim and final payment certificates.
(12)  Keep accurate records and accounts of all aspects of the Project.
(13)  Advise on the training program for the staff of the plant and
its associated facilities in time to secure adequately trained
staff at start-up. Prepare a complete staffing plan.
(14)  Supply the Government of Jordan or its designate upon comple-
tion of the Project with 20 copies of complete records of draw-
ings, manuals and other documents necessary for operation and
maintenance.



ANNEX I
PROCEDURES TO BE ADHERED TO BY THE CONSULTANT
1.        The Consultants should submit their offer to undertake the work
in 6 copies, which should be received by the National Planning Council (NPC),
P.O. Box 555, Amman, not later than                    , 1974.   The offer
should contain detailed proposals on how the work will be executed. Any
company selected for consulting services is automatically barred from consid-
eration for construction contracts.
2.        Price quotations for the Consultants' services and requested
method of payment should be submitted in a separate sealed enveloped which
will be opened only after the descriptive proposals will have been evaluated
and rated. Prices should be quoted in U.S. dollars; if so desired, the Con-
sultants are in addition permitted to quote prices in their own country's
currency, but the Government is not necessarily committed to accept the latter
quotation. The Consultants bidding are requested to submit separate bids for
each of the three Phases of work on the following basis, using the attached
standard form:
Phase I - For the work connected with the construction of the trial
dike, price quotations for the Consultants' services
should be made on the basis of each of the following three
alternatives, stating order of preference:
(a) a fixed fee, plus specified salaries for expatriate
and Jordanian personnel supported by a detailed man-
power schedule and the estimated length and place of
assignment for each person, plus any detailed expendi-
tures not covered by the above;
(b) a fixed percentage of the cost of the dike; and
(c) a lump sum fixed price.
For the feasibility study, a lump sum fixed price should
be quoted.
Phase II - For Phase II, bids should be according to (c) for Phase II
- A, and according (a) for Phase II - B.
Phase III - A price quotation based on a lump sum, on the understanding
that such bid prices might be reviewed at the time of commence-
ment of Phase III in the light of any changed circumstances.
3.        The quotations relating to man-months are to be expressed on the
basis of current salaries (October 1974), and each bidder is to submit his
proposed formula for the escalation of salaries over the expected time of
the work.
