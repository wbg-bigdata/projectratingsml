1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1    Context at Appraisal

1.      At appraisal in mid-2003, Cambodia was experiencing its fifth year of relative peace
following nearly 30 years of civil strife and economic isolation. The population was extremely
poor, with 36 percent of the population living below the poverty line and a per capita income of
US$276 per annum. Cambodia’s road network comprised about 38,250 km, with an average
density of about 0.3 km/person. However, as was true of much of Cambodia’s economic
infrastructure, about 60 percent of the road network was in poor or bad condition and often
impassible during the rainy season. The presence of mines/unexploded ordnances (UXOs)
further limited mobility, especially in the northern region of the country.

2.      The transport sector was deemed of high priority because, as with much of Cambodia’s
economic infrastructure, the country’s roads and carrying capacity had been severely damaged
by the war. Since the mid-1990s, a concerted effort by Government, with the support of the
donor community, had been made to reestablish the country’s main national road infrastructure.
About 1,500 km of national roads and 11,000 km of rural roads were rehabilitated or
reconstructed during this period. Government and donor support was also being directed
towards the most basic needs at the village level through community driven development
projects, and one project had reconstructed tertiary roads in six provinces located in the south-
eastern part of the country.

3.       The Provincial and Rural Infrastructure Project (PRIP) complemented these other
activities as it focused on the road network’s “missing middle?, that is, the part of the network
between the national network and village access roads/tracks. This part of the network was
critical for the reintegration of severely war affected people and areas into the national economy,
and for the creation of opportunities for employment in rural areas and sustained livelihoods.
The needs were especially dire in the far north of the country, as this area was the last area within
Cambodia to experience peace.

4.      At appraisal there was increasing concern that post-war reconstruction gains could not be
sustained. With respect to roads, both the Government’s National Poverty Reduction Strategy
2003-2005 (NPRS) and the Integrated Fiduciary Assessment and Public Expenditure Review
(IFAPER, World Bank, 2003) highlighted the need to shift from the post-war focus on
emergency repair and reconstruction to improved planning and management of roads. Key
elements of such a shift were predictable funding for roads, timely road maintenance,
prioritization of interventions in accordance with economic principles, and transparency and
accountability in the use of funds. All were important if the gains from repair and reconstruction
of approximately five percent of the total network were to last.

5.      The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, 2005) sought, among other things, to
provide greater access for the poor to basic social services and economic opportunities. Since
about 85 percent of the population and 90 percent of the poor resided in rural areas, a main focus
of the CAS was on the provision of rural infrastructure services and other means to promote rural
development. The four provinces selected for PRIP were in the far north of the country and the

                                                 1
poorest and most isolated provinces in all of Cambodia. The Project directly supported those
CAS objectives that were directed towards:

      a) improving governance through capacity building and road sector reforms aimed at
         strengthening provincial management of secondary and tertiary roads, local participation
         in road selection, and transparency in contract management;
      b) rehabilitating physical infrastructure at the subnational level to improve access to markets
         and essential services; and
      c) creating opportunities for local contractors and consultants, along with technical
         assistance and training to enhance their capacity to carry out works and provide services.

1.2       Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

6.      The development objective was to assist the Kingdom of Cambodia to enhance the
livelihood of the peoples residing in the provinces of Kampong Thom, Oddar Meanchey, Preah
Vihear and Siem Reap by providing sustainable access to markets and essential services through
(i) a program of road rehabilitation and maintenance; (ii) a program of capacity building and
training; and (iii) development of improved public policies and strategies.

7.        The key performance indicators given in the PAD were:

         Increase in traffic levels including volume of goods and passenger traffic;
         Reduction in travel time along the project roads between major provincial centers in the
          four provinces and increase in number of villages linked to higher level roads in good
          condition;
         Reduction in transport costs; and
         Increase in kilometers of roads under the Ministry of Public Works and Transport
          (MPWT) and the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) receiving regular routine
          maintenance.

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

8.      The PDO was not revised, but some indicators were modified in the 2010 restructuring.
Details are in Section 1.7.

1.4       Main Beneficiaries

9.      At appraisal the project’s primary target population was defined as all those living,
working and/or settling along the project area roads in the four provinces of Kampong Thom,
Oddar Meanchey, Preah Vihear and Siem Reap (rural home to 1.5 million people out of a total
population at the time of 12.6 million people). The beneficiary population included road users
such as subsistence and surplus farmers, employees in the non-farm sector, health attendants and
civil servants, traders and business people, transport providers, as well as consumers in the small
and provincial towns, local contractors and consultants, and those directly employed in the
rehabilitation and maintenance of the roads. The latter included unskilled laborers from the

                                                  2
project provinces, an estimated 40 percent of whom were women. Secondary beneficiaries
included MPWT and MRD staff at national and provincial levels who would be trained in
priority road maintenance and management, planning, financial management, quality control,
road design, etc.

1.5    Original Components

Component 1. Maintenance Management (US$1.0 million): The project was to support (a)
installation and operation of road maintenance management systems at the national level in
MPWT and MRD and in their respective Provincial Departments located in Kampong Thom,
Oddar Meanchey, Preah Vihear and Siem Reap, and (b) annual programs of routine maintenance
on all roads in good and fair condition in the four project provinces. Routine maintenance was to
be funded from the government’s annual budget allocations.

Component 2. Rehabilitation and Periodic Maintenance of Secondary-national, Provincial and
Tertiary Roads (US$18.65 million): The component included a program of rehabilitation and
periodic maintenance in the four project provinces covering: (a) approximately 300 km of
strategic secondary-national and provincial roads under MPWT; and (b) approximately 300 km
of tertiary roads under MRD. The works were to be contracted out and a program to develop
qualified private contractors was to be run concurrently to increase private sector involvement in
the road sector. To the extent practicable, these works were to be carried out using labor-based
appropriate technology (LBAT) to maximize local employment.

Component 3. Capacity Building Program (US$2.6 million): The project included a program of
institutional capacity strengthening for MPWT and MRD at the national level and their four
Provincial Departments.

Component 4. Policy and Strategy Development (US$0.20 million): The component was to
support a program to improve MPWT and MRD policy and strategy development in the areas of
(a) integrated planning and budgeting of roads; (b) least cost life-cycle standards; (c) use of
appropriate technology; (d) mainstreaming of road maintenance; and (e) institutional reform.
The component also was to support on-going policy development in the transport sector.

Component 5. Community Awareness Programs (US$0.55 million): The component was to
support community awareness programs aimed at increasing awareness of road safety risks,
HIV/AIDS, road planning and access to public information, mine and UXO risks and mine
clearance programs.

1.6    Revised Components – n.a.

1.7    Other significant changes

10.    Project Restructuring. The project underwent two Level II restructurings. The first was
in response to a Bank Department of Institutional Integrity (INT) investigation that uncovered
evidence of corruption, collusion and fraud in four ongoing Bank-assisted projects in Cambodia.



                                                3
In the case of PRIP, the investigation uncovered evidence of fraud and corruption in the
procurement and/or administration of six contracts (two in MPWT and four in MRD).

11.    PRIP disbursements were suspended from June 5, 2006 to February 1, 2007, except for
contracts associated with preparation of the financial audit and the construction of two essential
bridges on a district road. A total of SDR 1.456 million (US$2.29 million equivalent) was
cancelled (and refunded by Government), thereby reducing the Credit amount to SDR 12.724
million. Schedule 4 of the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was amended to require the
borrower to:

      a) select an independent procurement agent (IPA) to undertake all remaining procurement
         activities under PRIP;
      b) reassign project management responsibilities from the project implementation units in
         MPWT and MRD to regular functional units within each ministry, respectively;
      c) acquire full-time engineering supervision services with responsibility for oversight,
         approval and control of contracts;
      d) engage an external technical auditor; and
      e) adopt a joint MPWT/MRD anti-corruption action plan for PRIP.

All conditions were met and the suspension was lifted on February 1, 2007.

12.     The second restructuring, countersigned by the Borrower on December 31, 2010, made
changes to the performance indicators to bring the project outcomes and indicators into better
alignment: (a) Indicators measuring results that could not be directly attributed to the project
were removed, such as increased use of health services, increased use of education services,
volume and revenue of tourism, increased flow of information in rural areas, increased number
of non-farm employment opportunities, and increased number of NGOs active in the area; and
(b) output targets were revised downwards to reflect what could realistically be accomplished
within the time and funding available (see Section 2.2).

13.    Project Schedule. The closing date was extended three times. The first extension, from
September 30, 2007 to September 30, 2009, was to make up for time lost due to the suspension
and slow start-up of the IPA. The second, from September 30, 2009 to December 31, 2010, was
to enable completion of the second annual work program and capacity building activities funded
under the PHRD grant (TF56974). The third extension, from December 31, 2010 to December
31, 2011, was to complete a final six civil works packages that would provide basic all-weather
access and connectivity to higher order roads for a number of poor rural communities.

2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1      Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

14.     Strategic relevance and approach. The project’s objectives were aligned with the Bank’s
and Government’s priorities as reflected in both the CAS and the NPRS. The design of the
project was appropriate and timely given its focus on the sub-national network; this portion of
the network had received almost no attention during the post-war period and many of the roads

                                                4
were impassible. The northern area addressed in the project had been hard-hit by the war, but
similar conditions could be found throughout Cambodia. The idea was to use PRIP to address
the road access needs within and among the four poorest and most isolated provinces, and
subsequently, with the help of other development partners, to extend coverage to other provinces.

15.     Project preparation. Project preparation benefitted from analytical work carried out under
the Road Rehabilitation Project (RRP, Cr. 3181-KH, FY99) and a PHRD grant (TF26422). The
former provided initial thinking on transport sector policy and strategy, including proposals for
legislative and institutional reform. The latter enabled a broader and more intensive analysis of
rural access needs and solutions at the provincial and district levels. The focus of the PHRD
grant in particular was on rural infrastructure needs (not just transport), which accounts for the
name of the project – Provincial Rural Infrastructure Project. However, in recognition of the
limitations of the IDA allocation for Cambodia overall, the Grant Agreement was amended after
six months to focus solely on rural roads and transport.

16.     Safeguards. The project was rated Category A and triggered Environmental Assessment,
Natural Habitats, Cultural Property, Indigenous Peoples and Involuntary Resettlement. Three
important protected areas were located within the four provinces: Beng Per Wildlife Sanctuary,
Phnom Kulen National Park, and Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary. Safeguard preparation was
thorough, commensurate with the project’s rating. This was important as the investments would
occur in areas that were largely unfamiliar with Bank/international requirements and best
practice. The likely incidence of problems was reduced to the extent that the roads were being
reconstructed on existing rights-of-way and the alignments were adjusted to avoid resettlement
wherever possible. In addition to consultations around environmental and social impacts, the
project enlisted the support of NGOs to design and implement public awareness campaigns for
road safety, HIV/AIDS, mine and unexploded ordnance security, and for monitoring of civil
works on the ground.

17.     Project scope. The main focus of PRIP was on provision of road access, and in so doing,
the development of capacity at both the national and provincial levels and of the local contractor
base. PRIP also adopted an inclusive participatory planning approach that was new to Cambodia,
and which subsequently was mainstreamed in the planning for roads. The project did not
explicitly follow up on the broader concepts of transport sector policy and strategy development,
but rather focused on a few specific areas, such as integrated planning and budgeting, that would
lead to improved management of the sector. This was deemed reasonable at the time, as ADB
(through mutual agreement among the development partners and government) was taking the
lead in this area. The Bank’s contribution to policy and strategy development was being handled
under the RRP, which overlapped with PRIP and closed in September 2006.


18.    Lessons incorporated into the project design. The PRIP was the second post-war IDA-
financed engagement in the transport sector. Although the RRP was still underway while PRIP
was being prepared, the following lessons had emerged. The first was that the project design
needs to be simple and manageable in line with the limited institutional and human resource
capacity of the country. This lesson was not fully taken on board, as noted in Quality at Entry
shortcomings below. The second was that client engagement and ownership are important. The

                                                5
project was designed to build on existing structures and, departing from the norm, to be
implemented in large part by the provincial offices of MPWT and MRD. The participatory
planning and decision-making approach highlighted above helped to build ownership within the
various levels of government, as well as among commune representatives and residents. A
related lesson was that civil society involvement builds ownership and requires outreach. This
lesson was addressed by the provincial level capacity-building activities, community-
outreach/informational sessions lead by staff from MPWT and MRD, and NGO engagement
noted above.

19.    Quality at entry shortcomings. The excellent targeting of the project – to address the
mobility needs at the provincial level in Cambodia’s four poorest provinces and build capacity at
both national and provincial level – was important but compromised by five less satisfactory
elements as follows:

   a) Poorly defined results framework. This is discussed in more detail in Section 2.3, but the
      main point is that the PDO was overly broad. Data on many of the outcome indicators
      were hard to collect and not directly attributable to the project;
   b) Underestimation of the high governance risk in the project design. The risk framework
      accorded the project an overall rating of S (substantial risk). However the only risk rated
      H (high) was that a road maintenance policy and maintenance financing mechanism
      would not be established within the three-year time frame of the project. The risk
      associated with security and rule of law was rated M (modest), while the risk associated
      with transparent competitive tendering processes of public road works was rated S. In
      retrospect both of these risks should have been rated H;
   c) Failure to account for the severe capacity constraints of the implementing agencies in the
      project design. MRD, for example, was a relatively new ministry and inexperienced in
      road planning and management, while MPWT was more experienced but under-
      resourced and staffed. The decision to create what were essentially two separate
      implementing units complicated implementation and capacity building arrangements and
      contributed to many of the problems that emerged as the project unfolded. The four year
      project implementation period was too short given the capacity constraints, especially in
      the remote northern provinces;
   d) Overly complex project design relative to the needs of the four project provinces. The
      four provinces were selected because of their extreme poverty and urgent basic
      reconstruction needs. At appraisal this area of Cambodia remained in post-conflict, as
      characterized by sporadic violence, large numbers of displaced persons and limited
      mobility due to the lack of passable roads and presence of UXOs. While broader policy
      and institutional development objectives were important for the sector overall, the needs
      and difficulty of working in these provinces called for a simple project design focused on
      improvements in basic access and hence livelihoods, as per the PDO; and
   e) Lack of due diligence in vetting technical designs and cost estimates. This was most
      apparent in the incomplete designs and unrealistically low cost estimates prepared by ILO
      for MRD’s low volume roads. The target of 300 rehabilitated km of MRD’s tertiary road
      network was unrealistic relative to the funding available.



                                               6
20.     The project quality at entry was moderately unsatisfactory. The rating reflects both
positive aspects, such as the focus on accessibility needs in the four poorest provinces, the
consultative process adopted and well conceived awareness activities, and less positive aspects,
such as the poorly defined results framework and underestimation of risk, the overly complex
design and implementation arrangements, and lack of due diligence in vetting technical designs
and costs.

2.2      Implementation

21.     The project was designed with an implementation period of about four years, but with
one suspension and three extensions, ended up lasting nearly eight years. As noted in Section
1.7, the project was restructured twice, with each restructuring initiating a separate phase of
project implementation as follows:

      a) The first phase was from project effectiveness in 2004 to the suspension of the project
         on June 6, 2006. The suspension was accompanied by cancellation of SDR 1.456 million
         (US$2.29 million equivalent), for the six contracts that had been misprocured. This
         phase focused on implementation of the first year works plan, which covered 310.65 km
         (244.5 km MPWT; 66.15 km MRD) of laterite, single bituminous surface treatment
         (SBST) and double bituminous surface treatment (DBST) works, six wooden bridges
         (route 210), a bailey bridge, routine maintenance of 1143.73 km (686.73 km MPWT; 457
         km MRD), and construction of two provincial offices in Oddar Meanchey Province (one
         for the Provincial Department of Public Works and Transport (PDPWT) and one for the
         Provincial Department of Rural Development (PDRD)).

      b) The second phase was from the suspension in June 2006 to the second restructuring in
         September 2010. The suspension covered all activities under the project except for
         financial auditing services and two bridges deemed essential for access from Salavisai
         Commune to the Stoung District road. On September 1, 2006, the DCA was amended to
         include the conditions to lift the suspension and carry out the project through completion
         (details in Section 1.7). All conditions were met and the suspension was lifted on
         February 1, 2007, enabling work to begin on the second year works plan seven months
         before the original closing date.

      c) The third phase was from the second restructuring in September 2010 through the end of
         the project on December 31, 2011. The second restructuring, approved December 31,
         2010, acknowledged that the initial rehabilitation targets could not be achieved within the
         remaining time and budget. Thus the number of km of secondary-national and provincial
         roads to be rehabilitated was reduced from 300 to 250 km, and of tertiary roads reduced
         from 300 to 80 km. Outcome indicators not directly attributable to the project were also
         removed, leaving those that measured transport costs, road access, capacity building
         within the transport sector and road management.

22.    The first phase began well, and as of February 2005, half of the Credit amount had been
committed in signed contracts.       However by this time complaints of procurement
irregularities had already been received, and an investigation by the Bank’s Department of

                                                  7
Institutional Integrity (INT) was underway. By mid-2005, more shortcomings were apparent.
Sub-standard designs were resulting in multiple variation orders and cost overruns, roads
supervision at the provincial level was inadequate, routine maintenance was not being carried out
(especially by MPWT, as MRD was implementing community-based routine maintenance
contracts), and baseline data were still uncollected.

23.     The suspension lasted eight months, but the project did not get back on track for the
better part of three years. The only civil works completed during this second phase were the
two exempted bridges (completed on January 6, 2007). The Project Implementation Units
(PIUs) were dismantled by mid-2007 and their staff reintegrated into units within the ministries.
Overdue audit reports were submitted, and “baseline data? for the year 2007 were supplied in the
first quarter of 2008.

24.     The IPA was selected in December 2006, but mobilization was slow and the IPA’s
inception report was only issued in January 2008. The IPA’s performance did not improve, and
the first IPA failed to complete procurement of a single contract. The unsatisfactory
performance of the IPA delayed the selection of the Engineer and Technical Auditor (see
1.7(c)+(d)), both newly imposed requirements. Although the implementing staff tried to restart
the project, at most levels staff commitment and enthusiasm had been lost. Unlike the
original consultants whose role was to work alongside and advise their counterparts, the new
positions were to carry out their functions on behalf of their counterparts, thus compromising the
capacity building feature of the project.

25.     In spite of these difficulties, the civil works in the third phase proceeded well, due in
large part to the implementing agencies’ renewed energy and follow-through during this final
phase, complemented by intensive supervision by the Bank. The first IPA had been replaced,
and while there continued to be procurement delays, the contracts were awarded and the works
and supervision proceeded accordingly. By this time much less could be accomplished, as the
cost of labor and materials had increased as a result of the delays and inflation arising from
the 2008 economic downturn and aftermath. The second restructuring brought the project into
alignment with the remaining resources and time to completion. Routine maintenance funding,
which had been slow to materialize, improved and ultimately exceeded project targets.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

26.     Design. As noted in Section 2.1, the key performance indicators and means of data
collection were poorly designed. The key part of the PDO – “to enhance the livelihood of the
peoples residing in the provinces….? was set at too high a level, as the project was targeting
mobility, one step removed from livelihoods. Indicators were specified that could not be
uniquely attributed to the roads, such as increased use of health services, increased use of
education services, increased volume and revenue of tourism, increased flow of information in
rural areas, increased number of non-farm employment opportunities, and increased number of
NGOs active in the project area. The improved roads could ensure access but not the availability
of the services to be accessed. Many of the indicators were not readily quantifiable, such as
increased flow of information, and it was not clear how the indicators were intended to be
measured as the “Data Collection Strategy? column of the Project Design Summary was left

                                                8
blank. A social survey was conducted during project preparation (Annex 5), but the findings
were not reflected in the monitoring plan, and there was no beneficiary reassessment at the
project close.

27.     Implementation. Baseline data were not collected during project preparation or at the
project start. The initial data were for the year 2007, after the first restructuring and three years
after the project became effective. Thereafter the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) table was
updated annually, although some of the data were unreliable or unavailable. As noted in Section
2.2, the outcome indicators were only brought into alignment during the second restructuring in
December 2010.

28.   Utilization. There is no evidence to suggest that the data collected to populate the M&E
framework was or will in the future be used for decision-making purposes.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

29.     Procurement. The project experienced major fiduciary issues with misprocurement
declared on six contracts as stated in Section 1.7. A further procurement problem arose in mid-
2009, with evidence of collusion among bidders for construction of drainage structures on MRD
and MPWT roads. This required rebidding of two packages of civil works, but as there was no
evidence of government staff involvement, the Bank’s approach in this case was to support
MPWT and MRD in their handling of deceptive contractor practices. The experience highlights
that while strength of the project was the packaging of works to encourage participation of the
local contracting industry, it was also a weakness. As the number of local firms with capacity to
take on even the smaller works contracts was limited, it was relatively easy for collusion and
other corrupt practices to take place.

30.     Financial management. Although serious problems were encountered in financial
management (FM) in the early years of project implementation, remedial actions were taken by
the PIUs, and FM received satisfactory or moderately satisfactory ratings throughout most of the
project. A Financial Management Standard was prepared and rolled out under the project
(2009). Both MPWT and MRD encountered difficulties in finding and retaining qualified FM
staff, and the Financial Management Advisor position in each ministry remained vacant
throughout much of the first two phases of project implementation (and again for MRD before
project close). Audit compliance was especially poor in the early years, as the first three audit
reports were seriously overdue and FM was downgraded to unsatisfactory during 2006-2007.
Audit compliance improved, however, from disclaimer of opinion (no opinion provided) for
2004 due to misprocurement, to unqualified (clean) audit opinions thereafter. The unqualified
audit opinions of later years indicated that funds were used for the intended purposes from a
fiduciary perspective.

31.     Environment and Social. PRIP was designed with a number of good environmental and
social features, and these were carried out as planned. These included: (i) a participatory road
selection process for planning and preparation of the project’s annual work; (ii) establishment of
Coordination Committees on Social and Environmental Impacts and Work Quality in the project
communes of MPWT work (MRD used existing Road Maintenance Committees in the

                                                 9
communes) to connect directly with the project; (iii) posting of information on signboards along
the project roads, including project cost and time frame, applicable safeguard frameworks and
grievance redress mechanisms (with contact information and comment/complaint boxes, and also
posted on MPWT and MRD websites); (iv) ensuring that a Grievance Redress Committee was
available in every project commune where local people could log their complaints/grievances;
(v) hiring of local people by the contractors; and (vi) conducting road safety and HIV/AIDS
awareness activities for the project stakeholders.

32.     Environmental and Social Safeguard compliance was satisfactory or moderately
satisfactory throughout most of project implementation. Environmental management plans
(EMPs) were included in works bidding documents, social and environmental training of
provincial offices was carried out. Some problems occurred in areas affected by the routine
maintenance activities and in the environmental management of road works on NR 64 (which
traversed part of the Boeng Per Wildlife Sanctuary). In the latter case, a review mission in mid-
2005 found that the contractor had failed to comply with environmental protection measures
within the Wildlife Sanctuary. This triggered a review of natural habitats in the four PRIP
provinces, with special focus on the road segments proposed in the upcoming work plans and
recommendations for improved management and mitigation in protected areas. In July 2007, the
Social and Environmental Unit of MPWT began to take an active role in overseeing
environmental and social issues under the project, starting with NR 64 and carrying on
throughout the second works program. Two publications – Final Standard Guidelines for
Environmental Safeguards and Final Standard Guidelines for Implementation of Social
Safeguards – were finalized in 2009-2010 and made publicly available in Khmer and English.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

33.     PRIP is the middle project of a three-project sequence that started with RRP and will
conclude with the Road Asset Management Project (RAMP, Cr. 4442), which is scheduled to
close on September 30, 2013. Institutional reform elements, such as the approval of a new
Roads Law, began under RRP and are expected to come to fruition during the next calendar year.
Regular budget submissions are now being prepared by the two ministries and the RGC provides
regular allocations for road maintenance of the maintainable network that exceed the PRIP-
mandated levels. The ongoing development of the Road Maintenance Management System
(RMMS) has been formally transferred to RAMP, but only for MPWT. As MRD’s Road
Management and Planning System (ROMAPS) depend on proprietary software, MRD is now
developing its own spreadsheet-based system using Microsoft ACCESS. Other gains, such as
the participatory approach to planning, have been internalized into MPWT’s planning system for
roads. More problematic is the retention of trained staff, as civil service reforms related to
conditions of service and remuneration have been rescinded but not replaced. Also uncertain are
future arrangements for sustainable financing of periodic maintenance and reconstruction of sub-
national roads.

34.    For reasons unrelated to this project, no new transport sector project is presently included
in the Bank’s pipeline. If in the future, follow up engagements are contemplated, they could
include: (a) a follow-up project that focuses on the subnational network and extends the
coverage of PRIP to other provinces; and/or (b) a sector-wide approach that engages at a higher

                                                10
level to address the larger institutional and financial issues in collaboration with government and
the other development partners.


3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

35.     The project objective remains highly relevant to Cambodia’s development priorities of
inclusive growth, improved rural livelihoods and strengthened institutions. The Rural Roads
Policy recently endorsed by the Cabinet of Ministers articulates the goal of “year-around access
for all?, although how this will be managed is not elaborated. The project objective is consistent
with the third “growth rectangle? in the current World Bank CAS (2005-2011), as it focuses on
rehabilitation of physical infrastructure (in particular transport infrastructure) to support
improved productivity and diversification and access to essential services. The Bank’s updated
IFAPER (Report No. 61694-KH, November 30, 2011) identifies agriculture as both a mainstay
of Cambodia’s economy and important source of growth, but cites lack of investment in rural
infrastructure, particularly roads, as a serious constraint to development of competitive
agriculture.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

36.     The overarching PDO - to enhance the livelihood of the peoples residing in the four
target provinces by providing sustainable access to markets and essential services - was set high
(at the level of impact rather than outcome), especially when taken in conjunction with the
original outcome indicators (in effect for seven out of eight implementation years) of increased
use of health and education services, volume of tourism, non-farm employment and increased
flow of information. The causal relationship exists to the extent that good quality all-weather,
mine-free roads and bridges are essential but not sufficient to achieve these outcomes.

37.      The link between rural roads and improved livelihoods was, however, well documented.
Studies published around the time of appraisal, such as Design and Appraisal of Rural Transport
Infrastructure; Ensuring Basic Access for Rural Communities (April 2001), advocated provision
of least-cost basic access in rural areas to “ensure reliable, all-season passability for the locally
prevailing means of transport?. This World Bank technical paper cited evidence of enrollment of
girls in Bhutan that was three times higher in connected villages as compared to unconnected
ones; and in Andhra Pradesh, India, a female literacy rate that was 60 percent higher in villages
with all-season roads compared to those without. Negative impacts of improved roads, such as
HIV/AIDs transmission and increased numbers and fatality of accidents, were also documented.
The community awareness elements of PRIP were designed to mitigate some of these risks.
The project design and results framework adopted for PRIP thus reflected established principles
at the time.




                                                 11
38.     Field visits, interviews and other anecdotal evidence collected after the PRIP roads were
improved confirm that the presence of good roads and bridges has improved the standard of
living, incomes and opportunities available to residents along the roads and adjacent
communities. This evidence indicates that school attendance and visits to health clinics
increased in response to improved road surfaces and de-mining activities carried out under the
project. More girls now attend school beyond second grade. Residents of three communes
reported transport cost reductions of 50 percent or more, and travel times shortened from days to
hours. Trips that required an overnight stay can now be completed within one day. Bus services
traverse the improved roads and middlemen come to the villages to purchase agricultural
products. Some crop diversification has occurred, as getting produce to market is faster and
smoother. These experiences are recounted by residents in a short film entitled “Connecting the
Ethnic People?, a transcript of which is included as Annex 10.

39.     The main PRIP intervention supporting access to essential services and thus improved
livelihoods was the rehabilitation and periodic maintenance of sub-national roads in the four
provinces. In total, the MPWT rehabilitated 263.4 km of secondary national and provincial
roads and six bridges, and MRD rehabilitated about 84 km of rural roads and two bridges
(selected before and after pictures are shown in Annex 11). As these roads had been selected in
a participatory planning exercise, they were the roads residents deemed most essential for access
to markets and services, for connecting to the national road network, and/or for linking
provincial centers together. The efficacy of this approach was confirmed by the anecdotal
evidence noted above. The resilience of the structures built under the project, plus the
effectiveness of regular maintenance activities, was tested during recent extensive rains and
severe flooding. Most of the project roads survived in good condition, despite the extraordinary
weather conditions of 2009 and 2011.

40.     During the project period the Government also carried out complementary programs of
national and provincial road rehabilitation in the four provinces for about 1,200 km. Together,
PRIP and the Government’s own program made important strides in linking the villages in the
project area to secondary and provincial roads, and in turn to the national network. Before the
project only 708 out of 1932 villages (37%) in the project provinces were linked to secondary
and provincial roads in good condition. After the project, 1059 out of 1932 villages (55%) had
all weather access to the secondary and provincial road networks. While impressive, without the
delays and problems that plagued the first two phases of the project, the level of connectivity
achieved could have been much more.

41.     The second intervention, maintenance management, was directed towards “sustainable
access?. The combination of two sub-components, establishment of maintenance management
systems and annual maintenance carried out on the roads, was intended to ensure that cost-
effective maintenance would be planned and carried out. The output of “maintenance
management systems established and operational in MPWT and MRD? was not achieved. At
project end maintenance management systems in the two ministries were still under development,
but maintenance management plans for each year were being prepared regularly, albeit manually.
The second output was achieved, as 738 km of MPWT roads and 602 km of MRD roads were
receiving regular routine maintenance financed by annual budget allocations from Government.



                                               12
These targets exceeded project targets by about 100% and 150%, for MPWT and MRD,
respectively.

42.     As with the health of Cambodia’s entire road network, the sustainability of the gains
achieved under PRIP and elsewhere depends on clear policies and strategies to shape and
manage the network overall, predictable levels of adequate financing for routine and periodic
maintenance and reconstruction where necessary, and a staff capable of carrying out effective
planning and management of the portion of the network within their area of responsibility.
While PRIP did not address overall policy and strategy, the policy and strategy component
covered a subset of institutional processes and approaches designed to help the ministries to
provide road services more efficiently and effectively. Of these, integrated planning and
budgeting of roads was partially achieved, as now there is a three-year rolling plan and a budget,
least cost life-cycle standards are embedded in planning methodologies, and road maintenance
has been mainstreamed. The use of appropriate technology and institutional reform did not gain
much traction under PRIP, although the latter has been taken up in other contexts.

43.     The capacity building component was intended to help support the effective
management into the medium term of roads under the responsibility of MPWT and MRD. In
line with the decentralized approach adopted in PRIP, training was extended to national and
provincial public works departments, and also to private contractors who were capable of
carrying out civil works but lacked skills related to business processes. The training was
successful in that about 450 staff from MPWT and 215 staff from MRD received training in
project management, planning, road maintenance, road safety, etc. However the link between
the training and the sustainability of improved road services has been seriously compromised by
the Government’s decision to terminate programs designed to adequately remunerate and thereby
retain high caliber staff. Project implementation arrangements that provided for consultant
advisors to work alongside staff of the two ministries to provide hands-on knowledge transfer
were also undercut when conditions for lifting the suspension transferred procurement and
supervision authority from ministry staff to the IPA and Supervision Engineer.

3.3    Efficiency

Overall rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

44.     One of the important features of the project design, commensurate with Cambodia’s
transition from emergency reconstruction to a medium-term planning horizon, was that all
candidate roads for rehabilitation and periodic maintenance would be subject to economic
analysis. Roads to be improved were selected in a participatory manner, taking into account
costs and benefits, traffic volumes, and social and environmental impacts. The proposed road
sections were then subjected to a cost-benefit analysis for the rehabilitation and improvement
works, and cost-effectiveness analysis for the periodic maintenance of lower volume rural roads.

45.     An ex-ante analysis was conducted for Phase 1 roads for which some data were available,
and all remain economically viable. For MPWT, the six roads in the Phase 1 program yielded
NPVs from US$0.025 million to US$8.8 million, and ERRs of between 15% and 21%. These
rates fall within the same general range as the original estimates for the same roads. For MRD,

                                               13
the unrealistically low original cost estimates due to inadequate designs resulted in somewhat
inflated initial NPVs and ERRs. Nonetheless, the substantially higher costs were partially offset
by higher traffic volumes and smoother road surfaces associated with higher road standards. The
MRD Phase 1 roads thus remain economically viable, with ex-ante NPVs of 0.19 million to 1.95
million and ERRs of 19% to 50+%.

46.     The amount of work that could be completed under the project was negatively affected by
the cancellation of SDR 1.456 million associated with contracts that were misprocured, the
suspension and subsequent start-up delays, further deterioration of the roads during the
suspension and aftermath and additional quantities required for their repair, and higher labor and
material costs due to inflation during this period. The ex-ante calculations reflect the higher
costs due to increases in the price of bitumen and other inputs, offset by higher traffic volumes
and VOC savings. The roads remain economically viable, but the negative impact of delays on
the number of km that could be improved, and hence on the individuals that would be served by
these roads, was probably large.

47.      As discussed in Section 3.2 (details in Annexes 3 and 10), focus discussions and
anecdotal evidence from the field confirm that the project brought significant benefits to those
served by the improved roads. Positive impacts cited included large reductions in transport costs,
faster travel times, increased crop prices, some limited crop diversification, higher rates of school
attendance (especially for girls whose school access had been restricted by safety concerns),
better night security due to faster speeds and removal of land mines, improved maternal health
and lower infant mortality rates. The principle negative impact involved traffic safety concerns
associated with higher traffic volumes and speeds.

48.     Employment generation benefits proved to be somewhat limited.                Labor-based
appropriate technology was applied on a couple of small contracts in the first year program, but
the decision to build roads to a higher standard and/or time constraints precluded its application
in subsequent years. Site workers were hired locally for road, bridge, and pipe and box culvert
works, sodding and planting, but the duration of this employment was limited to the construction
period, and the numbers were relatively small. For example, in the order of 20-25 local residents
were employed for construction of PR 213 (about 24 km).

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

49.     Although relevance was high, achievement of the PDO and efficiency are moderately
unsatisfactory and efficacy and efficiency are moderately unsatisfactory; therefore the overall
outcome rating is moderately unsatisfactory.




                                                14
3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

50.     The improvement of national-provincial, secondary and tertiary roads in Cambodia’s four
poorest provinces reduced isolation and improved access to markets, health clinics and schools.
A social assessment survey was carried out in 2003 (Annex 5), but there was no follow-up study
to document changes that occurred. Focus group discussions suggest that the impact was
positive for the entire population, in particular for women and girls. (Section 3.3 and Annexes
3and 10).

51.    Awareness activities both mitigated risk and promoted social development, as about
15,000 people participated in preventive activities (HIV/AIDS, road safety, UXO awareness).
Complaint handling mechanisms were explained at the community level and signboards posted
alongside the roads. Awareness campaigns were reinforced by Bank supervision of social
safeguards in the form of training and other capacity building activities.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening

52.      Overall the effectiveness of the project’s contribution to policy and strategy development
was constrained by the piecemeal approach adopted by RGC and the development partners. The
implementation period was to be four years, and as the condition of the roads was dire, priority
was placed on restoration of basic services. As previously discussed, some important elements,
e.g., a new Roads Law, were being addressed under RRP and elsewhere, and other aspects of
institutional and organizational reform were being addressed in activities supported by other
development partners.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative) - n/a

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

53.    See Annexes 3 and 5.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: High

54.    The main risk to development outcome is lack of funding for roads, particularly for
maintenance. Current allocations for routine maintenance are promising, but over time the roads
will also require periodic maintenance and rehabilitation. The lack of an operational
maintenance management system and of current data to support it affects the efficiency of
expenditures made. Further, while allocations from Treasury for road maintenance have steadily
improved, total funding for roads is inadequate and the risk of inadequate, unpredictable and/or
untimely funding remains.




                                                15
55.     The second risk is the ability to retain technically qualified staff. Both MPWT and
MRD are short of trained staff, and will continue to be until such staff can be adequately
compensated. This is unlikely to occur until civil service reform rationalizes the complement of
staff and offsets the compression of wage scales. The institutions and organizations with
responsibility for roads are also in need of reform. Studies are underway, but the extent to which
the recommendations will be acted upon depends on Government’s commitment to reform. The
decentralization process is an important development, but neither authority nor funding is
currently aligned with this objective.

56.     The third risk is the lack of a policy framework and strategy to guide the
development of the roads and transport sector. Ratification of the proposed Roads Law is
expected soon, which will clarify roles and responsibilities (roads will be classified by function
rather than traffic volumes), but questions remain over such issues as sources of funding for
roads, commercialization of road services and the role of the private sector. Other recent
developments that may represent some modest maturation of the sector include the creation of
the Cambodia Transport Association, the Cambodia Road Association and a new bureau in
MPWT in charge of road concessions.

57.     Fourth, while the adoption of a Good Governance Framework is a good start, the risk of
fraud and corruption remains. Some progress has been made, as measures put in place by the
two Ministries have contributed to more transparent processes and reporting, and the oversight
role of civil society may develop over time.

58.     Finally, the loss of maintenance funding and of the capacity and commitment to
carrying out the works as needed, could result in the untimely deterioration of the roads. The
likelihood that this could happen is judged to be substantial. The high potential impact and
substantial likelihood result in a risk to development outcome rating of high.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
       Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

59.     As noted in Section 2.1, the project was consistent with the CAS and well targeted, as
rehabilitation of the subnational road network in the four poorest provinces addressed an
important impediment to inclusive development. The introduction of participatory design and
oversight processes and awareness campaigns was innovative in the Cambodian context and
changed the way subnational roads are planned and managed in Cambodia. Although the project
had originally been conceived as a multi-sector infrastructure project, the Bank rightly
considered this too complex and early on limited the scope to sub-national roads in a prescribed
geographical area. The PDO, however, remained overly broad, as it focused on “livelihoods of
residents? in the geographical area, and it was measured by outcome indicators that built upon
various mobility requirements that depended on factors exogenous to the project.



                                               16
60.     Project preparation was carried out by a team of specialists with the requisite skills and
expertise to address a broad range of sectoral concerns. A PHRD grant provided support to RGC
for preparation of the project, and Bank resources in terms of staff time and budget were
adequate (details in Annex 4). The infrastructure and community awareness components were
well conceived, the procurement and safeguard documents thoroughly prepared, and the
implementation arrangements considered with some care.

61.     Problems, however, stemmed from the Bank’s failure to account adequately for the lack
of capacity and, in MRD’s case, lack of familiarity with Bank systems and procedures. Among
other things, the decision to establish parallel implementing arrangements in each of the two
ministries added complexity. On a technical level, the Bank failed to identify serious design
flaws and cost underestimates. The poor quality of the designs, especially of MRD roads, not
only affected the quality and quantity of civil works that could be carried out, but also
contributed to governance problems by opening the door to variation orders and cost overruns.

62.     The capacity building component was designed without benefit of an institutional
development or organizational plan to identify job categories and skills required; broad
categories were defined and the training was reportedly useful, but the link to desired outcomes
could not explicitly be made. The policy and strategy development program lacked an
integrative framework; the component simply comprised five practical areas intended to improve
various aspects of decision-making and cost-effective implementation.

63.     To an extent the shortcomings in the project design reflect the difficulty of assessing what
is feasible in a country trying to rebuild after a war. In this context, the extent of uncertainty and
lack of basic government systems and checks and balances could have been better reflected in
the risk assessment. The risk associated with security and rule of law, rated Modest, was much
too soft. Although the overall risk rating was Substantial, given the circumstances it realistically
should have been High.

(b)    Quality of Supervision
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

64.    As discussed in Section 2.2, the Bank’s performance during implementation can usefully
be divided into three phases, with the suspension marking the middle phase. Overall there were
three Bank task managers during project implementation (including the task manager from
appraisal, which provided continuity), and the two transitions were handled well.

65.    The Bank’s supervision was satisfactory during the first phase, defined as from Board
approval to the suspension on June 6, 2006. Intensive supervision was carried out during this
phase, with three regular Bank missions per year, supplemented by procurement and
environment/safeguards missions. Significant problems began to be documented in mission
reports around February 2005. The Bank was proactive in working with the implementing
agencies to find solutions, but slow to downgrade the project, doing so only after the suspension
had taken effect. The decision to exempt from the suspension the construction of two critical
bridges on the Salavisai Commune to Stoung District Road showed commitment to project



                                                 17
beneficiaries and was consistent with the collaborative approach that had been established during
this initial period.

66.     The Bank’s performance during the second phase, from the suspension to the second
restructuring in September 2010, was problematic at two levels. First, the conditions imposed by
the Bank for lifting the suspension put in place parallel systems for project implementation.
While enabling the Bank to lift the suspension, the required outsourcing of procurement and
works supervision undercut the use of government systems and procedures and “learning by
doing? that had been at the core of the project design. The appointment of the IPA and
Supervision Engineer took time and the project stalled. The Bank’s performance in this regard
was unsatisfactory. Second, Bank missions were shorter and somewhat less frequent during this
second period, the mid-term review was postponed indefinitely, the project was not restructured
beyond the conditions for lifting the suspension, and the performance indicators were not
brought into alignment with the reduced available time and funding. The project was upgraded
to moderately satisfactory prematurely in August of 2007, primarily because the PIUs had been
dismantled (another Bank-imposed condition for lifting the suspension) and preparation of the
second year work program had resumed. However as the Bank’s supervision team strove to stay
engaged throughout and to follow up on the full range of implementation issues (technical,
environment, social, financial management, M&E), the Bank’s overall performance in Phase 2
was moderately unsatisfactory.

67.      The Bank’s performance during the third phase, from the second restructuring through
the end of the project, improved again to satisfactory. In mid-2010 the project was downgraded
to unsatisfactory in recognition that the original outcomes and targets could not be achieved.
The project was restructured and extended for one final year on December 31, 2010. The
restructuring revised the M&E targets downward and identified a set of activities that could
realistically be completed within a one year time frame if the project were extended for a final 12
months. The Bank extended the project’s closing date on an exceptional basis (as the project
was rated unsatisfactory) in recognition of the importance of the remaining civil works to rural
communities who still did not have access to an all-weather road. Intensive supervision,
especially by staff in the Cambodia field office, helped to ensure that all activities were
completed within the extended one-year timeframe. Transition arrangements for the RMMS and
some of the policy elements were handled by transferring these activities to the ongoing RAMP.
With two phases of supervision rated satisfactory and one phase rated moderately unsatisfactory,
the overall rating for quality of supervision is moderately satisfactory.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

68.    Quality of entry rated is rated moderately unsatisfactory and quality of supervision is
rated moderately satisfactory. As the project overall is rated moderately unsatisfactory, the
combined rating for Bank performance is moderately unsatisfactory.




                                                18
5.2    Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance
       Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

69.    The Government’s performance during implementation ranged from unsatisfactory
during the first two phases of the project, to satisfactory in the final phase. While initially there
appeared to be high level support for improving budgetary systems and providing adequate
funding for road construction and maintenance, these requisite systems and allocations were
delayed. Also delayed were the finalization and endorsement of the Roads Act, which was
needed to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the various ministries and agencies with respect
to roads. Fiduciary compliance was poor throughout the first half of the project. The first three
audit reports were not delivered on time, and procurement irregularities resulted in
misprocurement of six contracts and cancellation of corresponding amounts from the Credit.

70.     The RGC complied with all conditions to lift the suspension within about seven months
and implemented a number of measures to minimize the potential for future corruption.
Although implementation did not pick up for another year, fiduciary compliance improved,
counterpart funds were available as needed and the works were completed as planned. Planning
and budgeting improved in both MPWT and MRD; budget allocations for road maintenance rose
steadily and in the later years exceeded the targets set under the project. The Social and
Environmental Unit was established within MPWT as planned; and a Financial Management
Standard was prepared and implemented. In parallel to the project, the draft Road Law was
recently endorsed by the Council of Ministers and is scheduled to be submitted to the National
Assembly for approval by September 2012, and a Rural Roads Policy was submitted to the
Council of Ministers for endorsement.

71.      Despite these positive aspects, the seriousness of the misprocurement and concerns over
transition arrangements and the durability of project achievements, particularly for MRD, results
in a rating for government performance of moderately unsatisfactory.

(b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

72.     The implementing agencies of MPWT and MRD appeared fully committed to the project
objectives and promptly began to implement the project. Staff was assigned to the project PIUs,
procurement was initiated, workshops and consultations with subproject beneficiaries were held
in the provinces, and training of provincial staff was promptly offered. Fiduciary and reporting
compliance were more problematic, as progress reports were not submitted, baseline data were
not collected, and development of project websites fell behind schedule. Nonetheless,
implementation progressed reasonably well until serious procurement irregularities came to light
in both ministries. The suspension affected morale at all levels and undercut momentum in
particular at the provincial level. The imposition of parallel implementation arrangements
complicated implementation, and project implementation stalled.




                                                 19
73.     After the suspension was lifted and the implementation arrangements were clarified, the
two implementing agencies, first MRD and then MPWT, resumed implementation of the project.
Fiduciary compliance improved, with audit reports produced on time and project progress reports
prepared at least on an annual basis. The mandated Good Governance Frameworks were
implemented by the two ministries, including civil society organization participation and
establishment on a complaint handling mechanism. The websites and related disclosure of
information of MPWT-PRIP and MRD-PRIP improved as well. The implementing agencies
were instrumental in the second restructuring of the project, including the revision of
performance indicators. However, while monitoring and evaluation data were collected on a
more regular basis towards the end of the project, the use of such information as a project
management tool has yet to gain traction.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
       Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

74.    Government performance is moderately unsatisfactory and implementing agency
performance is moderately satisfactory. As the project is rated unsatisfactory, borrower
performance is thus moderately unsatisfactory.

6.     Lessons Learned

75.    A well formulated sector policy and strategy are essential if gains are to be sustained.
The RGC and development partners have invested heavily in the rehabilitation and
reconstruction of Cambodia’s roads at the national, provincial, district and local levels. However,
commensurate efforts to develop a sector-wide policy and strategy remain fragmented.
Questions as to how road services will be provided, managed and financed have yet to be fully
resolved. The likely passage of the Roads Law and approval of the Rural Roads Policy are
important, but do not fulfill the need for a well formulated policy and strategy to guide the
development of the sector, and thereafter ensure its sustainability. The potential exists for RGC
to address these needs in a sector-wide engagement in collaboration with the development
partners.

76.      The role and importance of a road network’s “missing middle? needs to be
documented and understood. There is a general understanding, supported by extensive
literature on rural roads, that all-weather good quality roads at the subnational level contribute to
the improved health and welfare of those served. Although a social survey was carried out
during project preparation, no follow-up survey was carried out to identify which elements of
PRIP were more or less successful and why. Questions that might have been asked include:
Were any unresolved problems encountered during construction? Were the beneficiaries
consulted and were their views accommodated? Were residents along the road hired by the
contractors, to do what and how much did they earn? To what extent did transport services
develop and are they affordable? Informal interviews and other anecdotal information suggest
that the project roads met the needs of the population served, but such information cannot take
the place of systematic feedback over time. As the intention was to pilot the approach in the four
PRIP provinces and thereafter scale up to other provinces, such information could have informed



                                                 20
new projects and improve the prioritization, targeting and cost-effectiveness of the scaled-up
activities over time.

77.     Contextual constraints need to be identified and accommodated. The project sought
to strengthen the capacity of small to medium-sized contractors and thereby begin the process of
moving from force account to the contracting out of maintenance works. While the capacity
building elements of PRIP were defined and managed effectively, problems ensued that had
more to do with the contracting environment than the technical capacity of individual contractors.
The PAD and IFAPER both highlighted a pervasive lack of competitive bidding and
transparency in the award of Government-funded works contracts in Cambodia. They also
highlighted the lack of a well-defined legal framework within which contractual processes would
be carried out. Governance-related problems specific to PRIP arose from the number and size of
contracts, plus the inexperience of government ministries and their provincial departments with
international procurement standards. These problems were not unique to the road sector and
demonstrate the importance of understanding and addressing the broader context within which
project activities will necessarily unfold.

78.     For M&E frameworks to be useful, they have to employ indicators that are relevant
and useful to decision-makers. M&E frameworks can have many functions beyond the
documentation of achievements associated with a particular project. At one level they can focus
the attention of decision-makers on outcomes as opposed to completion of outputs. At another
they can inform planning and management decisions, e.g., to flag the need for additional capacity
or funding, to ensure expenditures provide value for money, to monitor construction quality and
durability, to locate “black spots? or unsafe areas, or to document vehicle overloading. The key
is to design M&E frameworks that not only meet the needs of the project, but also can support
and inform normal business requirements. Data must be easy to collect and analyze, and
progress on key indicators should be reported on at regular intervals.

79.    Lasting improvements in governance cannot be served by establishment of parallel
systems. The Bank-mandated outsourcing of procurement and works supervision to manage
corruption was at best ineffective and at worst counterproductive for the following reasons:

   a) The flip side of “independence? is lack of knowledge and/or understanding of local
      conditions; the IPA in particular needed the help of those he was supposed to replace in
      order to carry out his terms of reference; the first IPA failed to complete the procurement
      of any contract, and second IPA only after many delays;
   b) the outsourcing was merely a stop-gap measure that resulted in a loss of opportunity,
      experience and knowledge-exchange for individuals and groups that had not been part of
      the problem; it also caused resentment on the part of those whose authority and work had
      been supplanted but whose inputs were still required in order for the work to be carried
      out;
   c) the “learning by doing? approach that was central to the project design was compromised
      by the outsourcing requirement; this was unfortunate as capacity-building was
      fundamental to helping Cambodia move from emergency reconstruction to medium-term
      solutions; and


                                               21
      d) the other development partners involved in PRIP and parallel projects did not go along
         with the outsourcing requirements; as a result the implementing staff had to follow
         multiple sets of procedures, which gave rise to confusion and lower productivity.

7.        Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)       Borrower/implementing agencies

80.     Borrower’s ICR Summary: The Borrower provided a Summary of its ICR, which is
included Annex 7. The Borrower’s ICR expresses support for the project concept, with its focus
on rural transportation and capacity building. Key concerns pertained to (i) the outsourcing of
procurement to the IPA and of supervision to the Engineer, as these undercut the stated capacity
building aim of the project; (ii) the unrealistic targets set, especially for MRD, and failure to
adjust these until the final year of the project; (iii) the need to move from project-specific
training to human resource development in the Ministries; (iv) the fact that despite added
prominence brought by the project, road maintenance is not yet on a secure institutional basis in
either Ministry; and (v) the complexity and confusion arising from the inconsistent requirements
of the donors – IDA, ADB, AusAID – especially after the suspension was lifted. Lessons
learned are as follows:

         In applying short term measures to resolve a significant problem in implementation there
          is a need to consider the implications that these measures may have on the long term
          objectives and strategy of the project.
         Actual rehabilitation costs of tertiary roads at the time of loan approval should have been

81.     Borrower Comments on draft ICR: Both MEF and MPWT indicated that they had
reviewed the Bank’s draft ICR and had no comments. MRD noted that it had received
insufficient notification and guidance from the Bank (or from the financial auditors) regarding
the portion of the Credit to be refunded as a result of the misprocurement; and, as other donors
are more flexible and accommodating, urged the Bank also to be more flexible in policies and
procedures when preparing new projects.

                               Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Maintenance Management

The maintenance management component was to: (a) support installation and operation of road
maintenance management systems (RMMS) at the national level of MPWT and MRD, and their
respective provincial departments; and (b) carry out annual programs of routine maintenance on
maintainable roads. With respect to (a), RMMS are still under development in both ministries,
with much of the focus on collection of basic data. MPWT has the Location Referencing and
Condition Survey (LCRS) of its entire network, but the data are not being updated
systematically. The LCRS was intended to feed into MPWT’s Road Management Decision
Support System (RMDS), but for various reasons the system is not being used. MRD is
currently working on an inventory of all rural roads under its jurisdiction. A road management
system for rural roads, ROMAPS, was developed by a consulting firm under a PHRD grant;
however the system is proprietary and MRD lacks the money to pay servicing fees. Instead,
MRD is working to develop a simplified system of its own based on ACCESS (Microsoft
Office). At project end, the systems were not being used to prepare prioritized maintenance
plans. Further development of the road asset management system of MPWT is being pursued
under RAMP.

With respect to (b), the appraisal target for MPWT was to routinely maintain 300 km of roads in
the four provinces. This target was exceeded by about 150%, and by project end MPWT was
routinely maintaining about half of the national and provincial roads in the four project provinces
(about 735 km out of 1639) on an annual basis. MRD’s appraisal target of 300 km was exceeded
by about 100%, and by project end, MRD was maintaining about 602 km of tertiary roads, out of
about 800 roads under its responsibility in the four provinces, annually.

Component 2: Rehabilitation and Periodic Maintenance.

The first and second civil works programs were completed in 2007 and 2011, respectively. By
the end of the project MPWT had rehabilitated 263.4 km of secondary national and provincial
roads, or 88 percent of the original target of 300 km. In addition, MPWT had constructed six
wooden, bridges on PR 210 (now NR 64), five concrete bridges and one bailey bridge on PR 213
(funded by RGC under PRIP).

By the end of the project MRD had rehabilitated 84 km of rural roads, or about 29 percent of the
original target of 300 km, plus two bridges, two causeways and many culverts. Specific
achievements are as follows:
          In Kampong Thom Province, 17 km of laterite road sections were rehabilitated from
           Salavisay commune to Stoung District which now provides a connection of 39 km of
           rehabilitated road section funded by the government, with access to NR 6;
          In Preah Vihear Province, the Svaypat to Sdao road was rehabilitated using funds
           from both the IDA and the Government: the first section of SBST road (8 km) was
           built using IDA funds; and the second section of 18 km of road linking Sdao
           commune, was rehabilitated by the Government. In addition, 26 km of road section
           was rehabilitated with RGC funds to link Prast Brakhan ancient temple to Sangkom


                                               24
           Thmei District. In total, 52 km of road were rehabilitated to link NR64 and the
           ancient temple.
          In Siem Reap Province, one section of SBST road (29 km) from Angkor Chum to
           Varin; and 12 km of laterite road near Popel - Sophy village were rehabilitated (year
           2 program), providing a link to NR 6 and access to Siem Reap city and other towns.
          In Oddar Meanchey Province, 13 km of SBST road were rehabilitated (year 1
           program), providing easy access to Siem Thmor District and Oddar Meanchey
           provincial town via the 48 km of road built by the Visvakam (the military engineering
           force). An additional 5.5 km of laterite road were rehabilitated (year 2 program) from
           Prasat Lbaeuk to Prasat.

Component 3: Capacity Building in MPWT and MRD

Various training modalities were used to carry out the capacity building in the two ministries:
training at school (English language, computers, etc.); short courses around particular technical
topics (road design, quality control, road asset management, labor-based training and
management, environmental and resettlement monitoring, cultural heritage, road safety, financial
management, procurement, good governance website development); workshops; training of
trainers (especially for environmental safeguards and contractor training); learning by doing
(theory learning and application on site); and study tours. In total, the project contributed to
training of about 450 staff from MPWT and 215 staff from MRD in various sectors, plus a
number of community representatives (who were organized to supervise the works in their
areas). The training was not restricted to the four provinces; representatives of all provinces
were invited, as well as others who had a role in roads and/or traffic management, including the
police.

Component 4: Policy and Strategy Development (US$0.20 million)

This component comprised five sub-components: (i) integrated planning and budgeting of roads;
(ii) least cost life-cycle standards; (iii) use of appropriate technology; (iv) mainstreaming of road
maintenance; and (v) institutional reform. Both MPWT and MRD have undertaken the
following reforms that are increasing their efficiency:
           a. Integrated planning and budgeting: The project contributed to the development
              of a three year rolling program for public investment and to train many staff of the
              two ministries in planning and budgeting. As a result, the planning and budgeting
              have improved, but plans and budgets are still prepared manually.

           b. Least cost life-cycle standards: All project roads were selected using cost and
              benefit or cost effectiveness analysis based on road traffic volume, and social and
              environmental safeguards impact. Beneficiaries were involved in the selection of
              all roads.

           c. Use of appropriate technology: Labor-based appropriate technology (LBAT) was
              introduced by the project (training was provided to some contractors) but the
              approach was not used beyond the introduction, as road standards were increased


                                                25
              to a level where LBAT was less suitable. Reportedly there also were few
              villagers interested in carrying out the work during the rainy season.

          d. Mainstreaming of road maintenance: The budget allocated for both periodic and
             routine maintenance (MPWT and MRD maintenance programs) increased
             annually.

          e. Institutional reform: A key aspect of institutional reform carried out under the
             project entailed the implementation of the government’s decentralization and
             deconcentration policy. While the Provincial departments already had some
             capacity to prepare work plans and budgets, the project provided the opportunity
             for them to receive procurement and financial management training based on
             World Bank/international guidelines. Under PRIP, MPWT also established a
             Social and Environmental Unit, which prepared uniform standards and forms.
             Two publications -- Final Standard Guidelines for Implementation of Social
             Safeguards and Final Standard Guidelines for Environmental Safeguards -- were
             finalized in 2009-2010 and made available in Khmer and English. In addition, a
             Financial Management Standard for the Ministry was prepared and rolled out
             under the project (2009).

Component 5: Community Awareness Programs. The awareness activities and community
participation were fully implemented by PRIP. The following activities were supplemented by
Bank supervision of social safeguards and by training and other capacity building activites
carried out in the course of the project:

      Road Safety Awareness Program: In anticipation of greater traffic volumes and speeds,
       MPWT and MRD organized community awareness meetings and workshops for their
       staff and for the communities living along the roads of the project. These focused on tips
       and measures to ensure the safety of children and livestock and to prevent accidents. To
       design and implement the “Road Safety Law?, MPWT and MRD worked closely in
       organizing and carrying out various forums and campaigns.

      HIV/AIDS Awareness Program: The HIV/AIDS awareness program was implemented
       through the civil works contracts. More than 15,000 people from local communities were
       educated on preventive measures regarding HIV/AIDS.

      Mines and Unexploded Ordnance Risk and Clearance Awareness Program: This activity
       was fully completed during the implementation of the first year civil works program. No
       accidents were reported during project implementation.

                          Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

As indicated in the main text, an important feature of the project design was that all candidate
roads for rehabilitation and periodic maintenance were subject to economic analysis. The
selection of road sections for the project was based on a consultative process that was further
confirmed by either a cost-benefit analysis for the higher volume roads or a screening process
and cost-effectiveness analysis for periodic maintenance of low volume rural roads. A
beneficiary survey was also carried out during preparation, the main results of which are
summarized in Annex 5. Unfortunately the survey was not repeated at the conclusion of the
project, but anecdotal evidence confirms the anticipated improvements in livelihoods (Annex 10).

Methodology and Assumptions

Screening and Prioritization of PRIP Roads. Facilitated workshops were held in the four
provinces, in which participants were asked to screen and prioritize the roads in their area on the
basis of the following criteria: accessibility, population served, environmental impact, economic
impact, availability of local resources and tourism potential. An inter-provincial workshop was
then held to combine these results and select a tentative Phase 1 program. Detailed engineering
surveys and economic analyses were then carried out for the proposed Phase 1 roads.

Analytical Inputs. For the detailed analyses of roads under consideration for the Phase 1
rehabilitation and improvement program, road works costs were estimated in financial and
economic terms (net of taxes), with economic costs in the order of 85 percent of financial cost.
Fleet and road user costs were based on a survey from 2001 under the ILO Upstream Project,
updated in Siem Reap Province in December 2002 for PRIP. Typical economic unit road user
costs, in US$ per 1000 vehicle-km, were developed for different classes of vehicles and
roughness levels (IRI).

For each road under consideration for rehabilitation or improvement in Phase 1, traffic counts
and origin-destination surveys were carried out as follows: a one-week day-time traffic count
and origin-destination survey for secondary national and provincial roads and a three-day count
for tertiary roads. A smaller sample of nighttime counts was also taken, which suggested
nighttime volumes of around 10 percent of daytime traffic levels. Traffic growth rates were
based on recent trends by vehicle type. For Siem Reap and Kampong Thom Provinces, the
traffic growth rate was considered to vary per vehicle type between 5 and 7 percent for the first
five years, 3 to 5 percent for years 6 to 10, and 2 to 3 percent thereafter. For Oddar Meanchey
and Preah Vihear provinces, the traffic growth rate was considered to fall between 2 and 6
percent for the first 5 years, and 1 to 3 percent thereafter.

Scenarios. All of the roads considered for the Phase 1 rehabilitation and improvement program
were unpaved and in poor condition (pictures in Annex 11). The economic evaluation compared
a without project alternative with up to three rehabilitation or improvement project alternatives.
The main costs included the cost of the civil works and periodic maintenance over the life of the
road. The main benefits were directly related to traffic, including savings in vehicle operating
costs, and savings in vehicle and passenger and time costs. The economic analysis took into
account a construction period of one year, evaluation period of 15 years, cut-off Economic Rate



                                               27
of Return (ERR) for inclusion in the project of 12 percent and discount rate of 12 percent. The
NPVs of the project first year rehabilitation works amounted to US$14 million and ERR of 35
percent. The NPV of the first year periodic maintenance works amounted to US$0.42 million
and ERR of 28 percent. The latter roads exhibited a cost-effectiveness ratio of about US$11 per
person; however this was based on the very low per km cost associated with inadequate and/or
incomplete designs.

Ex-anti Economic Analysis

Quantifiable benefits. The ex-anti analysis updated estimated construction costs with actual
costs and made certain assumptions about traffic volumes and types of traffic. Current (year
2011) traffic counts were available for only two of the MPWT roads (NR 65 and NR 71). These
counts showed traffic levels that were approximately equal or somewhat lower than those
assumed at appraisal. However as overall trends show substantial increases in traffic volumes
throughout Cambodia – including these provinces – it is likely that the counts were incomplete
and/or influenced by the count location. For MRD roads, traffic counts were taken shortly after
completion of each road. These show levels of traffic growth that were higher than expected,
with increases of 45 percent in Oddar Meanchey Province, 186 percent in Preah Vihear Province,
352 percent in Siem Reap Province and 358 percent in Kampong Thom Province. The counts
include non-motorized and motorized vehicles, with the highest growth in numbers of motor
cycles. As the roads were barely passable, if at all, prior to improvement, high levels of traffic
growth are reasonable.

A comparison of costs, NPVs and ERRs for Phase 1 roads at appraisal and at project close is
shown in Table, 3.1 below. For MPWT, six road links yielded a range of NPVs from US$0.025
million to US$8.8 million and ERRs of between 15 percent and 21 percent. These comply with
the selection criteria and fall within the same general range as the original estimates for the same
roads. The MPWT roads remain economically viable despite the somewhat lower traffic
volumes. For MRD, the ex-ante NPVs range from 0.19 to 1.95 million and ERRs between 19
percent and above 50 percent, and also comply with the selection criteria.

 Non-quantifiable benefits. Non-quantifiable benefits include social benefits arising from better
 access to schools, medical facilities and other social services, employment and markets. The
 importance of these benefits was highlighted in the Social Assessment conducted during
 preparation (See Annex 5 for a description of the survey design and key characteristics of the
 population served). Although a follow-up survey was not carried out at the end of the project,
 informal visits to some of the same areas confirm that the expected positive benefits were
 realized. These discussions are summarized as follows:

           Angkor Chum to Varin Road - Svay Sar Commune. Before the road was improved,
            travel time to town was three hours and cost R 50,000; now travel time is 30 minutes and
            costs R 10,000. Before the road was improved, rice growers had to bring rice to the
            market, at a cost of R 500/kg; now the rice broker comes to the village and pays R
            1200/kg. Before, no cassava was grown because there were no buyers; now there are
            large cassava farms. Before, patients had to be transported to the hospital; now an
            ambulance will come to the patient. Before, villagers could only travel in daylight; now
            that the mines have been cleared, it is safe to travel after dark.



                                                             29
   Angkor Chum to Varin - Charchhouk Commune . Before the road was improved, travel
    time to town was three hours and cost R 10,000; now travel time is one hour and costs R
    7,000. Now they can sell rice, watermelons, beans and cassava. But there is too much
    traffic. One resident says sleep is interrupted by traffic noise, and there have been
    accidents (12 in 2011 and 9 in 2010. Even with the road, problems remain with drainage,
    culverts, and they need irrigation systems for agriculture.

   Road PR 213 - Reakreay Commune. Before the road was improved, travel time from
    commune to village was one hour or more and cost R 30,000; now travel time is less than
    half an hour and costs R 10,000. Before, no middleman would come to the village to buy
    rice; now the middleman comes and pays R 1200/km. Before the villagers relied on
    traditional medicine to help each other; now they can visit health clinics when sick.
    Before the school drop-out rate was high after 4th grade (the village school only went to
    4th grade); now they have a secondary school and school attendance is high. But traffic
    accidents are now a problem, due to high speeds and drunk driving; in one month there
    were four accidents.

   Road NR 71: The road condition was extremely poor before the project due to heavy
    truck traffic from NR 7. After the road was improved, residents experienced a reduction
    in the cost of transport to NR6 from R 5,000 to R 1,500. Access to markets, health
    centers and schools significantly improved, but now traffic has increased. Residents
    noted that road safety has become a concern.

   Road PR 181. The earth road was impassable even during the dry season. A four hour
    walk was required to reach the District center of Samrong. Children could not get to
    school; people died trying to reach a health center; and crops spoiled before they could be
    sold at market. When motorcycle transportation was available, the cost was 20,000 Riels.
    After the road was improved, the cost dropped to 2,000 Riel. Girls now go to school,
    patients can get to the hospital and maternal care in particular has improved. Crops can
    be sold at market and supplies brought into the area at much lower cost.

   Road PR 207. The road, which serves 13,000 people, leads to the Tonle Sap River. The
    road was in poor condition because of heavy truck traffic from NR 6, and travel speeds
    did not exceed 20 km/hr even during the dry season. After the road was improved, traffic
    increased and access to markets, clinics and schools is much improved. However the
    final section of the road to the Commune Center, which would serve about 10,000 people,
    is still not passable in the wet season. People have to transfer to boats to reach the
    Commune Center during the rainy season.

   Salavisai to Stoung. The road, which serves about 2000 people, passes through two
    communes. Before improvement, only animal cart transport was possible. After the road
    was improved, the cost to Kampong Thoms dropped from 35,000 to 2-3,000 Riel.
    Access to markets, schools, clinics and the hospital improved, and traders and NGOs are
    now coming into the area. School attendance has increased, especially for girls.
    Population growth of 25 percent along the road reportedly has caused disputes in a few
    local areas.


                                           30
   Svaypat to Sdou. The road, which serves about 4000 people, passes through three
    communes. Prior to construction it took two days to reach the District center, now a few
    hours. Transport cost has dropped from 40,000 to 15,000 Riel. Traffic volume has
    increased from no traffic to 40-50 vehicles per day. The road provides access to markets,
    and incoming agricultural services as well. A secondary school has opened in the
    commune, made possible in part by the road.

                            Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

A well designed Social Assessment Survey was carried out during project preparation, but as
indicated in Annex 3, was not repeated after the project to compare results. Informal interviews
and anecdotal information confirm that the anticipated improvements from all-weather road
access were realized.

Overall survey design. The beneficiary survey included a review of secondary data, face-to-face
interviews of randomly selected households in 29 (out of 81) villages located along the Phase 1
roads, and a participatory rural appraisal (open-ended group discussions). The latter sought to
identify the balance of trade in and out of the villages, a women’s map showing the amount of
time women spent on essential daily and weekly activities, and a seasonal calendar around
dimensions such as road access, food and income shortage, and human and animal wealth. The
survey also interviewed representatives of the Kuoy people, an ethnic minority in Preah Vihear
Province.

Household Survey. The demographic characteristics of the 370 householders interviewed were
as follows:

      56 percent were women and 44 percent men;
      96.5 percent were Khmer, 3.2 percent Kuoy, and 0.3 percent Chinese;
      Average household size was 5.9 persons;
      1,684 children were born to respondents but 12.7 percent had died;
      87 percent were married monogamously, 3.2 percent polygamously, 8.6 percent widowed,
       1.1 percent divorced;
      75 percent of households were headed by males; 25 percent were headed by females;
      female-headed households had younger members, with 48.2 percent under 14 years
       compared to the average household with 41.2 percent under 14 years;
      female-headed households were more vulnerable, with less education, smaller land
       parcels, and most below the poverty line;
      most households owned their land, but 89 percent owned less than one hectare;
      less than 20 percent had land titles (the cost of the title was beyond the means of most
       households);
      less than half of households used fertilizer; 4 percent used insecticides.

All villages were fairly isolated, with roads in disrepair. People reported they had great
difficulty traveling, particularly in the rainy season. They also noted that motorized transport
modes ventured into their areas only infrequently. Table A5.1 shows transport modes and travel
frequency reported by survey residents. Bicycles and motorcycles were used most frequently
throughout the year. Cars, buses and pick-up trucks were used infrequently, more often on a
yearly basis. Horse-cart transportation was used in specific areas of Stoung and Baray in
Kampong Thom Province.

Respondents voiced the following views about the negative impacts associated with the lack of
roads:
    Limited access to prenatal and health clinics had increased child mortality rates from
       malaria, malnutrition, mine-related injuries and unknown causes;
    Lack of access to jobs during the rainy season impeded non-farm job opportunities;
    Education levels were low because neither teachers nor students could reach some areas;
    “Alternative income? from sale of surplus vegetables, fishing, trading and cottage
       industry, was limited by lack of access.

The PRIP was designed as a 3 year project. It started in 2004. For various reasons it developed
into a 7 year project covering three clearly defined phases. The overall policy context within
which the PRIP was designed has changed surprisingly little.

The PRIP was conceived as responding to both the RGC’s key concerns as expressed in the
National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) but also to the objectives of the CAS. In particular
it supported two key objectives of the CAS which were (i) to support the formulation and
implementation of a government-led strategy and corresponding investment programme for
reducing poverty and achieving the Cambodia MDGs and (ii) to support with analytical and
investment services those under-funded sectors and sub-sectors critical to achieving the
Cambodia Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

The benefits of the PRIP were seen as being those of the improvement of rural transportation.
This was both in relation to the reduction of travel costs and time but also in significant
improvements in access to markets, education, information and health. The rehabilitation of the
roads was also expected to provide both skilled and unskilled employment. The target
beneficiaries were the whole population of the four Provinces.

The original detailed indicators, identified for each component of the PRIP, were modified and
severely simplified in March 2011. It was felt that some of the original indicators required data
that was difficult to obtain. Moreover some of the indicators related to the overall economic and
social development which it would be difficult to ascribe to the roads only.

The first phase of the PRIP covered the period from mid 2004 to mid 2006. During this time
work was concentrated on the implementation of the so called 1st year plan. In 2006, the project
was suspended by the World Bank for 8 months since the World Bank declared that 6 civil
works contracts were mis-procured and various measures were introduced at the behest of the
World Bank. A good governance framework was developed for the project and an Action Plan
established. An International Procurement Adviser (IPA) - Crown Agents - was recruited.
Responsibility for project procurement activities was taken away from the two implementing
agencies and passed to the IPA. A Contract Supervision Consultant was recruited to inspect the
quality of the civil works and to approve payments. This responsibility had previously been with
the MPWT and the MRD who had delegated this responsibility to their provincial offices. In
addition a Technical Audit was included in the project activities.

The second phase of the PRIP covered the period from the suspension of the project in June 2006
until September 2010. Actual implementation of civil works halted in mid 2006 and did not
restart until September 2010.

For the final phase between 2010 and the end of 2011, the project was restructured. This
involved the redefinition of target indicators, the development of more effective procedures and
the implementation of civil works which were both complementary and supplementary to the 1st
year programme.



                                              37
Key factors affecting implementation and outcomes

The fact that the project was halted after two years of implementation and then required a period
of a further three years before civil works implementation was resumed clearly had a major
impact. The outsourcing of procurement was one of the measures included in the action plan set
out by the World Bank to raise the suspension. This was a contentious decision. Clearly the Bank
felt that the mis-procurement was of such a nature that the two implementing agencies could not,
with any confidence, be left with the responsibility. Nevertheless, this was in contradiction of the
Bank’s stated aim in the PAD to develop the capacity of the MRD, MPWT and its provincial
offices to procure civil works.

A further measure was to outsource the supervision of works. The original supervision
consultants were hired to advise the two ministries and their provincial offices. After the
suspension international consultants were hired to act as the Engineer and take responsibility for
the supervision of the civil works.

A further key factor affecting implementation was related to the targets set in the PAD for the
PRIP. In relation to the MPWT these targets were reasonable. For the MRD, the 1st year
programme costs demonstrated that the target figure was inappropriate. Nevertheless the target
figure for the programme of the MRD was retained until the restructuring of the project in 2010.
MRD were in a position of aiming for a target that was unachievable.

Assessment of Outcomes

For Component 1. The target was the mainstreaming of a management system and routine
maintenance being implemented. MPWT has managed to set up a system. However, the data
have not been updated and the system is not being used to its full potential for preparing annual
maintenance programmes and multi-year road expenditure plans. This is now being implemented
under the Rural Access Management Project (RAMP) project. A major component of the RAMP
is focused on the full development of MPWT’s road management processes, systems and staff
capacity in order to undertake an effective road asset management programme.

The MRD is using an Excel based programme as a planning tool, but this is not capable of
dealing with the entirety of a rural road maintenance management system. MRD has attempted to
adapt the ROMAPs system. This system is currently being used by the Rural Infrastructure
Project of the MRD. The ownership of this system is held by a firm of consultants. The
ROMAPs system is expensive. MRD are not in a position to finance this. So far, therefore, the
MRD has been unable to fully develop an effective maintenance management system.

For Component 2. The targets for roads to be either rehabilitated or improved by periodic
maintenance as set out in the restructuring plan in 2010 have been largely met. The overall
condition of the target roads – secondary national, provincial and tertiary – in Cambodia at the
start of the project was generally poor. The majority were impassable in the rainy season. This
applied equally in the four PRIP Provinces. The roads have had a major impact in terms of
increasing access, reducing travel time and costs and providing connectivity to the higher levels
of roads.



                                                38
The results of the economic re-evaluation confirm that the First Year Works Programme
(FYWP) proposed was economically viable. They further confirm the selection of the FYWP as
a priority project within the RGC’s transport sector investment strategy. As no base line socio
economic base line is available, the non quantifiable benefits can only be gauged by visual
inspection and discussion with the beneficiaries. However there is considerable evidence to
suggest that the economic and social benefits were significant.

For Component 3. A considerable amount of training has been carried out by both Ministries as
part of this capacity building component. Within the context of the PRIP this has no doubt been
effective. Within the context of developing the overall capacity of the Ministries the
effectiveness of the training is somewhat more difficult to evaluate. This is due to the general
lack of overall policy and strategy in relation to human resource development in the Ministries
and the tendency of external donors to finance training specifically in relation to, and uniquely
concerned with, specific projects.

For Component 4. In 2007 A Road Law was enacted which covered the activities of the
MPWT. Whilst not a road policy as such it represented a major step forward in defining the
regulatory framework for roads in the country. However a roads policy is still under
consideration. In MRD a rural roads strategy was developed in 2007. Based on this a policy has
been prepared and forwarded to the Council of Ministers, and is currently waiting for approval.

For component 5. The PAD assumed that the MRD would adopt the use of Labour Based
Appropriate Technology (LBAT) in the project. With hindsight a policy on LBAT adopted in the
late 1990s to use infrastructure as a means of creating employment was unlikely to withstand the
pressure on it from within technical ministries.

The HIV/AIDS programme focused on creating awareness and preventive measures among the
construction workers and the residents living along the roads. The training has been very
successful and has earned a reputation as one of the most effective programmes conducted so far
in the project.

Effectiveness

Whilst road maintenance is not yet on a secure institutional basis in either Ministry, the PRIP has
brought the issue into prominence and has ensured that the maintenance is recognized as a key
issue to safeguard the investments being made. In both Ministries serious effort is now being
made to fully operationalise road maintenance management systems.

The roads rehabilitated and periodically maintained by the PRIP were key elements of the road
network in the four Provinces. The secondary national roads that were part of the project
provided not only key links in the networks of the four Provinces but also ensured more effective
connectivity between contiguous provinces. The provincial and tertiary roads selected also
provided, in some cases for the first time, connectivity to the national network and to the
provincial capitals for the villagers along their length.




                                               39
It is difficult to measure the effectiveness of the capacity building programme. A mere listing of
courses and participants reached is not a measure of effectiveness. The problem is that there was
no comprehensive training needs assessment and little evaluation of the results of the training.
The fault for this should not be laid at the door of PRIP. It is more to do with the framework in
which the capacity building programmed was implemented.

The road sector needs an overall policy and both MPWT and MRD are in the process of
establishing this. However given the obvious gap it is surprising that additional support was not
provided to the PRIP to assist both the MPWT and the MRD in this regard.

The PRIP was extremely effective in improving the livelihoods of the rural population along the
roads in the project. This conclusion is based not on the evidence of statistics. This evidence,
unfortunately, is not possible because, although a baseline survey (actually named a social
assessment) was carried out, no follow up impact study was carried out.

Evidence derived from discussions with the commune councils and village chiefs along the roads
in the project indicates that travel time and cost was reduced, produce was able to access the
market, access for children to schools was easier, particularly for girls, and improved access to
health centres and hospitals has reduced the risk of death and long term effects of treatable
diseases and accidents.

The suspension of the project in 2006 however had serious repercussions on the project.
The most positive aspect was that a Good Governance Framework (GGF) and Action Plan were
established and this has become embedded in the project and to some extent in the institutional
culture of the two ministries. Less positive was the fact that the responsibility for procurement
was taken away from the Ministries and put in the hands of an International Procurement Agency
(IPA). This created resentment on the part of the Ministries. It also raised questions of World
Bank’s commitment to developing the capacity of the Ministries.

The second measure was to employ a supervision consultant whose responsibility was to act as
the Engineer vis a vis the contractors. The argument in favour was that an independent Engineer
would be more likely to be objective. The argument against was the same as for the IPA except
that the resentment and lack of capacity building now applied also to the provincial departments
of the two ministries.

The suspension of the project in 2006 for mis-procurement lead to short term measure being
taken which were not necessarily in accordance with the overall objective.

The outsourcing of responsibility for procurement has had repercussions for the RAMP project.
This is funded by three agencies – the World Bank, the ADB and AusAid. The World Bank
component will be procured by an IPA whilst the ADB and AusAid components will be
procured through the MPWT procedures with the support of a procurement adviser financed by
the ADB. This split of responsibilities within one project cannot be in the best interests of either
the smooth implementation of the project nor of capacity building of the MPWT.




                                                40
The treatment of safeguard issues in the project was appropriate for Cambodian conditions and
the types of interventions included in the project. Since most of the project components were
rehabilitation works within the existing rights-of-way, no significant impact on the physical
environment was expected.

Risk to the development outcome

The main risk to the development outcome is the lack of funding for the maintenance of the
improved roads. This would reduce the level of access of the rural population and the benefits
provided by the project would be lost. As these roads were assessed as being those which would
be of most value to the rural population, they should appear as priorities in the maintenance plans
of the province. However this is not guaranteed as the systems for maintenance planning are not
fully operational.

WB and Borrower performance

The World Bank conducted regular supervision missions, averaging two missions per year, with
an appropriate skill mix. Most missions made field visits and were able to provide technical and
other advice to resolve issues based on actual conditions.

In the special circumstance of the suspension of the project from June 2006, the World Bank
acted quickly to ensure that the project could restart with the requisite safeguards and action in
place by February 2007.

The Borrower also reacted quickly to the suspension of the project. It set up a committee to
investigate the allegations of corruption.

The restructuring of the project was part of the process of ensuring that the extension of the
project from 2010 to 2011. There was resistance to this both from the MEF and the World Bank.
Compliments are therefore due to the World Bank task team leader for believing in the capacity
and capability of the two Ministries to complete the project. In addition the management in the
MPWT as well as that in MRD deserve praise for the achievements produced in the final year of
the project.

Lessons learned

      In applying short term measures to resolve a significant problem in implementation there
       is a need to consider the implications that these measures may have on the long term
       objectives and strategy of the project.
      Actual rehabilitation costs of tertiary roads at the time of loan approval should have been
       more thoroughly researched.
      The LogFrame (or Key Performance Indicators table) should be modified when changes
       are made to outcome and outputs.
      In a country where proficiency in English is not common, important documents need to
       be translated into Khmer to avoid misunderstandings.
