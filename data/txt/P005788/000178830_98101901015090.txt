I. THE POWER SUBSECTOR
Historical Development
1.01     The development of the power subsector in the Yemen Arab Republic
(YAR) is a recent phenomenon. The installed generating capacity amounting to
only 2 MW in 1962 grew to 20 MW by 1974 and was divided among 21 small
independent utilities which, due to shortage of capital needed for expanding
their systems, were supplying power only to the centers of the main cities and
large towns. As a resuLt, the generation of electricity by industrial,
commercial, and private autoproducers and entrepreneurs became widespread.
Due to the absence of construction standards and the lack of expertise in the
field, the predominant characteristic of autogeneration is its poor quality.
1.02     In 1974, in an effort to organize the power subsector, the Government
assisted by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD) hired
two UK consulting firms; Power Development Consultants Limited to formulate a
feasibility study, and Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co. (PMM) to prepare a load
forecast, a power market survey report, and a power subsector organization and
procedures report. On PIlM's recommendation and in view of the inability of
the private sector to finance the largte investment required for the expansion
of the power subsector, the Government: by Decree Law 12/1975 created the Yemen
General Electricity Corporation (YGEC), to assume the responsibility for the
operations of private companies which were not able to expand and operate
their systems by acquiring them after providing equitable compensations. At
the time of its creation, YGEC's installed generating capacity totaled 15 MW,
the cumulative non-coincidental peak demand of its isolated systems was less
tnan 1I MW, and electricity sales to the 36,000 consumers it had inherited
amounted to 34 GWh.
1.03     In 1976, the Government embarked on a 5-Year Plan (1976-1980) aimed
at strengthening the inadequate physical infrastructure which was constraining
development of YAR. Accordingly, YGEC was to formulate a short-term
(1977-1980) and a long-term (1981-1995) expansion plan. The former involved
the installation of new generating facilities, interconnection of its isolated
systems, and rehabilitation and expansion of distribution systems in the main
cities and towns, and the latter was aimed at increasing access to public
electricity supply to 80% of the popuLation by 1998.
1.04     For the one year old YGEC, this was an impossible task.  In addition
to its sketchy organizational structure, the corporation was suffering from
acute shortage of funds and of qualified and experienced staff.
Consequently, the Government requested assistance from bilateral aid
agencies, IDA and international lending institutions to help develop the power
subsector.  In response to this request an IDA identification mission visited
YAR in 1976 which led to the first IDA power operation in 1978 (Power
Distribution Project, Credit 837-YAR).
1.05     In 1977, YGEC engaged Kennedy and Donkin (K&D), a UK consulting firm,
to formulate a least-cost program to year 1990 for the development of the
generation, transmission, and urban distribution systems. With funds provided
under Credit 837-YAR, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association



- 2 -
(NRECA), a US consulting firm, was engaged in 1980 to formulate a least-cost
National Electrification Program (NEP) to year 1995 for the development of the
rural distribution system. Expatriate staff was either provided by bilateral
aid agencies Overseas Development Administration (ODA), and French Cooperative
Program (FCP)), or was hired by YGEC.
1.06     With financial support provided by aid donors, international lending
institutions and the Government, and teclnical assistance proviided by
consultants and expatriate staff, YGEC managed in six years (1976-1982) to
increase its installed generating capacity by about eightfold (from 15 MW to
120 MW), the number of consumers by fourfold (from 36,000 to 133,000), and
electricity sales and system's peak demand by sixfold (from 34 to 200 GWh and
from 11 MW to 67 MW respectively). In spite of this spectacular growth, YGEC
was, and still is, unable to meet the demand for electrical power. The result
was a proliferation of private electric systems whose capacity, although not
known, is estimated to be of the order of 500 MW. 1/
Present Setting
1.07     At present, YGEC's system consists of 120 MW generating capacity,
660 km of transmission (132 kV) and subtransmission (33 kV) lines, and 4,660
km of medium voltage (15, 11 and 10 kV) and low voltage lines, and supplies
133,000 customers (Annexes 1.1 and 1.2). In 1979, YGEC initiated the
construction of the first steam power plant at Ras Katenib (RK) in the North
(5x33 MW), and the associated transmission lines that would interconnect
Hodeidah, Bajil, Dhamar, Sana'a, Amran, :[bb and Taiz. Intercornection of the
systema was originally scheduled for 1982--1983, but due to delays stemming from
YGEC's lack of experience in coordinating implementation of independent
projects, and factors outside the corporation's control, interconnection is
now projected for 1983-1984. Furthermore, YGEC decided to construct a second
steam power plant at Al Mukha (AM) in the South (4x40 MW) and a 132 kV
transmission line to interconnect the two steam power plants. The contract
for the construction of the plant at AM was awarded in late 1982 to Ansaldo
(Italy). Although the contract provided for the commissioning of the first
unit in 1985, considering the delays experienced in constructing RK,
commissioning of the first unit at AM may be delayed until early 1987, which,
according to the demand forecast, is the time YGEC's system would require
additional generating capacity.  Commissioning of the power stations at RK and
AM would increase YGEC's interconnected installed generating capacity from 66
MW in 1983 to 211 MW in 1984, to 312 MW in 1987, and to 385 MW in 1988. 2/
Commissioning of the AM plant (two units in 1977 and two in 1988) would, under
the present demand forecast, lead to one unit being in excess of demand for
about one year after the commissioning dates. However, the full capacity of
the plant would be required in meeting the system's demand, if industrial
consumers encouraged by the introduction of the new industrial tariff connect
to YGEC's network faster than at the projected rate. Details of YGEC's
isolated and interconnected system are given in Annexes 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and Map
IBRD No. 16910.
I/ These systems are equipped with diesel oil or kerosene driven generating
sets, ranging from 1 to 1,000 kW, ancL provide poor quality of power supply
at high cost to the consumer.
2/ By 1988 some old diesel units would be retired.



- 3 --
1.08     Of the 120 MW (in 1982) installed generating capacity, 78% (93 MW)
was installed in the cities of Sana'a, Hodeidah and Taiz, and the remaining
22% (27 MW) was dispersed around the country. Currently, only Hodeidah is
interconnected with the power plant at RK. By mid-1983 about 25% of Sana'a's
load would be fed from RK, and full interconnection of the main cities and
towns (para. 1.07) is anticipated to be completed by end-1984. However,
although all units of the plant at RK would be ready for commercial operation
by early 1984, at least one unit is not expected to be brought into daily
operation until about the end of 1985 due to inadequate distribution
facilities resulting from inadequate planning, financial constraints, and
delays in completing ongoing distribution projects (para. 2.01). 1/
Subsector Organization
1.09     The Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW) was established in 1981
by Law 26 to formulate policies and plans for the development of the power
subsector, and the development and exploitation of water resources in Yemen.
Controlling and licensing autogeneration have also come under the
responsibility of MEW's Technical Department. However, due to lack of
resources and the absence of coded standaLrds for electrical installations,
this control has not yet been exercised. Thus, private generation and
distribution systems are generally constructed to poor technical standards,
and when such facilities are taken over by YGEC they have to be replaced.
Since, in the medium term, private suppliers and small autoproducers are
likely to continue to account for a substantial portion of the electricity
subsector and the investments involved are sizable, there is a clear need for
optimizing resource allocation by reducing waste. Therefore, the Technical
Department of MEW would be strengthened in order to monitor autoproducers.
This Department would provide input to overall policy for the power subsector,
but in particular would be responsible for improving the technical standards
of private utilities, collecting information on private suppliers and
autoproducers, and licensing installations where private supply is
economically justified from the national view point, or where public supply
will not be available. To assist MEW in this task, funds would be made
available under the proposed Project for the preparation of simplified
construction standards for use by autoproducers. Autoproducers would be
encouraged to use these standards if they knew they would be remunerated if
YGEC could incorporate their systems in future grid extensions. Thus, the
Government has agreed to: (i) employ by March 31, 1984, consultants with
qualifications acceptable to the Association to prepare simplified
construction standards for low voltage systems, and upon completion of this
task (by about September 1984) consult with the Association on the
consultants' recommendations and conclusions, and in agreement with the
Association, initiate the implementation of a program to apply these
scandards; and (ii) by December 31, 1984, take all actions, including the
provision of sucn staff and other resources as the Government and the
Association shall consider necessary, to enable MEW's Technical Department to
regulate autogeneration and monitor the application of the prepared technical
standards. Preparation of standards would require the services of a
consultant for about 6 man-months at a cost of about US$12,500 per man-month
1/ More details regarding the energy sector and the power subsector could be
found in "The Power Subsector Review" Report No. 4314-YAR, 1983.

including staff salaries, social costs, firm's overhead and fee, overseas
allowance, and subsistance allowance. 'Che total cost for this assignment is
estimated at about US385,000, including the cost of printing in Arabic the
standards, drawings and illustrations required to have these standards
implemented by persons with average technical qualifications.
YGEC's Organization and Management
1.10     YGEC is managed by a Government-appointed Board of Directors and a
Management Committee. Policy making is the responsibility of the Board of
Directors which consists of a Chairman (the Minister of MEW), a Vice Chairman
(the Deputy Minister of MEW), and nine members.  The Management Committee
consisting of a Director General, a Deputy Director General and 12 members,
supported by central staff departments f'or planning, engineering, finance,
accounting and billing, personnel, procurement etc., prepares the plans of
activity and budgets which have to be approved by the Board of' Directors
before they are submitted for final approval to the Council of' Ministers.
l.lL     Operations are conducted through six decentralized regions and 27
branch offices. The regional managers who are members of the Management
Committee report to the Director General, while the branch offices report to
the regional managers. Although each region has its own technical,
administrative, accounting, billing, and purchasing department, all regions
depend on the head-office for support in system planning and project
preparation. Branch offices, on the other hand, depend on the regions for
support in construction and supply of materials, and major maintenance of
facilities. The existing organization structure leads to overstaffing and
needs to be restructured in line with YGEC's needs to serve its rapidly
increasing consumers better and to manage its huge investment program. YGEC's
management structure would be reviewed by management consultants provided
under the proposed Credit (para. 3.12). Details of YGEC's organizational
structure are given in Annexes 1.4 and 1.5.
YGEC's Manpower
1.12     Currently, YGEC has 2,060 employees of which 54 are expatriates, 52
are engineers, 728 administrative staff, 84 foremen, and the remaining 1,142
skilled and unskilled staff. Of YGEC's total staff, 215 are at the
head-office in Sana'a, and the remaining are divided among the regions as
follows: (i) Sana'a 714; (ii) Taiz 403; (iii) Hodeidah 407; (iv) Dhamar 185;
(v) Hajja 79; and (vi) Saadah 57.  The shortage of skilled and semiskilled
labor is one of the biggest development constraints in YAR.  Thus, since its
creation YGEC has been having staffing difficulties, which have led to great
dependence on consultants and a critical number of expatriate staff for the
nighly technical operational matters. Overall, the services provided by the
expatriates and the consulting firms are good, but they impose a rather heavy
financial burden on YGEC. However, taking into consideration the slow process
of training specialized staff, YGEC's dependence on expatriate expertise is
expected to continue for some years to come.
L.13     At present, the Corporation employs a disproportionately large number
of administrative, semiskilled and unskilLled staff as indicated by the volume
of electricity sales per employee (ratio of sales per employee is 97 MWh
compared to 184 MWh for Syria and 273 for Egypt). YGEC's low ratio of sales



per employee is a typical outcome of diseconomies of scale, which is
accentuated by the Corporation's need to provide on-the-job training by
assigning counterpart staff to contractors engaged in construction of various
facilities, the duplication of staff necessary to man the isolated systems,
the total dependence on manual practices for the preparation of electricity
bills, and the very low level of sales to industrial and commercial
enterprises. As YGEC's interconnected system evolves, sales to industrial
consulners increase, and computerized accounting and billing is introduced
(para. 3.20), staff reassignment will be undertaken. Thus, the ratio of sales
per employee will improve contributing towards the reduction of YGEC's
operating cost. However, it will take a few years before substantial cost
reduction is achieved.
Training
i..L4    To overcome the shortage of qualified personnel, YGEC introduced in
1976 a program for the training of various levels of managerial,
administrative and technical staff. Training was to take place, both abroad
and in Yemen. This program was supported by aid agencies and international
lending institutions. Training abroad had a slow start due to the difficulty
in identifying candidates possessing the required academic background. Up to
1979 only 17 persons were sent for technical training but in the last three
years, an additional 51 candidates have been sent for administrative and
tecnnical training. In addition, 23 staff members were sent to Italy for
training in the operation of the new steam power plant at RK. Training in
Yemen was also delayed till January 1, 1981, because no facilities were
available, and construction and manning of the training center at Dhahban
(suburb of Sana'a), financed by FCP and IDA, took a few years to complete.
Currently, the center provides training for 84 resident trainees per year.
The programs offered vary from 6 months to 3 years. In addition, the
facilities of the center are used for on-the-job training provided by
contractors who are constructing project facilities. This form of training is
proving to be more effective in meeting YGEC's immediate needs of skilled and
semiskilled staff. The proposed Project, therefore, includes a provision for
on-the-job training, while formal academic training in various disciplines
would be undertaken with funds already made available under existing loans
from AFESD.
Electricity Tariffs
1.15     YGEC is responsible for designing its own tariffs.  Tariff proposals
from YGEC have to be approved by the MEW, which in turn obtains the agreement
of the Cabinet. Currently, YGEC has two tariffs, one for sales in the urban
centers (Sana'a, Taiz, Hodeidah and Dhamar) and the other for sales to
consumers in rural areas. All customer categories in either urban or rural
areas are charged a uniform tariff irrespective of the kWhs consumed.
Presently the urban tariff is YRls 1.10/kWh (US$0.24/kWh) and the rural
YRls 1.50/kWh (US$0.33/kWh). In addition to the tariff, each new consumer
pays an initial connection charge, part of which is refundable upon
termination of electricity service. The level of connection charge depends on
tihe type of service provided and ranges from YRls 1,230 (YRls 830
nonrefundable, and 400 refundable deposit) for single phase supply, to YRls
4,030 (YRis 2,530 and YRls 1,500 respectively) for three phase supply for
commercial use.

1.16     Although YGEC's tariffs are higher than its long-run marginal cost
(LRMC) of supply (Power Subsector Review, Report No. 4314-YAR, 1983), their
level is not adequate to cover YGEC's operating expenses (para. 3.10).
However, tariffs are high by international comparison and the Government feels
that any further increase in tariffs is not politically feasible at this
time. Therefore, the only alternative for YGEC to meet its operating expenses
and achieve a reasonable return on its assets is the reduction, in real terms,
of tne cost of generating and distributing power. This would be achieved as
utilization of new and more efficient facilities increases, fuel cost per kWh
generated decreases in real terms (heavier emphasis on steam rather than on
diesel generation), sales grow at a faster rate than capital investment, and
losses in percentage terms and dependence on expatriate staff are reduced.
Since such reductions stem mainly from economies of scale, higher level of
utilization of existing plant, and institutional growth of the utility, they
can only be achieved over time, and it is projected that YGEC would not be
able to meet its operating expenses earlier than 1985, although some of the
above-mentioned savings would start materializing as soon as RK is
commissioned. However, in order to ensure that YGEC's revenues do not
deteriorate any further, the Government has agreed to maintain the level of
YGEC's tariffs existing as of October 31, 1982, except for the introduction of
new interim tariffs acceptable to the Association (para. 1.18).
1.17     YGEC's tariff structure and consumer classification need to be
improved. Both should be designed to ensure: (i) YGEC's financial viability;
and (ii) differentiation between consumers based on the cost incurred in
providing the service to each customer class. For this reason, under Credit
1102-YAR, Government agreed to the review of an earlier tariff study conducted
by British Electricity International Ltd. (BEI) on the basis of costs of
supply prevailing prior to the construction of the steam plant at RK. Review
of the study required the collection of additional data which was not readily
available, but a commercial adviser, financed by ODA, has reviewed BEI's study
including the formulation of a new tariff for industrial consumers. The first
draft of this study has been submitted for review to the Association and the
study would be finalized following a joint YGEC, IDA review presently
scheduled for late 1983.
L.i8     Any recommendations made by the above-mentioned study regarding the
structure of tariffs cannot be implemented until YGEC is equipped with the
necessary metering and billing facilities. Since this is projected to be
accomplished within the next 2 to 3 years, and since it is in the national
interest and YGEC's financial benefit to supply now to industrial
autoproducers power generated by the steam power plant at RK, the Government
is considering introducing for a period of about 3 years an industrial tariff
(with a constant price per KWh consumed) no less than YGEC's UIRMC and about
equal to the industrial autoproducers' variable cost of production (presently
estimated at about YRls 0.75/kWh), and an agricultural time of day tariff.
The Government and YGEC have agreed to exchange views with the Association on
the conclusions and recommendations of the tariff study, including the level
and timing of introducing an industrial and an agricultural tariff. YGEC has
further agreed to: (i) take all actions necessary to introduce tariffs
restructured on the basis of LRMC, in accordance with such implementation
plans, including timetables, as shall be satisfactory to the Association; and



- 7 -
(ii) employ by July 1, 1984, consultants to carry out a load research study
which would provide the basis for consumer classification. 1/ To assist YGEC
in this task, funds (US$75,000 for a lump sum contract) for technical
assistance would be made available under the proposed Credit.
Power System Planning
1.19     YGEC is responsible for planning the development of its system.
Although YGEC's ability in project identification has improved considerably
during the last two years, most planning and project preparation are carried
out by consultants. Proposed projects are approved by MEW which, in
consultation with the Central Planning Organization (CPO), formulates the
necessary project financing plans. Major decisions involving generation and
transmission are finalized by the Council of Ministers.
1.20     Since its creation, YGEC has undertaken a considerable number of
studies on generation, transmission, distribution, management, dispatching,
etc.  Each study invariably makes recommendations aimed at addressing the
issue at hand in isolation from other broader considerations, such as
financing and labor constraints.  For example, the ambitious generation
expansion program was not matched with a comparable distribution program
(para. 2.01). To remedy this deficienc:y which has led to unbalanced
investment decisions, YGEC has agreed to appoint by March 31, 1984 consultants
to: (i) review, update and consolidate into one study all recommendations
included in the existing studies; (ii) formulate a balanced system development
plan up to year 1993; (iii) produce cost estimates for implementing the
proposed plan; and (iv) prepare a manpower plan. Such a study would help YGEC
in optimizing its expansion program and in deriving medium term (3 to 5 years)
investment programs. In addition, the study would assist YGEC in formulating
its investment forecast which would enable the Government and the corporation
to pursue in a timely manner the necessary financing arrangements.  Completion
of the proposed study would require the services of a consultant for about 17
man-months, at a total cost of about US$218,000 (about US$12,500 per man-month
including staff salaries, social costs, firm's overhead and fee, overseas
allowance, and subsistance allowance) of which about US$162,000 would be in
foreign exchange.   Upon completion (about December 1984), the study would be
submitted to the Association for review, and on this basis YGEC would, in
consultation with the Government, prepare its future expansion program.
IDA Involvement in the Power Subsector
1.21     The proposed Project would be the third IDA operation in the power
subsector in YAR. The first Credit (Credit 837-YAR) in 1978, provided
US$10 million to cover part of the foreign exchange cost of a project
involving the rehabilitation of the distribution networks of Sana'a, Taiz and
Hodeidah, the training of YGEC's staff, a study by NRECA for the formulation
of the NEP and consultancy services. The Project was cofinanced by the
Netherlands, a buyer's credit from Hawker Siddeley of UK, the Government and
1/ This study is expected to be completed by about December 1984.



- 8 -
YGEC. Implementation of the Project has been slow because of difficulties
experienced by YGEC in securing the buyer's credit to complete the financing
package, and YGEC's lack of experience in procurement through ICB. Currently,
all contracts have been awarded, construction of Project faciLities has
started, and completion is projected by mid-1984, two and one half years
behind schedule. The second Credit (1102-YAR) in 1981 provided US112 million
to cover part of the foreign exchange cost of a Project involving the supply
of electricity service to 18 villages and the three principal farmers' markets
at the outskirts of the cities of Sana'a, Taiz and Hodeidah, an energy study
aimed at formulating a detailed strategy for phasing out the subsidies for
petroleum products, 1/ review of an earlier tariff study conducted by BEI
(para. 1.17), and on-the-job training of YGEC's staff. The Project was
cofinanced by the OPEC fund, the Government and YGEC. Currently, all
contracts have been awarded and construction of Project facilities has started
in March 1983, with completion anticipated in June 1984, six months behind
schedule. The delay is due to late arrival of materials which was caused by
the slowness of the National Bank of Yemen to open the letters of credit
associated with the supply contracts.
1.22     The above two Projects provided the opportunity for the Association
to engage in a meaningful dialogue with YGEC and the Government on the
proolems of the subsector, since the early years of YGEC's creation.  The main
thrust of both Credits was towards institution building and manpower
development. Consequently, YGEC's organizational structure was revised and a
clearer line of command was established; shortages in key operational
positions were identified and efforts were made to make available to YGEC
qualified staff to fill these positions; a system planning department and a
distribution department were established and steps to improve YGEC's project
identification and preparation were taken; a monitoring and data recording
system was initiated; a utility accounting system was established; a reporting
system was introduced; bidding procedures were set up and an inventory control
and stores management system was initiated; and training, both in Yemen and
abroad was initiated. In addition, general policy issues such as
rationalization of fuel prices and electricity tariff levels were addressed.
in all these fields progress was halting and uneven. However, IDA's first
involvement in the power subsector started when YGEC was only one year old,
YAR till mid-1970 was ravaged by a civil war, YAR has very limited financial
resources and continues to be one of the world's least developed countries,
and, last but not least, the labor force is drawn from a population pool which
is characterized by very low levels of education or training (in the 1970's
almost 9 out of 10 adults were illiterate). Against this background, it is
clear that YGEC has come a long way in the short period of five years and that
IDA's participation has contributed significantly towards the improvement of
the power subsector. However, much remains to be done and IDA's continued
involvement should continue to be beneficial in assisting YGEC's institutional
development. The proposed Project would further YGEC's institutional
development by providing suitable training, advisory asssistance, and help in
improving YGEC's planning and forecasting capabilities.
1/ After the Government's decision in 1981 to eliminate fuel subsidies in one
step (para. 3.09), this study was considered inappropriate and it was not
undertaken.

II. THE PROJECT
The Setting
2.01     Presently, about 33% of the population of YAR has access to
electricity service, but of this, only 9% is served by YGEC. Access to YGEC's
service in Sana'a, Taiz, Hodeidah, Dhamar, Ibb and Hajja is about 74% compared
to only 4% in the rest of the country. The relatively low access to YGEC's
service outside the cities and main towns persists because in the last five
years, YGEC invested heavily in generating and transmission facilities and
inadequately in distribution facilities. This is mainly due to YGEC's easier
access to funds for investments in power generation plants and transmission
lines than for distribution facilities, but weak planning also took its toll.
Thus, supply of electricity service in rural Yemen did not increase as fast as
desired, and substantial investment in distribution (about US3250 million over
the next 8 years) will be required to utilize available and committed
generating capacity. In light of an extensive dialogue with IDA about
sectoral programs and policies, 1/ the Government and YGEC have realized the
shortcomings of their investment decisions and intensive efforts are now being
made to secure funds for distribution projects. Apart from the proposed
Project, another distribution project at a total cost about US350 million was
appraised in late 1981 by the AFESD, and it is anticipated that this project
will be approved by its Board soon for procurement of equipment to take place
by mid-1983.
Project Objectives
2.02     The proposed Project is specifically aimed at meeting some of the
demand for electricity in rural areas, following up on the rehabilitation
program of Sana'a, Hodeidah and Taiz, and providing the necessary facilities
that would allow connection of industrial consumers to the national grid. It
would enable YGEC to increase its sales (revenues) by taking advantage of
existing excess generating and transmission capacity, achieve fuel savings by
supplying industrial customers with high demand that would otherwise use their
own generating facilities, and serve potential customers that are thinking of
generating their own electricity. The proposed Project, when completed, would
extend electricity service to about 15,500 new consumers (total beneficiaries
would be about 125,000 urban and rural inhabitants), upgrade the service
provided to about 4,500 existing urban customers, and provide the facilities
that would permnit connection of about 20 MW of industrial and commercial load
to the national grid.
Project Scope and Location
2.03     The proposed Project is a continuation of the effort initiated under
Credits 837-YAR and 1102-YAR and is aimed at implementing a second tranche of
the NEP (para. 1.05). It would extend electricity service to the
beneficiaries by:
1/ See "The Power Subsector Review" Report No. 4314-YAR, 1983.



- 10 -
(i) installing the distribution network in the areas of Badan, Al Misrakh
and Marawiah, and connecting them to the main grid;
(ii)  expanding the distribution network in the area of Bani Hushaysh which
would be connected to the grid with funds made available under Credit
1102-YAR;
(iii) rehabilitating, reinforcing and expanding the distribution networks
in the cities of Sana'a, Taiz and Hodeidah; and
(iv) constructing the subtransmission lines required to connect industrial
consumers situated in and around the cities of Sana'a, Taiz and
Hodeidaii.
The proposed Project is expected to be implemented over four years (1983-1986)
(see Annex 2.5).
Project Description
2.04      The proposed Project consists cf the supply, construction and
erection of about:
(i)  930 km of medium and low voltage lines;
(ii)  33 substations (total capacity 90 MVA);
(iii) 300 distribution transformers (total capacity 14 MVA);
(iv)  15,500 meters and Boards; and
(v)  1,300 streetlights.
In addition, the proposed Project would provide funds for:
(i)  instrumentation and technical assistance in conducting a load
research study;
(ii)  consulting services for Project engineering and construction
supervis ion;
(iii)  consulting services for the computerization of accounting and billing;
(iv)  consulting services for the formulation of YGEC's expansion and
investment program;
(v)  consulting services for the formulation of construction standards for
low voltage distribution systems;
(vi)  consulting services for the formulation and implementation of a
financial recovery plan; and
(vii) on-the-job training.
A detailed list of required materials is given in Annex 2.3.
Project Cost Estimates
2.05      The estimated cost of the proposed Project, including interest during
construction, is YRls 194.7 million (USS,42.9 million), of which YRls 142.3
million (US$31.4 million) would be in foreign exchange. The cost estimates do
not include customs duties and taxes from which YGEC is exempt. The breakdown
of the Project cost is summarized below while Annex 2.1 and 2.2 give the
yearly Project cost estimates.

2.06     The base cost estimates of the proposed Project -,re expressed in
terms of anticipated mid-1983 prices and were developed by NRECA and K&D based
on prices quoted on contracts for equipment and materials to be delivered on
December 1982. Physical contingencies of 10% are considered appropriate due
to the flexibility in covering a smaller or larger part of the target Project
areas. Annual price contingencies for the local cost components have been
calculated at 8% for 1983, 7% for 1984,and 6% for the period 1985-1986. For
the foreign cost components, price contingencies have been calculated at 8%
for 1983, 7.5% for 1984, 7.0% for 1985, and 6.0% for 1986. Interest during
construction has been calculated on the basis that only the IDA credit would
be relent to YGEC at 9% interest rate (see para. 3.18), while loans to be
secured from other cofinanciers along with Government's contribution toward
local costs will be made available to YGEC as Government's equity
contribution.
Project Financing
2.07     The proposed Credit of US$19 million would finance about 60% of the
foreign exchange cost of the Project (excluding interest during construction),
and the Islamic Bank, which has also appraised the proposed Project, has
agreed to contribute about 29% (SDR 8 miLlion, equivalent to about US$9
million).  The US83.4 million financing gap in foreign exchange would be met
by the Government (US$2.9 million) and by an existing loan (AFESD) which has a
provision (US30.5 million) for training YGEC's staff abroad. In addition to
the US$2.0 million from customers' contribution (connection charges), the
Government would provide the balance required (US$6.8 million) to close the
local cost financing gap. The financing plan for the project is summarized
below.

Status of Project Preparation
2.08     In addition to the study conducted by K&D for the development of the
generation, transmission, and urban distribution systems, and the NEP prepared
by NRECA (para 1.05), in 1981 YGEC engaged K&D to prepare a study covering the



- 13 -
supply of electricity at least cost to all towns and viable areas located
within 50 kilometers of either side of the main transmission line. These
studies have been reviewed by IDA and were found to be satisfactory. The
areas to be supplied with electricity service under the proposed Project, and
the project appraised by the AFESD (para 2.01), have been identified on the
basis of these studies. The proposed Project includes the areas ranked
highest (on the basis of economic rate of return) in NRECA's report, the
continuation of rehabilitation and expansion of the distribution systems of
Sana'a, Taiz, and Hodeidah (K&D's report), and the connection to the main grid
of industrial autoproducers situated in or near these cities.
2.09     Through Credits 837-YAR and 1102-YAR, an effort was made to
standardize materials, network designs, and procurement procedures (part of
K&D and NRECA's studies). Thus, the general conditions for tendering, the
technical specifications for materials and equipment, and the network designs
used under these Credits would be used for the proposed Project. The
materials required to implement the proposed Project have been estimated from
NRECA's and K&D's studies. However, the preliminary designs contained in
these studies need to be reviewed and developed, detailed designs need to be
updated, quantities of required materials and equipment have to be verified,
aad bidding documents need to be completed in order to enable execution of the
project to start as soon as possible after Credit approval. For this work,
and for completing the bidding process up to bid evaluation, YGEC will use K&D
for the urban component, and NRECA for the rural component. Both consulting
firms are currently in the field and are involved in the implementation of the
previous two IDA Credits. The total cost of these consultancy services is
about IJS8440,000 equivalent (i.e., for about 35 man-months at
LJS$12,500/man-month, which is the present average rate under the contract with
NRECA), of which about US$350,000 represents the foreign component cost. 1/
In order to ensure the timely implementation of the proposed Project, IDA:s
management has approved an advance of up to US3800,000 from the Project
Preparation Facility for the financing of the foreign exchange costs of the
above consultancy services up to Credit effectiveness. The Government would
be required to repay the advance with service charges accrued thereon through
withdrawals of the proceeds of the proposed Credit. In the event an IDA
Credit does not materialize by January 31, 1984, the Government would be
required to repay the advance and the accrued service charges on usual IDA
terms in equal installments over five years.
Construction Supervision
2.10     Although YGEC's capabilities have improved substantially in the last
five years, they are still inadequate for YGEC to supervise Project
construction. Thus, services for construction supervision would be required
in the proposed Project and it is estimated that such a contract would require
about 140 man-months at a total cost of about US$1,750,000 (at
US$12,500/man-month), of which about US$1,200,000 would be in foreign
exchange. In order to ensure timely appointment of these consultants, YGEC
has agreed to hire by January 1, 1984, consultants acceptable to the
1/ The foreign exchange component includes staff salaries, social costs,
firm's overhead and fee, and overseas allowance.



- 14 -
Association on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association for
construction supervision of facilities financed under the proposed Project.
In addition, this consultant would review the bid evaluation reports prepared
by K&D and NRECA, and would assist YGEC in the award of materi-als supply and
erection/installation contracts.
Project Implementation
2.11     Construction of the proposed Project would be undertaken by
contract. Given the pressing needs for training and the greater success
experienced with practical training, the engineering construction firm would
also provide on-the-job training to YGEC's staff. The total base cost of the
installation and erection contract is estimated at about US$13.6 million, of
which about US$7.8 million would be in foreign exchange.
2.12     In order to assist further in the technical and institutional
development of the Project Unit created in the distribution department of YGEC
under Credit 1102-YAR, ensure that adequate counterpart staff is provided to
the contractor, and-trainees are selected in a timely manner, the existing
Project Unit would also be responsible for coordinating and supervising all
activities associated with the proposed Project. Since the responsibilities
of the Project Unit would increase, YGEC has agreed to strengthen the Project
Unit with such facilities, powers, organization, and staffing as shall be
satisfactory to the Association.
Procurement
2.13     Since at least one co-financier would participate in the proposed
Project, the contracts associated with tlhe project have been divided into 13
groups in order to permit compliance with the procurement guidelines of this
co-financier and IDA (Annex 2.4). The groups involving the supply of
equipment and materials have been composed of elements which normally fall
within the production line of numerous manufacturers.  Division of contracts
between the co-financiers has not yet been determined, but on the assumption
that the Islamic Bank would finance the construction and erection contract for
the urban component of the proposed Project (contract 12a, Annesx 2.4), and two
equipment and materials contracts (Nos. 6 and 11), IDA would finance the
remaining contracts. After each co-financier decides on the components of the
proposed Project that would be covered by its loan, there might be a need for
consolidation of bid packages and changes in the list of contracts to be
financed by IDA. Nevertheless, and except as indicated below, contracts
financed under the proposed Credit, whether they relate to the supply of
equipment and materials, or, the erection and installation of project
facilities, would be let by international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank Group guidelines fo: Frocurement.  Procurement of small
quantities of standard distribution equipment and materials, not exceeding the
equivalent of US$50,000 per contract, and all contracts combin(ed the
equivalent of US$400,000, would be permitted to be procured through limited
international tendering procedures on the basis of evaluations and comparisons
of bids invited from a list of at least three qualified suppliers eligible
under the Bank group guidelines. All contracts to be financed from the
proceeds of the Credit, with the exception of those valued US$50,000 or less,
would be reviewed by IDA prior to award.



- 15 -
Disbursement
2.14     Disbursements from the proceeds of the proposed Credit against
contracts to be financed by IDA (para. 2.13) would be made for; (i) 100% of
the foreign cost of equipment and materials, construction and erection,
engineering and construction supervision, and consultancy and advisory
services; (ii) 100% of the local and foreign cost for the construction
standards study and technical assistance for the load research study; and
(iii) up to US3800,000 for repaying the advance and service charges accrued
thereon, made available from IDA's Project Preparation Facility. After the
contracts to be financed by IDA have been determined, there might be a need to
change the percentage of disbursements and to reallocate the proceeds of the
proposed Credit. The expected disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 2.6,
and the anticipated disbursement profile is shown in Annex 2.7. Disbursements
under the proposed Credit are anticipated to be faster than the historic
regional sectoral disbursements, and the Bank-wide subsectoral historic
disbursements. This is because the proposed project is a distribution
project, while both the regional sectoral and Bank-wide subsectoral profiles
include projects which normally have a longer gestation period (power
plants). In addition, the proposed Project is at a more advanced stage of
preparation than the previous two Projects financed by IDA and procedures,
which in the past have caused delays, have since been changed. June 30, 1987
would be the closing date for the proposed Credit.
Environmental Aspects
2.15     The Project has no adverse pollution effects on the environment.
Possible adverse aesthetic effects would be kept to a minimum by suitable
routing of overhead lines. The social environment will be enhanced by
bringing streetlighting to the residential areas affected, and by eliminating
the presently existing hazardous networks.
Risks
2.16     There are no major risks associated with this Project.  However,
possible risks that could have an adverse impact on the rate of return on the
Project relate to delays which may be experienced in implementing the Project,
and the uncertainty surrounding the industrial autoproducers' willingness to
connect to the national grid. To minimize delays, the causes of past delays
were discussed with the Government and YGEC. As a result, procedures followed
hitherto in opening Letters of Credit have been revised, and YGEC would
undertake henceforth to clear goods through customs. In addition, the Project
implementation schedule was formulated taking into consideration
correspondence delays experienced in the past, and delays in shipping goods to
YAR. With regards to the industrial consumers' willingness to connect to the
grid, an effort was made to sound their intentions.  From a representative
sample of industrialists that YGEC and IDA visited, it would appear that about
80% of them would connect to YGEC's supply provided the connection charges, as
proposed by YGEC, are reasonable. The cost of the necessary equipment and
materials to enable YGEC to extend its MV distribution system to the outskirts
of tne three main cities has been included in the proposed Project, and this
would substantially reduce the cost of the connections. It is therefore felt
that any impact on the return of the P'roject stemming from this risk would be
small.

III. FINANCE
Introduction
3.01      In the financial sphere, YGEC has shown considerable improvements
since 1977, when the first project in the power subsector was appraised.
Meaningful information about the Corporation's financial position was not
available at that time. Records either did not exist or were unreliable.
Billing and collection procedures were inadequate and inefficient; management
was inexperienced and staff were untrained and unable to cope effectively with
even day-to-day assignments. Since then, YGEC has installed a Utility
Accounting System developed by PMM which would form the basis for future
effective financial management. Furthernore, training of YGEC's key personnel
at headquaters and in the major regions has created a nucleus of people who
are capable of improving future operations. What remains to be done is to
extend the training program to all the Resgions and Branches and to include
YGEC's financial staff in this program so that the accounting system is
implemented properly. Further technical assistance through IDA's continued
involvement in the development of the power subsector and additional
management consulting services planned under the proposed credit (paras.
3.12-3.16 , Annex 3.1) would assist in putting YGEC's financia:L and accounting
work on a satisfactory basis.
Financial Department
3.02      In February 1982, YGEC's Board reorganized the Financial Department
in accordance with the governing laws (Law No. 12 of 1975, and 26 and 30 of
1981). The Department is now managed by the Financial Director, a young
Yemeni national, who is U.S. qualified but who lacks utility experience. The
Department, when fully organized, would include an Accounting Section, a Loan
Section and an Administrative and Cost Accounting Section. However,
presently, the Department has only an Accounting Section and a one-man Loan
Section.
3.03      YGEC has 27 branch offices reporting to six regional offices at
Sana'a, Hodeidah, Taiz, Dhamar, Hajja and Saadah. Each region has its own
financial and accounting division reporting to the Regional Manager. The
Financial Director at the Head Office in Sana'a does not have any supervisory
authority over the regions in respect of finance and accounting and yet, he
has the responsibility to consolidate the accounts and to present the profit
and loss account and a report on YGEC' s financial condition on a monthly basis
to the Management and to the Board.
3.04      The Financial Department at YGEC's Head Office, whose only operative
division is the Accounting Section, has become very weak after the departure
of the expatriate Financial Manager in 1981 and another expatriate accountant
in October 1982. It needs strengthening to be able to serve its rapidly
increasing consumers and to handle the capital expenditures of its huge
investment program. Also the Regions and the Branches are not staffed by
adequately qualified and trained people. The six regions have about 350 staff
in the Accounting Divisions, comprising accountants, meter readers and clerks,
of which only six are university graduates, and about fifty haves high school



- 17 -
education; the remaining staff whom YGEC inherited from various utilities it
acquired at its formation are unqualified. The one-man loan section of YGEC's
Financial Department at its Head Office does not have proper records of its
foreign loans and supplier credit transactions. Copies of the agreements
relating to YGEC's project loans and the subsidiary loan agreements between
the Government and YGEC, under which foreign loans are relent by the
Government to YGEC, are not available in YGEC's office.
3.05     YGEC's Financial Departments, both at the Head Office and at the
Regions, need to be reorganized to develop and implement appropriate changes
in tne organizational structure and operating procedures. The reorganization
should include, inter alia: (i) streamlining of operations; (ii) elimination
of some of the branches which have become redundant ; (iii) introduction of
fiscal discipline in branch operations; (iv) adequate cost control procedures;
(v) training of staff; and (vi) long-term manpower development plan. YGEC
would need external consultancy assistance to carry out such a
reorganization.  Proposed terms of reference to design and implement a
financial recovery plan (paras. 3.12-3.16 , Annex 3.1) include necessary
provisions for reorganizing the Financial Department.
Accounts
3.06     Although YGEC has a good utility accounting system established with
the assistance of PMM, because of the lack of experienced and qualified staff,
tne system is being administered very poorly. Some of the serious weaknesses
in YGEC's accounting work are the following:
(i) YGEC's books do not reflect the interest and amortization amounts
on its debt;
(ii)  Its books often do not reflect works performed under supplier
credits, resulting in the understatement of its assets;
(iii) The quality of its property accounting is poor, characterized by an
inaccurate determination of work in progress, completed works and
depreciation;
(iv)  YGEC's control of its regional and branch accounting work is very
poor, which frequently resuLts in non-reconciliation of accounts
with the regions leading both to inaccurate accounts and to delays
in their preparation;
(v) Revenues and expenses are not properly accrued, leading to
distortions on account of a previous year's adjustments being
recorded in a subsequent year;
(vi)  The cost and budgetary control procedures are inadequate;
(vii)  YGIC does not have a proper management information system to meet
management's needs;
(viii)  There is no system of internal audit; and
(ix)  inventory control and management are poor.



- 18 -
To remedy these deficiencies, external consultancy assistance would be
provided by the management consulting services planned under the proposed
Credit (para. 3.12-3.16, Annex 3.1).
Past Performance and Present Position
3.07    YGEC's actual income statements, balance sheets and funds statements
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1980, the six-month period ending December
31, 1980 ("transition period" between the old fiscal year ending June 30 of
each year and the new fiscal year which is the calendar year), and the fiscal
year ending December 31, 1981, and estimates for FY 1982 are included in
Annexes 3.3 through 3.5.  The audited financial statements of YGEC for FY 1980
and the six-month period ending December 31, 1980 indicate that the
Corporation earned rates of return of 3.:3% and 4.0% respectiveLy in these
periods. However, they were arrived at after arbitrarily capitalizing about
'Y5% of YGEC's Head Office expenses.  It appears that such allocations of
expenses to the capital account were based on the decision of YGEC's Board at
the time of budget approval and were not on the basis of any systematic
allocation of expenses in proportion to the time spent on capital projects and
revenue operations.  Without such capitaLization of a large portion of the
Head Office expenses, and with appropriate allocations of expenses to project
and revenue operations, YGEC would have shown operating losses in both
periods.  As regards 1981, after allowing for capitalization of about 20% of
the nead office expenses which YGEC could clearly justify, its power
operations are estimated to have suffered a loss of about YRls 21 million
before interest of YRls 38 million. In FY1982 the operating losses, before
interest, were estimated to be about YRls 9 million. In the past, the
Government has been servicing YGEC's debt: including payments due under
supplier Credits. However, from the current fiscal year YGEC would also
include in its annual budgets the requirements for its debt service
obligations. YGEC's liquidity was also poor in the past. At the end of FY
1979-1980 and the following six-month period, the current ratio was low at 0.6
and 0.7 respectively.  Its receivables on these dates were 80 and 136 days'
sales.  At the end of FY 1981, the receivables were still high at 78 days'
sales.
Revenue Covenant
3.08    Under Credit 837-YAR for the Power Distribution Project: (Power D),
YGEC was required to earn an eight percent rate of return on revalued fixed
assets, starting in fiscal year 1979/1980. In 1980, during appraisal of the
Regional Electrification Project (Power II), electricity sales were found to
be about 14/o lower than the earlier projections because of the constraints
experienced by the Corporation in connecting new consumers. In view of these
difficulties and the relatively high electricity tariffs prevalent in YAR, the
rate of return target was revised under Credit 1102-YAR for Power II approved
in January 1981 to a minimum of 3% for fiscal years 1981 through 1983, 5% for
1984, 6% for 1985, and 8% for 1986 and thereafter.
3.09    IDA has long pressed Yemen authorities to rationalize its energy
pricing policies. Under Credit 1102-YAR, the Government agreed to undertake
an energy study for formulating a strategy for phasing out subsidies for
petroleum products. However, even before conducting this study, the



- 19, -
Government decided to remove almost all fuel subsidies in one step. Thus, in
January 1981 the price of diesel oil (the only fuel used by YGEC for power
generation at the time) was increased by 72%.  Because electricity tariffs
were already very high and above YGEC's LRMC, the Government felt that an
increase in tariffs commensurate with the fuel price increase was not
politically feasible, and, therefore, electricity tariffs were raised by
Government by an average of only 7% in January 1981 along with the increase in
fuel prices. The increase in fuel prices had a devastating effect on YGEC's
financial performance and, therefore, YGEC was unable to achieve the revised
target rates of return as covenanted under Credit 1102-YAR.
3.10    Furthermore, it is estimated (Annexes 3.3 through 3.5) that YGEC would
not be able to fully cover its operating expenses earlier than 1985 because,
in addition to the increases in its operating cost caused by the diesel oil
price increase, there is and would continue to be a steady increase in labor
cost due to a greater reliance on expatriates. For example, YGEC would be
paying USS5 million to the Italian contractor, Ansaldo, to operate the new
Power plant at Ras Katenib for the first two years. Also the revenues would
increase slower than forecast during Power II appraisal in 1980 due to delays
in completing the interconnection of the isolated systems.
3.11    In view of the above, the Association has revised the revenue covenant
under Credits 837-YAR and 1102-YAR as follows: YGEC would cover at least 90%
of its operating cost in FY 1984, at least break even in FY 1985 (see para.
3.14), and achieve a return on its revalued assets of not less than 3% in FY
1986 through 1988, 5% in FY 1989, 6% in FY 1990 and 8% in FY 1991 and
thereafter. YGEC has agreed to the revised revenue covenant in the proposed
Credit.
Financial Recovery Plan
3.12    Although some of the factors influencing YGEC's present financial
position are effectively outside of the! Corporation's control (e.g. tariff,
fuel cost, etc.), it is possible for YGEC to achieve some progress towards
lowering costs and improving its earnings by identifying the causes of its
difficulties and taking appropriate corrective measures.  YGEC's critical
financial situation results as much from insufficient revenues as from high
operating costs caused by heavy reliance on expatriate staff, inadequate cost
management, high system losses and underutilization of generating capacity.
Outside consulting assistance would be necessary to analyze in detail YGEC's
organizational problems on a systematic basis, to design measures for
overcoming them and then to assist YGEC to implement these measures. The
activities which need the greatest strengthening are: (a) investment
planning; (b) management of financial and accounting matters; (c) manpower
planning, personnel policy and training; (d) project management; and (e)
management of the power generation, transmission and distribution operations.
So far as investment planning is concerned, although YGEC has numerous studies
by engineering consultants (para. 1.20), to date these have not been brought
together into a coherent and feasible investment plan. In accounting, YGEC
has a good system designed by consultants, but it is administered very poorly
because of the lack of experienced and qualified staff. This lack of
experienced and qualified staff is perhaps YGEC's most serious problem.
Manpower shortage is so acute that the Corporation has to rely on expensive



- 20, -
expatriates. Side by side with a shortage of qualified staff, there is also a
problem of overstaffing. YGEC employs a disproportionately large number of
administrative, semi-skilled and unskilled staff. Clearly, there is a need to
plan future manpower requirements, to use existing staff effectively and to
rationalize training. Cost saving procedures in maintenance and inventory
control, along with improved technical operating and safety standards will
have to be introduced.
3.13    These issues would be addressed by employing management consultants to
design and implement a "Financial Recovery Plan" in two phases, the first
phase of which would cover the period 1983-1986 and would include inter alia:
(i) provision of assistance in organization, general management, finance and
accounting; (ii) extensive study of operating costs; and (iii) preparation and
implementation of a manpower plan and adequate training prograims covering
accounting, inventory control and administrative procedures. The second phase
of the "recovery plan", which could be undertaken through IDA's next power
operation, would focus on training YGEC's staff to enable it to take over from
the presently employed expatriate staff, project management, management of
power generation, and operation of transmission and distribution systems.
The "plan" would be designed to gradually improve YGEC's financial position
through comprehensive management improvement efforts, involving not only YGEC
but also the Government as and when required (for instance concerning timely
and adequate tariff adjustments). In implementing the "plan", YGEC will have
to depend heavily on its management consultants for continuing advice,
on-the-job training and supervision. YG.C has agreed to the appointment of
consultants to assist it in formulating iand implementing the first phase of
the Financial Recovery Plan in accordances with terms of reference satisfactory
to the Association. Appointment of the consultants is a condition of Credit
effectiveness. Completion of this task would require the services of
consultants for about 90 man-months at a cost of about US$12,500 per man-month
including staff salaries, social costs, firms' overhead and fee, overseas
allowance and subsistance allowance. The total cost of this assignment is
estimated to cost US$l.l million and is expected to be completed by October
1986.
3.14    The first phase of the Financial Recovery Plan would consist of a
series of measures encompassing all managerial aspects (planning, personnel
and finance), including a comprehensive training program, and the timely
planning and implementation of adequate tariff adjustments. YGEC would take
all necessary measures to be designed by the consultants to enable YGEC by FY
1985 to fully cover from revenues its operating costs, including adequate
depreciation, and provision for bad debts, interest chargeable to operations
and taxes, if any. Furthermore, as an indication of due diligence exercised
in achieving full financial recovery, YGEC would agree to make all efforts to
achieve, as an intermediate target, 90% cost coverage by revenues by FY 1984
(para. 3.11). The proposed Terms of Reference for the management consulting
services (for both the first and second phases) and details of the measures
envisaged together with a schedule of their implementation during the first
phase are given in Annex 3.1.
3.15    YGEC has agreed to the following to ensure satisfactory progress in
implementing the Financial Recovery Plan:



- 21 -
Before March 31, 1984 in respect of FY 1984 and September 30, 1984 in
respect of FY 1985, YGEC should prepare with the assistance of its
consultants a detailed annual program of measures to be implemented by
realistic target dates in YGEC's relevant fiscal year. In
implementing the program, the Association's comments would be taken
into account. The first such program covering the period from March
1, 1984 until the end of FY 1984 will describe the measures envisaged
to achieve the first interim target of securing an operating ratio of
90% in FY 1984 and the second such program covering January-December,
1985 will describe the measures for achieving the break even target
for FY 1985.
3.16    For the years beginning with FY 1986, YGEC has agreed to review at
least three months before the end of eaLch fiscal year the adequacy of its
revenues to achieve, on the basis of a realistic forecast, the agreed return
for the following fiscal year. On the basis of this review, the Government
and YGEC would determine the measures required to achieve the agreed return,
consult with the Association on these nmeasures and on the implementation
schedule for these measures before the beginning of the following fiscal
year.
Operating Subsidy
3.17    During 1983, YGEC's revenues would not cover its cash operating costs
and interest charges and thus YGEC would be unable to meet its operating
obligations. Also in the years 1984 and 1985 if the sales were not to reach
tne projected levels (para. 4.02), YGEC would face cash deficits in covering
its cash operating costs and interest charges. The Government has agreed to
provide YGEC an operating subsidy in 1984 and 1985 so as to enable YGEC to
fully meet all its cash operating costs and interest chargeable to operations.
Relending Arrangements
3.18    During appraisal, the Government indicated to the Association that as
a matter of general policy it was considering transferring funds derived from
foreign loans and credits to YGEC as equity contributions. As long as YGEC
operates at a loss, it would be appropriate for the Government either to pass
on the Loan/Credit proceeds to YGEC as an equity contribution or to relend it
to YGEC at less than the market rates. However, the financial projections
indicate that after the implementation of the first phase of the financial
recovery plan, i.e. by 1986, YGEC would be a financially viable revenue
earning utility. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to relend the Credit
proceeds, except for US$85,000 that would finance MEW's construction standards
study, to YGEC at a rate of interest cLose to the prevailing market rate
rather tnan being passed on as equity. The Government has agreed to relend
the Credit proceeds to YGEC at an interest rate of 9% p.a. over a 20-year
repayment period inclusive of a 5-year grace period. YGEC would bear the
foreign exchange risk on the loan.
Collection of Electricity Supply Bills
3.19    Under Credits 837-YAR and 1102-YAK, YGEC is required to ensure that



- 22 -
its accounts receivable for electricity supply do not exceed 60 days'
billings. As of December 31, 1981, the latest date as of which accounts have
been prepared, YGEC was not in compliance with this covenant because its
receivables as of that date were the equivalent of 78 days' sales. Hodeidah
and Taiz, two of the three regions serving large populations, had receivables
equivalent to about two months' sales. The receivables in the Sana'a region,
which produces about 50% of YGEC's revenues, account for about 55% of YGEC's
receivables and were the equivalent of 87 days of its sales. The receivables
in each of the other regions, except Saadah, were the equivalent of about 90
days' sales and those of Saadah, the most remote region, were the equivalent
of 138 days' sales.
3.20    One of the primary reasons for large receivables is the manual
preparation of electricity bills which causes delays in collection. For this
reason, under Power II it was recommended that YGEC should computerize its
accounting and billing operations. YGEC was expecting a grant from USAID for
computerizing its accounting and billing operations; an earlier Arab Fund loan
has a provision to finance the hardware. However, funds from USAID have not
yet been made available for this task, and in view of its importance it is
proposed to provide the necessary funds under the proposed project. The work
would require 70 man-months of consultancy services, including on-the-job
training of staff, and is estimated to cost US3880,000 (US$12,500 per
man-month), of which US3650,000 would be in foreign exchange. This work is
projected to be completed by September 1985. YGEC has agreed to hire
consultants acceptable to the Association to computerize the accounting and
billing operations. Appointment of the consultants is a condition of Credit
effectiveness.
3.21    When YGEC's billing is computerized, it would considerably reduce the
billing and collection time.  Furthermore, the terms of reference for the
consultancy services proposed for implementation of a Financia'L Recovery Plan
would also include necessary provisions Ito improve YGEC's billing and
collection. However, even before computesrization or implementation of the
Financial Recovery Plan, YGEC could reduce its receivables significantly by
specially focussing on billing and collection in the Sana'a region. YGEC has
agreed to the existing covenant regarding management of receivables being
repeated under the proposed Credit, except that it would be operative after
December 31, 1984.
Revaluation of Assets
3.22    Under Credit 1102-YAR, YGEC agreesd with the Association that it would
apply the following method for revaluing its electric plant assets in
service: (a) YGEC would determine the amount of foreign costs and local costs
of electric plant assets in service as of June 30, 1980; (b) the foreign costs
of the assets in service would be revaluesd by applying the Unit: Value Index of
Manufactured Exports from Developed to Developing countries; and the local
costs would be revalued by applying the "Index of Labor Costs 'in Yemen Arab
Republic" issued by the Ministry of Economy; and (c) YGEC would review the
revaluation process each year and would revalue its assets in any year in
which either of the above two indices has increased by more than 15% since the
date of the last revaluation. In order to revalue assets, YGEC had to make an



- 23 -
inventory of assets in service, retire t:he assets which were inefficient or
obsolete, establish an engineering valuation of the assets as of an agreed
date and thereafter revalue assets in accordance with the above formula.
Since YGEC did not have the required expertise it was not able to complete the
valuation of its assets as agreed. However, with the assistance of a
commercial advisor provided by ODA, it has now completed valuation of its
assets following the procedures suggested by the Assocation. YGEC has agreed
to revalue its assets following the above-mentioned procedure.
Fuel Price Adjustment
3.23    Under Credit 1102-YAR, the Government has covenanted to introduce in
YGEC's tariffs a fuel adjustment clause which will enable YGEC to
automatically pass on to its customers all increases in its fuel costs. This
was intended to translate the gradual removal of petroleum subsidies into
higher electricity tariffs. However, the Government decided to remove all
petroleum subsidies at one stroke. If the increase in costs were to be
recovered by YGEC through tariff increases, the rise in electricity tariffs
would have been politically unacceptable and consequently IDA agreed to relax
the Covenant, in view of the importance of removing petroleum subsidies. Fuel
prices generally are not expected to increase in 1983, but might increase
faster than the rate of inflation thereafter. It is therefore unlikely that
any increase in tariffs to compensate for increases in fuel prices will be
required in 1983. From 1984 onwards, the possibility exists that increases in
fuel prices could upset any plan intended to bring the finances of YGEC to a
sound footing. Automatic fuel price adjustment of tariffs is the most simple
means of compensating quickly for fuel price changes with minimum
administrative effort.   The Government: has agreed to repeating the existing
automatic fuel adjustment provision in the proposed Credit with a proviso that
it will be operative for fuel price changes from January 1, 1985.
Financing Plan
3.24    The forecast statements of sources and applications of funds of YGEC
for the periods 1983-1988 at current costs, assuming necessary tariff
increases (15.5% in 1986, 14% in 1987 and 7% in 1988) to enable YGEC to
achieve the rates of return recommended under the proposed Credit (para. 3.11)
are given in Annex 3.3. A summarized version is given below:

3.25     YGEC's financial condition is expected to be weak through 1985.  YGEC
is not expected to generate any funds internally through 1985 for financing
expansion. However, with sales increasing at an average rate of about 20%
p.a. (para. 4.02), together with tariff increases of 15.5%, 14% and 7% assumed
for 1986, 1987 and 1988 respectively, YGEC's finances are expected to improve
significantly in 1987 and 1988 (see para. 3.27). Thus, for 1983-1988 as a
wtole, YGEC would be able to generate internally about 7% of its investment
requirements.
3.26     YGEC's investment program for 1983-88 will require about YRls 3,438
million (USd757 million) which is expected to be financed 7% from internal
sources, 1% from the operating subsidy to be provided by Government, 83% from
Government equity contributions (65% from Government's own resources and 18%
from foreign loans passed on to YGEC as equity), and 9% from borrowings. The
proposed borrowings to be relent to YGEC would consist of: (i) the loans
already committed--6%; and (ii) the proposed IDA Credit for the Project--3%.
Since financing for a substantial portion of the program has been identified
and many bilateral/international agencies including the Association have
expressed interest in participating in the future projects, the financing plan
should be considered realistic.
3.27     The forecast income statements, balance sheets, and funds statements
for the years 1983-1988 at current costs are given in Annexes 3.3 through 3.5
(assumptions relating to these are given in Annex 3.2). Assuming that the
Government would permit necessary tariff increases (i.e. 15.5% in 1986, 14% in
1987 and 7% in 1988) to partially compensate for inflation (estimated at about
46% between 1983 and 1988), YGEC would generate 11% of its construction
requirements in 1986, 52% in 1987 and 75% in 1988. The projected
self-financing level in 1987 and 1988 is high because the investments are not
evenly distributed throughout 1983-1988.  The investments are high (between
Ytls 610 and YR1s 822 million) during the period 1983 through 1986 because of
coincident peak investments in the Project, another distribution project to be
financed by the Arab Fund, and other ongoing works. During the forecast
period, YGEC's debt/equity ratio of between 50/50 to 16/84 reflects a solid
equity base. Although during the implementation period of the Financial
Recovery Plan its current ratio would be between 0.8 and 2.2, during the rest
of the projection period it would be between 5.8 in 1987 and 6.0 in 1988,
which is acceptable.
Debt Service Coverage
3.28     Under Credits 837-YAR and 1102-YAR YGEC had covenanted that it will
not incur any debt without prior approval of the Association, unless its net
revenues for the fiscal year next preceding the date of such incurrence, or
for any later twelve-month period ended prior to the date of such incurrence,
shall not be less than 1.5 times the maximum debt service requirement in any
succeeding fiscal year (including the fiscal year in which such debt is to be
incurred) on all debt including the debt to be incurred. Clearly, YGEC's debt
service coverage ratio on the above basis at least until 1986 would be below
1.5 since YGEC is a growing organization with ever-increasing debts and debt
service requirements. Under the covenant as agreed under the above Credits,
YGEC would have to seek the Association's approval constantly before resorting
to long-term borrowing. In view of the above, the Association has revised the



- 26 -
debt-service covenant under Credits 837-YAR and 1102-YAR as follows: YGEC
shall obtain the Association's prior approval for any new long-term borrowing
unless the net revenue for each year during the term of the debt (before
depreciation and interest) is at least equal to 1.5 times the projected debt
service requirement for such year, on all its debt, including the debt to be
incurred. On such a basis, YGEC's debt service coverage ratio during
1987-1988 (i.e. after the implementation of the Financial Recovery Plan) is
projected to be 2.6 in 1987 and 3.3 in 1988, which is satisfactory. YGEC has
agreed to repeating the revised debt-service covenant in the proposed credit.
Auditing
3.29      Under the existing Credit, YGEC is required to submit to the
Association its annual financial statements, audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Association, and the audit report within 6 months after the
end of each fiscal year. The present audit arrangements, under which a
Cairo-based firm of auditors, Dr. Hegazy & Co., audits its accounts, are
satisfactory. Although there have been delays in audit in the past, it is
expected that with the implementation of the Financial Recovery Plan and
beginning with the accounts for 1985, YGEC would be able to submit its audited
accounts to the Association within the prescribed period of 6 months after the
end of the fiscal year. YGEC has agreed to the existing audit covenant being
repeated in the proposed Credit so far as the accounts for 1985 and onwards
are concerned. Extended periods, as appropriate ranging up to one year, for
the submission of the accounts through 1984 would be discussed and agreed with
YGEC during the next supervision mission of the ongoing projects.
Insurance
3.30      YGEC insures its assets against the usual hazards of fire, explosion,
etc., through the Marib Insurance Company, which reinsures with Lloyds of
London. Under Credit 1102-YAR, the insurance coverage requires annual
inspection of plant and equipment by qualified inspectors to ensure that YGEC
complies with sound public utility practices. YGEC has agreed to extend such
insurance coverage to the facilities constructed under the Project.

IV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Load Forecast
4.01      YGEC prepares its load forecast assisted by K&D.  In March 1982 a
load forecast was prepared on the basis of earlier projections prepared by
NRECA during preparation of the NEP, and K&D projections prepared in late
1981. However, in light of the considerable deviations that were experienced
in the past between the forecast and actual outcomes, this forecast was
revised in October 1982 to take account of more recent information concerning
progress of projects under construction. YGEC's last forecast (Annexes 4.1)
was derived on the basis of parameters calculated from the last population
census, YGEC's historic rates of growth observed between 1975 and 1981, YGEC's
expansion program, and projected industrial development. The assumptions used
in deriving the demand forecast are given in Annex 4.2. YGEC's forecast was
reviewed by IDA and found reasonable.
4.02     Between the period 1982 and 1992, YGEC's sales are forecast to grow
at an average rate of about 20% p.a., compared to the historic growth of 29%
(1975-1982). The high rate of growth is projected to be sustained mainly due
to the growth of sales to bulk consumers which is forecast to increase from
16 GWh in 1982 to 523 GWh in 1992, accounting for about 43% of YGEC's total
sales in 1992. If, however, the forecast sales to bulk consumers, especially
cement plants, do not materialize, YGEC's actual sales in the future would
fall short of the forecast sales.
4.03     YGEC's peak demand is forecast to grow at 16% p.a. (from 67 MW in
1982 to 290 KW in 1992). However, YGEC's existing and committed generating
capacity would be adequate to meet the peak demand, with adequate reserve
margin (18%), through 1990.
Least Cost Alternative
4.04      The proposed Project represents the second phase (1983-1986) of the
18-year National Electrification Program (NEP), and the third phase of the
urban rehabilitation program for extending public supply of electricity
throughout YAR (para. 1.05). The NEP was formulated by NRECA, and the urban
distribution program by K&D, and the consultants demonstrated that these
programs constitute the least cost solution for meeting demand. The proposed
Project was derived from these two programs which cover the period through
1990 and have been designed to be implemented over successive phases, where
each phase considered on its own merit, would represent the least-cost
alternative for extending electricity service to the beneficiaries. The
proposed Project evolved as a result of detailed engineering and economic
studies entailing the evaluation of all feasible alternatives.
Return on Investment
4.05      The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) on the investment is 18% which
compares favorably with an opportunity cost for capital of about 10%. It is
based on the measurable benefits and costs associated with the Project. The
costs include the project's capital expenditures, the LRMC cost of generation



- 28 -
and transmission adjusted for distribution losses (YRls 0.40/kWh for MV
consumers, YRls 0.61/kWh for LV urban, and YRls 0.71/kWh for LV rural
consumers), 1/ and operation and maintenance of the distribution system
assumed to be 2% of capital expenditure.  In estimating the benefits, the
revenue from the sales of electricity has been calculated by taking as a proxy
for the customer's willingness to pay the current and projected tariffs
(expressed in real terms) applicable to each customer class (urban, rural and
industrial), and the customers' contributions, by assuming connection charges
of YRls 830 per domestic and YRIs 2,000 per small industrial and commercial
customer.
4.06     Sensitivity analysis was made by:  (i) considering the power plant at
Al Mukha as sunk cost; (ii) increasing thae capital cost of the Project by 20%;
and (iii) reducing the incremental sales by 10%. Under these assumptions the
ERR on the investment would be as follows:
(i)  Generating plant at Al Mukha assumed as sunk cost:            24%
(ii)  Project capital cost increased by 20%                :        15%
(iii)  Incremental electricity sales decreased by 10%   :            14%
4.07     The current trend of declining oil prices would not affect the ERR on
the inv7estment of the proposed Project because the anticipated benefits would
start to accrue in late 1985, after the Government has introduced (January 1,
1985) the agreed fuel adjustment clause (para. 3.23).
1/ Plant at Al Mukha was taken to represent the incremental plant.

/4  Available capacity of interconnected system is assumed to be:  (i) diesel units 75% after largest unit has been removed; and (ii) thermal
units 601. during first year of commercial operation, 75% during second year, 85% during third year and thereafter, after largest unit has
been removed.

/6  Specific consumption R.K for 1983 and 1984 estimated at 310 gr/kWh generated (assuming 10 hrs. at 75% load and 14 hrs. at 29% load).  From
1985 onwards consumption of RK is estimated at 280 gr/kWh generated (assuming 10 hrs. at 75% load and 14 hbr. at 50% load).  Generation mix
is assumed 15% from diesel units and 85% from steam units up to 1985, and 10% from diesel units and 90% from steam units from 1986 and
thereafter.  For start-np and tests of RK units it was assumed that 3,C00 tons of diesel and 5,000 tons of fuel oil would be used in 1983,
and 4,000 tons of diesel and 5,000 tons of fuel oil in 1984.  Starting in 1984 the 5 MW diesel units would be converted to operate on fuel
oil.

YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC PROJECT
THIRD POWER PROJECT
MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR "FINANCIAL RECOVERY PLAN"
YEMEN GENERAL ELECTRICITY CORPORATION
Terms of Reference
Background and Description of Services
Yemen General Electricity Corporation (YGEC) is presently engaging a
British consulting firm, Kennedy & Donkin (K&D), and an American consulting
firm, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA), to assist it in
providing extensive engineering services for a number of generation,
transmission, distribution and rural electrification projects being
implemented with the assistance of International and Bilateral Development
Institutions including the International Development Association (IDA). IDA
financed through Credit No. 837-YAR, the First Power Project (Distribution).
IDA has extended a second credit in 1981, Credit 1102-YAR, for the Second
Power Project (Distribution and Rural Electrification), which, inter alia will
be used to finance part of the foreign exchange cost of the continuing
distribution and rural electrification programs. In 1982, IDA has appraised a
Third Power Project to meet the additional distribution requirements of YAR.
The proposed IDA Credit would, inter alia, be used to finance a part of the
foreign exchange cost of the proposed Management Services.
The Services would assist YGEC to implement a comprehensive
financial recovery plan, which would take into account all aspects of YGEC's
administration and operations and is designed to allow YGEC not later than
during its fiscal year 1985 to cover out of the revenues from its sales of
electricity all its administrative and operating expenses (including
maintenance, adequate provision for depreciation and bad debt, and taxes, if
any) and interest chargeable to operations and other charges on debt.
Furthermore, the Services, to be performed in two phases, are
designed to enable YGEC to plan annually the measures required to make
adequate progress towards financial recovery during each of its annual
financial recovery programs and to review and assess in semi-annuial intervals
the actual progress made.
The first phase of the Services :is expected to be completed by June
30, 1986.

Page 2 of 7
Scope of Services
The management consultant will make recommendations to YGEC and
assist it in improving its entire management including the accomplishment of
training. The improvement of management covering activities relating to
planning, personnel and finance is expected to be accomplished in about three
years, 1983-1986, during the first phase of the proposed services. The
services for the second phase to be separately contracted for would cover
improvement of management in the areas of construction, operation and
maintenance of the generating plants, and transmission and distribution
systems. The first phase would be designed to assist YGEC to achieve financial
recovery and attain the following operating ratios not later than over the
following fiscal years- FY1984 - 90 percent, and FY1985 - 100 percent.
In performing the Services, the Consultant should review the earlier
reports of YGEC's Management Consultants, Peat, Marwick and Mitchell (PMM) and
British Electricity International (BEI) and prepare an implementation schedule
of their appropriate recommendations. Furthermore, it should identify and
systematically analyze, in consultation with the YGEC, the problems
confronting it and submit in due time program proposals, stipulating clearly
the activities, the flow of activities, detailed time schedules, and provide
day-to-day assistance and advice to YGEC's management on all aspects of their
Corporation's operations. The proposed contract would be limited to the items
listed in the "First Phase of the Plan, 1983-1986". The items listed under
the "Second Phase" would be covered under a separate contract that would be
finalized after reviewing the progress achieved during the first phase. The

YEMEN GENERAL ELECTRICITY CORPORATION
Notes and Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
I. General
1.        All financial forecasts are given for the fiscal years of YGEC
beginning January 1 and ending December 31.  In addition to its power utility
operations, YGEC is engaged in water utility operations in Al Baydah and
Hajjah.
II. Income Statement
2.         Sales of Electricity are based on information furnished by YGEC and
its two consultants, K&D and NRECA, as modified in the Association.  The
forecasts assume annual kWh sales growth of 24.0% in 1983, 63.8% in 1984,
36.5% in 1985, 11.0X in 1986, 16.5% in 1987, and 17.6% in 1988.
3.        Average Revenue per kWh for 1983 is based on the existing rates,
i.e., YRL 1.1/kWh for urban and YRL 1.5lkWh for rual consumers, and the
proposed tariff of 0.75/kWh for the industrial and bulk supply consumers.  The
forecast assumes that average tariff in,^reases of 15.5% in 1986, 14% in 1987
and 7% in 1988 would be permitted to partially compensate for inflation
(estimated at 46% between 1983 and 1986) and to comply with the revised target
rates of return under the proposed Credit.
4.         Other Operating Revenues are assumed to increase 10 % per annum.
5.         Salaries and Wages are based on YGEC's forecasts.
6.         Fuel and Lubricants are based on estimates of fuel consumptions for
steam and diesel generating units, and fuel prices as follows:
(a) Fuel Consumptions:
Fuel Consumptions                               Heavy Fuel Oil         Diesel Oil
Tonne               Tonne
1983                                          51,300              48,700
1984                                         119,800              43,500
1985                                         166,300              30,000
1986                                         194,600              21,300
1987                                         226,800              26,500
1988                                         263,000              31,000

(b)  Fuel Prices.  The prices agreed with YOMINCO for 1983 are (i) Heavy
Fuel Oil YRL/908/t and (ii) Diesel Oil YRL/1572/t.  The projections
assume fuel price changes in real terms at -6.9% p.a. in 1983,
1.9% p.a. during 1984 and 1985, and 2.9% p.a. during the years 1985
through 1988.
Lube Oil Consumption is assumed at 3 grams/kWh generated by diesel
units.
Lube Oil Price, YRL 720/bbl (1982), is assumed to increase at the
same rate at which fuel price cnanges are assumed.
7.        Maintenance Charges are assumed to increase proportional to the
increases in fixed assets in service.
8.        Staff Retirement is assumed at 15% of salaries and wages.

YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
THIRD POWER PROJECT
Assumptions for Rate of Return
General
All costs are expressed in terms of domestic prices with the
exception of fuel cost for which a border value was readily available.
Costs
(i)  Fuel cost:  The border price for fuel oil is US3200/ton, and for
diesel oil US$380/ton;
(ii)  LRM1C:  In the Base Case, the costs associated with the power plant
at Ras Katenib and the transmission system are considered sunk cost,
while the plant at Al Mukha is taken to represent the incremental
plant;
(iii)  In Case II, the power plants at Ras Katenib and Al Mukha, and tne
transmission system are considered sunk costs; and
(iv) The LRMIC under the above two assumptions, adjusted for losses, is
given below:
LRMIC (YRls/kWh)
Low Voltage      Low Voltage
Medium Voltage       Urban              Rural
Case II                      0.333            0.434            0.488
Base Case                    0.404            0.614             0.707
(v)  0 & M:  Operation and Maintenance of the distribution system has been
assumed equal to 2/. p.a. of the capital cost.
Incremental Sales
Incremental sales attributable to the Project have been calculated on
the following assumptions:
(i)  the industrial load to be connected to the grid was taken to be 20 tMW
operating at a load factor of 0.70 for 3,000 hours a year;
(ii)  the rate of connection of industrial load was taken to be 24% by
1985, 60% by 1986, 67% by 1987 and 100% by 1988;



- 66 -                          ANNEX 4.4
Page 2 of 3
(iii)  of the 15,500 low voltage consumers (13,700 domestic, and 1,800 small
commercial and industrial), 50% would be connected in 1985 and 50%
would be connected in 1986;
(iv)  for the domestic urban consumers (totaling 8,100), a specific
consumption of 1,383 kWh/year--customer was taken, while for the same
class of rural consumers (totaling 5,600), a specific consumption of
785 kWh/year-customer was assumed;
(v)  for small commercial and industrial urban consumers (totaling 500) a
specific consumption of 1,693 kWh/year-customer was taken, while for
the same class of rural consumers (totaling 1,300) a specific
consumption of 850 kWh/year-customer was assumed;
(vi)  the number of urban consumers has been assumed to increase at a rate
of 2% p.a. to year 2007, while for rural consumers the same rate 2%
p.a. was assumed to continue for only 5 years (up to 1991); and
(vii)  specific consumption was assumed to increase at the rate of 4% p.a.
to year 2007 for urban consumers, and to year 1996 for rural
consumers;
Benefits
The benefits attributrable to the project consist of:
(i)  Revenue from sales of electricLty:  In computing revenues, the
following tariffs (in real terms) have been assumed:
URBAN             RURAL           INDUSTRIAL         Local
Year       Nominal  Real   Nominal  Real   Nominal  Real   Inflation %
1983         1.10   1.06       1.50   1.44      0.75   0.72         8
1984         1.10   1.02       1.50   1.40      0.75   0.70         7
1985         1.10   0.96       1.50   1.31      0.75   0.65         6
1986         1.25   1.03       1.70   1.40      0.85   0.70         6
1987         1.40   1.09       1.90   1.48      0.97   0.75         6
1988 and    1.50   1.10        2.00   1.46      1.04   0.76         6
thereafter
(ii) Connection charges: Calculted by taking YRls 830 per connection of
domestic consumers and YRls 2,000 per connection of small industrial
and commercial consumers.

Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis was conducted with costs expressed under three
different scenarios, and benefits under two scenarios.
A. Costst
(i)  The first scenario (Base Case) considers the cost of the plant at
Ras Katenib, as well as the transmission system, sunk costs;
(ii)  the second scenario (Case I) assumes that Project costs are higher
by 20% than those estimated for the Base Case, which are the
project cost estimates used in the SAR; and
(iii)  the third scenario (Case II) assumes that costs associated with
existing, under construction and committed generating capacity, as
well as the transmission system, are sunk cost;
B. Benefits.
(i)  In the first scenario (Base Case) revenues are derived on the basis
of the forecast sales valued at the current and projected tariffs
expressed in real terms; and
(ii)  in the second scenario (Case B) revenues are derived on the basis
of 10% lower forecast sales valued at the current and projected
tariffs expressed in real terms.
