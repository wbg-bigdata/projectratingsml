MUNICIPAL AND HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Credit 1884-SE
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
1.    This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) of the Municipal and Housing
Development Project (PGDU) of Senegal, for which Credit 1884-SE in the amount of SDR 32.5
million (US$46.0 million equivalent) was approved on March 15, 1988, signed on May 27,
1988, and declared effective on November 3, 1988.
2.    Credit 1884-SE was closed on January 31, 1997, twenty-two months after the original
closing date of March 31, 1995. There were three extensions of 12 months, 6 months and
finally 4 months. The total disbursement for the project was SDR 30.5 million.
3.    The ICR was prepared by Mr. Gerard Tenaille, Consultant, and Ms. Catherine
Farvacque-Vitkovic, Senior Urban Planner, AFTU2, task manager for the project. Preparation
of the report was begun during a final supervision/completion mission to Senegal in November
1996. The ICR is based on project files, correspondence, the Staff Appraisal Report, the Credit
Agreement and the Project Agreement and discussions with individuals involved at various stages
of the project cycle. The Borrower contributed to the preparation of the ICR by preparing its
own evaluation of the project's execution, in May 1997. The complete text of the Borrowers
report is available in French.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
SENEGAL
MUNICIPAL AND HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
CREDIT 1884-SE
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    This Implementation Completion Report evaluates the Municipal and Housing
Development Project of Senegal, implemented by the Urban Project Unit, created within
the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Planning.
Project Objectives
2.    The major objectives of the project were to: (i) develop the organizational,
technical and financial capacities of the local governments of the Greater Dakar area; and
(ii) expand the efficiency of the housing sector by removing financial and institutional
constraints to the Housing Bank of Senegal (BHS), and improving the operation of the
urban land market through annual supply of a significant number of serviced and titled
plots (page 2, para. 4). These objectives were clear and realistic.
Experience and Results
3.    The project achieved most of its objectives, in terms of financial and
institutional progress, as well as physical realizations (page 6, para. 18).
(a) Municipal Credit Fund (MCE). The MCF was created to allow local
governments to borrow for income generating investments, at an interest rate
of about 6 per cent per year, with a repayment period of seven years. This
component started very slowly because, in the past, the municipalities had
always used grants from the "Fonds d'Equipement des Collectivites Locales"
(FECL). In addition, the AGETIP project, which provided municipalities
with grants, made MCF not competitive. It did not achieve its objectives, and
will not continue to operate according to the present arrangements (page 7,
para. 23).
(b) Strengthening of CUD's Technical Department. The project financed
technical assistance, public works equipment and the rehabilitation of a
number of public facilities (schools, latrines, administrative centers, etc.). In
spite of considerable delays, due to cumbersome procurement procedures, this
component achieved its objectives very satisfactorily (page 8, para. 28).



ii
(c) Traffic and Public Transport Improvement. The project provided the
Traffic Bureau with long-term technical assistance and financed the
rehabilitation or widening of numerous avenues and streets of Dakar, which
improved traffic and the road system. This component was delayed by the
Government's incapacity to regularly supply counterpart funds to the project.
Nonetheless, this component achieved its objectives (page 8, para. 30).
(d) Municipal Resource Mobilization. The project financed technical assistance,
training and equipment for the implementation of a fiscal cadastre, in order to
increase the municipal fiscal revenues. Results are satisfactory with regard to
the increase of the identified tax base, but unsatisfactory because tax collection
did not improve. The objectives were therefore partially achieved (page 9,
para. 35).
(e) Land Development Program. A Land Development Corporation, SCAT-
URBAM, was established to supply an annual average of 1,800 serviced plots.
It played a financial role by receiving down payments and savings from
applicants for the acquisition of plots. SCAT-URBAM's financial position
forced the BHS, which was supposed to provide the financing of SCAT-
URBAM's projects, to refuse to finance the Grand Yoff operation (page 10,
para. 37).  Using only the savings of its customers, SCAT-URBAM
completed 350 plots per year from 1990 to 1996, and therefore did not
achieve its objective of 1,800 per year.
(f) Housing Loans. The project financed housing sub-loans, with a repayment
period of 15 years, through a CFAF 4 billion loan from the Government to
BHS, at the interest rate of 6 per cent per year, with a repayment period of 25
years. BHS granted up to 1,402 loans per year, less than the objective of
1,500 per year, but the majority of loans financed very low cost housing. In
particular, 23.5% of the loans were awarded to self-help builders. This
component achieved its objectives (page 11, para. 41).
4.    The implementation schedule was over run by 22 months. This delay is mainly
due to the project preparation which had been too short to complete the final design
studies for all the components. This was done after Credit effectiveness. In addition, the
availability and timeliness of counterpart funds was a cause of delay (page 7, para. 30);
the Bank having decided to not give non-objections as long as counterpart funds had not
been mobilized.  Finally, except for AGETIP, the procurement procedures are so
cumbersome in Senegal that they caused important delays, some contracts having been
signed two years after the invitation to bid (page 5, para. 13).
5.    Major Factors affecting the Project.  The only important external factor
affecting the project was the devaluation of the CFA franc by 50%, in January 1994.
The project unit had to recalculate the costs of all the current contracts to compensate the



iii
contractors which delayed some contracts by six months. On the other hand, the
devaluation led to a work volume increase (page 6, para. 17).
Project Sustainability
6.    The project had a partial impact on municipal institutions and especially on
municipal finance, key to project's sustainability. The CUD's Technical Department has
been strengthened, in capacity and equipment, which should enable them to efficiently
manage the CUD's infrastructure. The fiscal cadastre provided the CUD and the
Treasury with an efficient tool which, if these institutions make an effort to improve the
tax collection, should considerably increase the tax revenues. Since this is the condition
of sustainability for the works financed by the project, one can conclude that the project's
sustainability is likely (page 11, para. 42).
Bank Performance
7.    Staff time for the project preparation was too short, which delayed the start-up of
the project, because the final design studies were not ready at Credit effectiveness. The
supervision of the project by the Bank was satisfactory, with a good staff continuity. In
particular, the Bank was able to restructure the project at the approach of the initial
Credit closing date. On the whole, the Bank's performance is satisfactory (page 11, para.
43-44).
Borrower Performance
8.    The Borrower's performance was mnixed. The Government was responsible for
delays in implementation, because necessary counterpart funds were not made available
on time. On the other hand, the project unit performed very satisfactorily. This is partly
partially due to the fact that the project's director stayed in office from 1990 to 1997
(page 12, para. 46).
Conclusions, Future Operations and Major Lessons
9.    The project can be deemed satisfactory (page 12, para. 48).
10.   The project's good results justified pursuing the experience with a fourth urban
project, the Urban Development and Decentralization Program (UDDP) (page 12, para.
49).
11.   This project was too complicated and therefore difficult to implement and
supervise. Components such as the fiscal cadastre were too complex and costly. Both
costs and complexities are often driven by suppliers eager to sell their high tech products.
For a project to be manageable, it is crucial to keep it as simple as possible.



iv
12.   The Bank has a strong responsibility in enhancing coherence of approaches in the
same country. The initial failure of the MCF is partially due to the competition with
AGETIP which was not foreseen when the Agetip operation began. (page 13, para. 50)

CREDIT 1884-SE
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
Name of the Project: Municipal and Housing Development Project
Credit Number:    1884-SE
Credit Amount:    SDR 32.5 million (US$46.0 million equivalent)
Vice-Presidency:    Africa Region
Country:          Senegal
Sector:           Urban
Sub-Sector:       Urban Development
A. INTRODUCTION
1.    Between 1960, date of its independence, and 1994, Senegal faced a high
population growth rate of 2.7 per cent annually, the population increasing from 3.5 to
8.7 million. A strong migration from the rural areas towards the cities brought an
urban growth rate of about 5 per cent per year in Dakar from 1970 to 1980 and 4.2
per cent since 1990. The urban population already represents 42 per cent of the total
population of Senegal and should represent, at the end of the century, 50 per cent of a
global population of about 9 million inhabitants.
2.    By 1988, 70 per cent of modern employment and 90 per cent of industrial
firms of the country were located in metropolitan Dakar, which represented 58 per
cent of the GNP. Based on population estimates, Senegal's GNP per capita was
estimated at US$600 in 1995. Population over concentration in Greater Dakar would
be counterproductive in the long term and measures need to be taken to foster a more
balanced distribution of urban population throughout the country.
3.    The first urban project financed by the Bank was the Sites and Services Project
of Senegal (Credit 336-SE, US$8 million), approved in 1972 and closed on December
31, 1981. This project focused on housing and delivered 15,200 serviced plots in
Dakar and Thies. In 1980, the Government requested Bank participation in a sector
review, which led to a second project, the Technical Assistance Project for Urban
Management and Rehabilitation (Credit 1458-SE/SF13-SE, US$6 million). This
Credit was approved on April 17, 1984 and closed on December 31, 1989. The



-2 -
objective of the project was to reinforce Dakar's urban institutions. Through studies,
technical assistance and selective investments, the project aimed at improving planning
and programming capacities, rationalizing the housing policy and maintaining the level
of urban services. In September 1985, the Government and the Bank concluded that
the recommendations of these studies could be the basis of a third urban project. In
December 1985, the Government requested an identification mission, which took place
in January 1986.
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
4.    The project had two major objectives: (a) strengthening local governments,
particularly in metropolitan Dakar, to improve policy making, service delivery, urban
investment and resource mobilization; and (b) expanding the economic impact and
efficiency of the housing sector by: (i) removing financial and institutional constraints to
the Housing Bank of Senegal (BHS); and (ii) improving the operation of the urban land
market through annual supply of a significant number of serviced and titled plots while
promoting progressive privatization of the delivery of housing.
Project Description
5.    To achieve these objectives, the project included six components, four related to
municipal management and two related to housing. These six components were:
(a) Municipal Management
(i) A Municipal Credit Fund (MCF), administered by the Housing Bank of
Senegal (BHS), would be created for lending to local governments, at
BCEAO's discount rate plus two points, for municipal income generating
projects, such as market rehabilitation and construction. Initial financing of
this fund would be provided by IDA for US$3.3 million and by the
Government through a share of the Grant Fund for Local Governments
(FECL) which was to reach US$11.3 million over the period of the project
execution.
(ii) The Technical Department of the Urban Community of Dakar (CUD) would
be strengthened through the financing of: (a) civil works equipment; (b)
extension of technical facilities; (c) 72 man/months of technical assistance; (d)
a training program; and (e) the remodeling and equipment of selected
community facilities.
(iii)The Traffic and Transport component would improve public transport
operation through: (a) financing of 96 man/months of technical assistance to
the Traffic Bureau; (b) rehabilitation of CUD's main collector roads (68 krm);
(c) implementation of a traffic management plan in the central Dakar area



-3 -
(plateau); and (d) improvement of key junctions and selected sections of the
road network in Dakar.
(iv)The Municipal Resource Mobilization component would provide the basis for
improved collection of municipal taxes through the implementation of a fiscal
cadastre in the Dakar metropolitan area, aimed at improving tax billing and
collection by: (a) organizing and unifying property and business registry and
valuation; and (b) modernizing computerized processing of tax bills.
(b) Housing
(v) Establishment of a Land Development Corporation (SCAT-URBAM), and
financing the starting period of a program of land development, of about
1,800 serviced plots per year.
(vi)Financing of a loan of CFAF 4 billion from the Government to BHS, to help
remove bottlenecks preventing BHS from increasing its share of housing
financing, and increase its annual lending from 1,000 to 1,500 fifteen year
loans per year.
C. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MAJOR FACTORS
AFFECTING THE PROJECT
Project Preparation
6.    The preparation of the project was based on the studies carried out under the
Technical Assistance Project for Urban Management and Rehabilitation, particularly: (a)
the investment program; (b) the urban policy; (c) the transport policy; and (d) the
municipal policy.
7.    After the identification mission of January 1986, the preparation of the project
focused on the finalization of the above studies, which recommended the creation of two
new institutions:
(i) a Municipal Credit Fund (MCF) allowing local governments to borrow for
income generating investments, in addition to the grants of FECL. The
management of MCF would be entrusted to an existing financial institution,
the BHS, which performed relatively well.
(ii) a land Development Corporation (SCAT-URBAM), answering a need
identified since 1983, for which the financial study was not finalized.
8.    A solid waste management component was included at the beginning, but was
later canceled. The program of physical realizations was well defined, but because of the



-4 -
short period of preparation, from January 1986 to April 1987, the final design had not
been prepared for any of the components before Credit effectiveness: rehabilitation of the
CUD's public facilities, rehabilitation of the CUD's main collector roads, traffic
management plan and design of the fiscal cadastre. This resulted in a two year delay in
the project's implementation, with the first significant disbursements in the fall of 1990.
9.    The pre-appraisal mission took place in April 1987. Since the funds of Credit
1458-SE were exhausted, a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) to finance the preparation
studies was requested on May 8, 1987, in the amount of US$750,000, and awarded on
June 18, 1987, under the number P.434-SE. The appraisal mission took place from June
19 to July 7, 1987. The negotiations were held in Washington from January 25 to 28,
1988. Approved on March 15, 1988 by the IDA Board, the Credit was signed on May
27, 1988.
10.   The conditions of effectiveness were: (a) establishment of MCF, through a
decree; (b) creation of the land development corporation (SCAT-URBAM); (c)
amendment of BHS statutes in order to authorize BHS to manage MCF; (d) modification
of the 25/1/78 decree establishing FECL; and (e) execution of the Tripartite Agreement
on behalf of the Borrower, BHS and SCAT-URBAM. These complex conditions delayed
the Credit effectiveness: forecast for August 27, 1988, the effectiveness was extended
twice, to October 15, 1988, then to December 15, 1988, and was finally declared on
November 3, 1988.
Project Management
11.   The Technical Assistance Project for Urban Management and Rehabilitation
(Credit 1458-SE) had been managed by a Project Unit established within the Ministry of
Economy, Finance and Planning. Since the project implementation had been satisfactory,
the same organization was kept for the present project. There were two project directors
between 1987 and 1990, but the third one, appointed in August 1990, stayed in the same
position until the Credit closed, on January 31, 1997. This continuity was one of the
causes of the project's success.
Project Implementation
12.  Implementation of the project started very slowly because, as mentioned in para.
8 above, the final design studies were to be carried out, as well as the bidding documents.
The bidding process used the normal procurement procedures of the Government and was
therefore very long, both for studies and works procurement. It is worth noting that until
1992 there was no high level engineer involved in the project, neither in the project unit
nor on the Bank's side, where the task manager was a financial analyst.  The
disbursements jumped when an engineer was associated to the project in 1992. The
absence of Bank standard bidding documents, in French, brought about additional work
for the task managers and considerable delays. Each bidding process gave rise to the
same reminders and discussions, several correspondences were needed, until the end of



-5 -
the project, before a non-objection was granted. It was the same thing for procurement
of studies or technical assistance.
13.   The cumbersome national procurement procedures and the slowness of
administrative approvals prevented the project unit from making up for the initial delay.
The most significant delays were the following: (a) rehabilitation of CUD's public
facilities - bid opening: January 1991 and - contract award: March 1992 and (b) road of
Niayes - invitation to bid: June 1991 and - contract approval: June 1993.
14. In April 1994, one year before the initial Credit closing date, less than 50 per cent
of the credit was disbursed and only 62 per cent at the closing date, on March 31, 1995.
For two important components, the works were started after the initial closing date:
construction of the CUD's technical facilities and the traffic management plan in the
central Dakar area. The Bank envisaged, at the end of 1994, cancelling the remaining
funds of the project and closing the Credit unless a solution was found to speed up
procurement. Finally, during a mission to Senegal in November 1994, a strict action
plan was negotiated. This plan has been respected and activities and disbursements
started again on a large scale after the extension of the closing date. It was then possible
to implement the whole project, with three extensions of 12, 6 and 4 months, i.e. a total
of 22 months. It would have been easier to grant two one year extensions.
Cofmancing
15.   From the beginning of the project preparation, the Bank and the Government
searched for cofmancing. The Canadian Government manifested its interest and awarded
a grant of US$2,732,340 to the project, through the Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA), and asked the Bank to administer this grant. Two agreements were
signed on September 14, 1988, one between the Government of Canada and IDA and the
other one between the Government of Senegal and IDA. This Canadian contribution was
to finance the technical assistance to the CUD's Technical Services, to the Traffic Bureau
and to the "Direction du Cadastre".
16.   The Canadian contribution had a considerable impact on the fiscal cadastre
component, which was designed by the engineering firm financed by this grant. This
component, was called at the beginning a simplified fiscal cadastre, but became more and
more sophisticated, and the cost of the studies increased extensively. In March 1991, the
amount of the grant was extended to US$3,828,000. Its closing date also was extended
from March 31, 1995 to March 31, 1996, then to September 30, 1996, and the
disbursements continued until January 31, 1997.
Major Factors affecting the Project
17.   Other than project readiness, cumbersome public procurement and availability of
free funds from AGETIP, the only other major factor affecting the project was the
devaluation of the CFA franc, in January 1994. After this devaluation, a Bank mission



-6-
went to Senegal. All the ongoing contracts were renegotiated with the contractors to
compensate for the loss of profit due to the devaluation. These discussions were carried
out without major problems but brought about a supplemental delay of about six months.
On the other hand, the devaluation led to an increase in the volume of work because the
IDA Credit expressed in SDR provided more CFA francs.
D. PROJECT RESULTS AND ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
18.    The project results were satisfactory, in terms of institutional improvement as
well as physical realizations. We will examine the results of each component, following
the project's description (para. 5).
(a) Municipal Management
(I) Municipal Credit Fund (MCF)
19.   The Govermnent had established a grant system to help finance the local
governments' capital investments, called "Fonds d'Equipement des Collectivites Locales"
(FECL), created on July 4, 1977. Since its creation, FECL had only distributed grants.
It was forecast that the funds allocated to FECL would reach CFAF 4 billion per year,
but the average has been 2.5 billion. To alleviate the Government's financial burden, the
project proposed the creation of a Municipal Credit Fund, which would be financed
partly by FECL and partly by the IDA Credit 1884-SE. These funds would be on-lent to
municipalities for income generating projects, such as public markets.
20.   The nominal interest rate charged to the local governments would be calculated as
the BCEAO's discount rate plus two points, i.e. 10.5 per cent at that time, with a
repayment period of seven years including a grace period of one year (Article Il.b.ii of
the Project Agreement IDA-BHS). However, FECL would also finance, on a temporary
basis, a share of interest owed by borrowers in order to alleviate their debt service. In
October 1989, following an increase of the prime rate, the beneficiary local governments
requested a revision of the interest rates, and the following conditions were retained:
Interest rate: 11 %
Part borne by the local government: 6%
"Bonification" provided by the State: 5%
Exemption of TPS on interests.
21.   To confirm this change, the Credit Agreement and the Project Agreement IDA-
BHS were amended in November 1991. Nevertheless, as expected, there was no demand
for this kind of financing. The FECL and the two Public Works and Employment
Projects (Credits IDA 2075 and 2369-SE) managed by AGETIP financed all sub-projects
on a non-refundable basis. Although MCF was supposed to only finance economically
profitable local projects, the borderline with the AGETIP projects was not clear, the
second AGETIP project also financed income generating projects. It should be noted that



-7 -
when AGETIP funding expired, a greater demand from local governments to MCF
funding resulted in a large number of sub-projects at the end of the credit.
22.   The third difficulty faced by MCF was the complexity of procedures: the National
Loan Committee seldom and irregularly met, and BHS also had its own appraisal
commission. But as soon as AGETIP's non-reimbursable project funds had been
exhausted, the mayors again turned to MCF: the first disbursement from the IDA Credit
for MCF only took place in June 1996, during the second extension of the Credit closing.
In the last months of the project, 14 loans were processed for a global amount of CFAF
2.9 billion.
23.   In conclusion, MCF had the great merit to initiate municipalities into credit
procedures and program evaluations, and to make local authorities aware of the need to
borrow for municipal income generating projects. Unfortunately, its impact in terms of
loans volume was limited, mainly because of the difficulties mentioned above. The
lessons learned from the MCF experience will be taken into account in the Urban
Development and Decentralization Program (UDDP), presented to the Board on
November 20, 1997, which aims to simplify and rationalize the financing mechanisms of
municipal investments, through the harmonization of the different credit lines. The
CFAF 2.5 billion allocated by FECL to MCF, which has not been disbursed, will be
transferred to the UDDP as a contribution to the municipal investment program. In
conclusion, the Municipal Credit Fund did not achieve its objectives, and it will not
continue to operate according to the present arrangements.
(ii) Strengthening of CUD's Technical Department
24.   This component included technical assistance, provision of civil works equipment,
rehabilitation of selected community facilities and remodeling of technical facilities. The
objectives of this component were achieved.
25.   A contract for technical assistance was signed on November 13, 1991 (three years
after Credit effectiveness), financed by the Canadian grant. It comprised three experts,
advisers to the technical director, the works division chief and the equipment division
chief. These experts had a very positive impact on the technical department's operations,
but their intervention was too short (18 months for the two first ones and 2 years for the
third one) to give enough training to their local counterpart.
26.   The project provided to CUD an important quantity of public works equipment
and vehicles which allowed CUD's technical department to maintain roads.
Nevertheless, the question remains regarding whether it was reasonable to provide heavy
equipment to CUD, which now has the capacity to carry out civil works on force
account, instead of contracting them to private contractors, which would be better for
everybody. CUD made a useful decision by leasing these materials to small private
enterprises.



-8 -
27.   The project financed rehabilitation and equipment of a number of public facilities:
schools, dispensaries, pit-latrines, administrative centers, technical and training centers.
Most of these works have been realized, with some delay. Table 5 of Part II gives the
details of the works, compared to the appraisal estimate. The project rehabilitated 64 pit-
latrines instead of 165. Three technical facilities had been forecast at appraisal, but it
was deemed preferable to build only one central technical facility, in order to centralize
the maintenance of CUD's infrastructure. To make up for the delay accumulated from
the beginning of the project, the construction of this technical center was delegated to
AGETIP, who performed well.
28.   Finally, under the project, a transportation and traffic division was created within
the technical department. This sub-component financed training sessions, in Canada, for
several high level engineers who implemented an urban data system on the CUD's
territory.  The objectives of this component were largely achieved, because the
institutional strengthening was satisfactory, and the physical realizations almost reached
the appraisal estimates.
(iii) Traffic and Public Transport Improvement
29.   The project financed a four year technical assistance to the Traffic Bureau within
the Transport Ministry, which was transferred to CUD during the project.  The
rehabilitation of CUD's main collector roads (68 Iam) was carried out satisfactorily, from
August 1990 to April 1991. The average speed increased by 10 to 20 points, and the
implementation of public lighting improved safety. The rehabilitation of the Niayes road
and the widening of Avenue Blaise Diagne had also a considerable positive impact on
traffic, as well as the Central Dakar's Traffic Management Plan, under which most of the
streets of the business center, the "Plateau", were rehabilitated.
30.   This component was delayed by the Government's inability to regularly supply
counterpart funds to the project and to procure works efficiently. To make up for the
delays, some of the contracts were delegated to AGETIP. The devaluation of the CFA
franc, in January 1994, led to additional delays but increased the volume of work,
expressed in CFAF. In conclusion, this component achieved its objectives, because it
improved the road system and traffic.
(iv) Municipal Resource Mobilization
31.   The objective of this component was to provide the basis for improved issue and
collection of municipal taxes, through the implementation of a fiscal cadastre, which
allowed for a rapid and efficient identification of taxpayers and assessment of tax base.
The objective, specified in the Credit Agreement, Section 3.07, was to increase, by June
30, 1992, the annual revenues of local taxes by at least 40 per cent as compared to the
average annual local tax revenues of the years 1985 through 1987.



-9-
32.   This component was managed by an Implementation and Monitoring Committee
of the Fiscal Cadastre, established on September 12, 1988. Aerial photography was
carried out in 1989, then photogrammetric restitutions and systematic field surveys
started in June 1990, covering 95,000 plots. Unfortunately, the fiscal cadastre did not
cover the whole greater Dakar area, but only residential areas: 50,264 properties were
registered in a computerized land data base, used for tax billing. The main difficulties
are related to tax collection: (a) the addressing system did not cover all the plots, and
numerous bills were returned; and (b) the collection staff decreased from 1 agent for
3,493 taxpayers in 1991 to 1 for 5,321 in 1994.
33.   The impact of this component is fundamental for the future of CUD, since project
sustainability depends on the improvement of municipal tax collection. Unfortunately,
the Treasury Directorate has not been able to provide reliable statistics on tax billing and
collection from 1985 to 1996, data which is necessary to assess the impact of the fiscal
cadastre. Information provided is partial, concerning only some taxes, or some years.
Nonetheless, tax billing in 1992 for the land tax, the property tax and the garbage tax, is
47 per cent above tax billing for 1987 and 1988. A Bank supervision mission, in April
1994, estimated at 44.5 per cent the increase of tax collection for 1992, as compared to
these of 1987 and 1988.
34.   The following table gives the amounts of tax billing and collection from 1990 to
1994, for the municipalities of Dakar Center, Cerf-Volant, Pikine, Guediawaye and
Rufisque, in CFAF billion:
1990   1991    1992    1993   1994
Property Tax           3.39    3.53     3.48    4.20    4.20
Poll Tax               8.67    8.55     8.48   10.13    9.75
Garbage Tax            1.34    2.19     3.05    2.03    2.22
Total:                 13.4   14.3    15.0   16.4   16.2
Poll Tax + TOM only    10.0   10.7    11.5   12.2   12.0
Collection PT+TOM      5.09    5.29     5.08  11.2 for 2 years
Collection rate      50.8%   49.2%    44.1 %      49.3%
35.   The improvement is not important, but it is worth noting that these figures
concern only 50,264 plots out of 95,000 plots surveyed. On all the plots, tax billing
should increase by 50 per cent. As regards tax collection, a lot still has to be done. In
conclusion, this component partially achieved its objective to give CUD the possibility to
increase its tax revenues, because a great effort is done to improve tax collection.
(b) Housing
(v) Land Development Program
36.   The Land Development Corporation, SCAT-URBAM, was created on May 22,
1988, as a condition of credit effectiveness. Its statutes specify, article 5 - Subject: "to



-10-
achieve its objectives, the company collects and receives down payments and savings
from individuals and legal entities applicants for the acquisition of plots developed by the
company". SCAT-URBAMs actions were not only incompatible with the Senegalese
legislation but also conflicted with project design. This was the main cause of failure of
this component; a land development corporation should not play a financial role, when
there is an efficient and experienced housing bank.  It is a confusion in the
responsibilities which led numerous development companies to bankruptcy.
37.   Five sites had been identified, free from illegal settlements and owned mainly by
the State at Grand Yoff, Patte d'Oie, M'Bao and Rufisque. BHS did not accept the
financing terms for Grand Yoff because SCAT-URBAM required each applicant to pay
65 per cent of the cost of the plot thus preventing BHS from mobilizing these savings.
Therefore, SCAT-URBAM completed, from 1990 to 1992, 1,300 plots on Grand Yoff,
using only the savings of its customers. The development of the other sites was delayed
by problems of land acquisition and illegal settlements. Since April 1994, SCAT-
URBAM developed 3,500 plots on the Hann-Maristes site. The first phase of 1,050 plots
is completed. The agency has therefore completed 2,350 plots in 7 years, i.e. 350 per
year, as compared to the 1,800 forecast at appraisal.
38.   As in the majority of land development projects, the standard of the plots is
higher than forecast at the beginning. Therefore, the low income target population did
not have access to these plots, and even middle income families faced difficulties.
Because of the long delays in the completion of these operations, SCAT-URBAM was in
a critical financial situation, and a recapitalization has been necessary. The strategic
mistakes could have been avoided if the Steering Committee had efficiently monitored the
SCAT-URBAM operations.
39.  In conclusion, SCAT-URBAM did not achieve the objectives for which it had
been established. Nevertheless, the creation of this corporation was needed. Its strategy
should be redefined and its collaboration with BHS reinforced, the latter only carrying
out the financial duties.
(vi) Housing Loans of BHS
40.   Proceeds of the IDA Credit financed housing sub-loans through a CFAF 4 billion
loan from the Government to BHS, at the Central Bank privileged discount rate (6 per
cent at that time), with a maturity of 25 years, including a 10 year grace period. BHS
was to use these funds to grant housing loans to purchasers or self-help builders for the
production of low cost and medium standard housing, with the accent on self-help
builders. In 1988, BHS was financing, on the average, 1,000 housing units per year, and
the objective was to increase its annual lending from 1,000 to 1,500 units. This objective
was hindered by the restrictions, imposed by the Central Bank, in BHS's annual increase
of outstanding loans. The IDA Credit providing external resources, the loans financed by
the project were authorized beyond these limitations.



41.   The number of loans increased but did not surpass 1,402 per year. This was due
to the devaluation which increased the projects' costs, and to the rise of interest rates
which brought down the households' solvability. Nevertheless, these loans were largely
awarded to very low cost and low cost housing. In particular, 2,033 loans out of 8,653,
i.e. 23.5 % were awarded to self-help builders, which is an excellent result.  In
conclusion, this component has achieved its objectives.
E. PROJECT'S SUSTAINABILITY
42.   The project had a partial impact on municipal institutions and especially on
municipal finance, key to project's sustainability. The CUD's Technical Department has
been strengthened, in capacity and equipment, which should enable them to efficiently
manage the CUD's infrastructure. The fiscal cadastre provided the CUD and the
Treasury with an efficient tool which, if these institutions make an effort to improve the
tax collection, should considerably increase the tax revenues. Since this is the condition
of sustainability for the works financed by the project, one can conclude that the project's
sustainability is likely.
F. BANK PERFORMANCE
43.   The project's preparation was too short, from January 1986 to July 1987, which
delayed the start up of the project, because the final design was not ready for any of the
components. The conditions of disbursement for categories 1 and 2 of Schedule 1 of the
Credit Agreement were unnecessarily complicated, which made the application very
difficult. The supervision of the project by the Bank was satisfactory. There were two
rmissions per year, except in 1991 and 1993 with only one. The start up of the project
was difficult because, until 1992, there was no engineer, neither in the Bank team nor in
the project unit. On the whole, there were fifteen supervision missions. Finally, three
task managers were involved over a period of eleven years, which is very reasonable.
44.   At the approach of the Credit closing date (with the threat of cancellation of 40%
of the Credit amount), the Bank was able to sensitize the Government and to mobilize the
Project Unit: a clear and precise identification of the Credit's extension conditions, and a
rigorous action plan changed the course of the project. In addition, new work procedures
were established: (a) regular preparation of quarterly action plans; (b) almost daily
communications between the project director and the Bank; (c) missions of the project
team to Washington, in addition to the Bank supervision missions; and (d) delegation to
AGETIP for the implementation and monitoring of some public works sub-components.



- 12 -
G. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
45.   The Borrower's performance was mixed. The Government was responsible for
delays in implementation, because counterpart funds were not made available in
accordance with the Credit Agreement. All the projects faced this issue, at that time,
because of the bad economic performances of Senegal.
46.   The performance of the Project Unit, implementing agency, can be deemed
satisfactory. As mentioned above (para. 44), for fear of wasting 40 per cent of the Credit
amount at the initial closing date, the Project Unit was able to show a new dynamism and
relaunch the project. In particular, the action plan, prepared in cooperation with the
Bank, was rigorously respected. There were two project directors between 1987 and
1990, but the third one, appointed in August 1990, stayed in the same position until the
Credit closing date, on January 31, 1997. This continuity was beneficial to the project.
The absence of an engineer at the project unit was a cause of delay at the start-up of the
project. The quarterly progress reports and weekly progress notes were submitted very
regularly to the Bank until the end of the project. In accordance with the Credit
Agreement, the project's accounts were audited each year by independent auditors,
acceptable to IDA. The audit reports were regularly submitted to IDA, sometimes with
some delay. They always certified the accounts of the project.
47.   The initial delay of about two years could have been reduced if the Senegalese
procurement procedures were not so cumbersome. It is not good practice to approve a
contract two years after the invitation to bid, or to sign another contract 14 months after
bid opening.
H. ASSESSMENT OF PROJECT'S OUTCOME
48.   The project achieved its objectives in the institutional and financial aspects, and
the physical objectives were largely met. Therefore, the project's outcome can be rated
satisfactory.
I. FUTURE OPERATIONS
49.   The good results obtained with this third urban project justified pursuing the
fourth urban project, the Urban Development and Decentralization Program (UDDP),
appraised in April 1997, negotiated in September 1997, and presented to the Board on
November 20, 1997. This new project focuses on decentralization and proposes the
creation of a Municipal Development Agency, which will be the government-delegated
executing agency, but the physical components will be executed under delegated contract
management. All municipalities of Senegal will be eligible for the funds of this fourth
urban project.

J. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
50.   For a project to be manageable, it is crucial to keep it as simple as possible. This
project was highly complicated and therefore difficult to implement and supervise.
Components such as the fiscal cadastre are too complex and costly. Both costs and
complexities are often driven by suppliers eager to sell their high tech products.
51.   The Bank has a strong responsibility in enhancing coherence of approaches in the
same country. The initial failure of the MCF is partially due to the competition with
AGETIP (para. 50).
