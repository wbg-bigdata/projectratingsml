PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
FIFTH POWER PROJECT - (LOAN 1215-PE)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fifth Power
Project which was partially financed by Loan 1215-PE. The borrower was the
Government of Peru which utilized US$2.6 million of the proceeds to finance
the technical assistance component carried out by the Direccion General de
Electricidad (DGE), a Government Agency under the Ministry of Energy and
Minns. The remainder of the loan, or US$32.8 million, was reloaned by the
Government to Electrolima, the utility serving Lima, to help to finance the
distribution project of the latter for the period 1975-79. The Project was
completed in 1982, about three and one half years late. The PCR was prepared
by the Energy Division of the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office
based on information in the Bank files, a final project report prepared by
Electrolima, and discussions with staff of the Bank and Electrolima.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report
to the Borrower for comments; however, no comments were received.

1/ Project costs are understated due to the method of inventory valuation
employed by Electrolima (para. 3.11).
2/ Exchange adjustment favorable to the borrower: US$7.3 million.
3/ Except for three 60 kV transmission lines, two 60/10 kV substations and
the control center. The delayed completion reflected a lower-than-
expected demand increase, and inexperience in procurement matters and in
handling the procedures for selection of consultants (paras. 3.9 and
3.10).
4/ The less-than-expected level of return is due mainly to the fact that
tariff increases did not keep pace with cost increases (para. 4.2).

PERU
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
FIFTH POWER PROJECT - LOAN 1215-PE
Highlights
1.        The Loan 1215-PE (US$36.0 million equivalent)1/ helped to finance
training, consultant services for engineering design anU studies, and
distribution facilities, including transmission, substransmission and
distribution lines, substations, pole transformers, meters, communication and
control facilities. Electrolima succeeded in meeting its objectives of
providing facilities to meet system demand and also succeeded in connecting
about 90% of the low-income consumers estimated at appraisal (para. 4.1).
2.        Due to variations in the actual rates of growth of different load
centers from the rates expected at appraisal, Electrolima, with Bank
agreement, changed Part A of the Project by adding and cancelling, as
necessary, items such as substations and subtranamission lines. Likewise,
there was an enlargement in the scope of the studies included in the Part B
of the Project. However, the net effect on the physical quantities of the
project was minor. The cost of the project was lower than the original
estimate by 21%, but the cost is understated due to the method of inventory
valuation employed by Electrolima (para. 3.11).
3.        The Project was completed by the end of 1982, approximately three
and a half years later than the target completion date. The delay was partly
due to the lower-than-expected demand increase, and also to inexperience in
procurement matters and in consultant-selection procedures.
4.        Electrolima's financial performance during the period was weak as a
result of the Government's policy of not increasing tariffs in line with
costs. The issue of tariffs was addressed by the Bank in the processing of
Power VI and again has been raised in the context of the Engineering Loan
recently negotiated.
1/ Approximately US$0.6 million of the loan was cancelled.



PERU
FIFTH POWE-k PROJECT - LOAN 1215-Ps
I. BACKGROUND
Bank Lending to the Electric Power Sector
1.1       Since 1960 the Bank has made seven loans totalling $208.7 million
to Peru's power sector. The first four loans were to Electrolims, the
utility serving metropolitan Lima. The loans helped finance 220 NW of
hydropower as well as expansions to the transmission and distribution
systems.
1.2       The fIfth loan was for the Fifth Power Project (Loan 1215-PE) which
is the subject of this report. The loan principally halped finance
Electrolima's 1976-79 distributiton Program. The loan also helped to finance
a much smaller but important part of the project: technical assistance and
training components to assist Government entities in strengthening sector
organization and planning.
1.3     The sixth loan, amounting to US$25 million, was made in 1981
principally to finance prefeasibility and feasibility studies for 12
hydroelectric plants. The beneficiaries were Electroperu, Electrolima,
Hidrandina, and Centromin, a state-owned mining company, which has developed
its own electric power system.
1.4       The seventh loan, amounting to US$81.2 million, was made in 1982 to
help finance Electrolima's 1982-86 distribution program, construction of the
Yuracmayo dam and expansion of Huinco plant; Electroperu's final design for
the Mantaro transfer scheme which would increase its hydro production,
and Hidrandina's final design for the Mayush hydro project.
Organization of the Electric Power Sector
1.5       A 1972 Electricity Law reserved to the Government the
responsibility for public service electricity supply, provided for Government
participation in the ownership of existing private utilities and provided for
interconnection of power systems. The 1972 Law also created Electroperu
which was made responsible for planning, design, construction and operation
of all new generating facilities larger than 10 MW and for the development
and construction of the transmission network. However, Electroperu was
unable to carry out efficiently its responsibilities.
1.6       In 1982 a General Electricity Law was passed.  The Law called for a
decentralization of the power sector. Pursuant to the Law, eight new
regional utilities have been created on the basis of either existing
utilities (Electrolima, Hidrandina, Coserelec, Seal) or former Electroperu
regional units. Under t1ie 1982 Electricity Law, regional utilities have the
responsibility for developing regional generation works (smaller than 500 NW
of installed capacity), transmission and distribution networks, and marketing
electricity. Electroperu is to be in charge of (a) the preparation



- 2 -
of Power Master Plans; (o) the construction and operation of power projects
and transmission lines involving two or more regional companies and power
projects with 500 MW or more installed capacity; and (c) supervision of
regional companies.
1.7       The Ministry of Energy and Mines through the Direccion General de
Electricidad (DGE), is in charge of the regulation of the power sector in all
aspects except those related to tariffs. A Tariff Commission handles tariff
matters and regulates the Compensation Fund for Generation. 1/
1.8       The sector organization is promising but still ieak.  The regional
companies inherited deteriorated plants and networks, weak system for
billing, collection and administration, and poorly trained personnel. Losses
in some of the distribution networks are extremely high and reliability
extremely low. Through Loan 2179-PE the Bank has already provided assistance
for training for staff of the regional utilities. A new loan under
negotiation, the Power Engineering Loan, provides assistance for studies.
All these efforts are expected to help improve the efficiency of the sector.
The Beneficiaries
1.9       Electrolima was the major beneficiary of the loan. Formerly a
privately ownpd company known as Empresas Electricas Asociadas. The
Government controlled Electrolima since 1973. Electrolima is the best
managed of the regional distribution companies in Peru.
1/ The compensation Fund for Generation is a mechanism created to transfer
financial resources between regions to average-out generation and
transportation costs and allow greater uniformity in electricity tariffs
to final consumers.

II. PROJECT ORIGIN, APPRAISAL, PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND NEGOTIASIONS
Project Origin and Appraisal
2.1       The Bank staff first appraised the Project in March 1973 based on
the preparation work carried out by Electrolima's staff. The Project
originally covered the period 1973-77. Information on the firt appraisal has
been lost from the Bank files. Because of Electrolima's delay in taking
actions on tariffs and on the refinancing of short-term debt (which the Bank
sought), the implementation period was shifted to 1976-79. The project was
reappraised in July 1975, after Electrolima had taken actions on tariffs and
on the refinancing of the short-term debt mentioned above.
Project Description
2.2       The agreed Project consisted of the following:
ELECTROLIMA components (Part A)
a.    Transmisson andl subtransmission:
(i) 26 circuit-km of 220 kV and 125 circuit-km of 60 kV line
extensions;
(ii) constructioti, expansion and/or improvement of six 220/60 kV
substations and qf seventeen 60/10 kV substations.
b.    Distribution:
(i) Installation of about 2,300 transformers, 10,000/220 V, with an

Negoti.tion
2.3       Negotiations took place on January 26-30, 1976, without any
significant problems. The loan was approved on March 2, 1976 and signed on
September 20, 1976, for a term of 20 years including three years of grace and
a rate of interest at 8.5% p.a. There was a six months delay between the
approval of the Loan and its signature, due to slow authorization of the Loan
Agreement by the Government.

III - INPLEMENTATION
Effectiveness and beginMni of the works
3.1       The loan became effective on November 18, 1976 five months later
than expected during appraisal. This delay was due to the slow authorization
of the Loan Agreement by the Government (para. 2.3).
3.2       Implementation of the Project began as planned (April 1976);
however, due to inexperience there were procurement problems and delays in
the engagement of consultants. This did not allow the Project to proceed in
a timely manner, specially the parts related to the studies (paras. 3.9 and
3.10).
Changes in the projects
3.3       The original project was changed mainly as a result of variations
in the rate of growth at different load centers. The 60 kV lines
Balneario-Jorge Chavez, Pershing-Pando, Persing-San Isidro were excluded from
the project, and there were added Balnearios-Barranco, Moyopampa-Chosica,
Barsi-Pando and Entrada Pershing. Likewise, the 60/10 kV substations, Jorge
Chavez, Chorrillos, San Isidro, Tacna and Mirones were excluded from the
project and Barranco and Chosica were added.
3.4       As regards the studies included in the project, Electrolima
obtained the Bank's agreement to undertake a new study on procurement
practices, which was only completed to its first phase; the second phase, for
implementing the recommendations, was cancelled by Electrolima because of
financial constraints and the desire to carry out the second phase with a
foreign individual consultant, an arrangement that was considered by them to
be more effective and economical. The Bank agreed to include the second
phase in the Sixth Power Project (Loan 2179-PE), which was under
consideration at that time; however, the study has not been implemented yet.
The Bank has been pressing Electrolima to fulfill its commitment.
Project Timetable
3.5       The project was completed, except for three 60 kV transmission
lines, two 60/10 kV substations, and the control center, by the end of 1982,
approximately three and a half years later than the target completion date
(Annex 2). The delay was partly due to the lower-than-expected demand
increase, and also to inexperience in procurement matters and in the
administrative procedures for selecting consultants (paras. 3.9 and 3.10).
3.6       The 60 kV transmission lines nct yet completed at the end of 1982
were San Juan-Chorrios, Barsi-Pando and Moyopampa-Chosica and the two 60/10
kV substations were Pando and Chosica. The control center was commissioned
at the middle of 1983.
l



-6-
3.7       The project included a training component for Electrolima and the
Direccion General de Electricidad (DGE)2/. Electrolima's component provided
for the training of operational staff in the maintenance of hot overhead
lines. Electrolima accomplished this task by sendi tg six technicians to be
trained by the supplier who was awarded the contr i to supply the tools to
work with hot overhead lines, and by hiring one expert from the same firm to
give training courses in Lima. The Bank agreed as well to finance from the
loan account the training of three engineers in software and hardware for the
telecontrol system. The project also provided for the training of sector
personnel in operation, planning and administration of large public utility
enterprises, but due to a lack of information from DGE and weakness in the
supervision of this project component, the Bank staff was unable to evaluate
the results.
Procurement of Goods and selection of consultant
3.8       According to the loan agreement, goods, works anc services would be
procured under international competitive bidding, and consultants would be
selected "sing procedures satisfactory to the Bank. The loan also allowed
retroactive financing of US$1.1 million for equipment and material that
Electrolima purchased for the project after July 1, 1975. Even though local
industry could supply some of the equipment and materials, the loan did not
provide any margin of preference for local suppliers.
3.9       Procurement was one of the causes for the delay in the execution of
the Project. On the one hand, even though this was the fifth loan to
Electrolima, the last loan had been made ten years previously and staff were
not familiar with the changes that had taken place in the Bank procurement
guidelines. Frequent correspondence to clarify points related to bid
invitations and to settle matters produced by inadequate evaluation and award
reports was required. On the other hand, the Government was extremely strict
in the application of regulations that protect local manufacturers, even
though in many cases this required purchasing goods of lower quality at
higher prices, and Electrolima had to finance these purchases with its own
resources. As Electrolima awarded three contracts to firms who were not the
lowest evaluated bidders, the Bank considered these awards as misprocurement
and cancelled US$371,421 from the loan account. Besides advising the
Government and Electrolima on procurement matters by normal correspondance
and during routine supervision missions, in May 1977 the Bank sent a
procurement engineer to advise Electrolima on procurement matters. There was
an improvement in the handling of procurement, specifically near completion
of the Project. Likewise, the Bank has continued cooperating recently in
strengthening the procurement area, and to this end a seminar was organized
by the Bank in Lima in August 1984 in which high level Government officials
participated.
2/   The Direccion General de Electricidad is the unit of the Ministry of
Energy and Mines that was responsible to carry out the Part B of the
Project.



- 7 -
3.10      The selection and engagement of consultants, especially in relation
to Part B of the project, also delayed ptoject execution. This was basically
due to lack of experience of Electrolima and the Direccion General de
Electricidad (DGE) with Bank's procedures. In the case of DGE, another
reason was the frequent changes in the management and staff (DGE had five
different directors during project execution). It also appears that delay
was due to scepticism of DGE's management and staff as to the importance of
the studies, which had been included in the project but had had the
opposition of the DGE.
Project Cost
3.11      The final Project cost estimate, based on Electrolima data, is
US$107.9 million (Annex 3), 21X lower than the appraisal estimates. However,
this cost is understated. Some adjustments were made to the foreign cost
component using disbursement data, but the local cost component is
understated due to tile method of inventory valuation employed by
Electrolima.3/
3.12      The cost issue was not addressed with sufficient attention by the
Bank during the implementation period of the Project, and is likely to arise
again in the projects under implementation (Power VI). The Bank should
discuss this problem with Electrolima and seek changes in accounting policy.
3.13      Annex 4 shows that the actual and forecast loan allocation by
categories were close, except for consultants' services, for which the final
figures were 83% higher than the estimates. This was mainly due to
enlargement in the scope of some studies. Annex 5 shows the disbursements
lagged behind the appraisal estimates, which reflects the delays in project
execution discussed in paras. 3.9 and 3.10.
Performance of consultants, contractors and suppliers
Consultants
3.14      Electrolima's staff carried out the project engineering design and
construction supervision, and hired consulting firms to carry out the studies
of communication and control system, procurement practices, and planning,
design, operation and maintenance of the distribution system. The work of
the consultants was generally considered satisfactory by Electrolima and the
Bank. However, Electrolima cancelled the second phase of the procurement
practices study (para. 3.4), and as far as the third study is concerned
(planning, design, operation and maintenance of distribution system),
Electrolima's staff felt that the results were not as expected because the
study covered too many areas and there were many specialists involved,
causing lack of coordination. With both consultants for the studies
mentioned above, glectrolima had to settle differences regarding billings,
which were finally solved satisfactorily.
3/   Electrolima values its inventories at average cost, which due to
inflation is significantly lower than the cost of the last purchase.
They do not revalue their inventories to reflect inflation.



- 8 -
3.15      The Bank does not have an opinion from DGE regarding the
per'ormance of the consultants hired for undertaking the studies under Part B
of the Project: power market, hydropower assessment, thermal stations
catalogue, master plan, organization and tariffs. Bank staff who supervised
the project considered the work of the consultants to be satisfactory, except
the work of the consultant related to the sector organization study. This
study was severely criticized by DGE and the Bank and needed the issuance of
various draft versions in order to fulfill the requirements of both entities.
Contractor and supplier
3.16      The contractors and suppliers had a satisfactory performance, but
there were some problems with deliveries. The longest delay was experience
with the telecontrol system. The equipment was received 10 months later than
the original schedule. The manufacturer offered additional hardware and
software to compensate ElectroLima for the delay, an arrangement that was
acceptable to Electrolima and the Bank. Minor delivery problems were faced
with manufacturers who supplied the 60 kV blades, the 10 kV circuit breakers,
and the measurement transformers.
Participation of Other Financing Agencies
3.17      During project implementation, the German Agency for Technical
Cooperation (GTZ) agreed to finance the optimization study included as part
of the Master Plan. There was a successful cordination between GTZ and the
Bank in dealing with this project component.

IV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Electrolima's load
4.1       The main objective of the Project was to provide Electrolima with
the distribution facilities needed to meet the increased demands on the
system, including the demand of a large influx of lower-income population
living in new communities, "pueblos jovenes', in Lima's outskirts.  The
Project was adequate in meeting its objectives because even though lower than
expected economic growth was experienced during the period 1975-1979 actual
energy sales and connections to low-income consumers were approximately 90%
of the target figure, and the system was capable of meeting the demand
approximately two years ahead of the original forecast. Without the Project
the country would have faced rationing.
Return on Investment
4.2       It was not possible to estimate the return on the Project because
the borrower did not supply the data on annual construction expenditures for
the Project. Furthermore, a rate of return on a project of this nature would
have little meaning, and the procedure currently followed by the Bank for
distribution projects is to focus on the investment program as a whole. Bank
staff estimated the financial rate of return on the construction program for
the period 1975-1982, and it was 3.6% (Annex 6), which is lower than the
return estimated for the project during appraisal (8.4%). The reasons for
this low return are low incremental energy sales4/, failure of tariffs to
increase at the same pace as costs and higher-than-expected energy purchase
price from Electroperu. Of these, the failure of tariffs to increase at the
same pace as costs was the main cause for the lower-than-expected return on
investment. Chapter V contains details on the Bank's effort to influence
Government policy in this respect during the period of project implementation
(1975-82), and more recently, in the context of the Engineering Loan
negotiated.
4/ At appraisal, the incremental sales forecast for the period 1975-79 were
2,445 GWh, which may be compared with an actual figure of 1,279 GWh (48%
lower).

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Comparison of Actual and Forecast Data
5.1       Annexes 7 to 10 compare the actual and appraisal forecast key
financial ratios, income statement, sources and application of funds and
balance sheet for the period 1975-82. Electrolima's financial performance
during that period was weak. Actual ratios for rate of return, debt-service
coverage, contribution to expansion and debt-equity were below expected
levels. Likewise, energy sales were lower than foreca3ted due to economic
recession.  Energy losses were higher than estimated.   The rate of return
was similar to the forecast during the period 1975-80, but deteriorated
significantly in 1981 and 1982 (4.8% and 3.2% respectively). Contribution to
expansion ratio was lower than the covenanted 30Q for 1976 and 45% in
subsequent years, showing negative actual figures for 1979 and 1980, but
improving somewhat for 1981. The deterioration of these key financial
indicators was mainly due to failure by the Government to increase tariffs
adequately at a pace to offset cost increases. In December 1975 prices,
tariffs increased from SI. 1.35/kWh in 1975 to S/. 1.72/kWh in 1982, and
operating costs from SI. 1.12/kWh in 1974 to SI. 1.68/kWh in 1982. The rate
of growth was faster for operating costs, particularly in 1981 and 1982.
5.2       Eletrolima did not comply with the revenue covenant for Loan
1215-PE.  During project supervision the Bank expressed to the Government and
Electrolima its concern about the evolution of costs and tariffs and pressed
for higher and more systematic tariff increases. This issue was also
addressed in the context of Loan 2179-PE negotiated in 1982, by which the
Government agreed to increase steadily the rate of return from 4% in 1982 to
12% in 1985. The Government made reasonable efforts to accomplish this, but
due to economic and political problems it did not succed in fulfilling its
commitment.
5.3       Other aspects that contributed, though to a lesser degree, to the
financial deterioration of Electrolima are the high system losses and
increase in the number of employees. During the Project implementation,
system losses were one percent over the SAR's target of 9%, and showed a
tendency to increase in recent years (10.6% in 1982). The number of
employees was about 5% higher than the SAR expectation.
5.4       Even though Electrolima's construction program lagged behind the
forecast, because of lower demand, Electrolima had funding problems; and had
to cover its cash gap basically through short-term borrowings.
5.5 The issues of tariffs and efficiency in the electric sector have
recently been reviewed by the Bank in the context of an Engineering Loan
recently negotiated.  There is a Government commitment to seek tariff
increases of 2% in real terms per month over a period of the next two years.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND ORGANIZATION
rhe Government and the Beneficiary
6.1       Annex 11 describes the major covenants of the Loan and Project
Agreement. Compliance with these covenants on the part of the Government,
the Direccion General de Electricidad and Electrolima was generally
satisfactory, except with respect to the tariff covenants, the extreme delay
in the engagement of consultants (para. 3.10) and lack of progress reports on
part B of the project.
6.2       Electrolima has enjoyed a history of good management and
administration. With respect to the project its performance was
satisfactory, except for the initial procurement problems which were
overcome.
6.3       By holding down tariffs, the Government has tended to weaken the
financial strength of Electrolima. This issue was addressed by the Bank in
the processing of Power VI and again has been raised in the context of the
Engineering Loan recently negotiated (para. 5.5). The Bank expects to review
the rate of return commitment on a realistic tariff policy with the new
administration of Peru after it takes office and completes its assessment of
sector finances.
The Bank
6.4       The Bank staff successfully contributed to the implementation of
the project by responding quickly to requested changes to the project (para.
3.3), by advising Electrolima and DGE on procurement matters (para. 3.9) and
by pressing the Government to take actions on tariffs and other financial
matters, even though it did not fully succeed in this task. However, the
Bank staff failed to suggest changes in the loan agreement to provide a
reasonable margin of protection to local industry (para. 7.1.1) and to press
DGE to supply the quarterly reports on part B of the project (para. 6.1).



- 12 -
VII. LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
7.1       Specific lessons to be learned from the Fifth Power Project are:
7.1.1     In the early stages of the project, Bank staff had detected that
local industry was willing to participate in the project by
supplying equipment and materials. This was not taken into account
at appraisal and negotiations, and therefore no margin of
protection was provided. A modification of the loan agreement to
allow an adequate margin of protection might have satisfied the
concern of local industry and at the same time might have
diminished the procurement problems faced (as the Government might
then have exerted less pressure on Electrolima to depart from the
award procedures agreed with the Bank), but neither the Bank nor
Electrolima nor the Government presented suggestions to modi4 the
Loan Agreement on this ground.
7.1.2     The Bank should monitor the accounting procedures of its borrowers
to ensure that Project costs are recorded in a manner that would
allow comparison with the original estimates. Such manitoring
would allow detecting deficiencies in time and would allow the
borrower to correct them. 5/
5/ OED NOTE: Energy Department staff state, however, that, "The routine
development activity of a power utility as covered by the project
description, is always flexible and recognizes only that a certain
level of system growth is likely and will need to be served. Whilst
it is reasonable to require the project executioning agency to keep
auditable records of the materials procured using Bank funds, a-  to
demonstrate that they were applied to the system during the course
of project execution, for projects such as this that are not based on
detailed engineering and that involve the "bread and butter" activities
of a utility over a long period of time, it is not practical nor
reasonable to require that the Bank financed portion of the daily work
be identified and recorded in special accounts. Of the many projects
of this nature that the Bank has supported in the past it is not likely
that any conformed to the objective that paragraph 7.1.2 describes.
Furthermore, it would be exceedingly difficult to draw an-3 valid
inferences from a comparison of the final costs with the original
notional budget since only a very small part of the whole has been
defined in measurable detail."
"It is of concern that a finding such as this should lead to
our insisting that our borrowers undertake an exceedingly complex task
of dubious accuracy and of doubtful benefit to them or us."
