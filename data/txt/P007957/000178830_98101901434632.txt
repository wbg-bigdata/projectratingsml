APPRAISAL OF FIFTH POWER PROJECT - PERU
Summary and Conclusions
i.        This report appraises the fifth power project in Peru, for which
the government has requested financial assistance from the Bank.
ii.       Since 1960 the Bank has provided major financial assistance to
Peruvian power development through four loans to Electrolima, the utility
serving metropolitan Lima, totalling US$66.5 million. All four projects
have been successfully completed. However, Electrolima's financial per-
formance deteriorated in 1972-74, which led to delays in Bank processing
of its next loan application (see paragraph ix).
iii.      The fifth project's principal component would be Electrolima's
1975-78 distribution expansion program, for Which the government would on-
lend most of the proposed loan. This expansion program is needed to meet
increased demands on the utility's system, including the demands of a large
influx of lower-income population living in new communities (pueblos jovenes)
in Lima's outskirts. With Bank assistance, Electrolima would triple the
number of service connections in the pueblos jovenes by 1979 and increase
the percentage of Lima's population served to about 85%; almost 3C% of
Electrolima's total number of customers then would be residents of the new
communities. The project's estimated total and foreign financing requirements
are Us$147.2 and US$T.O million respectively, including a US$2.1 million tech-
nical assistance component (see paragraph v).
iv.       Before 1972 Peru's electric power sector was highly fragmented
consisting of many government, municipal and private utilities serving distinct
concession zones. Bank assistance to the sector was limited to loans to Electro-
lima, the largest utility, because of inter alia insufficient technical and
economic justification of other utilities' projects.
v.        With the formation of a central government utility - Electricidad
del Peru (Electroperu) - in late 1972, the government took initial steps to
consolidate the sector. It has continued this process by acquiring control
of all private utilities, including Electrolima, formerly known as Empresas
Electricas Asociadas. However, serious managerial and planning problems re-
main among the government's power agencies, and Bank assistance in resolving
them is provided in a US$2.1 million component of the proposed loan. This
technical assistance component would help the government improve division of
responsibilities and coordination among its agencies, establish a master plan
for future sector development, identify training needs of sector personnel
and complete tariff studies.
vi.       The proposed US$36 million loan would cover all but US$3 million of
-.he project's foreign financing requirement.  ElectrolimaIs total financing re-
quirements cLuring the project's construction period would amount to US$221.2
million. About g% of this total financing requirement would be covered by
Electrolima's net internal cash generation, customers' connection fees and
contributions from developers. The balance of Electrolima's financing require-
ments would be provided by the proposed loan and by US$55.8 million equivalent
in loans from the government development corporation and equity contributions by
the government via Electroperu.



- ii -
vii.      Consultants acceptable to the Bank would be engaged to:  assist
Electrolima in improving its planning and maintenance and in engineering for
its communication and control systems, and provide specialized training to
Electrolima staff; and to undertake the studies comprising the technical
assistance component for the government. Electrolima's staff will engineer
all other works included in the project and supervise their installation,
which will be performed by local contractors. It has ample experience with
similar works and is fully capable of successful project execution.
viii.     Procurement of Bank-financed items would be through international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Because of the
need to meet the system's requirements, Electrolima might contract for cer-
tain items of equipment prior to loan signing; retroactive financing of US$1.1
million is recommended for initial payments on these contracts.
ix.       The Bank appraised a previous version of Electrolima's expansion
program in early 1973. However, further loan processing was delayed until
1975 to permit resolution of the company's financial problems (principally
its need for higher tariffs and re-financing a large amount of short-term
debt).  With substantial re-financing in 1974 and tariff increases totalling
about 38% in the first half of 1975, the government has taken appropriate
steps to resolve the problems. Provisions in the proposed loan agreements
requiring asset revaluations, adjustment of tariff levels to produce cash
contributions to construction expenditures of at least 30% in 1976 and 45%
in each year thereafter, and limitations on Electrolima's future indebtedness
would provide the mechanism for further improvements in the company's financial
situation. Assuming that these provisions are complied with, Electrolima's
financial performance is expected to be satisfactory.
x.        Based on average tariff levels which would result from implementation
of the financial covenants (paragraph ix), the rate of return on project in-
vestment would be between 8% and 14%, depending on assumptions concerning the
incremental cost of electricity to the system. This broad range results from
the uncertainty regarding the future generation program which does not allow
an exact determination of the incremental cost of generating electricity.
xi.       The project would form a suitable basis for a US$36 million loan
with a term of 20 years including three years of grace. The loan would be
made to the Republic of Peru; US$33 9 would be onlent to Electrolima for its
distribution expansion program (paragraph iii).



APPRAISAL OF FIFTH POWER PROJECT - PERU
1. Introduction
1.01      This report appraises the fifth power project in Peru, for which
the government has sought Bank assistance. Electrolima, the concessionaire
for the metropolitan Lima area, (a Peruvian corporation, formerly known as
Empresas Electrica Asociadas, whose control recently passed to the government)
and the main beneficiary of the proposed loan, has received four previous Bank
loans totalling US$66.5 million, as detailed in annex 1; all four projects
have been successf'ully completed.
1.02      The project's principal component in monetary terms is Electrolima's
1975-78 distribution expansion program. The Bank originally appraised a pre-
vious version (Electrolima's 1973-77 program) in March 1973. However, further
loan processing was postponed until 1975 to permit resolution of Electrolima's
financial problems (principally its need for higher tariffs and re-financing
of a large amount of short-term debt). Electrolima's current expansion pro-
gram is necessary to meet increased system demand, including that caused by
a large influx of low-income population residing in new localities (pueblos
jovenes) in Lima's outskirts. The total and foreign financing reauirements
of the project are US$147.2 and US$39.0 million respectively. The proposed
US$36 million loan would finance all but US$3 million of Eiectrolimals
foreign exchange needs (see paragraph 3.05) and would include a US$2.1
million technical assistance component (see paragraph 1.04).
1.03      Future power lending to Peru would probably be to the principal
utility - Electricidad del Peru (Electroperu) - where the needs for Bank
financial and technical assistance will be greater than in Electrolima.
The Bank has not previously been able to assist in sector development other
than through its loans to Electrolima because of insufficient technical and
economic justification of other utilities' projects. By creating the national
electric utility - Electroperu - in 1972, the government has begun the process
of sector consolidation. However, basic planning and managerial problems re-
main, and Bank assistance in resolving them is included in the proposed loan.
1.04      As summarized in paragraphs 2.04-06, the division of responsibility
between Electroperu and the Direccion General de Electricidad (DGE;) of the
Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) is unusual and the coordination between
them, inadequate. The proposed loan includes a US$2.1 million technical assist-
ance component as a first step to help the government improve sector organi-
zation, establish a master plan for future power sector development, identify
the training needs of sector personnel, provide funds for part of the recom-
mended training and carry out tariff studies. While the technical assistance
component of the proposed loan would initiate the resolution of sector prob-
lems, continued effort will be necessary if the various government agencies
which have responsibility for the sector are to achieve necessary improvements
in technical and managerial standards.
1.05      This report is based on a feasibility study of Electrolima's 1975-78
expansion program prepared by the utility, on discussions between various Bank,
MEM, DGE, Electroperu and Electrolima officials and staff members in 1973-75
and on the findings of an appraisal mission composed of Messrs. John E. Graves,
Rafael A. Moscote and Philip Owusu, which visited Peru in July 1975.

2. The Sector
Energy resources
2.01      The main source of commercial energy is petroleum, which accounted
for 77% of all commercial sources in 1972. Peru now produces about 67% of
its needs, mostly in the coast and adjacent offshore sites. As new fields in
the Amazon basin are developed, this situation is likely to change. Even
though discoveries in the area have been less than expected previously and
several foreign oil companies have terminated their drilling operations, the
government still hopes that the country will become self-sufficient by 1977
and a net exporter by 1978, when an 850 km pipeline to the port of Bayovar
is expected to be finished.
2.02      Preliminary investigations have revealed the existence of important
coal deposits in the north. Kopex, a Polish consulting firm, has estimated
an economic reserve of 270 million metric tons of coal in Alto Chicama. Of
these, about 60 million tons are considered by Kopex as proven reserves. On
the basis of these investigations, the government has engaged the same con-
sultants for further investigations leading to determining the feasibility
of installing a coal-fired thermal station in the early 1980s.
2.03      Peru is well-endowed with hydroelectric resources.  In 1972, the
latest year for which complete data are available, about 18% of all energy
used in the country and about 72% of all electric energy generation had this
origin. The government has stated a policy of substitution for petroleum
products in the generation of electric energy and expects to increase the
hydroelectric generation by implementing several hydro projects (see para-
graphs 2.14-15).
Sector organization
2.0o      The power sector is undergoing a major transformation, as detailed
in annex 2. Before 1972, it consisted of a number of private, municipal and
State-owned utilities, the largest of which was Electrolima, serving distinct
concession zones and regulated by State agencies. No national sector plan-
ning or coordination existed.  Captive plants serving large mining and industrial
installations were not interconnected with public-service systems. The
Normative Electricity Law of 1972 provided for State control of the sector
by creating a single State enterprise - Electroperu - and increasing State
participation in and control of all other utilities. The draft general
electricity law anticipates that all utilities will be consolidated into
Electroperu at an unspecified future date.
2.05      At present, an inefficient distribution of responsibilities between
the several State entities, a lack of coordination between them, and a lack
of experience and/or qualifications among personnel responsible for sector
planning may lead to uneconomic sector development. The most unusual feature
of the arrangement is DGE's assumption of responsibility for sector planning
and project selection without significant participation by Electroperu,leav-
ing to Electroperu only the execution and operation of the selectecd projects.
This is contrary to accepted utility practice. An operating agency is by its
nature in a better position than a ministry to plan its future development



-3-
because of its more direct contact with the market, its more thorough know-
ledge of field and operating conditions, and its greater familiarity with the
capability of its own system and personnel. Both DGE and Electroperu have
prepared their own market forecasts and lists of future projects. Neither
of their efforts provides a satisfactory master plan because their market
forecasts are unreliable (see paragraph 2.13), the comparability of the pro-
jects is doubtful and there is no adequate overall survey of the country's
hydro resources to serve as a basis for selecting the priority of future
projects.
2.o6      As a first step in resolving the situation, the loan includes funds
for consultants to study the sector's organization, establish a master plan
of future works and identify the sector's training needs (see paragraph 3.04).
The government has agreed to engage such consultants by March 30, 1977.
Regulation and tariffs
2.07      As described in annex 3, electric utilities are effectively regu-
lated by DGE following the guidelines set forth in the draft general electri-
city law, even though the 1955 regulatory law (Ley de la Industria Electrica
No. 12378) is supposed to be applicable until the general law is put into
effect. In contrast to the early 1970s, when Electrolima's tariff increases
were insufficient, regulatory treatment in 1975 with regard to overall tariff
levels has been satisfactory (see paragraph 6.01).
2.08      Electrolima's tariff structure, however, deserves further analysis.
TWhile its tariffs (summarized in annex 3) include some exemplary features,
such as discounts to encourage acceptance of service at higher vo-Ltage and
off-peak and lower rates for basic consumption of lower-income residents of
pueblos jovenes, they also include other features which may not stimulate
efficient energy consumption patterns. Principal among these are low resi-
dential and industrial rates, high commercial and general-use rates and high
connection fees and customer contributions. Because Electrolima's tariff
structure exemplifies the approach which DGE intends for nationwide applica-
tion, the proposed loan includes funds for studies to determine the incre-
mental cost of providing service to various customer classes and to propose
an alternative tariff structure which reflects marginal costs, assuming that
it is shown that the present one does not. The government has agreed to submit
proposed terms of reference for the study by June 30, 1976, to engage consul-
tants by January 31, 1977, and to discuss the study with the Bank prom.tly
upon its conclusion.            e
Electricity consumption and service to rural communities and "'pueblos jovenes"
2.09      The larger cities and towns have public-service electric systems
which account for about 60% of all electric energy used in the country, the
remainder being captive generation for mining and industrial purposes (details
are shown in annex 4). Access to electricity is limited in the urban poor areas
known as pueblos jovenes as well as in smaller villages and isolated rural
communities but it appears that a policy on access to service has yet to be
defined.

2.10      As summarized below, Peru's electricity market is predominantly for
mining and industrial purposes. This illustrates the importance of the power
sector to the economy, as these key sectors represent about 30% of GDP.

2.11      In metropolitan Lima, about 478,000 or 81% of the households had
public-service electricity supply in 1974. About 25% of the Lima households
are in the pueblos jovenes, of which in 1974 only some 55,000 households or
about 40% of the total had electric service. It is expected that by 1978,
about 18050r  households in the pueblos jovenes will have electric service
and that the total estimated residential customers will be 653,000 or 85% of
the projected population.
2.12      About 47% of the population of the country is rural.  In 1971, the
year before its incorporation into Electroperu, Servicios Electricos Nacionales
operated about 250 power plants with an average capacity of about 200 kW and
distributed about 120 GW. Electroperu has assumed responsibility for all
rural electrification and intends to electrify a number of new comnunities in
the next five years. However, it has yet to define the policies or goals of
an overall rural electrification program. According to the draft general law,
DGE will be given the responsibility for planning the rural electrification
program, but the draft does not specify the extent of coordination between DGE
and Electroperu.
Sector development
2.13      Peru has planned several mining and industrial projects with large
power and energy needs. This will undoubtedly have as a consequence major
demands on the power sector. According to the stated policy, Electroperu has
to provide for these requirements but in its planning efforts and those of MEM,
there is at present no distinction between the program that the sector should
carry out to meet its normal growth plus the firm power and energy requirements
of specific large industrial or mining projects, and the possible requirements
of other projects for which definite commitments have yet to be made. As a
result, there is no consensus as to what are the real requirements of the sec-
tor. Because of the physical separation of the planning function from the
operating entity (paragraph 2.05), the generation and transmission planning
and the priorities assigned to the different projects and to the required
studies are not always relevant, nor is the information obtained from the dif-
ferent sources reliable. Thus, the installation program changes very often.
As an example, at the beginning of 1975 sector authorities were convinced of
the need to install a 400 MW thermal station in the Central Region by 1977 or
1978 so as to avoid power shortages. Such a need had disappeared completely
by mid-1975.



- 5 -
2.14      Several other generating projects have been identified by Electroperu
and MEM for possible development to meet projected power demands in the
Central and Northern regions which include Lima and are the most important,
with 76% of the country's population and 87% of its energy generation (annex 4).
The MEM has developed a list of projects in which installation dates for these
projects have been proposed. However, there is no evidence that their proposed
order has been determined from a general study of several alternative projects
and realistic economic comparisons between them which would lead to a list of
priorities based upon economic and social consideration with due regard to the
power system's operating constraints.
2.15      The present total installation program envisages adding about 2,300 MW
to the north and central regions and about 700 MW in the rest of the country,
by 1984. The most advanced new projects, in terms of availability of data and
preliminary studies, to be in service in the north and central regions after
the expansion of the Mantaro hydro station from its present 342 MW to its
ultimate 798 MW, appear to be:
Project                Type                Size (MW)
Restitucion            hydro                  200
Sheque                 hydro                  600
Chicama                coal-fired             240
A brief description of these projects is included as annex 5.

3. The Project
The Electrolima program and project component
3.01      Electrolima serves its concession area with 220 kV and 60  kV double-
circuit transmission systems and 10, 30 and 60 kV distribution systems and a
220 V low-voltage system. The 30 kV voltage is being phased out. The project
includes the estimated requirements for the expansion of these systems from
1975 to 1978.
3.02      The Electrolima component of the project includes the following
major elements, described in detail in annex 6.
a.   Transmission and subtransmission:
i.   26 circuit-km of 220 kV and 125 circuit-km of 60 kV line
extensions;
ii.   construction, expansion and/or improvement of six 220/60 kV
substations and of seventeen 60/10 kV substations.
b.   Distribution:
i.   installation of about 2,300 transformers, 10,000/220 V, with
an aggregate capacity of about 233 MVA;
ii.   installation of about 1,000 circuit-km of 10 kV lines;
iii.   installation of 200,000 meters.
c.   Auxiliary services:
i.   expansion of the existing communications and control center;
ii.   auxiliary equipment for the data processing center;
iii.   laboratory, shop, transportation and maintenance equipmnent.
d.   Consultant services and training:  (25 man-months)
i.   consultant services for the expansion of the communications
and control center, for a review of distribution planning
standards and for hot-line maintenance of overhead distri-
bution and transmission lines; and
ii.   training of Electrolima personnel in hot-line maintenance of
overhead distribution and transmission lines.
3.03      Electrolima will continue expanding its system as required after
the project is completed. The most important future work is to close a 220 kV
loop towards which it has worked for a number of years and which will limit
the extent to which 60 kV is used as a transmission voltage. 60 kV will in the
future be used mostly for distribution. The project's 220 kV components would
form part of that loop (see map 11798).

Technical assistance for the government
3.04      The problems of sector coordination are serious (paragraph 2.05).
The project therefore includes intensive technical assistance to the govern-
ment (see annex 6 for details). The technical assistance component consists
of:
a.   a power sector organization study to be conducted under terms of
reference shown in the attachment to annex 6 and which would attempt
to suggest ways of improving the division of responsibi:Lities and
coordination between sector entities and identify sector training
requirements (25 man-months of consultants' effort);
b.   the preparation of a master plan for future generation and trans-
mission additions in the north-central interconnected system of
the country which would follow generally accepted practices and
would distinguish between firm and possible power requirements
and for which terms of reference are also shown in the attachment
to annex 6 (160 man-months);
c.   training of sector personnel in operation, planning and administra-
tion of large public utility enterprises; and
d.   tariff structure studies (10 man-months)
Estimated cost and financing
3.05      The project's estimated cost is US$137.32 million with a US$35.27
million foreign component. Total financing requirements, including interest
during construction (IDC) are US$147.]8 and US$39.Qmillion respectively.  The
pronosed loan would cover all the project's foreign financing requirements
exc^ent US$3 million of urgerntly-needed imported equioment which Electrolima
has contracted using procurement procedures not in accordance with the Bank's
g,uidelines .
3.06      The costs for the Electrolima component of the project were estimated
by Electrolima's technical p3rsonnel, based on information from recent bids and
quotations and were found to be reasonable by the Bank. The costs for the
technical assistance to the government were estimated by Bank staff. The costs
are detailed in annex 6 and summarized below:

3.07      A physical contingency allowance of 5% was assumed for aLl 220 and
60 kV components and of 10% for all remaining components. This was considered
sufficient because no major civil works are involved and finaldesigns are well
advanced for most project components.
3.o8      The base cost estimates shown in paragraph 3.06 are based on the
price levels prevailing at the beginning of 1976. Local and foreign price
contingencies estimated using the following annual inflation percentages have
been added:
International               Local
1976                         10                       12

1979                          7                        8
The percentagesused to calculate price contingencies for the local components
of the project are lower than the forecast general inflation rates for Peru
due to the fact that EEA has received informal quotations for most of the
equipment and services to be obtained that indicate that the lower percentages
are appropriate.



-9-
Engineering
3.09      Electrolima's own staff will carry out the engineering necessary
for execution of most parts of the project. This is acceptable as Electro-
lima has proven experience in similar works. Electrolima would agree to
engage consultants acceptable to the Bank for the purposes described in
paragraph 3.02 (d)(i).
Project execution
3.10      The execution of the project will be carried out as follows:
a.   Electrolima will request bids for materials and equipment and
will contract for the construction of all 60 and 220 kV lines
and substations. Electrolima's own personnel will commission
all lines and substations;
b.   the government should agree to engage consultants for the
technical assistance component of the project under terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank.
A project implementation schedule, which envisages completion of the project
by June 30, 1979, has been agreed upon and would be used to monitor project
execution (see annex 7).
Procurement and disbursement
3.11      The government would agree to follow the Bank policies and pro-
cedures for the utilization of consultants for the technical assistance
components of the project. All purchases by Electrolima for Bank-financed
equipment would be made following international competitive bidding (ICB)
in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Peruvian regulations
and high import duties (60-100%) effectively prevent ICB for equipment manu-
factured in Peru. About one-third of the project's cost represents locally-
manufactured equipment - distribution (10 kV and below) cables and transformers
and substation structures and accessory equipment. Similar imported equipment
would cost about 30% less than such non-competitive locally-manufactured equip-
ment, so that reserved procurement of these items has the effect of increasing
the project cost by about 10%. Purchase of locally-supplied equipment and
materials, not financed by the Bank, of over US$80,000 would be made after
local competitive bidding procedures; those under US$80,000 would be placed
directly with the supplier after a comparison of prices with at least two
other sources. This arrangement is satisfactory. While this equipment in-
cludes a small foreign exchange component (about h%), the latter has been
shown as local costs in paragraph 37)6 for clarity of presentation.
3.12      Disbursements from the loan account would be made for:
a.   the CIF cost of imported equipment and materials;
b.   the cost of consultant studies; and



- 10 -
c. financial charges on the Bank loan through October 14, 1979,
the day before the semi-annual repayment date preceding the
estimated closing date of the loan.
Estimated loan disbursements are shown in annex 8. Because of the ongoing
nature of transmission/distribution improvements, any unused loan balance
could be applied to system extensions similar to those included in the
project after consultation with the Bank.
3.13      In order to avoid delays in project execution, Electrolima would
purchase equipment and materials, such as cables and meters, prior to the
date of loan signing, to be financed by the proposed loan. Therefore, re-
troactive financing of up to US$1.1 million for payments made after July 1,
1975 has been agreed.
Environment
3.14      Electrolima has carried out its previous projects with due regard
to ecological and environmental factors and expects to do so with this
project. Most of its distribution system is underground because of, inter
alia, aesthetic reasons. As detailed in paragraph 4.05, there is some
question as to whether the aesthetic benefits and reduction in congestion
offset the higher costs associated with underground systems, so that the
project provides means whereby Electrolima may in due course decrease the
proportion of underground lines, with eventual resultant savings. The
company intends to route its overhead lines so as to minimize their visual
impact.
Project risks
3.15      While the price contingencies assumed ap-;'ar L- be sufficient,
further local inflation could result in cost increases beyond those fore-
cast. As noted in paragraph 6.04, Electrolima's financing plan includes
some cash build-up, which would cushion the impact of such further inflation.



- 11 -
4. Justification of the Project
Sector objectives
4.01      The Bank's objectives in lending for electric power development
in Peru are:
a.   to stimulate the government to organize the electric power
sector in the most efficient manner and define its financial
policy towards the sector in order to provide the necessary
institutional foundation for effective public utility operations;
and
b.   to provide for the training of key administrative, operative and
planning personnel in the sector in order to help Electroperu in
becoming an effective enterprise.
Project objectives
4.02      Besides assisting the government to formulate a progra-n to meet the
above goals and serve as a basis for further assistance, the project would
provide facilities to expand Lima's distribution system and thus meet future
demands for electricity in that city (which accounts for 35% of the national
market) without a reduction in the quality of service and would assist Electro-
lima in its planning and maintenance operations and its tariffs. The project
would be instrumental in making available public-service electricity to the
pueblos jovenes as Electrolima would build distribution facilities in them, in-
cluding the necessary substations and transmission lines. It is estimated that
the households in the pueblos jovenes with public-service electricity would in-
crease by about 230% by the end of 1978.
Demand and generation forecast
4.03      The average gro-th in the past 10 years has been 9.5% p a.  However,
the rate of growth has decreased to about 8.5% p.a. in the last five years.
Annex 9 gives details of both historical and forecast energy sales and maximum
demand for the Electrolima system. The projection, which assumes an average
8.3% p.a. rate of increase in sales of electric energy and in maximum demand,
is conservative and reasonable. Generation capacity appears to be adequate to
supply the projected growth, although there are unresolved problems regarding
future sector development (paragraphs2.13-2.15).
Size of the project
4.04      The project is of an adequate size to provide Electrolima with the
transmission and distribution facilities in Lima to enable it to satisfy the
expected increase in power and energy requirements without reduction in the
quality of service or investment in idle facilities. It will increase total
installed capacity in 220 and 60 kV transformers from 2 times the maximum
demand in 1974 to 2.2 times the maximum expected demand in 1979. The exist-
ing ratio has allowed Electrolima to provide satisfactory service but the
ratio will increase as 60 kV transmission is gradually replaced by 220 kV
transmission and 60 kV distribution. Electrolima has kept a relatively low
1.18 ratio of the total installed capacity in 10 kV transformer to peak demand.



- 12 -
At the end of the project, the ratio will have decreased to about 1.12 due
to expected increases in services at 60 kV.
Type of facilities
4.05      In most areas of the world, overhead transmission/distribution
systems are   usually lower-cost than underground, although new materials
and advances in underground construction methods have decreased the differ-
ential in recent years. Consideration of the non-quantifiable costs of
increased urban and suburban congestion and the detrimental aesthetic effects
associated with overhead systems has in many cases, however, resulted in a
preference for underground facilities. Because of Lima's unique climatic
situation - extremely dusty conditions caused by an almost total absence of
rain and a salt-laden atmosphere, combined with extremely high hurnidity -
Electrolima has demonstrated that the higher maintenance cost of overhead
facilities reduces their cost advantage and has opted for continuation of a
basically underground 10 kV distribution system with some overhead lines on
the outskirts of the city in the 1975-78 program. The project already in-
cludes a larger percentage of overhead lines than previous expansion programs
and the inclusion of consultant services for a review of the planling pro-
cess and of the weight given to the non-economic advantages of underground
lines and of training in hot-line maintenance of overhead lines as part of
the project, should eventually reduce the cost of maintaining the overhead
systems, reduce Electrolima's staff opposition to them and prepare the way
for future projects to have an increasing proportion of overhead lines,
thus reducing capital requirements and resulting in eventual savings.
h.o6      For most of the equipment included in the project, such as meters
or communication equipment, no reasonable alternative exists. Where alterna-
tives do exist, e.g. in routing of lines and location of substations, Electro-
lima has selected the least-cost solution which is compatible with safety
and aesthetic considerations.
Return on investment
4.07      It is difficult to determine the economic value of Electrolima's
incremental energy needs as Electroperu has not priced its sales to Electro-
lima on the basis of its costs to expand and operate the Mantaro plant, from
which these sales will be made. The uncertainty regarding the future pro-
gram (paragraphs 2.13-2.15) does not allow a reasonable calculation for the
cost of generating the required incremental energy at the other plants in-
cluded in the program. It is, however, possible to establish a range of
costs and from it determine a range of economic rates of return of the project.
4.08      The rate of return of the project as calculated on the basis of the
present purchase price of energy by Electrolima from Electroperu and the re-
commended Electrolima tariff is about 8.4%, while that obtained with the present
Electrolima tariff is about -2.2%. As shown in detail on annex 10, the rate of
return is quite sensitive to the cost of the incremental energy obtained by
Electrolima. As indicated below, the present purchase price is higher than the
probable incremental cost of electricity and therefore represents the maximum
economic value of this energy and hence, results the lowest rate of return.



- 13 -
If, for example, the purchase price is substituted by the incremental cost
of an alternative fuel-fired plant the rate of return rises to about 4.7%
at the present tariffs and to about 12.8% at the recommended tariff level.
At the estimated costs of the most probable next generation addition to the
system, the Restitucion project, the rates of return are about 6.8% and
14.4% respectively.
4.09      The rate of return of the project is less sensitive to variations
in the cost of the project, as also shown in detail in annex 10. An increase
of 20% in the project's costs would lower the rate of return to -)X.3% at the
present tariff level and to about 5.4% at the recommended level. A decrease
of the same magnitude in the project's costs would increase the rate of re-
turn to about 0.8% and 13% respectively.
4.10      The range of rates of return (8.4 to 14.4%) obtained at the recom-
mended average Electrolima tariff for sales to the public comrpares favorably
with the opportunity cost of capital for Peru. The above range is based on
efficiency prices, which in this case differ from market prices only by the
amount of import duties estimated at 10% of total costs, but use of market
prices would not effect the results materially.

5. The Beneficiary
5.01      The beneficiary of most of the loan would be Electrolima, the
public-service concessionaire for Lima and its environs. Electrolima was
formerly a privately-owned, Swiss-controlled company. The government
established control over it in 1973 by assuming ownership of the public-
domain assets managed by the company (annex 2). It has reached agreement
to acquire the holdings of the foreign interests which previously owned
21% of Electrolima's shares and has also finalized agreements with the local
holders of 25% of the shares. It now owns almost all of the company's shares,
mostly in Electroperu's name.
5.02      The government has also reached agreement with the Swiss interests
which controlled Energia Hidroelectrica Andina SA (Hidrandina), a company
formed in 1946 to provide bulk electricity to the Electrolima system. In
addition to the Moyopampa and Huampani hydro plants, all of TAhose generation
Electrolima purchases, Hidrandina also operates a separate concession north
of Lima.
Organization, management and staff
5.03      Electrolima is well organized (annex 11 shows the organization
chart), and its management and staff are competent to execute the project
and operate the system. The composition of the 15-man board of directors
reflects the change in Electrolima's control; all members are government
representatives, The board and the executive president (a new po3ition
created by the government-controlled board) control policy matters to a
much greater degree than previously, when a particularly forceful general
manager effectively controlled all aspects of the company. The inevitable
transitional problems associated with the change in control have not signi-
ficantly interfered with management's administration of day-to-day operations,
which reflects its capability. Most of the top management positions formerly
held by Europeans are now filled by Peruvians. The company's policy of
promotion from within, the depth of its middle management and supervisory
personnel, and its training program have served to provide sufficient manage-
ment continuity.
5.04      At the end of 1974, staff numbered 2,407 which represented 227 cus-
tomers/employee, up from 120 in 1964 and 180 in 1970. These ratios are indica-
tive of a high degree of efficiency. Several unions represent Electrolima's
employees; while competion among them has contributed to some differences of
opinion between management and the unions, the company has been able to re-
solve the issues without negative effect on the quality of service. The ef-
fect of the workers' community to be established by the general electricity
law (paragraph 15 of annex 2) cannot be determined at this time.
Market
5.05     WThile industrial consumption forms a smaller portion of Electrolima's
market than of electricity consumption in the entire country (paragraph 2.10),
it is still the largest factor in Electrolima's market. The relative market
shares of different consumer classifications are not expected to change signi-
ficantly during the project execution period, as summarized below:

5.o6      In 1974 Electrolima served 545,000 customers, 55,ooo of which were
in pueblos jovenes. In 1979 the total number of customers is expected to in-
crease to 770,000, and those in pueblos jovenes, to quadruple.  Eiectrolima's
quality of service has been good and is expected to continue so.
Management information systems and audit
5.07      Electrolima's internal management information system is good:
operating and financial reports are prepared accurately and promptly; and
customer records and accounting systems have been computerized. ]:ts financial
statements are audited by Moreno, Patifio y Asociados, which has a working re-
lationship with Price Waterhouse & Co. The proposed project agreement
would require audited financial statements and the auditors' report to be
transmitted to the Bank within six months of the end of Elpctrolima's fiscal
year. Electrolima has generally complied with this covenant in the nast.
Performance indicators
5.o8      Annex 12 shows a representative selection of indicators of Electro-
lima's marketing, operating and financial performance through the year follow-
ing project completion. Performance as measured by these indicators would be
monitored during project execution.

6. Finance
Summary
6.01      As detailed in annex 13, Peruvian regulatory authorities have
increased Electrolima's tariff levels sufficiently to enable the company to
achieve satisfactory financial results in 1975, in contrast to its unsatis-
factory performance in 1972-74. To assure that Electrolima's financial per-
formance continues to improve, it is provided in agreements related to the
proposed loan that the company would earn sufficient revenues to contribute,
from internal resourcesnot less than 3:% in 1976 and 45% in each year sub-
sequently, to its investment program. Attachment 1 to annex 13 contains
projections of Electrolima's key financial indicators, which are expected
to improve as a result of the utility's higher earnings and reduced dependence
on borrowing.
Tariff levels
6.02      Prior loan agreements with Electrolima have not included specific
covenants relating to tariff levels because the 1955 regulatory law and its
application were satisfactory. Because of the effective suspension of that
law (with respect to tariffs) and the lack of clarity of the normative and
draft general laws (annex 3), such covenants are provided in agreements re-
lated to the proposed loan. It is provided that Electrolima will apply for,
and the government will grant, tariff adjustments sufficient to enable Electro-
lima to contribute, from internal sources, to its expansion requirements at
least 30% in 1976 and 45% p.a. in subsequent years. To meet these covenants,
Electrolima will require increases of 11, 16, 10, 7 and 4% in its overall tariff
levels in each of the years 1976 through 1980. It has already applied for
1976 increases of about 16%; subsequent increases would be handled on a year-
by-year basis
6.03      Although more specific, the above provision is consistent with the
draft general law, which provides that the utility's rate of return (to be
determined by MEM - see paragraph 4 of annex 3) will enable it to contribute
to an expansion fund.    To establish a reasonable value for application
of the still-undetermined rate of return, MEM increased the value of Electro-
lima's rate base by 40% in 1975, thereby offsetting deficiencies in this
regard since 1968. Agreements related to the proposed loan provide for annual
revaluations of Electrolima's rate base.
Financing plan
6.04      Assuming that Electrolima and the government comply with the pro-
visions proposed above, Electrolima's project financing plan would be accept-
able. Net internal cash generation would amount to 28% of the company's finan-
cing requirements (44 % if connection fees are considered as internal cash
generation), which include substantial working-capital increases to pay off
remaining short-term debt and provide some cushion for higher-than-expected
requirements. Borrowings from the Bank and Peru's Corporacion Financiera de
Desarrollo (COFIDE) would provide 3C%, and contributions from the government
and developers (see attachment 7 to annex 13), 26%. To assure that earnings
above the legal dividend requirement are reinvested in utility assets, the
proposed oroject agreement limits Electrolima's dividends to o.5% p.a. of the
value of shares entitled to dividends. Electrolima's funds forecast is sum-
marized below and detailed in attachment 3 to annex 13:

Note:  The total project amount of S,/6,,131 'i$36.24)million reflects Electro-
lima's policy of capitalizing IDC for the construction period of each
project component and is therefore higher than the project cost of
S/6,087 million shown in paragraph 3 D6, but lower than Electrolima's
financing requirements.
6."5      The proposed US$36 million Bank loan would be made to the Republic of
Peru for a term of 20 years including three years of grace at the current Bank
interest rate, assumed to be 8.5% p.a. The government would relend UE$33.9
million of the loan to Electrolima on the same terms. As noted in paragraph
3.06, US$2.1 million of the loan woul(d be for technical assistance to the
government. This portion is not included in the above financing plan or in
the more detailed financial projections attached to annex 13.
6.06      COFIDE has approved a S/40o million loan to Electrolima of which
S/lqO million was disbursed in 1975. COFIDE has also indicated its agreement,
in principle, to provide an additional S/850 million to Electrolima over the
period 1976-78.  Eletrolima would, nresumably, ma;e arrangements with uorIDE
to obtain bne S/ .60u million n,eded to iieet its fin.ncinb require:cents in 1979
and 1980. COFIDEts current terms are nine years including two years of grmce,
11% annual interest.

Security
6.07      In past lending operations Electrolima has issued bonds to the
Bank under an open-ended indenture written in 1957 between Electrolima and
Schr5der Trust Company; use of this indenture has been necessary to prevent
private bondholders from having a prior claim on Electrolima's assets.
Repetition of this requirement is not necessary because the proposed loan
would be made directly to the Republic of Peru.
Debt service coverage
6.o8      The Bank has previously relied on financial tests included in the
1957 indenture which provide that:
a.   Electrolimals net income before interest and taxes should equal
at least 150% of its interest on funded indebtedness; and
b.   Electrolima's net tangible assets should be at least 150% of its
total funded indebtedness.
These tests did not prevent Electrolima from amassing very large amounts (over
US$20 million) of short- and medium-term debt in 1968-73, which were re-
financed only with governmental assistance in 1974, and a portion of which
(S/535 million in overdrafts at year-end 1975) remains to be liquidated. To
give the Bank an opportunity for closer review of Electrolimals financial situa-
tion, the proposed project agreement provides th-t Electrolima will not incur
long-term debt without the Bank's approval unless its most recent 12-month
internal cash generation is at least 1.5 times its maximum debt service re-
quirement (including the debt service on the proposed loan as well as exist-
ing ones) for any succeeding fiscal year. Because Electrolimals debt service
is expected to be high throughout the project period, Bank approval of future
borrowing is expected to be necessary. To prevent Electrolima from undue re-
liance on short-term debt, the proposed project agreement also provides tPat
Electrolima's maximum short-term indebtedness at any date is to be limited to
one-sixth of its operating, maintenance and administrative expenses (exclusive
of depreciation and other non-cash provisions) during the preceding twelve-
month period.

7. Agreements Reached and Recommendations
7.01      In the proposed loan agreement, the government would agree to:
a.   execution by acceptable consultants of the studies comprising
the technical assistance component of the project (paragreph 2.06).
7.02      In the proposed project agreement Electrolima would agree to the
following matters:
a.   use of consultants for the project (paragraph 3.09);
b.   submission of audited financial statements (paragraph 5.07);
c.   maintenance of tariff levels so as to provide sufficient fuids
for an adequate contribution-to-expansion (paragraph 6.02);
d.   dividend limitations (paragraph 6.04); and
e.   limitations on Electrolimals long-term and short-term inidebtedness
(paragraph 6.08).
7.03      Prior to declaring the loan effective, the Bank should receive
notification that the subsidiary loan agreement between Electrolirma and the
government has been signed.
7.04      The project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$36
million for a term of 20 years with a three-year grace period.

APPRAISAL OF FIFTH POWER PROJECT - PERU
Organization of the Electric Power Sector
1972 restructuring
1.        Prior to 1972, the public-service portion of the sector was composed
of distinct private, municipal and state entities serving concession zones or
regions; no national sector planning or coordination existed. Captive plants
serving large mining and industrial installations, which account for about 4C0
of total electricity generation, were generally not interconnected with public
service systems. Decree law no. 19521, the Normative Electricity Law of Sept-
ember 1972, made the State the primary factor in the sector by reserving for
it the responsibility for public-service electricity supply, creating a cen-
tral State-owned enterprise (Electroperu); providing for State participation in
existing private utilities (by far the largest of which is Electrolima); and pro-
viding for interconnection of power systems (see paragraph 5).
2.        The normative law gave Electroperu primary responsibility for plan-
ning, studying, engineering, construction, construction supervision, and
operation of all new generating facilities larger than 10 MW and for the trans-
mission/distribution functions of State electric utilities. To accomplish the
necessary sector and project feasibility studies, engineering, and construc-
tion supervision, the law created the Instituto de Investigaciones Energeticas
y Servicios de Ingenieria Electrica (INIE), which was to report directly to
Electroperu's executive president and thus be independent of Electroperu's
operating division. As detailed in paragraphs 6 and 9 it consolidated all
then-independent State-owned electricity agencies into Electroperu and pro-
vided for incorporation of municipally-owned utilities within two years and
for Electroperu to represent the State in the management of other electric
utilities.
3.        State participation in the other utilities was accomplished by means
of capitalizing public-domain assets. Prior to 1972 those assets, which are
primary and secondary distribution facilities paid for by third parties (prin-
cipally by the developers of new communities, existing customers through tariffs
and new customers who would recieve the service) and located in public streets
(in Electrolimals case, outside its original concession zone) but maintained by the
utilities were not classified as assets of the utilities. The normative law
declared the State to be the owner of the public-domain assets and provided
that the State contribute such assets to the appropriate utility, receiving
therefor shares equivalent to their value; such shares are not entitled to
dividends.
4.        Increased State participation in the private utilities is assured
by other sections of the law which provide that the State is to be the ex-
clusive buyer of all new shares issued by utilities and of all shares cur-
rently held by non-Peruvians.



Annex 2
Page 2 of 4 pages
5.        Other sections of the normative law oblige non-State utilities and
captive plants to intercoimect their systems with Electroperu's when the State
enterprise deems such interconnection necessary. The law's provisions were
extended in the M4arch 1974 Electrical Interconnection Law no. 20560, which
gives Electroperu responsibility for load dispatching and the Direccion General
de Electricidad (DGE) responsibility for establishing interconnection tariffs.
Present situation
6.        The State-owned electric utilities which were combined to form
Electroperu were:
a.   Corporacion de Energia Electrica del Mantaro, whose principal
facilities are a 342 MW hydro station, with an ultimate capacity
of 798 MW and transmission facilities to supply electricity from
Mantaro to Lima, Ica and Independencia (see map 11797);
b.   Corporacion Peruana del Santa, which operated the 100 MW Canon del
Pato hydro plant and 82 MW of gas turbines to serve the Chimbote-
Trujillo region;
c.   installations run by agencies reporting to the Sistema Nacional
de Apoyo a la Movilizacion Social, which include several hydraulic
and thermal generating plants, generally less than 50 MW each,
in various regions; and
d.   Servicios Electricos Nacionales, which operated about 250 small
isolated thermal installations.
7.        Electroperu has divided the country into the following five opera-
ting regions (with principal cities in each region):
North-central interconnected    - Lima, Chimbote, Trujillo
North                            - Bayovar, Piura, Talara
South-west                       - Tacna, Arequipa, Puno
South-east                       -  Cuzco
East                             -  Iquitos, Pucallpa
The north-central region is by far the largest electricity market with
electricity generation amounting to 87% of the country's total.
8.        Electroperu's operating results leave room for improvement.  Its
1973 operating losses exceeded SI 300 million (tariff increases and increased
energy sales from its largest installation - the Mantaro hydroelectric develop-
ment - are expected to improve these results). Its control over operations,
particularly over the 250 isolated plants for which it is responsible, is
limited. Completion of a major 220 kV transmission line to link the Chimbote-
Trujillo region with the central region (see map 11797) will be seriously de-
layed because of difficulties in arranging financing to pay for expected cost
overruns.



Annex 2
Page 3 of 4 pages
9.        Electroperu's participation in the management of other utilities
is not being carried out as provided in the normative law. No representative
of Electroperu sits on Electrolima's board of directors or otherwisewparticipates
in the company's management.
10.       INIE has been separated from Electroperu, presumably to report to
MEM. Its basic laws remain unwritten, however, and the failure of the draft
general law to recognize its existence (see paragraph 17) leaves its future
status in doubt.
11.       With respect to Electrolima, the go7rernment has concluded negotiations -
acquire the 21% interest in the company held by foreign shareholders.  The govern-
ment has proposed the terms of acquisition for the 25% of Electrolimats shares
currently in private Peruvian hands; the governmentts proposal was approved at
a shareholders' meeting in October. The shareholders will receive bonds in ex-
change for their shares;  terms of the bonds are detailed in attachment 7 to
Annex 12. Once this process is completed, state agencies, principally Electro-
peru, will be the exclusive owners of Electrolima's shares.
Present organizational problems
12.       Despite the provisions of the normative law which gave Electroperu
overall sector responsibility (paragraph 3), DGE has assumed responsibility
for sector planning and selection of future generating and transmission works,
citing its own organic law as authority for doing so. This arrangement, which
leaves to Electroperu only the execution and operation of the selected works,
is very unusual. In most electric power systems, the agency responsible for
planning, designing and executing works to meet expected growth in demand is
the operating agency, subject to governmental review only for policy and/or
budgetary purposes. The reasons for this are threefold: the operating agency
has more direct contact with the market for electricity - distribution com-
panies and/or retail consumers - and hence is in a better position to fore-
cast future requirements and coordinate its installation program with present
or prospective customers' needs; it has a more thorough knowledge of field
and operating conditions, which allows it to take into consideratiorn the capa-
bilities and limitations of its system to handle the expected loads; and it
is in a better position to accept all the responsibilities connected with plan-
ning decisions related to quality of service, such as amount of reserve, out-
age expectancy, etc.
13.       The results of the unique arrangement found in Peru are not en-
couraging. Both DGE and Electroperu have prepared their own market forecasts
and formulated a list of projects to meet the expected demand. The validity
of their demand forecasts, however, is questionable because the forecasts are
based on assumptions of industrial expansion which may not reflect the current
situation. There is no adequate hydro survey of the country; instead, indi-
vidual surveys of Peru's major river basins have been prepared by various
foreign consultants and local agencies. While pre-feasibility and feasibility
studies of certain hydroelectric developments (e.g., the Restitucion plant
downstream from the Mantaro plant, the Sheque plant upstream from Electrolima's
existing H-uinco plant and the Chorro plant upstream from Electroperu's existing



Annex 2
Pag    of 4 pages
Canon del Pato plant) exist, they may not be comparable because non-coincident
and uncoordinated study preparation may have resulted in the use of incom-
patible assumptions.
14.       To improve this situation, the proposed loan includes US$2 million
to assist the government in improving coordination among its power sector
agencies, establish a "master plan" of future generating and transmission
works, identify the training needs of sector personnel (including but not
limited to Electroperu's) and propose means of meeting those needs. The
master plan would include reliable projections of energy requirements for the
period 1977-96, a nationwide hydro survey, pre-feasibility-level cost estimates
for the most promising hydroelectric sites identified in the survey., and the
resultant least-cost scheme to meet the forecasted requirements. The Government
has agreed to the proposed terms of reference for this study (see the attachment
to annex 6).
Future developments
1.       Most foreseeable future developments concerning the power sector's
organization are embodied in the draft general electricity law which MEM
published in late 1974. The noteworthy features of the draft are that it:
a.   confirms the division of responsibility for sector planning,
selection, execution and operation of works advocated by DGE
(paragraph 12);
b.   provides for incorporation of all utilities into Electroperu at
an unspecified future (iate;
c.   fails to mention INIE;
d.   provides for a unified national tariff (see annex 3);
e.   establishes two funds, the electric development fund (fondo de
desarrollo electrico) and the network improvement fund (fondo de
ampliaciones de redes) to provide for financing of system expansion.
The former is to be funded by a portion of the rate of return to be
determined by DGE and the latter, by contributions from developers
and consumers to pay for the distribution works now known as public-
domain assets (paragraph 3); and
f.   creates a workers' community (comunidad de electricidad) to
participate in the management of electric utilities and in their
earnings and financing through a complex financing scheme detailed
in annex 12.

APPRAISAL OF FIFTH POWER PROJECT - PERU
Electricity Regulation and Tariffs in Peru
Regulation
1.        Electricity tariffs in Peru are regulated by the Direccion General
de Electricidad (DGE), which has already begun to take steps to implement the
features included in the draft general electricity law (annex 2). Among the
more noteworthy features are:
a.   the creation of a tariff system which provides for the eventual
implementation of a unified national tariff (under which standard
service classifications, demand charges and block energy rates
would be established for nationwide application regardless of
location or sources of electricity);
b.   bi-annual review of tariff levels; and
c.   determination of the allowable rate of return every four years.
2.        Implementation of the unified national tariff would be gradual.  As
an interim step the draft general law provides for the implementation of
regional tariff systems. The draft law also establishes a compensation fund
(fondo de compensacion tarifario) into which utilities whose revenues exceed
revenue requirements would contribute and from which those wihose requirements
exceed revenues would draw. DGE personnel have already drafted proposals re-
lating the tariff levels to be charged various customer classifications to
the overall average tariff levels. These relationships would be similar to
those inherent in Electrolimats tariffs (see paras. 8-10) and would be determined
more by political than by technical or economic factors. Under this system,
commercial and general-use tariffs are extremely high; governmental-use (ex-
clusive of water pumping, which is off-peak), about average; and residential
and industrial, quite low,
3.        While the draft law provides for tariff-level reviews every two
years, the underlying philosophy apparently does not prevent more frequent
tariff adjustments to compensate for inflation rates higher than expected
in the original biennial determination. Electrolimals 1975 tariff increases provide
evidence of this pragmatic approach: after having received an overall 30%
tariff increase in February 1975, a further increase of about 7% was put
into effect in July.
4.        Under the draft law the utility's revenue requirements are to be
its cost of doing business (broadly defined as purchases of goods and ser-
vices and personnel costs - presumably related to operations and maintenance -
taxes and provisions for depreciation using average useful lives determined by
DGE) plus an appropriate rate of return to be determined every four years by
MEM. This rate of return is designed to cover, in order of priority:



Annex 3
Page 2 of 3 pages
a.   the utility's financial charges;
b.   70% of its contribution to the workerst community (paragraph l5f
of annex 2); and
c.   a contribution to the electric development fund (paragraph l5e
of annex 2) to be determined by DGE.
Any excess profits (excedente economico) after deducting these charges would
be applied to the remaining 30% contribution to the workers' community and
other uses to be determined.
5.        As an interim measure (presumably until their consolidation into
Electroperu), the draft law would allow private or mixed utilities to include
an 8.5% return on shares entitled to dividends in their rate of return.
6.        The draft law's lack of specificity (e.g. with regard to the manner
in which contributions to the development fund are determined, what constitute
"financial charges" and whether tariff adjustments will be awarded more fre-
quently than bi-annually in case of high inflation) gives DGE a greater degree
of latitude in determining the self-financing capability of utilities than is
common in many other countries' regulatory laws or in Peru's existing Electric
Industry Law No. 12378 of 1955 (which, although nominally the regulatory law
until the general law has been made effective, has effectively been superseded
by the provisions of the draft general law). In 1975, when arrangements for
the government to acquire private shareholders' remaining interests are ex-
pected to be completed, regulatory attitudes towards the financing needs of
utilities in general and in particular have become more favorable than in
previous years, as indicated by the following:
a.   DGE officials have indicated their intention to allow Peruvian
utilities to self-finance 20-30% of their expansion programs; and
b.   Electrolima has received two tariff adjustments through July 1975, which
will enable it to achieve satisfactory financial performance for
the first time in four years (see chapter 6).
Because of the de facto suspension of existing regulatory legislation, the
lack of clear guidelines in the rnormative law and the lack of specificity in
the draft general law, a specific rate covenant similar to the draft general
law's interim allowable-earnings clauses (paragraphs 4 and 5) is proposed
for inclusion in the loan and guarantee agreements (see paragraph 6.02 of the
text).
7.        Even with government agreement to this covenant,  Electrolima's self-
finanicing capability would be closely monitored during project supervision,
for there is a risk that Electrolima will not be granted tariff increases
of sufficient size or with sufficient frequency to maintain its self-financing
capability in the face of continued high inflation rates (see paragraph 3.17
of the text).



Annex 3
Page 3 of 3 pages
Electrolima's tariffs
8.        Electrolima's present tariffs, which are summarized in the attachment,
contain both reasonable and questionable features. Among the reasonable
ones are:
a.   lower charges for off-peak consumption, both for water pumping
and for large industrial consumers, which have day-night metering;
b.   reactive energy charges for all but the smallest industrial custom-
ers; and
c.   some allowance (an 8% discount) for lower-income residential con-
sumers' (living in pueblos jovenes) basic consumption.
Other features deserve further investigation. _ Among the more notable are:
differing demand charges among various sizes of industrial customers; the
lack of a significant spread (or, in the case of nighttime large industrial
consumption, the existence of a negative spread) between Electrolimals industrial
tariffs and its incremental costs (Electroperu's tariffs); the very large
differential between industrial/residential tariffs and commercial/general,
which may indicate that the latter are subsidizing the former; and relatively
high connection fees, which, while offsetting to some degree the financial
effects of low residential tariffs, may inhibit lower-income residents' access
to public-service electricity supply.
9.        As far as can be determined, the differentiation among tariffs of
various customer classes reflects the government's desire for popular support
and to stimulate industrial development rather than any assessment of the cost
of providing service. The proposed loan includes funds for studies to determine
the incremental cost of providing electricity to the various customer classes
in the metropolitan Lima area, to assess the effect on the economy of Electrolimats
existing tariff structure (assuming that it does not reflect marginal costs)
and to propose an alternative structure which reflects marginal costs.
10.       Prompt completion of such a study is feasible because Electrolima has
adequate market statistics for its service area ( which may not be available for the
rest of the country) and particularly necessary because the general scheme of
Electrolima's tariff structure exemplifies the approach which DGE intends to take in
establishing regional and ultimately, national tariff schedules.  By assessing
the effect of Electrolimats tariff structure on energy consumption and the econory
the study could serve as a basis for reviewing tariff policies for not only
Electrolimals service area but the rest of the country.

APPRAISAL OF FIFTH POWER PROJECT - PERU
Brief Description of Some Power Projects
being considered in Peru
1.  Restitucibn _ydroelectric Plant
(a)  Location:  Department of Huancavelica
(b)  Plrpose and description of the Project:  This project's on'Ly purpose
is to provide electricity. It is located in the Mantaro River,
do wnstream from the existing Mantaro hydro station.  It utilizes
the water from the tailrace of the existing station carrying it
through a 1.3 km free-flow tunnel to an underground power plant
located 239 m below the end of the tunnel. In order to use the
output of the station in the system, new 220 kV transmission lines
to Lima and Mantaro (about 300 kin) would be built.
(c)  Present status: INIE has completed the feasibility studies and with
the help of Electrowatt (Switzerland) is preparing bidding documents
which are expected to be ready by mid-1976. The first uinit in-
service date is expected tc; be 1.979.
(d)  Estimated cost: US$16O0 mil'ion.
2.  Sheque Hydroelectric Plant
(a)  Location: Department of Lima
(b)  Purpose and description of the Project: This is a multipurpose project
which involves the atilization of water resources of the Santa Eulalia
River's upper basin (80 krm northeast of Lima) and the diversion of
water from the Mantaro river (Atlantic basin) for power generation,
water supply and irrigation. It involves the following construction
works:
-  10 km of tunnels;
-  13 km of canals;
-3 low,rock-fill dams (total volume of I450,000 m3 of materia.);
-  enlargement of existina transandean tunnel (from 12 to 20 in /sec);
-  installation of a power station (600 ri);
-  step-up substation (68O VI-JA);
-  switching substation en2arvement (Callah-uanca);
-  4O km of double-circuit transmission lines (220 kV):
-  enlargement of the exi;t;in  Huinco station (75 MW);
-  two pumping stations (340 NW - .00 GI4h/annuir).



ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 2
The Project could be constructed in two stages, the second stage
consisting of the enlargement of the transandean tunnel pumping
stations and related works to transfer waters from the Atlantic
to the Pacific basins.
(c) Present status: The feasibility study for the power plants and
associ-ated works has been completed by Mbtor Columbus (Switzerland).
The feasibility study for the transandean transfer scheme is being
conducted by Binnie & Partners and is expected to be completed by
late 1975. The bidding documents for the Sheque Project, not
including the Trans-Andean diversion, have been contracted with
Motor-Coluntbus.
(d) Estimated cost: US$300 million, which includes an estimated
US96L mMllion necessary for the diversion of water from the Atlantic
to the Pacific watershed which is an essential part of this
multipurpose project. The diversion cost may be as high as
US$110 million depending on which diversion scheme is adopted.
Part of the diversion cost -ould probably be allocated to other uses
of water.
3.  Chicama - Coal-Fired Station
(a) Location: Department of La Libertad
(b) Purpose and description of the Project: This project woald consist
of:
(i)  the exploitation of coal deposits, estimated at 270 million
metric tons of which about 60 million are considered to be
proven reserves. The coal has been estimated to have a heat
content of 6,570 kcal/kg; and
(ii)  the utilization of the coal for a 480 IW station (ultimate
capacity) for fifty years.
(c)  Present status:  PreLiminary studies, including the geological cnes
have been made by Kopex, a Polish consulting firm. The feasibility
of the Project is being studied by the same consulbants. It is
expected that these studies will be finished by mid-1977 and that
the first&unit may be operational by 1980.
(d)  Estimated cost:  US$116 million, which includes about USp30 million
for development of the coal mines; it does not include cost of
transmission lines.

Part B - Technical Assistance to the Government
I. Introduction
1.        The purpose of these studies is to assist the Peruvian government
to develop a comprehensive plan for the integrated development of the electric
power system in the Republic of Peru. The studies shall include a power market
survey, a hydropower assessment, a master plan, organization studies in the
sector and the development of a training prograa for sector personnel.
2.        To this end, the Consultants shall carefully review all available
information and previous power market and master plan studies in order to
assess their relevance to the requirements stated in the "scope of the studies".
After doing so, the Consultants will report on this phase of their work (see
para. 38.a) and propose an organization and schedule of work satisfactory to
the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the Bank and shall then revise, update,
expand and complement the studies as necessary in order to have, as an end
result, power market studies and master plan that meet the criteria set forth
in paragraphs 4-9 and 25-34 of these terms of reference.
3.        The Government, with technical assistance from
has commissioned                               to make an assessment of hydro
resources in the country. Those studies will be carried out according to the
attached terms of reference and are scheduled to begin by
proceed according to the attached schedule and finish by                     . The
Consultants will satisfy themselves of the relevance of the results of those
studies, as they become available, for the preparation of the master plan and
ieake the maximum possible use of the results of                    's work.
The Consultants will also complement                   's work or take it upon
themselves to make such additional or advanced work as may be necessary to have
a meaningful input to the master plan from hydropower assessment studies as
described in paragraphs 11-24 of these terms of reference. In making such
additional or advanced work, the Consultants agree to exchange information and
results with                    and to coordinate their efforts with them through
the Direccion General de Electricidad so as to avoid unnecessary duplication of
work.
II. Scope of the Studies
Power Market Survey
!.        A power market survey for all parts of the country leading to demand
projections from 1977 to 1996 is required. The purpose of this survey is to
provide a basis for economic evaluation of the various plans for supplying elec-
tric power for the future market. Therefore, it is important that long-range
trends be properly evaluated.
5.        All a-ailable historical data on Peruvian power sales to different
kind of electricity users shall be collected in order to determine:
(a) the classification of the load into customer categories and its
distribution by geographical areas,



ANNEX 6
Attachment
Page 2 of 7 pages
(b)  the effect of conditions of the copper and fishing industries on
past and present electric power usage, and
(c) the historical trends and growth rates by customer categories and
geographical areas.
6.        A similar collection of data concerning the macro-economic variables
such as population, gross national product, per capita income and agricultural,
industrial and commercial activities shall also be made. The relationship be
tween these variables and the use of power shall be studied to determine power
coefficients which shall be applied to projections of the macro-economic variables.
7.        Extensive interviews shall be conducted with the entities responsible
for medium and large agricultural estates, mines, manufacturing, industrial, and
large commercial operations to determine current demand and supply, service
reliability, short-term and long-term requirements for power.
8.        The effect on the power market of tariff structures and levels shall be
evaluated.
9.        The results of the market study shall be translated into annual and
seasonal load duration curves, and typical daily load curves.
10.       The consultants shall submit an interim report on the power market
study, within the first nine months following the Starting Date of the studies.
Hydropower Assessment
11.       An evaluation of possible hydro developments will be provided which
could meet or, in combination with thermal plants, help to meet the future
demand for power. An inventory of all undeveloped hydro sites of suitable size for
the principal isolated systems until such time as they are interconnected
(para. 28) will be required as well as identification and study or review exist-
ing studies of at least 20 of the most promising future developments of more
than 200 MW. The inventory shall also include possible extensions of plants
already existing or under construction.
12.       Some of the possible hydro developments have been evaluated in past
studies. The Consultants shall carefully review these studies and make use of
all the pertinent information for their assessment of hydropower potential in
Peru0
13.       All available hydrological informnation shall also be reviewed and
where necessary, extrapolation made of the precipitation measurements for areas
where direct flow measurements are missing. Correlations of run-off with rain-
fall, where hydrological records exist for long periods of time, shall be used
for the preliminary estimation of the flow conditions on all rivers of major
importance.
1.       The Consultants, after carefully studying all available studies, hydro-
logical information, maps, topographic data, and aerial photographs, shall make
a reconnaissance of all major rivers where previous studies have not, been made in
order to define the reaches of these rivers with power potential. A barometric
survey of the pow;er reaches shall be made where required to enable river profiles
to be drawn and elevations fixed at potential dam sites.
15.       Once the flow and the topographic conditions are defined for each river,
the Consultants shall determine or confirm the gross power potential per river

length. The power potential of each river shall be determined for the average
multi-annual value river discharge, the average wet-seasoh, thOe average dry
season, and for the critical dry season.
16.       The Consultants shall identify and make t  preliminary list of all
the potential hydro power developme4ts as requested in para. 9R. In making this
inventory, the Consultants shall consider the possibility of collecting water
from neighboring rivers in order to concentrate the potential ata few points, by
means of tunnels, and the possibility of developing pumped storage power.
17.       The Consultants shall inspect at least 20 of the most promising develop-
ments of more than 200 MW identified from the preliminary inventory. Each site
shall be inspected by a team composed of one hydro-civil engineer, one geologist,
one surveyor and one hydrologist. The team shall evaluate the site and any
previous study done on it with special emphasis on storage possibilities, geologic
conditions, seismic occurence, topographic conditions, access difficulties, stream
gauge location, availability of construction materials, possibility for river
diversion during construction, accommodation of spillway capacity, etc.
18.       Following inspections of the sites selected as the most promising,
an intensive review of hvdrological conditions shall be made. The Consultants
shall determine or confirm for each dame site, the most probable long4range
average flow, the water available during the driest period of the daHy season,
the most suitable storage, the installed and firm capacities and the energy pro-
duction during the average hydraulic year, the driest year of record and the
wettest year of record.
19.       The Consultants shall proceed with the preliminary design and cost
estimates of the plants determined in para. 17 above and of the possible expansion
of existing plants. If the designs are already available, the consultants shall
critically review them. The design shall take into account all geological inform-
ation available, and shall focus on the structures which play an important role in
the final cost of the plant. The cost estimate shall be accurate within a range
of no more than 20%, and shall be based on a careful study of current construction
costs. It shall take into consideration, in addition to the structures and equip-
mont, the access roads necessary for construction and operation of the plant, the
transmission lines necessary to make the connection with the system grid, the
operator's camp, the detailed engineering and design, and the construction super-
vision.
20.       Once the preliminary designs and cost estimates are completed for each
site, the Consultants shall classify these sites in two different ways, in order
of cost per kW of firm capacity, and cost per kWh of energy for the average year
respectively.
21.       Each site shall also be compared with an upper limit of cost based on
the estimated cost of thermal power and/or energy, with an appropriate adjustment
for transmission costs.  Any site which fails to meet this cost limitation shall
be dropped from further consideration, and an inventory of the remaining sites
shall be made.
22.       For the sites deserving inclusion in the inventory, additional topo-
graphic, hydrological and geological data shall be gathered by means of additional
ground surveys., geological surveys, seismic prospecting, test pits, drillings,
etc., to the extent considered necessary and practicable within the required
schedule and budget for completing the assessment.

23.       Following these new investigations, the Consultants shall review, in
order to improve their quality, the preliminary designs, power characteristics
and cost estimates of the 20 most promising hydro developments selected. The
ecological effects and non-power benefits or costs of each hydro development
shall be determined. The cost estimates shall include the investment which may
be necessary to take care of major ecological problems.
24.       The Consultants shall make recommendations for any additional stream
gauging, rainfall measurements, geological investigations, mapping, topographical
surveys, silt measurements, etc. required for the most promising sites. The
Consultants shall also make recommendations concerning any further studies neces-
sary for a more exact estimate of the technical and economic parameters of the
most promising sites.
Master Plan
25.       Taking into consideration the economic conditions in Peru, the Con-
sultants shall recommend a range of opportunity costs of capital to be used for
economic comparisons. For every development program of the power system envisaged
thereafter, the present worth of the stream of costs for four different discount
rates shall lie computed pointing out the present worth corresponding to the oppor-
tunity cost of capital in Peru.
26.       The Consultants shall study the existing system conditions.  They shall
describe how the demand is being met, the present sources of energy and their
relative economy, and the means available for transmission. They shall discuss
present operating practices and costs, system reliability, peculiar local
conditions, They shall make an inventory of all the existing power facilities
indicating their age, location, type, ownership, heat rate, water requirements,
operating costs, maintenance costs, etc. For the major generating plants already
existing or now under construction, the Consultants shall study Sheir capabilities
for expansion.
27.       Possible locations for at least 5 future oil-or gas-fired thermal power
stations should be identified. The Consultants shall give all the necessary justi-
fication in regard to the selected locations and for which they shall consider:
proximity to load centers, availability of water, fuel supply and storage, found-
ation conditions, access of transmission lines, and ecological effects.
28.       The Consultants shall assess the possibilities of installing a coal-
fired thermal station at Chicama, taking into consideration the elements mentioned
in para. 27 above.
29.       The Master Plan shall define which, if any, of the systems not currently
interconnected to the north-central interconnected system should be interconnected
and in what year such interconnection is economically advisable.
30.       The Consultants shall propose several logical sequences of development
of thermal generating plants or review and endorse previously developed sequences;
each sequence meeting the prospective demand for power and energy up to 1996.
These sequences, which may include gas turbines, shall all provide the power
system with the same degree of reliability.  The optimum size of the thermal
generating units to be installed, and the most economic sequence of all-thermal
development of generating resources, shall be determined on the basis of technical
judgment and least present worth cost.
31.       Based on the results of the power market survey, the Master Plan shall
determine the best location of bulk stepdown substations, and develop several

transmission systems to tie the thermal generating plants defined in para.27 to
load areas.  in conducting the transmission system survey, the Consultants shall
consider all relevant factors such as: proximity of power load to power sources,
terrain, vegetation, type of construction required, foundations, comperative lengths
of alternate routes, rights-of-way, accessibility for construction and maintenance,
meteorological data, costs, etc.
32.       The Consultants shall determine the most economic combination of thermal
generation and transmission system, to meet the demand for power and energy up to
1996.  This all-thermal development plan is called the reference program, and all
possible hydroelectric developments shall be compared with it.
33.       A final test of the economic bene2its of the most promising hydroelectric
developments selected by the hydropower survey (paras. 11-24), shall be made by
inserting them one after the other into the reference program, and computing the
corresponding present worth costs. Thus several new logical se-luences of develop-
ment of generation-transmission systems can be defined. The costs and benefits of
each sequence shall be compared to the costs and benefits of the reference program
on the basis of least present worth. The most economic sequence shall be the
Master Plan for expansion and integration of the electric generation and trans-
mission system of Peru for the years 1977 through 1996.
34.       Within the first twelve months following the Starting Date, the Con-
sultants shall submit an interim report on the Master Plan.
Organization Studies in the Power Sector
35.       The Consultants shall review the operating, planning and financial or-
ganization and capabilities of Electroperut and shall also review the interrelation-
ships between this entity and the Instituto de Investigaciones Energeticas y
Servicios de Ingenieria Electrica (INIE) and the Direccion General de Electricidad
for the purpose of optimizing the planning, designing, executing and operating
electric power projects facilities in Peru.
36.       In carrying out the obligations referred to above, the Consultants shall:
a. review the present responsibilities of Electroperu and those of INIE
and the Direccion General de Electricidad inasmuch as they affect
their relationship with Electroperu.
b. make recommendations for implementing satisfactory means f-or developing
the power sector and for carrying out and implementing all sector activities
and programs, taking into account the interrelation between development
of energy and water, land and other resources; and
c.   develop recommendations relative to planning and financial objectives
for the operating agencies including Electroperu.
Training Program
37.       The Consultants shall recommend to the Government a training program
that will enable the staff of the entities of the sector to implement the recom-
mended Master Plan and carry out their responsibilities optimally.

APPRAISAL OF FIFTH FOUSR PROJECT - PEWo
Rate of Return
1.        The following basic assumptions were made to calculate the rate
of return on the investment in the ProGect:
(a) that for these purposes, the cost of the Project does not include
taxes and import duties, estimated at lO  of the total costs;
(b) that it was not necessary to use an efficiency price for labor or
shadow price foreign exchange because their market value is not
significantly different from their economic value;
(c) that all the energy sold in 1976 through 1979 over and above the
1975 levels was due to the Project. This assumption is valid even
if the existing transmission and distribution systemn is not unduly
overloaded because it does not have excess capacitv either. The
existing system can only sell more energy than the 1975 total if a
reduction in system reserve during peak hours and  a   decrease
in system flexibility and an increase in compensating lower operating
temperatures on off-peak hours is accepted. This acceptance would
be equivalent to a xreducticn in the quality of service;
(d) that once the 1979 level of sales was reached, all incremental
energy sales would be due to future projects. This assumption is
valid for the distribution system for the reasons given in cb)
above. It is conservative and penalizes the transmission lines
and some transformers which may not reach their capacity for 4 or 5
years beyond 1979;
(e)  that all new customers connected between 1976 and 1979 would be
connected because of the Pro-ect and that all new customers after
1979 would be connected because of future projects. This
assumption follows from (b) and (c) above;
(f) that the tariffs and the non-returnable, non-interest-bearing
connection fees for new customers were an adequate measure of the
economic benefits of the Project. This assumption understates the
benefits of the Project as it does not take into consideration
electricity's contribution te industrial output, domestic convenience,
cost saving: over non-electric alternatives. The present average
tariff, S/. 1.31 (US$C.029) per k-Jh was used as a starting point for
the calculations;
(g) that the total real increase in Electrolima's operation and maintenance
costs from 1976 to 1979 would be associated with the Project and that
after 1979, all real increases in costs would be due to future
projects; and
Qi) that Electrolima would pruchase all of its incremental energy needs from
Electroperi. This assumption is consistent with the present
policies and laws of Peru. However, the pricing of this energy
i, somewhat difficult as not much is known regarding Electroperu's
pricing policy or of its future generating costs and it is considered
that the present price is higher than warranted by the investment and

operation and maintenance costs of Mantaro, the only Electroperu
plant connected to EEA's system. The present average purchase
price S/. 0.78 (US$0La7) per k',h was used as a starting point
for the calculations.
2.        The above assumptions result in the following cost/benefit streams
(in million S/.)for the basic case:
Costs                                  Benefits

5           _              757              489             1339                ho

3.        On the basis of the above assumptions, the rate of return of the
Project is -3.4 %.  On the basis of the recommended tariff -S/. 1.50 (US$0.033)
per kti-, the rate of return is 8.35%.
14.       As shown in page3 3-5 of this  annex, the rate of return is
highly sensitive to changes in the tariffs and slightly less so to changes in
the cost of power purchased from Electroperu while it is much less sensitive
to changes in the cost of the Project.

pages 3-5.

APPRAISAL OF FIFTH POWER PROJECT - PERU
Financial History and Projections
Summary
1.        After three years of unsatisfactory financial performance caused
in large part by inadequate tariff increases (paragraphs 3-5), Electrolima's
financial situation has improved in 1975 by virtue of two adjustments which
increased iGs tariff levels about 3b% above those prevailing at the oeginnmny
of the year (paragrapn 6).  Further tariff increases will be necessary durini  the
project period if the company is to finance a reasonable portion of its investment
program as provided for in proposed loan agreement (paragraph 6.02 of the
text.            Its internal financing capacity is expecte  to improve during
the project period because of higher non-cash provisions currently classified
as expenses (paragraph 9) and through payments to the workers' community to
be invested in its own bonds (paragraph 10).
2.        Attached to this annex are the following financial statements and
forecasts for 1972-80:
attachment 1   -  key financial ratios
attachment 2   -  income statements
attachment 3   -  estimated sources and applications of funds 1975-80
attachment h   -  estimated debt service 1975-80
attachment 5   -  debt outstanding at December 31, 1975
attachment 6   -  balance sheets
attachment 7   -  assumptions used in projections
Earnings history and financial position
3.        Principally because of the lack of adequate tariff increases,Electrolimats
earnings declined seriously in 1972-74. Although the company should have
received a tariff increase in early 1971 (according to the triennial schedule
provided by the 1955 regulatory law), the increase was not forthcoming until
1972, and its size (14%) was not sufficient to offset adverse events in 1973,
the most significant of which were worldwide currency fluctuations and interest-
rate increases (both'of which increased Electrolimats interest expelnse), new taxes
enacted by the government and accelerated inflation. Electrolima showed profits equal
to its legal dividends (8% and 8.5% respectively on preference and ordinary
shares) in 1972 only by reducing its depreciation provision from 3% to 2.26%
(in accordance with regulatory directives) and then deferring two-thirds of
the reduced provision to the two subsequent years. In 1973 its profits were
sufficient only to pay legal dividends on its preference shares and a cash
dividend of 1% on its ordinary stock. In 1974 it registered a net loss and
paid no dividends.

4.        Electrolima's net internal cash generation was negative in 1972-
1974. It met its financing requirements by a 1972 equity contribution and 1973
short-term loan from the government's development corporation, Corporacion
Financiera de Desarrollo (COFIDE), and from further short-term commercial
borrowings, which totalled over S/. 900 million by the end of 1973. COFIDE
guaranteed an external 10-year loan and lengthened the maturity of its own
loans in 1974, which reduced the severity of the companyts immediate cash re-
quirements. At COFIDE's insistence, the government agreed to make equity con-
tributions to Electrolima via Electroperu equal to the amortization of the
external loan and its own loans; such provisions would also apply to the 1975
COFIDF loan of S/. 100 million.
1975 and future tariff increases
5.        Electrolimals financial performance will improve significantly in
1975 by virtue of a 30% increase in its tariff levels put into effect in Feb-
ruary and a further 6.6% increase effective July 1. Those tariff increases
resulted in net internal cash generation (including connection fees) of about
S/. 473 million applicable to 1975 (net of S/. 168 million in dividends on 1975
earnings payable in 1976). As noted in paragraph 6.02 of the text, Electrolima
will require annual increases in its average tariff levels of 4% to 16% during
the project construction period to meet its covenanted contribution-to-expansion
ratio.
Projected financial situation
6.        Assuming that tariff increases are implemented as recommended in
paragraph 6.02 of the text so that Electrolima meets it contribution-to-ex-
pansion covenant, its financial situation will continue to improve. As
shown in attachment 1, its debt-service coverage will increase from 1.3 -
1.6 times in 1975-76 to 2.2 times in 1979, and its debt/equity ratio will
decrease from 53/47 at year-end 1974 to 30/70 at the end of 1979.
7.        The draft general electricity law provides for an additional inter-
nal financing method which has not been included in the projections because of
the uncertainty of its timing or auantitative effect. As discussed in para-
graph 4 of annex 3, the draft law provides for each utility to make an annual
contribution (participacion prevista) to the workers' community, initially to
be computed as five times the minimum monthly industrial wage in Lima for each
employee of the utility, and adjusted annually thereafter. Of this "partici-
pacion prevista", 70% (participacion basica) is to be part of the authorized
rate of return, and the remaining 30% (participacion complementaria), to come
from excess profits as defined in paragraph 4 of annex 3. Of the total annual
contribution (participacion efectiva), 40%O (participacion liquida) is to be
distributed to the employees in cash and the remaining 60% (participacion patri-
monial), invested in the t,tilityr's bonds to finance its construction program or,
in the unlikely event that the utility's program cannot absorb the investment,
invested in COFIDE obligations. The 40-60 split is to be applied to whatever
contribution the workers' community receives, whether or not it amounts to the
entire "participacion prevista".

Assumptions Used in Financial ProJections
Income statement: revenues
1.        Sales of electric energy have been assumed to increase at an aver-
age annual rate of 8.3% between 1975 and 1980 (paragraph 4.03 of the text).
For projections of revenues, the average tariff levels have been derived
from the total revenue requirements resulting from the contribution-to-ex-
pansion covenant (see paragraph 6.02 of the text) and the projected energy
sales.
Income statement: expenses
2.        In the feasibility study submitted to the Bank, Electrolima performed a
detailed analysis of the components of operating expenses consisting of
salaries (50%), employee benefits (20%), fuel and materials (7%), general
and administrative expenses (W%), taxes (7%) and other expenses (10%). The
increase in operating expenses so obtained for 1975 and 1976 was used in the
determination of the tariff increase put into effect on July 1, 1975. The
rates of increase of operating expense obtained (20% for 1975 and 16% for
1976) were very close to the projected cost-of-living increase in metropoli-
tan Lima, which is appropriate inasmuch as the bulk of the operating expenses
(70%) is for salaries and employee-related benefits. The projections for 1977
through 1980 have therefore been based approximately on estimated increases
in the cost of living (16, 16, 14 and 12% respectively for 1977-80).
3.       The cost of energy purchased from Hidrandina is determined in
accordance with the tariff schedule contained in Ministerial Resolution No.
1048-74-EM/DGE of September 30, 1974.  This calls for Electrolima to purchase a
minimum amount of energy from Hidrandina of 500 GWh at a cost of 51 101.9
million. The cost of additional purchases of energy thereafter is 1 centavos
per kWAh. The cost of energy purchased from Hidrandina also includes the
operating expenses of the two Hidrandina hydro generating stations. In 1975,
this cost amounted to SI 8.6 million with about 75% going for salaries and
the remainder being expenses for materials, transportation and miscellaneous
purchases. This portion of the cost is assumed to increase at the same rate
as the cost-of-living in Lima. Below is a summary of the estimated (1975)
projected (1976-80) costs of purchased energy from Hidrandina:

1979          600           116.9          14%           16.1              133.0
1980         600            116.9          12%           18.0              134.9
4.        Energy purchased from Electroperu is determined in accordance with
Ministerial Resolution No. 1385-EM/DGE of December 31, 1974 and amended on
July 1, 1975. The tariff structure for energy purchased from Electroperu is
a three-part tariff with separate charges for active and reactive energy as
well as a demand charge (see the attachment to annex 3). The average charge
per kkh was about 67 centavos before July 1, 1975.  The increase of July 1,
1975 amounts to an effective rate increase of 17% (or 11 centavos per kit).
An average rate of 78 centavos per kWi has therefore been assumed in the
forecast for the latter half of 1975 through June 1977. A 10% tariff in-
crease has been assumed in July 1977 and again in July 1979. The cost of
energy purchased from Electroperu for the forecast period is summarized below:

5.        For the years 1975 and 1976 depreciation was determined in accordance
with rates approved by DGE in the tariff study. The effective depreciation
rates for Company Plant were 2 .7% for 1975 and 1976. For public domain
installations they were 4.7% in 1975 and 4 .5% in 1976.  For the ren,ainder of
the forecast period, depreciation rates of 3.0% on Company assets and 5% on
public domain installations have been used.

6.        The contribution-to-expansion is a provision to be determined taking
into account the financing requirements of the ut;ility. The amounts included
in the forecasts are those set forth by Electrolima in its tariff applications
to DGE. These provisions would presumably be renamed contributions to the
electric development fund (paragraph h of annex 3) once the general law is put
into effect.
7.        Income taxes are computed at 20% of net income after payment of the
legal dividend (8.5% of capital entitled to dividends).
8.        Net operating income for 1975 was assumed to be the remainder of oper-
ating revenues less operating expenses. This resulted in a rate of return of
7.3% (8e4% if the contribution-to-expansion iLund is excluded from operating ex-
penses). Net operating income for 1976 and 1977 (and thereafter) have been
assumed to be the difference between operating revenues and operating expenses
that would result from the contribution-to-expansion covenant (see paragraph
6.02 of the text). The rates of return on average net fixed assets would range
between 7.0% and 8.9% over the 1976-1980 period (7.7% and 9.7% if the contri-
bution-to-expansion fund is excluded from operating expenses - see attachment 1
to this annex). Dividends have been computed at 8.5% of the portion of equity
capital representing the value of shares entitled to dividends (see paragraph 18)e
9.        The other components, i.e. those relating to the workerst community
participation and excess profits, of net operating income proposed in the draft
general law (paragraph 4 of annex 3) have not been considered in these projec-
tions because of the uncertainty regarding their timing and quantitative effect
on Electrolima's finances.  As detailed in paragraph 10 of this annex, the workers'
participation is designed to assist in providing financing for the uttilities, so
that omitting it tends to understate the utility's eventual self-financing
capability.
Sources and applications of funds
10.       The proposed IBRD loan amount includes only the portion to be onlent
by the government to Electrolima.
11.       Government contributions represent amortization of the First National
City Bank and COFIDE loans in 1974-75, which the government has agreed to
contribute to Electrolima via Electroperu. COFIDE may insist on similar pro-
visions concerning amortization of its future loans to Electrolima which would
increase the funds available to Electrolima from the values shown beginning in
late 1978 or 1979.
12.       Electrolima does not include developers' contributions and related con-
struction in its own funds forecasts because they do not involve funds (the
developers construct the facilities) and because, until 1973, the public-domain
assets were not caDitalized in the comDany's accounts. Now that such assets
are reflected in Electrolimals balance sheet, inclusion of the developer's
contributions (which comprise a significant proportion of public-domain assets)
in the funds statement appears appropriate.

Balance sheet: assets
13.       To reflect the effect of inflation on costs for electric-utility
plant, a revaluation of 40% effective at year-end 1975 has been put into
effect.  Subsequent revaluations of 10% each year thereafter are assumed.
i4.       The year-by-year changes in Electrolimats plant and depreciation
accounts, including the assumed revaluations, are shown below in millions of

15.       Under a June decree-law, Peruvian holders of about 24.5% of Electrolimats
shares with a nominal value of about S/ 1,280 million will be offered the
opportunity to sell their shares to Electroperu, receiving therefore Electrolima,
8.-5  15-year bonds with 5 years of grace;  it is expected that most such share-
holders will participate in this voluntary exchange. To complete the trans-
action, Electrolima will receive notes of like amount from -lectroperu, which are
shown as investments.  The cash effect on Electrolima during the grace period will
be zero; Electroperu will use the 8.5% dividends on its newly-acquired Electrolima
shares to pay the bond interest.  Electrolima would receive funds from Electro-
peru beginning in late 1980 to amortize the bonds, reducing the "investment"
correspondingly.
16.       No such provision is made for acquisition of Electrolima shares held by
foreigners; under an August 1975 decree-law, the government announced agree-
ment whereby Electroperu would acquire all such shares (as well as Hidrandina's)
in exchange for its own bonds. The terms of the bonds are:

17.       Receivables are estimated at two months' equivalent of annual sales,
reflecting Electrolima's collection history.
Balance Sheet: capital and liabilities
18.       Separate capital accounts are maintained for capital representing
company assets, which is entitled to dividends, and that representing public-
domain assets, which is not.
19.       The 1955 regulatory law provides that increments arising from plant
revaluations are to be applied to accumulated depreciation and to the reserve
for foreign exchange losses, with the balance accuring to the companyts capital.
Yearly increments to the accumulated depreciation account represent the results
of applying the revaluation rates to depreciation accumulated as of the beginning
of the year. The corresponding increment to the reserve for exchange losses re-
sult from applying the revaluation rates to foreign debt outstanding at the begin-
ning of the year.   The total revaluation, using assumptions shown in paragraph
13 would thus be distributed as follows (in millions of soles):

Because of inadequate revaluations from 1969 until 1975 and effective devaluation
of the US dollar (to which the Sol is pegged) with respect to currencies which
form a large portion of Electrolimals indebtedness (both IBRD loans and the
company's own bonds denominated in Swiss francs), the exchange-loss reserve is
now negative. Plant revaluations as assumed here would restore this reserve to
provide for possible future revaluations of other currencies vis-a-vis the sol.
The increments to the capital accounts are summarized below (in millions of soles):

20.       The Electric Industry laws provide for the establishnent  of a fund for
public domain installations to be used for construction of high and low tension
distribution networks outside the initial zone of Electrolima's concession area.
Contributions to the fund come from connection fees, developers contributions,
;the contribution to expansion fund and from depreciation of public domain assets.
Increments to the fund for public domain installations are derived as follows,
in millions of soles:

Until 1974 the fund has had a negative balance, which indicates that the com-
pany has been financing a portion of public-domain expansion with its own
funds.

excess of provisions (composed of surcharges on revenues and payrolls) over
drawings, as specified by applicable Peruvian laws.
