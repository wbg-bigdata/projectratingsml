INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF PERU FOR A
FIFTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Peru, for the equivalent of US$36.0 million to help finance
a fifth power project. 'rhe loan would have a term of 20 years, including
3 years of grace, with the interest at 8-1/2% per annum. US$33.9 million of
the proceeds of the loan would be relent to ELectrolima on the same terms.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitLed "Economic Position and Prospects of Peru" (No.655-PE)
was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 3, 1975. Country data sheets
are attached as Annex I.
3.        Since 1968 the Government has followed a development strategy in which
economic growth is linked to a transformation of the society to achieve broader
popular participation in the country's economic, social and political life, thus
addressing one of the most serious problems of Peru's economy and society --the
sharp differences in wealth and opportunities between income classes and
geographical regions. As was recognized by the Consultative Group for-Peru,
which met in Paris in Apr.il 1975, much progress has been made during recent
years in implementing this strategy.  The land reform in the coastal areas is
advanced and, although g:reater difficulty has been found in improving the lot of
the Sierra peasants, efforts to organize production cooperatives there are being
accelerated. In the fieLd of industry most enterprises have complied with the
Industrial Community legislation --which provides for a gradual participation of
the workers in the ownership of the enterprise-- and a new Social Property Law
was approved aimed at promoting new industrial and entrepreneurial capacity
within a system of self-maanagement by the employees. Some progress has also
been made in strengthening the management capability of the public sector and
the Government has been able to secure increasing amounts of foreign loans
to finance the public investment program, although much of this inflow was on
relatively hard terms.
4.        Following two years of financial consolidation in 1968-69, GDP grew
at an annual rate above '.5 percent during 1970-7h. Gross domestic investment
rose from less than 13% to almost 17% of GDP between 1970 and 1974, largely
because of the increase of public and private investment in mining and petroleum.
However, as consumption a,lso grew faster than GDP and heavy losses were incurred
by public enterprises marketing imported petroleum and foodstuffs, gross
national savings fell from 15 to 11% of GNP between 1970 and 1974. The excessive
growth of aggregate demanid combined with the sharp rise in Peru's import prices
since 1973 resulted in both an acceleration of the annual rate of domestic
inflation --fram an average annual rate of 7.2% during 1969-73 to over 171 in
1974-- and an increase in the deficit of the balance of payments on current
account from 0.5 to 6.2% of GDP between 1972 and 1974. Net long-term capital
inflows rose from $110 mLllion in 1972 to $840 million in 1974. This inflow
went to both public and private sectors, including substantial credits for

mineral resource development. This inflow permitted a $290 million increase
in net international reserves in spite of the widened resource gap.
5.        During 1975, the Government strove to reverse the deteriorating
financial trends through a series of tax and price measures. In January 1975
indirect taxes were increased and subsidies on food were reduced. On June 30
a second set of measures included: (a) increases in prices of basic foodstuffs,
petroleum (ranging from 25 percent for diesel fuel to 100 percent for premium
gasoline), and other basic goods such as steel and cement; (b) a 40% reduction
in prices of fertilizers; and (c) strict controls on salary adjustments in the
public and private sectors. Subsequently, on September 26 the Sol was devalued
by about 1l4.
6.        The measures taken in 1975 were directed at attacking some of the
basic causes of Peru's financial difficulties, excessive growth of aggregate
demand with resulting fall in national savings, stagnation of food output and
low drnamism of export volume. However, the country's financial position remained
under strong pressures as export earnings and the rate of growth of GDP fell
mainly because of the contraction in world demand for Peru's exports, adverse
weather conditions and labor strikes. The decline in export demand, tDgether
with work stoppages, resulted in a drop in mining output. Abnormal ecological
conditions limited the recovery of fishmeal output and contracted the catch of
food fish. Bad weather conditions, inadequate supply and high prices of
fertilizers and other production inputs, and inadequate price and marketing
policies followed in previous years affected agricultural output. In addition
to export related factors, other causes added to a widening of the external gap.
While gross domestic investment rose to 19% of GDP, the measures taken did not
suffice to stop the fall in savings and the resource gap widened to over 9% of
GDP. The fall in savings was principally caused by the large losses of state
enterprises marketing petroleum, foodstuffs and fertilizers. In addition, a
contraction in real terms of private sector financial savings occurred mainly
because of increasingly negative real interest rates and the intensification of
inflationary expectations. Import demand grew rapidly not only because of the
expansionary financing of public sector deficits but also because of the sharp
increase in food and petroleum imports and because the increase in investment
(mainly in petroleum and mining) had a high import content. Thus much of the
fiscal package's impact was eroded during the second half of 1975. Net long-term
capital inflows totalled an estimated $1.2 billion in 1975, but were not
sufficient to finance the current account deficit and net international reserves
fell from $690 million in December 1974 to around $150 million in December 1975,
equ.ivalent to only about 3.5 weeks of merchandise imports.
7.        In the next few years Peru's finances --external and domestic--
will be under considerable pressure. Much will depend on the speed at which
the economies of the industrialized countries recover with the resulting
increase in prices and values of Peru's exports, on the availability of long-
term foreign capital on softer terms than in 1975 and on the Government's ability



-3 -
to cash the growth of aggregate demand and increase savings. In 1976 the terms
of trade are not likely to improve, while the volume of exports will not expand
much because most of the large mining projects now under construction will not
be completed until 1977 or later. At the same time, if international capital
markets continue to be as tight as they are now Peru may have difficulty in
obtaining large net additional funds from commercial sources on suitable terms.
It, therefore, has been clear to the Government that most of the effort to
reduce the resource gap during 1976 will have to be made internally.    Accord-
ingly, on January 10 the Government approved another set of more stringent
austerity mneasures aimed at reducing the public sector deficit, discouraging
imports and stimulating agricultural production. The measures approved include:
(a) further increases in prices of petroleum products and basic foodstuffs;
(b) increases in taxes on income, property and consumption abroad; (c) inclu-
sion of agricultural cooperatives and public enterprises in the income tax
rolls; (d) a 5% cut in central government budgeted current expenditures; and
(e) licensing for all imports. These measures are expected to reduce the
public sector unfinancedl gap by the equivalent of about $330 million by sub-
stantially cutting the projected deficits of the public enterprises and
increasing tax revenues. The Government is also studying a revision of interest
rate policies and a change in incentives to industry aimed at reducing their
fiscal cost. Moreover, it has stated that it is prepared to take additional
measures later this yea.r should the financial position make this necessary.
8.        Starting in 1977 the balance of payments situation is likely to begin
to improve as the volume of mining exports will increase substantially. In
addition, it is likely that Peru will virtually eliminate its dependence on
imported petroleum by the end of 1977 and will thereby save some $350 million
per year by 1981 (at 1975 prices). However, it is now considered unlikely that
the country will become a substantial net exporter of petroleum in the foresee-
able future. The Government is also making efforts to develop other lines of
export, such as in manufactures and tourism.
9.        In the future Peru will have to rely more on medium and long-term
borrowing to finance its investment program, rather than on continuing large-
scale commercial borrow5.ng. The April 1975 5ons-ultative Group reviewed the list
of projects presented by the Peruvian Government and concluded that project loan
commitments of the order of $950 million annually would be required during
1975-76. The Consultati've Group recommended that external financing should be
provided on terms as favrorable as possible (including assistance on concessional
terms) and agreed that some local cost financing was needed. To ensure that the
burden of debt service does not become excessive in the late seventies and early
eighties, at least one half of new loan commitments should be obtained on terms
similar to those of official lending agencies. This is comparable with what
was achieved during 197i-74.



- 4 -
10.       While actual inflows of external loans during 1975 were similar to
what was expected by the Consultative Group, the average terms were much harder.
Only about one third of new commitments were obtained at terms comparable to
those of official lending agencies and the average maturity of commercial loans
was below five years. Together with the poorer prospects for petroleum produc-
tion this makes it even more critical for Peru to obtain longer maturities in
future borrowing. The public debt service ratio which was 22% in 1974 rose to
an estimated 27% in 1975 reflecting mainly a sharp increase in interest pay-
ments and the decline in the value of merchandise exports. Although the debt
service ratio will remain high for the rest of this decade, it should decline
gradually in the early 1980's if the Government is successful in increasing
national savings and stimulating non-traditional exports and if more suitable
lending terms are obtained in future years.
11.       In sum, during recent years the Government has continued to carry out
the economic and social reforms initiated in 1968 and simultaneously achieved
a satisfactory rat-e of economic growth. While the Government is committed to
consolidating these reforms so as to move toward a more just society, efforts
are also being made to mobilize natural and financial resources to achieve and
finance a satisfactory expansion of the economy and of per capita income. As
has been the case in most other Latin American countries, Peru has been
seriously affected by the international recession and is now experiencing
considerable financial difficulties. Since early 1975 it has taken measures
designed to help solve the present problems and it proposes to take further
action if this should become necessary. Moreover, the Government has also
shown its willingness to re-examine its industrial development policies, which
is a subject of particular importance for the sound long term growth and
diversification of the economy.
12.       Given Peru's export prospects and the present structure of its
external debt, the country will need a substantial amount of long-term financing
to meet its development requirements. We expect that the efforts to restore and
maintain internal and external financial stability will continue and that the
policies to develop natural resources, improve human resources and increase the
standards of living of the rural poor will continue to be pursued. Given such
policies, Peru continues to be creditworthy for external lending on conventional
terms.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PERU
13.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's 29th operation in Peru. With
the $76.5 million loan for a Lima-Amazon transport corridor project approved on
December 30, 1975, Bank lending to Peru has reached $394.7 million net of
cancellations. Of this amount, 56 percent has been for transportation (mainly
highways and ports), 21 percent for agriculture, 17 percent for electric power
and about 6 percent for education. In addition, a small loan was made for
industry. Bank lending to l'eru during FY68-73 was limited to a reconstruction
loan made in 1970, due to a combination of factors, mainly the Bank's concern
over the Peruvian fiscal situation and balance of payments prospects and the then
outstanding investment dispuites. As these problems were being solved the Bank
resumed lending to Peru in FY74 with three loans for a total amount of $75 mil-
lion. As lending was being resumed during that period, Bank project identifica-
tion and preparation activities proceeded and now Bank lending to the country
is being increased.
14.       On July 25, 1975, the Government nationalized the assets of the
Marcona Mining Company in Peru without making provision for the payment of
compensation. Subsequent negotiations between the Company and the Government
did not reach a conclusion and the matter was taken up for negotiation between
the United States and Peruv.ian governments. Certain interim understandings were
reached, and the discussionS are continuing. In these circumstances, it has
seemed to me appropriate to present this loan proposal to the Executive Directors.
I intend to review progress made on this matter prior to presentation to the Board
of other loans now at an advanced stage of consideration (see paragraph 20 below).
15.       IFC commitments to date have been about $24.0 million ($15 million to
Southern Peru Copper Corporation for the Cuajone Copper mining project and the
rest all in industry) of whi.ch $15.3 million is held by the Corporation. Project
execution has been generally satisfactory. Annex II contains a statement of
Bank loans and IFC investments as of December 31, 1975, and notes on the execu-
tion of ongoing projects.
16.       The Bank plans to assist the Government in achieving its economic and
social development goals by aiding in:  (a) the expansion of productive capacity
in crucial sectors; (b) the creation of a physical and social infrastructure
capable of sustaining and fostering the positive evolution of the nation's
productive capacity; and (c) the consolidation of structural and institutional
reform which will help the socioeconomic transformation now underway. Also the
Bank expects to continue to play a role in coordinating external assistance
through the mechanism of the Consultative Group, the next meeting of which is
scheduled to convene in late 1976 or early 1977, and will try to become a
catalyst for new sources of funds for major investment projects.



- 6 -
17.       The Bank's program in agriculture has a two-fold objective:  raising
the standard of living of the large rural population of the highlands and
increasing food production. Following up on the agricultural sector mission
which visited the country in 1974, Bank staff and the Bank/FAO Cooperative
Program are assisting the Government in the preparation of projects for rural
development in the Sierra and irrigation rehabilitation in the coastal area; a
first irrigation rehabilitation project is being appraised by the Bank. A
mining project has been appraised jointly with the IDB and negotiations for a
joint financing operation are now in progress.  This project of CENTROMIN-PERU,
which took over the Cerro de Pasco operations, is to expand copper production
and exports, to reduce the environmental effects of the mining operations, and
to improve the living conditions of the miners. Also, a DFC project and a sites
and services project to help alleviate poverty among the urban poor are currently
being appraised. In addition, the Bank has identified other projects in the
power and transport sectors. At present, Bank loans to Peru constitute about
5.8 percent of total outstanding debt, including undisbursed, and absorbed 4.8
percent of the country's external debt service obligations in 1974. No
significant changes in these ratios are expected for the next five years.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
Energy Resources
18.       Peru is well-endowed with energy resources. At present the main
source of energy is petroleum which accounted for 77% of all commercial sources
in 1972. About one third of the petroleum needs is currently imported but
recent discoveries in the Amazon basin indicate that by 1977 the country may be
self-sufficient. The second source of energy is hydroelectric resources which
provide 72% of all electric energy generation and about 18% of all energy
consumed in the country; vast hydroelectric resources are still unexploited.
Coal has been a relatively minor source of energy, but recent preliminary
investigations have revealed the existence of important exploitable coal
deposits in the north of the country, which would also allow for development
of this source of energy as a complement to the others. It is the stated
policy of the Government to substitute for petroleum products in the genera-
tion of electricity; under this policy, a number of hydro projects are now
under consideration for early implementation.
Sector Organization
19.       Up to 1972, the power sector consisted of a number of private municipal
and state-owned utilities, the largest of which by far was Empresas Electricas
Asociadas - recently renamed Electrolima, serving several concession zones and
regulated by State agencies; captive plants serving large mining and industrial
installations were not interconnected with public-service systems.



- 7 -
20.       The sector was reorganized by Decree Law of September 1972, known as
the Basic Electricity Lavr (Ley Normativa).  This law made the State the primary
factor in the sector by reserving for it the responsibility for public service
electricity supply, creating a central State-owned enterprise (Electroperu),
providing for State participation in existing private companies and providing
for interconnection of power systems.
21.       Electroperu was thus created by consolidating the then State-owned
utilities and it was made responsible for planning, studying, engineering,
construction, construction supervision and operation for all new generating
facilities larger than 10 MW and for the transmission and distribution functions
of the State electric utilities. State participation in the other utilities was
accomplished by means of capitalizing the public-domain assets (mainly primary
and secondary distribution facilities paid for by third parties - developers or
customers - and located in public streets) and declaring the State as their
owner, and by providing that the State is to be the only buyer of new shares
issued by utilities and all shares currently held by non-Peruvians. Intercon-
nection of private utilities and captive plants with Electroperu's system is
compulsory when Electroperu deems such interconnection necessary.
22.       The new organization and structure of the sector, as prescribed by the
Basic Electricity Law, follow rational principles and should provide a sound
basis for an orderly development of the sector in line with the general develop-
ment objectives of the country. In practice, however, a number of problems have
come to light which may be considered transitional consequences of the profound
institutional changes that are taking place, but that will have to be addressed
lest they jeopardize the sound development of the sector. In the first place,
despite the provisions of the Basic Electricity Law, the General Directorate for
Electricity in the Ministry of Energy and Mines, has "de facto" assumed respon-
sibility for sector planning and selection of future generating and transmission
works, citing its own organic law as authority for doing so. This arrangement,
in the absence of a properly defined coordination with the entity responsible
for the execution and operation of the selected works, is unsatisfactory in that
the company's direct contact with the market and knowledge of field and operating
conditions, which are basic inputs for sound planning, are mostly lost; the
results of this "de facto" organization have not been encouraging so far. Another
practical problem is that because of the fragmented origin of the sector,
Electroperu's control over operations, particularly over the 250 isolated plants
for which it is responsible, is limited; its participation in the managernent of
other utilities is only carried out in part; and its operating results in
general are poor.  The sectoral technical assistance component of the project,
as described below in paragraph 29, will help define and solve these problems.
Regulation and Tariffs
23.       Electric utilities in Peru are effectively regulated by the General
Directorate for mlectricity of the Ministry of Energy and Mines following sound
guidelines, which are consistent with the Basic Electricity Law and are expected
to be crystallized in a general electricity law. The underlying philosophy for



- 8 -
the establishment of tariffs is to provide public utilities with revenues
sufficient to cover their operating expenses and financial charges and to
generate a surplus which will allow the utilities to contribute significantly
to the financing of their own expansion programs.
Sector Development
24.       Peru has planned several mining and industrial projects with large
power and energy needs which will obviously create major demands on the power
sector. The orderly and efficient development of the sector to meet these
demands is intimately related to the sound sector planning mechanism to be
established, and to which the technical assistance component of the propcsed
project is directed. The master plan to be drawn on the basis of the existing
identified projects will provide a program to add about 2,300 MW in the northern
and central regions and about 700 MW in the rest of the country by 1984. The
Bank is planning to participate in the financing of such expansion of generating
capacity and concurrently to assist the sector in setting up adequate planning
for future expansion.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       The proposed project, which includes the estimated requirements for
the expansion of the transmission and distribution systems of Electrolima from
1975 to 1978, would be the fifth project of the company, and the sector, receiving
Bank financing. The Bank appraised a previous version of this company's expan-
sion program in early 1973, but further loan processing was delayed until 1975
to allow time to solve the then outstanding financial problems of Electrolima.
These included its need for higher tariffs and refinancing a large amount of
short term debt. After the Government took appropriate steps to resolve these
problems the proposed project was appraised in July 1975. Negotiations were
held in Washington, D. C. on January 26-30, 1976; Electrolima's delegation was
led by Mr. Ricardo Tirado, General Manager, and the Government was represented
by Messrs. Ulises Montoya and Luis Ampuero of the Ministries of Econonm and
Finance and Energy and Mines, respectively.   A Loan and Project Summary is
attached as Annex III. An appraisal report No. 904a-PE dated February 11, 1976,
on the project is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
Description
26.       The proposed project consists of two distinct components: the 1975-78
expansion program of Electrolima's transmission and distribution systems and
technical assistance to, and training for, the State entities in the power
sector. The component of the project related to Electrolima wauld include
transmission, subtransmission and distribution facilities, auxiliary services
and consultant services and training needed to carry out the expansion program.
The technical assistance component for the power sector consists of: 1) con-
sulting services to assist the Government in improving coordination among its
power agencies, establish a "master plan" of future generating and transmission



works and identify the training needs of sector personnel; 2) a training
program for sector personnel in operation, planning and administration of' large
public utilities enterprises; and 3) a tariff study. A more detailed descrip-
tion of the project ccmponents may be found in Annex III.
27.       Electrolima will carry out the expansion program and the Ministry of
Energy and Mines will be responsible for the administration of the sectoral
technical assistance component of the project, employing consultants as required
under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank; the part of the loan allocated
to Electrolima's expansion program will be relent by the Republic of Peru to
Electrolima on the same terms as the Bank loan to the Republic of Peru, under
contractual arrangements to be approved by the Bank; Electrolima will bear the
exchange risk of the part of the loan relent to it. Electrolima, with the
limited technical assistance in specific areas provided for in the project, will
have the administrative and technical capacity to carry out the project. The
company's performance in project execution under previous loans has been
satisfactory. It is now expected that the proposed project will be completed
by mid-1979.
Electrolima
28.       Electrolima is the public-service concessionaire for the Metropolitan
Lima Area. Formerly, under other names (i.e. Empresas Electricas Asociadas and
Lima Light & Power) Electrolima was a privately-owned, Swiss controlled company.
In 1973, the Government established control over it by assuming ownership, in
the name of Electroperu, of the public domain assets managed by the company and
in August 1975 it reached agreement with the foreign holders of Electrolima's
shares to acquire their share capital participation; in mid-1975, a voluntary
exchange of shares held by Peruvians for the company's bonds has been offered
and it is expected that GDvernment ownership of the company will soon become
close to 100%.
29.       Electrolima is a well organized, well managed utility with technical
competence to execute the project and operate the system. The natural transi-
tional problems associated with the change in ownership have not interfered
significantly with managenent's administration of day-to-day operations. Most
of top management positions, previously held by Europeans are now filled by
Peruvians. The company's policy of promotion from within, the depth of its
middle management and supervisory personnel, and its training program have
served to provide sufficient management continuity.
30.       Electrolima's financial performance up to 1972 was generally satisfac-
tcry, but mainly because of the lack of adequate tariff increases, Electrolima's
earnings declined seriously in 1972-74. In 1972, Electrolima showed profits
equal to its legal dividends (8 percent and 8.5 percent on the par value of
preference and ordinary shares, respectively) by reducing its depreciation
provision; in 1973 its profits were only sufficient to pay legal dividends on
its prefered shares and a cash dividend of 1% on its ordinary stock; in 1974,
the ccmpany registered a net loss and paid no dividends. Electrolima's net



- 10 -
cash generation was negative in 1972-74 and it met its financing requirements by
an equity contribution from the Government in 1972 and short-term borrowing in
1973; subsequently, the refinancing of some of its short-term debt and the
conversion of Government loans into equity in 1974 reduced the severity of the
company's immediate cash requirements. Electrolima's financial performance in
1975 has improved significatnly by virtue of a 30% increase in its tariff
levels put into effect in February 1975 and a further 6.6% increase effective
July 1, which have resulted in net internal cash generation of about $6.7 million
in 1975. These tariff increases are a step in the right direction, resulting
in a projected surplus for 1976 which will cover 30% of the compary's capital
expenditures during the year; although this coverage of capital expenditures
from internal sources is somewhat lower than desirable for pawer distribution
companies, further tariff adjustments so that at least 45% of capital expendi-
tures be financed from internal cash generation in 1977 and thereafter, have
been agreed upon (Section 4.05 of the Project Agreement).
Estimated Cost and Financing
31.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $137.3 million of which
$135.2 million are for Electrolima's expansion program and $2.1 million for the
sector technical assistance. Total foreign exchange costs are estimated at
$35.3 million of which $33.4 million are for Electrolima's expansion program and
$1.9 million for sectoral technical assistance. These cost estimates include
allowances for increases in both quantities and prices which amount to $6.8 mil-
lion and $28.1 million respectively. Price increases have been estimated at a
rate of 12% per annum in 1976, 10% in 1977 and 9% in 1978 for local currency
costs, and at 10% in 1976 and 8% in 1977 and 1978 for foreign costs. The rates
used to calculate price contingencies for the local currency costs of the project
are lower than the expected inflation rates for Peru because Electrolima has
received informal quotations for most of the equipment and services to be
obtained which indicate that such lower rates are appropriate. Also, relatively
low physical contingencies of 5% for the transmission and subtransmission
components of the project and 10% for the rest have been assumed since final
designs are well advanced for most project components and no major civil works
are involved in the project.
32.       The proposed $36.0 million loan would finance the foreign exchange
cost of the project (except for $3.0 million of urgently-needed imported equip-
ment which Electrolima has contracted using procurement procedures not in
accordance with the Bank guidelines) plus $3.7 million interest during construc-
tion. The balance of the sector technical assistance component of the project
will be financed by Government through budgetary allocations and the balance
of the Electrolima expansion program plus $15.2 million of required working
capital increases, will be financed by the company's own cash generation
($61.4 million), connection fees ($35.8 million), long term borrowing from the
State-owned development finance company - COFIDE - ($32.2 million) and
Government equity contributions ($23.6 million).



Procurement and Disbursement
33.       All purchase3 by Electrolima for Bank-financed equipment would be made
after international comapetitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines
for Procurement. In accordance with 'Peruvian legislation purchases of equipment
and materials which are produced in Peru (representing about one third of the
total expansion program) will be made domestically and will not be financed by
the Bank; similar imported equipment would cost about 30% less than such non-
competitive locally-manufactured equipment, so that reserve procurement of these
items has the effect of increasing the project cost by about 10%. Consultant
services to be used by both the Company and the sector would be employed under
terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.
34.       Disbursement3 will be made on the following basis:   (a) the CIF cost
of imported equipment and materials; (b) the cost of consultant services and
training; and (c) interest and other charges on the loan due on or before
April 15, 1979. Disbui^sements would be made for expenditures incurred after
July 1, 1975, for the ])urchase of equipment and materiaLs made in accordance
with the Bank Guidelines for Procurement. The amount of retroactive financing
involved would not exceed $1.1 million. Based on the project execution sched-
ule, the proposed loan would be fully disbursed by December 1979.
Justification
35.       It is not possible to give a single estimate of the economic rate of
return of a transmission and distribution project, because (a) the tariffs charged
are a regulated price not necessarily reflecting the full value of the service to
the consumer and (b) the economic cost of generating the additional power to be
distributed is not known with certainty. However, taking the proposed tariff
levels as the minimum value consumers put on the service, and making alternative
reasonable assumptions about the marginal economic cost of generating power,
the economic rate of return of the project can be estimated to be no less than
9% and under plausible assumptions, may be as high as 15.7%. This range compares
favorably with the one of the probable opportunity cost of capital in Peru,
particularly when the relatively low risk of the project is taken into account.
By providing facilities to expand Lima's distribution system and thus meet
future demand for electricity in that city, which accounts for 35% of the
national market, an important constraint for future growth will be removed.
Also, the project would be instrumental in making available public-service
electricity to the poor settlements in the outskirts of the city of Lima (pueblos
jovenes) since  Electrolima  would build   distribution facilities in them,
including the necessary substations and transmission lines; it is expected that
the number of households in pueblos jovenes with public-service electricity
would increase by about 300% by mid-1979, thereby contributing to alleviate
the present poor living conditions of those areas of Metropolitan Lima. In
addition planning and management of the power sector would be strengthened by
the technical assistance component of the project through providing the Govern-
ment with a master plan, aiding the Government in organizing the sector more
efficiently and training of key administrative, operative and planning personnel.

PART V - LBGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
36.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Peru and the Bank,
the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and Electrolima, the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of the draft resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
37.       The draft Loan and Project Agreements conform to the normal pattern
for loans for power projects. A speoial condition to the effectiveness of the
Loan is that the Borrower and Electrolima enter into contractual arrangements
for relending to Electrolima of part of the proceeds of the Loan. (Section
6.01(b) of draft Loan Agreement).
38.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
39.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

/ As there was a severe economic crisis in Peru 1967-68, it would not be meaningful to show the usual period 1965-70.        Instead
the chosen periods are "before the crisis" and "since the crisis".
3/ No trend exists, values are very scattered with a sharp peak in 1970, a year of record current account surplus.
4/ Refers to 1962-68.
5/ Total labor force; unemployed are allocated to sector of their normal occupation. "Unallocated" consists mainly of unemployed
workers seeking their first job.
6/ Comprises Manufacturing, Construction and Mining.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION :LV
Loan No. 418-PE: San Lorerrzo Irrigation Project; U$11 million Loan of June
7, I965;, Effective Date: November 24, 1965; Closing
Date: June 30, 1976
Because of inadequiacy of water supply, the Bank agreed to reduce the
project area; consequently, the project was redefined and the original loan amount
of US$11.0 million was redu- ed to US$6.5 million. (See Memorandum to the Executive
Directors "Peru; Proposed Change in Loan 418-PE", February 28, 1968-33). The
Closing Date, originally June 20, 1967, was postponed four times, first to June 30,
1969, then to December 31, :L973, then to December 31, 1974, aad then to June 30,
1976. The last postponement of the CLosing Date was granted to allo the Borrower
to use the undlsbursed amount of the loan (US$350,000) for the replacement of a
valve at the San Lorenzo reservoir, which is important for the overall operation
~/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and. in particuls to report any problems
wbich are being encountered, and the action being taken to reme4y them.
They should be read in *this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

of the system. The project has encountered a number of difficulties, both
administrative and technical but these problems are being overcome.   Project
management has been strengthened and the last part of the project related to the
drainage scheme is progressing satisfactorily. The Loan is expected to be fully
disbursed by the revised Closing Date.
Loan 706-PE: Road Reconstruction Project; US$30 million Loan of September 14,
1970; Effective Date: October 26, 1970; Closing Date: March 31, 1977
This Loan was signed only three and a half months after the earthquake
in the Callejon de Huaylas. However, the identification, feasibility study and
final engineering of the roads to be improved have taken much longer than expected
because of a too optimistic assessment at the time of appraisal, because of
administrative and coordination difficulties in connection with the on-going
decentralization of the Central Government, and because of problems with the
consultants engaged to study and supervise the project. Construction of a short
section of road near Huaraz, the capital of the region, is near completion. Work
is well advanced on the two remaining sections along the Callejon; bidding for
the access road has now taken place and construction of this last section has
also started. The road reconstruction element of the project is expected to be
completed by the end of 1976, 15 months later than the original Closing Date of
the Loan, which has been extended accordingly.
Loan 933-PE: Agricultural Credit Project; US$25.0 million Loan of September
12, 1973; Effective Date: December 12, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
The Loan was signed in September 1973 and became effective on December
12, 1973. Although the project had a slow start, progress is now satisfactory.
Disbursements are slightly behind schedule.
Loan 949-PE: Education Project; US$24.o million Loan of December 5, 1973;
JTective Date: March 5 1974;    Closing Date:   June 30, 1979
This Loan became effective on March 5, 1974. Serious initial delays
were caused by administrative difficulties with the Project Unit and late appointment
of counterpart staff to the consultants who were to define curricula for the ESEPs
(Escuelas Superiores de Esefnanza Profesional). The recent change of status of the
Project Unit which has been upgraded to the rank of Directorate General and the
strengthened management of the project have markedly improved the prospects for
efficient implementation of the project.
Loan 1025-PE: Sixth Highway Project; U$26 million Loan of July 1, 1974;
Effective Date: August 21, 197T; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Bids for construction works were invited in October 1974, on the basis
of the official cost estimates, but contractors failed to respond. After an
upward revision of the cost estimates new invitations to bid were issued in March
1975. Contractors response this time has been positive and bids for all sections
have been submitted and contracts were awarded in August 1975. Project
implementation is eight months behind schedule.
