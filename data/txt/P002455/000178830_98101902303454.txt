SOMALIA - FOURTH PORT PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:           Somali Democratic Republic
Beneficiary:        Somali Ports Authority (SPA)
Amount:             US$5.5 million
Terms:              Standard IDA terms
On-Lending          The proceeds of the Credit will be onlent by the Somali
Terms:            Democratic Republic to SPA for a period of 20 years,
at an interest rate of 7-1/2 percent per annum.
Project             The Project is intended to provide a conventional tanker
Description:      pier in Mogadishu deep-water harbor.  It would be used for
receiving inbound crude oil for the Mogadishu oil refinery
and for outbound refined products. Its layout and design
will make provision for its possible future use also for
handling bulk grain, sugar and molasses. The Project
consists of:
(a) a tanker pier for crude oil tankers of maximum 50,000
dwt and for small-products' tankers;
(b) pipelines within the port limits;
(c) hydraulic model tests, site investigations, detailed
engineering, preparation of tender documents, assis-
tance during tendering and supervision of construction
of the tanker terminal, and
(d) site investigations, detailed engineering, preparation
of tender documents and assistance during tendering by
consulting engineers for a 210-meter extension of the
existing banana quay in Mogadishu harbor.
Benefits            The quantifiable benefits of the Project consist of cost
and Risks:        savings due to reduced ship waiting time as a result of
released general cargo berth capacity. The weakness in
SPA's management, coupled with the recent transfer of
operations from lighterage port to the new deep water
facility entail some risk in respect to future effective
working of the Port.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE SOMALI DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC FOR A
FOURTH PORT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Somali Democratic Republic for the equivalent of US$5.5 million
on standard IDA terms to help finance the Fourth Port Proiect. The proceeds
of the Credit would be onlent to the Somali Ports Authority for a period of 20
years, at an interest rate of 7-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        A Country Economic Memorandum (Report 1421a-SO) was distributed to
the Executive Directors on April 18, 1977. An IDA economic mission is cur-
rently visiting Somalia. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        The Somali Democratic Republic was formed in 1960 by a merger of
the former Italian Trust Territory of Somalia and the British Protectorate
of Somaliland. Following a decade of parliamentarv rule. the Government was
taken over by the military in 1969. The Supreme Revolutionary Council, con-
sisting of army and police officers became, in fact, the highest policy-making
body until mid-1976 when it was abolished and a political party, the Somali
Revolutionary Socialist Party, was formed and became the key political
institution.
4.        Since 1970 the Government has adhered to a program of "scientific
socialism", emphasizing egalitarianism and social justice, development through
the public sector, nationalization of certain foreign enterprises, and the
formation of cooperatives. While the Government has always stated that there
is room for private initiative in Somalia and several privately financed proj-
ects have been implemented, the main emphasis has been given to development
of the public sector. The Government's development efforts have been charac-
terized by austerity and self-reliance.
5.        Somalia is located on the Horn of Africa with three thousand kilo-
meters of coastline on the Gulf of Aden on the north and the Indian Ocean on
the east. The topography varies from a hot and arid coastal plain, which gives
1/   This section is the same as that of the Mogadishu Water Supply and
Technical Assistance Projects.



- 2 -
way to sparsely wooded savannah, to rugged mountains, agricultural plateaus and
lowlands of varying fertility and rainfall. Much of the country is arid; water
supplies are scattered and often unreliable, and periodic droughts bring hard-
ship to both the people and their livestock. Only a small proportion of the
land, approximately 13%, is arable. While the existence of several minerals
has been confirmed, exploration is still in the early stages and commercial
viability remains to be proved. Short of other known resources, Somalia's
prospects center on agricultural and livestock development in which progress
will depend upon careful management of scarce land and water resources.
6.        With an estimated per capita income in the order of US$110 in 1976,
Somalia is classified by the UN as one of the 25 least developed countries
of the world. Of the total population of approximately 3 million, about two-
thirds are nomads and semi-nomads, who depend on livestock for their livelihood
and about 20-25% are farmers cultivating land along the Juba and Shebelli
rivers and in the higher-rainfall North-West region. The small monetary sector
of the economy provides only limited opportunities for employment. Apart from
the traditional export of livestock, commercial agriculture is mainly centered
on the production and export of bananas, in which Italian concession holders
are still important, and the production of sugar for the domestic market. The
expansion of manufacturing and other service sectors of the economy is limited
by the small size of the domestic market, poor infrastructure, and the shortage
of capital and entrepreneurial experience. No income distribution data exist,
but the Bank estimates that about 70% of the population live at subsistence
levels of about US$200-250 per family of five. Social services are still very
inadequate; the school enrollment ratio was until recently among the lowest
in the world but took a great leap forward in the past two years. There is
little economic data on Somalia. Even basic figures such as GNP, population,
number of livestock, or output of major agricultural crops are only rough
estimates. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to measure economic perfor-
mance except in a very rough manner.
Political Changes and their Economic Consequences
7.        The effect of recent political events on economic development
policy in Somalia is bound to be rather limited because of the lack of alter-
native strategies to the one currently followed. However, some change was
perceived in recent months as evidenced by a revision (and liberalization)
of the law on foreign investment of 1960 and the reappointment of a tech-
nician as Chairman of the Planning Commission.
8.        Since various state enterprises (such as the Kismayu Meat Factory
and the Las Koreh Fish Factory) were organized with Soviet assistance, the
departure of Soviet technicians will cause problems in these firms and in the
Planning Commission, which also received Soviet personnel. However, the real
need for replacements is estimated to be substantially less than the number
of departures (estimated at 200-250 civilian technicians).



- 3-
Development Planning Achievements
9.        The long-range objectives of the Government are strongly influenced
by the desire to be self-reliant. The Government is seeking to make the
country self-sufficient in agriculture through both an expansion of the area
under cultivation and the development of irrigation while trying to provide
permanent settlement for many of the nomads and putting considerable emphasis
on modernizing and mobilizing the population. Of central importance for
achieving these objectives are education, rural literacy and self-help pro-
grams such as those in agriculture and public works (referred to as "Crash
Programs"). Finally, the Government places emphasis on developing infra-
structure, especially transportation and communications.
10.       Since the bulk of the population is engaged in herding or in sub-
sistence farming, a development strategy for Somalia must start with agri-
culture and livestock as a base. The major development goals of the Somali
Government include self-sufficiency in foodgrains, the partial substitution of
other food imports (oils, rice) and improvement of the lot of the traditional
nomadic herdsmen through settlement programs and improvements in livestock
production and marketing facilities. The current Plan's emphasis on irrigated
agriculture is meant to make the country less dependent on the erratic pattern
of rainfall, and assure more stable and predictable increases in output.
Attention is also being given to projects in rainfed agriculture (mainly
through the Government-financed self-help projects, the IDA-financed rainfed
crop production project under the Juba-Shebelli Area Emergency Settlement
Scheme and the North-West Region Agricultural Development Project) which focus
on making the best use of the limited amount of rainfall. Improvements in
livestock production and marketing are being promoted by the IDA-financed
Trans-Juba Livestock Project designed to provide market access to the nomads
in the southern part of the country and the Kuwait Fund-financed Northern
Rangelands Project with emphasis on rehabilitation of the denuded rangelands
in the North. The Plan continues to base its development of industry on the
processing of domestic raw materials to substitute for imports.
11.       The 1974-78 Five-Year Plan, as originally conceived, called for
investments of So.Sh. 3.9 billion and was probably overly ambitious, both with
respect to financial and implementation constraints. Because of inflation,
the cost of carrying out the same (physical) investment program will now
require an additional So.Sh. 1 billion. A review of Plan implementation after
three years shows (financial) rates of implementation of 46.2%, 40.8% and
77% in 1974, 1975 and 1976, respectively. If adjustments for investments
outside the Plan (mainly drought relief and rehabilitation) were made, they
would show implementation rates (in financial terms) of about 60% in 1974 and
55% in 1975. In absolute terms, annual investment therefore increased from
about So.Sh. 340 million in 1973 to an average of So.Sh. 500-600 million in
1974-75 and to about So.Sh. 700 million in 1976 which suggests that annual
investment in real terms is increasing. However, it also seems that an
essentially financial constraint in 1974 has turned into an implementation
constraint in 1976. The implementation constraint is particularly acute as
the result of a sharp exodus of skilled Somalis to the neighboring oil-
exporting countries.



-4 -
12.       The Government's achievements over the past several years have been
impressive by any standard. Before the present Government came to power in
1969, the economy was stagnant and the Government often in severe financial
difficulties. Today the pace of development (as measured by public investment)
has quickened and a far higher level of public services is being supplied.
13.       Two fields where the Government's achievements have been particularly
outstanding have been in the settlement of nomads and in education. Within
a period of less than one year beginning in the summer of 1975, more than
100,000 nomads were transported from the arid rangelands of the North and
settled on unutilized agricultural areas in the South. Small harvests have
already been reaped and this has encouraged both the Government and the
settlers. In education, the Government has concentrated on two aspects:
basic education (literacy and numeracy) for all people, young and old, to
enable them to effectively participate in the social, economic and political
process; and specialized manpower training as a requirement for national
development. With respect to the former, the mass literacy campaign conducted
in the years 1973, 1974 and 1975 at a cost of So.Sh. 100 million (US$16
million) has resulted in an increase in the adult literacy ratio from about 5%
to about 50-60%, according to Government estimates. The formal primary school
enrollment ratio has risen from less than 15% of the relevant age group a few
years ago to approximately 34% at present, and universal primary education may
be reached by the mid-1980's. A script, introduced by the Government in 1972,
made the writing of the Somali language possible for the first time, and this
removed one of the major constraints to progress in the field of education.
With respect to manpower development, the Government is concentrating on the
training of high- and middle-level personnel in its principal development
sectors--agriculture and livestock.
Recent Economic Performance
14.       Poor rainfall in 1973 and a virtual absence of rain during 1974 and
the first half of 1975 led to widespread crop f-ailures. The drought hurt
exports of livestock and bananas, the two largest earners of foreign exchange,
and resulted in large imports of maize, sorghum, rice and sugar. The entire
central and northeastern parts of the country were affected, as well as a
large part of the population, mostly nomads. Iln 1976, the Somali economy
experienced a further slight recovery from the effects of the serious drought
of 1973-75, mainly on account of continued expansion in Government expenditure,
which contributed to substantial increases in overall investment and consumption.
15.       Since 1973, production and exports of bananas have continued to
decline and export volume in 1976 amounted to 72,500 metric tons, only 54
percent of the 1972 level. It is expected to have fallen further in 1977,
partly because of a disruption in exports to the Middle East on account of a
commercial dispute. Because of a flood which seriously affected growing areas
in late 1977, recovery of production and exports of bananas may be delayed
further. A partial recovery in output of local food grains was evidenced by
increases in marketed quantities in 1976/77 when the Agricultural Development
Corporation purchased 54,000 tons of grains, up from 45,000 tons the previous
year, but only 55% of the predrought level.



16.       Somalia's manufacturing sector consists of a few relatively large-
scale, public-owned enterprises and a large number of small private enterprises.
In 1973, the public sector accounted for about 80% of value added in industry
then estimated at US$20 million. Most of the industries are agro-based,
depending upon locally produced raw materials. After making strong progress
in the period 1968-70, industrial production stagnated from 1971 to 1973 but
appears to have picked up since. Several investments were made in the latter
period such as a brick factory, a flour and pasta mill, grain mills, and a
corrugated carton factory. Existing plants, especially the sugar complex and
the textile factory, were expanded and modernized. Also, increased fishing
capacity is contributing to the improved performance of the fish factory.
Construction of a 500,000-ton petroleum refinery is nearly completed. Short-
ages of technical and managerial staff and in some cases lack of domestic
inputs have resulted in underutilized capacity, and the recent departure of
Soviet technicians is aggravating this problem in specific industries.
17.       Somalia's fiscal performance has continued to be encouraging, and
budgetary savings will remain an important goal of the Government. Together
with the many self-help projects, the country's efforts to help finance its
investments provide evidence of commitment to self-reliance. Since 1971 when
the Government succeeded in reversing a ten-year history of budget deficits, a
surplus has emerged every year (approximately $5.2 million in 1976). However,
the increasing supply of Government services nation-wide and the recurrent
cost implication of recent large public investments will make it increasingly
difficult for the budget to generate substantial savings.
18.       To raise Government revenues will probably require a reform of the
tax system and identification of new sources of revenue, including measures to
mobilize remittances of Somalis working abroad. In addition, ways of improving
efficiency in parastatal enterprises are necessary to turn them into larger
and growing sources of public savings. A World Bank mission recently studied
state firms and discussed its findings with the Government. Further assistance
to Somalia in this matter is being contemplated.
19.       Somalia's balance on goods and services has been in deficit since
Independence. The gap has grown from US$18.6 million in 1970 to US$110
million in 1976 and US$154.2 million in 1977, largely as a result of rapid
growth in merchandise imports. Imports (f.o.b.) have risen steadily from
US$56.8 million in 1971 to US$153 million in 1976 and US$193.5 million in
1977. 1/ The Government's comprehensive import licensing system can only have
a limited impact, since development-related imports (which are not actively
limited) already accounted for 40% of the total in 1974 and undoubtedly
account for a higher share at present while another non-compressible import,
food, accounted for a further 35-40%. Exports jumped from US$31.9 million in
1970 to US$85.3 million in 1975 but have stagnated at about US$80 million in
1/   Foreign trade statistics for 1976 have been revised downward but still
remain provisional; data for 1977 are preliminary estimates based on
returns for the first 10 months.

1976 and 1977. Also, increasing banana prices more than offset a marked
decline in volume exported in 1975 and 1976 but prices stopped rising in 1977
and export receipts actually dropped. The overall balance of payments in 1977
is likely to show a small surplus (in the range of US$7-8 million) as has been
the case in the last two or three years because of large transfers and net
capital inflow.
20.       In view of Somalia's poverty, external assistance has played a major
role in the financing of investment for the development of the country.
Somalia joined the Arab League in 1974 and mounted a major effort to attract
commitments of funds from the Arab petroleum exporting countries. The large
inflows of external capital and transfers from 1975 onward indicate that the
effort has been successful. Due to political events, the source of foreign
assistance has recently changed from the socialist block (except for China
which maintains a large program) towards Arab bilateral and multilateral
institutions (continuing the trend started in 1975) and Western countries,
several of which have had substantial assistance programs for a number of
years.
21.       The public external debt of Somalia as of December 1976 (outstanding
and disbursed) was approximately US$277 million. Although a large share of
this debt is on fairly soft terms, the debt service ratio has increased from
3.4% in 1972 to about 9% in 1977, and will probably continue to increase,
because of increased amounts of aid. Somalia's export prospects are rather
poor because of the concentration on two primary products--livestock and
bananas--both of which face problems in expanding production in the long run.
Livestock is subject to cyclical droughts which decrease export supplies and
competition from the Sudan and Ethiopia, and even Australia and New Zealand,
are to be reckoned with in assessing Somalia's future market position in Saudi
Arabia. Banana exports have fallen because of both supply (drought, floods,
poor marketing practices) and demand (increasing competition from multinationals
in both Italy and the Middle East) problems. Diversification efforts have
been attempted in hides and skins and fisheries with limited success but are
bound to receive a setback with the withdrawal of Soviet technical assistance
which was especially important in all aspects of fisheries and processing of
fish. Therefore, in view of the country's poverty and uncertain export
prospects, assistance should be provided on the softest terms possible and
contain provisions for local currency financing.
PART II - BANK GROUP CPERATIONS IN SOMALIA 1/
22.       Starting in 1965 IDA has made 16 Credits totalling about US$105
million of which about 35% have been made for transportation development,
including construction of three trunk roads and a new deepwater port and
associated extensions at Mogadishu. IDA Credits were also made for livestock
development in FY74, for a development finance company project in FY77, and
1/   This section is the same as that of Mogadishu Water Supply and Technical
Assistance Projects.



for education in FY71, FY75 and FY78. Lending for agriculture commenced in
FY76 with two Credits for a Drought Rehabilitation Project and a North-West
Region Agricultural Development Project. A Credit for development of water
supply in Mogadishu and a technical assistance Credit for project prepara-
tion were approved recently. No Bank loan or IFC investment has been made
to Somalia. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA Credits as of
June 16, 1978 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects. Performance
on ongoing projects generally has been satisfactory. However, as the pace
of development continues to rise, absorptive capacity constraints are likely
to become increasingly evident, especially in the field of agriculture where
projects are rather complex and implementation experience is limited. There-
fore, in preparing and appraising new projects, particularly close attention
will have to be paid to implementation capacity and the adoption of measures
to ease this constraint when necessary.
23.       We plan to direct our future efforts on the country's directly
productive sectors, agriculture and livestock, and also on education and
transportation. While agriculture and livestock offer potential for devel-
opment, most rural development activities are only at the beginning stage.
Moreover, agricultural development in Somalia is particularly difficult
because most of the people in rural areas are nomadic. For these reasons,
we plan that much of our future lending will be in the agriculture and live-
stock sectors, and this will be complemented with near equal attention on
education. In the future we intend to seek Board approval for an Agricul-
tural Extension and Training Project, a Central Rangeland Livestock Project
and an agricultural project for the Bay Region. In addition to these sec-
tors, we plan to support the Government's industrial development efforts
(and assist in the formulation of an industrial development policy) through
our country economic work and future DFC projects. We also plan to continue
assistance to the water supply sector.
24.       To facilitate the development and implementation of the Associa-
tion's growing operational program in Somalia, we recently established, a
one-man resident mission. The mission represents the Bank Group in its
contacts with the Government thus facilitating an efficient and smooth day-
to-day working relationship and assists in coordination of the cofinancing
efforts.
25.       Although the situation in the Horn of Africa is a cause for concern,
the impact of the recent events on our operations has not been much. Only one
project, i.e., North-West Agriculture Development Project, was affected in the
sense that the management consultants invoked "force majeure" and left the
project area. However, since the troop withdrawal in March, 1978, conditions
in Northwest Somalia are returning to normal and the Government intends to
proceed with implementation of the Project until new management consultants
are appointed.



-8-
26.       Implementation of other projects is proceeding generally satisfac-
torily, although some are affected by shortages of qualified staff, adminis-
trative and other factors which sometimes slow project implementation.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
27.       The exploitation of Somalia's limited resources has been inhibited
by the lack of adequate transportation facilities. The density of freight
and passenger traffic is light in all modes. Although some 10,400 motor
vehicles operate in the country, camels and donkeys continue to play an
important part as reliable means of transport.
Road Transport
28.       The road network is still limited and comprises about 17,700 km, of
which some 1,400 km are bituminous surfaced roads and about 1,000 km are gravel
roads. Long distances and light traffic densities make road projects difficult
to justify economically although they are necessary to ensure national unity
and administrative accessibility. IDA has financed the Afgoi-Baidoa highway,
providing a road link from Mogadishu through the center of its hinterland and
the Hargeisa-Berbera road, and is currently financing the construction of a
paved road from Hargeisa to Borama (113 km) with a link to Tug Wajale (19 km)
under the Third Road Project. A 1,045 km road, financed by the People's
Republic of China, is under construction from Belet Uen in the central region,
to Burao in the north, and the unpaved section (275 km) of the coastal road
between Kismayu and Mogadishu are now being paved under a project financed by
the European Development Fund.
Ports
29.       Four major ports accommodate practically all of Somalia's shipping.
Of these, ports with deep-water facilities are: Berbera, which exports mostly
livestock; Mogadishu, which imports most of the country's general cargo; and
Kismayu, which exports bananas and meat. Merca, which exports bananas, is a
lighterage port. The new deep-water port at Mogadishu financed jointly by IDA
(Credits 359-SO and 586-SO) and the European Development Fund, was inaugurated
on October 22, 1977.
30.       Most of Somalia's international trade is handled by foreign vessels,
supplemented by the National Shipping Line, which was established in 1974 as
a joint venture of the Governments of Somalia (51% ownership) and Libya. This
line operates two refrigerator ships, of 4,000 dwt and 4,700 dwt capacity,
a livestock-carrying ship of 12,500 dwt capacity and two small general cargo
vessels of 1,500 and 2,000 dwt capacity.



-9-
31.       Despite the long coastline, transport by coastal shipping within
Somalia is limited because there has been little inter-regional trade suitable
for such shipping. However, a cement plant under construction in Berbera
will send most of its annual output (100,000 tons) by sea to Mogadishu.
Similarly, petroleum products from the new refinery outside Mogadishu will
be transferred by small tankers to Berbera and Kismayu. Current development
of commercial fishing is also expected to stimulate some growth of coastal
shipping because the fish are to be transported from a number of small ports
to a few processing and distribution centers, particularly Mogadishu and
Berbera.
Civil Aviation
32.       The air transport system in Somalia serves ten scattered regional
centers, with Mogadishu as the focal point. Only three airports have paved
runways. Somali Airlines operates three DC-3's, two turbo-prop aircraft
(F-27 and Viscount) on its domestic routes. Two Boeing 720 jet aircraft
connect Mogadishu with Rome, Cairo, Nairobi, Djibouti and various points on
the Arabian Peninsula. A few foreign airlines link Somalia with other African
countries and Europe.
Transport Policy. Planning and Coordination
33.       The Government's transport objectives, as indicated in the 1974-78
Plan, are to (i) open new areas for development and thus increase the economy's
productive capacity; (ii) foster regional economic integration of the country's
many isolated areas; and (iii) lower the cost of, and facilitate domestic
transport, thereby reducing the disparity between rural and urban areas in
price and availability of goods. The Government intends to achieve these
goals primarily through construction of main and feeder roads; two of these
main roads are included in the Third Road Project. Other key plans are the
completion of the Mogadishu harbor and relocation of its airport, improvement
of the Hargeisa airport, and strengthening of the Somali Airlines and the
National Shipping Line.
34.       Transport and communications account for 25% of total planned public
investment over the 1974-78 Plan period, compared with 29% of actual invest-
ment in the previous Three-Year Plan. Within the transport and communications
sector of the 1974-78 Plan period, 73% of the investments are allocated to
highways, 19% to ports and shipping, 3% to civil aviation and 5% to communica-
tions. While the current investment plan is not likely to be fully imple-
mented, a substantial portion of the investments will probably be made and the
country's transport infrastructure is expected to continue to improve over the
1974 78 Plan period.



- 10 -
35.       Four ministries are concerned with the transport sector; the Minis-
try of Public Works which, through its Civil Engineering Department, is
responsible for highway maintenance and for planning and construction of
highways, ports and airports; the Ministry of Transport which is responsible
for vehicle registration and control, and for civil aviation through its Civil
Aviation Department; the Ministry of Marine Transport and Ports which, through
the Somali Ports Authority, is responsible for port operations and, through the
National Shipping Line, is responsible for marine transport planning; and the
Ministry of Interior which is responsible for highway traffic control. No
Government agency exists to oversee the functioning of the whole sector, but
some limited coordination is provided by the Planning Commission.
36.       Intermodal coordination is not an issue; there is no railway nor
are there any plans for one, and the limited coastal shipping is not likely
to increase significantly in the foreseeable future with the exception of
cement and petroleum products.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
37.       A report entitled "Staff Appraisal Report, Mogadishu Fourth Port
Project--Somalia" (No. 1967-SO) dated June 20, 1978 is being distributed sepa-
rately. A Credit and Project Summary appears at the beginning of this report
and a Supplementary Project Data Sheet is given in Annex III. The Project
was prepared by the Government with assistance of consultants, and appraised
by an IDA Mission in December 1977. Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C.
from April 17 to 19, 1978. The Somali Delegation was headed by Mr. Abdurahman
Nur Herzi, Economic Advisor to the President of Somali Democratic Republic.
38.       Somalia and Iraq have jointly constructed a petroleum refinery
some 15 km south of Mogadishu which will be in operation by July 1978. The
refinery will be operated by experienced Iraqi technicians while Somali per-
sonnel is trained in Iraq. It is expected that the refinery will operate
at full capacity, 500,000 tons per year, from the start and that the surplus
which is not consumed within Somalia will be marketed abroad with the assis-
tance of Iraq. Present consumption in Somalia amounts to about 200,000 tons
of petroleum products per annum. Imports of crude oil and exports of refined
petroleum products will temporarily be handled at the third general cargo
berth in the new deep-water Port of Mogadishu. This is both a wasteful use
of an expensive general cargo berth and a hazardous operation.
Project Objective and Description
39.       The purpose of the Project is to provide economical and safe facil-
ities for accommodating petroleum tankers carrying crude oil for the new
Mogadishu refinery, and for smaller tankers transporting petroleum products
from the refinery. The proposed facility would be a tanker pier in the



- 11 -
Mogadishu deep-water harbor. However, its layout and design will also pro-
vide for its future use for handling bulk grain, sugar and molasses. At
the Government's request, engineering preparations of the next extension
of Mogadishu harbor have also been included in the Project, as there are
considerable savings in combining this with engineering of the proposed
tanker terminal.
40.       Specifically, the Project would comprise:
(a)  a tanker pier for crude oil tankers of maximum 50,000 dwt and
for small products tankers. It consists of a loading/unloading
platform, berthing platforms and mooring platforms connected
to shore by a causeway and/or trestles which would carry a
crude oil pipeline and petroleum products pipelines and a
roadway for light trucks. The platforms will either consist
of concrete caissons or be supported on steel piles;
(b)  pipelines within the port limits;
(c)  hydraulic model tests, site investigations, detailed engineer-
ing, preparation of tender documents, assistance during tender-
ing and supervision of construction of the tanker terminal by
consulting engineers; and
(d)  site investigations, detailed engineering, preparation of
tender documents and assistance during tendering by consulting
engineers for a 210 meter extension of the existing banana quay
in Mogadishu harbor for general cargo traffic, the construction
of which will be optional under the tanker terminal contract
(but not financed under the proposed Credit).
41.       Total Project cost, including contingencies, is estimated at US$6.6
million,of which US$5.5 million is in foreign currency. The Project is
exempted from duties and taxes. Project costs are outlined below.

Cost estimates for civil works are based upon the preliminary project design
prepared by consultants after studying the technical feasibility of the Proj-
ect. An additional allowance of 10% has been provided for physical contin-
gencies. Annual price contingency factors ranging from 7% to 8% were applied
for the civil works. Cost estimates for consultants' services are based on a
lump-sum proposal, without price escalation, which has been submitted to the
Ministry of Public Works; the average man-month cost for each consultant is
US$6,000.
Financing
42.       The proposed Credit of US$5.5 million equivalent would be used to
finance all foreign costs, representing 83% of total project costs. These
would include costs of the project preparation paid by advances under the
Project Preparation Facility (US$0.5 million). The advances would be reim-
bursed from the proposed Credit when it becomes effective. The Goverrunent
will provide for local currency expenditures.
43.       When construction of the new tanker terminal is completed, it will
be handed over to and owned by the Somali Ports Authority which will be
responsible for its operation and maintenance (see para. 44). The resulting
loan from the Government to SPA, covering the equivalent in Somali shillings
of the proposed Credit, will be for a term of twenty years at an interest rate
of 7-1/2% per annum. The above conditions would be reflected in a subsidiary
loan agreement to be entered into between the Government and SPA, execution of
which is an additional condition of effectiveness (draft Development Credit
Agreement, Sections 3.01 and 6.02).
Implementation
44.       The Project will be carried out by the Civil Engineering Department
of the Ministry of Public Works with the assistance of consultants. The
Civil Engineering Department has in the past carried out several IDA-financed
projects satisfactorily. Implementation of the Project will require about
thirty months. When the Project is completed, it will be handed over to the
Somali Ports Authority for operation and maintenance.
45.       The management of the Somali Ports Authority would need strength-
ening, particularly in planning, accounting, and management information sys-
tems. Under a previous Project (Credit 359-SO), Price Waterhouse Associates
(consultants) made a study of SPA's management, accounting and operations and
have made several proposals for improvements. To implement consultants'
recommendations and to train SPA's staff, a management expert experienced
in these fields would be needed. Assurances have been obtained that a suit-
ably qualified port management expert with terms of reference satisfactory to
the Association would be employed no later than December 31, 1978 (draft
Project Agreement, Section 2.02). The European Development Fund has agreed in
principle with SPA to provide the necessary financing for the port management
expert. Assurances have also been obtained that SPA will prepare a training
program for its staff in consultation with the Association and commence the
implementation of the program not later than June 1, 1979 (draft Project
Agreement, Section 3.05).



- 13 -
46.       In order to improve the performance of the Somali Ports Authority in
regard to its operation of the new alongside general cargo facilities financed
under the previous two IDA Credits, certain operational targets were prepared
by the consultants and are suitable for implementation. Assurances have been
obtained that these operating targets will be achieved (draft Project Agree-
ment, Section 2.03).
Procurement
47.       The contract for the civil works will be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines.
No local contractor is expected to qualify as the principal contractor,
although some are likely to be eligible as subcontractors or joint venture
partners.
Disbursements
48.       Disbursements from the proceeds of the proposed Credit will be
fully documented and will be on the basis of 80% of the cost of civil works
and 100% of expenditures for engineering consultants' services.
Environmental Impact
49.       The existing primitive facility for unloading crude oil and loading
petroleum products presents considerable pollution risks. The new facility
will be designed to avoid spills.
Financial Aspects
50.       SPA's operating results have been satisfactory.  Under Credit 359-
S0, SPA was required to produce a 5% annual return on net fixed assets; how-
ever, because of the subsequent extension under Credit 586-SO of the new
Mogadishu deep-water harbor, and the resulting higher investment, the re-
quirement was reduced to 4.5% for 1977, though retained at 5% for subsequent
years. SPA has consistently met the above requirements which has enabled it
to generate sufficient revenues to cover all financial requirements.
51.       SPA introduced new tariffs effective on December 1, 1977, as a
result of the tariff revision studies undertaken by Price Waterhouse & Asso-
ciates, the consultants under the previous Credit 359-SO. SPA followed the
recommendations of the consultants in general, although in some cases, where
the rates proposed by the consultants were relatively high, SPA lowered the
range somewhat. SPA's concern is that any immediate higher rates without
better quality of service would be unreasonable. As the expected operational
improvements take place, particularly in the new Mogadishu Port, SPA will
re-study the tariff situation and introduce such changes as may be necessary
to maintain as well as improve its financial performance.



- 14 -
52.       Financial projections indicate that SPA would earn annual returns
on net fixed assets ranging from 5% in 1979 to 7% in 1982. This would enable
SPA to cover its operating expenses, meet its debt service requirements and
make routine capital investment additions. However, no major ports develop-
ment, in addition to the tanker terminal, has been taken into account. To
ensure a sound financing plan for the proposed Project, assurances have been
obtained that (i) SPA will maintain its tariffs at such levels to enable it to
continue to earn an annual return of not less than 5% (draft Project Agreement,
Section 4.05); and (ii) SPA shall not, without prior consultation with the
Association, undertake any capital investment exceeding So.Sh. 6,000,000 p.a.
before completion of the Project (draft Project Agreement, Section 4.03).
53.       Since SPA's financial viability could also be endangered if it
were to incur substantial additional debt, assurances have been obtained that
SPA will not incur any additional long-term debt without the Association's
prior agreement unless its net cash revenues for the fiscal year or the twelve
consecutive months immediately before the date of incurrence, would be at
least two times its maximum debt service requirements of any succeeding year
on all SPA's debt (draft Project Agreement, Section 4.04).
54.       The Magistrate of Accounts, who is independent and reports directly
to the President, is responsible for the audit of all Government departments
and agencies in Somalia and will audit SPA's accounts. While the Magistrate
of Accounts audit of SPA's accounts has generally been satisfactory in the
past, the audit practices employed by the Magistrate need to be reviewed,
particularly in the verification phase of the work. The Association intends
to assist the Magistrate of Accounts in this area during Project implementa-
tion. Assurances have been obtained that SPA will have its accounts audited
annually by auditors acceptable to the Association and would furnish such
audited accounts to the Association not later than six months after the end
of its fiscal year (draft Project Agreement, Section 4.02).
Economic Evaluation
55.       The quantifiable benefits of the Project consist of cost savings
due to reduced ship waiting time as a result of released general cargo berth
capacity. In calculating the economic return, only half of the benefits from
reduced ship waiting time have been considered. This is due mainly to uncer-
tainty about the extent to which these benefits will be passed on to the
Somali Economy. The cost savings are estimated at US$5,000 per day, being
the average cost per day for the typical 8,000-12,000 dwt general cargo ship
calling at Mogadishu. The even higher cost per day for oil tankers is dis-
regarded as a benefit since tankers are assumed to get preferential berthing.
For the purposes of calculating the economic return, total project costs have
been adjusted by excluding price contingencies. Furthermore, a shadow rate of
about 40% above the official rate has been applied to the Project's foreign
exchange costs to reflect its estimated economic value.



- 15 -
56.       Based on the above benefits and costs, and assuming a 25-year
life, the Project is estimated to yield a quantifiable economic return of 15%
(calculated on 91% of total Project costs) in addition to the important
benefits of providing a safe and efficient tanker terminal. Without shadow
pricing foreign exchange the economic return is estimated 14%. The return
from the Project is sensitive to traffic developments, and to the cost of the
Project. If traffic falls short of forecast and the corresponding savings
from ship waiting time are assumed to be 20% less, the return from the Project
will drop to 13%. A 20% increase in cost will also lower the return to
13%.
Risks
57.       The weaknesses in SPA's management, coupled with the recent transfer
of operations from a lighterage port to the new deep-water facility, entail
some risk in respect to the future effective working of the Port. To reduce
the risks, assurances have been obtained for SPA to employ a port management
expert to assist in implementing sound management practices and training SPA's
staff (para. 45).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
58.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Somali Democratic
Republic and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Somali
Ports Authority and the Association, and the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for under Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
59.       Features of the Development Credit Agreement of special interest
are referred to in Annex III of this report.
60.       An Additional condition of effectiveness would be conclusion of a
satisfactory Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and SPA (draft
Development Credit Agreement, Section 6.01).
61.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
62.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

ever, we have since been informed that a Somali Delegation met a representa-
tive of the Contractor in Bonn on March 22, 1978, and proposed a DM 10 million
settlement and a schedule of payments. The contractor's representative
expressed interest and promised to discuss the proposal with his Board of
Directors and convey their reaction to the Somali Government. A meeting
between the Government and Contractor is scheduled for August, 1978.
Credit No. 295:     Highways II (Hargeisa-Berbera); $9.6 million Credit of
March 30, 1972; Date of Effectiveness: May 11i 1972;
Closing Date: originally December 31, 1975 and post-
poned thrice to June 30, 1978.
The construction of the Hargeisa-Berbera road was completed in
June 1975. The feasibility study and detailed engineering for the Hargeisa-
Borama road and technical assistance in transport planning have also been
completed. The Project was completed successfully.
Credit No. 359:     Port of Mogadishu; $12.95 million Credit of March 15, 1973;
Date of Effectiveness; September 10, 1973; Closing Date:
originally June 30, 1977 and postponed once to June 30, 1978.
Credit No. 586:     Mogadishu Port Extension Project; $5.2 million Credit of
October 15, 1975; Date of Effectiveness; January 15. 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The civil works, including the extension, were completed in
October 1977, six months behind schedule. Several outstanding claims of the

progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-

them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

contractor were settled in July 1977 and payment effected in April 1978. The
port operating equipment has been delivered. Because of the continuing short-
age of skilled staff in the country as a whole, the Somali Port Authority
continues to face problems in finding staff with the necessary skills to take
full advantage of the training aspects of the consultancy services provided
under the credit. As a result of the recommendations made by the consultants,
tariffs have been revised.
Credit No. 462:      Livestock (Trans-Juba) Project; $10 million Credit of
February 20, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: October 29,
1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Stock route and ranch development have made good progress but bore-
hole drilling and the veterinary assistance component are delayed. Restricted
Government financial contribution is creating a working capital shortage. FAO
has supplied an irrigation engineer, and 4 senior staff have been recruited by
the Livestock Development Agency directly from India, two of whom have already
arrived in Somalia. A recent transfer of livestock marketing responsibilities
in the project area from Livestock Development Agency to the Ministry of Indus-
try, and the resignation of the Project Director and an engineer are matters
of concern which are being discussed with Government.
Credit No. 511:      Second Education Proiect; $8 million Credit of September 19,
1974: Date of Effectiveness: December 19. 1974: Closing
Date: June 30, 1980.
The Elementary Teachers Training College is complete and in use.
Construction of the rnomadic centers, the Academy of Somali Studies and the
Fishery and Marine Institute are about a year behind schedule due to staffing
shortage of the Project Implementation Unit and delays in establishing cri-
teria for locating the Nomadic Training Centers. Construction contracts have
now been awarded for 19 of the 22 project institutions and disbursements are
expected to increase rapidly as a result. Latest cost estimates indicate an
overrun of about 3 percent which is manageable.
Credit No. 623:      Drought Rehabilitation Program -- Juba-Shebelli Emergency
Settlement Scheme; $8 million Credit of July 7, 1976;
Date of Effectiveness: August 31, 1976; Closing Date:
June 30, 1980.
Project implementation, especially procurement of vehicles and
equipment and land clearing, is slow, mainly due to high turnover of consult-
ancy staff; one settlement location as originally selected is unsuitable. The
interriverine study financed under the Project points to a much lower irriga-
tion potential than previously expected.

million Credit of July 7, 1976; Date of Effectiveness:
February 9, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
In view of the military situation in North-West Somalia, the manage-
ment consultants have left the Project area in February 1978 invoking 'force
majeure', but Somali staff continue project implementation; procurement of
equipment is on schedule. New management consultants are expected to be
appointed shortly.
Credit No. 698:      Somali Development Bank; $5 million Credit of June 1,
1977; Date of Effectiveness: February 27, 1978; Closing
Date: June 30, 1981.
This Credit was declared effective on February 27, 1978. Some com-
mitments under the technical assistance component have been made.

Date of Effectiveness: January 24, 1978; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
The contract for construction works on the Hargeisa-Borama road,
with a link to Tug Wajale, has been awarded and consultants engaged to carry
out supervision. The contractor is currently mobilizing for the construction
work. Technical proposals, from a short list of consulting firms, for provi-
sion of services covering feasibility study for the Dinsor-Bardera-Gelib road
were received and are being evaluated by the Government. The Association is
awaiting the Government's final recommendation regarding selection of the
consultants.
Credit No. 738:      Third Education Project; $8 million Credit of September 30,
1977; Date of Effectiveness: March 13,1978; Closing Date:
September 30, 1983.
This Credit was declared effective on March 13, 1978. The Govern-
ment has concluded an agreement with UNESCO for implementation of the fellow-
ship training program for curriculum development.
