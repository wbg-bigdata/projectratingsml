PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
FOURTH PORT PROJECT - CREDIT 838-SO
Preface
%redit 838-SO for the Fourth Port Project for US$ 5.5 million was
signed on August 23, 1978 and became effective June 27, 1979. The Closing
Date was June 30, 1981. Due to the high bids received for the construction
works the project was completely redesigned and resubmitted to the Board on
March 26, 1981, signed March 27, 1981 and became effective the same day.
The revised Closing Date was December 31, 1983. The Credit was disbursed
by July 1984 except for a cancellation of US$ 90,000.
This report consists of a Project Completion Report (PCR)
prepared by the Eastern and Southern Africa Projects Department. The PCR
was prepared on the basis of information contained in the Staff Appraisal
Report, a review of Bank files including supervision and progress reports,
and interviews with Government officials during a mission to Somalia in
September/October 1985.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Projecc Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OLD staff.
The draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments; their reply is shown
as an Annex.

FOURTH PORT PROJECT - CREDIT 838-SO
Highlights
1.        At the time of appraisal Somalia and Iraq had entered into an
agreement to construct a joint venture refinery 15 km south of Mogadishu.
It wa& expected that the refinery would operate at full capacity of 500,000
tonnes per year commencing in mid-1978. Consumption of refined products
within Somalia amounted to some 200,000 tonnes per year and the balance was
to be exported. The existing facility for unloading petroleum products
from small tankers was located in the open sea close to the rocky shore and
was dangerous and inefficient. The Fourth Port Project was to finance the
foreign exchange component of facilities to address these problems. In
particular the project was to provide a tanker pier for small products
tankers, the required causeway and/or trestles which would carry a crude
oil pipeline and a petroleum products pipeline, and hydraulic model tests,
site investigations, detailed engineering, preparation of tender documents,
assistance during tendering and supervisioa of construction. The project
was also to prov:Je consulting services for engineering, site
investigation, etc. for a proposed 210 m extension of the existing banana
quay.
2.        During the five years prior to appraisal, total traffic at
Mogadishu Port had been growing at an annual rate of about 12% per annum.
The project was appraised during December 1977 and the preliminary design
completed in February 1979. Bids were invited in November 1979 and the
lowest bid was approximately 3 times the appraisal estimate mainly because
shortly before bid opening bidders were informed by Government of
unexploded World War II ammunition in the dredge area. Subsequently the
original project was discarded and-it was decided to proceed with the
extension to the banana berth for which bids had already been invited. The
revised project was approved by the Board on March 26, 1981, signed and
became effective March 27, 1981. The project as originally appraised was
to be completed October 31, 1980 and Closing Date was June 30, 1981. The
revised project was to be completed June 30, 1983. The provisional
certificate for completion of works was actually issued July 10, 1983.
3.        The project as revised was estimated to have a total cost of
US$13.0 million with a foreign component of US$9.6 million. Actual cost
amounted to US$9.3 million with a foreign component of US$8.3 million.
Some of the reductions in costs were the result of foreign exchange
fluctuations.
4.        Traffic at Mogadiqhu for the seven years 1978 to 1984, excluding
petroleum products, grew at about the estimated appraisal rate. Petroleum
traffic did not materialize due to the conflict between Iraq and Iran.
However as the remaining traffi- did register a growth rate the decision to
construct a general cargo berth was, in hindsight, a fortunate decision.
In addition, the project called for the construction of sheds for cargo at



- v -
the rear of the banana berth (berth 5) and the extension (berth 6). During
implementation container traffic showed a substantial increase. It was
decided to delete the sheds and leave the areas to be used as a cuntainer
park and to construct a Ro-Ro ramp at the outer end of berth 6. The
location of the ramp is not ideal but the additional cost was minimal.
5.        Additional. points of particular interest are:
(i)      profitability of the Somalia Ports Authority was much
better than projected as revenues increased at a greater
rate than working expenses due to the increase in
traffic throughput and a tariff increase in 1983
(para. 5.01);
(ii)      dividends to the Government equal to 80% of profits were
paid or provided for in each year, and the return on net
fixed assets ranged from 16.9% (1979) to 48.2% (1984)
(para. 5.02);
(iii)      minimal progress was made in the areas of cost
accounting and institutional development (paras. 6.02
and 6.04); and
(iv)      the co-financing arrangement with DANIDA was excellent
and extremely flexible (paras. 3.17 and 3.18).

FOURTE PORT PROJECT - CREDIT 838-SO
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Somalia's transport infrastructure comprise three principal
ports, 10 airports, about 17,700 km of roads, but no railways or
pipelines. The three major ports, Berbera in the north on the Gulf of
Aden, and Mogadishu and Kismayo in the south, handle practically all of
Somalia's ocean transport. Berbera exports mostly livestock; Mogadishu
imports most of the country's general cargo; and Kismayo exports bananas
and meat. Until recent years Mecca, a lighterage port, exported bananas
but these are now trucked to Mogadishu for export. The Second and Third
Highway Projects (Credits 295-SO and Credit 699-SO) were designed, inter
alia, to -mprove the transport of livestock to Berbera. The Fourth Port
Project was designed primarily to supply a tanker pier in the port of
Mogadishu for the import of crude oil to be refined in Somalia and to
facilitate the export of refined petroleum products not consum6d within the
country. It also included pipelines within the port, hydraulic model
tests, site investigation, detailed engineering and engineering
supervision. Provision was also made for engineering for an extension to
the existing banana quay to be constructed in a follow-up project.
1.02      The First Port Project (S5-SO, US$550,000) in 1969 was for
engineering and accounting consultancy services. These preparations
resulted in the Second Port Project (359-SO, US$12.95 million) in 1973
together with an EDF grant of US$12.5 million to finance a breakwater,
three berths, a dolphin berth and associated facilities. During execution
of this project a Third Port Project (Cr.586-SO, US$5.2 million) was
approved. This project was for an additional 180 meter berth and a
corresponding extension of the breakwater. For the purpose of the Project
Completion Report the Second and Third Port Projects were treated as one.
The total costs of the two projects was only 6% above the funds originally
allocated. However, the time overrun was 40% on the Second Project and 60%
on the Third Project. The economic return on the combined projects was
slightly higher than the appraisal estimates.
1.03      The Fourth Port Project was identified during a mission to
Somalia in November/December 1976 and was appraised one year later in
December 1977. The original design at time of appraisal is set out in
para. 1.01 but was substantially revised at a later date as the lowest of
six bids received was So.SH 89.6 million as compared with the appraisal
estimate of So SH 27.7 million. The Credit, which had been approved by the
Board on July 6, 1978, had to be resubmitted and was approved on March 26,
1981. The revised legal documents were signed on March 27, 1981 and the
revised project became effecti,'e as of that date.
1.04      The IDA Credit of US$5.5 million and a Loan of about US$4.1
million equivalent from the Government of Denmark were to finance all
foreign costs and the Government was to finance the local cost component.

1.05      This completion report is based on:
(i) a review of the project files; and
(ii) information collected on a mission to Somalia luting
September/October 1985.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origin of the Project
2.01      Somalia and Iraq entered into an agreement to construct a
refinery 15 km south of Mogadishu in 1976 on a fifty-fifty basis. It was
anticipated that the refinery would operate at full capacity of 500,000
tonnes per year from mid 1978. Local consumption amounted to approximately
200,000 tonnes per year and the remainder would be exported. Imports of
crude and exports of refined petroleum products would temporarily be
handled at a tanker facility at the third general cargo berth which would
restrict the use of this berth for general cargo to half of its capacity.
2.02      At the request of the Somalia Government a Bank mission visited
Somalia from November 29 to December 12, 1976 to undertake a Ports Survey.
The survey indicated, inter alia, that a tanker terminal for Mogadishu
would be needed when the refinery was completed. It was estimated by the
mission that comoletion would probably be late 1978 or early 1979. A
tanker terminal study by consultants, financed under the Third Port Project
(Credit 586-SO), was commissioned and the preliminary report submitted June
16, 1977.
hwpraisal
2.03      The Fourth Port Project was appraised in December 1977 and was
primarily based on the need for such a terminal. Design of the terminal
and facilities was financed by the Project Preparation Facility with the
preliminary phase completed in February 1979. The Credit became effective
on June 27, 1979.
2.04      Although the Credit did not become effective until June 1979 it
was approved by the Board in July 1978, six months after appraisal, and
signed on August 23, 1978. The first supervision mission visited Somalia,
before effectiveness, during February 1979. At that time the schedule
called for completion of tender documents by July 1, 1979 and award of
contract by December 1979. During the February mission certain changes in
design recommended by the consultant were agreed with the Government and
the Association. The estimated cost of these changes amounted to
approximately So.SH 4.0 million (US$660,000 equivalent). To offset this
increase, certain cost saving measures were suggested including the use of
an SPA dredge to reduce dredging costs.
2.05      In regard to institutional and managerial improvements the SPA
was to employ a qualified and competent port management expert for a period
of it least two years. While included in the Project, financing was



-3-
obtained from EDF. Also SPA was to prepare a training program for its
staff.
Project Description
2.06      The description of the project is as follows:
(a) a tanker pier for crude oil tankers of maximum 50,000 dwt and
for small products tankers. It was to consist of a
loading/unloading platform, berthing platforms and mooring
platforms connected to shore by a causeway and/or trestles
which would carry a crude oil pipeline and petroleun products
pipelines and a roadway for small trucks;
(b) pipelines within the port limits;
(c) hydraulic model tests, site investigations, detailed
engineer4.ng, preparation of tender documents, assistance
during tendering and supervision of construction of the
tanker terminal by consulting engineers; and
(d) site investigation, detailed engineering, preparation of
tender documents and assistance during tendering by
consulting engineers for a 210 meter extension of the
existing banana quay in Mogadishu harbor for general cargo
traffic, the construction of which would be optional under
the tanker terminal contract, and would depend on the rate of
traffic growth. The option would be considered when
completion of construction of Ihe tanker terminal was
approaching.
III.  PROJECT IALENBUTArEION  ND COST
Start up
3.01      In August 1979 a meeting was held in Copenhagen for a final
review of tender documents for the civil works component of the project.
Attending the meeting were representatives of tine Government of Somalia,
the consulting engineers, and the Association. The prime purpose was to
clarify the documents and for all parties tc agree as to precisely what was
to be included, and to ensure that procedures followed Bank Guidelines.
The Association representative stated, inter alia, in his report of the
meeting " there were likely to be cost problems on this contract, as a
consequence of which early uttention should be given to possibilities for
cost adjustment". He then set out four possible alternatives for cost
savings (Memo to files dated August 10, 1S79).
3.02      Before calling for bids it was decided to use the dredged
material in reclaiming an area 200 m by 120 m behind the proposed tanker
terminal. The reclaimed area was to be protected against wave action by
using rubble mound type dykes. At Government request the consultants
updated their cost estimates on August 7, 1979 and the revised estimate



- 4 -
without contingencies was So.Sh.39.4 million compared with appraisal
estimated costs of SoSH 27.7 million.
3.03      Bids were invited from some twenty international contractors
which had prequalified. Four con.ractors submitted bids based on the
consultants design and three of these also submitted bids based on an
alternative design of their own. A fifth contractor submitted a bid based
only on his own design.
3.04      Shortly before the date set for submitting bids, one contractor
learned of the presence of unexploded ammunition within the dredge area and
informed the other contractors. During World War II the Italians dumped
large quantities of anti-tank shells in the area and the Government
employed an underwater exploration company in August 1975 to carry out an
"Unexploded Ordance Survey " in the port. The report was submitted to
Government on January 7, 1476. The main findings of the survey were:
(a) unexploded ammunition was p1resent within the dredge area;
(b) the main area of concentrati&n was defined;
(c) the exact quantity of ammunition was still undetermined but
in all probability existed in substantial amounts; and
(d) from the tests carried out on the recovered shells it seemed
likely that most o. the ammunition was probably "inert"
whilst wet, but the possible presence of other types of
ordinance in a volatile state could not be ruled out.
3.05      There is no doubt that this information was known to Government
as the issue was raised in the meeting of August 6, 1979 between the
consultants and Government representative in Copenhagen and is included in
the minutes of the meeting. Shortly before the date set for opening the
bids the Government agreed to the consultant :fficially informing all
prospective bidders. This was done by Addendum No. 5 to the tender
documents. However, the addendum was dated November 12, 1979, nine days
before the date set for bid openings; it reached the bidders only two or
three days before they submitted their bids; and it stated that "It shall
be stressed that the removal of possible explosives within the working

comment on who would be responsible for the removal, when it would be done,
or how the contractor would be compensated for possible damage to personnel
or equipment.

The appraisal eatimate was So.SH 27.7 million and the consultant's revised
estimate (para. 3.02) was So SR 39.4 million.
3.07      During January/February 1980 a consultant was retained by the
Association to prepare a statement of comparative costs based on the
consultants original estimates, the appraisal report estimates and the
contractors' quotations; and to prepare a report giving the underlying
reasons for the differences. He was also to have discussions with the SPA
consultant and the five contractors who submitted bids. The Association's
consultant submitted his detailed report on February 22, 1980. In brief
the report outlined the history leading up to the submission of the bids, a
comparative analysis of bid coste, reasons for the high bids, etc. In
summary his recommendation was t'lat tile project should be scaled down
considerably and changed to some extent by adopting the lowest bidder's
alternative design.
3.08      A Bank supervision mission was carried out in March, 1980 with
specific terms of reference to look into the high bid prices and to
determine possible courses of action to resolve the problem. A meeting was
held in Mogadishu on March 15, 1980 attended by the Ministry of Public
Works, the Chief Engineer in the Ministry, The Bank's Resident
Representative and a Bank mission comprising a Port Engineer andia
Transport Economist. The Mission members suggested several alternatives:
(a) negotiation with the low bidder on the basis of the
contractor's alternative designs;
(b) retendering with some modifications of the design to achieve
certain economies; and
(c) abandoning the proposal to build a tanker terminal and
instead build a banana berth extension i.e. a general cargo
berth, for which tenders had been invited along with
those for the tanker terminal.
3.09      The consultants strongly urged the Government to direct their
attention to the banana berth extension. The Government Lgreed to adopt
this alternative.  Appropriate design and tender documents were prepared
and tenders were invited in May 1960 following international competitive
bidding procedure. Tenders were received on June 17, 1980 from six
contractors. The lowest bid was So. Sh 41.0 million.
3.10      Based on the bid prices an economic re-evaluation of the project
was carried out which showed an economic rate of return of 21%. The
revised project was approved by the Board on March 28, 1981, signed March
27, 1981 and became effective the same day.
Revisions
3.11      The original project (para 2.06) was substantially revised.  The
following is the description of the revised project:
(a) construction of a new general cargo berth (Berth 6) as an
extension of the existing 'banana berth" (Berth 5);
(b) modification and relocation of the existing oil handling
equipment and fire fighting towers at Berth 3, so as to



- 6 -
permit the utilization of valuable berth capacity for
handling cargo ships; and
(c) crude oil and petroleum products to be handled at Berth 3
until such time as a tanker berth was built.
3.12      One new berth, plus additional general cargo capacity at Berth 3,
would result from the revised project as compared with one tanker berth
that was to be provided under the original project. Under a parallel
financing arrangement, the IDA Credit of US$5.5 million and a Loan of about
US$4.1 million equivalent from the Government of Denmark, would be used to
finance all foreign costs representing 74 percent of total project costs.
The Government of Somalia would finance all local costs amounting to US$3.4
million giving a total project cost of US$13.0 million. The original
appraisal estimate of costs was US$6.6 million with a foreign component of
US$5.5 million.
Implewutation
3.13      The civil works contract was awarded on December 14, 1980,
mobilization commenced in March 1981. Supervision of the project was by
the same firm of consultants who were responsible for the initial studies
and the final design. Their contract was signed in April 1981. The works
were expected to be completed by October 1982 and the total project by June
30, 1983.
3.14      The contractor moved quickly and by June 1981 all material and
equipment, with the exception of cement from Kenya, were in place. However
implementation was set back in early 1982 due to rough weather coupled with
an accident to the drill rig which was hit by a RO-RO vessel.
3.15      The project called for relocating the oil-handling and fire
protection equipment on berth 3. One fire tower had been damaged and was
dismantled and one of the oil unloading arms was also demolished in
separate incidents during ship-berthing operations. As a result of the
Iraq-Iran conflict, the regular crude supply from Iraq had ceased and the
refinery closed. Thus there was no oil import/export activity at berth 3.
Supplementary Works
3.16      In the construction of the banana berth (Berth 5), and in the
design of the extension (Berth 6), an area on each berth was left unpaved
in order to allow the future construction of transit sheds. As the need
for transit sheds had decreased, and as the handling of containers was
becoming more important, it was agreed that these two areas should be paved
and financed from funds remaining in the IDA Credit. However, at a later
date a decision was made to defer the paving until such time as the effect
of settlement was known.
3.17      Handling of RO-RO vessels with stern ramps had been a problem as
the ships damaged the quays extensively and a RO-RO ramp was required. The
ramp was not included in the project as it did not appear that there would
be adequate funds available. In early 1982 it appeared financially



- 7 -
feasible and was recommended by the Association subject to DANIDA's
acceptance. The ramp was completed within the project.
3.18      Fendering of berth 6 was included in the project.  However, there
was no fendering on berth 5 and it was agreed that since there was
considerable wear and tear on ships and quay that the same fendering should
be added to berth 5. DANIDA agreed to provide the necessary financing and
the fendering was completed.
Costs
3,19      The revised (March 1981) and actual project costs are set out in
Table i. The revised project was estimated at US$13.0 million including
contingencies. When completed the actual cost was US$9.3 million, a
savings of US$3.7 million. The savings were mainly due to the reduced
utilization of the estimated price and physical contingencies of US$2.6
million and to the devaluation of the Somalia Shilling.
Financial Sources
3.20      Of the revised project cost of US$13.0 million, the foreign
component was US$9.6 million. Under a parallel financing arrangement the
foreign costs would be met by the IDA credit of US$5.5 million and Loan of
about US$4.1 million from the Government of Denmark through the Danish
International Development Agency (DANIDA). The Government of Somalia was
to meet all local costs. The financing plan for the revised project is
shown below:

Performance of Consultants and Contractor
3.21      The consultants' design concept for the tanker berth seemed to
have been rather poor and this was demonstrated partly by the lower tenders
received for alternative designs from contractors. The borrower did
express the opinion that the original concept of a tanker terminal was
overdesigned which necessitated a subsequent revision of the cost estiLates
(para. 3.01) and which partially accounted for the high bids for
construction. The contractors' performance was good.
Disbursements
3.22      The cumulative disbursements are given in Table 2.  Disbursements
were originally delayed due to the change in the design of the project.
When the revised project became effective in March 1981 disbursements
followed the revised estimates closely until the end of FY83 when 91% of



- 8 -
the estimated amount was disbursed. However, the remaining disbursements
were slow with the final payment being made over one year later in July
1984.
IV. Operating Performance
4.01      The throughput for the Port of Mogadishu and for the Somalia
Ports Authority (SPA) in total fell below the appraisal estimate primarily
due to import and export of petroleum products not meeting targets. As
originally designed the project was to construct a tanker terminal facility
to expedite the flow of petroleum products to and from the new refinery at
Mogadishu. While the refinery was completed external factors prevented it
from operating at the expected capacity. As a result, the imports fell
well below projections which in turn restricted the export of refined
products. In retrospect it was fortunate that the original objective of a
tanker terminal was dropped. Details are given in Tables 3 and 4.
4.02      Export traffic through Mogadishu, other than petroleum, equalled
or exceeded forecasts in all years except 1984, but exports for the three
ports in total did not meet expectations. In the early years imports were
close to targets but declined thereafter in total although in 1984
Mogadishu slightly exceeded appraisal forecast.
4.03      It is difficult to assess the operating performance as reliable
statistics are not available.
V. Financial Performance
5.01      Operating results are given in Table 5.  A comparison with
appraisal forecasts is not shown due to the change in the nature and design
of the project. Both the revenues and the operating surplus increased
annually. Revenues increased at a greater rate than expenses from 1978
through 1982, with the exception of 1981, due to increased port
throughput. During this period revenues increased 65% while working
expenses increased by only 33%. Tariffs were increased in 1983 which
compensated for the decline in tonnage throughput for that year. The large
increase in profitability in 1984 resulted from a 23% increase in tonnage
together with the 1983 tariff increase. The operating ratio is
considerably better than forecast in all years. Net income after
depreciation increased annually each year except 1981 when it fell due to
the drop in throughput and the increase in provision for depreciation
resulting from new assets being brought into service. However, SPA
experienced difficulties in obtaining foreign exchange needed to maintain
its fleet of equipment and to this extent operating expenses were
artificially depressed. Measures are being taken in the proposed Fifth
Port Project to ensure that SPA will have access to sufficient foreign
exchange to enable it to maintain its equipment and other assets properly.
5.02      Balance sheets are set out in Table 6.  As the SPA followed the
practice of actually paying a 'dividend' to the Government each year equal
to 80% of the profits this amount is shown as a current liability. Despite
this the current ratio has improved from 1.5 in 1979 to 1.9 in 1984. The
return on net fixed assets in use varies from 16.9% (1979) to 48.2%
(1984). However, the value of fixed assets was based on the asset
revaluation undertaken in 1978 and if the consultants' revaluation
undertaken in December 1984 which gave a net book value of fixed assets of
So. Sh. 4,902 million and depreciation of So. Sh. 174 million was applied,



- 9 -
the return on net fixed assets is practically nil in 1984. This
unfavourable rate of return reflects the fact that port charges have not
been adequately adjusted for inflation. This problem is now being
partially addressed by denominating shipside charges in U.S. Dollars with
effect from January 1985. In addition, under the proposed Fifth Port
Project, the Bank will seek to ensure that both U.S. Dollar and local
currency denominated tariffs are revised annually. The appraisal estimates
for the return on net fixed assets ranged from 5% to 7%.
5.03      A cash f'ow statement is given in Table 7.  Despite heavy capital
investments during the early years and dividends to the Government equal to
80% of the profits the cash position has increased from So.Sh.27.5 million
in 1980 to So.Sh.157.2 million in 1984.
VI. Institutional Development
6.01      SPA was required to appoint a port management expert for a period
of two years to advise and assist in the implementation of certain
recommendations made by consultants under the previous Credit 359-SO. The
recommendations covered operations and operational planning; tariffs;
financial and management accounting; cost accounting; and revaluation of
fixed assets. A management expert was employed from January 1979-January
1981. The assets were revalued effective January 1, 1978 and tariffs were
revised effective December 1977. A further tariff increase was implemented
in 1983.
6.02      Progress has been made in the area of financial accounting but
the costing system as recommended by the consultants has yet to be
completely implemented. SPA suffers from a shortage of qualified
accounting staff, a condition prevalent in Somalia.
6.03      Operational statistics are not adequate to properly assess port
operations nor for management decision-making.
6.04      Institutional development under the Fourth Port Project was
reviewed with the borrower and it was agreed that very little progress had
been made. The deficiencies will be addressed in the proposed Fifth Port
Project.
VII. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
7.01      The project as revised consisted primarily of the construction of
a new berth 6 and the modification and relocation of the existing oil
handling equipment and firefighting towers at berth 3. The benefits
anticipated from the project were the expected reduction in ship-waiting
time. In 1979 the waiting time averaged 3.3 days per ship. The project
was completed during the latter part of 1983, and 1984 was the first full
year of operations. The average waiting time in 1984 was 2.9 days.
7.02      The appraisal assumed that at least 50% of the savings in the
cost of ship-waiting time would be passed on to Somali exporters and
importers by reduced cargo rates and port congestion surcharges. Traffic
was projected to increase at a marginal rate of about 2% per annum but for



- 10 -
the purpose of the re-evaluation .tonnage is held constant at the 1984
level. The maintenance cost for berth 6 was calculated by allocating total
maintenance costs evenly to each berth and converting to US dollars using
the 1983 exchange rate of US$ - So. Sh. 17.556. This results in a
maintenance cost of US$ 56,000 per year. Using the actual throughput for
1984 the ship service time without the project (4 working berths) would
have amounted to 3,283 days and with the project (5 working berths) 1,715
days. The benefit realized in total ship service time thus amounts to
1,568 days per year. The cost per day of the average ship using the port
of Mogadishu is estimated at US$ 7,000 which results in an annual saving of
US$ 10,976,000 of which 50% is assumed to be passed on to Somalia.
Adjusting capital costs to 1984 value, the economic rate of return so
calculated is 34% over a 25 year life which compares favorably with the
revised projected rate of return of 21%. The favorable economic rate of
return is partly contributed by the lower investment cost as a result of
actual contract price (US$ 9.3 million) being lower than the estimated
costs (US$ 13.0 million) and an upward revision of the value of ship
waiting time from US$ 6,600 at appraisal to US$ 7,000 to reflect the
changing composition of vessels calling at Mogadishu in 1984. The
following table summarizes the calculation.
Costs ($'000)

1984                          56               5,488
1985-2008                     56               5,A88
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The legal document contains a number of covenants covering
management, tariffs, capital investments, debt limitation, training
program, operational targets and audits. The borrower has complied with
all but two of these covenants. The SPA was to prepare a suitable training
program not later than June 1, 1979. This was not done and will require
technical assistance which is being provided under the proposed Fifth Port
Project which will pay special attention to training. During negotiations
it was agreed that certain operational targets should be met. It is not
possible to determine if these objectives are being met due to the
unreliable statistics presently being prepared. This problem is also being
addressed under the proposed project.
8.02      FinanLially SPA showed much better results than were projected.
A 63% increase in tonnage throughput between 1978 and 1984 coupled with a
tariff increase in 1983 resulted in high profits, high liquidity and the
ability to pay dividends to the Government.



- 11 -
Performece of the Association and Lessons Learned
8.03      The borrower expressed satisfaction with the advice and
assistan e given by the supervision missions but felt the missions should
have been more frequent, possibly every three months. The borrower also
felt that there should not have been so many Bank staff changes, in
particular with the engineers.
8.04      The Fourth Port Project was initially designed to supply a tanker
berth for the import of crude oil to be refined in Somalia, and the export
of refined petroleum products not consumed within the country. The design
was completed before appraisal. When bids were received for construction
the lowest bid was approximately three times the appraisal estimate. This
reinforces the conclusion already recognized that bids for civil works on
port projects should be received before Board presentation.
8.05      The project as revised was successfully completed.  The expected
completion date was June 30, 1983. The provisional certificate was given
on July 10, 1983 and minor works were completed shortly thereafter.
Although not technically finished the berth was in actual use during the
latter part of 1983. The final costs were below the estimates. The
foreign component which had been estimated at US$ 9.6 million was completed
for US$ 8.3 million. This reduction was partially due to exchange rate
fluctuations. Local costs in terms of Somalia Shillings were substantially
below the revised estimated costs with actual being SoSh 8.8 million
compared with an estimate of SoSh 21.4 million.
8.06      During early construction of the new berth it became apparent
that traffic with Ro-Ro ships was increasing and berthing of these ships at
the Psisting quays was unsatisfactory due to heavy damage to the quay
aprons by the ships ramps. The consultants prepared plans for various
locations of a Ro-Ro ramp during August and September 1981. However due to
a shortage of funds at the time it was decided to adopt the least cost
solution of establishing the ramp at the outer corner of berth 6. This
location cannot be considered as a permanent solution as berthing at the
ramp can be difficult during the northeast monsoon (November to March).
The additional cost of the Ro-Ro ramp, however, was insignificant as it
amounted to only $3,500.
8.07      During the course of project supervision, subsidence problems
were noted on the breakwater which had been financed under the Second and
Third Port Projects (Cr. 359-SO and Cr. 586-S0). After attempting to
resolve this through maintenance repairs, it has been decided to remedy the
problem under the proposed Fifth Port Project.
