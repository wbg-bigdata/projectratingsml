MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIAfION
TO THE EXECUTI'IE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR THE GUANGDONG AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed development credit for SDR 121.7 million (US$162
million equivalent) to the People's Republic of China to help finance a
Guangdong Agricultural Development Project.  The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity. Proceeds of the IDA credit would
be onlent to Guangdong Province on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA,
which would include interest at a rate of 6%, with repayment over 15 years,
including five years of grace. The foreign exchange risk would be borne by
Guangdong. On-lending rates to final beneficiaries would be no less than
Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) charges for subloans for similar purposes
with similar maturities.
2.          Background.  Agriculture in China, including crops, livestock,
forestry and fisheries, provides sustenance for over 1.1 billion people; it is
an important source of income for some 190 million farm families and accounts
for about 30% of the country's GDP. Only about 137 million ha (14%) of
China's land area of 960 million ha are arable. Farming systems are intensive
with heavy inputs of labor, chemical and organic fertilizers and small
machinery. Nearly half of the cropped area is irrigated. Foodgrains occupy
about 70% of total cropland and account for about one-third of the
agricultural output. Intensive farming has allowed China to meet the basic
food requirements of its population, about 22% of the world's total, and to
produce an increasingly sophisticated mix of cash and commercial crops from
less than 11% of the world's arable land. China's decade-long rural reform
program has revitalized the agricultural sector, provided impressive growth
and structural changes through the introduction of the production
responsibility system, increased producer prices and enlarged the role of the
market. The gross value of agricultural output increased by 83% in real terms
during 1978-88 at an average annual rate of 5%, substantially more than that
of the previous 25-year period (3.2% p.a.).
3.          The Government's long-term objectives for the agricultaral sector
are to increase food production to meet the requirements created by population
and income growth, and raise incomes and employment opportunities in rural
areas. Given China's shortage of arable land (0.1 ha per capita), development
planners have focussed on the need to increase the productivity of presently
cropped areas and to develop efficiently the few remaining areas of unutilized
land. Per capita and total value added in the crop subsector are to be raised
primarily by increasing the yield and quality of food, feed, orchard, and
industrial crops and also by increasing the volume of agroprocessing.
Although investment in agriculture declined markedly during the initial
reforms of 1980-85, it has since rebounded at all levels due to firm national
and provincial commitment to increasing production.



4.          Lessons Learned from Prevyous IDA Operations.  Bank assistance to
China's agriculture has supported the reform process, especially those aspects
ai.med at improving productivity, increasing productive off-farm employment in
rural areas, promoting export orientation and increasing reliance on markets.
Lending to date to China's agricultural sector has included 28 operations
involving a total assistance of about US$3.3 billion, covering a wide spectrum
of geographic areas and subsectors. Implementation of most of these projects
is both on schedule and satisfactory. Six Bank Group-financed agricultural
projects in China have recently been completed - North China Plain Agriculture
(Cr. 1261-CHA), Heilongjiang Land Reclamation (Cr. 1347/Ln. 2261-CHA), Rural
Credit (Cr. 1462-CHA), Seeds (Cr. 1577-CHA), Rubber Development (Cr. 1417-CHA)
and Rural Sector Adjustment Loan (Cr. 1932/Ln. 2967-CRA). The Project
Completion Reports indicate that project implementation was successful and
that economic rates of return were excellent. They stress the importance of
competent project management, regular maintenance of equipment and machinery,
and provision of post-harvest and marketing facilities. Supervision of on-
going projects, such as the Coastal Lands Development Project (Ln./Cr
2924/1887-CHA) and the Rubber Development Project (Cr. 1417/SF-5-CHA), has
shown that strict standards of management should be imposed on commercial
entities to ensure prompt start-up, high quality output and financially viable
operations. Taking these lessons into account, the proposed project
emphasizes the role of management and the selection of technology appropriate
to the technical and managerial skills available. An IFAD-financed Guangdong
Integrated Freshwater Fish Farming Project, for which the Bank is
administrator, is being carried out successfully; still, based on experience
under that project, modifications in pond design have been introduced in the
proposed project to expand the potential for development of aquaculture.
5.          Rationale for IDA Involvement.  As part of the Government's
efforts toward decentralization, this project has been planned and would be
implemented by the provincial, municipal and county governments. The proposed
project assists the Guangdong provincial government to: reinforce the
foundations for modernization already in place; improve the capacity for
planning, management, research and analytical work; and adopt new technologies
for further modernization. Furthermore, it would be IDA's first opportunity
to become involved in China's offshore fisheries and resource management.
IDA's contribution, in addition to overall project design and finance, has
been to establish the adequacy of offshore marine resources and to make
recommendations for the improvement of fishing vessel design and fishing gear,
fishery resource management, environmental protection, sea dike safety and
international marketing strategies.
6.          Project Objectives.  The objectives of the proposed project are
to: incr,L se fish production in the 100 m to 250 m depth of the northern
continental shelf of the South China Sea, thereby relieving pressure on near-
coastal resources; develop agriculturally-unsuitable land and mud flats and
shallow water areas along the coast for aquaculture; increase production of
fruits on sloping land; bring new land into agricultural production and
improve river flow conditions in the Pearl River delta; provide modern
agroindustrial facilities for handling and processing in order to improve the
quality and quantity of domestically marketed and exported agricultural
products; and address poverty in the limestone mountain area of the province.

7.          Project Description.  The project, to be carried out over six
years between late 1991 and December 1997, provides funds for: procurement of
86 fishing vessels; construction of about 4,000 ha of ponds and 11,000 cages
for aquaculture; improvement or establishment of about 14,000 ha -f orchards
on hilly lands; land reclamation works for improvement and expansion of 6,500
ha of sugarcane; establishment of agroprocessing facilities to utilize locally
available raw materials; and development and implementation of a poverty
alleviation package comprising studies, infrastructure and development credits
for households and village groups in a recognized poverty area. The project
cost is estimated at US$303.8 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange cost
of US$116.3 million (38%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements,
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in China are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Maps are attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 9554 dated October 10, 1991 is being distributed
separately.
8.          Actions Agreed.  At negotiations, the following assurances were
obtained: (a) Marine fisheries: (i) an annual marine resource survey would be
carried out and the survey results would be used to prepare a fisheries
resource assessment; (ii) on the basis of the survey, resource assessment, and
log book monitoring program, a Fisheries Management Plan would be prepared and
furnished to IDA; (iii) phasing of procurement, after the first procurement of
46 vessels, would be contingent on IDA's approval, on the basis of resource
assessments and the proven financial viability of previously procured vessels
already in operation; (iv) under arrangements satisfactory to IDA, a vessel
retirement plan would be implemented and employment would be provided for
displaced crews; (v) ownership of fishing vessels would be transferred to the
fishermen who have contracted the boats and repaid the full investment cost;
(b) Agriculture and Aguaculture: a monitoring system would be instituted to
insure that raising of seadikes is carried out as soon as soil settlement has
occurred, and during implementation, the technical quality of construction, as
well as the adequacy of the monitoring procedures, would be examined and
evaluated periodically by independent authorities; (c) tgroindustry:
operational guidelines acceptable to IDA would apply to all newly established
agroindustrial enterprises and, to the extent possible, to existing ones,
including that enterprises would maintain a debt-equity ratio no greater than
5:1 at all times; (d) Limestone Mountain Poverty Alleviation: subloans under
the development credit component would be appraised and approved by a
*        financial intermediary acceptable to IDA, applying guidelines agreed by the
provincial Leading Group For Poor Areas Development and acceptable to IDA, and
made on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA, including interest equivalent
*        to prevailing ABC terms.  A condition of disbursement for the Limestone
Mountain Poverty Alleviation component would be acceptance by IDA of the
implementation program. Retroactive financing in the amount equivalent to
US$12.8 million would be made available for eligible expenditures after
January 31, 1991.
9.          Envirornental AsRects.  Pesticides to be provided under the
project would be approved by IDA, and Bank-group guidelines on storage,
handling, distribution and use would be followed. The Environmental Action



- 4 .
Plan, as agreed with IDA, would be implemented, and all project activities
wculd comply with the guidelines and regulations issued by the National
Environmental Protection Agency and the Guangdong Environmental Protection
Bureau, acceptable to IDA.
10.         Bene£its.  The major benefits of the project would be increases in
production, rural incomes and employment, and improvements in marketing and
enterprise management. The marine fishery component has two important
features: the development of a fisheries management plan to help insure the
sustainability of the off-shore fishing industry before resources of the South
China Sea are seriously endangered; and privatization of most of the fishing
vessels after the investment cost has been recovered. The project would bring
into productive agricultural use some 3,280 ha of hilly land previously idle
and about 3,440 ha reclaimed from the Pearl River, in addition to increasing
the productivity of 10,700 ha of hilly land and 3,000 ha of previously
reclaimed land. Also, the project would develop some 4,000 ha of fish ponds
on low-lying land unsuitable for agriculture. At full development, the annual
incremental net value of production would be US$102.3 million. The project:
would directly improve living standards and income levels for some 72,000
households and would generate about 7.2 million incremental workdays,
equivalent to 24,000 full time jobs. The importance of women's role in
agriculture is being recognized by increasing employment of women farm
technicians and providing additional training opportunities; 20% of farm
technicians and 50% of farmer trainess would be women.
11.         Risks.   The project faces no unusual technical or organizational
risks. Project management would be strengthened under the project. The main
components have a long history of cultivation and operation, and farmers and
fishermen already have experience and basic knowledge. The potential
marketing risk for the fruit component would be alleviated through provision
of technical assistance to develop improved packaging and handling procedures.
The risk of overfishing and subsequent resource depletion of marine fisheries
would be reduced by developing a fisheries management plan and by phasing the
procurement of vessels. Where technical risk has been identified in the
agroindustry component, consultants would be engaged for review of designs and
on-site management training, and investments would be made in a two-phase
program, with the second phase conditional on achieving profitable operation
and full capacity utilization.
12.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed development
credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and
recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
