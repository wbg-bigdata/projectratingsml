MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR THE BRI/KUPEDES SMALL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to Indonesia for US$101.5
million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would have a term of
20 years, including five years of grace, at the standard variable interest
rate and would help finance a BRI/UPEDES small credit project. The proceeds
of the loan would be made available by the Government of Indonesia (GOI) to
Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) for a term of 20 years, including five years of
grace, at a variable interest rate which reflects the ongoing cost of 8RI's
rupiah customers deposits. GOI would carry the foreign exchange risk.
2.        Background.  Compared to its neighbors', the financial system of
Indonesia is still in an early stage of development. It has improved
substantially, however, since Government took major liberalization measures in
June 1983. Interest rates were then freed on deposits and nongovernment-
supported loans; credit ceilings were removed; and the volume of Government-
financed programs was reduced. These reforms had a substantial effect on the
banking system. Deposit and lending rates of State Banks increased sharply.
There was a rapid rise in deposits, particularly time deposits, but with a
Ahort maturity, limiting the availability of term loans. Private banks also
increased their share of bank credit and an active money market emerged.
Financial services outside the main metropolitan areas, and particularly those
for small credit and small savings, are provided by a large variety of formal,
semiformal and informal intermediaries. The largest single nationwide program
at the lowest Level of loan size is the KUPEDES program of BRI which is the
second largest bank and the most important source of credit for the rural and
small-scale enterprise sectors in Indonesia. The KUPEDES program was
initiated in 1984 as part of the thrust (brought about by the financial sector
reforms of 1983) to reduce credit subsidies. It operates exclusively through
the subdistrict-based Unit Desas (village sub-branches) of BRI which had been
originally established in 1970/71 to administer credit related to the rice
crop intensification program (BrIMAS - now abolished). Until the introduction
of KUPEDES, the Unit Desas had relied on a Goverment subsidy to cover their
operating costs and most of the loan losses. The objectives of BRI in intro-
ducing the KUPEDES credit program were to enable the Unit Desas to provide
credit and mobilize savings at market rates, and make a profit. KUPEDES loans
are available to all small creditworthy borrowers and 81 also actively
promotes savings mobilixation by the Unit Desas. At present, about 10Z of
KUPEDES loans are funded through liquidity credits from Bank Indonesia (BI).
The remaining 301 comes from the Unit Desas' savings mobilization efforts.
The interest rate to BRI on BI liquidity credits to fund KUPEDES loans is
121. BRI passes these funds on to the Unit Desas at an internal transfer rate
of 17? for working capital loans and 5Z for investment loans compared to the
9-15X rate paid by Unit Desas on customer deposits. Effective rates to final
borrowers (whose current use of KUPEDES loans is heavily for working capital)
range from 21.51 on investment loans (up to three years) to 31.71 on working
capital loans (up to two years). These are highly positive in real terms
(inflation in Indonesia in 1986 was about 9Z). The resulting spread is needed



I    - 2 -
to enable SRI to cover all the costs of delivering a large number of very
small loans in rural areas across Indonesia and still make a profit. Loan
amounts are between US$60 and US$1,200. The market for KUPEDES loans is
clearly defined and does not overlap with that of other Government supported
schemes.
3.        Project Objectives.  The project has the objectives of:  (a) promot-
ing BRI's efforts to develop the Unit Desa system into a financially viable
sub-branch network that is able to provide credit on a nonsubsidized basis to
all creditworthy small borrowers, to mobilize savings, and to provide other
banking services; (b) encouraging BRI to improve its resource mobAli:ation
efforts so that it could eventually fund KUPEDES loans out of the deposits it
raises; (c) providing long-term credit to BRI for KUPEDES lending so as to
reduce its reliance on SI liquidity credits; and (d) improving the overall
institutional capability of BRI, as it relates to the KUPEDES program, with
technical assistance complementing a USAID technical assistance package (US$10
million) recently approved for that purpose.
4.        Project Description.  The project would comprise the following two
components:
(a) A credit component for general purpose financing in all sectors. A
total of US$100.0 million of the proposed Bank loan is expected to
meet all BRI's projected external funding requirements for at least
the next three years of the KUPEDES program. Funds out of this
component would be disbursed on the basis of 10% of new KUPEDES loan
approvals (up to 65Z of the total increment in the KUPEDES loan
portfolio outstanding during the first year of the project and 60X
in subsequent years), or alternatively, 50% of the increment in the
KUPEDES loan portfolio outstanding, whichever is higher. Disburse-
ments would be on the basis of SOEs from BRU on the level of
approvals or outstandings, whichever is applicable.
(b) A technical assistance component, in which US$1.5 million of the
proposed Bank loan would complement an ongoing USAID financed
technical assistance program and would enable BRI to: (i) develop
its capacity to design, implement and analyze studies for monitoring
and evaluating the lending and savings activities of the Unit Desas;
and (ii) improve the capability of BRI's field auditors and
supervisory staff for Unit Desa operations.
5.        Based on current rates, the on-lending arrangements referred to in
para. 1 above would result in an onlending rate of about 11, or about 3%
above the current Bank rate. The project would be carried out over five
years. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. Retroactive financing (up to US$10 million)
would be allowed for expenditures in the quarter in which the loan agreement
is signed. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D, respec-
tively. A map, No. 11038R1, is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 6579-IND dated April 7, 1987, is also being distributed.

6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The KUPEDES program represents a
dramatic departure from the heavily subsidized credit programs that have
characterized much of the directed lending in Indonesia. Its success would
have a strong demonstration effect vis-a-vis existing priority credit schemes
and could lead to changes, long advocated by the Bank, aimed at reducing the
subsidy cost of these schemes. Also, for the first time in such a project,
resource mobilization is a specific and important objective. The numerous
credit Pthemes currently available in the rural and semi-urban areas in
Indonesia are being studied under a rural credit sector study in order to
determine how best these can be rationalized and made more effective. In the
interim, the project would allow the Bank to express its strong support for a
small credit scheme oriented towards the lower economic level of society,
within the context of a financially viable operation.
7.        Previous Bank Group Lenjing to the Sector.  To date, the Bank Group
has provided a total of US$837.6 million through thirteen operations with
financial intermediaries. The success in meeting the objectives of the Bank's
lending operations in the sector have been mixed. As shown in the two PPARs
(Nos. 2563-ID and 6403-1ND) dealing with the first five operations with
BAPINDO (the Development Bank of Indonesia), there has been considerable
improvement in some areas of its operations but it remains a weak institution
that continues to face serious problems. These are now being addressed with
substantial Bank assistance. The first two Small Enterprise Development
Projects (SEDP I and II - Cr. 785-IND and Ln. 2011-IND) have been completed
and a project completion report on their achievements is being compiled. SEDP
III (Ln. 2430-IND) will be completed by year-end 1987. These projects appear
to have had a positive impact on employment and income distribution. Their
costs have been very high, however, largely due to a substantial subsidy
element. The lessons learned from these operations will be helpful to the
Bank's future involvement in the sector including the proposed project. Thus,
under the proposed project, funds would be onlent at market rates. In
addition, measures to improve organization and management, as well as to
maintain sound portfolio quality, would put the intermediary in a position to
earn a profit. Also, there is no targetting of borrowers which could distort
the basis for credit decisions.
8.        Agreed Actions.  In order to achieve project objectives, it was
confirmed at negotiations that: (a) modification of the interest rate struc-
ture for KUPEDES loans to final borrowers would only be done after consul-
tation with the Bank; (b) BRI would furnish to the Bank by March 31, 1988, a
study relating to the identification of measures that may be needed to induce
greater demand for KUPEDES loans for investment purposes, and by June 30,
1988, a time-bound plan of action based on the study. BEI would thereafter
implement this plan; (c) no further liquidity credits from BI would be made
available as long as there remained undisbursed funds under the credit compo-
nent of the proposed Bank loan and any drawdowns of additional BI liquidity
credit between March 1, 1987, and loan effectiveness would be repaid over a
period of one year or less; (d) the agreement between BRI and BI concerning
the repayment by BRI of liquidity credits outstanding as of March 1, 1987,
would not be changed without the Bank's agreement; (e) BRI would allocate to
the Unit Desa Development Fund at least 5OZ of the margin between the cost to
itself of the Bank loan proceeds and the onlending rate to the Unit Desas; (f)



-4-
BRI would employ by October 31, 1987, an advisor in surveying techniques and
methodology for strengthening its Research and Planning Division; (g) should
arrears of one day or more exceed 8Z of the KUPEDES loan portfolio over a six-
month period, BRI would, within three months, submit to the Bank information
relating to actions taken and its action plan to reduce such arrears; and
(h) BRI would incorporate into its Unit Desa Strategy Statement a clause
stating that maintaining a sound portfolio quality would receive management's
highest priority and that arrears of three months or more past final install-
ment due date of 62 or more would be considered unsatisfactory performance.
Should this level be reached, BRI management would evaluate the overall pro-
grams and organization of the Unit Desas with a view to redesigning ongoing
programs, organization and procedures to ensure the continued financial
viability of the Unit Desa system on an autonomous basis.
9.        The following would be conditions of loan effectiveness: (a) adop-
tion of the agreed Unit Desa Policy Statement and Unit Desa Strategy Statement
by BRI's Board of Managing Directors (these statements would not be amended
without prior agreement of the Bank); and (b) the signing of a subsidiary loan
agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, between GOI and BRI.
10.       Project Justification and Risks.  The KUPEDES program is a major
source of financial services for small-scale activities in mostly rural areas
where access to financial institutions, and especially credit, is still inade-
quate. Funds, lent at highly positive interest rates, would be used for acLi-
vities with acceptable economic returns and would promote rural development.
The risks are two-fold: (a) portfolio deterioration, particularly as the pro-
gram expands, and (b) bureaucratization of the credit process if it moves from
simple procedures that do not target specific borrowers to more intricate
application procedures and specific lending targets. This could distort the
basis of lending decisions and stifle the program. Recognizing both risks,
BRI's management is developing a progrem for training staff, improving
internal controls and incentives, and monitoring program performance. The
project provides support to BRI's policy to operate the Onit Desas as auto-
nomous profit oriented sub-branches that no longer participate in highly sub-
sidized administered credit schemes. The project's design also takes account
of the above risks. Given these efforts and GOIts commitment to developing a
more open financial system, the potential benefits of this project outweigh
the risks.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
