PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PHILIPPINES
SMALL FARMER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1646-PH)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Small Farmer
Development Project in the Philippines, for which Loan 1646-PH in the amount of
US$16.5 million was approved on December 21, 1978.  The loan was closed on
June 30, 1985 after two extensions of one year each. An undisbursed balance of
US$835,244.49 was canceled.
Parts I and III of the PCR were prepared by the East Asia and Pacific
Regional Office; Part II includes comments on Parts I and III provided by the
Land Bank of the Philippines, the main executing agency for the project. The PCR
is based, inter alia, on the findings of an FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program
completion mission which  visited the Philippines in late 1988; the Staff
Appraisal Report; the Loan and Project Agreements; Supervision Reports;
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower or LBP; and internal Bank
memoranda. The Bank wishes to thank the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program, the
Land Bank of the Philippines and other agencies of the Philippines Government for
their assistance in preparing this PCR.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PHILIPPINES
SMALL FARMER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1646-PH)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
1.        The main objective of the Small Farmer Development Project was to
increase rural incomes by enhancing agricultural productivity and expanding rural
employment opportunities among smallscale farmers, most of whom were
beneficiaries of Government's agrarian reform program. This was to be achieved
through the coordinated delivery of technical assistance, improved infrastructure
and the provision of credit by che Land Bank of the Philippines  (LBP) to
beneficiaries in land reform areas. Assistance was also to be provided to LBP
to improve the performance of its field support services. Total project costs
were estimated at US$37 million, against which a Bank loan of US$16.5 million was
provided.  It was expected that the three-year project would be completed by
June 30, 1982, and the loan would be closed on June 30, 1983.
Implementation Experience
2.        A number of problems became apparent soon after project start-up.  LBP
began to face a series of issues which had their origin in the inherent conflict
between its mandate to operate as a banking institution and its social
responsibilities as an agent of the Government's agrarian reform program.
Management of th_ Integrated Estate Development Programs (IEDPs) was not entirely
successful, mainly due to limited technical expertise.  Although a national
Committee on Infrastructure Development in Agrarian Reform Areas (CIDARE) was
formed, coordination and monitoring of infrastructure works remained poor. The
project was completed in June 1985, about three years behind schedule.
3.        Credit Component.  Bank loan disbursements were slower than expected
for term credit, with only about 70 parcent of the targeted amount disbursed by
the end of the original three year implementation period. The main constraints
were the poor credit standing of the agrarian reform beneficiaries (ARBs) and
slow progress in expanding LBP's field services. However, by the end of the
project, total term credit disbursement (F367 million) was broadly in line with
appraisal expectations (F360 million in 1985 prices), and seasonal credit (not
included for Bank reimbursement at appraisal) of P135 million in 1985 exceeded
the appraisal target of P124 million (in 1985 prices). At project completion,
term credit was only 38 percent of total project costs (54 percent expected at
appraisal) and seasonal credit 46 percent (24 percent expected at appraisal).



- iv -
Only 7,000 'n- s (or 5.5 percent of the total 127,000 loans made under the
project) wer-    r term credit.
4.        Init.-ally, LBP concentrated on providing credit to priority target
groups, that is, ARBs, but to overcome slow credit delivery LBP increasingly
promoted lending to second priority borrowers, including farmer groups, for
integrated livestock projects, fish farwing and sugarcane development.  These
sub-projects were not generally successful and many were discontinued when the
anticipated benefits did not materiali2e.
5.        LBP's collection performance on term loans was poor at 43 percent; the
arrears ratio (past due loans to amount due) was as high as 60 percent. Although
precise figures were not available, it was estimated that about 70 percent of the
loans granted by LBP's field offices were more than three years overdue. Short
term credit collection was comparatively better at 62 percent.   Collection
performance problems reflected the cumulative impact of inadequste professional
field staff, poor supervision and appraisal standard, and the deteriorating
economic conditions prevailing during the early 1980.. The latter was probably
a substantial reason for the poor collection rate. The sub-borrowers' perception
that land amortization loans were Government grants also carried over, affecting
attitudes towards repayment of other categories of LBP's loans.  A limiting
factor was the inability (by law) of LBP to impose sanctions against the security
of the land for recovery of loans.  LBP's net losses under the project were
approximately 15 percent of the outstanding loans during 1985. These losses were
covered by LBP's profits from its commercial credit and other banking activities.
6.        Minor Infrastructure. To improve production in IEDP areas, the project
was to support minor and scattered infrastructure works such as feeder roads,
irrigation canals, and flood control dikes. To oversee implementation, CIDARE
was set up at the national level, with counterpart executing committees (PICs)
at provincial level. The main constraints were the lack of authority given to
the CIDARE/PICs to control counterpart funds, poor inter-agency cooperation, and
lack of technical competence. Poor sub-component definition in the SAR caused
considerable confusion in the selection of sub-projects for Bank reimbursement.
This was resolved in 1981 when, by amendment to the project documents, it was
agreed that all sub-projects completed after January 1979 on landed estates could
be reimbursed. At project completion, 64 minor infrastructure projects had been
carried out. Some of these were of poor construction standard, raising doubts
about the extent and sustainability of the benefits of this project component.
7.        Field Support Services.   The requirements for LBP field support
services to facilitate the coordinated delivery of technical assistance to ARBs
were seriously underestimated at appraisal.   A total of about 50 Estate
Development Coordinations (EDCs) and a similar number of subordinate field staff
were to have been employed by the end of project implementation, with an EDC:
farmer ratio of 1:300. By the end of 1985, however, about 70 EDCs and 510 other
field staff had been employed with an EDC: farmer ratio of about 1:700. Only
about 64,000 farmers (50.4 percent of the 127,000 farmer borrowers) were visited
during 1985. Cooperation with and technical assistance provided by the staff of
the Ministry of Agriculture was below expectations, partly because of budgetary



- v -
constrainta.   The increase in LBE's field staff and the extended project
implementation period raised the costs of projbct serv.ces about five tim -s above
those expected at appraisal.
Proiect Re-sults
8.        Overall, the projoct was unsatisfactory.  Although most quantitative
targ te were met and some exceeded, due to a much longer implementation period
than envisaged at appraisal, the project impact in terms of production and farm
incomes has been much lower than expected. Available data are insufficient to
allow calculation of a project economic rate of return but they show that
investments in farm mechanization, post-harvest facilities, farm support and
development, and poultry (200 layers) yield very low or negative rates of return.
These investments accounted for over 50% of the term credit provided under the
p.oject. Data relating to the impact of the short-term credit on beneficiaries'
income are not available. The impact of the project on LBP's profitability was
negative. LBP's loan collection performance was unsatisfactory. The interest
rate of 12% on term loans was, on the average, negative in real terms due to
unexpectedly high inflation rates in 1984 and 1985.   The results of the
infrastructure component are also not very satisfactory (para. 6). However, the
project made a partial contribution to LBP's institutional strengthening. This
was the first Bank loan to LBP and it assisted LBP in strengthening its rural
banking operations.
Sustainabilitv
9.        Overall, the sustainability of the project, particularly that of the
term credit and support services for agrarian reform beneficiaries provided under
the project, is, at best, uncertain.  However, the project has facilitated a
sustainable LBP presence in the land reform areas which should be of increasing
value in the future. LBP's performance, particularly in agricultural lending,
has improved significantly during the late 1980s/early 1990s.
Findin2s and Lesson Learned
10.       The following are the main lessons to be drawn from implementing this
project:
(a)  specific criteria for selecting, evaluating, and supervising sub-
projects should be laid down to ensure the financing of viable
activities (PCR, para. 9.1);
(b)  continuous  training  of  field  staff  covering  sub-project
appraisal, borrowers' repayment capacity and cash-flow, loan
administration and collections is required (PCR, para 9.1);
(c)  a stronger market research on agricultural investment and an
improved management information system are important elements for
ensuring project success (PCR para 9.1); and



- vi -
(d)  interest rate for agricultural lending should be adjusted to
better reflect market rates and to fully cover costs and margins
(PCR, para 9.1).

2. Background
2.1       General.   In 1977, at the time of project appraisal, agriculture
accounted for about half of total employment and over 50 percent of foreign
exchange earnings  in the Philippines.   Three-qurters  of the land under
cultivation was devoted to grain production, mainly rice and corn. About 70
percent of the population (total 42.5 million in 1977) lived in rural areas, with
60  percent  depending  directly  on agriculture.    Structurally,  Philippine
agriculture was dominated by small-scale farmers with a national average land
holding of about 3.6 ha. Prior to the land reform initiated in the early 1970s,
a large proportion of rice and corn farmers had worked as sharecroppers on
privately owned estates.   Most arable lands had already been brought under
cultivation, making the Government's declared policy of sustained self-
sufficiency in food grains critically dependent on increased productivity of
already occupied lands. Improved technology for irrigated rice cultivation did
exist and was belng successfully introduced, but there was no comparable
technical base fo' pland crops, amongst which corn was the most important.
2.2       Land Tenure and Agrarian Reform.  About 30 percent of all farms were
operated by tenants, with a further 12 percent being lands under Government
ownership (1971 Agricultural census).   Landlords with cash rental or share-
cropping arrangements were the main providers of credit, inputs and, in certain
cases,  marketing  assistance.    In  1972,  aiming  to  promote  family-owned
smallholdings as the foundation of Philippine agriculture, GOP declared all
tenanted rice and corn farms as land reform areas, under Presidential Decree No.
27. Operation Land Transfer (OLT) was applicable to all farms ("Estates") above
7 ha and a Leasehold Enforcement Program applied to all those below 7 ha. The
Ministry of Agrarian Reform (MAR) was responsible for overall administration of
the program, and the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) was to handle the



financing of land acquiaition under OLT. After some initial progress, problems
associated with poor survey standards and an inadequate institutional framework
greatly slowed implementation of the agrarian reform.  Nonetheless, by March
1978, some 227,000 farmers, cultivating about 445,000 ha, had been issued
Certificates of Land Transfer (CLTs) and a smaller number (37,000) had already
signed Farmers' Undertakings, committing them to repay LBP the value of the lands
they had received. It was recognized that these farmers would require assistance
to enable them to become self-sufficient after severance from their former
landlords, upon whom they had depended for financing and a wide range of
services.
2.3       The Small Farmer Development Project (SFDP) was designed to address the
needs of low-income small farmers, particularly those participating under the
agrarian reform program. It was complementary to several other Bank efforts in
the Philippines in the mid-1970s, aimed at addressing the development needs of
small farmers. The project was appraised in 1;-06, and an agreement for a loan
of US$16.5 million was signed in January 1979. With a total estimated cost of
US$37 million, the project was to be implemented in three years, with project
completion planned for June 1982 and loan closing in June 1983. The loan became
effective in April 1979 and was actually closed in June 1985, after two
extensions of one year each.
3. Proiect Obiective and Description
3.1       The main objective of the project was to increase the incomes of
agrarian reform beneficiaries by improving farm productivity and generating of f-
farm employment activitiee.  This was to be achieved through the coordinated
delivery of technical assistance, improved infrastructure and the provision of
seasonal and term credit by LBP to beneficiaries in land reform areas.
Assistance was also to be provided to LBP to improve the performance of its field
support services. The project was national in scope, with a main concentration
in the rice growing lowlands of Central Luzo:. where proximity to existing or
proposed LBP offices in declared agrarian reform areas was an important
consideration in selecting beneficiaries.
3.2       Short-term credit was to be provided to meet the seasonal costs of
production, mainly for rice, corn and vegetables, and the marketing requirements
of Samahang Nayons (SN) and area marketing cooperatives. Medium-term credit was
to be provided for livestock and poultry, farm mechanization and post-harvest
facilities, as well as for the development of cottage industries. The World Bank
loan financed only medium-term credit, leaving the seasonal credit entirely to
the Government.   A second major component for infrastructure im2rovement in
selected project areas included construction of feeder roads, flood control and
communal irrigation.  Sub-components were to be executed by appropriate line
agencies, following approval of development plans by the national Committee on
Infrastructure Development in Agrarian Reform Areas (CIDARE), set up specifically
for the project. Funds were also to be provided for the strengthening of LBP
field offices and for socio-economic studies, including reviews of delivery
mechanisms and means of promoting farmer participation.  Of the total project
cost, 21 percent was allocated to seasonal credit, 49 percent to term credit, 15



-3
percent to infrastructure, 4 percent to LBP field support services and studies,
and the rest to physicel and price contingencies.
4. Prolect Detign -nd Organization
4.1       The project concept was based on the perceived needs of small farmers
who hLad entered into Farmers' Undertakings to repay loans to LBP for the purchase
of the lands they had previously tenanted.  It was designed to promote their
independence and to support the Government's policy of creating family-owned
smallholdings.   The implementation arrangements for the project appeared to
include all necessary institutions, with the proposed interaction of LBP, MAR and
CIDARE.
4.2       Due credit must be given to LBP for having developed a number of
innovative approaches to dealing with its agrarian reform mandate, including the
implementation of Integrated Estate Development Programs (IEDPs) and the setting
up of a subsidiary called Masaganang Sakaha Inc. (MSI) to finance and provide
support services to small farmers.   Unfortunately,  results were less than
satisfactory because of an overestimation of the capacity of LBP to expand field
operations quickly and simultaneously throughout the country and still maintain
adequate loan appraisal and collection standards; an unrealistically short
implementation period; and some technical assumptions which proved to be over-
optimistic in the absence of adequate extension services and replicable
technologies.   Another innovative effort was the financing of a warehousing
scheme to assist in crop marketing, whereby storage facilities were to be
provided against payment-in-kind (mainly palay) to amortize construction, with
organized farmer groups taking over and managing these warehouses.  However,
apart from providing facilities for LBP field staff and drying floors for local
farmers, the scheme was not successful because farmers did not use the storage
facilities for fear of seizure against past due loans.
5. Proiect Implementation
5.1       General.   Soon after the initiation of project implementation, LBP
began to face a series of issues which had their origin in the inherent conflict
between its mandate to operate as a banking institution and its social
responsibilities as an agent of the Covernment's agrarian reform program.
Management of the IEDPs was not entirely successful, mainly due to limited
technical expertise. To help strengthen LBP, a number of local consultant groups
were employed to train its staff, carry out studies, develop community
organizations, and improve accounting procedures, with varying degrees of
success.    Although  CIDARE  was  formed,  coordination  and  monitoring  of
infrastructure works remained poor.
5.2       Two priority categories of borrowers were serviced under the project.
The first included agrarian reform beneficiaries and the second was other
farmers, including voluntary groupings involved mainly with integrated small
livestock projects, and medium-scale commercial entrepreneurs.

5.3       Credit Component.  Initial Bank loan disbursements for term credit,
which was the main component, were slow, with only about 70 percent of the
targeted amount disbursed by the end of the original three-year implementation
period, although final disbursements for term credit were broadly in line with
appraisal targets. The main difficulties were the poor credit standing of the
agrarian reform beneficiaries and slow progress in expanding LBP's field
services.  The total amount of short-term credit advanced by the end of the
project period substantially exceeded appraisal targets. For both seasonal and
term credit, there were significant deviations from the distribution envisaged
at appraisal (Table 1):

5.4       Interest Rate.   Under the project, loans to individual borrowers
carried an interest rate of 12% p.a. This rate was, at the time of appraisal,
comparable to rates charged on similar loans by other institutions in the
country. The loan proceeds were onlent to LBP at Bank's rate of 7.35% leaving
a spread of 4.65% to cover operating costs and expected loan losses. Foreign



exchange risk was assumed by the Government and no fee was charged against it.
Inflation rate at appraisal was expected to be 6.0 to 7.5% p.a. for various cost
items during the original project implementation period (1979-82), which made the
lending rate of 12% positive in real terms. However, project implementation was
extended for another three years, closing in mid 1985. The average inflation
rate over this period (1979-85) was 18% p.a., resulting in a neg4tive real
interest rate.
5.5       Minor Infrastructure.  This component addressed minor infrastructure
needs to improve production in IEDP areas. To oversee implementation, a policy
making inter-agency Committee (CIDARE) was set up at the national level, with
counterpart executing committees at provincial level (Provincial Infrastructure
Committees,  PICs).      Estate  Development  Coordinators  (EDCs)  identified
infrastructure needs in IEDP areas and line agency field officers undertook
feasibility studies. Works carried out included barangay roads and bridges, and
communal irrigation projects. Flood control measures planned at appraisal were
not undertaken. The main constraints were the lack of authority given to the
CIDARE/PICs to control counterpart funds, poor inter-agency cooperation and lack
of technical competence.   Poor subcomponent definition in the SAR caused
considerable confusion in the selection of subprojects for Bank reimbursement.
This was resolved in 1981 when, by amendment to the project documents, it was
agreed that all subprojects completed after January 1979 on landed estates could
be presented for reimbursement.
5.6       Field  Support  Services.   The  coordinated  delivery of  technical
assistance to beneficiaries of the agrarian reform program was to be a key
feature of project design. In 1981, through a "Memorandum of Agreement", the LBP
entered into an arrangement with the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and MAR to
create a Multi-Agency Coordinating Committee (MCC) to assist with implementation
of the IEDPs. The national MCC formulated policies and guidelines for provincial
MCCs, which supervised execution through Estate Management Groups (EMGs). These
groups included senior MOA representatives, the EDC (LBP), MOA technical
personnel and representatives of infrastructure agencies working in the agrarian
reform areas. After initial success, commitment waned and linkages weakened,
creating a heavy workload for the EDCs, particularly as cooperation between the
MOA technical bureaus and the EDCs was not successfully developed. LBP field
operations were improved by the recruitment of about 580 EDCs and other field
staff by 1985, but with an EDC to farmer ratio of about 1:660, this proved to be
inadequate to service loans and provide the necessary technical assistance.
6. Prolect Results
6.1       Credit.   Short-term credit was provided for farm inputs such as
fertilizer, crop protection chemicals, seed and hired labor, and to finance the
marketing needs of Samahang Nayons (SN) and cooperatives.   Term credit was
provided for individual and group activities, including backyard livestock
development (poultry and duck raising, cattle fattening/breeding and pig
raising), farm mechanization (hand tractors and power tillers), draft animals,
irrigation pumps, rice threshers and other post-harvest facilities. The total
number of loans made under the project is reported by LBP at about 127,000, of



-6-
which some 7,000 were  for term credit.   Of the latter,  agrarian reform
beneficiaries accounted for 93 percent (6,522), but received only P 87.6 million
or 50 percent of the total volume of term lending."' A large amount of term
credit (P86.7 million) was distributed to some 300 second priority borrowers, the
average size of their loan being about 20 times larger than that provided to
agrarian reform beneficiaries and other small-scale farmers.21 The distribution
of first and second priority borrowers is not available for seasonal credit,
which was not included for reimbursement by the Bank at appraisal.
6.2       Initially, LBP concentrated on providing credit to priority target
groups. However, at the end of the original three-year implementation period,
to boost credit delivery, which had been constrained by sizeable arrearages in
loans to agrarian reform farmers, LBP increasingly promoted lending to second
priority borrowers, including farmer groups, for integrated livestock projects,
fish farming and sugarcane development. These subprojects were not generally
successful, and many were discontinued when the anticipated benefits did not
materialize.
6.3       LBP's collection performance on term loans was poor at 43 percent (end-
1985); the past due and arrear ratios were as high as 40 percent and 60 percent
respectively (Table 2). Although precise figures were not available, it was
estimated that about 70 percent of loans granted by LBP's field offices were more
than three years  overdue.    Short-term credit  collection performance was
comparatively better at 62 percent. Collection performance problems reflected
the cumulative impact of inadequate field staff, weak collection strategies, poor
supervisior. and appraisal standards, and the deteriorating economic conditions
prevailing during the early 1980s. The last was probably a substantial reason
for  the  poor  collection  rate.    The  subborrowers'  perception  that  land
amortization loans were Government grants also carried over, affecting attitudes
towards repayment of other categories of LBP loans.   LBP could not proceed
against the security of land for the recovery of loans as, under Presidential
Decree No. 27, lands allotted to agrarian reform beneficiaries were not
alienable. LBP's net losses under the project were approximately 15 percent of
the outstanding loans during 1985. These losses were covered by LBP's profits
from its commercial credit and other banking business.
±1 No specific target was given in the SAR regarding the number of agrarian reform farmers who
were to benefit from the project - a total of 9,900 borrowers/subprojects were to be financed,
including "second priority" beneficiaries.
2/ This figure, however, includes farmer groups involving individual members, whose numbers are
not known.

6.4       Minor Infrastructure Develoipment.   Sixty-four minor infrastructure
subprojects were carried out at an actual cost of P 54.6 million, against SAR
estimates of t 38.9 million (1978 prices). The physical targets and achievements
are shown in Table 3 below:

Cumbersome procedures and Government budgetary problems, the latter particularly
acute during the early 1980s, created considerable difficulty in identifying and
implementing appropriate subprojects. Post-project review of some of the works
revealed poor construction standards, raising doubts about the extent and
sustainability of benefits attained.



-8-
6.5       Field Support Services.   The requirements for LBP field support
services were seriously underestimated at appraisal. A total of about 50 EDCs
for the IEDPs, and a similar number of subordinate field staff, were to hsve been
employed by the end of the three-year credit disbursement period. EDC:farmer
ratios were to be about 1:300 - 500. By the end of 1985 (Year 7), however, about
70 EDCs and 510 other field staff had been employed to service some 127,000
farmer borrowers with an EDC:farmer ratio in the IEDPs of about 1:660. This was
mainly because of the larger than expected volume of seasonal Credit, and smaller
average loan sizes, which translated into a significantly larger number of
borrowers. Only some 64,000 borrowers (50.4 percent) were visited during 1985,
by which time LBP staff preoccupation with loan collections had resulted in
limited attention being given to their technical assistance functions.
Cooperation with, and technical assistance provided by the staff of MOA, was
below expectations, also partly due to budgetary constraints. The eventually
increased levels of LBP staff and the extended project implementation period
raised the costs of project services about five times above those foreseen in the
SAR.
6.6         By the end of 1985, LBP had established 67 IEDP areas and 3,867
farmer groups, involving about 47,000 farmers, or 37 percent of the tot_l farmer
borrower coverage.   Fourteen warehouses had also been constructed for their
benefit.   There  is no  appropriate  data to measure  the  impact  of  these
interventions on farmer incomes and productivity.
6.7       To the extent that the project was seen by both the Bank and LBP as a
useful learning process for the latter, through which its institutional
objectives in land reform and rural development, financial policies and
organizational arrangements could be tested, it was relatively successful.
However, the viability of the credit program was an issue from the start, given
the nature and poor financial status of the intended project beneficiaries - a
problem which could never be fully overcome by LBP. The risks recognized at
appraisal - in particular LBP's limited experience in agricultural credit
generally and small farmer credit in particular - were expected to be overcome
by organizational measures, especially field level technical assistance.   In
retrospect, these were not sufficient and did not fully recognize the training
needs of LBP staff in agricultural loan appraisal and supervision, LBP's weak
information system, or the administrative environment and cumbersome budgetary
procedures.
6.£       Overall, the proJ4ct was unsatisfactory.  Although most quantitative
targets  were  met  and  some  exceeded,  due  to  the much  longer  period  of
implementation than envisaged at appraisal, the project impact in terms of
production and farm incomes has been much lower than expected.  The data base is
incomplete and, to a certain extent, not reliable, but the overall impression as
far as the term credit is concerned, which was the major project component at
appraisal, is clearly one of a large number of uneconomic activities financed
without adequate appraisal of obtainable yields, market prospects, technical and
other constraints (diseases, "sourcing" of animals for cattle development,
importation of poultry feed, and energy and fuel shortages during the economic
crisis faced by the country in 1984-85).   Many of these activities were



-9-
eventually discontinued by borrowers unable to repay their loans. Based on the
data collected and analysed by LBP (Part III, Section 6, and Annexes 2-4),
investments in farm mechanisation, post-harvest facilities, farm development and
support, and poultry (200 layers) yield very low or negative rates of return.
These investments accounted for over 50% of term credit provided under the
project.   On the other hand, the number of beneficiaries  (41,000 farmers,
cumulative) reported by LBP in the IEDP areas exceeds the appraisal estimates.
No estimate has been made of the impact of the very significant volume of short-
term credit on these beneficiaries' incomes or living standards.
7. Project Sustainabilitv
7.1       Overall,  the sustainability of the project, particularly that of
medium-term credit and support services for agrarian reform beneficiaries
provided under the project is, at best, uncertain. However, a major long-term
project aim was the institutional strengthening of LBP, particularly the
development of its field operations (involving, inter alia, the separation of
commercial operations at branch offices from small farmer activities related to
agrarian reform, the setting up of area offices, the employment of estate
development coordinators (EDC) and the expansion of the field office program).
These actions have laid the basis for a sustainable LBP presence in land reform
areas and should be of increasing value in the future. The results of these and
other efforts to strengthen LBP can clearly be observed, as LBP's performance,
particularly in agricultural lending, has improved significantly during the late
1980s/early 1990s.
8. Bank Performance
8.1       The project was prepared by LBP with the assistance of two Bank
missions in July/August 1977 and in February/March 1978, and an SAR was prepared
after a final Bank mission in May/June 1978. In spite of the considerable inputs
by both the Bank and LBP during project preparation, a number of design
w.aknesses  became  apparent  during  implementation.        In  retrospect,  an
insufficiently rigorous assessment of the institutional and staffing implications
of the project led to the adoption of an implementation period which was too
short to allow for the required growth in LBP's operations and staffing.
Continuity was maintained during supervision, with an experienced credit
specialist reviewing project implementation through 1984.   A close working
relationship was developed with LBP and discussions on perceived inadequacies in
project execution, loan arrearages and staffing shortages were frank and
constructive.
9. Borrower's Performance
9.1       This was the first Bank loan to the Philippines for LBP and its
borrowers, and it gave LBP the impetus to strengthen its internal organization,
procedures and staffing. It was also perceived by LBP as a vehicle for improving
the productivity of small farmers in agrarian reform areas, while at the same
time providing the necessary resources to assist in the reorientation of its
lending away from commercial clients. However, field staff build-up was slower



- 10 -
than projected, and LBP did not lay down clear and specific criteria for
selecting, evaluating and supervising sub-loans, which led to the financing of
non-viable activities. Staffing problems also contributed to unsatisfactory loan
collection performance. A further weakness was the inability of LBP's management
information system to provide up-to-date and detailed analysis of project
activities, as required for effective monitoring. LBP remained financially sound
throughout the project period, although the impact of project lending on its
profitability was negative.   The main lessons that LBP can draw from its
experience with the project include the need for better market research on
agricultural investments and an improved management information system; for
adjustment of agricultural interest rates to better reflect market rates and to
fully cover costs and margins; for continuous training of field staff, covering
loan administration and collections; and for better extension services at farm
level.
10. Project Relationships
10.1      LBP drew up memoranda of agreement with cooperating ministries and line
agencies to form two multi-agency coordinating bodies to oversee the two main
areas of project implementation outside of its own credit operations. These were
the MCC for estate development and CIDARE for infrastructure improvement in IEDP
areas.  Neither agreement achieved its full objective, and the participating
agencies were unwilling to fully commit staff and resources during a period when
the national budget was constrained and when each agency was faced with other
demands on its resources. The Bank and LBP maintained continued and good working
relations throughout, and after, the project period.
11.  Consultin, Services
11.1      A number of staff training and socio-economic research initiatives were
undertaken by LBP using national university and local consultant groups, with
varying degrees of success.   These were mainly concentrated on community
development and LBP institutional development. They were short-term measures,
however, and underscored the need for all agencies involved in agrarian reform
to enter into longer-term commitments to community development and staff
training.
12. Proiect Documentation and Data
12.1      No serious problems were encountered in complying with the project
legal agreements, although some difficulties did arise in two specific areas.
Monitoring of the loan portfolio was problematic due to the lack of an efficient
reporting system; and difficulties arose over the slow pace of staff deployment
which led to unsatisfactory sub-loan appraisal and collection performance. A
draft PCR was prepared by LBP staff but it concentrated on the Bank loan and not
on the project as a whole (thereby excluding analysis of seasonal credit
activities). With the long period between loan closure and PCR preparation, some
gaps were inevitable, but for the most part the data required for a project
completion report were available.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
On Interest Rate
1.        The interest rate charged by the LBP on the credit component of the
World Bank loan was based on prevailing market rates at that time. When the LBP
contracted the World Bank loan, it used the credit component to augment the
loanable funds under its existing lending program. Thus, it did not market the
World Bank loan as a special credit window with a special interest rate.
Instead, the proceeds of the World Bank loan were combined with the domestic
credit funds of the LBP. In fact, LBP had reimbursed from World Bank the actual
loan releases that it made under its regular lending program. Therefore, LBP
simply adopted the in;erest rate that it charged to its First Priority and Second
Priority clients as defined in its lending policy at that time.
2.        First Priority clients consisted of: (i) agrarian reform beneficiaries
who were holders of Emancipation Patents, Certificates of Land Transfer, etc. and
potential holders of any of the aforementioned certificates of ownership, each
of whom was to be a member of a Samahang Nayon (SN); (ii) small farmers who owned
not more than seven hectares of arable land; (iii) farmers' associations, SNs and
Cooperatives composed of a majority of members qualified under (i) and (ii) above
and registered with the appropriate regulatory agencies; and (iv) landowners/LBP
bondholders whose sub-projects would directly benefit individuals qualified under
the first two categories above.
3.        Second Priority clients were other borrowers whose sub-projects would
directly benefit individuals qualified under (i) and (ii) above.
4.        Before actual implementation of the project, LBP decided to exclude the
Short-Term (ST) production loans because it appeared that local fund sources were
cheaper than the World Bank loan. LBP could rediscount its ST credit with the
Central Bank (CB) at 1 percent p.a. (later increased to 3 percent p.a.) compared
to the 7.35 percent p.a. that it had to pay the World Bank. Therefore, it had
reimbursed from the World Bank only the medium term credit on which it charged
12 percent p.a. to First Priority clients and 13 - 15 percent p.a. to second
priority clients. An additional 2 percent p.a. service charge was added to the
loan.   Such rates were in line with market rates at that time.   Since LBP
loanable funds were sourced mainly from National Government equity and other
internally generated profits, these rates were considered reasonable with an
adequate margin for LBP. Besides, under the terms of the World Bank loan, LBP
was protected from foreign exchange risk since this was borne by the Government.
Assensment of Sub-proiects
5.        A complete manual of operations was prepared and approved by the LBP
management for the implementation of the World Bank loan. In fact, LBP adopted



- 12 -
the same procedures that it used for its regular First and Second Priority loans.
Factors consliered in the assessment of the sub-projects were:
(a) actual needs of the project;
(b) viability and cash flow of the project;
(c) creditworthiness of the borrowers;
(d) managerial competence of the borrower in undertaking the project;
and
(e) borrowers' excess of assets over liabilities (net worth).
6.        An equity participation of not less than 10 percent of the project cost
was required from the borrowers, either in cash or in kind.   Appropriate
requirements for collateral and insurance and guarantee coverage were also
imposed.
Capacity of LBP to APRraise the Sub-projects
7.        Definitely, LBP had the capability to appraise the sub-projects.  Even
before the World Bank loan, LBP had an existing term credit. The World Bank loan
simply augmented the existing loanable funds of LBP.   The LBP staff had
appropriate and adequate training and work experience in loan appraisal and over-
all project management.
8.        The performance of the term credit component of the World Bank loan
should be seen in the context of the economic and political conditions prevailing
at the time. Cooperatives were fledgling and nascent and, therefore, LBP had to
retail its term credit to individual farmers.   Also, deteriorating economic
conditions during the early 1980s were a major factor in the slow down of the
rural economy and poor collection'rate rather than just the lack of capability
of LBP to appraise, disburse and supervise the loan.
9.        LBP's ability to expand its network of field offices and branches was
constrained not by its weakness but by external factors, particularly stringent
requirements and restrictions of the Central Bank. LBP had a complete plan for
its expansion but was hampered by the CB policies.

Comments:
Issues Raised following Field Appraisal
(a)  Institutional.  The status of the Land Bank as a major agricultural
lending institution was questioned. Of its total lending, only 24% went
to agriculture and 762 to commerce and industry. There was also some
concern about the importance of government deposits (962 of the total)
relative to private savings.
(b)  Financial.  The ability of small farmers to repay land amortization
loans was also raised since, given LBP's inability to foreclose on bad
debtors, borrowers tended to regard these and other government loans as
grants.
(c)   Term Credit.  Assumptions for livestock models were queried.
(d)  Infrastructure development.  Concern was expressed regarding the
adequacy of preparation of the infrastructure component. In the event,
suitable specifications were not agreed until the third year of the
project, requiring amendment of the project documents.

e/   Of which US$15.1 million were distributed in the first 3 years.
f/   Of which US$3.3 million were spent in the first three years, thus already exceeding by
far the appraisal estimates for that period.
Comments
Total project costs, as provided by LBP,11 exceeded original
estimates by about 78%, essentially due to the following factors:
(a)      the much longer disbursement period (7 years), i.e. 4 years more than
anticipated at appraisal;
Adjusted by the mission for seasonal credit, taking only incremental requirements for
each year with a recovery rate assumed at 602.



- 18 -
(b)     the higher costs of investments and inputs financed under the credit
component, resulting from considerable price escalation (much more so
than contingencies aeopted at appraisal), especially in 1984 and 1985
when domestic inflation rates shot up to 50.32 and 23.1% respectively,
which were not entirely compensated by the devaluation of the Peso
vis-a-vis the US$. While this affected only marginally the total
amount distributed under term credit, constrained by slow demand and
delivery, it increased considerably seasonal credit, which accounted
for 46% of total cost estimates, but was not financed by the Bank
loan; and
(c)     the substantially higher costs to LBP of its field support services
(including studies and consultancies), stretched over a period which
was more than twice that originally planned. In retrospect, it
appears that the cost of this component was largely underestimated at
appraisal, particularly as there was no provision in contingencies
except for equipment expenditures.
The huge increase in short-term credit, in current terms, differed
significantly from appraisal estimates, as shown below:

Comments
Basis for Analysis.   Of the types of investments financed through
term credit under the project, LBP gathered data for about 10 models, derived
from a survey conducted in 1985 of the reported actual yields obtained and
costs incurred of representative farmer borrowers. On that basis, cash flows
were prepared by LBP staff in current terms, using actual input and output
prices during the period 1980-1985. Some of the assumptions appear to be
unrealistic (particularly the cattle fattening model, which was left out by
the mission) or should be treated with caution. However, in the absence of
any better information, the financial analysis and rate of return calculations
for the investment models were carried out using the technical data provided
(attached to each cash flow; available in Regional Files). Since not all the
investments induced by the project are represented by these models, no
aggregate rate of return was calculated.
Assumptions. Individual cash flows and rates of return have been
estimated over a period representing the life of the investment - in general
five years, except for the rice mill (10 years). In the financial analysis,
debt service is included, according to LBP's terms and conditions for
agricultural loans. While figures on incomes and costs were kept in current
terms, the rates of return were calculated by bringing the LBP data to
constant prices of the final year (generally 1985), using input/output prices
of that year and/or annual domestic inflation rates as estimated by the
National Statistics Office.
The economic analysis was carried out by applying a Standard
Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.86 and a series of specific conversion factors
estimated by the World Bank in 1985, as well as other conversion factors
estimated by the mission for some items such as paddy and fertilizers (Annex
1).
Results. The financial and economic results are generally much lower
than those obtained at appraisal (see Annex 2; detailed tables for each model
are available in Regional Files). Of the models analyzed, only four were
clearly profitable: pig breeding, fishpond, duck raising to a lesser extent,
and the tricyle model. In these activities, where relatively low-cost
investments have induced fairly quick and substantial returns, the impact made
by the project on borrower (farmer or entrepreneur) income appears to have
been good. On the other hand, the remaining models representing, in
particular, investments in farm mechanisation and post-harvest facilities,
yield very low or negative rates of return. The large discrepancies with
original estimates may be explained by the over-optimistic assumptions adopted
at appraisal, the more so when compared with actual results - in particular:
a "with project" yield of 75 to 80 cavans (3.7 to 4 t) of irrigated paddy per
ha when LBP survey figures consistently show a full development yield (after 5
years) of 60.8 (3 t) per ha, i.e. 20 to 252 less than alLticipated; a milling
capacity of 30,600 cavans per year when only about 12Z (3,750 cavans) of that
was actually achieved by the LBP client, with a mill of similar
specifications; likewise, 9,600 cavans assumed threshed per year in the rice



- 23 -
thresher model when only 3,700 cavans (less than 40%) were reported in the LBP
data; rental incomes expected from the power tiller and irrigation pump
models, which did not materialize, as well as warehousing charges in addition
to milling revenues in the rice mill model; and investment costs which are
considerably lower (e.g. by two-thirds, in constant terms, in the poultry
model) than those which were eventually incurred by LBP borrowers. Low
productivity resulted mainly from inefficient technical support from both the
Agricultural Department and 'BP field staff.
Conclusions. In retrospect, it is not surprising that there was slow
delivery of term credit in the initial years and that some of the sub-projects
which were eventually financed stopped being operational after a certain time,
as reported by LBP itself. However, if much lower adoption rates were
realized for uneconomic items like irrigation pumps (about a third of original
targets), loan data provided by LBP indicate that, despite the obvious
unprofitability of farm mechanization equipment (power tillers, threshers and
rice mills), the numbers of these items which were actually financed exceeded
original estimates (e.g. 1,100 power tillers as against 900 targeted, 650
threshers as against 120 originally anticipated).
