PHILIPPINES
SMALL FARMER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
LAND BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES /1
1. BACKGROUND
General
1.01      The Government of the Philippines has requested Bank assistance in
financing a program of credit, supporting services and facilities for small-
scale farmers especially those subject to the Agrarian Reform Program (see
paras. 1.08-1.11). The project is estimated to cost US$37.0 million of which
the Bank would contribute US$16.5 million, and would include: (i) production
credit primarily for rice, corn and vegetables; (ii) term credit for light
farm mechanization, post-harvest facilities, backyard livestock and poultry,
and selected cottage industries; (iii) strengthening of the field operations
of LBP; (iv) minor infrastructural works in agrarian reform concentration
areas; and (v) studies aimed at a better understanding of the economic and
social conditions of smallscale agriculture. The project would be implemented
by the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) except for the infrastructural works
which would be implemented by the appropriate line agencies.
1.02      In addition to being complementary to other Bank supported projects,
particularly the proposed National Extension project (Staff Appraisal Report
No. 2049-PH), this project would address itself to the range of development
needs (technical assistance, infrastructure and credit) of the lower strata
of the small-scale farmers, generally eschewed by the other institutional
credit sources. It would also promote increased production of the staple
food crops as well as foster diversification of farming activities and rural
employment.
1.03      The project would be spread throughout the country but concen-
tration would occur in certain areas according to the geographical distri-
bution of the agrarian reform. Its scope is geared to the present and
proposed capacity of LBP's field staff.
The Agricultural Sector
1.04      Agriculture is the predominant sector of the Philippine economy,
accounting for about 30% of GDP, slightly more than 50% of total employment,
and 55-60% of the foreign exchange earnings. Nearly three quarters of the
land under cultivation is devoted to grains production, notably rice and
/1  The present report reflects the findings of Bank mission which visited the
Philippines in July-August 1977 (Messrs. J. Brown, I. Moreithi and Ms. H.
Schaengold - IBRD: Messrs V. Raswant and R.W. Jessup - Consultants);
February-March 1978 (Messrs J. Brown and I. Moreithi); and May-June 1978
(Messrs. J. Brown, I. Moreithi - IBRD; and R.W. Jessop - consultant). The
project was prepared by the Land Bank of the Philippines assisted by Bank
staff.

corn; other principal crops are sugar, coconuts, abaca, pineapple and tobacco.
About 70% of the Philippines population of 42.5 million lives in the rural
areas, with 60% depending directly on agriculture.
1.05      After recovering from severe weather conditions during 1970-73, the
sector has been growing remarkably well at about 5% p.a. between 1974-77, and
significant growth is also expected in 1978. The high rate of growth was
particularly buoyed by record rice and corn harvests resulting from Government
sponsored production credit programs (see paras. 2.07-2.10), better weather
conditions, expansion and improvement of irrigation facilities, and more
favorable producer prices.
1.06      The Government has been committed to a policy of self-sufficiency
in food and feed grains since the mid-1960s. After the 1970-73 production
setbacks, rice imports have been steadily declining and the country realized
token exports in 1977. It is estimated that exports would reach 100,000 tons
in 1978./l The overall performance of the agricultural sector has also
contributed to a more favorable growth rate of rural family incomes compared
to those of urban families. Nonetheless of the 15 million people in the
lower 40% of the income scale, 12 million are found in the rural areas.
1.07      Structurally, Philippine agriculture is overwhelmingly small-scale.
The national average landholding is about 3.6 ha. Most of the nonmarginal
lands, especially in the lowland areas, are under cultivation. Agricultural
development and improvement of farm incomes therefore critically depend on
increased productivity of the already cultivated lands. Improved technology
for rice cultivation has considerably raised the production potential of the
irrigated areas, and appreciable progress has been made towards full exploi-
tation of this potential. However, no comparable technological base exists at
present for yield improvement in the rainfed upland areas where corn is the
major crop. The development of the upland areas therefore remains problematical,
though some diversification opportunities do exist.
Tenure System and Agrarian Reform
1.08      About 29% of all farms in the Philippines are under tenancy and
another 12% are under part-ownership (1971 Philippines Agricultural Census).
The tenancy and part-ownership incidence is heavily concentrated in rice
lands where it amounts to 53% of all farms. Tenancy terms include payment of
cash rentals and fixed amount of produce but the most common one is 50-50
share cropping. Landlords typically provide a wide range of services to
their tenants: production and consumption credit, assistance in procurement
of farm inputs and marketing of the produce, and guidance on farm management.
In some cases, the landlords also share in the production costs.
/1 A recent Bank Sector Review Mission estimates that the Philippines would
attain sustainable self-sufficiency in rice by early 1980s. Meanwhile,
there may be periodic imports depending on the weather conditions.

1.09      Since 1972, the Government policy has aimed at establishing family-
owned smallholdings as the foundation of the Philippine agriculture. All
tenanted rice and corn farms were therefore declared land reform areas
under Presidential Decree No. 27 of October 1972. The reform falls into two
parts: Operation Land Transfer /1 applicable to all farms (Estates) above 7
ha, whereby the tenants become owner-cultivators undertaking to pay for the
land over a period of 15 years; and the Leasehold Enforcement Program /2 for
all farms (Estates) up to 7 ha. Table 1 shows the overall scope of the
reform, while Annex 1, Table 1 shows the regional distribution of Operation
Land Transfer.

1.10      The Ministry of Agrarian Reform (MAR) is responsible for the
overall administration and implementation of the program, /3 while LBP is
concerned with the financing of land acquisition under Operation Land
/1  Covering 759,000 ha and 393,000 tenants.
/2  Covering 664,000 ha and 521,600 tenants.
/3  Under Operation Land Transfer, MAR's responsibilities include:  identi-
fying tenants and landlords and initiating the transfer process; surveying
the land parcels; ensuring proper land valuation; documenting land titles;
and issuing Certificates of Land Transfer (CLT) which certifies that the
holder is the actual tiller of the land parcel he claims.

Transfer./l Completion of land transfer was originally expected to require
only five years from October 1972. But after a briefly rapid pace during
1973, the implementation progress slowed down considerably principally as a
result of poor land survey and records causing long delays in title documenta-
tion, prolonged haggling over land valuation, inadequate institutional frame-
work and resources within MAR, and opposition by the landlords. The progress
has improved slightly since mid-1977.
1.11      Table 2 shows the progress achieved by the end of March 1978.
About 226,800 farmers cultivating 444,900 had been issued Certificates
of Land Transfer (CLT). The farms fully and partially compensated by LBP
amounted to 96,200 ha involving 49,900 tenants, of whom about 37,600 had
signed Farmers' Undertakings./2 While the implementation progress may
remain slow, a significant number of farmers have already become amortizing
owner-cultivators; the number will continue to increase. These farmers need
specialized attention to move them to the point where they can be self-
sustaining after the severance from the landlords upon whom they previously
depended for a wide range of assistance (see para 1.08).
/1 LBP verifies land documents submitted to it by MAR; arranges for the
signing of Farmers Undertaking; and pays the affected landlords at 10%-20%
cash and the balance in LBP bonds.
/2 A Farmer's Undertaking commits the farmer to pay LBP the land amortizations;
they signify the end of the land transfer process, the only remaining task
being the collection by LBP of the amortizations receivable.

2.   THE PROJECT'S TARGET GROUP AND SUB-SECTORS
The Target Group
2.01      The bulk of the project's target group would consist of agrarian
reform farmers. Other project's beneficiaries would include: owner-culti-
vators who acquired land by other means, as well as leaseholders; rural
entrepreneurs engaged in enterprises of direct benefit to small-scale farmers;
and cottage industries entrepreneurs.
2.02      Economic Conditions:  The average size of the agrarian reform farms
is about 1.9 ha. Rice accounts for 80-90% of farm income in the lowlands
while corn predominates in the uplands. Such supplementary sources of
farm income as are available to the farmers consist of fruits and vegetables,
especially in areas near to the urban centers, and backyard livestock and
poultry. The level of productivity is generally lower than national averages
due to inadequate and/or improper application of farm inputs, low standards
of crops and animal husbandary, and infrastructural deficiencies. Wide
variations in yields exist from farmer to farmer, even under similar produc-
tion conditions, suggesting correspondingly varying farm management capabili-
ties and the need for more rigorous technical extension services. The
family's need to ensure self-sufficiency in staple food grains inhibits the
adoption of cash crops, some of which, on account of their higher unit value,
would appreciably raise farm cash incomes and reduce the risks associated
with monocropping.
2.03      Table 3 illustrates the economic conditions typically facing the
agrarian reform farmers. Family income amounts to about P 4,600 while per
capita income is about P 800 per annum. This compares with the poverty
line per capita income estimated at about P 1,124 for the rural Philippines.

2.04      Adequate irrigation facilities in many lowland areas permit multiple
cropping and more or less continuous employment. The situation is different
in rainfed areas and those with inadequate irrigation facilities, particularly
the uplands. In such areas the need for diversification is real and impera-
tive; some diversification opportunities exist and include the cultivation of
high value crops such as vegetables, development of backyard livestock and
poultry, and cottage industries using locally available raw materials.
Project's Sub-Sectors
2.05      Agricultural Credit and Debt Problem.  Despite the lower cost of
credit now available from institutional sources compared to that previously
extended by the landlords and other informal sources, the debt condition of
smallholders has in many cases deteriorated in the last five years (see
para. 2.08). The informal loans had highly flexible repayment schedule; while
share-cropping was expensive, it involved risk sharing with the landlords
since the absolute amount of payment varied with actual production. Now the
farmer must meet fixed obligations for land amortization or rentals, and for
Government-sponsored credit.



-8-
2.06      Annex 2, Table 1 shows the trend in agricultural credit during
the first half of the 1970s. The total volume rose considerably, in monetary
terms,/l for all subsectors. However, the Philippine agricultural credit
system still reflects the dualistic nature of the sector, with food crops
accounting for only about one quarter of production credit./2
2.07      The increase in lending for food crops was a result of Government
sponsored production credit programs, notably Masagana 99 for rice and
Masaganang Maisan for corn and feed grains./3 Annex 2, Tables 2 and 3 show
the performance of the two programs.  While the programs have succeeded in
reaching a vast number of small-scale farmers (the average Masagana 99
borrower had an average landholding of about 1.9 ha) and in boosting total
production, they have been characterized by sharp declines in all respects
since 1974./4
2.08      Poor loan repayment has been the main problem, partly due to
crop losses caused by natural calamities but also due to the over-stretching
of the credit delivery and recovery system in pursuit of emergency production
targets dictated by the 1970-73 crisis. Credit was extended generously to
borrowers ill-equipped to use it effectively and Masagana 99 ended its ninth
phase (May - October 1977) with loan arrears amounting to P 799.7 million, and
Masaganang Maisan P 110.0 million. A correspondingly large number of farmers
are now burdened by debt servicing loads in some cases exceeding the gross
value of their farm production./5 In effect, the number of borrowers has
/1  From an annual average of P 7,018.7 million during 1972-73 to P 17,977.8 mil-
lion during 1975-76.
/2  During 1975-76, about 62% of the loans went to export and large-scale
enterprises, while the food crop subsector, on which the majority of
farmers depend, received 24%.
/3  These programs were launched in 1973 as a reaction to the decline in
grains production caused by the 1970-73 adverse weather conditions.
Other production credit programs launched during the same period include:
Gulayan sa Kalusugan for vegetables; and cotton and tobacco production
schemes.
/4  After reaching the peak of 468,000 borrowers and P 715.9 million in
loans during its third phase, Masagana 99 steadily declined to only
72,600 borrowers and P 135.0 million of loans in its ninth phase
(May-October 1977); Masaganang Maisan has similarly been on a sharp
decline since its first phase; from 183,000 borrowers and P 171.9 mil-
lion loans in Phase one to only 16,200 borrowers and P 15.5 million
loans in Phase six.
/5  At an average loan of P 1,600 per borrower, the number of farmers still
in debt to Masagana 99 is about 499,900, and 110,000 for Masaganang
Maisan at average loan of P 900.



- 9 -
fallen sharply as defaulters are disqualified from further loans. But many of
the farmers still need seasonal credit, if they are to take full advantage of
the available technology.
2.09      Now that rice production is no longer a crisis issue, the Government
policy is shifting to more selective lending, according to the debt repayment
capacity of the would-be borrowers, coupled with more rigorous technical and
farm management support to ensure better use of the resources available to
the farmers. Seasonal credit under the proposed project would be governed
by this new policy (see para. 5.07).
2.10      Light Farm Mechanization:  The majority of the small-scale farmers
in the Philippines depend on animal traction (carabaos) and manual labor for
farm work. Although underemployment is wide spread in the rural areas, labor
bottlenecks are a constraint during the land preparation, planting and har-
vesting seasons especially in areas where multiple cropping is practised.
The carabaos are disadvantaged by inability to work for long hours without
prolonged rest intervals, susceptibility to disease which may strike at the
critical moment in the cropping cycle, and inability to cope with dryland
tillage.
2.11      An increasing proportion of farmers is accordingly turning to power
tillers, either self-owned or on custom service./l The use of power tillers,
however, raises the problem of ensuring full utilization of effective capacity
in addition to difficulties arising from unavailability of spare parts and main-
tenance facilities particularly in the more remote rural areas. The proposed
project would aim at minimizing these problems through group planning approach
within the concept of "Estate Development Planning" (see para. 5.06) and provision
of farm machinery repair and maintenance workshops.
2.12      Post-harvest Facilities:  An appreciable amount of grain production
in the Philippines is lost annually due to poor post-harvest facilities
and handling. The heaviest losses are attributed to inadequate drying
expecially in the wet season./2 Though at the national level there is
over capacity of milling and warehousing facilities, their geographical
distribution leaves some areas without conveniently located facilities. The
proposed project would support initiatives to make such facilities available,
taking into account the already existing capacity.
/1  Locally manufactured power tillers are now readily available.  While the
use of power tillers would result in reduced labor usage in land prepara-
tion per crop/ha, increased cropping intensity facilitated by more speedy
land preparation would have a counter-balancing effect.
/2 Apart from physical losses, grains with moisture content in excess of 14%
fetch lower prices.



- 10 -
2.13      Diversification Opportunities: Pigs and Cattle:  It is estimated
that 80-90% of the pork consumed in the Philippines comes from small backyard
pig enterprises. There is, therefore,'widespread experience in pig husbandry
among small farmers. Although the usual pig diseases are prevalent, the
necessary veterinary services and supplies are readily available throughout
the country. A range of farm by-products exists which, with about 50% prepared
feeds, could provide an adequate diet. While the supply of improved breeds is
still insufficient, this would not have a serious impact   on the development
of the backyard piggeries. Backyard piggeries therefore offer scope for
considerable expansion subject to technical advisory services and credit being
made available.
2.14      Backyard beef-cattle raising /1 accounts for over 70% of the
national cattle population. But the system is generally characterized
by poor husbandry and management which, in addition to the inferior types of
animals kept, result in low productivity. Most of the cattle diseases are
well under control. The main development constraints include: inadequate
supply of fattening stocks, relatively poor knowledge regarding the proper
nutrition regimes, and deficient marketing facilities in the more remote
rural areas. Owing to the quicker turn-over, the majority of the smallholders
prefer fattening to breeding operations, but there is scope for modest expan-
sion of both types of operations.
2.15      Diversification Opportunities:  Poultry:  The constraints are less
binding for the development of small-scale poultry keeping compared to livestock,
particularly since it is much easier to import foundation stock for which
local multiplication facilities are well established. The usual poultry
diseases and pests are prevalent,/2 and the mortality from Newcastle's disease
is high; but preventive measures are readily available and widely used. While
the domestic supply of poultry feed is insufficient and has to be supplemented
by imports it is unlikely to pose insuperable problems to backyard poultry
keepers as feedmills in most areas of the Philippines offer a wide range of
mixed feeds.
2.16      The number of large-scale poultry producers ("integraters")
using very modern production techniques has been rising steadily. The
majority are fully vertically integrated from feed milling, hatcheries,
broilers production to processing and marketing. Many of them enter into
contracts with small-scale out-producers, supplying day-old chicks to the
out-producers and repurchasing mature birds for processing and marketing.
/1 There are three beef cattle raising systems in the Philippines: upland
ranching; cattle-coconut integration; and the backyard system which is
the common one among small-scale farmers.
/2 Ducks have the advantage of being less susceptible to diseases than
layers and broilers.



- 11 -
2.17      Diversification Opportunities:  Cottage Industries:  The need for the!
development of cottage industries in the Philippines is underscored by the
mounting number of landless and the high growth rate of the labor force
(2.6% per annum). The probable growth of the agriculture sector would not be
adequate to productively accommodate such a high increase of the labor force.
2.18      The Philippines has a variety of thriving cottage industries.
The majority use locally available raw materials and produce mostly for the
domestic market. Exports have grown rapidly from P 129,000 in 1970 to
P 1.08 million in 1975, especially for shell craft, needlework, fibrecraft
and bamboo-rattan products. Many of the cottage industries have a long
tradition behind them and expertise is wide spread; nonetheless, training is
constantly needed especially for the industries aiming at the more sophisti-
cated export markets./l The proposed project would support these initiatives,
giving special emphasis to charcoal production, making of concrete products,
fibercraft, and embroidery and garments.
2.19      Infrastructure:  Some of the agrarian reform areas are handicapped
by infrastructural deficiencies particularly in irrigation facilities, feeder
roads and flood control structures. Many of these deficiencies can be
alleviated with minor civil works such as distribution canals, village roads
and water control dykes. Small irrigation pumps would also help to expand
irrigation facilities./2 The development of pump irrigation is, however,
restricted by inadequate groundwater survey and undefined water use rights.
In some communities overexploitation of groundwater has lowered the water
table to inaccessible levels, leaving pumps idle; this highlights the import-
ance of cautious and limited support for further investments of this type./3
Some scope, however, exists for low lift pumps tapping surface sources.
2.20      Field Extension Services:  Appreciable progress has been made
towards the improvement and intensification of the extension services, particu-
larly under Masagana 99. Major problems however remain as to how best to
coordinate the many extension agencies, in contrast to the previous one
/1 The National Cottage Industries Development Authority provides the needed
training in addition to undertaking other activities to promote the
development of these industries.
/2 It is estimated that privately owned irrigation pumps now cover about
60,000 ha.
/3 The Bank is supporting groundwater surveys in Tarlac through Loan 1080-PH,
and in parts of Nueva Ecija and Pangansinan through Loan 1526-PH.

landlord, demanding the attention of the farmer. From the proposed project's
viewpoint, the immediate needs are, at the level of the day-to-day contact
with the farmer: to make the extension services more rigorously attuned to
the imperatives of effective credit delivery and recovery system; to ensure
effective coordination among the various agencies; and to focus more intensely
on the project's target group. To accomplish these ends, the project would
include the strengthening of LBP's field staff, particularly with the appoint-
ment of Estate Development Coordinators for each 300-500 farmers in the
project area. These officers would depend on the technical support functions
of line agency field staff; their presence is intended to provide a focus for
coordination, and an additional dimension of financial management assistance
and supervision for the project's beneficiaries (see para. 5.04).
2.21      Economic and Social Research:  The current state of knowledge, in
the Philippines as elsewhere in the developing world, regarding the economic
and social conditions of small-scale agriculture leaves major gaps, many
of which have strong bearing on effective use of credit and other resources
available to small-scale farmers. Little empirical evidence exists to
guide policies and procedures (on, for example, marketing, inputs delivery,
options in the development administration processes, and farm planning and
management) relating to small-scale agriculture in general and agrarian
reform farmers in particular. The project would therefore support action-
oriented studies to be undertaken by the University of the Philippines
(Centre for Policy and Development Studies) under contract with LBP (see
paras. 4.12 to 4.13).
3. THE LAND BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES (LBP)
3.01      LBP would be responsible for implementing the project except for
infrastructural works to be executed by line agencies. Annex 3 presents
details regarding its functions, structure, financial conditions, and operat-
ing policies and procedures.
3.02      The Land Bank of the Philippines was established by Republic Act
No. 3844 in 1964 and its authority and mandate were considerably broadened by
Presidential Decree No. 251 in 1973. In addition to the general powers
vested in it under the Corporation Law and the General Banking Act, LBP is
specifically authorized to accept deposits, issue debt instruments, extended
loans and guarantees, invest in commercial paper, and to act as trustee. Its
credit activities may be "for the establishment, development or expansion of
agricultural, industrial, home building or home financing projects or other
productive enterprises. Its primary responsibility is to serve as the
financial arm of agrarian reform, to make cash payments and to issue bonds to
former landlords, to effect and hold farmers' amortization agreements and to
provide credit in support of the productive activities of beneficiaries. Its
commercial banking activities are intended to generate revenue to offset a
portion of the public sector cost of agrarian reform.



- 13 -
Significance of LBP's Role in Agricultural Credit
3.03      LBP started lending operations in 1974 and its agricultural
lending remains comparatively modest, though it has been rising sharply./l
Nonetheless, LBP is the only banking institution specifically charged with
assisting the lower strata of the small-scale farmers, and current management
policies are moving the Bank positively toward this area which remains
inadequately served by other credit institutions in the Philippines. LBP
also has uniquely high financial stakes in the development of the small-holder
owner-cultivators on whom it entirely depends to liquidate the liabilities
arising from land transfer operations.
3.04      Its corporate goals accord high priority to assisting the former
tenants now owner-cultivators to increase farm productivity and incomes.
To this end, LBP has reoriented its operations towards increased agricultural
lending and developmental support. Underlying this move are three innovative
measures taken in the past year: the creation of a separate department to
implement the expanded agricultural program; the strengthening of the field
support services; and the proposed establishment of lending and loan collection
offices located in truly rural areas (see paras. 5.02 to 5.04).
Organization and Management
3.05      The activities of LBP are controlled by a Board of Directors con-
sisting of: the Minister for Finance (Chairman); LBP's President (Vice-Chairman);
the Minister for Agrarian Reform; and the Minister for Labor. As part of a
consolidation program after a period of rapid expansion, LBP restructured
its organization during the first half of 1978. The new structure reflects
a more rigorous delineation and delegation of functional responsibilities,
and identification of profit and cost centers. Annex 3, Chart I, presents
LBP's current organization and outlines the functions of the various depart-
ments and divisions.
Staffing
3.06      LBP's total staff amounts to 703 (May 30, 1978), of which 215 are
in the field. Though LBP has succeeded in building up a sizeable cadre of
qualified, experienced and well motivated staff, there have been substantial
and critical staff shortages at all levels and departments.   Of particular
importance to the proposed project are the recruitment of Estate Development
Coordinators (see para. 5.04) and field loan appraisers. LBP is fully aware
of these deficiencies and successful efforts have recently been made to
recruit a satisfactory number of Estate Development Coordinators, enough to
ensure efficient launching of the proposed project. Recruitment measures
are underway to fill all the critical positions in anticipation of expanded
lending operations (see para. 5.05).
/1 P 1.2 million of outstanding loans in 1975; P 3.2 million in 1976 and
P 79.3 million in 1977.



- 14 -
Financial Structure and Conditions
3.09      Financial Structure:  LBP's authorized capital is P 3 billion
of which the Government contribution will eventually amount to P 1.8 bil-
lion./1 The paid-in capital was P 1,120.8 million at the end of 1977
(see Table 4). LBP is heavily dependent on governmental funds. In addition
to the entire paid-in capital, the Government accounts for more than 90% of
deposits; however, private deposits have risen sharply from less than P 1 mil-
lion in 1974 to P 43 million as of December 31, 1977. LBP's financial struc-
ture is sound, with the debt-equity ratio remaining satisfactory, while
the liquidity ratio has continued to be high (See Table 4). The high
liquidity reflects LBP's policy of maintaining a substantial reserve as a
precautionary measure against an upsurge in land transfer operations.
3.10      Earning Performance and Resources Flow.  Table 5 summarizes opera-
tional results for the last three years. Net income dropped from P 61.9 mil-
lion in 1976 to P 58.1 million largely due to higher increase in costs, but
rose slightly to P 58.6 million in 1977. The debt-service ratio remains
adequate though it has fallen from 2.2 in 1975 to 1.6 in 1976 and 1977.
Investments in short-term securities remain the major source of total gross
earnings. However, income from loans has risen sharply reflecting the increas-
ing share of the loans in the total portfolio of earning assets.
3.11      Annex 3, Table 5 presents the sources and uses of funds.  Deposits,
most of them govermental, were the single largest source of funds in 1975
and 1977 but the probability of withdrawal, as happened in 1976, is a major
destabilizing factor in the flow of resources. Bonds payable in connection
with Operation Land Transfer rank second and are characterized by a steady
growth. Amortizations receivable are at present not very significant but
will progressively become so and increasingly constitute, in the absence of
effective measures to improve their collection, the highest risk assets
in LBP's portfolio. Among the uses of funds, current assets predominate in
keeping with the LBP policy of maintaining high liquidity. Allocation of
funds to loans has risen steadily from P 20.4 million in 1975 to P 338.2 mil-
lion in 1977.
/1 After the initial contribution of P 400 million plus annual contri-
bution of P 100 million, the total to amount to P 1.8 billion around
during the next seven years or so.

3.12      Financial Prospects.  Annex 3, Table 5 shows the long-term resources
at the end of 1977. LBP has no long-term debt maturing before 1986; its
financial prospects depend primarily on: the land transfer implementation
rate; land amortization collection rate; commercial banking growth rate; and
growth rate in its investment portfolio./l The progress of the land transfer
operations is unpredictable as it depends on socio-political climate, though
it is unlikely that it could be completed before another 15 years. Land
amortization collection has been very low at 20% in 1976 and 16% in 1977,
and, at those levels, poses serious implications for LBP financial future.
It is however expected that the new measures now underway (see paras. 5.03-
5.04) and the proposed project will improve the prospects by increasing farm
income and by strengthening the collection machinery at the field level.
/1 The mission estimates that with 15 years to complete the land transfer,
amortization collections at about 30% of amounts due per year, growth of
deposits at 5% and investment portfolio at 2.5%, LBP would maintain
positive cash flows throughout the period of its land transfer obligations.
These are attainable performance targets.

Principal Operations and Policies
3.13      Lending Operations.  LBP has set three orders of preference for its
lending operations: first priority, agrarian reform farmers and landlords/LBP
bondholders; second, borrowers engaged in businesses of benefit to the
agrarian reform farmer or otherwise promoting the objectives of the reform;
third, nonpriority clients. The general policy is to allocate the loanable
funds so that 35% goes to each of the first two groups and 30% to the third
one, but these allocation targets have not as yet been achieved.  Nearly 76%
of loans granted in 1977 went to commercial and industrial clients (see
Table 6). Lending to the third priority group is of a wholesaling nature to
prime corporations.

3.14      Total outstanding loans rose from P 140.1 million in 1976 to
P 338.2 million in 1977, while agricultural loans increased sharply from only
P 3.2 million to P 79.3 million in the same period. Loans repayments have
been satisfactory especialy for the agricultural loans in respect of which
the delinquency rate fell from 9.5% in 1976 to 7.5% in 1977 (see Table 7);
this compares most favorably with the prevailing situation in the Philippines
regarding repayment of agricultural loans (see Annex 2, Tables 2 and 3).

3.17      Efforts to pursue agrarian and commerical banking objectives through
a common network of branches have not proven satisfactory, in large part due
to the need to locate branches in urban centers where commercial banking
opportunities are more available. LBP has realized this shortcoming and has
begun to establish small low-cost field offices in truly rural areas. The
main function is to serve needs of small-scale farmers, free from preoccupation
with commercial banking.
4. THE PROJECT
4.01      The objective of the proposed project is to increase rural incomes
by enhancing the productivity of small farms and generating off-farm
employment opportunities. A key feature would be the coordinated delivery
of technical assistance, improved infrastructure and credit to beneficiaries
of the agrarian reform program. Development efforts in the selected project
areas would be based on a careful assessment of needs by farmers and the
field staff of concerned agencies. While the project would be small in
relation to need, the complexity of issues to be addressed, the poor financial
condition of most potential beneficiaries, and the limited field capacity of
the Land Bank require cautious initial efforts. However, the project is
designed in terms of both financial and manpower inputs to be widely replicable
as experience and capacity increase. Support would also be included for
Land Bank's ongoing traditional small-scale credit operations wherein individual
or group credit is extended for investments not constrained by infrastructural
or managerial deficiencies.
Project Area
4.02      During project preparation, initial profiles were prepared of all
estates that have been transferred to tenants under the Agrarian Reform
Program. On the basis of need, potential, contiguity and proximity to
existing or proposed Land Bank field offices, 60 areas have been selected
for project assistance during the next three years. Each consists of one or
more former estates with a total population of 300 to 500 farm families, and
in many cases constitutes a distinct geographic unit. While this represents
less than 5% of the declared Agrarian Reform area of the country, project
scope has been constrained by its innovative features, by the present
implementation capacity of the Land Bank, and by the absorptive capacity of
beneficiaries with respect to financial and managerial undertakings.
Manpower and financial commitments to these areas have been kept to levels
which are replicable on a wide scale as experience and capacity increase.
Project Components
4.03     The credit and infrastructure components described in the following
paragraphs have been determined on the basis of field surveys. While estimates
of the number of individual loans have been made for purposes of project cost
allocation and phasing (see Annex 4, Table 1) the actual distribution of
proceeds will vary according to the demand of the borrowers and the results
of detailed infrastructure surveys.
4.04      Production Credit.  In many cases short-term credit for fertilizer,
crop protection chemicals, seed and hired labor is the most critical need of
small farmers. The project would provide such credit primarily for rice,



- 20 -
corn and vegetables over an area that is expected to grow to about 30,000 ha
in the third year. Individual loans would be based on a farm plan and budget
and credit needs would be determined on a yearly basis with disbursements
and repayments phased to coincide with the cash flow pattern over that period.
While there are sufficient farmers in the project area without serious debt
problems to absorb the proposed credit, efforts would be made to assist some
who do have such problems. Arrangements would be made on a case-to-case basis
between LBP and other creditors with respect to supervision responsibility,
rescheduling, and distribution of collection proceeds.
4.05      Marketing Credit.  The Land Bank's credit support of palay
marketing would be expanded under the project./l Authorized Samahang Nayons
and Area Marketing Cooperatives which meet criteria of financial and
managerial capability and which procure palay in project areas would receive
working capital loans. One current practice that would be encouraged under
such loans is the advance of funds to farmers against deposited stocks,
which enable producers to meet urgent financial obligations while postponing
final sale of their produce until seasonal price fluctuations favor disposal.
4.05      Light Farm Mechanization.  The project would finance mechanical draft
power, primarily locally manufactured power tillers of 7-10 hp capable of
ploughing and double harrowing   one ha in 40 hours.  The project would also
finance a limited number of shallow well irrigation pumps (4" diameter and
capable of irrigating 7 ha) at a cost of P 8,800 installed set, including
about P 3,000 for shallow tubewells where necessary. Rehabilitation and
improvement of existing surface pumps, of which there are many at present
unused, would be another important feature of the project. Other minor items
(sprayers and hand tools) would be included as required.
4.06      Post-harvest and Other Farm Support Facilities.  These would
include: portable rice threshers powered by a 10 hp engine with a capacity of
20 cavans per hour; portable rice driers equipped with a 3 hp engine, with a
capacity of 23 cavans in 5 hours; small rice mills (10 cavans/hour capacity)
and warehouses in areas not conveniently serviced by the existing facilities.
The project would also include light cargo trucks (0.5 to 1.5 tons), and
agricultural machinery repair and mintenance workshops, where such facilities
are not available.
4.07      Backyard Livestock.  Particularly in unirrigated areas this activity
represents a very important source of productive family employment and cash
income. The appropriate size and type of enterprise would vary considerably
among regions but typical investments to be financed under the project would
be: piggeries - 2 sows and 15 fatteners; poultry - 200 layers and 100
broilers; ducks for eggs and meat - 200 birds; and cattle fattening - one
breeding cow and three fatteners.
4.08      Cottage Industries.  The rural labor force is growing much faster
than the potential absorbtive capacity of agriculture, and nonfarm employment
/1  In addition to its own credit support, particularly to SN's and AMC's,
the Land Bank is the channel for a P 200 million line of credit to the
National Grains Authority (NGA) for palay procurement through private
traders.

opportunities must develop to fill this gap. While the long term development
strategy of the sector and a number of important issues such as marketing
have yet to be considered, there is considerable scope for a number of activ-
ities depending primarily on local markets. Indicative project enterprises
are: concrete products, embroidery and garments, and fibercraft and charcoal
making.
4.09      Minor Infrastructure.  On the basis of development plans for
project areas and feasibility studies by appropriate line agencies, the
project would finance minor infrastructure works such as feeder roads,
irrigation canals and flood control dykes when these are critical to economic
development. Although ongoing programs of responsible agencies, some of which
presently receive Bank support, do include the type of works envisaged, the
component is included in this project to facilitate, through supplementary
budget allocation, the execution of works which are small and scattered and
have not been given adequate attention in the national budgeting process of
the agencies concerned. It is estimated that the infrastructural works
would involve roughly 120 km of feeder roads, improvement of flood control
structures serving about 2,700 ha, and rehabilitation of irrigation systems
for about 4,100 ha.
4.10      Strengthening LBP Field Operations.  It is considered essential for
LBP to strengthen its presence among the farmers particularly among those who
can benefit from credit undertakings in addition to their land amortization
commitments under agrarian reform. Field representatives to be known as
Estate Development Coordinators (EDC) would be assigned to each project area
of 300-500 farmers. Over a three year period, they might be expected to
develop a credit portfolio of 150-300 loans. Their responsibilities would be
primarily in financial supervision and management and in coordinating the
activities of the other agencies with respect to planning and agricultural
extension (para. 5.05). Incremental costs of these personnel would include
salaries and allowances, vehicles (mostly motorcycles), as well as office
facilities, equipment and supplies.
4.11      Because of the lead time necessary to ensure staff availability for
project start-up, LBP has already recruited 30 EDCs, effective from April
1978, and conducted the necessary training for them (see para. 5.05). The
personnel and training costs arising from these advance measures constitute
an essential preparation towards the success of the proposed project and
would be eligible for retroactive financing. (Total retroactive IBRD financing
would amount to about US$120,000).
4.12      Socio-Economic Research.  This would involve action-oriented
studies on: agricultural credit prospects and delivery mechanism in the main
project areas; marketing of rice, pigs and poultry; development of appropriate
farmer supporting services and mechanism to attain farmers participation in
the developmental efforts; and the appropriate role of the local institutions
in the development of agrarian reform estates. Terms of reference for all
studies would be subject to Bank agreement.
4.13      The Center for Policy and Develpment Studies, University of the
Philippines at Los Banos (UPLB), would carry out these studies in addition to
providing training for LBP staff connected with the project as well as



- 22 -
general consultancy under a contract signed in May 1978. Securinig qualified
staff for this research work has necessitated release of local funds as of
July 1, 1978, and their costs would be eligible for retroactive financing
under the project.
Cost Estimates
4.14      Annex 4, Table 1 presents detailed project costings which are
summarized in the following Table 9. The total project costs are estimated
at P 268.0 million (US$ 37.0 million) to be committed over a period of three
years. The costs are based on price information prevailing at the end of May
1978.

Financing
4.15      The Bank's contribution would be US$16.5 million amounting to 45%
of the total project cost, equivalent to all foreign exchange costs, estimated
to total US$12.2 million (33% of project cost), plus $4.3 million of local
currency costs. Local cost financing is recommended in view of the high
proportion of local currency in small farmer credit needs and the emphasis of
the project on serving a group of beneficiaries, almost all of whom are within
the lower 40% of income levels in the Philippines. Proceeds of the Bank loan
to support LBP activities would be on-lent to LBP by the Government at the
same interest rate specified in the proposed Bank loan. The financing of the
project would, therefore, be as follows:

/a In kind and/or cash, at 10% for term credit.
/b From internally generated funds and rediscounting within Central Bank.
Conditions for the release of funds to the term credit subborrowers would be
as spelled out in the LBP terms and conditions of lending (see Annex 5,
Appendix A). Formal assurance was obtained from LBP that these terms and
conditions would not be materially altered or abrogated without approval by
the Bank. LBP's contribution under the project would be equivalent to only
13.5% of its liquid assets as of December 31, 1977. Counterpart funds for
the infrastructure component would be made available as budgetary allocation
from the Government.
4.16      Loan proceeds would be channelled through the Ministry of Finance
for on-lending to LBP, in the case of credit, research, training and LBP
establishment, and released to executing agencies in the case of infrastruc-
ture as approved by the Budget Commission.



- 25 -
Procurement
4.17      The various equipment and machinery for onfarm development and
farm support facilities would be purchased locally by the sub-borrowers under
the overall supervision and guidance of LBP to ensure that the prices is
reasonable. To this end, LBP maintains a system of accredited suppliers for
equipment and machinery as well as seasonal farm inputs, based on such consid-
erations as purchase price and the availability of parts and after-sale
service. Where feasible, borrowers would be required to solicit three price
quotations for equipment purchases. The procurement of service vehicles for
LBP field staff would be done through local competitive bidding while equipment
for LBP field offices, which would be procured in small lots, would be
purchased through-prudent shopping. Other works would be carried out as
follows:
(a)  Infrastructure.  Civil works would be widely scattered in small
jobs (estimated maximum US$100,000 equivalent) and would therefore
not be suited to international competitive bidding. The works
would be executed by the appropriate line agencies under force
account or through local contracts in accordance with standard
bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank.
(b)  Training, Research and Consultancy.  These would be carried out by
the University of the Philippines (Centre for Policy and Development
Studies) subject to Bank approval of curricula, terms of reference,
and conditions of consultant employment.
4.18      While all these project components would be procured locally,
foreign firms are well represented locally and therefore have the opportunity
to participate should they consider it in their interest. The number of
foreign and local firms is adequate to ensure effective competition in all
cases except in a few remote areas.
Disbursement
4.19      The disbursement of the loan proceeds would be as follows:
(a)  on-lending for term credit:  65% of loans disbursed by LBP against
quarterly statements of expenditure;
(b)  LBP Field Support Services:  vehicles and office equipment at 100%
of foreign exchange or ex-factory cost or 50% of off-the-shelf cost,
against normal documents;
(c)  infrastructural works:  55%, against certified quarterly statements
of expenditure if executed by force account, or against normal
documents if executed by local contract;
(d)  training, research and studies:  100% of total costs of Bank-approved
research and studies, against normal documents.



- 26 -
In all cases where disbursement is to be made against certified statement of
expenditure, the supporting documents will be retained by the borrower or
the Land Bank and held available for inspection during the course of super-
vision missions. An estimated schedule of expenditure, disbursement
and envisaged allocation of funds is shown in Annex 4, Table 1.
Accounts and Audit
4.20      Separate accounts would be maintained for all project's funds and
annually audited by the Commission on Audit. Assurance was obtained from the
Government (for infrastructural works) and LBP (for credit, field staff,
research, training and consultancies) that separate accounts, adequate
to reflect the purpose and use of all funds under the project, would be
maintained and annually audited by the Commission on Audit and together with
the auditor's comments and opinion be submitted to the Bank within six months
after the close of the financial year.
5.  ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Credit Operations
5.01      LBP would be responsible for implementing lending operations,
and would also assume the primary role in coordinating the various field
agencies particularly the technical extension services provided by the
Ministry of Agriculture (MA). To this end, LBP would strengthen its own
field support staff (Estate Development Coordinators) and undertake overall
planning of the proposed estate development program. More specifically, the
LBP's Field Operations Department (FOD) would take charge over the day-to-day
implementation of the project.
Land Bank Field Operations Department: Organizational Structure
5.02      Annex 5, Chart 1 shows the details relating to recent restructuring
of FOD, now being implemented. Central to this restructuring are the
establishment of FOD as a full-fledged department, the proposed creation of
Area Offices, Field Offices (Land Bank sa Bukid), strengthening of LBP's own
field support staff (Estate Development Coordinators), and formalization of
arrangements whereby MA would provide technical extension specifically in
support of LBP's activities. As a department, FOD is now under the Agrarian
Reform Section Senior Vice-President. The restructuring places FOD at a
better footing to serve the credit and other developmental needs of the small
farmers. In particular, FOD is now well constituted to enable efficient
channelling enlarged volume of resources to the small farmers, and to further
the reorientation of LBP's priorities towards this end. It is expected that
FOD will be accorded sufficient authority, manpower and financial support
commensurate with the responsibilities attendant to the project. Assurance
was obtained from LBP that the Field Operations Group, including FOD, will be
adequately staffed and annually allocated sufficient funds as would enable it



- 27 -
to efficiently implement the proposed project. Assurances were also obtained
that LBP would not materially alter internal organization with regard to
project implementation without prior consultation with the Bank.
5.03      The Area Offices, at provincial level, would concentrate on lending
operations and amortization collection; under the Area Offices and for the
same objective, would be Land Bank Sa Bukid offices (field offices) located
in truly rural areas. Estate Development Coordinators would in most cases be
responsible to a Land Bank Sa Bukid office.
5.04      The Estate Development Coordinators (EDC) would constitute the
critical level of staff, as they would be responsible for the day-to-day
implementation of the project and coordination of the activities of the other
field agencies. Their overriding responsibilities would be in financial
supervision and farm management assistance. While EDCs would endeavor to
ensure that the farmers receive the required technical assistance, the
substantive technical work relating to crops and livestock development would
be carried out by the staff assigned to the project area by MA under a
Memorandum of Agreement. The staff so provided by MA and other relevant
agencies would form a Farm Management Group (FMG) for the project area.
Assurance was obtained from the Government that MA will provide technical
field staff to project areas in accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement
between LBP and MA, and dated July 5, 1978.
Staffing and Training
5.05      Successful efforts have been made to strengthen the EDC staff
complement; and as of May 1978, 30 EDCs were at post. They are all of
suitable calibre and form a solid core which should be adequate to initiate
the implementation of the project. The number will need to be increased by
at least another 50 candidates by the third year of the project but no
serious difficulties are envisaged in recruiting this number. Efforts are
underway to recruit other critical staff and by May 1978, 20 project analysts
and credit examiners were at various stages of recruitment processing. LBP
has arranged with the University of the Philippines at Los Banos to conduct
periodic short courses for all LBP field and selected head office senior
staff; the first course took place during May 1978, lasting for two weeks.
Assurance was obtained from LBP that it would provide staff for the project
in accordance with a staffing plan acceptable to the Bank. Such a plan will
provide, inter alia, qualified and experienced EDCs to the areas of project
concentration, at an average ratio of at least one EDC to 500 farmers, and
loan appraisers and examiners in the field and branch offices sufficient to
ensure expeditious processing of loan applications.
Operation Strategies and Procedures
5.06      Estates Classification and Development Planning.   LBP has already
carried out a broad classification of all the lands acquired under the Opera-
tion Land Transfer. A number of criteria are used (See Project File, Paper
No. 2) but the general purpose is to identify the farms which have major physi-
cal (irrigation, floods, siltation, feeder roads) and institutional (agrarian



- 28 -
reform disputes and farmers organizations) problems serious enough to make
credit assistance ineffective, and those with no or only minor infrastructural
problems. The proposed project would concentrate on the latter category,
though some of the former category areas would be included under the project
components which are not seriously hampered by the infrastructural problems.
5.07      For development planning and administration, the farms are grouped
into estates, an estate being the piece of land that used to be owned by one
landlord; the estates are then zoned into farmsteads involving 300-500 farmers
and consisting of one or more contiguous and/or nearby estates. Each
estate would have a master, and an annual, development plan and budget worked
out by the EDC in consultatiion with FMG and the farmers. The plans will
constitute the basis for production credit and sub-projects to be financed
by the proposed project; they would also enable LBP to determine areas where
lending for farm machinery and post-harvest facilities would not create or
aggravate excess capacity. Assurance was obtained from LBP that prior
to financing farm machineries and post-harvest facilities, LBP will ensure
that conveniently available capacity is adequately utilized.
5.08      Lending Operations.  A major consideration for loan qualification
would be the capacity to service the loan, taking into account other indebted-
ness and financial obligations of the would-be borrower. All loan applica-
tions would be assessed against the master development plan for the concerned
estate. The FOD would be allocated funds annually according to the planned
program under the proposed project and would have full authority in the
detailed use and disbursement of these funds. The Area Office would have
authority to approve loans of up to P 100,000, while the Field Office (Land
Bank Sa Bukid) would approve up to P 25,000; EDC's would have lending
authority for individual loans of P 5,000 or less.
5.09      Group borrowing would be encouraged, particularly on the items for
which the economic capacity is beyond the scope of the individual farmer.
Disbursements would be made directly to the suppliers for most farm inputs, as
well as machinery and equipment. Annex 5, Appendix A, contains the terms and
conditions which would govern sublending for term credit. Assurance was
obtained from LBP that these terms and conditions of lending will not be
materially altered or abrogated without prior approval by the Bank. Loans to
individual borrowers would bear interest of not less than 12% p.a. This is
comparable to rates charged on similar loans by other institutions in the
Philippines and, with an expected inflation rate of 8% p.a. over the next
three years, would yield a positive real interest rate.
5.10     Loan repayments would be in cash, except that in some cases repayment
in kind may be undertaken for grains through collection arrangements with the
National Grains Authority (NGA) or its agents. An interest penalty of 2% p.a.
would apply for all past dues, except when repayment has been rescheduled for
reasons such as natural calamities. All rice production loans would be
covered by the newly formed Philippines Crop Insurance Corporation (see
Project File Paper No. 9).



- 29 -
B. Minor Infrastructural Works
5.11      The overall planning, coordinating and implementing of the minor
infrastructural works would be the responsibility of the national Committee on
Infrastructural Development for Agrarian Reform Estates (CIDARE) /1 and its
provincial bodies (see Project File Paper No. 3). A Memorandum of Agreement
has been signed by LBP and each of the agencies responsible for carrying out
the various works envisaged under the project. LBP, through its EDCs, would
undertake the general identification of the works. Initial feasibility work
would be done by the field officer of the relevant agency, and proposals
submitted to the CIDARE. Detailed planning and execution would be done by the
relevant line agency.
5.12      The funding would be from Government's budgetary allocations, as
recommended by CIDARE and approved by the Budget Commission, directly to the
appropriate line agency. Assurance was obtained from the Government
that counterpart funds, as recommended by CIDARE and approved by the Budget
Commission, would be made available to the executing agency.
C. Research and Studies
5.13      This would be undertaken by the University of the Philippines at
Los Banos (Centre of Policy and Development Studies - CPDS) under a contract
signed in May, 1978 with LBP in consultation with Bank staff. CPDS would also
provide consulting service to LBP on monitoring and evaluation and project
implementation. The contract is for three years during which time it is
expected that LBP staff, as they gain experience and expertise, would gradually
assume full responsibility for these functions. Assurance was obtained from
LBP that terms of reference and terms of employment relating to research and
consultancy tasks would be submitted to the Bank for evaluation and approval.
D. Monitoring and Evaluation
5.14     LBP would strengthen its monitoring and evaluation capacity, partly
through increased staffing (EDCs) and more so through the consultancy services
by the University of the Philippines (see para. 5.13). In addition to under-
taking baseline surveys on economic and financial conditions of the farmers,
EDCs would carry out periodic household surveys with a view to determining
the incremental benefit to the project's sub-borrowers, and establishing as
well as updating input-output coefficients, identifying the major constraints
and monitoring the progress of the project. Assurance was obtained from
/1  The Committee's membership consists of: LBP (providing secretariat
services); Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR); Department of Local
Government and Community Development (DLGCD); National Irrigation Authority
(NIA); Bureau of Public Highways (BPH); Department of Public Works (DPW);
and Budget Commission. CIDARE functions are: facilitation, identification,
preparation, funding and implementation, coordinating and monitoring all
infrastructural works pertaining to the agrarian reform areas.



- 30 -
LBP that it will carry out, in a manner, scope and form to be agreed with the
Bank, monitoring and evaluation of the project activities, and submit reports
thereof to the Bank.
6. MARKETING AND PRICES
Marketing
6.01     Grains.   Rice consumption in the Philippines is expected to
increase at about 3.5% in the foreseeable future, and the country is not
likely to attain sustainable self-sufficiency before the mid-1980s. Reliance
on imported feed grains for the expanding livestock and poultry industries
will continue beyond that time. No difficulties are therefore envisaged
regarding the absorption of incremental grain production generated by the
project.
6.02     Livestock and Poultry Products.  The domestic market would also
readily absorb the increased production of meat and eggs, in part as import
substitutes but more so as a result of increased demand arising from population
growth and improvements in per capita income. In the case of broiler produc-
tion for large urban markets, it would be an essential part of sub-loan eval-
uation to establish satisfactory market tie-ups such as those now existing in
many cases through integrated commercial operations; similar importance would
be placed on the marketing aspects of vegetables in areas where production is
likely to be substantial.
6.03     Cottage Industries.   Most of the products would be marketed locally,
and care would be exercised regarding the possible over-supply of certain
items, especially concrete products, the demand for which has tended to
fluctuate widely in sympathy with the construction sector. Export prospects
for various handicraft products are fairly bright for sales to the USA, Europe
and Japan, as well as local sales through tourist outlets.
Prices
6.04     The prevailing grain prices, especially for rice and corn, approximate
the world prices. However, although the seasonal variation of the officialy
quoted prices for rice and corn has dampened during the last three years, the
actual farmgate prices are characterized by a wider amplitude, partly as a
result of heavier sales immediately after harvesting and the higher moisture
content due to the lack of proper drying facilities. The prices of the other
commodities to be produced under the project are generally satisfactory.
Table 11 shows the set of current prices applied in the financial and economic
evaluation of the principal project components and projected prices based on
the Bank's latest indications.

7. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
General
7.01      The project would be exclusively directed towards the lower strata
of small-scale farmers and rural entrepreneurs with focus on beneficiaries of
the on-going agrarian reform program. Due to high risks conventionally
associated with small-scale credit, these farmers have hitherto been left out
of the mainstream of institutional credit in general and term credit in
particular; furthermore they have not been provided with sufficient technical
and managerial assistance to make effective use of such facilities. They
have historically depended on the landlords and other sources of noninstitu-
tional credit for a wide range of needs. They will now be increasingly
severed from the support they have been getting from the landlords, and an
effective substitute must be made available to these farmers.
7.02      The majority of project beneficiaries live below or on the verge of
the poverty line (see para. 2.03).  While the adjustment period from tenant
to owner-cultivator may be fraught with difficulties, the long-term benefits
are likely to be substantial. But, as experience has shown elsewhere, the
realization of these benefits may be aborted or unduly delayed in the absence
of dedicated and rigorous efforts to provide the external resources that these
farmers need to fully exploit the agricultural potential of the land and
other resources already at their disposal. The Land Bank of the Philippines
is statutorily and operationally committed to undertake such efforts and has
demonstrated a commendable degree of proficiency in its initial activities
directed to this segment of the population.
Production
7.03      As Table 12 illustrates, the project would generate a significant
increase in production of goods and services, especially rice, well in
keeping with the national policy of self-sufficiency and improved living
standards in the rural areas. The cottage industries would provide widened
employment opportunities as well as enhancing the supply of consumer and
industrial goods, some of which have fairly good prospects for export. The
project would also increase the availability of services (rice milling,
transportation, and marketing) essential in the agricultural development
process. Additionally, the project would improve infrastructural facilities
/1 and farm mechanization,/2 the costs and benefits of which have been
incorporated in rice production financial and economic analysis for purposes
of this report.
/1 About 120 km of feeder roads, irrigation rehabilitation for about 4,100 ha,
and flood control for about 2,700 ha.
/2 Irrigation pumps for about 7,100 ha, power tillers for about 15,300 ha,
threshers for about 34.6 thousand tons of paddy, and driers for about
92.5 thousand tons of paddy.

by the family labor, total incremental value of cropping intensity over and

the lessened drudgery of the farm work. Estimated cash flows and financial
rates of returns for the various subprojects are presented in Project Paper
No. 4, Tables 1-15, and summarized below:

Aggregate Financial and Economic Rates of Return
7.05      Table 14 below shows the estimated aggregate financial and economic
rates of return for the principal categories of the subprojects (see Project
File, Paper No. 5 for details). The financial rates range from 23.2% for
cattle to over 100% for piggeries, chickens and ducks, while the economic
rates range from 14% for cattle to over 100% for most of the other subproject
categories. The economic rate of return for the project as a whole, exclusive
of research and consultancy costs, is about 47%. However, this figure must be
viewed in the context of weather-related and project-related risk (paras. 7.12-
7.14).

Employment Impact
7.06      The project would create incremental employment rising from
300 man-years in the first year to about 11,900 man-years in the sixth year
(see Annex 6, Table 1). Although farm mechanization, especially the power
tillers for land preparation, would reduce the overall labor inputs for rice
cultivation during the first and the second year, the reduction would be more
than offset in subsequent years by increased cropping intensity and higher
rice yield facilitated by the expansion of irrigation and increased farm
inputs; furthermore, hired labor would increase as a result of the general
inclination on the part of the farmers to hire more labor as credit is made
available. This would directly benefit the mounting number of landless as
well as farmers with land holdings too small to provide full employment
during the peak seasons. Virtually all the employment opportunities created
by the project are for unskilled labor and would therefore be available to
the rural poor.
Public Revenues Impact
7.07      Annex 6, Table 2 shows details on the estimated impact that the
project would have on the public revenues as summarized in Table 15 here
below. The incremental net public primarily revenues would reach a deficit of
P 7.3 million during the third year (mainly because of the infrastructural
works relating to feeder roads, irrigation and flood control), transforming
into a surplus of P 11.8 million in fourth year and settling to an annual
level of P 9.8 million in the fifth year. The cumulative deficit would be
recovered in the fifth year and a surplus of P 14.1 million would be
attained during the sixth year.

Foreign Exchange Impact
7.08      The Philippines has been a net importer of rice, until last year,
and corn. It is estimated that the country may reach sustainable self-
sufficiency by mid-1980 (see para. 1.06) for rice but much later for corn and
feed grains. In the interim, there would be periodic net imports of rice and
persistent imports of corn. Rice and corn produced under the proposed
project would therefore result in savings of foreign exchange expenditures.
At full development (3rd year), the project would generate incremental rice
production valued at P 96.6 million and corn production valued at P 1.0 million
FOB Manila. Furthermore, opportunities exist for export of fibercraft and to
a lesser extent charcoal from the cottage industries financed by the project.
The total foreign exchange expenditure is estimated at P 86.7 million
during the development period (see Table 9) while the recurrent expenditures
(mostly fuel, spare parts, fertilizers and agro-chemicals) are estimated at
P 34.1 million at full development. Thus, the project will result in a
recurrent net surplus of P 63.7 million in terms of foreign exchange at
full development.
Institutional Impact
7.09      General Operations.  The project would reinforce the recent initia-
tives taken by LBP to make its agricultural credit delivery and recovery
system more responsive to the needs of the lower strata of the small-scale
farmers. It would provide the financial and institutional framework for a
coordinated effort among various agencies to address the peculiar needs of
this group. It is expected that the strenthening of the LBP field support
staff would appreciably enhance its overall credit delivery and recovery
capabilities and its capacity to promote sound farm management practices.
7.10      Financial Impact on Land Bank.  Annex 7, Tables 1 shows LBP's
estimated income and expenses (on accrual basis) arising from the project, as
summarized in Table 16 here below. On accrual basis, the project would have
a favorable impact on the earnings of LBP.

Year 1 Year 2   Year 3  Year 4  Year 5  Year 6  Year 7  Year 8

Operating Expenses  (2.3)       5.8     20.2    23.3      9.0      5.1    2.0       0.8
Financial Costs      (4.7)      0.1       9.2     7.7      0.5     5.0    2.0       0.8
Bad debts:           (5.6)    (2.4)      4.1      4.5    (0.8)    4.9    1.9        0.1
Cumulative         (5.6)    (8.0)    (3.9)    0.6    (0.2)    4.7    6.6          6.7
Debt-Servicing Ratio  1.9:1   4.3:1        5.3:1   3.1:1   1.8:1      -       -        -
Including an allowance for bad debts at 3% of loans granted, net income
would be in a deficit during the first two years and the fifth year (if
seasonal credit is discontinued); cumulatively, the deficit would be recovered
in the sixth year and a surplus of P 6.7 million attained in the eighth
year. The debt-service ratio would remain satisfactory throughout the
period under consideration.
7.11      Annex 7, Table 2 presents the cash flow on an accrual basis while
Table 3 presents it assuming an annual collection (for both principal and
interest earnings) of 55% for three years with the uncollected balances
written off in the fourth year; this gives an effective collection rate of
about 91% of total loans and compares with LBP's achievement of 94.0% in 1976
and 92.5% in 1977 for agricultural loans (see Table 7). The following
summarizes the two cases:
Table 17: CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS ARISING FROM THE PROJECT
(PI million)

Accrual Basis    0.5    7.1    18.8        14.7    49.9   22.9    12.9       6.9     0.1

/a  After offsetting against IBRD Loan P 25.1 million repaid by the term credit
subproj ects.



- 38 -
In either case the cash flow to LBP would remain satisfactory. However, at
the effective collection rate of 91%, the debt write-off would place a
burden on the LBP resources as it would amount to nearly P 33.6 million.
Given the average 7.7% cost of the project's funds, LBP cannot sustain a
write-off much in excess of 5% of outstanding loans without incurring
losses and erosion of the loanable funds. It is expected that the streng-
thening of the LBP field staff under the project would help to obviate
unbearable default rates.
Project Risks
7.12      The main factors which might impinge on the success of the project
are: the present high level of delinquency among rural borrowers; difficul-
ties encountered by field extension services in stimulating increased crop
yields; and, the limited experience of LBP and other agencies in the Philippines
in packaging and supervising a program expressly for small farmers.
7.13      The first two types of risks are interdependent to the extent
that low yields reduce repayment capacity; this underscores the critical
importance of field support services and it is expected that both of these
risks would be substantially reduced by the proposed measures to strengthen
the LBP's field staff and coordinate the efforts of other agencies. The
separation of the FOD from commercial banking functions to concentrate wholly
on loan delivery and collection should appreciably help in maintaining high
collection rates.
7.14      In partial recognition of low yield risks, the project has adopted
a yield of 75 cavans/ha (3.75 tons) for rice as compared to in 80 cavans/ha
(4 tons) generally thought attainable, and used in the analysis of other Bank-
financed projects in the Philippines. With respect to LBP's implementation
capacity, the scope of the project has intentionally been kept modest and
is within the existing and programmed capabilities of LBP. While we foresee
no significant increase in the pace of agrarian reform, there are already
37.6 thousand farmers cultivating 71,400 ha who have acquired land ownership
through the program, as compared to the 27,600 estimated project beneficiaries,
some of whom would be nonagrarian reform farmers. Accordingly, the progress
of the agrarian reform program would not affect the proposed project.
8. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      Assurances were obtained from the Government that:
(a) the Ministry of Agriculture (MA) would provide technical field staff
to project areas in accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement
signed between LBP and MA, and dated July 5, 1978 (para. 5.04); and
(b) counterpart funds would be made available, as recommended by CIDARE
and approved by the Budget Commission, to the line agencies
responsible for the infrastructural works under the project
(para. 5.12).



- 39 -
8.02      Assurances were obtained from LBP that:
(a)  LBP would not materially alter its internal organization  with
regard to project implementation without prior consultation with
the Bank (para. 5.02);
(b)  LBP would adequately staff its field offices in accordance with
a staffing program satisfactory to the Bank (para. 5.05);
(c)  prior to financing farm machinery and post-harvest facilities,
LBP would ensure that conveniently available capacity is adequately
utilized (para. 5.07); and
(d)  terms and conditions of term credit subloans would not be materially
altered or abrogated without approval by the Bank (para. 5.09).
8.03      Retroactive financing of up to US$120,000 is recommended for expenses
incurred on training, vehicles and research contracts (see para. 4.11).
8.04      Subject to the above assurances, the proposed project is suitable
for a Bank loan of US$16.5 million for a period of 20 years, including a
grace period of 5 years.

SMALL FARMERS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
LAND BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES
PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Field Operations Department (FOD): Organizational Structure
1.-       Table 1 hereto shows the reorganized structure of FOD now being
implemented, effective May 1978. At the Head Office level, FOD would remain
essentially the same, the only changes being: separating it from the purely
commercial banking operations; upgrading it to a full-fledged department with
loan approving powers; and moving it from the general management and admin-
istration section to the agrarian reform section. Its seven divisions would
remain the same, with the responsibilities of the Facilities and Supplies
Division, Communications, Records and Manpower Division, and Accounting and
Statistics Division being as suggested by the respective names. The Field
Services Division would be primarily responsible for loans and amortization
collection (in areas not covered by the branches or Area Offices), land
transfer documentation and infrastructural problems in agrarian reform areas.
The Estates Development Division's functions would include: monitoring and
evaluation of the lending program, technical backstopping and training of the
field staff, and promotion of farmers organizations. However, at the field
level, FOD would be radically restructured with a view to sharpening its
focus and making it more responsive to the developmental needs of the small-
scale agriculture.
2.        Area and Field Offices.  Area Offices would be established more or
less on provincial basis (sharing facilities with existing branch banks or
otherwise located separately if no existing branch banks are conveniently
situated for the purposes of Area Offices) as the volume of expected business
warrants. Freed from preoccupation with purely commercial banking considera-
tions, their primary functions would be to serve the developmental credit
needs of the smallholders, and to undertake loan and amortization collections.
Under Area Offices would be the Land Bank Sa Bukid (Field Offices) located in
truly rural areas (barrios), and furthering, at the grass root level, the
development reorientation of the field activities; they would focus exclusive
on the lending operation but would also seek to encourage savings among the
smallholders. Although both the Area and Field Offices would assume collection
as one of their major activities, the organizational structure is designed to
ensure a good measure of separation between the collection and the develop-
mental field personnel.
3.        Farmstead Offices:  (EDCs Offices).  These would be manned by the
Estate Development Coordinators, each being responsible for 300-500 farmers.
They would come directly under the Field Offices on all matters relating to
credit delivery and recovery and under Area offices (Estate Development
Division) in all non-financial developmental matters. The EDC would be the



- 53 -                              ANNEX 5
Page 2
most critical LBP's link with the farmers and other field agencies and his
effectiveness would bear strongly on the success of the proposed project, as
he would be responsible for the day-to-day project implementation functions
and coordinating the work of the other field agencies especially MA's extension
staff.
4.        The main functions of an EDC are:  providing overall financial
planning and management, activating and coordinating the activities of the
other field agencies, especially MA; identifying the constraints facing the
farmers and referring them to the appropriate line agencies, assisting the
farmers in farm planning and budgeting, procurement of inputs and marketing
of the produce; establishing and maintaining appropriate economic and social
data; and, by virtue of his intimate knowledge of the farmers, assisting in
screening borrowers and helping to ensure that LBPs policies reflect the real
conditions facing the farmers.
5.        Farm Management Groups (FMG).  These would consist of the field
technical staff, especially MA's extension staff, designated by the various
agencies /1 to support LBP's field activities. The EDCs would work hand in
hand with the Farm Management Group and while EDCs would assume the leading
role in ensuring that adequate technical services are made available to the
farmers, the substantive technical work would be provided by the technical
agencies' members of the FMG. To this end, LBP and the agencies have already
signed a Memoranda of Agreement under which the agencies would provide the
required technical support. The farmers would be organized into groups of
15-20 under the general leaders of one of them (the Farmers Group Leader -
FGL). The Farmers Groups would constitute the operational units with regard
to credit delivery, supply of farm inputs and marketing of the produce, and
the focal point of the extension services. The FGL would serve as the
liaison person between the farmers and FMG in general and EDC in particular.
Staffing and Training
6.        The following table shows the staff situation directly relevant to
FOD's activities:
/1 The Ministry of Agriculture (MA); the National Irrigation Authority
(NIA); the Ministry of Agrarian Reform (MAR); the Ministry of Local
Government and Community Development (MLCD); Ministry of Public Highway
(MPH); etc.

/a  Refers to LBP total requirement, not restricted to the needs of the
proposed project.
7.        The general shortage of staff is apparent from the above table,
especially at the field level. However, for the immediate future, the
creation of FOD, a separate department would largely involve redeploy-
ment of the existing staff. At the field level, most of the immediate
staff needs would be filled by staff already in the branches. As far as the
proposed project is concerned, the critical staff would be the EDCs, loan
appraisers and examiners whose number must be increased as the project
expands. With regard to EDCs, 12 were at post during 1977 and 18 more were
recruited during the first quarter of 1978, thus giving a total of 30. The
calibre of the present EDCs is satisfactory. The proposed project requires
about 13 EDCs during the first year, 27 during the second year, and 50 during
the third year (based on 300 subprojects per EDC). No serious problems are
anticipated in securing this number of staff. With regard to the other
critical staff, recruitment efforts are well underway to ensure that the staff



- 55 -                                 ANNEX 5
Page 4
will be at post in keeping with the needs of the project. As of May 1978,
additional 20 project analysts and appraisers were at various stages of
recruitment processing: 3 of them just appointed, 5 awaiting Board's approval,
and 12 pending security clearance; this would be more than strictly required
for the project's activities in the immediate future.
8.        LBP has already contracted with the University of the Philippines
(Centre for Policy and Development Studies) for the training of the field
staff with particular reference to EDCs, branches, area and field office
managers. The first training course, lasting four weeks, was held in May-June
1978 for a total of 25 EDCs. It is intended to organize periodic courses
relevant to all the middle management personnel of LBP including operational
managers, project supervisers, credit investigators, and project analysts,
and selected farmers and farmers' group leaders. The training would be
conducted by both the LBPs senior staff and University staff specialized in
various disciplines.
Lending Operations
9.        The conditions and terms of lending would remain consistent with
the LBPs approved practices (see Annex 5, Appendix A), and a Field Operations
Manual would be made available to all the field staff.

periods shall apply only to the principal portion of the loan, and the maximum
maturity period stipulated in para 3.04 shall include any such grace period.
3.06      Interest Rates and Other Charges
(a) Interest Rates

of not less than 12%.
(ii) all interest charges shall be determined on the basis of the
outstanding balance of the sub-loan from time to time.
(b) Service Fees
An annual service fee of 2% of the outstanding balance, subject to a

(c) Processing fees shall be collected from all applicants for loans in
accordance with prevailing Land Bank regulations.
(d) Penalty charges in accordance with Land Bank regulations shall be
paid on all unpaid amortizations or portions thereof that remain
past due for more than 60 days. Such charges shall be in addition
to regular interest charges.
(e) In the event of a suit for collection of an unpaid balance of a
subloan, an attorney's fees shall be collected in accordance with
prevailing Land Bank regulations.
3.07      Insurance/Guarantee Coverage
(a) As available, short-term production loans shall be covered by
guarantee or insurance on production losses from the appropriate
agency, the coverage of which shall be the maximum coverage avail-
able.
(b) In the case of commodity loans, evidence shall be required that
the stipulated place of deposit possesses adequate insurance

Section IV - Sub-loan Releases
4.01      Upon documentation and registration of the loan documents, the loan
proceeds shall be released in accordance with the approved loan application,
Project Plan and Budget. Where more than one release is specified, subsequent
releases shall only be allowed upon certification of an authorized representa-
tive of the Land Bank as to actual need and as to the use of previous releases
in strict accordance with the terms and conditions of the approved loan.
Should there be a need to deviate from the approved schedule and amount of
releases, a justification and recommendation to that effect from any
authorized representative of the Bank favorably acted upon by the authorized
approving authority, shall be required.
4.02      In the case of loans involving machinery and material inputs,
the loan proceeds shall not be released to the sub-borrower but instead
Purchase Orders shall be issued in his favor to effect the delivery and
purchase from the designated supplier. For any individual purchase estimate
to cost P 10,000 or more, the request shall be accompanied by at least three
price quotations from local suppliers.
Section V - Sub-loan Repayment
5.01      Term loans shall be amortized  in equal payments monthly, quarterly,
semi-annually or annually as fixed by the Land Bank on the basis of anticipated
sub-project cash flow. In no case shall the interval between installments
exceed 12 months.
5.02      In the case of loans pertaining to palay production, it is the
policy of the Land Bank that marketing tie-ups be entered into by and between
the borrower and on Area Marketing Cooperative or other Bank-designated
marketing outlet, the latter establishments to serve both as a marketing and
collection arm of the program. Sub-borrowers are thereby required to deliver
and deposit all their marketable produce (that which has been partly or
wholly financed by the Land Bank) to the AMC or accredited outlets for
marketing. As soon as the deposited produce is marketed by the trading
outlets, the amount corresponding to that due to the Land Bank on account of
the sub-loan shall be remitted by the seller to the Bank. Sales proceeds in
excess of the sub-borrower's current obligations to the Bank shall be sub-
sequently disbursed to the sub-borrowers concerned.
Section VI - Restructuring of Loans Affected by Calamities
6.01      The restructuring of sub-loans may be justified whenever loss or
damage results from fortuitous events or force majeure, i.e., typhoons,
earthquakes, or other cause of loss/damage verified to fall beyond the control
of man. Such restructuring shall consist of the granting of an appropriate
extension period on the maturity date of the sub-loan in the case of short-term
production loans, or of one or more installments in the case of term loans.
The Land Bank may also provide, depending on need and repayment capacity,



- 64 -                           ANNEX 5
Appendix A
Page 9
additional financing for the purpose of rehabilitating the sub-project to the
extent of substantial recovery. However, both rescheduling of maturity dates
and the provision of additional financing shall be subject to confirmation by
the Land Bank of the continued earning capacity of the project sufficient to
service the debt so restructured.
6.02      As a matter of policy, however, the extension periods that are to
be granted under normal conditions shall not exceed the equivalent of the
original maturity periods of the affected sub-loans or installments. Moreover,
amounts to be granted for the purpose of refinancing, if any, shall be limited
to actual and reasonable needs for rehabilitation taking into consideration
