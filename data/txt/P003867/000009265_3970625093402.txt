SECOND EAST JAVA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrrower        Republic of Indonesia
Beneficiaries:   Thirteen water enterprises located in the Province of East
Java, and Ministry of Public Works' Directorate General of
Human Settlements (Cipta Karya).
Amount:          US$43.3 milLion equivalent
Terms:           Repayable in 20 years, including five years grace, at the
standard variable rate. ODI vill assume the foreign exchange
risk.
ReLending Terms: Part of the proceeds of the IBRD Loan (US$12.7 million
equivalent) would be onlent by the Governmnt to PDAM
Surabaya, repayable in 25 years including five years of
grace, at 11-12= interest.
Project
Description:   The proposed project would benefit about 1.2 million persons
in a wide range of urban and semi-rural comu8ities
throughout the East Java Province, with particular emphasis
on low income groups. It would support the Government of
Indonesia's water sector development and investment program
in conformity with Repelita IV targets through: (a) provid-
ing low-cost water production and distribution to about 75
small and medium sized towns in the East Java Province; (b)
expanding and rehabilitating the water supply system in the
provincial capital of Surabaya; (c) providing technical
assistance to new and recently established water entities for
improved operation and system expansion; (d) strengthening
provincial level capability in planning and implementing
water supply investment programs, water pollution control,
and monitoring and development of water entities'
performance; and (e) providing technical assistance for
preparing future water supply projects and determining
appropriate water supply organization arrangements in three
provinces.
Risks            The primary risk is that a part of the revenue from smaller
IKKs (population less than about 5,000) may be slow in
materializing. However, (a) the volume of water and revenues
involved are very small and (b) the experience under the
First East Js.va Water Supply Project (Loan 2275-IND)
indicates t}at connections, water sales and revenues are
ahead of szhedule.

I. WATER SUPPLY SECTOR
A. Background
1.01      Population.  Indonesia is the fifth most populous country in the world
with more than 155 million people (1984) on 13,000 islands. The average popula-
tion density is 83 persons/sq km, but in East Java (the Province in which the
proposed Project is located) it is 657, one of the highest in the world. With
30 million people, the province has 20Z of Indonesia's population and 2Z of its
land area. Indonesia's population is increasing at an average annual rate of
about 2.1Z and in Java (excluding Jakarta) the rate is 1.92. About 22% of the
national population lives in urban areas which are growing at 3.7Z per annum.
Eleven percent of East Java's population reside in the eight self-governing
cities (Kotamadya). The largest of these, Surabaya, has 2.2 million people and
is, after Jakarta, Indonesia's second largest city.
1.02      Administration.  Indonesia has 27 provinces which are divided into 216
districts (Kabupatens), and these in turn are divided into about 3,300 sub-
districts (Kecamatan). There are 54 autonomous cities (Kotamadya), about 3,300
district t,wns (Ibu Kota Kecamatan), and about 65,000 villages (Desa). East
Java Province has 29 Kabupatens, 8 Kotamadyas, 554 Kecamatans, and 8,260 Desas.
1.03      Health.  As measured by standard indices, health conditions in
Indonesia lag behind those in other countries at a similar stage of economic
development. At the end of the 1970s, life expectancy in Indonesia was
53 years, whiLe the average for other low and middle-income countries was 57 and
61 years, respectively. The average infant mortality rate was estimated at 102
per 1,000 births compared to about 55 in the Philippines and Thailand, and 32 in
Malaysia. Endemic diseases, caused principally by poor water supply and
sanitation, are major factors behind these statistics.
1.04      Water Resources.  Indonesia is well endowed with rainfall and ground
and surface water resources, but problems of distance, reliability, contamina-
tion, excessive demand and conflicting uses hinder simple and rapid development
on a wide scale. Because of population density, intensive agriculture and above
average industrialization and urbanization, the water supply situation in Java
is more critical than in other parts of Indonesia and the estimated 1990 demand
represents 98Z of the available supply in Java. Household and industrial water
requirements are about 10% and agricultural needs about 90Z of total needs.
Exploitation of the remaining feasible surface water impoundments and
groundwater sources, together with improved irrigation efficiency, careful
allocation of supplies and enforcement of pollution controls are needed to
conserve Java's water resources to serve future growth adequately.
B. Sector Service Levels
1.05      About 45% of the urban population had access to piped water supply in
1983. Huch of this suffers from contamination, low pressure, and intermittent
supply. A considerable portion of the urban population is dependent on water
from vendors or from shallow wells, streams or rivers at considerable health
risk. About a quarter (26%) of the urban and rural population is considered to



-2-
have satisfactory sanitation facilities. Of the rural population, only 20X have
access to potable water from either piped systems, vells with handpumps, central
rainwater collectors or protected springs. The remaining 80Z obtain water from
unprotected streams, springs or wells. While the present situation is
unsatisfactory, there has been considerable improvement in water supply over the
period 1970-1983 during which the percentage of total population served has
risen from 2.5Z to 26Z. However, due to population growth the absolute number
of people without access to safe water has remained almost the same at 118
million in 1970 as against 117 million in 1983.

C. Sector Institutions
1.06      Several ministries of the Government of Indonesia (GOI) are respon-
sible for the water supply, sewerage and sanitation sector. The Ministry of
Public Works (MPW) is responsible for development in urban areas and the
Ministry of Health for water quality monitoring and for water supply in rural
areas. The Ministry of Home Affairs (Departemen Dalam Negeri (DDN)) by virtue
of its responsibility for local government and local government enterprises, is
indirectly responsible for overseeing operations. Water and sanitation systems
are owned aid operated by local governments, either as a department (a Dinas),
or as a semi-antonomous water enterprise (Perusahan Daerah Air Minum (PDAN).
The sector organization is shown in Figure A. Within the MPW, the responsibil-
ity for planning and implementation of all water supply and sanitation projects
lies under the Directorates of Programming (Bina Program) and Water Supply
(Direktorate Air Bersih, i.e. DAB) in the Directorate General of Human
Settlements (Cipta Karya (CK)). During the period of construction the DAB and
CK provide technical and managerial assistance to water supply utilities and



-3-
temporarily operate them until they become PDAMs on achieving sufficient
revenues to cover cash operating expenses. At present they operate about 80
such temporary organizations (known as Badan Pengelola Air Minum (BPAH)).
D. GOI's Sector Development Policies
1.07      During REPELITAs I and II (covering 1969-79), total capital investment
in the sector was close to Rp 182 billion. The initial emphasis was on water
production which increased from 9,000 litres per second (lIs) to 21,000 I/s. In
1979, as EEPELITA II was drawing to a close, it was recognized that the pace of
development needed to be accelerated, and that for equity considerations the
smaller cities and towns and the poor of those places must be accorded prio-
rity. Therefore, during REPELITA III (1979-1984) the government embarked upon a
'basic needs' approach to projects which sought to provide essential service
rapidly, at low-cost. Under the impetus of the UN International Drinking Water
and Sanitation Decade overall service level targets were set by GOI in 1981 for
1990 for urban and rural water supply to serve 70% and 602 of the total
population, respectively. Two major programmes for urban water supply in the
1980s are the Basic Needs Approach (BNA) programme for cities and larger towns
(with populations 20,000 and up), and the Ibu Kota Kecamatan (IKK) programme for
kecamatan headquarter towns with populations in the 3,000-20,000 range (Annex
2). Investment during REPELITA III amounted to some Rp 360 billion, of which
Rp 300 billion was in urban projects and Rp 60 billion in rural projects. In
terms of water production, the REPELITA III targets were achieved; capacity
increased to over 30,000 l/s, however, the distribution network has lagged far
behind. The overall picture for the end of REPELITA III is presented in Annex 1
Table A.1.5.  REPELITA IV, which commenced in 1984, will continue basic BNA and
IKK policies with special emphasis ra Category 4 towns (20,000 to 100,000
population) as well as larger citie- . The preliminary investment programme for
REPELITA IV amounts to some Rp 880 billion for water supply, representing about
0.2Z of GNP per annum.
1.08      Sector Financing and Cost Recovery.  The investment required to meet
the 1990 urban water supply target for Indonesia is estimated to be about US$
1.8 billion (1984 prices), or US$ 365 million per year for the remaining years
of the decade. While the target is unlikely to be met because of implementation
capacity constraints, investment is still expected to be substantial. Due to
its stringent resource position, GOI is giving increasing emphasis to cost
recovery from users and has set a clear financing policy based on level of
service.  According to GOI policy, basic needs systems (defined as those wh4
provide up to 60 l/c/d on average for up to 60% of the population) wctd be
financed by central government grants; systems providing 60-125 l/c/d, with a
mix of central government loans (current interest rate 12%), grants and internal
cash generation; and systems for more than 125 I/c/d, by central governments
loans and internal cash generation only. Based on this principle GOI requires
every PDAM to at least generate funds for operations maintenance and
depreciation while maintaining affordability; and requires increasing self-
financing from PDAMs providing higher level of service. This implies
progressive cost recovery in the sense that as the consumption increases,
contribution from beneficiaries will increase. Consultants engaged under Loan
2275-IND, and Bank staff have been reviewing the Lurrent financing policy,
including a national water rate structure, and have endorsed GOI's approach as
realistic in the present stage of development of water systems.

E. Experience with Past Bank Lending
1.09      Experience with previous urban and water supply projects has been good
on balance.  The Bank has made three loans to GOI for water supply projects,
including two which cover a total of 12 cities and another for development of
13 BNA and 37 IKK systems in Fast Java.  As indicated in the Project Completion
Report for the Five Cities Water Supply Project (Loan 1049-IND), physical
targets in most cases have been met generally within budget, although with some
delays, and CK is evolving to become a well-organized and forceful development
agency; responsive to sector and project issues and forward looking. The main
problems evident are (i) limited implementation capacity and (ii) weaknesses in
local government organization and procedures, and scarce trained manpower and
locally generated financial resources, which have often lead to operational
difficulties. Lack of monitoring of PDAM operations has been identified as a
key problem. PDAH operations suffer in some cases from large proportions of
unaccounted-for-water, operating losses, poor collection of bills, large
accounts receivable (particularly from Government agencies) and inadequate
audit. Resolution of such institutional problems is partly the responsibility
of DDN, itself a relatively poorly equipped organization for development
purposes. These problems are being addressed through the first East Java Water
Supply Project (Loan 2275-IND) and under the proposed project. Measures to
strengthen local government management and finances are being supported through
various Bank-supported urban projects.
1.10      Following experience with the logistical and management difficulties
of nation-wide projects, GOI has recognized the need for a more systematic
approach to matching of its considerable investment and institutional develop-
ment requirements with the various financing and donor agencies capabilities.
It therefore requested that the Bank should focus its subsequent attention
initially on one province, East Java, with the objectives of (a) providing water
to all communities with a population of 3,000 or more; and (b) achieving an
institutional development model for replication in other provincial and regional
water supply schemes. The ongoing first East Java Water Supply Project is
therefore mainly concerned with the planning, design and implementation of BNA
and IKK water supply systems in East Java and with institutional development.
Systems in 50 towns utilizing innovative technology, intended to provide low
cost, safe water supply to about 720,000 persons, are being implemented under
this project which is in its early stages and progressing satisfactorily.
Institutional development under Loan 2275 includes the developing and
strengthening of project PDAMs, CK (including DAB and the water supply sectoral
training programmes), and a study of water enterprise operations and finances.
The institutional studies are being funded under a co-financing agreement
between the Bank and the Australian Government.
F. Urban Water Supply Objectives, Issues and Constraints
1.11      The Government's urban water supply objective is to provide by 1990
adequate water supplies to 70% of the urban population. It would do this by
continuing the BNA and IKK Programmes (para. 1.07) and placing particular empha-
sis on improving operational capabilities of the agencies concerned, through
training of water supply staff, public health education, and upgrading the
capabilities of local consultants, civil works contractors and suppliers.



-5-
Issues and Constraints
1.12      Implementation Capacity.  In common with many other GOI agencies, CK
is experiencing increasing difficulties in implementing its groving development
programs on time.  In CK's case, many of its difficulties stem from the logisti-
cally complex nature of the sector irvolving numerous local authorities spread
over a wide geographic area, as well as restrictive central budgetary and pro-
curement procedures and manpower shortages. As a result, CK is moving toward
decentralization of its project operations to provincial-level agencies, and has
recently established project management units in East Java and elsewhere, with
delegated responsibility for many proj;ct preparation and implementation func-
tions. Other functions such as planning and programming of CK activities are
scheduled to be introduced at the provincial level shortly. The effectiveness
of decentralization will depend, however, on the training of adequate manpower
as well as the development of appropriate systems, for which extensive consult-
ant support is to be provided in the meantime.
1.13      Personnel Requirements for the Urban Water Programme.  At the end of
1982 the total staff of the 86 PDAMs in existence was about 14,400. A recent
study of manpower and training needs predicts that by 1990 the total PDAM man-
power must rise to 38,000 (Annex 1, Table A.1.6). The DAB has in progress a
human resources development programme which was started in 1979 with the
Netherlands government and Bank assistance. It has the objective of training
management, administrative and operating personnel for DAB and water
enterprises. PUOD also has recently introduced a one month course for PDAM
-mnagers and a number of foreign-assisted projects have established their own
training courses. As part of a broader effort to strengthen MPW staff training,
CK is attempting to move more of the craining activities to the provinces. For
Repelita IV a 'Manpower Development Program' will be established with training
aimed at six broad groups: government agencies, BPAM/PDAM's consultants and
contractors, suppliers and manufacturers, educational institutions and profes-
sional organizations and non-government organizations.
1.14      Operation and Maintenance.  Water systems, although generally built by
DAB, are operated by the local government either as a unit of its public works
department (Dinas) or as a PDAM. As a Dinas, staff and accounts are not kept
separate from other local government functions and water revenues flow into the
local government's general fund. Each PDAM has a Board of Directors with repre-
sentation from local government, charged with providing a public service through
a financially viable, well managed organization. Newly employed PDAM staff
require extensive training and accounting, management and operational systems
have to be developed. As part of this institution building function, on cen-
trally funded projects DAB sets up PDAM management, operating and accounting
systems and trains staff in their use. The Directorate General of Public
Administration and Regional Autonomy (PUOD) of DDN has the authority to super-
vise and assist the PDAMs. However, for operations and maintenance, (after
project completion), DAB has neither the power nor sufficient staff to continue
this assistance and control, nor does PUOD have the staff or qualifications to
do so. Periodic review of operating results of PDAMs under the Bank financed
projects indicates unsatisfactory performances at many PDAMs. Review of staff-
ing indicates several vacancies at senior levels; high incidence of existing
staff who are not permanent employees of the PDAMs and are frequently withdrawn;



6-
and lack of authoritative direction to support the organizational development of
PDAMs. Following a study of appropriate arrangements for the supervision of
PDAM's operations, DDN, MPW and Governor of East Java have agreed to assign
development function to the Provincial Cipta Karya (PCK) in East Java which
would monitor the performance and provide assistance to all water entities in a
systematic and timely manner (para. 2.12).
1.15      PDAM Organization Structure.  In view of the relatively small size and
weak financial viability of many of the PDAMs, the Bank-finance first East Java
Water Supply Project (Loan 2275-IND) included a study of alternative organiza-
tion structures. The consultants, who recently completed their draft report,
examined several options and are recommending the establishment of an organiza-
tion on a province-wide basis.  Given the PDAM monitoring arrangements, a pro-
vincial PDAM is not essential for East Java. However, in small provinces where
organizational capacity at local level is weaker, the issue would be more
important. GOI is reviewing the merits of the proposed reorganization of water
enterprises and alternative solutions. In the meantime, the proposed project
includes consultancy services for determining suitable organization structure
for the water entities in Irian Jaya, South Sulawesi and North Sulawesi
provinces. The studies are expected to be completed by November 30, 1986.
1.16      Water Resource Management.  The growing scarcity of water supplies for
agricultural, municipal and industrial purposes in Java highlights the need for
increased emphasis on water resource management and appropriate allocation of
supplies. Few economically feasible new sites remain for large storage pur-
poses, irrigation efficiency remains relatively low, dam operating rules are not
always optimized, and consequently, despite increasing use of groundwater,
necessary supplies for the rapidly growing urban areas and industrial centers
are restricted. Surabaya, the largest industrial city in Indonesia, has been
unable for many years to respond to demands for potable water due to raw water
shortages in the Brantas Basin. The shortages arise partly because of incom-
plete inventory of the region's surface and groundwater resources as well as
indequate planning for their exploitation and conservation. Available supplies
are also being steadily degraded through pollution from point sources and
residential areas, and groundwater mining. An urgent need for a concerted water
resource management strategy exists, particularLy in East Java. GOI through its
Directorate General for Water Resources Development of MPW, is reviewing, with
Japanese Government assistance, aspects of this issue in the Brantas Basin but
additional studies are needed.
Bank Role and Rationale for involvement
1.17      The Bank's role and rationale for involvement in this sector in
general and this project in particular are to (a) support low-cost technology
development through refinement of the innovative low-cost mass approach
pioneered by GOI for water supply to semi-rural communities (IKKs); (b) streng-
then the central agencies responsible for sector planning; (c) strengthen
provincial and local government capabilities to plan, implement and subsequently
operate and monitor services so that there can be increasing decentralization of
responsibility; (d) support GOI's programs of physical development; (e) assist
in manpower development; (f) improve resource mobilization through increases in
locally-generated funds and introduction of improved financial planning and



management measures in local government and water enterprises; and (g) help
identify and draw attention to issues requiring resolution e.g. PDAM organiza-
tion structure and water resource management. The Asian Development Bank and
the Australian and Netherlands Governments are equally committed to support of
the sector and there has been good coordination and a useful exchange of
information between these and other external agencies and the Bank.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Background and Objectives
Background
2.01      To date, Bank water supply sector assistance focussed in East Java is
expected to benefit about two million of the Province's 30 million innabi-
tants. Through earlier Bank-supported projects, water works will have been
financed in 14 of the 37 possible Kabupaten and Kotamadya PDAMs. As the next
stage similar BNA and IKK works in 75 towns serving over 800,000 persons have
been proposed for implementation through this project covering 12 further
PDAMs. In addition, a badly needed expansion of production facilities in the
provincial capital, Surabaya, deferred from inclusion in -he Fifth Urban
Development Project (Loan 2408-IND), was further investigated and proposed for
inclusion in the new project. Preparations for both these subprojects were
carried out by consultants funded through Loans 1709-IND and 2275-IND (para.
2.18) and reviewed by several missions during 1984 and 85.
Project Objectives
2.02      In line with the Bank strategy, the objective of the proposed project
is to provide continuing support to GOI's water sector deveLopment and invest-
ment program, specifically: (a) to substantially increase Low-cost water
production and distribution facilities throughout East Java Province in conform-
ity with Repelita IV targets; (b) to provide technical assistance to forthcoming
or recently established water enterprises in East Java for sounder operation and
system expansion through introduction of and training in appropriate management,
accounting, operating and maintenance practices; (c) to improve provincial
government level capability in: (i) planning and implementation of water supply
investment programs; (ii) monitoring and development of PDAM performance;
(iii) provision of technical assistance and training to PDAMs; and (iv) water
pollution control; (d) to impLement improved financing policies; and (e) to help
in preparation ce other water supply projects.
B. Project Description
Summar
2.03      The proposed project would address water supply needs and deficiencies
in a wide range of urban and semi-rural communities throughout East Java
Province, with particular emphasis on low income groups, and would comprise:



8-
Part A: BNA/IKK Towns - provision of new water supplies totalling
0.75 cu m/s to at Least 75 medium-to-small sized towns and development
of 12 water entities in East Java;
Part B: Surabaya - major works including source development, treat-
ment plant and transmission/distribution pipelines for a 1 cu m/s
expansion, as well as rehabilitation of the existing water supply
system; and measures to abate water pollution in the Surabaya river,
and reduce cost of water to low-income groups in the provincial
capital, Surabaya;
Part C: Institutional Development - provision of central and various
provincial training facilities, equipment and tuition; and
strengthening of pollution control mechanisms and establishment of a
PDAM development unit in East Java; and
Part DM/: Other Technical Assistance - provision of (i) advisory
services and staff training in project implementation, management, and
operations for the purposes of Parts A and B of the project; and (ii)
future project preparation studies.
Part A - BNA/IKK Towns
2.04      Part A of the proposed project would provide new water supply systems
for at least 75 medium and small sized towns situated in 11 kabupatens and one
kotamadya in East Java. Twelve of the towns are BNA Category 4 with populations
between 20,000 and just over 100,000 persons, while the remaining towns are
Category 5 (or IKK) with populations between 3,000 and 20,000 persons. The
beneficiary cities and towns were selected by Cipta Karya in consultation with
DDN, the East Java Provincial government and local governments on the basis of
social and economic criteria (see Annex 2). The town locations are shown on Map
19110 and their names in Annex 1, Table 3. Although the numbers and locations
of the BNA and IKK towns have been established, allowance has been made to add
or substitute a limited number at a later stage provided their replacements meet
the selection criteria and funds are sufficient.
2.05      Each town system would comprise an already proven spring or deepwell
source, transmission and distribution pipework, service connections (including
in-house storage in IKK schemes), public standpipes and office and workshop
facilities. 8NA systems also include standby wells, service reservoirs and fire

Part D of the project given here differs from the description contained
in the Loan Agreement by virtue of the explicit inclusion of project
implementation assistance.



protection facilities.21 Details of the respective systems are given in
Annex 2.
2.06      Demand.  The BNA/IKK town subproject would benefit about 800,000
domestic consumers as well as government, commercial and industrial users, many
of whom would have access to piped water for the first time. Only 12 of the
project towns possess existing water supply systems; even those serving a small
percentage of the project area population. Most households currently obtain
their water from dugwells. However, these are difficult to find in the hillier
areas and often contaminated in the lowland areas. Because of the availability
of alternative supplies and the difficulty in providing coverage of sparsely
developed fringe areas, GOI's service level policy provides for the demands of
60% of the 1985 project area population in BNA towns and about 70Z of the 1995
population in IKK towns. It is further assumed that house or yard connections
would serve 50Z of the design population of BNA towns and about 70% of the IKK
towns. The remainder would be served by public standpipes. Average consump-
tions of 120, 60 and 30 l/c/d are assumed at house, yard and standpipe connec-
tions respectively.  Although the GOI's design supplXes are unlikely to meet all
the water supply demands in many of the households,3 in most cases alternative,
traditional sources are available for laundering, gardening and other non-
personal uses. A typical demand analysis is shown in Annex 2.
Part B - Surabaya
2.07      Part B would provide an additional 1 cu m/s of treated water to the
city of Surabaya and assist in the rehabilitation of part of the existing dis-
tribution system. Minor improvements to the Brantas Basin irrigation system
would be funded by the project and are expected to yield about 1.1 cu m/s addi-
tional raw water in the Surabaya River through lining of about 92 km of tertiary
and quarternary irrigation channels and reduction of excessive leakage through
control gates on the river. A site of 9 ha has been acquired by PDAM Surabaya,
sufficient for a plant of 5 cu m/s total capacity at Karangpilang, located on
2/   The chief difference between BNA and IKK systems lies in the physical
design of their source works and distribution systems. Unlike BNA
systems, which follow conventional water supply system design cLiteria in
respect to peak flow and system storage capacity, the IKK systems are
deliberately designed to minimize investment cos.ts by, among other
things, adoption of average flow capacity standards and reliance on new
and traditional facilities for household water storage and liraited public
standpipe storage. This technique is made possible by means of a flow-
limiting device which rations each household to its daily water
allotment. The trickle feed from the flow-limiter is provided constantly
over a full 24 hours and accumulated in a 300 liter capacity tank in the
household or a 3.5 cu m tank at standpipes. The flow can be shut off in
the unusual event of an overflow.
3/   Recorded water use patterns in East Java indicate average household
..onsumption for all purposes to be 88 l/c/d, with an average household
size of 7 in urban areas and 10 in semi-rural areas.

the river about 13 km upstream from its existing 3 cu m/s plant at Ngagel.  A
river intake and first-stage treatment capacity of I cu m/s would be constructed
under the project, comprising conventional sediment removal, clarification and
rapid gravity filtration processes. A pumping station and 7.5 km long, 1,000 -
diameter transmission main would also be constructed, which would connect to new
distribution mains to be provided on the western side of the city. A study
financed under Loan 2275-IND is intended to establish a loss reduction action
program which would attempt to reduce unaccounted for water to about 25Z of
production by 1991 through rehabilitation of existing mains, service connections
and meters. Agreement by PDAM Surabaya to carry out the principle rehabilita-
tion works commencing April 1, 1988 was obtained at negotiations.
2.08      Demand.  Potable water supplies, amounting on average to 174,500 cu
m/d, are sold by the PDAM through an estimated 93,000 connections of which
74,000 are for residential consumers (1983 PDAM data). About 1.1 milLion people
representing approximately 50Z of the Surabaya population, receive water either
directly ox indirectly from the PDAM. The remaining 50% of the population
obtain their water from dug wells, rivers and canals. Existing sources of raw
water supply are polluted, of insufficient capacity to meet present demand and
the distribution network does not extend to all parts of the city, moreover,
unaccounted-for-water losses have increased in recent years to about 37% of
production.  The PDAM is currently implementing a program of reinforcement and
extension of the distribution system, supported in part by the Second Water
Supply Project (Loan 1709-IND).  However, demand is expected still to exceed the
available supply on completion of the proposed project, mainly due to raw water
apply constraints. Development of additionaL raw water sources to provide at
least   further 4 cu m/s is estimated as necessary to meet 1995 require-
ments.& The proposed project is expected to p 2vide similar levels of service
as provided to curreut PDAM Surabaya customers -  and is roughly expected to
serve some &00,000 people through an additional 35,000 residential, standpipe
and industrial connections as well as improve levels of service in areas of the
city with intermittent supplies. Detailed demand estimates are given in
Annex 3.
2.09      Desp.te considerable effort by PDAM Surabaya supported in part by the
Bank, to promcte supply of safe water to the poor, a large percentage of poor
families in Surabaya continue to rely on non-piped water for their drinking and
bathing needs. The major constraints include: (a) the actual price of piped
water; (b) the inadequacy of the distribution networks particularly the small
number or standpipes which results in the emergence of a vendor system which in
41   Surabaya's population is expected to be about 3.4 million in 1995.  GOI
is currently studying possible raw water sources with Japanese Government
and ADB assistance. Pollution controls intended to protect existing
sources would be strengthened under the project (para. 2.13).
5/   PDAM data indicate that average daily demant at residential, commercial
and industrial connections during mid-1983 was 1.16, 1.83 and 6.24 cu m
respectively. The residential consumption is equivalent to about 200
l/c/d.

turn substantially increases the net price of water; and (c) high cost of
acquiring a house connection at about four times the actual cost of
connection. In Surabaya the poor pay in some cases more than ten times the
normal rate to the water vendors, although of course they buy small quantities
at about 20-40 llc/d.
2.10      In view of scarcity of water in the city and the large investment
ahead of the PDAM, it has not been possible to fully implement GOI policy for
low-income group water supply in Surabaya at this time. It is expected that
this problem will be resolved in the long term by introduction of substantial
new water supplies as planned under the proposed future project (para. 2.16) and
by improving the distribution system. Nevertheless the following measures
intended to improve the water supply for the poorest have been agreed, and were
confirmed during negotiations as part of the project:
(a) reducsion in the char e to standpipe, concessionaires from Rp 110-
180/m  to Rp 80-120/m  under the PDAMs new tariff structure;
(b) controll-ng charges levied by the concessionaires to not more than
Rp 300/mr (effective April 1, 1985);
(c) increasing the number of standpipe outlets under the KIP program 6/
which provides about 170 new outlets per year, and 150 standpipes
under PDAM's own distribution program; and
(d) avoiding an increase in the existing level of connection fees for low-
income properties and allowing low income co sumers to pay the
connection fee by six monthly installments.-
Part C - Institutional Development
2.11      Training.  The training component of the proposed project would have
three objectives. First, in continuing to develop the training objectives of
the first project, including the establishment of a permanent, regional training
facility, it would create training self-sufficiency in the East Java water
6/   The Kampung Improvement Program in Surabaya, supported since 1976 through
Loans 1336-IND, 1653-IND and 2408-IND, provides basic infrastructure
improvements in over 2,000 ha of high-density, low income areas and
includes about 1,300 standpipes funded partly by grants from GOI. If the
number of standpipes continue to rise at the present rate, in 1990 some
5,400 outlets would be able to supply about 38Z of the city's population
(at 200 persons per outlet).
7/   Connection fees for Low income properties can be as low as about
Rp 120,000 while the average cost of making a connection, including a 25%
allowance for profit, is about Rp 100,000. Credit terms will be extended
as soon as the water from the proposed project becomes available.

sector. Second, it would develop the capacity of DAB's training facility at
Pejompongan, Jakarta, including its staff capability, to assume fully the role
of the National Training Development Center. Finally, it would assist the
development of additional sector training capacity elsewhere in Indonesia, by
financing the construction of a Provincial Training Unit at Semarang, and the
upgrading of existing training facilities at Medan, Ujung Pandang, and Bandung,
to full provincial level standards. A total of about 900 persons related to the
proposed project would require training during the project duration. About 50
formal and in-service training courses would be provided each year to senior-
and middle-level managers, administrative staff and technical operators of the
project PDAM's, as well as CK, Provincial staff and contractors. Details of
CK's training strategy, project training objectives, and target audiences are
given in Annex 4.
2.12      Monitoring and Development of Water Entities.  GOI has agreed to
assign development function for monitoring and providing assistance to East Java
water entities to East Java PCK whose functions would be to: (i) provide
technical and financial guidance and related implementation support to water
entities; (ii) supervise the operational, financial and management performance
of water entities; and (iii) assist in preparation of investment plans and
tariff adjustments. A building will be provided (at the Wiyung complex)
together with equipment and technical assistance and the government has agreed
to provide adequate staff and operating budget for the unit. Agreement was
reached at negotiations on the staffing and implementation arrangements.
Details of the unit are given in Annex 5.
2.13      Water Pollution Control in East Java.  The GOI has agreed to carry out
measures intended to abate pollution in the Surabaya River (para. 5.11)
including short-term actions to reduce industrial and residential waste dis-
charges and longer-term institutional development of the East Java Governor's
Office in carrying out its water pollution control responsibilities. On the
basis of recommendations made in a study carried out under Loan 2275-IND,
consultants will assist in the design and implementation of organizational
improveents, monitoring and supervisorv systems, and technical advisory
services. Further details of the pollution control action program are given in
Annex 6.
Part D - Other Technical Assistance
2.14      The project would include technical assistance to:  (a) facilitate
implementation; and (b) prepare future water supply projects in East Java and
elsewhere. Details of the required assistance are given in Annex 7 and
summarized below. Terms of reference and short lists for the various assign-
ments, many of which are similar to assignments funded under Loan 2275-IND, were
discussed at negotiations.
2.15      Project implementation assistance for Parts A and B of the Project
totalling 18 and 144 man-months of foreign and local consultants respectively
would incLude:



- 13 -
(a) engineering and management advisory services to the PMUs and PIUs; and
(b)  PDAM institutional development including setting up of management,
accounting and personnel services.
2.16      Preparation of (a) a proposed Third East Java Water Supply project
intended to complete coverage of all remaining communities deficient in water
supply in East Java; (b) a second Surabaya water supply expansion project
intended to increase treatment and distribution facilities from Karangpilang by
2 cu m/s and (c) water supply organization structure recommendations for the
provinces of Irian Jaya, North and South Sulawesi (totalling 165 and 750 man-
months of foreign and local consultants respectively).
Status of Project Preparation
2.17      Feasibility studies, detailed designs and procurement documenp  have
been completed for Parts A, B and C of the project by CK's consultants._
Studies and final designs for a total of 25 BNA subprojects were prepared under
the Second Water Supply Project (Loan 1709-IND). However, prior to the
negotiation of the first East Java Water Supply Project Lcan 2275-IND, it was
decided that 12 of these towns had lesser priority for development and implemen-
tation was held over until the proposed Project. Further preparation to update
cost estimates to current levels and some design revision for these towns was
therefore carried out (under Loan 2275-IND) together with preparation of the
subprojects for the 64 IKK towns.   Land for Part A consists of numerous small
plots which would be acquired during the project, as in the first East Java
project. Land acquisition for Part B has been completed. All proposed source
wells have been drilled, tested and lined.
8/   Consultants for the project are as follows:
Part A - feasibility studies and detailed engineering BNA/IKK towns:
Principal Consultants Sir M. MacDonald and Partners (United Kingdom) in
association with Deserco Development Services (Indonesia) and SGV
Consultants (Philippines) and Local Counterpart Consultants Ciriajasa
Consulting Engineers (Indonesia);
Part B - feasibility study and detailed engineering Karangpilang water
treatment plant: Sir M. MacDonald and Partners and P.T. Encona
(Indonesia);
Part C - institutional development program: W.D. Scott (Australia)
(funded by the Australian Development Assistance Bureau) in association
with Deserco, PT Relevant Development and Unisystems (Indonesia); and
DHV/IWACO (Netherlands) in association with Deserco.

C. Project Costs
2.18      The total project cost is estimated to be 88.5 billion Rupiah
(US$80.4 million equivalent) of which the foreign exchange element (both direct
and indirect) is estimated at 52% or about 46 billion Rupiah. Taxes and duties
are estimated at about 7.3 billion Rupiah. Suimmary cost estimates are given in
Table 2.1 below and detailed cost estimates are given in Annex 8.
2.19      Project costs were estimated by CK and their consultants and Bank
staff on the basis of detailed engineering designs or, in the case of Part B,
advanced preliminary engineering, and include land acquisition, construction,
materials, equipment, vehicles, and physical and price contingencies. All base
cost estimates are expressed in June 1985 prices. Physical contingencies of 10Z
of base costs have been allowed in all cases except Part D Technical Assistance,
where an allowance of 5Z has been made. Price coutingencies for local currency
costs are based on expected increases in construction costs of 8.0% in 1985 to
1990 and 5Z per annum thereafter. The corresponding rates for foreign costs are
5% in 1985, 7.5% in 1986, 8% in 1987-90 and 5X per annum thereafter. The
overall price contingency amounts to about 20% of base costs. Technical
assistance costs included in Parts C and D total US$11.9 million equivalent.
D. Project Financing Arrangements
2.20      The proposed Bank loan would finance about 60% of total project cost
net of taxes, duties and reserve procurement. The loan would be made to the
Goverrment of Indonesia for a period of 20 years incLuding five years of grace
at the standard variable interest rate. The loan would be passed to the
beneficiary PDAM's as a grant, excepting Surabaya PDAM in which case the loan
proceeds would be onlent at 12% interest for a period of 20 years including
5 years' grace.

2.21     GOI would be responsible for about 40% of the project costs and PDAM
Surabaya for about 6%, the latter being provided from internal cash genera-
tion. The sources of project finance are summarized in Table 2.2 above. GOI
expects to obtain bilateral aid or cofinancing sources for services valued at
about US$2.5 million in total, required under Parts C and D of the project.
Confirmation of the amounts and sources was provided at negotiations.
2.22      The project financing plan has been developed in accordance with GOI
policy for financing of water supply system investments (para. 1.08).
III. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
A. Executing Agencies
The Borrower
3.01     The Government of Indonesia would be the borrower and would pass the
proceeds, together with the local currency requirements, to the executing
agency, CK, which, in cooperation with the East Java Provincial Government, two
kotamadyas (including Surabaya) and eleven kabupatens, would implement the
project. On completion of the project the assets would be transferred to the
PDAMs and management and operations would be entrusted to them.
Cipta Karya and Directorate of Water Supply
3.02      Cipta Karya with a staff of about 5,000, is composed of six Directc-
rates with responsibility for programming, public housing, urban and regional
planning, sanitation and water supply and building research. The water supply
directorate, DAB, is itself composed of five sub-directorates. These are the
Sub-directorates of Planning, Implementation West, Implementation East, Stores
and Equipment, and Organizational Development. DAB employs about 1,600 staff.
About 500 of DA3 _ staff are employed at the headquarters in Jakarta.  Of these
about 300 are directly engaged on central planning, development and construction
activities. About 30% of the staff at the headquarters hold engineering or
technical degrees and another 25% are educated in finance or administration.
DAB is making increasing use of its province based offices, and cooperates with
provincial, kotamadya and kabupaten governments in the impLementation of
projects.
3.03      DAB's Planning Sub Directorate is currently the focal point for the
planning of BNA and IKK projects. Its 150 engineers and technicians, with the
assistance of consultants, prepare projects, train regional staff in project
design, review designs, and monitor projects and programs. Some of DAB's plann-
ing functions will be transferred shortly to the Directorate of Programming.
DAB also has regional project offices in all the 27 provinces; these offices
normally execute projects outside Jakarta. For large projects and those which
receive foreign assistance DAB appoints specific project managers who work under
the general supervision of the Director of DAB. The organizations of Cipta
Karya and DAB are shown in Figures B and C.



- 17 -
3.04      Cipta Karya and DAB receive considerable technical assistance:  in
addition advisors provided under on-going Bank-funded projects, the Australian
Government has provided six engineering advisors and co-financing arrangements
between the Bank and the Australian Government have been drawn up to cover
institutional and other studies. The sector is also supported by funds and
specialist inputs provided by, amongst others, ADB, WHO, UNDP, and several
bilateral funding agencies.
The Provincial and Kabupaten Covernments
3.05      East Java province is managed by the Governor who, while reporting to
the Ministry of Home Affairs, is also the representative of all central
ministries active in the Province. In 1982 it was decided that the Provincial
Public Works Department of East Java would be split into three departments,
Cipta Karya (for urban development), Bina Marga (roads) and Pengairan (irriga-
tion), each reporting to the Governor. The new Provincial Cipta Karya (PCK),91
which will take over the urban development staff of the former Provincial Public
Works Department, would share responsibility for project implementation with
Central Cipta Karya. To this end, in addition to its own staff, it would also
use qualified persons from the public works departments of the second level
governments.
Water Entities
3.06      Project facilities would eventually be owned and operated by PDAMs
under the direction and ownership of the kabupaten or kotamadya governments in
which they are located. Law No. 5 o' 1962, Law No. 5 of 1974, the Ministry of
Home Affairs Decree 26 of 1975 and the joint Ministry of Home Affairs and
Ministry of Public Works Decrees 3, 4 and 5 of 23rd January 1984 provide the
legal framework for PDAMs. The regulation of each PDAM is approved by the
respective People's Council of the kotamadya or kabupaten and it is ratified by
the Governor. Whereas typically PDAMs were organized to serve a single urban
area, in order to effectively and efficiently use management systems and
manpower, PDAMs have been organized during last few years to operate all water
systems within a kabupaten or a kotamadya. PDAMs in Part A (BNA/IKK Towns) of
the proposed project will be structured in this way.
3.07      Five PDAMs covered by the project are already formed (Kotamadyas
Surabaya and Pasuruan and Kabupatens Pasuruan, Ngawi and Probolinggo) and
operate existing water supply systems. Four of the eight other kabupatens
containing project towns also have towns with existing water enterprises
(Pacitan, Ponorogo, Nganjuk and Bondowoso) but PDAMs have not yet been estab-
lished. In Kabupatens Pacitan, Ponorogo, and Nganjuk the existing systems are
BPAM (para. 1.06). The existing system in Bondowoso is operated by the
9/   Although PCK shares the same name as CK they are in fact unrelated
organizations; the former being responsible ultimately to DDN. However,
central CK staff are often seconded to or work closely with PCK, and in
East Java the head of MPW KANWIL and of Provincial Public Works is the
same person.

kabupaten Public Works Department. Agreement has already been reached between
CK and the respective heads of the Level II local governments concerned and was
confirmed at negotiations that: (a) PDAMs in all remaining eight kabupatens
will be formed as the project systems come into operation and the water entities
become financially viable, in any case not later than December 31, 1992;
(b) each PDAM will incorporate both new and existing water supply systems. All
water entities will be organized or reorganized to operate the proposed water
supply systems. The structure of PDAM Surabaya is shown in Figure D. The
typical structure of existinglad proposed kabupaten PDAMs included in the
project is shown in Figure E.
3.08      PDAM management reports to a board of directors.  The board chairman
is typically the head (Walikota or Bupati) of the kotamadya or kabupaten. The
members of the Board of Directors are appointed by the Walikota or Bupati for a
four year term. There are generally four to five members and they usually
include the heads of the Health Services Section, Public Works Section, and
Finance Section, of the local government and a branch of any government bank.
The board appoints the Managing Director who, with the assistance of three
deputy managers (Finance, Technical and Operations), is responsible for imple-
menting policy an' conducting day to day business. Kabupaten PDAMs have a head
office usually in the principal city and local operating units in the other
cities and towns of the kabupatens. Tariff adjustments are approved by each
PDAM board and ratified by the Walikota and Bupati and Governor. There are
national guidelines for the tariff structure which are generally followed by
PDAMs (para. 4.05).
B. Project Organization and Management
3.09      Responsibility for the management and supervision of construction of
water supply projects in East Java rests with CK, which intends to use similar
implementation arrangements as in use successfully in the first East Java Water
Supply Project. PUOD would assist on policy matters and in dealings with local
governments. Figure F shows the organization structure for implementation of
the project.
3.10      The present Project Management Unit (PMU East Java) for the first East
Java project would continue in its present role and would be responsible for
Parts A and B of the project, as well as coordinate reporting by the several
proposed Project Implementation Units (PIUs) including those to be set up for
the components to be implemented outside East Java. The present PIU for the
first East Java project would also continue its role as well as take respons-
ibility for Part A of the proposed project. Since their establishment for the
first project, the two units have gained a great amount of experience in the
management, coordination and supervision of a diverse, major project which is
10/ Detailed descriptions of the enterprises included in the project are
given in the feasibility studies and socio-economic, institutional and
financial reports in the Project File (Annex 17).



- 19 -
proceeding quite satisfactorily to date. Both units would be strengthened to
cope with the net additionaL workload caused by the proposed project through
transfers of CK and PCK staff, as well as consultant advisers. New PIUs would
be formed for the purposes of Part B and the training component of Part C of the
project. Another Project Management Unit (PMU Jakarta) would be established and
would be responsible for Parts C and D of the project. The project organization
arrangements are illustrated in Figure E. The project implementation
arrangements, staffing and responsibilities of the various units are shown in
Annex 10 and were confirmed at negotiations.
3.11      The PMUs would manage and coordinate all subproject planning and
implementation activities under the general supervision of CK. In addition, the
PMUs would be responsible for liaison with CK, PCK, local governments and PDAMs
and the Bank, project progress reporting and monitoring, and consumer educa-
tion. The PIUs would be responsible for procuring goods and civil works by
LCB. CK would be responsible for recruitment of consultants and ICB procure-
ment, excepting in the case of Part B which would be handled by the PIU.
Construction supervision progress certification and disbursement application
would be the responsibility of the respective PIUs, which would also maintain
the necessary documentation in support of SOE applications (para. 3.18).
3.12      PDAM Surabaya would be delegated to be the PIU for Part B under the
overall supervision of CK under similar arrangements as for Loan 1709-IND. The
Managing Director of PDAM Surabaya will be the subproject director, responsible
for implementing all aspects of the subproject. A new project office would be
established within PDAM with a suitably qualified engineer as Project Supervisor
supported by other technical staff. The Project Supervisor will be supported by
qualified and experienced engineering staff including a Deputy to be seconded
from CK, to enable him to evaluate and approve engineering designs and procure-
ment documents, to supervise construction and to coordinate other principal
activities associated with implementation of the project. Consultants appointed
for preparation of final designs and contract documents are expected to complete
their assignment about mid-1985, and a further consultancy assignment is
provided for during the construction phase, for technical evaluations.
construction supervision and management assistance. Agreement was reached at
negotiations that all required consultants and key staff would be appointed in
accordance with the Implementation Schedule agreed with the Bank.
3.13      In line with GOI policy, locally procured works will be carried out by
'economically-weak' contractors, i.e., those rated as Class C contractors in the
Province's annually-updated prequalified contractors list. In view of the
relative inexperience of such contractors, the PIUs will be provided with
experienced full-time supervisory staff and transport facilities to ensure an
acceptable standard of construction.
Implementa 'on Schedule
3.14      The project would be implemented over a six-year period, October 1985
to December 1991, as illustrated in Figure C.

C. Procurement
3.15      Procurement for the proposed project will follow closely the proce-
dures established for the first East Java project (Loan 2275-IND). Civil works
contracts costing about US$6.6 million and sixteen equipment and materials
contracts totalling about US$18 million, together representing 44Z of the
proposed construction costs, would be procured on the basis of ICB in accordance
with Bank Guidelines. The balance of the civil works and equipment supply,
totalling about US$36.5 million, comprising about 180 contracts of estimated
size ranging from US$80,000 to US$1.8 million equivalent, that are unlikely to
be of interest to foreign bidders, would be procured following local competitive
bidding procedures (LCB) which were reviewed by the mission and found satis-
factory to the Bank. Vehicles, including motorcycles, valued at about
US$1.1 million equivalent would be subject to reserve procurement because GOI
restricts their importation. Equipment, materials and minor works (particularly
for rehabilitation of existing water supply systems) required in small lots or
on an urgent need, valued individually at less than US$300,000 equivalent and
totalling less than US$4 million equivalent would be procured through prudent
shopping procedures. Local manufacturers would be granted a preference of 15Z
of the CIF price of imported goods or the prevailing customs duty, whichever is
the lower in the evaluation of bids. Bidding documents for equipment and civil
works contracts exceeding US$500,000 and US$1 million respectively totalling
about US$42 million would be subject to review by the Bank prior to bids being
sought.
3.16      In order to meet the proposed construction timetable, advanced
contracting has been initiated by CK for: (a) goods and materials for Part A of
the project valued at about US$16 million; and (b) civil works for the primary
and main process plants for Part B, valued at about US$19 million. Experience
in other projects in Indonesia shows such procurement typically takes 12-18
months from advertising to award of contract. Procurement in these cases is
.ollowing Bank guidelines and the appropriate reviews by Bank staff are being
carried out. Awards of the contracts concerned are not expected until following
loan effectiveness and will be reviewed by Bank staff in due course. Agreement
was reached at negotiations that (a) procurement of the vehicles required for
the project and subject to reserve procurement would be carried out and com-
pleted under a schedule agreed with the Bank and completed by December 31, 1989
and (b) remaining land acquisition will be completed six months before start of
construction for respective component in accordance with the Implementation
Schedule agreed with the Bank.
3.17      Details of the proposed ICB and LCB contracts and procurement review
arrangements are contained in Annex 9. A summary of the procurement arrange-
ments for the project are summarized in the following Table 3.1.
D. Disbursement
3.18      The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed against:  (a) 45% of net
expenditures for civil works for Parts A and C of the project; and 65% for Part
B of the project; (b) 1OOZ of the foreign 'CIF) cost of directly imported
equipment; 95% of ex-factory costs if locally manufactured equipment; and 65Z
for other locally procured equipment; and (c) 100% of expenditures for technical
assistance not financed from other sources. All disbursements would be made
following standard Bank documentation requirements, excepting minor procurement
under all categories valued at less than US$100,000 equivalent per contract for
which Statements of Experditure (SOE) procedures would be used.

agreed at negotiations: (a) to delegate payment authority for expenditures from
the pre-financing funds to the PMU (East Java); and (b) not to apply to the Bank
for disbursements less than $100,000 in aggregate at any one time.
3.20      The estimated disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 9 along with the
country profile. It is expected that loan disbursements will be completed by
March 31, 1992, about six months after completion of civil works. The disburse-
ment period of nearly seven years is slightly less than the current country
performance of within eight years, due to the good disbursements performance to
date in the similar Loan 2275-IND], the proposed use during implementation of
experienced staff from that project (para. 3.10) and the advanced state of
project preparations and procurement (paras 2.18 and 3.16). Disbursement
progress would be monitored by the PMU for all subprojects.

E. Accounts and Audits
3.21      Project accounts will be maintained by each PMU and PIU starting with
accounts for COI's fiscal year ending March 31, 1986. These accounts will be
audited by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank and the audit state-
ments made available to the Bank within seven months of the close of each fiscal
year. Accrual accounting systems are to be in place for each of the water
entities with the assistance of the proposed consultants, well before the time
the project facilities come into operation. After the accounting systems are in
place, these would be audited annually starting with accounts for the year
ending December 31, 1990, by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank and
audit reports made available to the provincial monitoring unit in PCK who would
send a summary including the actions taken to carry out any recommendations by
the auditors, to the Bank not later than August 31 each year. For PDAM
Surabaya, satisfactory audit arrangements are already in place and would be
continued (para. 4.17). COI has indicated that PDAM Surabaya audit reports
would also be provided to PCK for follow up.
F. Operations and Maintenance
3.22      Operation and administration of the 75 BNA/IKK water supply sub-
projects would eventually come under the control of 12 separate PDAM organiza-
tions. Eleven of these will be kabupaten-wide PDAMs which would incorporate the
BHA and IKK project towns, as well as other towns with existing water supply
systems (within each kabupaten). The twelfth PDAM would operate the Kotamadya
Pasuruan water supply system. Water for each BNA and IKK system will be
chlorinated but other treatment is unlikely to be necessary because all water
sources confirmed to date meet the WHO Drinking Water Standards. PLN mains
power supplies would be utilized for all the BNA towns and for all IKK towns
where mains power is available. On-site generators would be utilized where
mains power is not available. In all cases a standby generator would be
provided for IKR towns. Generators and pumps would be maintained through
service contracts with respective suppliers.
3.23      New offices and a central workshop for each PDAM would also be
provided during the project. The Head Office and Workshop would be fully
equipped to operate the water supply systems it controls and would hold spare
equipment in store. Training of PDAM operators would be provided both by the
PIU and its consultants on specific aspects of the new systems, and by means of
general training courses to be provided under Part C of the project.
3.24      A responsibility of the P1MU would be to assist PDAM Surabaya to engage
sufficient staff and to provide the necessary training to enable them to take
over operation of the treatment works at the end of the recommended transition
period following commissioning. It is expected that a proportion of the staff
engaged by the PDAM project office for day-to-day supervision of construction
would be retained to form the nucleus of the operating group for the new treat-
ment works under the PDAM Director of Production. These arrangements are
satisfactory.

C. Monitoring and Evaluation
3.25      Monitoring the progress of the project toward its physical, financial
and institution-building objectives would be through reports prepared by the PMU
(East Java) for project management purposes. The reports will include relevant
data on progress in the format agreed during negotiations. Performance
indicators (Annex 14) would serve as a basis for evaluating progress toward the
project objectives and will be reported by CK routinely to the Bank. Technical
assistance would be provided to assist the PMU (East Java) and the beneficiary
water entities to establish the project monitoring system effectively. Upon
completion of the project, CK would prepare a completion report within six
months of the closing date of the loan.
IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. BNAIIKK TOWS
Past Finances
4.01      Since existing PDAMs and BPAMs to be covered under the project are in
an early stage of formation, available financial information is limited and is
not fully reliable. Audited financial statements are only available for PDAM
Ngawi (as of March 1981 and 1982), BPAM Nganjuk (first Balance Sheet March
1981), and BPAM Tretes, now a unit of PDAM Kabupaten Pasuruan (as of March ;981
and 1982). In most other existing PDAMs/BPAMs, however, the first Income and
Cash Flow Statements are under preparation. The available information is
summarized in Table 4.1.
4.02      All the enterprises except Kotamadya Pasuruan, Kabupaten Ponorogo and
Tretes (a unit of PDAM kabupaten Pasuruan) incurred losses in 1983 even before
depreciation (ranging from Rp 0.5 million at Pacitan to Rp 13.5 million at
Nganjuk). After deducting depreciation on historic costs, all water enterprises
except PDAM Kotamadya Pasuruan incurred losses. The losses are attributable to
low tariff rates, few service connections and the absence of commercial and
industrial customers capable of paying higher tariffs. The advantage of a
higher number of connections and the presence of industrial and commercial
consumers is exemplified by the better financial performance of Kotamadya
Pasuruan which has the highest number of connections (2,880) of the 8 existing
water enterprises and a significant number of commercial and industrial
connections which use onLy about 14% of the water sold but contribute about 39%
to the revenues.

4.03      Whilst past results are of interest, they have little bearing on the
overall financial projections because the future systems will be either
totally new or will be much greater in size Cabout two to 15 times greater in
terms of service connections) than the present systems. However, the follow-
ing characteristics are shared by most of the existing enterprises:
(a) accounting is on a modified accrual basis. While revenues are
recognized at the time of sales and the majority of expenses are
recognized at the time they are incurred, depreciation expenses are
not always computed or recorded in the books;
(b) the records of fixed assets are very limited. This is particularly
the case for PDAMslBPAMs where the first Balance Sheets are not yet
established by the Auditors;
(c) billing and collection systems need strengthening. Customers settle
their bills at the office of the PDAM/BPAM. Little effort is put
into following up unpaid bills;
(d) operations are subsidized by government in all the enterprises
except kotamadya Pasuruan and Ponorogo where some cash surpluses are
produced;
(e)  labour productivity is very low, up to 39 employees serve 1,000
connections;
(f) house connection charges are high and payment terms stringent.
Connection charges range from Rp 65,000 to over Rp 100,000.
Installments when allowed, are only for 6 months; and



- 25 -
(g)  although average 5ariffs are low in absolute terms (Rp 80, i.e.,
US$0.07, per cu m ) they are not cheap considering the low level of
service provided. Service is not continuous and is only available
to a small segment of the population (between 1.3% in Bondowoso and
16Z in Egawi).
4.04      Technical assistance over a 3 year period will be provided to each
of the water entities under the proposed project to establish PDAMs, develop
or improve their organizational capabilities and strengthaen their financial
performance (para. 2.15). The proposed monitoring arrangement by PCK is
expected to help in improving the situation (para. 2.12 and Annex 5).
Tariff Structure
4.05      The existing water enterprises are currently using several different
tariff structures although all set their minimum tariff at Rp 50 per cubic
meter. However, the enterprises are planning to revise their structures in
the next tariff increases so that they are substantially in line with the
National Water Rate Structure (NWRS) (promulgated by the joint decree of the
Minister of Home Affairs and the Minister of Public Works on 23rd January
1984) which is acceptable to the Bank. The NWRS is presented in Table 4.2.
This tariff structure was adopted in the setting of the recommended tariffs
for each of the 12 PDAMs. The base factor "A" refers to the selling price of
water per cubic meter for residential consumers using 0-10 mi3month. For
residential IKK a tariff factor l.OA was used at all levels of consumption.
Tariff level is set by each water entity based on financiaL needs.
Tariff Levels, Affordability and Willingness to Pay
4.06      According to GOI policy, basic needs systems (defined as those which
provide up to 60 l/c/d on average) would be financed by central government
grants. Accordingly the proposed BNA and IRK schemes will be financed by cen-
tral government grants. Furthermore, water tariffs should be set at levels
sufficient to cover operations and maintenance costs (OEM) and depreciation
while maintaining affordability i.e. water charges to be less than 4% of
monthly income.  Once the PDAMs are fully operational with their full number
of connections this will ensure that each PDAM is financially viable and that
the depreciation allowance will generate cash for working capital or minor
expansions.
4.07      The consultants have updated socio-economic surveys to ascertain the
current levels and distribution of household incomes in the project towns and
the amount consumers might be prepared to pay for water. Using these data,
and the projected O&M costs and depreciation for each PDAH, tariff affordabil-
ity was assessed. The tariff calculation indicates that 10 out of the 12
PDAMs are likely to be able to set a tariff to cover full O&M and depreciation
expenses at an expenditure of up to 4Z of household income.
4.08      The affordability analysis indicates that the required water charge
for the PDAM Hadium and Pacitan rises significantly over the affordability
target and the computed monthly water charge is considerably higher than the
amount householders would be prepared to pay. In these cases it was therefore



- 26 -
unrealistic to maintain the full tariff and the effect of utiLizing a tariff
to cover O&M costs plus a part of depreciation was investigated. This
analysis showed that Madiun and Pacitan will be able to cover OWM plus 45Z and
90Z depreciation respectively.

4.09      The connection charges (in December 1984 prices) will be
(a) Residential, Government, Social - ap 50,000 in BRA and Rp 15,000 in IKK
towns (tp 21,000 with storage tank); (b) Commercial, industrial - Rp 75,000.
The charges will be collected in equal monthly installments over five year
periods without interest.  Impact of the charges on affordability analysis is
minimal.
Financial Projections and Results
4.10      Existing waterworks systems in the project area are included in the
financial projections in line with the concept of a kabupaten-wide water
enterprise. The adopted tariff rates used in the projections are shown in
Table 4.3. The present tariff rates in existing water enterprises, which are
lower than those recommended, are expected to be gradually adjusted to avoid a
budden increase of tariff at the start of the consolidated operations; pro-
cedures for tariff increases are outlined in Project Files (Annex 15). Pro-
jected financial statements for each PDAM consisting of Income Statement,
Sources and Application of Funds, Balance Sheet, Financing Plan, and
Monitoring Indicators relate to entities many of which are yet to be formed
and are based on (a) limited actual data reviewed in paras. 4.01 through 4.03;
(b) socio-econooic data collected during project preparation; and (c)
estimates of capital costs, revenues and operating expenses for the next
several years. The detailed projections for each PDAM are available in
Project Files. Projections for a typical PDAM are shown in Annex 11. The

results are broadly indicative but should be viewed with caution particularly
in relation to revenues derived from semi-rural IKRCs. Assumptions used in the
financial projections are presented in Annex 12.

4.11      The highlights of the assumptions used and the main results of the
financial projections are presented below.
(a)  the total project cost will be funded by Bank loan and by GOI coun-
terpart funds. The assets will be given as a grant to the PDAMs,
thus the financial projections have been prepared without provision
for debt service;
(b) presently, volume of water sold is zero in case of four enter-
prises. In case of others, the increase is minimum of 40% in case
of Pasuran Kotamedya to 26 fold increase in case of B ndowaso. For
the 12 PDAMs, the volume increases from 4.8 million m in 1985 to
20.4 m3 or by more than four times;
(c)  the 1991 average tariff which is a function of costs and         3
affordability in each PDAM varies in 1985 prices from Rp 123/m  in
Kediri to Rp 189 in Probalinggo. The proposed tariffs are
reasonable and acceptable to GOI;
(d) five of the eight enterprises which are now operating, do not cover
any depreciation. Only Parsuruan Kotamadya covers full deprecia-
tion. By 1991, ten are expected to cover 100% and the remaining two
90% and 45%;



- 28 -
(e) five of the eight operating enterprises presently do not cover their
cash operating and maintenance expenses either. The ratio of their
expenses to revenue varies from 112Z to 334%. By 1991, the ratio is
expected to improve to about 70% for all twelve; and
(f) operating deficits are expected to be incurred until completion of
the project construction in 1991. The total deficit over the six
years is Rp 1,333 million for all 12 entities i.e., average of
Rp 1.54 milLion ($1,403 per entity per month). This level of
operating subsidies is in line with the government policy to assist
newly created water enterprises for a period of between 3 to 5
years. Cash shortfalls of the water entities are subsidized by the
local government concerned, whereas central government subsidizes
BPAMs through Cipta Karya. Assurances were obtained during negotia-
tion that required operating subsidy will be made available to the
water entities.
4.12      The key indicators of financial performance of each of the project
PDAM are summarized in Table 4.4.
Revenue Covenant
4.13      Present service in the water systems under operation is limited to a
few thousand persons, with water rationed most of the day. The existing water
entities are financially weak and their staff are inefficient and untrained.
Given the time required to bring about institutional improvement and training,
and the relative large size of new works compared to existing facilities,
normi.1 financial covenants would not be meaningful before the new works enter
into operation. Furthermore, keeping the affordability analysis in view,
assurances were obtained during negotiation that (a) tariff structure will be
set for each water entity along the lines of the National Water Rate
Structure; (b) tariffs will be adjusted every year with objective of reaching
a level in 1991 (on completion of the project) which will allow each water
entity to cover at least operations, maintenance and depreciation on revalued
fixed assets; (c) in the case of water entities in Madiun and Paci..an which
.-re presently expected to cover operations and maintenance expenses, but only
a part of the depreciation expenses, the affordability analysis will be
updated by GOI by December 31, 1990, in order to determine maximum portion of
depreciation on revalued assets which can be recovered. Methodology to be
used for this analysis is set out in Project Files. Since the water entities
have no previous debt service, and the Government and the Bank are financing
100% of the capital expenditure which is transferred as equity to the
entities, this would ensure that with the exception of Madiun and Pacitan,
each water entity is financially viable from cashflow perspective, with the
depreciation allowance generating cash for working capital or minor expan-
sions. The average and minimum tariffs required to comply with the revenue
covenant are shown in Table 4.3. The minimum tariff (in 1985 prices) required
in 1991 to meet this requirement would mean an increase from about Rp 50/mi  to
Rp 116 (US$0.11) which implies a gradual increase in real terms spread over
the next six years. The proposed tariffs would be comparable to those
prevailing elsewhere in Indonesia at this time and are considered reasonable
by GOI. Assurances were also obtained during negotiations that (a) the

depreciation allowance will be used exclusively for improvements or expansions
of the water systems, working capital or to amortize future debt if any; and
(b) in accordance with its current practice, GOI will make satisfactory
arrangements to provide funds for working capital and system expansion needs
of the financially weak water entities.
B. SURABAYA
Existing Enterprise
4.14      Prior to 1978, the water supply cperation for Surabaya was handled
directly by the city government of Surabaya. In 1978, the PDAM Surabaya was
established to manage the waterworks operations. Since then, the PDAM has
operated as a semi-autonomous enterprise within the framework of the City
Government. All waterworks assets previously owned by the Government have
been transferred to che PDAM.
4.15      In 1981, under the Second Water Supply Project (Loan 1709-IND), the
PDAM engaged consultants for management and financial advisory assistance,
covering a broad range of activities including (a) organizing and
restructuring the water enterprise; (b) management, financial and operation
policies; (c) review and development of operational manual; and (d) accounting
system.  As a result of the above assignment, the PDAM has implemented
recommended financiaL procedures to enhance internal control, efficiency, and
the gathering of information.
4.16      A review of the generaL accounting system shows that it is commer-
cially oriented and uses the double entrv and accrual method of bookkeeping.
Important information particularly water production, water consumptifn by
customer category, billings, and collections is available. Financial state-
ments, which include income statement, balance sheet and funds flow statement,
are prepared regularly and the format of the financial reports follows the
standard forms recoumended by GOI. Management reports are likewise regularly
prepared. These include reports on personnel, inventories, billings and
collections.
4.17      Audit of the PDAM is done annually by government auditors and is
completed within six months following the end of the fiscal year. Audit
reports are comprehensive and are reviewed by the PDAM Board of Directors and
management and key recommendations are implemented. This arrangement would be
continued.
Past Finances
4.18      The PDA! Surabaya, has consistently shown profits from its opera-
tions. Likewise, enough cash was accumulated in the past through its depre-
ciation account for the PDAM to finance the third water treatment plant at
Ngagel which was completed in 1982. It is also involved in the financing of
the ongoing distribution project which is being assisted by the IBRD; this
project has suffered some delay, however, the problem has been resolved.

4.19      The highlights of the financial performance of the PDAM for the last
four years (1981 to 1984) are shown in Table 4.5.

Tariffs
4.20      PDAM Surabaya tariffs have been adjusted periodically.  The latest
increase of about 80% which became effective on April 1, 1985, incorporates
six major categories of consumer and 12 sub-categories. The new structure,
which follows the pattern set by the National Water Rate Structure, is presen-
ted in Project Files. It provides for cross-subsidy between the various sub-
categories, with residential consumers being the main beneficiaries. The
lowest charge rate for a Class B Resid ntial consumer (i.e. the lower of the
two residential categories) is Rp 80/m>
Affordability
4.21      The affordability analysis of the new tariff indicates that about
60% of all Surabaya households could afford to pay the water charges for a
domestic connection within 4% of their budget. A similar calculation for
supplies through concessionaires and vendors showed that about 99% of the
population could aff 3rd the service, at the agreed final selling price to the
consumer of Rp 300/mr.

Financing Plan
4.22      As indicated in para. 2.20, the total cost of the Part B would be
funded from the following sources: (a) approximately 55% of the capital cost
(which equals 60% if tax is excluded) from the proposed loan from the Bank;
(b) approximately 252 of the capital cost from a loan from GOI; and
(c) approximately 20% of capital cost from PDAM's internally generated
funds. The proposed loan to the GOI would be at standard conditions. GOI
would then lend 80% of the total project cost to PDAM at a fixed interest rate
of between 11% and 12% p.a. for a period of 25 years including a five year
grace period. A moratorium on interest payments during construction period
has been agreed in order to improve PDAM's short-term cash position. Signing
of a subsidiary loan agreement between GOI and PDAM Surabaya would be a
condition of disbursement for Part B of the Project.
Profit Sharing
4.23      PDAM Surabaya is required to distribute 55% of its net income after
tax to the Kotamadya and the remaining 45Z to various other funds (such as
staff bonus, charities, general reserves, and pension fund). These provisions
are made within the general guidelines of the Ministry of Home Affairs and the
regulations of the Kotamadya Council. However, the Ministry of Home Affairs
has recently issued further guideline to provincial Governors suggesting that
PDAMs should not be required to make any further contributions to their
Kotamadyas and that the PDAMs should be allowed to use their revenues exclu-
sively for water supply related expenses and investments. Local government of
Surabaya has not accepted the guideline fully even though during 1984, it
accepted a contribution of 32% instead of the 55%.  Others also accepted lower
payments. In view of the budgetary needs of the city and other recipients it
has been agreed that these contributions would be limited in future to the
1984 figure (with minor adjustments) plus an increase of 52 each year. Based
on present projections, this would result in gradually lowering the payments
to Kotamadya and others to about 12% and 6Z respectively by 1991. These
arrangements were agreed by GOI during appraisal. Letters frorn the Mayor of
Surabaya and Managing Director of the PDAM confirming the agreed limitiations
on payments to the city and others respectiveLy were received prior to the
loan negotiations.
Financial Projections
4.24      The financial projections for the PDAM are given in A-Iex 11 and the
accompanying detailed assumptions are presented in Annex 12. The projections
consist of Income Statement, Source and Application of Funds, Balance Sheet,
Financing Plan and Monitoring Indicators. Highlights of the assumptions used
in the financial projections are as follows:
(a)  in order to provide increased supplies of water to meet existing and
future demand, it is assumed that Surabaya will continue its program
of expanding the capacity of source and distribution works. The
assumed development programs and dates when water becomes available
are (i) Karangpilang Treatment Works Stage I (Project being proposed
for Bank financing) in 1989; vii) Karangpilang Treatment Works Stage



- 34 -
II in 1992 (2 m3/s); and (iii) rehabilitation and expansion of
distribution mains. The implementation is not expected to be a
major burden on management because the construction is managed by
PMU and PTU which is separate from t-he PDAM with the exception of
secondment of some staff from the PDAM to PIU; and
(b)  sources of funds for Karangpilang Stage II and the major distribu-
tion extensions are assumed to be: 60X of cost (net of taxes) to be
financed by external loans; 201 from GOI loan and the remaining 20%
to be obtained from internally generated funds.
4.25      The results of the analysis show that Surabaya is expected to
continue operating at a profit, throughout the projection period (1985-94).

Based on detailed assumptions outlined in Annex 12 which are reasonable, the
financial position of the PDAM is expected to be satisfactory throughout the
projection period.
Revenue Covenant
4.26      Under the Second Water Supply Project (Loan 1709-IND), GOI is
requirad to take all steps needed, including increases in PDAM's water rates
and charges to provide water revenues at least sufficient to cover its
operating expenses (including depreciation on revalued assets), incerest and
debt amortization in excess cf depreciation. However, as mentioned above,
la-.e cities like Surabaya providing more than 60 l/cId are expected by GOI to
finance part of their investment program from internal cash generation.
Accordingly, it is more appropriate to have a cash generation covenant in case
of Surabaya.  Assurances were obtained during negotiations that GOI would take
all measures (including adjustment of tariffs) as required to produce funds
from the PDAM's internal cash generation equivalent to not less than 30% of



- 35 -
the annual average of the PDAM's capital expenditure incurred or expected to
be incurred, during three years (past, current and next) period. This implies
maintaining of the average tariffs at present level in real terms. As shown
in financial projections in para. 4.25 above, the PDAM is expected to be abLe
to comply with the proposed covenant. The balance of funding required to
implement the investment program would be obtained through loans from the
cental government in accordance with GOI water sector financing policy (para.
1.08).
C. Other Financial Covenants for all PDAMs
4.27      The other financial covenants for Part A (UNARIKM) as weLl as Part B
(Surabaya) water entities include the requirements for the insurance of the
goods to be financed from the proceeds of the Bank loan, and to cover other
risks of the entities consistent with appropriate practice; a limitation on
incurrence of long-term debts without the consent of the Bank unless debt
service is covered at least 1.5 times; and the periodic monitoring of the
entities for financial performance and project financing agreement compliance.
V.  ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Justification
5.01      The population density of Java is higher, the poverty is greater,
and the water availability is less than elsewhere in Indonesia. External
assistance of Java's water supply development is allocated by agreement with
Government to the Netherlands Government, the ADB and the Bank, who operate in
West, Central and East Java Provinces respectively. Like the first East Java
Water Supply project (Loan 2275-IND), the proposed Project will meet the basic
water supply needs of the population in priority cities and towns.
5.02      Providing safe, reliable water to larger portion of the population
is the main purpose of the Project, but emphasis is also placed on the
achievement of sound institutional and overall financial policies for the
sector outlined in para. 1.08, the strengthening of DAB and other sector
institutions and the establishment of financially viable and effectively
managed PDAMs.
5.03      The systems to be installed under Part A o' thie Project are designed
for low cost and rapid implementation, and will reach she poor at affordable
prices. They represent the least cost method of providing a basic water
service. The average cost per capita served of the systems for the 12 BNA
towns is Rp 61,000 at mid-1985 price levels including taxes (Rp 74,600
including price contingencies). The 63 IKK systems are considerably cheaper
and average Rp 30,100 per capita at mid-1985 price levels (Rp 36,600 with
price contingencies). It should be noted, however, that these costs do not
include the costs of the existing test wells which will be converted to
production wells. The IKK cost per capita at the mid-1985 base would be about
Rp 32,300 if these wells were not already available.



- 36 -
5.04      Under Part B of the Project, the level of service in Surabaya, which
is currently characterized by interruption and low water pressure as a resuLt
of inadequate sources, will be improved. The source and other components have
been selected and sized on Least cost basis while bearing in mind GOI's
request to allow for the anticipated expansion of the plant, up to an eventual
possible capacity of 5 m3/s. Taken together with the recent reduction in
rates charged to the poorer members of the community and the continuing
program to install more public taps (para. 2.16) the project is expected to
have a significant impact on the urban poor.
B. Marginal Cost
5.05      For Part A BNA/IKK PDAMs, the long-term marginal cost of water was
estimated using long-run Average Incremental Cost (AIC) at a 10% discount
rate. The AIC for the tweLve PDAM's is estimated (in 1985 prices) at Rp 335
(US$0.30 equivalent) per mn compared with the proposed average tariff (in 1985
prices) of Rp 150 (US$0.14 equivalent) per m . The large disparity in the
average tariff and the AIC is because a large proportion of the water sales
are to low-income consumers for whom low tariffs within affordability limits
would promote the use of safe water to people who would otherwise rely on
unsafe alternative sources. However, under the tariff structure guidelines
char9es for commercial, industrial and residential users consuming more than
30 m per month would, in the majority of the PDAMs, exceed AIC (as seen for
Part B of this project). Higher tariffs than those proposed are not consid-
ered feasible until consumer confidence in the new system is established. The
AIC's for BNA/IKK PDAM are presented in Annex 13.
5.06      Por Part B Surabaya, at 10% discount rate the AIC is estimaSed at
Rp 198/m3 at 1985 price levels. The present average tariff (Rp 250/mi at 1985
price levels) is substantially above the estimated AIC because the charged
rate will cover not only operating costs and depreciation but also debt ser-
vicing and at least 30% of future capital expenditures necessary for expansion
of the utility.
C. Rates of Return
5.07      The Internal Financial Rate of Return (IFR) which is the rate of
discount which equalizes the present worth of incremental financial costs (net
of taxes) and revenues (at constant prices) resulting from the project was
calculated for each PDAM by aggregating subprojects within its boundaries.
Aggregation is appropriate because the tariffs are uniform within each PDAH
and there are no significant differences in the per capita cost of individuai
subprojects. The IFR is negative for most BNA/IKK Systems and 17.5% for
Surabaya.  The benefits of the project were the3 supplemented using as proxy
(a) the charge by the vendors for the first 3 m /month (approximately 20 lcpd)
and (b) average water charges for higher consumption. For towns where data on
vendors is not available, cost for constructing and maintaining wells and cost
of carrying water was used. ERRs so calculated range from 0.7% to 6.6% (aver-
age 4.4%) in BNAJIKK systems and 20% in Surabaya. A 20% increase in capital
cost with an unchanged benefit stream would reduce the average ERR to 3.1%,
and with a 5% reduction in the benefit stream, would yield an average ERR of



- 37 -
2.4Z (Annex 13). The corresponding figures for Surabaya are 17Z and 15.7Z
respectively. These calculations are not, however, a complete measure of the
economic rate of return because it does not adequately take account of all the
benefits which result from the new system combined with improved sanitation
practices for the present users in the form of improved service. GOI and the
Bank staff recognize that the rates of return for the semi rural BNAIIKK
communities fall short of the levels that wouLd be generally acceptable for
traditional urban water supply projects. However, justification does not rest
solely with the rate of return, because (a) it provides essential and safe
water supply service, at Least cost, to a heretofore unserved population
(about 90Z of whom are poor) living in semi-rural areas; (b) it will help to
improve the health and living standards of the population and (c) it provides
the means for strengthening sector institutions and replicable policies based
on basic needs approach. The project as a whole would yield an ERR of 11Z. A
201 increase in total costs with an unchanged benefit stream, would yield an
average ERR of 81, and with a 5X reduction in the benefit stream would yield
an average of 7Z.
D. Project Risk
5.08      Available data on willingness to pay for piped water in smaller IKKs
(i.e. population less than about 5,000) is not conclusive. There is some risk
that a part of the revenues from such systems may be slow in materializing.
The experience of several IKKs under first East Java Water Project indicates
oversubscription of available connections within the very first year (as
compared to four years connection build-up period assumed in the financial
projections). On the other hand, data based on IKKs elsewhere in Indonesia
indicates low willingness to pay due to available shallow wells and therefore
there is som: likelihood that all connections will not be subscribed within
four years of project completion. The share of total revenue from the smaller
IKKs in the two weakest PDAMs (Madiun and Pacitan) is about 10 and 11%
respectively. The impact of this is expected to be minimal. There are no
significant implementation risks anticipated.
E. Poverty Impact
5.09      Part A of the project would benefit about 820,000 people by 1991
through house connections and standpipes. The level of population served will
be increased 10 times, while present users will have improved water quality,
service, pressure and reliability. Ninety-three percent of the total
connections and 87Z of the distributed water will be for households with
government, commercial, industry, and social users receiving the balance.
About 90Z of the total population or 1.2 million persons in the beneficiary
towns are below the relative poverty level of $130 equivalent/household/month.
Because of the nearly uniform distribution of incomes across each BRA/IKK,
about 90% of the population served, or some 740,000 persons in the project
area would be poor. In Surabaya, about 1.3 million persons are estimated to
be poor, of which about 240,000 would benefit from the project. In total,
about 80Z of the urban poor in the project areas would benefit from the pro-
ject. In Surabaya, where the present charges by vendors are particularly



- 38 -
high, PDAM Surabaya [have agreed] to reduce the cost of water to low income
groups. About 67Z of the water produced and the capital cost of Part A would
benefit the urban poor. The corresponding figure for Surabaya is only 8X due
to large industry and commerce in the city; and for the overall project is
35x.
F. Environmental Impact
5.10 The proposed project will have a significant net positive environ-
mental impact and will improve the quality of life of persons in the bene-
ficiary cities and towns. During construction there will be some disruption
of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and earth excavation will increase sedi-
ment loads of storm water runoff, but these will be temporary situations
without major detrimental effects. After project completion the volume of
wastewater will increase, but this will be limited by reason of the relatively
low capacity of the water supply syst1ems; the expected volumes will be readily
handled by existing storm water canals and drains provided the urban
authorities take appropriate maintenance actions.
5.11      A major environmental improvement is expected to follow from the
effluent discharge control program to be implemented in conjunction with
Part B of the Project. Surabaya's scarce raw water resources are currently
threatened by high pollution levels in the Surabaya River (Annex 6), consis-
ting mainly of organic waste discharges (often illegal) by a small number of
large factories and the residential areas alongside the river. The main
sources of pollution have been identified and an action plan for reduction in
the waste discharges concerned has been agreed. Achievement of specific
progress with the action plan, namely; assignment of management and monitoring
responsibility; completion of preinvestment studies by the main polluters and
their commitment to carry out the recommended actions; and completion of a
study for improvement of domestic sanitation in areas adjoining the river, is
a condition for disbursement against Part B of the project. The program is
expected, inter-alia, to strengthen the institutional arrangements for
monitoring and control of industrial effluent discharges in East Java.
5.12      The Government is striving for improvements in the level of sanita-
tion within Surabaya and these are being effected by ongoing programs under
the Fifth Urban Development Project which is partly financed by Loan 2408-IND.
Subprojects within that project include extensive KIP environmental sanitation
works, solid waste management improvements and major drainage improvements.
Of relevance included also is the preparation of an integrated urban improve-
ment project for medium, small cities and towns in East Java which is likely
to focus on many of the project cities of both first and second East Java
Water Supply projects.

6.03      Signing of a subsidiary loan agreement between GOI and PDAM Surabaya
and achievement of agreed progress on pollution control in Surabaya would be
conditions of disbursement against Part B of the Project (paras 4.22 and
5.11).
6.04      Subject to the above, the Project is suitable for a Bank loan of
US$43.3 million equivalent, for a term of 20 years including a grace period of
five years.

BNA/IKK Water Systems and Demand Analyses
GOI Water Supply Investment Program
1.       WOI's investment program in urban water suppLy has evolved over past
REPELITA to become a highly systematized approach suited to mass-provision of
minimal standard systems intended to quickly overcome severe deficiencies in
water suppLies to Indonesia's 45 million urban and semi urbanized popula-
tion. The program, although ambitious in physical terms, is characterized by
modest service levels (Table A2.1) standardized designs, low-cost tec'inology
and decentralized implementation, as well as its emphasis on service to low-
income groups. The intent is to build systems which provide an essential
service at an affordable price, to use scarce man-power effectively, and to
demonstrate to consumers the benefits of safe water so the community itself
will take initiatives to extend and improve the service. Accordingly
facilities are of low cost design; design procedures are standardized; about
two thirds of the population served would receive house or yard connections,
the remainder receiving standpipe service; projects would be executed in the
provinces by local staff to the extent capabilities there permit; goods would
be purchased in bulk and distributed from regional and central stores; the
projects would be financed as grants and given free to the communities; and
tariffs are expected to cover operation and maintenance costs and, if
possible, the depreciation (although some sub-projects may be subsidized in
the early years of operations when there are few connections or in the poorer
areas where a higher tariff may not be affordable). For larger '-ities struc-
tured tariffs (based on the national water rate structure), are expected to
cover operation and maintenance costs, depreciation of assets, limited expan-
sion of services and full debt servicing in excess of depreciation.
East Java Water Supply Investment Program
2.        An early target in the GOI's program was the country's most populous
province, East Java. In 1982-83 the Bank agreed with GOI on a selection
process, planning and desiL  criteria, financing arrangements and operations
and maintenance standards._
Selection of BNAIIKK Towns
3.        Cipta Karya officials have stated that the following general
procedure was used in the town selection:
1/   See Staff Appraisal Report No. 4282-IND, East Java Water Supply Project,
April 5, 1983.



- 49                             ANNEX 2

(a)  East Java kecamatans reported on their needs for water supply, elec-
tricity, roads, etc. to each kabupaten local government (Bappeda
Level 2). The reports contained information on current water
availability and the problems of obtaining water, potential water
sources and the general health of the community.
(b)  Priority towns for water supply development were selected by Bappeda
Level 2 taking into account the information provided by the
kecamatans and other social and economic factors. The selected list
of towns for each kabupaten --as then sent to the East Java provin-
cial government (Bappeda Level 1).
(c)  Bappeda Level 1 in conjunction with the PAB office of Cipta Karya
compiled the overaLl list of towns to be provided with new water
supplies based on the individual kabupaten reports. In the case of
BNA selection, towns where PAB were already implementing, or
planning to implement, separate water supply schemes were not
included (for instance the kabupaten capital of Ngawi).
Additionally only one BNA town was selected in each kabupaten. The
List of towns agreed at provincial level was then forwarded to the
Ministry of Home Affairs in Jakarta.
(d)  Consultations between the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of
Public Works (through Cipta Karya) and the provincial government
(through Bappeda Level 1) allowed the final list of project towns to
be drawn up.
In the future it is proposed that selection should also distinguish between
towns of similar category and needs on the basis of those towns willing to
contribute a larger share of project cost.
Project Water Supply System Features
4.        Existing Facilities  Five of the twelve BRA towns currently possess
a limited piped water supply system serving a small percentage of the project
area population. The works are of varying age and range from the oiped supply
from Unbulan Spring to ?P.suruan, constructed between 1915 and 1917, to the
more recent works constructed since 1980 at Ponorogo and Pacitan. The older
systems are generally in poor condition and require extensive repairs. Where
necessary they will be completely r.eplaced iuring the project. Seven of the
eleven project kabupatens contain !KK towns located in hilly or even moun-
tainous terrain. Water availability at some of these towns is poor and piped
water supplies from spring sources have already been constructed. However,
the systems are generally in bad condition, the water ir sometimes dirty and
the supplies are not disinfected. Additionally, in extended dry seasons, the
present spring .ources are often inadequate.

5.        Most households in both the BNA and IKK project towns obtain their
water for drinking and cooking from dug wells located in the yard of the
house. These wells are sometimes fitted with electric or hand pumps, but more
often a bucket is used to abstract water. The depth of wells varies but
generally it can be said that dug wells supplies are deeper and more unre-
liable (or even impossible) in the hillier areas. In the lowlands, where
groundwater is shallower and more plentiful, the existing dug wells are
sometimes not suitable as sources. Wells are situated in the densely housed
areas of some project towns and close to the household's sanitary facili-
ties. Bacterial contamination of some existing well supplies is inevitable.
6.        Most households in East Java boil their water before using it for
drinking in order to avoid the adverse effects of contamination. Because of
this, households in some of the project towns in the lowLand areas, where
existing shallow well supplies can provide adequate quantities of water, are
usually unworried by potential water quality problems. It is therefore likely
that considerable efforts will be needed during project implementation to
inform people living in these areas of the benefits of the new piped water
supply schemes so that the desired number of connections required to make the
systems financially viable can be achieved.
Service Policy and Design Criteria
7.        The 12 BNA subpojects were designed in accordance with the former
Repelita III service policy of the Government of Indonesia and the remaining
63 IKK towns in accordance with the current Repita IV service policy. The
design service policies adopted for Part A of the Project are similar to those
adopted for the First East Java project and summarized in Table A2.2.
Project Area, Service Area and Demand Projections
8.        It was not possible to lay down a single, simple definition of the
project area for any town since there is generally no town boundary which
could be used; if kecamatan boundaries are used, the project areas would
generally be too large and would cover low density rural areas. Hence, based
on engineering judgment, settlements which could be economically served by an
extended town distribution system have been included as part of the project
area. Topographical features, population densities, the views of Government
officials and future development plans are all considered where these were
relevant to the Project.
9.        The people in the project area who will actually be supplied gener-
ally comprise those where the service can be provided in the most cost-effec-
tive manner. This was normally achieved by allocating supplies to the town
center and the most densely populated parts of the town, and then working
outwards until the target service figure was reached.
10.       On the above basis, the service area was chosen such that all people
within the area will receive a piped supply either by individual connections
or by standpipe. In certain situations (such as along a transmission main
supplying a town) households which are not in the project area can be supplied
at very low cost and source and transmission works have been sized accord-

ingly.  Similar provisions have been made for commmities whose existing water
supplies are endangered by proposed spring or wellfield developments for the
Project; in general standpipe installations are provided for these
cofhamities.
Demand
11.       Demand projections were made in different ways for the BNA and IKK
subprojects. For the BNA towns, population projections were made by the
consultants using census data; future population growth was based on recent
historical rates with local adjustments. For each subproject the area to be
served encompasses about 60Z of the area's total population (in accordance
with the BNA planning criteria). The demand was then assessed assuming the
combination of the various types of connections shown in the town. It is
likely that unconstrained demand would exceed these allocations, but under the
design criteria all BNA connections would be metered and the progressive
tariff structure is expected to inhibit excess consumption.

12.      The demand for IKK systems was also based on population projec-
tions. However, in accordance with standard CK procedures, the system
increment, service population and number of connections were then based on the
present values shown in Table A2.3 below.

13.       The design number of house connections provided for each increment
was increased during this project so that 70Z, instead of 50Z, of the service
population is now assumed to be served by house connections. Extra house
connections are likely to make the schemes more attractive to households who
already possess their own well supplies and who might therefore be reluctant
to use a public tap supply, and the higher income generated by extra house
connections should give IKK subprojects a better chance of covering their
operating costs. IKK connections, being unmetered, are simpler than BRA
connections, and therefore more easily affordable. At the same time a
significant number of public taps to serve the poorer members of the community
are still being provided under the revised policy. The flow to each IKK con-
nection will continue for 24 hours per day but will be limited by flow
restrictions on all house connections and public taps.
14.      The demand summary for the twelve PDANs and the expected number of
connections together with a breakdown of demand for each consumer type is
given in Tables A2.4, 5 and 6 below.
Project Components
15.      Each BRA system comprises a spring o_r deep weLl source, pumps and
motors where necessary, transmission and distribution pipe, service reser-
voirs, service connections, public standpipes (to serve poorer households) and
office and workshop space. Service connections are all metered.
16.      At least two wells are provided at each BNA town with a deep well
source so that a partial supply can be maintained in the event of breakdown
of, or maintenance to, one of the electric submersible pumps. Similarly two
pumps are provided in each of the three forwarding pumping stations required
under the project. Pipelines have air valves at high points and washouts at



-55 -                           ANNEX 2
Page 8
low points, and distribution systems are subdivided by gate valves into
manageable areas. Fire hydrants are also provided. Storage is provided by
ground level reservoirs or water towers set at the required level to maintain
the required pressure in the system. These are standard Cipta Karya designs
of 300, 500, 750 and 1,000 m3 unit size, except for the water tower substruc-
tures which were individually designed on the basis of site investigation
drilling results. Pumps will be operated manually where wells are sited close
together, or by float operated valve in the reservoir and pressure activated
switch on the pumping main when sources are remote from one another.
17.       Each IKK system also comprises a spring or deepwell source, pumps
and motors as necessary, transmission and distribution pipe, service connec-
tions, public standpipes to supply poorer households and a small combined
office and workshop facility.
18.       A notabLe feature of the IKK service connections is that they are
all fitted with flow restrictors. Flow restricted service connections enable
the distribution system to be designed for average demand and it is therefore
of lower capacity and hence of lower cost than a normal distribution system
which is designed to meet peak demands. Storage reservoirs and the need for
meters are also eliminated and costly volume based billing is not required.
Their disadvantage is that the house consumer cannot instantaneously draw a
large volume of water, thereby necessitating in-house storage consisting of a
small 20 liter clean water enclosed tank combined with a 300 liter open stor-
age tank. Public taps also have a 3.5 m3 tank to store the flow restricted
supply. Standby wells are not provided for the low cost IKK subprojects
because it is assumed that the standardized pumping units can be rapidly
replaced in the event of a breakdown. Pumps are controlled by pressure
switches and system pressure is sustained by a hydro-pneumatic tank. However,
many difficulties have arisen in IKK pilot schemns which highlight the need
for refinements in system design, more reliable operation and better consumer
information. Lessons learned to date have been incorporated in the proposed
project designs and model systems constructed in this way under the first East
Java Water Supply Project are operating reasonably satisfactorily.
W    sourcesAscts
19.       ALl 75 project towns are expected to utilize either spring or deep
well water sources. These sources were preferred because of the easier and
lower cost operation and maintenance that they afford compared with an
alternative treated river or surface water source. Where alternative spring
or deep well sources are feasible, selection of the source was based on a net
present value comparison of capital and operating costs and, where the cost
difference was marginal, on engineering judgment.
20.       The suitability of selected spring sources was confirmed by recourse
to existing records, by the measurement of flows during the dry season and by
field and laboratory analysis of water quality. Water rights were also dis-
cussed with local officials prior to selection of a spring source.
21.       The towns selected for deep well sources fall into two categories:
those in areas of known groundwater potential where test drilling is not



-56                             ANNEX 2
Page 9
required, and those in areas where test drilling is required to confirm the
availability of suitable quality water. Production wells at towns in the
first category will be constructed during the project impLementation stage.
Test drilling at the towns in the second category, however, was either carried
out during the former EJWS project or is being carried out during the EJWS 2
project. Out of a total of 31 towns requiring test drilling 29 towns already
had confirmed borehole sources by mid January 1985.
22.       It is possible that one or two of the outstanding test wells at IKK
towns located in the hillier areas may fail to yield satisfactory results.
Conversely if groundwater is proven at some of these difficult locations
(where drilling has never been attempted before) it may be appropriate to
attempt drilling at three other similar IKK towns where the selected spring
source flows are marginal.
Environmental and Health Aspects
23.       Sanitation is not included in the project but is being addressed by
other ongoing government programs including those of INPRES, (a presidential
funding source provided directly to provincial and kabupaten projects), and
the Kampung Improvement Program (KIP), which is a program to improve the
quality of crowded urban areas. Local health officials also run education
programs to try and improve sanitary practices.
24.       During the EJWS-2 project the consultants carried out a short
sanitation identification study at a representative sample of the project
towns. The aim of the study was to examine the need for improvements in the
present methods of wastewater and excreta disposal in the context of the
imminent improvements to be made to the potable water supplies.  The report
concluded that many people are utilizing unsuitable or unsafe water supplies
(such as rivers, or wells contaminated by being too close to sanitary
facilities) and that the introduction of safe, improved supplies under this
project will do much tc reduce the present incidence of preventable disease.
25.       The proposed project will do much to reduce the use of insanitary
sources for water supply. In view of the relatively small quantities
concerned there is unlikely to be a significant deterioration of existing
conditions due to the increased waste water discharges. At the same time the
report recommends that further improvements are necessary in both town
drainage systems (particularly at the larger towns) and in current sanitation
practices. Improved maintenance, cleaning and regular flushing of drains is
required so that wastewaters can be more easily removed from the urban areas,
and the use of correctly designed pit latrines and septic tanks (as already
adopted in ongoing government programs) should be rapidly expanded. Only then
would the current relatively high levels of water washed and sanitation
related diseases be reduced. Water borne fecal systems do not exist in the
project towns, nor are they expected to be installed because of cost and the
limited flushing water volume available to households. Pour flush latrines,
leaching pits and pit privies are the commonly adopted methods for fecal waste
handling, and these are supported by the Government KIP and INPRES prgorams
described above. A forthcoming proposed arban project is due to be prepared
during 1986, with funding from Loans 1653 and 1972, and would address
infrastructure deficiencies in medium and small-sized towns in East Java.

SECOND EAST JAVA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Surabaya Water Supply System and Demand Analysis
General
1.        The Karangpilrang water treatment project will provide an additional
1      of treated water to the city of Surabaya, the provincial capital of
East Java. The city is situated at the mouth of Kali Surabaya on the Strait
of Madura. The present population is estimated at approximately 2.2 million
of which about 50Z are supplied with potable water through the existing PDAM
distribution system.
2.        The basic concept for the project originates from the 1976 long term
water supply master plan for Surabaya. The report recommended a four stage
source development sequence utilizing water from springs located to the south
of Surabaya, followed by construction of a new water treatment works in the
Wonokromo area which would abstract raw water from the Brantas/Surabaya river
system. Improvements in source works and distribution since 1976 have broadly
followed the recommendations of the long term master plan and further exploi-
tation of the upland springs south of Surabaya and other sources is currently
being investigated. However, in view of the urgent need for water in
Surabaya, PDAM chose to give higher priority to a source which could be
exploited in advance of the major source developments. Abstraction from Kali
Surabaya in stages which would match the available finance was therefore
selected as the priority scheme.
3.        Studies and feasibility level designs for the Karangpilang water
treatment plant were commissioned in the second half of 1983 and, following
submission of the draft final report at the end fo November in that year,
extensive review and discussions took place with the PDAM and the Bank. This
resulted in final selection of the Bulu site near Karangpilavg for the intake
and treatment works. The final report, incorporating agreed amendments, was
submitted to PDAM in March 1984.
Existing Level of Service
4.        An analysis of PDAM Surabaya's current level of service is shown in
Table A3.1 below. Accurate records of the numbers served are not available
but the following estimates have been made by consultants:
(a) Residential connections: 74,000 connections supplying 85,550 m3/d;
assuming a per capita consumption of 200 l/head/d gives an estimated
population served of 430,000; and
(b) Public taps and vendors: 4,164 connections supplying 13,330 m3/d
and assuming 20 1/head/d gives an estimated population served of
670,000.

A5.       The total population provided with piped water by direct connection
or through a vendor is therefore estimated to be 1.10 million. Residential
supplies account for 57% of wIter sold by the PDAM.  Supplies to nondomestic
consumers total some 75,620 mI/d. The production capacity of existing sources
is 3.32 m3/s, equivalent to 286,850 m Id. From records maintained by the PDAM
of water produced and billed, the amount of unaccounted water in terms of
volume and proportion of total production in recent years is given in TabLe
A3.2 below.

6.        The main source of water for those without a piped supply is hand
dug wells which tap the shallow aquifer underlying the city. Water from these
wells is often polluted and shows a trend of increasing salinity levels.
Rivers and canals within the city are heavily polluted and their objectionable
condition deters people from using them as a source for drinking or cooking
water.
Existing Facilities
7.        Sources of Supply.  Potable water for piped distribution within the
city is obtained from two main sources:
(a)  Ngagel Treatment Works, which provides 3,000 I/s by treating raw
water abstracted from the Kali Surabaya at Jagir Dam; and
(b)  Pandaan and Umbulan Springs which provide some 320 ls of water
delivered through Long transmission pipelines. Gempol and Sidoarjo
are also supplied from these sources and consequently only about 200
I/s reached Surabaya.
3.08      Ngagel Treatment Works.  Flow rates in the lower reaches of Kali
Surabaya vary between 5 cu mTs in the dry season and 400 cu m/s at times of
fLood. The quality of raw water at Ngagel intake is poor exhibiting the range
of major parameters shown in Table A33 below.

9.        The first treatment works at Ngagel (Ngagel I) was constructed with
a capacity of 80 1/s in 1922. Since then it has been expanded in numerous
stages to its present capacity of 1,000 1/s. In 1963 the first stage of the
Ngagel II w-orks was constructed with a capacity of 500 l/s, and in 1969 it was
extended to 1,000 l/s. Construction of Ngagel III works was completed in 1982
and this added a further 1,000 ls capacity to give a total combined works
output of 3,000 1/s. Water for the thre works is abstracted from Kali
Surabaya immediately upstream of the Jagir Dam.
10.       Ngagel I treatment works comprises a multitude of small units which
include three separate sedimentation systems in parallel, six banks of rapid
gravity sand filters, and gas chlorination., The Ngagel II works was
originally fed directly from the river but difficulties in operation led to



- 63 -                            ANNEX 3
Page 4
the introduction of the two presedimentation basins upstream of the plant.
The treatment works comprises radial flow primary clarifiers, 'accelator'
clarifiers, rapid gravity sand filters and gas chlorination. Ngagel III works
fLow is fed through three presedimentation units and is then pumped to a flash
mixer prior to treatment by direct filtration and chlorination.
11.       During the feasibility study phase the consultant  assessed the
performance of the Ngagel installations using, amongst other means, turbidity
as a parameter to define the overall efficiency of the treatment provided by
the three plants. In general, Ngagel I and II were shown to perform well
while Ngagel III was consistently less satisfactory. Trials are currently
being carried out by the PDAM to achieve effective coaguLation/sedimentationo
at Lhe Ngagel rrI works. The Level of operation and maintenance at the Ugagel
works is very high and the poor performance of the Ngagel III plant reflects
the lower standards which were apparently adopted for its design.
12.       Spring Sources.  Pandaan springs were first developedi for supply to
Surabaya in 1903. No treatment, apart from disinfection, is provided before
theflow is conveved over a distance of 36 km to Surabaya in a 450 mm diameter
gravity main. Umbulan spring was first developed in 1932. Water quality from
Imbulan is also good and apart from chlorination, the water does not receive
treatment. Flow is pumped over 75 km in two stages; initially through a 400
mm diameter main to Gempol and from there in a 450 mm diameter main to
Surabaya.
Distribution System
13.       The piped distribution system in Surabaya has been extended steadily
during the last 30 years from a total pipeline length of 184 km in 1969 to 502
km in 1980. The most recent program of extension. comprising 22 km of primary
mains (400 - 1,200 mm diameter) and 60 km of secondary mains, is currently in
progress under Bank Loan No. 1709-IND. The design basis fcr the latest
extension work incLudes for the distribution of supplies from existing
sources, amounting to 3,330 lls, and from future sources of 3,000 l/s. A
partial allowance for peaking of demand is also included and the proposed
increase in supply from Karangpilang can be distributed withlout further
extension of the primary network.
14.       The totai effective storage capacity within the system is estimated
to be only 6,000 m . Due to the present imbalance between demand and supply,
many sections of the network suffer from low or zero pressure during part of
the day and the provision of additioal storage capacity is justifiably
considered to be of secondary importance.
Population Forecasts
15.       Forecasting of the future population in Surabaya has been based on
the most recent census data and previous studies. The extent to which
previous estimates have taken into account such factors as migration and
-egional structure planning was reviewed by the consultant for the Feasibility
Study. The population forecasts adopted for project planning are summarized
in Table A3.4 below.

Future Water Demands
16.       In preparing the 1983 revised estimates of future water demands, the
assumptions of previous studies, principally the Surabaya Master Plan Study
(1976) and the Surabaya Metropolitan Area - Urban Development Planning Study
(1983), were reviewed and modified to take account of new data. These
included: recent and proposed rate- of providing new connections; the latest
production and supply figures; PDAM policy on provision of public taps and
data obtained from a brief field study of water consumption in two sample
residential areas. Water consumption figures adopted for the water demand
forecast were 200 l/c/d for residential connections and 20 l/c/d from public
taps.
17.       During the current project preparation, these demand estimates were
reviewed in the light of the current PDAM plans for installing new house
c--nnections. A revised demand forecast has been established, which is
summarized in Table A3.5 and detailed in Table A3.6. This forecast is thus
effectively a "constrained" demand, dependent on the physical capacity of the
distribution system. For comparison purposes, the demand forecast which would
resuLt from applying the current Repelita IV planning criteria has also been
calculated and is shown in Table A3.7. It can be seen that the "tconstrained"
demand is well below theRepelita IV criteria figure, even after the
substantial expansion in system capacity in the period 1988 and 1995. (MHMP
Tables 3.4 I and II).
18.       The proportion of unaccounted water is presently estimated at about
37% of production. For the purpose of orojected demand estimates this was
assumed to be a temporary condition, to be rectified by a program of waste
control, and a uniform figure of 25% of production was adopted. The PDAM is
currently preparing to engage consultants to recommend procedures for limiting
unaccounted water to acceptable levels through leakage control, meter replace-
ment and reductiors in administrative losses.

The Proposed Scheme
19.       Several options for development of new source works for water
suppLies to Surabaya were identified in the 1976 Master A4an Report,
including: increased abstraction from the Brantas Basin, use of upland spring
sources, groundwater and abstraction from Kali Bengawan Solo. Groundwater was
shown to be of low potential, development of spring sources would require more
time than surface watc -nurces and abstraction from the Brantas Basin was
shown to be the least -    alternative for surface water abstraction.  Kali
Surabaya was selected as the source after consideration of water management
systems in the Brantas Basin and pollution problems.
20.       The 1983 feasibiLity study examined three possible treatment works
sites on Kali Surabaya; Kebonagung (6.5 km upstream from Ngagel Treatment
Works), Bulu (10.5 km from Igagel) andKrikilan (21.5 km from Jgagel).  Raw
water quality was a key factor affecting selection of the recommended site. A
marked decline in water wuality and increasing risk of major industrial
pollution incidents, for sites close to Surabaya, were idrntified in earlier
studies and confirmed by a further program of sampling and analysis carried
out in 1983.
21.       Selection of the least cost option (the site at Bulu) was
recoimended provided that satisfactory pollution control measures are
enforced. This approach is considered reasonable since these measures are in
any case necessary to improve conditions at Ngagel.
22.       The principal components of the recommended Karangpilang scheme
comprise; river intake and raw water pumping station, presedimentation tanks,
flocculation units, clarifiers, filters, chlorinators, clearwater reservoir
storage, forwarding pumping station and a 7.5 km trnsmission pipeline. The
final layout of the seheme components will be determined during the detailed
design stage (due to be completed in June 1985).



- 66 -                           ANNEX 3
Page 7
23.       The river intake will be sited on the left bank of Kali Surabaya at
BuLu.  The primary and main treatment units are separated from the intake by
the main road along the riverside and will be located on an adjacent site
immediately north of the road.  PDAM are in the process of acquiring la3d
sufficient for the proposed 1 m3/s works and its later extension to 3 m Is. A
further extension t3 the site will be reserved to allow for possible long-term
developments to 5 m /s capacity.
24.       The proposed treatme,t process is a conventional one, based on
analysis of raw water quality- and operating experience at the existing
Ngagel works. The proposed clarification process will be based on the use of
upflow floc blanket clarifiers together with rapid gravity filters.
25.       The 7.5 km long transmission pipeline will have a diameter of
approximately 1,000 mm and feasibility study designs assume welded steel con-
struction with corrosion protection. It will be connected directly into the
new distribution mains which are shortly to be constructed on the west side of
the city.
Water Resource and Source Development Aspects
26.       Water shortage in the Lower Brantas delta occurs in the dry season
and a proposed agreement berteen the Directorate General Cipta Karya and
Directorate General Water Resources Development provides for implementation of
measures aimed at saving water at the same rate as required for supply to
Surabaya. The recommended measures inciude lining of irrigation canals,
repairs to lifting gates on Kali Surabaya and improvements to irrigation
operating procedures to Kali Surabaya. The costs of these measures are
included in the estimates for Part B of the Project.
28.       Studies and designs for further development of the Umbulan spring
source are presently being prepared by consulting engineers financed by
JICA. It is understood that since the Umbulan waters would benefit people in
a number of towns in addition to Surabaya, a separate operating authority may
be established from wh5ch Surabaya would be a major consumer.
29.       Under the long-term plan for larangpilang, abstractions from Kali
Surabaya will increase in stages to 5 m Is. Comprehensive resource
development is required for this increase and is being considered by the GOI.
30.       The water source development sequence adopted for the purpose of
preparing financial projectio s for PDAM Surabaya assumes a first stage devel-
opment at Karangpilang of 1 m Is in 1988 followed by a second stage
1/   Raw water quality in Kali Surabaya does not currently meet WHO standards
for raw water to be used for drinking water purposes. Industrial and
fecal pollution parameters exceed reasonable levels and legal limits but
GOI has formulated an action plant to abate the problems in Kali Surabaya
prior to commissioning of the new plant. Details of the action plan are
given in Annex 6.

SECOND EAST JAVA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Training Component
1.        Cipta Karya's training strategy for the urban sector is consistent
with GOI policy to provide regional autonomy through development projects and,
also, with the Bank's aim to assist institutional development within the
sector. The First East Java Water Supply Project included a substantial
training component (Loan 2275-IND) that is still ongoing. When completed the
training component will have assisted CK in:
(a) establishing a permanent provincial training unit (PTU) in East
Java, capable of meeting not only the immediate training needs of
the project beneficiary cities and towns, but also able to support
long term provincial training for planning, design, construction,
management, operation and maintenance of water supply enterprises,
and
(b) strengthening the manpower development of the Directorate of Water
SuppLy (DAB) in Jakarta through part-financing of the Human
Resources )evelopment Project (HRDP), thus enabling DAB to give
greater support to the regions, for instance in the provision of
training materials, training of trainers etc.
2.        Specific training activities under Loan 2275 in relation to the dual
objectives outlined above are listed as follows:
(a) Part-financing (together with Australian Aid and GOI) of a team of
consultants operating in East Java who will (amongst other things):
-    establish a PTU capable of serving the whole East Java region.
-    give institutional support to the 8 PDAMs which incltude 50
towns in the First East Java Water Supply Project.
-    provide classroom training for personnel of the 50 towns (an
activity in which other water enterprises will be invited to
participate, up to the limit of available funds).
-    provide in-service training for the same 50 towns.
(b) Financing of a two-year contract fox an expatriate manpower
development expert, based in the DAB Jakarta.
(c) Part-financing (together with Netherlands Aid and GOI) of a team of
consultants in the Human Resources Development Project (HRDP) in
Jakarta, which is strengthening central activities, especially the
development of training materials and training programmes.



-70 -                               ANNEX 4
Page 2
(d) Financing of local consultants to increase the training
opportunities ava ilable to the regions, in the form of "classroom"
and "in-service" training.
Proposed Training Component
3.        The training component of the Second East Java Water Supply Project
will continue to develop and reinforce the dual training objectives of the
First Project.  Additionally it will assist CK to implement more rapidly its
broad long-term Sector training strategy by financing the establishment of
PTUs in other provinces.  The objective will be to create PTUs in locations
suitable for their subsequent development as Regional Training Centers. The
scope of the Proposed Training Component would include the following elements:
(a) East Java Activities
(i)   Identification of training needs and provision of formal
training for personnel involved in the Second East Java
Project including, but not necessarily limited to:
-   staff of Provincial/Kabupaten Public Works
-   staff of PNU/-PIU
-   personnel of 12 PDAMS
-   contractors
(ii)   Development and expansion of the East Java PTU practical
training facilities at its location on the WIYUNG complex.
Ciii)   Technical assistance to enable the PTU to provide in-service
training to PDAMS as a follow-up to formal training
programs.
(b)  Central Activities
(i)  Extension of the HRDP to:
- provide support to increase the coverage of formal
training programs to reach target groups including water
enterprises staff, DAB staff, community groups,
contractors, and local consultants.
- develop the capability of DAB and PAB staff, and local
consultants to provide systematic, performance oriented,
in-service training to water enterprises.
-  training DAB staff and local consultants to assume the
role of HRDP.
(ii)   Development of training facilities at Pejompongan Jakarta,
as the National Training Development Center (training
laboratory, practical training workshop, cpgrading classroom
facilities).



- 71-                              ANNEX 4
Page 3
(c) Sectoral Objectives
To assist the estabLishment of provinciallregional training centers
elsewhere in Indonesia, for example, by establishing a PTU at
Semarang, and upgrading existing training facilities at Medan, Ujung
Pandang (Sulawesi), and Bandung, to PTU standards.
Training BeneficiariLs and Support Requirements
4.        Part A of the Project will establish water supply systems in 12
major towns and 63 smaller towns (IKK), all of which are located within 11
Kabupaten. Only 4 of the "mother towns" of these 11 Kabupaten are included in
the project.  A fifth one was a beneficiary under the first East Java Project,
and the remaining six already have water supply installations. However, for
training purposes the staff of these 6 towns will be included in the scope of
this proposal, as many of them will be key personnel in the management,
operation and maintenance of the subsequent Kabupaten-wide water enterprises.
Total staff members involved in these 11 Kabupatens could be of the
order 900 persons by 1988, of which the following should be considered as
priorities for formal training:
- Directors and Senior Managers             40
- Middle Managers and Supervisors          360
- Administrative/Clerical Staff             50
- Technical Operators                      120
Total                            570 persons
Other target groups for training are:
- Staff of Kabupaten/Provincial P.U.       100 persons
- PK.U/PIU Staff                            50
- Contractors                               80
In addition, it is envisaged that where spare places are available,
staff of other PDAM's in East Java will be invited to participate in the
training.
Output from centrally supported activities in Jakarta will include
25 additional formal t--aining courses per year and 20 additional "in-service"
training projects per year.
It is expected that Netherlands Technical Assistance will be
available to continue further support of expatriate consultant input into the
"Human Resources Development Programme (HRDP)" providing Government of
Indonesia will also continue its support. Here it is proposed to include
approximately US$1.3 million for local consultant and other support to HRDP.
Materials for the Consumer Education activities are estimated at $100.000.

SECOND EAST JAVL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
East Java Provincial Movitoring and Development Unit
1.        PDAMS are responsible to their district heads (Bupatis or Walikotas)
and through a lengthy administration chain to DDN. Substantive supervision of
operation and maintenance by higher levels of government are important
because, as experience has shown, for various reasons, PDAMs may not engage in
the best of utility practices due to shortage of funds, staff and experience.
2.        Periodic review of operating results of PDAMs under the Bank
financed projects indicates large amount of unaccounted for water; operating
losses; poor collection of water bills; and large accounts receivables
particularly from government agencies at most PDAMs. Review of staffing
indicates several vacancies at senior levels; high incidence of existing staff
who are not permanent employees of the PDAMs and are frequently withdrawn; and
lack of authoritative direction to support the organizational development of
PDAMs. In response to this urgent need, the government has agreed to assign
responsibility for monitoring and development in East Java to Provincial Cipta
Karya whose functions would include (i) provision of technical and financial
guidance and related implementation support to the PDAMs; (ii) supervision of
the operation, finance and management of PDAMs; (iii) review of an assistance
in the preparation of tariff and other charges; (iv) appraisal of investment
proposals and review of their priority and justirication; and tv) provision of
channels to exchange information on the improvement of systems and procedures.
3.        The monitoring and development function is expected to be carried
out at local, provincial and national level. Separation of functions at each
level is indicated below.
Local Level
4.        The functions of monitoring at local level is to enable the
Management and the Board of individual water enterprises to review, on a
regular basis, the technical and financial performance of their enterprise,
with a view to improving it.
Provincial Level
5.        The functions of monitoring at provincial level nre to enable the
Provincial Government, together with Provincial representatives of Central
Government, to:
(a) regularLy review the technical and financial performance of all
PDAM's within the Province;
(b) identify problems in individual water enterprises;.



- 73                                ANNEX 5

(c) provide technical and financial expertise in order to assist water
enterprises to solve problems identified;
(d) assist in appraisal of investment proposals and review of their
priority and justification;
(e) compare Provincial development targets with actual results; and
(f) provide regular reports and statistical information to Central
Government.
National Level
6.        The functions of monitoring at Central Government level are to:
(a) compare overall national, and individual provincial, water supply
performance with national targets;
(b) be able to respond to out of line situations, identified at
provincial Level, through the provision of additional technical and
financial assistance, which is beyond the resources of the province;
and
(c) obtain the information that will facilitate future planning in the
water supply sector.
7.        Monitoring function at local level is being developed as a part of
institutional development support provided to each project PDAM. Monitoring
at national level is carried out by CK and DDN. Consultants funded under Loan
2275-IND are working with the two agencies to assist them in effectiveLy
carrying out the monitoring function. The monitoring at provincial level has
been almost non-existant and deserves special attention. The arrangements
described below have been developed following a study by the consultants
referred above.
8.        Experience has shown that in order for the monitoring unit to get
access to central government support and funding, it must be a project of
Cipta Karya. This would also permit the recruitment of suitably qualified and
experienced staff by being able to offer adequate salaries. At the same time,
in order to obrain the involvement and authority of Provincial Government,
without which it will be difficult to function effectively, it should be
headed directly by the Chief of PCK. Should the Head of the Monitoring Unit
be below the equivalent rank of Bupati, we foresee problems in obtaining
compliance from PDAMs. The Head of PCK who reports directly to Ranwil P.U.,
has sufficient seniority, authority to ensure that reporting procedures are
followed by PDAMs via Bupatis.

SECOND EAST JAVA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Pollution Control in Kali Surabaya
1.        The consultant's feasibility study report identified the risk of
severe industrial pollution occurring in Kali Surabaya and the adverse effects
this would have on the existing works at Ngagel and the proposed works at
Karangpilang. The problem is being tackled in two stages: a first stage
study, aimed at preparing recommendations for improvement; and a second stage,
for implementation of the recommendations. The GOI, through the DAB and
financed four Loan 2275-Ih-D, has appointed consultants for the first stage
study, in parallel with the design of the Karangpilang treatment works. The
findings of the consultants are as follows:
(a) pollution loads are generally higher at high river flows due to
resuspension of deposited organic solids;
(b) main pollutants are organic wastes (including oil and grease),
suspended solids, ammonia and coliform bacteria in excess of both
local stream standards and WHO recommendations for raw water quality
for drinking water purposes;
(c) about 19% of che organic pollution originates from domestic sources
and 81Z from industrial sources (of which 94% was identified as
emanating from just four factories); in all cases the discharges
exceed the effluent standards set by the East Java Governors Decree
No. 43/1978 as shown in the following table;
rd) the 5.ndustries concerned discharge about 80 tons per day of
suspended solids which have a direct effect on the design and
operation of the proposed Karangpilang water treatment plant;
2.        Design of the proposed treatment plant allows for dealing with the
levels of pollution identified but operation of the plant under such condi-
tions would cost more (mainly due to chlorine consumption) than if better
quality raw water were available, moreover the risk of contamination break-
through is possible at times of excessive pollution. In view of the limited
number of point sources of the pollution concerned and the illegal nature of
the discharges, it is considered appropriate that the existing GOI monitoring
and control system be empLoyed and strengthened as necessary to correct the
situat:.on.
3.        At the present time pollution control authority in Surabaya is
vested in several overlapping jurisdictions, including the Ministry of Public
Works (D.G. Water Resources Development), Ministry of Health, Ministry of
Industry and Ministry of Environmeat and Population.  The efforts of these
various bodies are being coordinated at the provincial level through the
recently formed Demography and Environmental Bureau (BKLH) of the Governor's
office. The role of BKLH is expected to be strengthened shortly and more



- 77 -                           ANNEX 6
Page 2
authority and staff provided in order to undertake its mandate more
effectively.
4.        Following consultations with KLH and BKLH, the Study Phase I
recommendations include an action program for the abatement of pollution in
Kali Surabaya upstream of the city's existing and prosposed water treatment
plants (i.e. over the reach between Ngagel and Mojokasri) in both the near-
term and the future. The near-term solution would be achieved through
implementation of an action plan aimed at abating existing pollution before
December 31, 1987 (i.e. prior to commissioning of the new ICarangpilang water
treatment plant). Future pollution wculd be avoided by more effective control
of effluent discharges through strengthening of the agencies concerned.
5.        In detail, the action plan would be managed by Cipta Karya's
Directorate of Environmental Pollution (PLP) in cooperation with KLH and BKLH,
and assisted by consultants. The plan consists of a preinvestment phase and
an investment phase for measures to be implemented by the four principal
industrial polluters and Kotamadaya Surabaya,. which is responsible for
sanitation services in the main residential areas contributing domestic
pollution. Comp'etion of the pre-investment phase is a condition of
disbursement against Part B of the project and will require:
(a) the four industries to: (i) obtain expert advice and prepare feasi-
bility studies (for evaluation by PLP) of the inplant waste
treatment and process changes necessary to limit their respective
effluent discharges to within legally-prescribed limits; and
(ii) commit to make the recommended investments and process changes
to meet the end-1987 deadline; and
(b) Kotamadya Surabaya to carry out, with the assistance of Cipta Karya,
a prefeasibility study of the improvements needed to domestic
sanitation in residential areas abutting the river and its tribu-
taries.
6.        The investment phase is expected to occur mostly during 1987.  The
industries' investments would be self-financed. The Kodya Surabaya invest-
ments are expected to be implemented and financed under the city's KIP
component of Loan 2408-IND (Urban V) during 1987. It is also expected that
the sanitation investments would be planned with the assistance of the ongoing
UNDP Urban Sanitation Investment Support Project i'US/84/005 (managed by the
Bank under the World Water and Sanitation Decade-related UNDP project
INT/81/047. The Governor of East Java isas already indicated to the four
industries in question that failure to comply with the end-1987 deadline will
result in punitive action by the Province as provided for in the regulations.
7.        Monitoring of the action plan and the performance of the various
identified polluters will continue under the control of Cipta Karya in the
meantime. Strengthening of local capabilitien to monitor, control and avoid
water pollution is, howerver, the aim of the Second Phase Study. For this
purpose, Cipta Karya is expected to hire consultants to refine and implement
institutional development measures identified during the first phase. The
measures would include reorganization of BKLH from its largely staff function



-78 -                            ANNEX 6
Page 3
into an effective operational entity and strengthening of its linkages with
and the procedures followed by the present agencies responsible for sampling,
testing and analysis, and enforcement. In addition, the capability of the
agency to provide technical assistance to industry in order to reduce waste,
conserve water and treat effluents effectively would be developed. The
outcome of the Phase II study is expected to be of national significance in
providing a prototype for replication in other industrialized areas.

ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
PART A - BNA/IKK TOWNS
1.        Financial projections are presented for each of the 12 proposed,
consolidated PDAMs in 11 kabupatens and one kotamadya. Existing waterworks
system in a kabupaten, although not included in the present project, are
included in the financial projections in line with the concept of a
kabupatenvide water enterprise. The financial projections for each PDAM are
presented in Annex 9.
OPERATING INCOME
2.        Water production.  For the project towns with new water supply
systems, unaccounted for water is assumed to be 15X of demand throughout the
projection period.
3.        Service Area Population.  The project area population for each BNA
and IKK town was defined in the design studies. The percentage of population
served refers to the percentage of project area population using public
standpipes and yard and direct house connections.
4.        Number of Connections.  The construction period, which includes
activities from land acquisition to the completion of installation of service
connections, is estimated to last from 1985 to 1990. It is anticipated that
installation of service connections will be started in 1987 and actual
delivery of water a year after. A gradual increase in population served is
assumed until the target number of connections is reached in 1990. For
revenue generation purposes it is assumed that whole year revenues from the
target connections for the new projects will be realized as follows:
Year 4         (1988)        -   10  of target connections
Year 5         (1989)        -   401 of target connections
Year 6         (1990)        -   70Z of target connections
Year 7-10      (1991-1994)  -  1001 of target connections
5.        Water Consumption.  For the project towns, the standard domestic
consumption rates are as follows:

Tariffs
6.        Average tariff for 1985 is based on either actual or has been 3
derived for new PDAM (using national structure and basic rate of Rp 50/M3 for
first 10 m of domestic consumers. A rate increase has been assumed each year
leading to the target rate required in 1991 on completion of the project. In
practice the local governments authorize tariff increases every three years.
Details about tariffs are given in Annex 13.
7.        Water Revenues.  The main source of revenue will be water sales,
including sales through standpipes. No specific charge is assumed for meter
rental or maintenance charges, administration charges or penalities for late
payments which are adopted by some of the existing enterprises.
8.        The connection fees will be as follows:  for BNA towns, Rp 50,000
for residential, government and social customers, and Rp 75,000 for comercial
and industrial customers; for IKK towns, Rp 15,000 for residential, government
and social customers. This will be collected in equal monthly installments
over five years without interest.

Operating Expenses
9.        Most details are available in socio-economic, institutional and
financial studies; sunmmary report which is available in project files.
10.       Personnel.  Personnel expenses are based on detailed analysis of the
number of employees required to operate each PDAM. The integration of several
towns and cities in a water enterprise results in economies of scale. The
number of employees required to serve one thousand connections is expected to
be about 11. The salary rates used are based on prevailing GOI salaries
(which are considerably higher than salary levels of small PDAMs) adjusted for
inflation.
11.       Chemicals.  Chemical costs consist mainly of expenditures on calcium
hypochloride for chlorinating water. They are based on the volume of water
produced, and are assumed to follow the inflation rates given below.
12.       Power.  This represents expenditures on purchased electric power or
estimated cost of generated power with standby units. Power expense estimates
are based on the volume of water produced and are assumed to follow the
inflation rates.
13.       Repairs and maintenance.  These are expressed as a percentage of
capital costs or on a lump sum basis for each kind of asset to be
maintained.  These are shown under the account "Materials" in the Income
Statement. Repairs and maintenance costs of the nonproject towns with
existing systems are maintained at the present level, but are adjusted for
inflation.
14.       Transportation costs.  These represent the costs of operating and
maintaining transportation equipment including fuel, servicing, annual
registration and insurance. Various rates are assumed for each kind of trans-
portation and are assumed to follow the inflation rates.
15.       Administration and general.  These represent office running expenses
such as the cost of office supplies, and other administrative costs and are
based on number of total personnel. Costs are assumed to follow the inflation
rates.
16.       Bad debts.  These are the portion of water sales which are assumed
to be noncollectible. They are estimated to be about 5Z. Given relatively
small size of the PDAMs, it should be possible to control the bad debts.
17.       Depreciation expenses.  Depreciation expense is calculated using a
straight line method based on the economic lives of the assets. For simpli-
fication, a composite depreciation rate is computed for each proposed water
enterprise, and applied on the revalued assets. The composite depreciation
rates in the PDAMs range from 2.87Z to 3.28%.
18.       Income Tax.  The financial projections are prepared using tariff to
recover operating costs and depreciation. No profit and therefore no income
tax is assumed.

19.       Inflation Rates.  The assumed rates of inflation for local costs are
8% for 1985 through 1990 and 5% thereafter. The estimated foreign inflation
is 5% in 1985, 7.5% for 1986, 82 for 1987-90 and 5Z thereafter.
Cash Flow and Balance Sheet Accounts
20.       Fixed assets.  The value of fixed assets for the towns included in
this project are based on the capital costs calculated for each BNA and IKK
town. It includes the equipment cost, civil works, engineering and super-
vision costs, land, physical contingencies and price contingencies based on
inflation rates applicable in the year of disbursements. The values of assets
of existing systems were furnished by each water enterprise. Eixed assets are
revalued using the local inflation rates.
21.       The costs of the subprojects in each proposed PDAM area are to be
financed partly from the loan to be provided by the Bank and partly from GOI
counterpart funds. The project costs will in effect be grants by the Central
Government to each water enterprise because after completion of the systems
the assets will be turned over to the PDAM.
22.       Work in progress.  This includes all ongoing construction pro-
jects. For financial projection purposes it is assumed that part of the
system will be finished in 1987 and commissioned a year after. The rest of
the system is scheduled to be finished by 1990.
23.       Cash.  In the initial years when the revenues would not be able to
meet the cash requirements it is assumed that the cash shortfalls (including
the Cash Balance to be maintained to at least match the equivalent of one
month cash operating expenses of the following year) would be provided by the
Government.  These cash deficiencies are shown as "Operating Subsidies" in the
Financial Statements - Sources and Applications of Funds.
24.       When a PDAM becomes fully operational it is expected that there
would be excess cash over and above that normally required for its operation;
this is particularly so for PDAMs where tariffs are set to recover operating
and maintenance expenses and depreciation. This excess cash, after
maintaining a balance equivaLent to about two months cash operating expenses,
would be reinvested in the PDAM. This excess cash is shown as "Other Works"
in the Financial Statements - Sources and Applications of Funds.
25.       Accounts receivable.  These are projected at about two months of
total water sales. Accounts receivable in existing water enterprises range
from about 1.5 to 2.5 months.
26.       Inventories.  Inventories of materials and supplies are project# and
IKK town was defined in the design studies. The percentage of population
served refers to the percentage of project area population using public
standpipes and yard and direct house connections.
27.       Account payable.  This was projected to be equal to two months
operating expenses excluding personnel cost and bad debts.

Page 5
28.       Equity IBRD Funding.  This account represents the foreign component
of the project cost which is assumed to be financed from IBRD loan. Since the
project funding is considered as a grant to the PDAM this is also treated as
Equity account. Equity-GOI funding represents Local cost of the project.
Actual IBRD lean disbursement will be done on basis of overall agreed
percentages.
29.       Equity.  The equity account represents the Government counterpart
funds in the project cost, Operating Subsidies, if any, revaluation surpLus
arising from revaluation of assets, and accumulated income or loss from
operations.
Part B. Karangpilang Scheme
30.       The financial projections presented in Annex 1' relate to the com-
plete operations of PDAM Surabaya. They are based on the existing framework
developed for the PDAM's audited accounts and assume that the Karangpilang
scheme is sanctioned, for commissioning in 1988.
Ot'erating Income
31.       Water production.  Water production is based on existing facilities
and an assumed expansion of the PDAM operations in Surabaya. Minor improve-
ment in the existing source is assumed in 1986 and this would slightly raise
the water production in that year. KarangpiLang Stage I (1 m3/sec), wculd be
commissioned in late 1988; full production is assumed in 1989. The second
phase would- add a further 2.0 m3/s in 1992.
32.       Unaccounted for water is currently es;imated at 36% of production.
In view of the determined effort of the PDAM management to reduce losses
(including a specific leakage program) it is assumed that the percentage of
this will steadily decrease over the projection period as follows: 1985
through 1987, 35%; 1988, 34%; 1989, 30%; 1990, 27%; and thereafter 25Z.
33.       Service area population.  In 1984 63.79 million m3 of water was sold
by the PDAM. The water was sold through about 103,000 connections. It has
been estimated that some 1.1 million people receive water from PDAM, either
directly or indirectly and this represents about 50% of the Surabaya
population. The rest of the people in the city get their water from dug
wells, rivers and canals.
34.       Numbers of Connections.  The increase in the number of connections
has been estimated as follows, based on PDAM forecast: 1985, 5,000; 1986,
4,000; 1987, 3,000. With the commissioning of Karangpilang at the end of
1988, PDAM is expected to step up its program of water service connection.
The rate of connection is assumed to be 10,000 in 1988. Beginning in 1989 and
thereafter, a 2,000 increase in the rate of connections over the preceding
year is assumed.
35.       Water consumption.  In June 30, 1984, PDAM had about 100,000
customers with residential customers comprising 80% of the total and
commercial being the second largest group at 10Z. The water consumption



- 114 -                            Annex 12
Page 6
pattern is detailed in Annex 3. It is assumed that the consumption pattern
will not differ significantly during the projection period.
36.       Tariff Rates and Structure.  The tariff rates and structure are
based on those currently used by the PDAM. Another increase is planned for
1988 which will raise the tariff to an average Rp 353/m . In line with
existing practice of PDAM to raise tariff every three years, the rates are
assumed to be increased in 1991 and 1994 using the inflation rates as the
basis. The new average rate is estimated at Rp 444 in 1991.
37.       Operating Revenue.  Based on the 1984 and 1985 water sales data, an
average water tariff rate of Rp 250/m3 has been computed. Operating revenues
thereafter are based on the average tariff rates given above.
38.       Connection Fees.  This includes design, connection and inspection
fees. From 1985 to 1988 these are assumed to be collected within the year of
connections. Starting in 1989, it is assumed that installments spread over 5
years will be allowed for 50% of the connection fees and the other 50%
collected in the year of connection.
39.       Other income.  Other income includes meter rent, penalties,
administrative fees.
operating Expenses
40.       Personnel.  Personnel costs include salaries and wages, incentives,
overtime and employee benefits. Personnel costs are based on the existing
manning levels of PDAM. At the end of 1984, the staffing level was approxi-
mately 16 employees per thousand connections. Additional personnel will be
hired for the leakage controL program, KarangpiLant Treatment Works, Stage I
and Karangpilang Treatment Works, Stage II and other expansion of the
systems. The increase in personnel renumeration rates is based on the
projected manning levels and is assumed to follow the percentage increase due
to inflation.
41.       Electricity, fuel and chemical costs.  These cost items are based on
the volume of water produced and cost rates prevailing in 1984. These costs
are adjusted for production Level and assumed to follow inflation rates.
42.       Repairs and maintenance (materials).  Repairs and maintenance are
non-personnel expenses required for the operation of the treatment works and
the distribution systems. The cost of distribution has been related to the
volume of water distributed. For the treatment works, this is based on the
capacity of the plants in operation and the volume of production. This cost
item is assumed to follow the percentage increase due to inflation.
43.       Bad debts.  Uncollectible accounts are assumed to be equal to 10% of
water revenues, in line with the experience of the PDAM.
44.       Other expenses.  This account consists of general administrative
expenses for such items as transportation, incidental expenses, fuel and oil,
communication, commission, public relations, education and training and



- 115 -                             Annex 12
Page 7
others. It is assumed that increases for these expenses are due to the
increase in number of consumers and the effect of inflation.
45.       Value Added Tax (VAT) introduced by GOI is assumed to equal 10  of
all operating expenses excluding personnel and IOZ of all capital expenditure.
46.       pgreciation.  Depreciation rates are based on existing government
regulations (Undang-Undang Nomor 7 Tahun 1983 tentang Pajak Penghasilan
beserta Peraturan Pelaksanaannya) issued by the Directorate General of Taxes
of the Ministry of Finance. A composite rate of about 8% based on the 1984
computation has been used for 1985.  For 1986, with the expected commissioning
of the new IBRD assisted distribution system (Loan 1709) the depreciation rate
is assumed to increase to 9%. This is due to the fact that pipes are depreci-
ated at 1OZ. For the rest of the projection period, the composite rate of 9%
has been used.
47.       Income tax.  The income tax levied on the PDAM is based on the
government tax law, Undang-Undang No. 7 Tahun 1983. The rates are applicable
as from 1985 and are as follows:
Annual Income                       Tax rate
First Rp 10 million                   15%
Next Rp 40 million                    25Z
In excess of Rp 50 million            35Z
PDAM has requested GOI for a reduction of the tax rate; however no
specific response has yet been received. It should be noted that the same
rate is applicable to commerciaL entirprises. For purposes of the pro-
jections, the above tax rates are used.
48.       Interest expenses.  Interest expense pertains to both existing and
projected loans that PDAM would incur in the future. The loan agreement for
the existing IBRD loan which was signed in 1980 provided for a loan of US$8.0
million and repayment was scheduled to start in May 1984. Due to the delay of
the project, PDAM made a request to GOI to move the payment date under
relending agreement to 1986 upon substantial physical completion of the
project and the request was granted.
49.       The new loan represents the amc'imt that would be provided by GOI to
PDAM, equivalent to about 80X of the total cost about 55Z based on relending
of IBRD funds and 25Z from GOI's own resources. The interest during construc-
tion has been assumed to be added to amount of the loan. Interest on foreign
KP 2 and GOI loans for both KP 1 and KP 2 is assumed to be paid when due.
50.       Inflation rates.  The assumed inflation rates for local costs are as
follows: 1985 through 1990, 8%; and thereafter 5%. For foreign costs, the
inflacion rates used are as follows: 1985, 5%; 1986, 7.5%; 1987-90, 8%; and
thereafter 5Z.

Cash Flow and Balance Sheet Accounts
51.       Fixed assets.  The values of fixed assets include estimates for both
the existing and the new treatment plants. The latter includes equipment
cost, civil works, engineering and supervision costs, land, physical contin-
gencies and price contingencies based on inflation rates applicable in the
year of disbursements.
52.       Work in progress.  This account includes all ongoing construction
projects. For 1984, the amount pertains to the construction project financed
by Loan 1709. Starting in 1985, this would include the Karangpilang Treatment
Works.
53.       Cash.  It is assumed that PDAM would maintain a minimum balance
equivalent to one month's cash operating expenses. It is likewise assumed
that excess cash would be kept by the PDAM. In practice such excess cash
would be either invested in income earning securities or deposited in interest
earning accounts, however, such income has not been assumed for projection
purposes.
54.       Accounts receivable.  Accounts receivable, net of allowance for
doubtful accounts, are currently estimated to be about 3.5 months of the gross
billings for water. On the basis of the current improvement in receivable
management, in particular the setting up of individual customer ledger cards,
it is assumed the accounts receivable would be reduced to three months of
billings. An updated customer ledger would enable PDAM to immediately
identify delinquent accounts for disconnection or further collection effort.
55.       Inventory.  It is assumed that the inventory account from 1984 to
1988 will be decreased to reach a level equivalent to nine months of material
usage based on the annual average material usage.
56.       Other assets.  These include deposits to PLN, guarantees, and survey
costs. The reduction of the figure between 1984 and 1985 is due to the final
amortization of survey costs. For the purpose of the projection, it is
assumed that this will remain constant over the projection period.
57.       Accounts payable.  Accounts payable is assumed to be equivalent to
about a half month's operating expenses less depreciation, based on the
previous year's operating expenses; this assumption is in line with current
PDAM experience.
58.       Other current liabilities.  These include miscellaneous liabilities,
and any previous years' tax liabilities of the PDAM. The balance of these
unpaid taxes is about Rp 1.5 billion. PDAM has had a number of discussions
with Ministry of Finance officials regarding the repayment scheme. The
reduction in this account between 1985 and 1986 is due to the assumption that
these tax liabilities would be paid off by 1986 in accordance with a PDAM
financing plan and the reclassification of deposits to income account, the
latter in accordance with the auditors' recommendation.

Page 9
59.       Long term debt.  Long term debt includes the amount borrowed by the
PDAM from IBRD for the Distribution Project (Lean 1709). Starting in 1986,
PDAM would start drawing funds from GOI for the Karangpilang Treatment Works
(KPI). Interest during construction has been capitalized (i.e. added to the
loan amount; at the same time, it is also added to the project cost).
Additional loans are (a) proposed GOI loan for KP1; (b) proposed foreign loan
for KP 2 plus Disttribution and (c) proposed GOI loan for KP 2 plus
distribution.
60.       Equity.  The equity account represents both the owners equity and
retained earnings.
Others
61.       Profit Distribution to Kotamadya.  For 1985, the profit distribution
of the PDAM to the Kotamadya set at Rp 665 miLlion. In consultation with
Kotamadya, it is assumed to increase at 5% per year.
62.       Payments to Others.  Based on the existing plan of the PDAM, the
profit distribution for others would be based on the 1985 amount of Rp 348
million with a 5Z increase every year until the end of the projection.
63.       Project loans.  It is assumed that IBRD will provide a loan for
about 60% of the project cost to GOI; GOI wilL on-lend these funds and provide
for an additional 20Z of the project cost. The assumed terms of the loans to
PDAM are:
-    20 year including a 5 year grace period
-    12% interest per annum
-    equal semi-annual payments
-    initial loan drawdown to be made in 1986 (from the National
Government) and the final drawdown in 1990
-    loan repayment to start in 1991
-    moratorium on interest during construction
64.       Financing Plan.  The financing pLan for the Karangpilang Project is
assumed to be as follows:
Expenditures
Total project costs            Rp 25,845 million
Sources of funding
IBRD  55Z                      14,066

65.       The projectzd disbursements schedule by agency per year, based on
discussions with the Bank mission would be as follows:

SECOND EAST JAVA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Notes on Economic Rates of Analysis
Least Cost
1.        Within the framework of the design criteria for the various pro-
jects, the selected designs represent least-cost solutions. For example,
alternative sources of water for the BNA schemes were compared using dis-
counted cash flow techniques (11% p.a. discount rate was used); distribution
networks were designed using computerized network analyses to ensure that pipe
sizes are not larger than necessary; where alternative options were available
for other components (such as service reservoirs) these were evaluated on the
basis of least-cost and engineering considerations. Similar approaches were
used for the IKK designs, within the framework of the standardissd design
method for this type of scheme. For Part B of the Project (Karangpilang),
components have been selected and sized on least-cost abasis while bearing in
mind DOI's request to allow for the anticipated expansion of the plant, up to
an eventual possible capacity of 5 m'/s.
2.        The flow-restricted IKK schemes offer substantial cost savings when
compared with the more conventional BRA schemes, although of course the level
of service provided is not as high. The relative costs can be illustrated by
comparing the average per capital costs (excluding taxes) of the two types of
scheme:
BNA:  Rp 55 400/capita        including allowance for drilled wel'ls.
IKK: Rp 29 400/capita         already installed, 1985 price levels.
If a large IRK scheme is compared against a small BNA scheme the
difference is even more apparent; for example Mantingan (capacity 16 i/s) has
average cost of Rp 70 300 per capita while Kauman (in Xabupaten Panorogo,
capacity 10 ls) has an average cost of Rp 22 000 per capita.
Marginal Cost and Average Tariff
3.        The economic analysis for Part A (BNA/IKK Towns) shows that tariffs
are projected to be substantially less than the average incremental costs
(AIC) as shown in Table A15.1. Average figures show tariffs to be about 45Z
of AIC; the corresponding figure for the First EJWS Project was 49Z. The
following factors contribute to the difference between the tariff and the AIC:
(i) Tariffs have been generally set to cover 0 & M costs plus
depreciation, with no allowance for a rate of return. AIC has been
calculated to include capital and 0 & M costs, calculated at real
discount rate of 10% (i.e. net of any inflation allowance). This
discount rate is substantially higher than the ERR calculated for
this project component (calculated at 4.4%).



-120-                             ANNEX 13
Page 2
(ii)  The AIC calculation takes full account of the timing of expendi-
tures; this is particularly important during the construction
period, wheD large outflows are not matched by inflows from revenue.
The tariff calculation, on the other hand, considers the project
when it is complete and fully operational with no adjustments due to
the project start-up.

4.        In case of Part B (Karangpilang) the tariff substantially exceeds
the AIC (1.31 times AIC in the main analysis). This is because the tariff for
Surabaya PDAM is set to cover not ony 0 & M costs, but also debt servicing,
allowances for future expansion and payments to the kotamadya and others
(including income tax) which is substantia'lly higher than 0 & M and deprecia-
tion. The rate of return for this component (19.3Z) also substantially
exceeds the discount rate used (10%).
Calculation of Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
5.        The calculation of ERR is based on a standard format which compares
actual costs (capital and operating) against estimated benefits. The benefits
are represented by two components:
(a) a minimum water supply allowance to all households and
(b) the remaining supply to all consumers.



- 121-                            ANNEX 13
Page 3
6.        For benefis (a), the minimum supply has been taken as 20 lpcd
(corresponding to 3m /month for a family of 5 persons); this has been applied
to all households which will receive a supply (i.e. house connections, yard
connections or public standpipes). The value of this water has been estimated
by considering alternative sources of water which they might have to resort to
without the project. In the case of Surabaya, there is evidence from the
existing situation that people in some areas are willing So pay very high
prices for their basic supplies of water (e.g. ap 1 875/m , ref para 5.2.6 of
Project Preparation Report). A conservative overall figure of Rp 500/m3 has
therefore been used in assessing the value of the first 20 Lpcd.
7.        In assessing the corresponding value for the BNA/IKK towns, it was
recognized that conditions vary widely throughout the project area. In some
areas where water is scarce, some people are making cash payments for basic
supplies, while in many other areas direct payments are unnecessary since dug-
wells close to the house can be used. However in all cases is clear that a
reliable supply of potable water has a substantial value to the people. This
can be considered in relation to:
i)  charges actually paid to vendors (In Pasuruan town, vendors sell
water for Rp 500/m have been found, giving family expenditures on
existing water sources of Rp 2000 - 3000/month).
(ii)  costs for constructing and maintaining existing dug wells and for
carrying water from the wells. Actual costs are likely to vary
widely depending on depth and standard, but if the total annual
costs (allowance for capital cost and operation) of a well is, say,
Rp 10,000 and it serves families with a minimul supply of 20 lpdc,
the cost per 3 would be Rp 91/m 3.  If the cost of carrying the
water3is related to a typical wage (of say Rp 1030/day), the cost
per m3 for a supply of 20 lpcd would be Rp 500/m even if the total
time for carrying is only  hour per day.
(iii)  Further costs are being incurred by most of the population because
they are boiling all water used for drinking; awareness of the
dangers of drinking unboiled water from traditional sources was
found to very high. The new sources to be provided under the pro-
ject will be chlorinated, thus making boiling theoretically unneces-
sary; however many consumers may choose to continue to boil their
water if they consider the chlorination process to be unreliable.
Thus there is likely to be a benefit on this account (in cash terms
or in health terus), but it is not considered to be sufficiently
specific to enable it to be quantified for the analysis.
8.        Bearing the above factors in mind, an average figure for the value
of the basic minimum supply (20 lpcd) in Part A towns has been taken as
Rp 400/m for the purpose of the analysis.
9.        The remaining supply to all consumers above the 20 lpcd allowance
(i.e. benefit (b)), has been valued at the average tariff which is expected to
be applied to all consumers within a given PDAM.

Part A - BNA/IKK Towns
10.       Economic rates of return (ERR) have been calculatd for each PDAM,
including all BNA towns and IKKs under its jurisdiction. This analysis is
considered appropriate since the per capita investment cost and the standards
of service are similar, the administration and management will be shared, the
investment will start and reach its design horizon within the same period, and
the tariff will be uniform for all towns in the same PDAM.
11.       The analysis includes operating subsidies by the Government added on
to investment, to cover cash deficits from the start of the consolidated oper-
ations until the PDAH's target connections are fully attained. Where possible,
tariffs have been set to cover operation and maintenance and depreciation,
starting in the PDAM's full year of operations. However, the computed tariffs
should be affordable by the community and the tariffs in two PDAMs have to be
adjusted downward to a level sufficient to cover operating and maintenance costs
and part of depreciation or operating and maintenance costs only.
12.       The ERRs shown in Table A.13-1, are low, averaging 4.4Z.  The ERR
indicates the economic justification for higher tariffs. However, lover
tariffs are necessary to keep water affordable and to promote the acceptance
of safe, publicly supplied water.
13.       The ERR using tariffs as a proxy for consumer willingness to pay
measures only a part of the project, since the water services provide minimum
amounts of water, e.g. up to half of the beneficiaries in some towns will be
served by standpipes, IKK connections will have flow restrictors and water
pressure will limit the volume usable by other connections.
14.       A typical analysis for Kabupatan Pasuruan is attached.  The analysis
of the other PDAMs is sumnarized in Table A15.2.
15.       These rates of return underestimate the economic benefits, because
they do not capture externalities which accrue to the community, such as
improved health and reduced morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, the water
carried from the well or purchased from water vendors is not purified and
lacks the convenience of piped water. In any case justification of this
project does not rest upon these rates of return, but that at a minimum cost
provides essential and safe water supply to a heretofore unserved population
(more than half of whom are poor) and strengthens sector institutions and
policies.

part B - Karangpilang Project
16.       The economic .rate of return (ERR) has been calculated for the
Karangpilang Project including costs related to distribution rehabilitation.
For the purpose of the analysis, the project has been treated separately from
that of the PDAM oper2tion.
17.       The rate of return has been calculated by using Rp 500 per cu m for
the first three cu m per month (at an approximate 20 lpcd consumption) and the
average tariff for the remaining water sold as a proxy for economic benefits.
These rates are conservatively chosen and substantially understate vendor
prices in Surabaya. The results of the ERR snAlysis indicate a high rate of
return (19.3Z) which is well above the projected inflation rates. The analy-
sis included benefit of water loss reduction relrted to Iarangpilang producton
only. The loss reduction benefit to the rest of the system is not included
which, of course, results in underestimating the benefit. On this basis alone
the project appears to be a sound investment. The current pricing for water
being adopted by PDAM is intended not only to cover operating cost but also
debt servicing and about 30Z of future capital expenditure (which together is
far in excess of 0 & M plus depreciation as in case of Part A).
18.       For purposes of sensitivity analysis, the ERR was recalculated using
a 2O0 increase in capital cost; a second one was prepared with the same
increase in capital cost but with a 5% reduction in benefits. Results show a
reduction of the ERR from 192 to 16Z and 15% respectively, thus indicating
that the economic viability of the project is not sensitive to price/cost
fluctuations.
