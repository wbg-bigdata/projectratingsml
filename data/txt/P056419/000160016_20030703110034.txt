3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

The project development objective was to facilitate the social and economic reintegration of ex-combatants
into civilian life through targeted, multi-sectoral assistance, validating, in the process, this innovative
approach for an envisaged follow-up operation. The credit was presented as a pilot operation (Learning and
Innovation Credit). The credit was designed to support part of an integrated program to demobilize and
reintegrate veterans into Djiboutian society and its economy. The demobilization aspect (payment of
separation allowance) was largely funded by France and the EU, and IDA's role was to focus on
reintegration.

Djibouti was wracked by civil war in 1991/1992, which resulted in major destruction in the northern part
of the country. Peace was formally declared in December 1994, some two years after the end of heavy
fighting. At the end of the war on the government side the combined strength of the police force and army
amounted to 17,000 in 1994. This needed to be drastically reduced for a number of reasons, not least of
which was the fiscal burden. At appraisal in 1998 12,300 ex-combatants from the government and 3,000
former rebels comprised the operation's target group. Of these 3,800 were to be assisted.

Djibouti, within its small size and modest population, comprises two main ethnic groups, the Afars and
Issas, located in the northern and southern parts of the country, respectively. The Issas, a Somali people,
form the majority and the Afars are an Ethiopian people. Most of the combatants in the civil war on both
sides were illiterate and unskilled. A very small number was female. Djibouti's borders are extraordinarily
porous and identifying veterans who are Djibouti citizens was difficult.

IDA's initial engagement in 1995-96 was to provide TA and institutional support to the government for it to
prepare its demobilization and reintegration program for submission to donors. This process was quite
successful. Although IDA provided the bulk of the assistance it did so in close cooperation with UNDP and
bilateral donors. The subsequent Djibouti Round-Table and donor partnership became a model for similar
exercises.

The context in which the project was prepared, appraised and implemented, however, was extraordinarily
difficult. Over the last decade and a half Djibouti has faced civil war, regional wars, terrorism threats and
drought. Refugees from neighboring countries make up a significant minority of the population. Over the
period per capita income has declined, poverty has increased and inequality become greater. Income per
capita declined 25% from 1984 to 2002. Between 1996 and 2002 relative poverty increased from 45% to
74% and absolute poverty from 10% to 42%. In 2002 almost two thirds of the work force was officially
counted as unemployed. Moreover, despite some progress, the regional disparities which underlay the civil
war have persisted, making reintegration of ex-combatants difficult. In sum, the economy of Djibouti is
incapable at present to provide sufficient employment for its people (including secondary school graduates)
and the refugees it hosts, let alone creating jobs for ex-combatants.

In light of the difficult context, the fact that the Bank Group's experience at the time with post conflict
matters was only beginning and that the operation included a number of innovative features, it was decided
to structure the operation as a LIC.

3.2 Revised Objective:

There was no change to the operation's objective (PDO) over its life, although there were some changes

(see below) to its components.

3.3 Original Components:

Component                                               Cost (in million)
SOCIAL MOBILIZATION                                     $0.16
ECONOMIC REINTEGRATION FUND                             $1.83
SOCIAL REINTEGRATION FUND                               $0.30
ASSISTANCE TO THE DISABLED                              $0.44
PROJECT MANAGEMENT                                      $0.44

For purposes of the project Social Mobilization was defined as acceptance of ex-combatants into his (or
her) host community, specifically through a communication campaign designed to support reintegration and
through economic and psychological counseling of the veterans themselves. Economic Integration was
defined as ensuring financial independence of ex-combatants for themselves and their households. The
Economic Integration Fund, the project's largest component, was to provide ex-combatants a mix of skill
upgrading, micro grants to set up small enterprises and advice on small business development. The small
Social Reintegration Fund was designed to build social cohesion in the ten poorest most affected
communities (in the north) through support to small social and physical infrastructure works, carried out by
the communities themselves. Assistance to the disabled, primarily artificial limbs and wheelchairs was to be
provided through Djibouti's sole general hospital (Peltier). Operating costs for the project comprised the
final components and would support the project's executive secretariat (SCER).

As a foretaste of what would affect the operation later during implementation, in the course of appraisal
there were violent demonstrations by former rebels who felt excluded. Equity of treatment of all
ex-combatants became, therefore, one of the guiding principles of the operation.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT                   $478,800                              S

Project startup was delayed for seven months while suitable management was recruited. A formal Mid
Term Review was carried out in December 2000 somewhat later than originally planned. The MTR
followed a physical attack by ex-combatants on the project offices and its vehicles in November 2000, in
the course of which a number of the veterans were killed and injured. The project closed, 18 months behind
schedule, in June, 2002.

Certain components and implementation arrangements were changed during the life of the project. At the
Mid Term Review it was decided to eliminate the Social Reintegration component from the project and
leave it to parallel organizations (Social Fund and ADETIP) to carry out these activities. There is evidence
that three other organizations did carry out these activities as foreseen in the PAD. Provision of services
and support to the disabled was shifted from the government administered hospital (Peltier) to an
international NGO (Handicap International). Social mobilization efforts were refocused from broad public



                                                     - 3 -

education efforts to direct support for the strengthening of veterans organizations. Finally, and most
significantly, the Economic Reintegration component was scaled back to provide only training, dropping
micro grants and small enterprise efforts.

3.5 Quality at Entry:

Unsatisfactory.

In retrospect this ICR concludes that Quality at Entry was Unsatisfactory. There are three reasons for this
evaluation. In descending order of importance. These are: overly optimistic analysis of the economy's
capacity to absorb ex-combatants; poor monitoring and evaluation arrangements; and overly complex
design.

Overly Optimistic Analysis. The PAD recognized appropriately that the highest risk to the project was that
the economy would not be able to absorb ex-combatants. It is stated that this would be minimized by: other
interventions by IDA and other donors to expand the local resource base(in parallel with the operation the
donor community in Djibouti was supporting a wider structural reform effort); monitoring resource
allocation mechanisms as to whether they disfavor ex-combatants; and by economic counseling and
referrals, which were designed to direct ex-combatants to existing and emerging job opportunities. In the
event, of course, as described above, the economy of Djibouti actually deteriorated during implementation
with predictable negative results for all Djiboutians, but especially for the mostly illiterate veterans. And in
the absence of practical ways to link the project to the wider reform effort, it meant that its benefits were
minimal.

Monitoring and Evaluation. The PAD recognized that Learning and Innovation Credits demand effective
M&E and a comprehensive M&E system was set forth in the Project Implementation Manual. Moreover,
since it was anticipated that much of the implementation would be client driven by local communities there
was a special emphasis on carrying out studies on communities for real time learning. This was to be done
through implementation of a "comprehensive management information system" run by the project
management team. This unit was also to create a base line data set after effectiveness and to require
quarterly reports from all affected districts. Although during appraisal a computerized management
information system was elaborated, it was not effectively implemented over the life of the operation.

Complex Design. While the PAD systematically covered the lessons learned from similar projects in other
countries, it integrated less fully the lessons of Bank Group experience in Djibouti itself. There are
indications throughout the PAD that implementation capacity in Djibouti is very weak and that especially
with a polarized tribal structure that community development is extraordinarily difficult. It is noted that a
previous Urban Infrastructure operation was rated HU and that other donors which were involved in trying
to help in this area were facing difficulties. While it was explicitly said that implementation would be
handled flexibly, the fact is that the number of alternative types of interventions exceeded local capacity,
resulting in the changes in components at the MTR.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:

The operation did not achieve its objective of facilitating to any significant degree integration of
ex-combatants into the economic and social life of Djibouti. In aggregate the active number assisted (2,926)
was less than the targeted appraisal number (3,800). A certain number of veterans were trained but there is



                                                       - 4 -

no evidence they actually were employed (anecdotally, it appears they were not) and a small number of
disabled were assisted. The micro grant component had to be cancelled after the violence referred to above
in light of the small amount of funds set aside for it and charges of bias in its allocation to individuals, who
tended to view it as a cash entitlement rather than a program to establish a means of livelihood. There is
little evidence that few, if any, of the former rebels benefited at all and it is reported there is resentment that
such benefits as there were accrued largely to former government troops.

4.2 Outputs by components:

Social Mobilization. Over the course of project implementation 23 veterans associations were formed and
supported. These associations continue to function and provide a useful forum for a number of veterans.

Economic Reintegration. Just under 3,000 ex-combatants were trained (of which 50% learned to drive).
Getting drivers licences turned out to one of the operations reasonably useful outputs as a number of
veterans have been able to become taxi drivers. Before the small business effort was ended, 20
entrepreneurs received grants. Doctors treated 141 handicapped individuals and 25 received either
spectacles, artificial limbs or wheelchairs. There is no tracing information on whether those trained found
employment and whether the small businesses have flourished.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:

Not applicable.

4.4 Financial rate of return:

Not applicable.

4.5 Institutional development impact:

Institutional impact is limited. With the closure of the credit the project secretariat was disbanded.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

Certainly much of the overall context in which the project was implemented was beyond government
control. The war between Ethiopia and Eritrea and continued instability in Somalia, which increased the
flow of refugees to Djibouti did not make the task of reintegrating Djibouti's own ex-combatants any easier.
In addition, general military uncertainty in the Red Sea region with attendant concerns about terrorism has
not been conducive to stability and growth. Having said this, however, a more aggressive economic reform
effort and poverty alleviation program by the Djiboutian authorities would have improved opportunities for
employment creation across the board and including veterans. This overall situation exacerbated the
unresolved political consensus which inevitably followed the civil war and which in turn led to the public
demonstrations and riots directed against the project management.




                                                       - 5 -

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

Effectiveness lagged for eight months, reflecting government's inability to mobilize staff for the Project
Management Unit (SDR). The initial Project Manager had to be replaced. Subsequently, project
management worked effectively within the overall constrained context (see below). The overall shortcoming
of government has been its inability to implement an effective poverty reduction and growth strategy.
Recognizing the challenges facing Djibouti (meagre resource base, unstable regional pressures and internal
political divisions), it remains the case, nevertheless, that the government could take a more focussed
approach to economic management and public finance.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

Overall, the project implementing agency performed quite well after an initial delay. Once in position it
proved flexible in adjusting to changing circumstances. It maintained good financial accounts and accurate
(if not extensive) data on project outputs.

5.4 Costs and financing:

Total project costs amounted to $2.84 million compared to $3.18 million forecast at appraisal. Government
contributions to the program over its life amounted to $103,000 compared to a forecast $80,000.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

With the closing of the IDA credit the project unit was disbanded and staff were let go or reassigned
elsewhere in the government. Under an ongoing EU program, demobilization payments continue to be made
to veterans, but all efforts to reintegrate them socially and economically have ceased. There is no ongoing
effort on the part of the government of Djibouti to continue the kinds of intervention foreseen under the
project, although there is a recognition that further cost to the military and police force are needed. In broad
fiscal terms the Government succeeded in reducing budgeted military expenditure over the life of the
project, although there are further steps needed to strengthen budget transparency, priority setting and
monitoring.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

None.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:

Unsatisfactory.

It is important to distinguish between two periods in the run-up to appraisal: an initial period of technical
assistance and design and a subsequent period covering the actual appraisal itself. IDA performed
satisfactorily in the first period and less so in the second. As noted above, IDA support to the government
to establish the demobilization and reintegration program, present it to donors and mobilize funds was

effective. During appraisal, however, and, indeed, perhaps because of IDA deep involvement in
preparation, it seemed more difficult to take an objective measure of the constraints to effective
implementation.

While there is no doubt that the intended objective of the operation was important, in retrospect one
wonders if it was driven by Bank/IDA concerns more than by the government commitment to reintegrate
veterans. In light of the fact that it actually only became effective some 5 years after the civil war, that the
government did not assign qualified management to work on it initially, that government financial
contributions were modest and that with the conclusion of the project there was no ongoing effort to
reintegrate veterans, one may conclude in retrospect the level of genuine commitment by the client was
limited. Second, project design seems based on hopes rather than pragmatic expectations of what was
possible in a very difficult environment. Specifically, while design took account of similar projects in other
countries, it seems not to have taken account of practical experience in implementing operations in
Djibouti, which had generally been poor. A simpler design with lower expectations would have been better.
In addition, a building block of the project - community participation to reintegrate veterans - seems overly
optimistic given the actual character of the veterans, deeply seated local antagonism and the obvious level
of frustration. Finally, the project should have taken better account of the possibility, as it turned out was
the case, the economy would deteriorate.

7.2 Supervision:

Satisfactory.

Project supervision was initially undertaken from Headquarters. However, in 2000 it was decided to shift
Djibouti from AFR to MNA, reflecting its strong ties to the Middle East, in order to ensure it received
more sustained implementation support. As a result beginning in 2000 supervision was carried out by staff
from the Sana'a, Yemen office. Travel from Sana'a to Djibouti is inexpensive and fast and supervision
missions were able to go regularly and for short focussed interventions. This permitted the Bank/IDA teams
to assist project management to adjust implementation arrangements as needed in the face of changing
circumstances. The central failing of the supervision work was not to be more insistent on the need to
develop and maintain monitoring data.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:

Unsatisfactory.

Regular and flexible supervision of projects can only rarely overcome operations which are not adequately
designed to reflect the local context.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:

Satisfactory.

The government prepared a comprehensive program of demobilization and reintegration which was
presented at a UNDP Round-Table and which formed the context for the project.

7.5 Government implementation performance:

Unsatisfactory.

There is no substantive evidence that the government saw this work as a high priority and, therefore,
supported it financially or wished to sustain what had been established.

7.6 Implementing Agency:

Initially unsatisfactory but at project end satisfactory. It is worth emphasizing in particular the effective
problem solving of the implementation team in the face of what were at times life threatening situations.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:

Unsatisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned

As the international community and the Bank Group in particular are increasingly faced with difficult post
conflict situations, a number of lessons from this experience in Djibouti are especially timely.

1] Dealing with reintegration of veterans will always be difficult. The experience in Djibouti shows that
deep seated antagonism, which indeed were the cause of civil strife, are slow to dissipate and the emotions
associated with war difficult to overcome. Demobilization is relatively straight forward to put in place but
the actual reintegration of veterans more difficult. It is made all the more difficult in those cases where the
veterans themselves are largely uneducated. As was foreseen at appraisal, the lesson is that, however
desirable it may be in principle, in the short term it is wrong to expect opposing sides in a civil war can be
reintegrated simultaneously in the same community. Reintegration into their own ethnic (in this case)
community must precede reintegration into a wider community. It is also important to treat each side in the
conflict equitably. Perceived preference for one side or another can, as it did in Djibouti, lead to violence.
This final point is a vital one, not only for the Bank in its design work, but equally importantly for client
countries in their implementation of such programs.

2] A positive economic environment is vital for a successful effort to demobilize veterans and reintegrate
them. As the experience in Djibouti shows, without solid economic growth and in the absence an effective
effort to reduce poverty, the needs of veterans are especially unlikely to be met. This does not suggest that
such efforts should only be undertaken after there is a strong record of solid economic management, since it
will hardly ever be likely that in any post conflict situation there will be a government in place which has a
demonstrated track record in this regard. It does suggest, however, that post conflict needs to be fully part
of a coherent country strategy in which there is focussed attention to policy reform. In the absence of that,
while it may be possible to demobilize, it will not be possible to reintegrate, and there is no role for the
Bank (demobilization can be left to bilateral donors).

3] Finally, LICs are an important tool in the Bank Group's arsenal of intervention. The Bank took a
calculated risk in the operation to try to assist a disadvantaged group in Djibouti. The fact that it failed
does not invalidate the usefulness of the instrument.

9. Partner Comments

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:


I. Au niveau de la préparation du Projet

1. Le programme a été préparé dans un contexte politique et économique difficile les accords de
paix entre les gouvernments et le FRUD n'avaient pas encore donné tous leurs fruits et la
situation économique et financière était tendue.

2. Le crédit alloué de 2,7 millions de US$ était insuffisant. En effet, sur les 15 500 anciens
combattants (12300 anciens combattants de l'armée djiboutienne et 3000 anciens combattants du
FRUD) identifiés lors de l'évaluation du programme entre 3000 et 3800 anciens combattants
étaient susceptibles d'être touchés par le programme. La demande a été ainsi largement
supéricure à l'offre. Il a été, par conséquent, difficile de faire comprendre aux anciens
combattants qu'une monirité bénéficiera du programme.

3. L'architecture du programme aurait pu étre simplifiée. Etant donné le contexte politique et
économique, il étrait prévisible que les différentes composantes du projet ne serait pas mis en
oeuvre sans difficulté.

4. Il est à regretter que toutefois la partie gouvernementale n'ait pas été souvent entendue lors de
l'identification et la préparation du Projet et que la Banque était plus soucieuse d'expérimenter ce
nouvel instrument (LCI) que de vouloir s'adapter au contexte local. D'où d'ailleurs, cette
position d'attentisme des autorités qui ne voulaient pas perturber l'exécution du Projet tout en
maintenant leur volonté d'apaiser le climat social et de renforcer la sécurité militaire.

II. Au niveau de la mise en oeuvre du programme

1.      Le démarrage du projet a été difficile.

        La première démobilisation par l'Etat a eu lieu en 1994 alors que l'entrée en vigueur du
PRAC n'a été effective qu'en 1999. Ainsi, la démobilisation n'a pu coïncider avec la réinsertion.
Ce décalage a estompé le caractère d'urgence du programme.

2.      De plus, le premier directeur du PRAC, étant devenu malade, le personnel a été quelque
peu dèmobilisé.

3.      La réorganisation du programme.

        Le projet a du s'adapter à son environment et aux obstacles auxquels il était confronté.
C'est ainsi que la sous-composante micro dons a été supprimé après un démarrage difficile et son
crédit réaffecté à la formation. De plus, la sous-composante génie civil confié à d'autres agences
mieux qualifiées (ADETIP, Bureau de Réhabilitation).

        Cette adaptation a été facilitée par la supervision continue de l'èquipe de la Banque

Mondiale basée au Yémen et dirigée par M. Gianni Brizzi.

III. Les résultats du programme

La section 4.2 du rapport traite des résultats du programme par composante.

1.      Concernant la réinsertion des démobilisés ayant reçu une formation, il est de notoriété
publique qu'un certain nombre ont eu un emploi : chauffeur de taxi, de camions, épiciers,
manoeuvres au port, commerçants informels, agents de sécurité. On peut estimer le nombre à 400.

2.      Promotion de la cutlure associative. Le PRAC a suivi à la promotion de la culture
associative. Pour la première fois à Djibouti, vingt trois (23) associations ont collaborées avec un
projet. Ces associations ont non seulement reçu une formation dans la gestion des
micro-entreprises et l'approche participative mais ils ont aussi encadré les démobilisés. Ces
associations fonctionnent toujours à l'heure actuelle. Quatre (4) auto-écoles ont contribué à la
réussite du programme.

IV. Conclusion

1. Comme déjà indiqué plus haut, le Projet a eu lieu dans un contexte difficile certes, mais à
l'avenir, le gouvernement et les bénéficiaries devront être entendus et pleinement associés dans la
préparation et la mise en oeuvre de ce type de Projet.

2. La Banque Mondiale et le gouvernement devront s'effeorcer d'adapter ce type de projet et le
dimensionnant en fonction de la réalité djiboutienne.

3. Pour l'exécution de ce type de projet , il est nécessaire de mettre en place une équipe
d'expérience dotée d'une certaine expertise dans le domaine aussi bien du côté des autorités que
de la Banque Mondiale.
