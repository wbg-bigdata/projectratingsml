MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHAD
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL AND LIVESTOCK SERVICES PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Chad for SDR 17.0 million, the equivalent of US$24.53 million, on standard IDA
terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance the first time slice of a national Agricultural and
Livestock Services Program (PSAP). Government will finance US$0.97 million equivalent, or four percent
of total project costs, and Beneficiaries US$ 100,000 or 0.4 percent of project costs.
Country and Sector Background
2.    IDA's program of assistance to Chad has been in "core" mode since 1992, because the country
lacked a good macro-economic framework. IDA has been implementing a minimal program of support to
alleviate poverty through activities that address basic poverty issues, place minimal demands on
Government administration and finances, make maximum use of non-Government capabilities, and improve
the prospects for long-term growth.  This program has emphasized operations in health, education,
agriculture, infrastructure, and energy that could yield benefits for future generations.  However, in
response to the opportunity presented by the realignment of the CFA franc (CFAF) in January 1994, a
stand-by program was approved by the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Executive Directors on
March 23, 1994 and the Economic Recovery Credit (Credit 2589-CD) was approved by the Bank's
Executive Directors a week later. Until June 1994, the implementation of this economic program was very
poor. Since then, there appear to be signs of strong corrections. The performance of the economy and of
the Government has improved significantly and there are now encouraging results. In terms of output,
1994 is expected to yield a sharp recovery with a 4 percent real economic growth spearheaded by the rural
sector. This reflects the marked increase in exports of livestock and gum arabic, good cereal production,
and a 40 percent increase in cotton plantings. Inflation was an initial concern, but has been contained
within the program target of 40 percent. The current balance of payments situation is consistent with the
program target, with a 4 percent increase in exports and a 22 percent drop in imports. With a large
increase in areas under cotton this year, a 35 percent growth in exports is projected for 1995. The current
account deficit is therefore projected at less than 20 percent of GDP, compared to the projection of 29
percent in the Economic Recovery Program. This has enabled external reserves to rise to a level of CFAF
43 billion, i.e. twice the level of last year.
3.    Chad has a number of positive elements to build and rely upon in bringing about the expected
supply response from the devaluation of the CFAF in January 1994. Compared to other Sahelian
countries, it is relatively well endowed with natural resources, especially for crop and livestock production
and petroleum reserves. Its official policy and regulatory framework is liberal, and although unofficial
barriers to trade, such as taxes levied by local authorities, and road blocks, have been common, these
constraints are expected to be progressively removed by stronger Government action. The Government has
also engaged in a positive, open dialogue with donors and exhibited a willingness to try new approaches.
4.     The Agricultural Sector. The agricultural sector, including livestock, plays a pre-eminent role in
the Chadian economy both in terms of its contribution to overall GDP and its share in exports. It employs
80 percent of the Chadian population and provides about 85 percent of export revenues. Over the 1990-92



2
period, the rural sector's direct contribution to GDP was 40 percent. If its indirect contribution to other
sectors of the economy such as transport were included, its overall share would have been about 75 percent
of GDP. Within the rural sector, agriculture is the dominant activity, but livestock also plays an important
role. Two-thirds of rural sector GDP and riral expoits are accounted for by agriculture; livestock, which
includes beef production, sheep, goats and camels, accounts for one-third. Cotton is the main cash crop
and provides 45 percent of the country's export revenues. Other important cash crops include groundnuts
(with marketable surpluses ranging between 50 and 70 percent of production), sesame and onions. Gum
arabic is also an important source of revenues and provides about 10 percent of total exports. Cereals are
grown mostly for home consumption, but important marketable surpluses for millet/sorghum (up to 40
pcrcent of production) arc generated during years of good rainfall.
5.     Despite its considerable potential., Chad's agricultural performance was poor during the 1980's,
compared with other Sahelian countries. For instance, the production of cereals - the most important
cropping activity- not onlv experienced very large tluctuations ranging from a low of 355,000 tons to a
high of 812,000 tons, but also was not as vigorous as in most other Sahelian countries. The annual rate of
growth in land productivity for cereals is estimated at 1.2 percent during the 1980's i.e. less than half the
average growth rate of other Sahclian countries (2.9 percent) during the same period. Several related
factors explain this situation. First, research and extension activities have been limited in scope and
purpose, focusing only on cotton production and animal health. Second, incentives for the generation of
marketable surpluses are reduced by the poor road network, which does not provide year-round
communication linkage between regions with high production potential, e.g. the Salamat, and the rest of the
country. Third, the crop marketing system for domestic and cross border trade has suffered from illegal
barriers (para. 3). These issues are being addressed by the Government, as part of a rural sector strategy
that was discussed wvith donors in the December 1993 Round Table Meeting (RT). Implementation of this
strategy is under-way with support from the Economic Recovery Credit (Credit 2589-CD), the Transport
Sector Project (Credit 2520-CD) and the PSAP.  A more complete solution to these constraints is
dependent on improvements in govemance, which will take a longer time.
The Agricultural and Livestock Services Project
6.     Project Objectives. The project is the first six-year phase of a long-term (15 to 20 years) PSAP
to enhance the supply response from the agriculture and livestock sectors focusing on extension,
participatory and adaptive research, and farmer organizations. The goals of the PSAP are to increase
agricultural productivity in an environmentally sustainable manner, to raise farmers' incomes, and to
rationalize the use of public resources in the rural sector. The specific project objectives are to: (i) reshape
extension into a demand driven service addressing farmers' and agro-pastoralists' needs, (ii) establish a
producer-oriented research base for agriculture and livestock and to strengthen research-extension-user
linkages; and (iii) strengthen producers' organizations through management and technical training.
7.     Project Description. The componcnts of the project are:
(a)    Extension - aimed at consolidating and improving extension services provided by the
Ministries of Agriculture and Environment (MAE) and Livestock and Hydraulics (MEH),
covering crop, livestock production, and natural resource management, gradually extended
to covcr most farming areas.
(b)    Research - aimed at identifying and resolving on-farm production constraints through the
participation of farmers, extension staff, and three interdisciplinary research teams derived
from, and backed by, the Veterinary Research Laboratory of MAE (LRVZ), the Research



3
and Agricultural Technology Directorate of MAE (DRTA), the Cotton and Textiles
Research Institute (CIRAD-CA), and regional and international research centers.
(c)    Farmer Organization - aimed at promoting farmer participation and self-management of
group activities. This component would involve training and technical assistance for
production and economic activities such as savings/credit management, crop and livestock
produce marketing, group management and distribution of farm inputs and maintenance of
agricultural equipment.
8.     The credit, which is to be disbursed over a seven-year period, would finance civil works, vehicles,
equipment, training, short-term consulting services, independent audits of project accounts, and incremental
operating costs. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$25.6 million equivalent, of which US$14.2
million or 55 percent are incremental recurrent costs; the foreign exchange component amounts to
US$12.57 million equivalent or 49 percent of project costs. Project costs and financing arrangements are
summarized in Schedule A. Procurement arrangements and disbursement categories are given in Schedule
B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of IDA operations in Chad are given in Schedules
C and D, respectively. A map is also attached.
9.     Project Implementation.  The project would be implemented by MAE, the National Rural
Development Office (ONDR), which is under the tutelage of the MAE, and MEH. The Director of ONDR
would be responsible for day-to-day management and coordination of the project and all technical aspects.
However, other institutions including the Pastoral Association Directorate of MEH, and DRTA would be
responsible, under the coordination of the Director of ONDR, for the execution of those sub-components
directly related to their respective institutions. To facilitate consultations and communication among the
various executing agencies at the national and regional levels, the National Committee of the Agricultural
and Livestock Services Project (CONAPSAP) chaired by the Director General of the MAE and composed
of the directors of the executing agencies, would be established. Each year, the Director of ONDR would
submit the project's activity program and budgets to the CONAPSAP for approval.
10.    Project implementation is expected to realize significant benefits from a substantial preparation
process begun in 1991, consisting largely of test operations for extension activities. Funded by a US$1.0
mllion Project Preparation Facility (managed by ONDR) as well as under the on-going IDA-financed
National Livestock Project (Credit 1912-CD), these efforts have produced encouraging results to date and
generated strong enthusiasm among Government technicians and producers. In addition, the considerable
participation of donors and Government in evaluating the test operations and developing the proposed
project has been highly valuable in securing Government's full ownership of the project.
11.    Project Sustainability.  The project places heavy emphasis on institutional strengthening of
Chad's extension and research systems. The strengthening of producers' groups would increase their
capacity to deal with issues relating to credit, input supply and crop and livestock marketing, thus building
up the nccessary forward and backward linkages that, combined with access to improved technical advire,
wvould ensure continuous improvements in productivity. Also, the national capacity to plan and coordinate
agricultural extension would be greatly enhanced by the project and the project would be a vehicle to
address the integration of the agricultural and livestock services institutions.  An institutional study
expected to be completed by the end of the second year of project implementation would provide specific
recommendations for the modalities of such an integration. These recommendations will be discussed and
an implementation plan issued as part of the results of the first biennial review of the performance of the
project. The Government has expressed its commitment to this approach in a Policy Letter on Extension.
With this integration, the national extension services would become a more efficient and cost-effective



4
system of technology generation, diffusion and adoption. Nonetheless, the need to cover the continuing
costs of maintaining public extension and research services will remain. A larger share of Government's
counterpart funds would be called for under a follow-up project, making up the second time slice of the
PSAP.
12.    Lessons Learned. Four valuable lessons for the design and organizational setup of the project
were drawn from the experience of two former Bank-supported operations-- the Agricultural Rehabilitation
Project (ARP) which was supported by Credit 1775-CD and closed in March 1992, and the Financial
Rehabilitation Credit (FRC) which was supported by Credit 1945-CD and canceled in December 1992, as
well as the ongoing National Livestock Project (Credit 1912-CD; PNE), which will be closed in December
1995. These lessons have been confirmed by the pilot operations that were part of project preparation.
First, because management and administrative capacities are limited in Chad, political commitment and
Government ownership become even more critical for the success of any Government-managed operation.
Failure to secure such ownership appears to have largely contributed to the poor performance of the FRC.
Second, the need for simplicity in project design and organizational setup cannot be overstated, given the
limited available coordination capacity. Government failed to properly coordinate and monitor activities
under the FRC and ARP because: (a) the FRC included two components that were very different from
each other (public resource management and cotton sector activities) and required completely distinct
management skills and experience; and (b) the ARP included a large number of components to be carried
out by several Government agencies from different ministries. Third, because of its limited implementation
capacity, Chad will continue to need technical assistance (TA) support. However, the design and amount
of such technical assistance has to be tailored to the specific needs of each individual operation. Under the
FRC, too little technical assistance was provided, for the ARP and the ongoing National Livestock Project,
the amount of TA appears to have been too high. The performance of the TA under the latter projects
made up of several resident expatriates appointed under contracts ranging from two to four years was
generally poor: some lacked the necessary experience to fulfill their mandate, while others faced resistance
from their counterparts, who viewed the TA as an imposition. However, a successful design of TA for
accounting and management support was carried out under the Livestock Project. Non-resident TA was to
be provided under a broad contractual agreement with a consulting firm. Actual use of TA was made
periodically, if and when local project managers expressed the need. After three years of periodic TA
support, the project is now entirely managed by local staff The success of this approach is mainly due to
the fact that the use of TA has been demand-driven. Fourth, the separation of extension services from
other commercial activities such as credit and veterinary services, appears to have contributed much to the
improvement of livestock extension operations.
13.    Rationale for IDA Involvement. Chad's agricultural and livestock production remains essentially
a "nature-based" activity, carried out through traditional practices with little reliance on improved
technology. Because of the vagaries of climate and pressures on natural resources brought about by
population growth, the rural sector's generation of economically sustainable activities has become
increasingly difficult. In this situation, rural producers need technical advice, backed by relevant and well
programmed research. IDA has been working with Government on formulating and improving policies in
the rural sector through the PNE and during the preparation of the RT. In addition, IDA has supported,
since 1991, the implementation of test operations carried out by ONDR and the Ministry of Livestock. An
adequate body of low-cost, proven technologies that were successfully diffused during the pilot phase are
now ready to be transferred to farmers and herders nationwide. Other technical innovations also require
further on-farm testing to generate improved husbandry practices.  The project would thus lay the
foundation for establishing, on a large scale, an improved extension management system. IDA has gained
considerable experience in this domain under the Agricultural Services Initiative in Sub-Saharan Africa and
is well placed to provide the necessary continuity in this institution building effort.

14.     Country Assistance Strategy.  The proposed operation is fully consistent with the Chad
Country Assistance Strategy which was discussed by the Executive Directors on May 25, 1993. Poverty
alleviation is the guiding objective of the IDA Assistance Strategy to Chad. By reinforcing agricultural
extension country-wide, the Agricultural and Livestock Services Project will contribute to increasing
incomes in the rural areas, and thus would be an important vehicle to reduce poverty. This project will help
farmers enhance their productivity and provide a strong supply response to the devaluation of the CFAF.
15.     Actions Agreed. Assurances obtained during Negotiations include: (i) use of agreed procedures
concerning monitoring, biennial reviews and preparation of the implementation completion report; (ii) audit
of project accounts, including the special accounts, by international independent auditors acceptable to
IDA, and provision of reports satisfactory to IDA on such statements within six months of the close of the
fiscal year; (iii) Borrower's undertaking to make adequate provision for counterpart funds in its annual
budget, provide such counterpart funding quarterly in advance, and deposit it into a Project Account to be
used exclusively for project purposes; (iv) use of Bank sample bidding documents; and (v) Borrower's
carrying out, by the end of year 2 of project implementation, an institutional study that would provide
reconunendations on the modalities of integrating the Agricultural and Livestock Services activities.
16.     Effectiveness of the credit would be subject to: (i) signature of contractual agreements between
ONDR and research institutions including the three local research institutions (DRTA, LRVZ, CIRAD-
CA) and two international research centers (International Livestock Center for Africa and International
Institute for Tropical Agriculture); (ii) establishment by the Borrower of a Project Account with an initial
deposit of US$50,000; (iii) establishment by ONDR of an accounting system acceptable to IDA, and
implementation of an action plan to strengthen its financial management capacity; (iv) signature of a
contract between project management and the Chad Agency for Public Works, under which the latter would
manage the procurement and supervision for civil works; (v) adoption by ONDR of a detailed procurement
plan satisfactory to IDA; and (vi) presentation by ONDR to IDA of the first year's training program for
project personnel.
17.    Environmental Aspects. The project is rated a "C". Chad is experiencing a degradation of its
natural resources in the Sahelian zone as a result of drought, and in the Soudanian zone as a result of
localized population pressure, erosion caused by wind and water, deforestation and loss of vegetation. The
project would directly support efforts to improve the sustainability of activities aimed at increasing
agricultural and livestock production, to utilize more efficiently the low quantities of chemical fertilizers
and pesticides that are being used, and to introduce improved cultural practices and herd management that
would halt or reduce loss of soil and vegetation. Such practices include soil conservation, water harvesting,
contour planting, minimum tillage, composting, agro-forestry and better integration of crops and livestock.
All of these measures would be environmentally positive.
18.    Project Objective Categories. Rural households, which represent 80 percent of the population,
account for the highest incidence, as well as the greatest depth, of poverty in Chad. Thus, the project's goal
to promote sustained agricultural growth is of prime importance in alleviating poverty as well as in
enhancing food security. The project would also make substantial efforts to reach female farmers. First,
extension messages will be addressed to those household members actually carrying out crop or livestock
production activities.  Second, the timing of the visits of extension agents will be designed so as to
accommodate the availability of women producers. Third, extension will closely collaborate with, and
foster the promotion of, producers' organizations. Participation of women in these groups, already taking
place in some parts of the country, will be monitored closely to ensure a steady increase. Fourth, a



6
concerted effort would be made to recruit women as extension agents and Subject Matter Specialists
(SMS).
19.    Project Benefits.  By bringing more productive and sustainable technology to 550,000
agriculturalAivestock producers and their families, the project should increase their incomes and well-being.
Benefits would likely accrue in the following areas: (a) accelerated adoption and diffusion of new
agricultural technologies, (b) better coordination and complementarity in the supply of agricultural services
by both the private and public sectors, and better responsiveness to adverse climatic conditions, as and
when they arise; (c) improved levels of technical skill and knowledge within the existing extension and
research agencies and at the producer level, including a better integration of women's needs into the
development initiatives undertaken; and (d) a greatly enhanced ability, within MAE and MEH, to plan,
coordinate and deliver agricultural support services to the rural sector. Such progress, particularly in
human resource and institutional development, would permit maximum utilization of donor assistance as
well as the initiation, by MAE and MEH's institutions, of their own programs.
20.    Risks.  The risks foreseen include:  (a) irregular and inadequate provision of Government
counterpart funds; (b) ineffective management of personnel; and (c) unavailability of qualified SMS and
scientists to upgrade the capacity of the existing pool of agriculturists. The first risk would be mitigated
through: (i) sufficient allocations by Government of counterpart funds to extension as part of the core
priorities in the Public Investment Program, and the opening by Government of a project account in a
commercial bank, to be used exclusively to meet expenditures under the project, and (ii) the deposit by
Government, into the account, of an initial amount estimated to meet its counterpart contributions for the
first three months. The remaining amount of counterpart contributions would be provided quarterly in
advance according to a schedule of payments agreed upon between the Governnent and IDA. The
improved monitoring and evaluation capacity to be established under the project would likely mitigate the
second risk; intensive Bank supervision support from the resident mission would further improve overall
project management. Finally, the risk related to the difficulty in identifying qualified technicians would be
addressed by: (i) the implementation of open selection within the two ministries to select the most qualified
and committed technicians; (ii) the organization of specific training programs for SMS and researchers
including short-term technical assistance to be provided by the International Institute for Tropical
Agriculture and the International Livestock Center for Africa; and (iii) the execution of biennial project
reviews aimed at correcting deficiencies in implementation.
21.    Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

Annex
CHAD: Portfolio Implementation
1.      Chad is in the midst of a political transition, with elections expected to take place over the
coming months. In January 1994, in concert with other members of the CFA franc zone, Chad devalued its
currency by 50 percent in foreign exchange terms. The supply response to the devaluation has been strong
but Chad failed to meet the targets set forth in the stand-by arrangement with the IMF, particularly as
concerns revenue collection. Progress was made, however, in the second half of 1994 and revised targets
were established.
2.      Overall performance of the Chad portfolio improved from FY93 to FY94. During the FY93
review, Chad was singled out for having three problem projects (30%) out of ten operations. During FY94,
corrective actions were taken to address this issue; as a result, the portfolio has no problem projects.
Disbursement performance has remained steady from FY93 to the present and a disbursement mission is
scheduled in FY95 to provide assistance in special account documentation.
3.      The major constraints for project implementation in Chad are: (a) the low level of internal
revenues, resulting in Government inability to provide counterpart funds and pay civil servant salaries; and
(b) weak instittional capacity and lack of skills for some project directors, particularly regarding
procurement procedures, accounting systems and auditing.
4.      Procurement processes and capacity improved in FY94. The Country Procurement Assessment
Review carried out in Chad in December 1992 led to concrete actions to develop a local procurement
capacity. It also helped to identify the following capacity-building actions which are now in place: (a)
petroleum import surveillance was contracted out to a private firm; (b) a two-year in-service traimng
program in procurement, financed by IDA, is offered to local staff; and (c) an implementation unit was
established in the Ministry of Planning to assist Bank-financed operations in the areas of procurement,
accounting and auditing and to monitor more carefully the timely availability of counterpart funds. IDA
played an important role in helping the Government to design the needed corrective measures to improve
implementation capacity.
