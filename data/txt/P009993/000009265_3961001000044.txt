MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION
TO 'HE EXECUTIVE DTRECTORS OF THE IBRD AND
TO THE DIRECTORS OF IFC
ON PROPOSED IBRD LOAN TO AND IFC INVESTMENT IN
BOMBAY SUBURBAN ELECTRIC SUPPLY LIMITED
FOR A PRIVATE POWER UTILITIES (BSES) PROJECT
IN INDIA
1.       I submit for your app-oval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed IBRD loan of US$200 million equivalent and proposed IFC investment
of US$68 million equivalent (A Loan: US$50 million, for IFC's own account;
B Loan: up to US$18 million, for the account of participants) to Bombay Suburban
Electric Supply Limited (BSES) to help finance the construction of a 500 MW
thermal power plant. and associated transmission and distribution development in
north Bombay. The IBRD loan would be at the standard IBRD variable interest
rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including five years of grace. The Government
of India (GOI) will charge BSES, a guarantee fee of 2.75Z per annum on the
outstanding amount of the IBRD loan. The IFC investment would have an overall
maturity of 15 years, including five years of grace, with the allocation of
maturities between the A Loan and B Loan to be negotiated after the US$18 million
syndication has been completed.
2.       Background.  India is one of the few developing countries with a
vibrant, if small, private sector presence in public power supply. There are
five private power utilities. Together, they provide almost five percent of
public supply. BSES is a distribution company serving the northern suburbs of
Bombay without, at present, any generation and transmission capacity of its own.
BSES purchases its power from Tata Electric Companies (TEC). The other private
power utilities generate at least some of the power they distribute. The private
power utilities are regulated by the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948, according
to which they may set their tariffs to recover their full operating costs,
depreciation, interest and a return on their capital base of 122. Their
individual franchises are defined in licenses obtained from their respective
state governments, which cover their geographic area of operation and a term
which is normally 20 years. The serious institutional and financial problems of
the state electricity boards (SEBs), which provide about 751 of the public power
supply, prompted GOI to formulate, in June 1990, new policies to improve the
environment in which the private sector invests in public power supply. The
incentives are in the right direction and GOI-IBRD/IFC dialoaue on the issue is
under way. However, the progress of reforms has been temporarily interrupted by
the change of administration and revisions in formulating the Eighth Plan. For
BSES, the incentives already provided by the Government of Maharashtra (GOM)
within the existing legal framework are adequate to meet the financing needs of
the project.
3.       BSES is a well managed, financially strong and technically and
commercLally efficient distribution utility. Forty-one percent of its share
capital is held by insurance companies, 182 by the Unit Trust of India (UTI), 4?
by other mutual funds, 8Z by corporate bodies, and the balance 28? is owned by
about 9,000 individuals. In April 1991, BSES issued convertible debentures of
US$47.5 million equivalent, which were%oversubscribed by about ten times. When
these debentures are converted into equity shares in 1992, the number of
individual shareholders is expected to increase to over 150,000 and the combined
shareholding of the insurance companies and UTI will be decreased from the
current 592 to about 51Z. Further reduction in the institutional shareholding is
expected to occur after the project is completed. BSES has no receivables
problem despite charging some of the highest tariffs in the country to



2
residential (-62), industrial (38Z) and commercial (162) consumers. There has so
far not been any consumer resistance, reflecting a willingness among Bombay power
users to pay higher tariffs as they are provided with reliable and good quality
power supply.
4.       GOM extended BSES's license until 1993 on the condition that BSES would
install a 500 KW generation project in Maharashtra and transmit the electricity
generated to consumers in its license area. Extension of the license until the
final maturity date of the proposed IBRD loan is a condition of effectiveness for
this loan. After a period of controversy, BSES obtained environmental clearances
from GOI and GOM for the construction of a 2x250 MW power plant at Dahanu, 125 km
north of Bombay. The units would be commissioned by early and mid 1995,
respectively. The proposed project is part of the least-cost program for the
Western Region. BSES has recruited a core management team and appointed
engineering and project management consultants acceptable to IBRD/IFC, to execute
the proposed project. BSES has also aligned its organization to meet the needs
of the impending expansion of future operations from its present distribution
role into a full fledged power utility.
5.       Lessons Learned from Previous Bank group Operations.  IBRD has made 31
IBRD loans (US$6.3 billion) and I8 IDA credits (US$2.3 billion) for power
projects in India. IBRD involvement in private investments in power development
includes loans to TEC for the staged development of the Trombay Thermal Power
Station near Bombay. Through its participation in the sector, IBRD has been
instrumental in the establishment and development of central entities,
particularly the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) whose performance in
project implementation has been satisfactory. IBRD also pursued direct
involvement with selected SEBs, which together with their state government, were
committed to reform in institutional and financial areas. However, except for
the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), SEBs' performance has fallen
short of IBRD's objectives. As a lesson of these operations and in view of the
magnitude of constraints facing the public power utilities, IBRD is amending its
lending strategy in pover projects in India. Unless power tariffs are increased
in real terms, bill collection is improved, and the management of SEBs is
strengthened, lending for power projects will be substantially reduced and will
be limited to support for: (i) viable private sector investments in generation
and transmission; (1i) the few better managed and financially stronger SEBs; and
(iii) innovative, small-scale developments such as mini-hydro and cogeneration
schemes. In addition, IBRD intends to continue its dialogue with NTPC and may
finance the most critical components of this important agency's core investment
program. Since FY89, IFC has made four investments in three of the five private
power utilities. All the projects are progressing satisfactorily.
6.       Rationale for Bank Group Involvement.  In the context of GOI's power
investment program, expansion of private sector participation is essential to
meet the overall investment requirements. The Bank Group's support for private
utility expansion would provide an opportunity for: (a) advancing the dialogue
with GOI on the policy environment for private investments in power; (b) helping
mobilize additional resources from outside the public sector; and (c) improving
the sector's financial and economic efficiency. As BSES is going to implement
for the first time a large generation and transmission project, the capital
requirements are too large to be raised by-this Company from the Indian and
international private capital markets for the longer maturities required by BSES.
IFC's involvement would help strengthen BSES's links with the private capital
markets and act as a catalyst in mobilizing additional resources. The proposed
IBRD loLn would help fill the financing gap and would also allow BSES to have
access to competitive contract prices under international competitive bidding.

7.       Proiect Objectives.  The project's main objective is to provide
additional generation, transmission and distribution capacity to meet increasing
electricity demand in the Bombay area, and maintain good service quality to
consumers. Other objectives are: (a) support GOI's endeavors to increase private
sector participation in the supply of power; and (b) assist BSES in its
transformation from a distribution company to an 4ntegrated power utility which
operates generation, transmission and distribution facilities.
8.       Project Description and Implementation.  The project includes: (a) a
thermal power plant comprising two 250 MW coal-fired units located at Dahanu,
including a flue gas desulphurization (FGD) plant as mandated by GOI's
environmental clearance;l (b) two 105 km double circuit 220 kV transmission lines
from Dahanu to BSES's license area and three 220/33 kV receiving substations; and
(c) strengthening and extension of BSES's subtransmission and distribution
system.
9.       The project would be implemented by BSES over a period of five years.
The project cost is estimated at about US$534.1 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange compcnent of US$179.5 million equivalent (34Z) and taxes and
duties estimated at about US$42.3 million equivalent. The total financing
required, including interest during construction, and the expenditures for the
working capital margin and issue of the convertible debentures, is US$653.3
million, of which the IBRD would finance US$200 million equivalent, 332 of the
total excluding taxes and duties. Retroactive financing of up to US$30 million
will be provided for eligible expenditures after January 31, 1991 (para. 12).
The IFC investment of US$68 million would be made directly to BSES and would
cover 112 of the financing requirements excluding taxes and duties. Of the IFC
portion, US$50 million would be lent from IFC's own resources (A Loan) and up to
US$18 million would be obtained through a syndication comprising participations
in an IFC B Loan and/or through parallel financing from other sources arranged by
IFC. The amount of the syndication is based on BSES's requirement of an overall
maturity of 15 years balanced with the shorter maturities available from
commercial sources. Pre-marketing inquiries by IFC indicate that-at the present
time there is a difficult market environment for syndicating funds with
commerciel sources, stemming from the market's perception of the country's
current economic and political difficulties. IFC, therefore, proposes to await a
suitable marketing opportunity after the 1991 General Elections for formally
undertaking the syndication of the US$18 million. In case IFC is unable to
syndicate the full US$18 million by September 30, 1991, IBRD Management would be
prepared to propose to the IBRD Executive Directors a supplementary IBRD loan
1/   The project was originally approved by GOI and GOM with a requirement that
an FGD plant would be built at plant start-up to reduce sulphur dioxide
(SO2) emissions. Analysis of available data shows that the project would
meet GOI. GOM and World Bank guidelines without an FGD plant. BSES's design
includes allotment of space for retrofitting an FGD unit if stack emissions
from the plant and resulting ambient air quality do not meet any of the
above requirements. GOM has amended its clearance along these lines, and
GOI is carrying out its review. If GOI decides to amend its clearance to
remove the FGD requirement, IBRD and IFC will not have any objection. In
that case, the economic internal rate of return would be marginally higher
at 262, instead of 25Z, and the average tariff levels would be Rs 0.03/kWh
lower. However, in case BSES will build the FGD plant, funds provided under
the proposed IBRD loin and IPC investment will not be used for this plant.
An understanding was reached that GOI will make a final decision soonest in
order to allow BSES to have the FGD plant, if required, in operation at the
start-up of the Dahanu power plant.

covering the shortfall up to US$18 million. The above date was determined in
accordance with BSES's procurement schedule. The major shareholders of BSES have
confirmed that they will ensure that the necessary finances are raised from
shareholders, public, financial institutions or banks to cover dny cost overruns.
A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key proiect processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in India are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
The Staff Appraisal Report No. 9499-IN, dated May 15, 1991, is being distributed
separately.
10.      Actions Agreed between GOI and BSES, and IBRD.  (a) GOI has: (i)
Reaffirmed the availability of adequate supplies of suitable fuel for the
proposed power plant; and (ii) Agreed to ensure that GOM willt (1) not take any
actions that would adversely affect BSES's operational performance and financial
position. including restricting BSES's area of supply; (2) allow BSES to collect
special reserves as are permissible, including a special reserve for repayment of
BSES's debt, at least equal to the difference between the principal repayments
and the depreciation allowable under the Electricity (Supply) Act; (3) through
the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board carry out the audit of BSES's
environmental monitoring program; (4) formulate and furnish to IBRD for review,
by March 31, 1992, a Tribal Development Program (para. 12) and carry out the
program in a manner satisfactory to IBRD; and (b) BSES has agreed to: (i)
conclude agreements relating to the operation of the BSES plant with MSEB and TEC
prior to the synchronization of the first unit; (ii) complete the subscription of
the second debenture issue not later than June 30, 1994, underwritten to the
extent offered to the public; (iii) establish and maintain a project management
structure satisfactory to IBRD; (iv) execute the security arrangements for the
proposed loan; (v) obtain IBRD's prior consent to incur any additional long-term
indebtedness, other than the loans stated in the financial plan, if after such
debt has been incurred the long-term debt-to-equity ratio exceeds 2.5; and (vi)
set its tariffs at levels sufficient to achieve the prescribed return on its
capital base and to recover through special reserves the aggregate amount of
repayments of principal of its debt for that year. Extension by GOM of BSES's
license to at least up to August 15, 2011, the maturity date of the proposed IBRD
loan, fulfillment of all conditions precedent to disbursement of the IFC
investment, creation of an equitable mortgage in a form satisfactory to IBRD and
execution of a Power of J 'rney in favor of IBRD are conditions of effectiveness
for the proposed IBRD loan. The terms and conditions of the Investment Agreement
between IFC and BSES are consistent with the above.
11.      Environmental and Social AsPects.  The plant complies fully with all
World Bank environmental guidelines and the pollution control regulations of GOI
and GOM. The main environmental issues which had to be addressed relate to:
project site, appropriate operation and maintenance of the plant, social impact
of the construction activities and plant operations, air pollution by sulphur
dioxide (SO ) emissions from the stack, potential effects of liquid effluents and
discharge ol the cooling waters on the aquatic life of the Dahanu creek. The
Supreme Court recently rejected a court action brought by environmental groups on
the choice of the site. BSES selected the Dahanu site after extensive and
thorough studies. There would he no resettlement under the project. BSES has
developed an environmental management program which covers extensive
environmental monitoring and social and environmental enhancement. IBRD/IFC h4ve
reviewed this program and find it acceptable. Agreements were reached that the
results of environmental monitoring will be audited and results will be made
public (para. 10). The overall social impact from the project is expected to be
positive. GOM will formulate and implement a Tribal Development Plan which would
provide incremental assistance to GOM's ongoing activities in the tribal



5
comnunities in the immediate vicinity of the plant (para. 12). The increase in
lb Valley coal production to supply the Dahanu project will reault in minimal
incremental environmental impact. An Executive Summary of Environmental
Assessment was agreed with GOI and is given in Annex 3.10 of the Staff Appraisal
Report (para. 9).
12.      Special Operational Emphasis.  (i) The proposed IBRD loan would be
mainly used to finance a single contract covering the main power plant package
(boil'jrs, turbines, generators, electrostatic precipitator, power cycle piping,
and control and instrumentation). This procurement approach was designed to
overcome BSES's inexperience in implementing such a large project. The contract
was awarded in January 1991, under international competitive bidding (ICB)
procedures in accordance with IBRD's Procurement Guidelines.  Advance procurement
action was duly notified to the Executive Directors of IBRD through the Monthly
Operational Summary. Therefore, retroactive financing will be provided (para.
9); (ii) the foreign currency requirements for direct and indirect imports for
the other generation and transmission packages (excluding the FGD plant) are
estimated at US$47 million and will be cunded by IFC; (iii) a tribal development
program to provide incremental assistance to GOM's tribal development activities
in the vicinity of the Dahanu power plant would be undertaken by GOM with grant
financing of about US$0.3 million. IBRD would help GOI and GOM to obtain the
grant from an external aid agency.
13.      ProJect Benefits.  The project would increase generating and
transmission capacity in the Bombav area and would help to maintain BSES's good
service quality. BSES's losses will be decreased following the strengthening and
extension of the distribution network. Bank Group participation would encourage
greater private investment in the power sector in India by mobilizing private
savings for the sector. The TDP would help to ensure that some benefits of the
investment would reach the local tribal community.
14.      Risks.  The physical project components, which are based on conventional
technology, do not represent unusual technical risks. The Bank Group is
satisfied that all necessary measures to mitigate the environmental and social
effects of the project will be implemented. Following the recent rejection by
the Supreme Court of India of the case brought by environmental groups for an
injunction to stop the project, it is unlikely that the case would be reopened.
Possible institutional risks include the inability of BSES to effectively manage
the implementation and operation of the project. To minimize this risk, BSES has
engaged competent consultants to manage the project. BSES's reorganization and
strengthening efforts will be closely monitored. BSES has been granted
permission to accumulate certain special reserves required in accordance with the
financing plan of the project and assurances were obtained from GOI that it would
ensure that GON would permit BSES to collect special reserves during the
operations stage as well, including special reserves for repayment of debt. BSES
would remain financially sound within the existing legislation. The promulgation
of the new incentives currently under consideration by GOI would generally
enhance BSES's financial position. Increases in BSES's fuel costs or in TEC's
tariffs would be passed on to BSES's consumers as allowed under the Act.
15.      The IFC Investment.  The principal features of the proposed IPC
investment would be as follows:
A Loans     US$50 million.  Fixed interest rate of 10.752 p.a.
Front-end fee: IU p.a.
Commitment feet 1t p.a. on the undisbursed halance.



6
B Loans     Up to US$18 million.
Syndication feet 0.50Z of the amount syndicated payable to IFC.
Administration fee: US$2,500 per participant in IFC's B Loan, payable
semi-annually to IFC; however, the total Administration fee not to
exceed US$15,000 annually.
Other terms to be negotiated.
Repayments A Loans  Repayment in 20 semi-annual installments of US$2,500,000
due from September 15, 1996 through March 15, 2006.
B Loant To be negotiated.
Overall maturity of 15 years, including 5 years of grace.
The maturity of the B Loan is expected to be shorter than the
maturity of the A Loan; in that event, the repayment installments of
the A Loan will be adjusted so that the aggregate repayments for the
A Loan and B Loan are approximately US$6,800,000 per year.
Securitys   For both IFC loans, first charge over BSES's immoveable and moveable
assets, including BSES's license, ranking pari passu with other
senior lenders' charges, subject to certain prior charges over
current assets in favor of working capital lenders. Partial
disbursement permitted against hypothecation of moveable assets.
16.      In accordance with Sectfn 3(ii) of Article III of IFC's Articles of
Agreement, the Government of India has been notified of the proposed investment.
17.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed IBRD loan and IFC
investment would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the IBRD and the
Articles of Agreement of the IFC. I recommend (i) that the Executive Directors
of IBRD approve the proposed IBRD loan, and (ii) that the Directors of the
Corporation approve the proposed investment by the Corporation on substantially
the terms outlined above and adopt the following resolutiont
*RESOLVEDs
(a)   That the Corporation be authorized to conclude the transactions outlined
in paragraph 15 of this report substantially on the terms therein set
forth; and
(b)   That the President, Executive Vice President or any staff member of the
Corporation authorized by any one of them, enter into an agreement or
agreements providing for such transactions and containing such other
terms and conditions as he or she, by the execution thereof, shall
approve."
