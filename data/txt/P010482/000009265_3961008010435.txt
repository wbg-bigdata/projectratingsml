MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A
BALOCEIISTAN COMMUNITY IRRIGATION AND AGRICULTURE PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for SDR 18.5 million, the equivalent of US$26.7
million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 35 years to help finance a project for developing
Balochistan's community irrigation and agriculture. The Government of the Netherlands (GON) would
cofinance the project, and would provide a grant equivalent to US$5.4 million.
2.           Country/Sector Background. Because of its extreme aridity, cropping is not possible
in Balochistan without some form of irrigation. Water, not land, limits agricultural development.
Balochistan's water resources, however, are meager, and are often developed and used inefficiently.
3.           Balochistan is Pakistan's biggest but least developed province, having 44 % (some 350,000
km2) of the land area but only about 6% (around 7 million) of the population. While agriculture is the
mainstay of its economy, contributing some 60% of provincial gross domestic product and employing
around 67% of the labor force, farmers crop only some 1.5 million of Balochistan's 35 million ha. Of
this 1.5 million ha, farmers crop about 0.95 million ha (63%) using water harvesting/rainfall run-off or
flash flood diversion techniques. The remaining 0.55 million ha farmers crop using perennial irrigation
water.
4.           Balochistan's perennial water supplies come from either the Indus river system or from
small rivers or aquifers mainly in Balochistan's uplands. The Indus systems are usually large with
individual canal systems watering around 100,000 ha or more. In Balochistan, they are confined to the
Sibi plains in the province's east. The non-Indus systems or minor irrigation systems are quite different
and mainly consist of individuals pumping from tubewells or small schemes of 50400 ha supplied from
karezes (tunnel or underground channel tapping an aquifer) or from infiltration galleries or small weirs
in rivers. Minor irrigation systems, which supply nearly 50% of Balochistan's irrigated area, are
extremely important as they grow most of Balochistan's high value crops (orchards), and contribute
considerably to raising the province's farm incomes which are amongst the lowest in Pakistan. Minor
systems usually have informal water user groups who allocate water supplies and sometimes auction or
sell above average flows to members of the group.
5.           Issues. Social, technical, policy and institutional issues constrain the efficient, sustainable
and equitable development and use of Balochistan's minor irrigation resources. Poor scheme design and
construction are caused by the difficulties of organizing the tribal societies who inhabit Balochistan's rural
areas with their many disputes concerning water and land rights, no sources of long-term development
capital except for individual savings, weak Balochistan Irrigation Department (BID) technical services,
and weak construction contractors. Perennial water sources are small (around 2 to 4 cusecs) and
scattered, which mitigates against economies of scale in construction, infrastructure and supply of
services. Government of Balochistan (GOBal) has inappropriate capital cost recovery policies, that is,
it recovers none of the public expenditures on the capital costs of minor irrigation infrastructure, and until



-2-
the advent of the Balochistan Minor Irrigation and Agricultural Project (Cr. 1243-PAK) (BMIAD)
recovered little or none of expenditures on operation and maintenance (O&M). GOBal's past policies
concerning beneficiary involvement in the project have been outmoded. Government agencies planned,
implemented and operated minor irrigation systems in a "top-down" manner. While under BMIAD, BID
has brought beneficiaries into the screening, selection and planning of schemes, beneficiaries should be
more involved in the scheme planning and construction. Eventually BID should become a supplier of
technical services to farmer organizations (FOs), rather than a constructor of schemes.  GOBal
agricultural extension services are weak and this delays farmers changing to higher value crops to
maximize irrigated crop benefits.
6.            Objectives and Strategies.  Balochistan's primary agricultural sector development
objectives are to increase output growth and raise per capita incomes in an efficient and sustained manner,
with particular emphasis on enhancing productivity and improving natural resource management. To
meet these objectives, the Water and Power Development Authority of Pakistan (WAPDA), in association
with the Bank, has recently formulated a new long-term irrigation and drainage strategy for Pakistan.
(Pakistan Irrigation and Drainage: Issues and Options, March 25, 1994). The strategy is based on the
Bank Group's water resource management policy (Water Resources Management: A World Bank Policy
Paper, 1993), and promotes the use of market-determined incentives for improving the supply and
management of irrigation and drainage services. It would redefine the role of government and generally
commercialize and later privatize any water service that is not a public good. With regard to
Balochistan's minor irrigation, the Bank's new policy would emphasize: (a) redefining the roles of BID
and Balochistan's Agricultural Department (DOA) in developing minor irrigation; (b) developing further
nascent water markets; (c) establishing any required legislation and regulatory bodies to regulate, monitor
and advise on the sustainable use of available irrigation water resources; and (d) developing FOs capable
of constructing, controlling and operating sustainable minor irrigation systems.
7.            Project Objectives. The project's specific objectives are to: (a) redefine government's
role in minor irrigation development and provide assistance to facilitate change; (b) develop sustainable
FOs which, amongst other things, can efficiently operate and maintain minor irrigation systems; (c)
develop self-sustaining irrigation systems, and increase FO participation in their planning and
construction; (d) increase beneficiaries incomes and alleviate poverty; and (e) increase the recovery of
public expenditures on irrigation infrastructure from beneficiaries.
8.            Project Description. The project undertakes interrelated actions to greatly increase
community involvement in project development, financing and operation so as to increase beneficiaries'
ownership and commitment to project works, and lead to the efficient and sustainable use of resources.
These actions are in three broad areas, that is, developing and strengthening commnunities so they can
assist in planning and constructing minor irrigation systems and assume full responsibility for operating
them; constructing appropriate irrigation infrastructure which beneficiaries would be prepared to properly
operate and maintain; and changing and strengthening BID's capabilities so it can assist communities to
eventually take a leading role in developing their minor irrigation resources. The individual project
components are: (a) forming and developing FOs by providing technical assistance, data collection,
guidance, and training; (b) providing engineering, agricultural and other services to project beneficiaries;
(c) designing, constructing and/or rehabilitating some 30 minor irrigation schemes, a pilot program of
four flood irrigation schemes and, where needed, associated potable water supplies; (d) supporting a
Project Management Unit (PMU) within BID to implement the project by providing staff, technical
assistance, training, equipment, vehicles, office space and operating funds. The PMU would include a
community support group (CSG); (e) monitoring and evaluating project implementation through providing



- 3 -
staff, technical assistance, vehicles, equipment, office space and operating funds; (f) strengthening BID's
capabilities to interact with local communities and assist develop community planned and implemented
minor irrigation by providing technical assistance and training, including implementing some eight mini
irrigation schemes as part of in-service training; and (g) developing a pilot program to investigate how
BID might generally transfer O&M responsibilities to FOs of all minor irrigation schemes outside this
project or BMIAD.
9.           Major selection criteria the project would use when screening irrigation schemes include:
(a) no major unsolved disputes in the area; (b) top quartile of water right holders and land owners should
not control or own more than 70% of total water rights or 70% of total available land respectively;
(c) schemes must have a potential for increasing agricultural production; (d) minor perennial schemes
must have an assured minimum water supply of 1 ft3/sec (mini schemes can be less); (e) scheme
development must have a 10% or higher estimated economic rate of return (ERR); (f) beneficiaries must
establish a formal FO which would open local bank accounts, be involved in scheme design and
construction, and be responsible for scheme O&M; and (g) beneficiaries must contribute from 15 to 30%
of total scheme capital costs in real terms and 100% of O&M costs. The pilot program of flood irrigation
schemes would test the social, technical and economic feasibility of constructing permanent, simple, low
cost flash-flood diversion structures which would reduce system maintenance costs and improve diversion
efficiency. Community women will help plan and design the potable water supply systems, and the
project will give agricultural production training to women who are involved in agricultural operations.
The project would provide for two interim evaluations of project design and progress during
implementation, and resulting from these, staff would make the necessary program adjustments.
10.          Project Cost and Financing. GOBal would implement the project over seven years.
The IDA credit would assist finance the project over the first five years. GOBal with GON assistance
would finance all project costs (US$1.5 million equivalent) in years six and seven. For the first five
years the project has an estimated cost of US$38.5 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component
of US$11.9 million (31 %). IDA's proposed credit of SDR 18.5 million (US$26.7 million equivalent)
would finance 69% of project costs. The remaining project costs would be financed by GON (14%),
community households (7%) and GOBal (10%). Schedule A shows a breakdown of project costs and the
financing plan, while Schedule B shows amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, and the
disbursement schedule. Schedules C and D respectively give a timetable of key processing events, and
the status of Bank Group operations in Pakistan. The attached map shows the possible locations of the
irrigation schemes which the project would implement, while the Staff Appraisal Report, No. 13597-
PAK, dated August 28, 1995 is being circulated separately.
11.          Implementation. BID, through its PMU and in association with FOs and DOA, would
implement the project. PMU would screen schemes, and together with FOs, would plan and design the
irrigation schemes. PMU then would implement the main irrigation works, that is, headworks, main
canal and up to around 75 % of secondary canals, while FOs would implement command area
development (CAD) works, that is, works to deliver the water to the farm. Where possible, to give FOs
training in construction and contract work, PMU would contract with FOs to undertake simple parts of
the main works. PMU would also contract FOs to construct earthworks for the pilot flood irrigation
schemes. PMU's CSG, staffed by consultants and staff either directly hired or seconded from BID and
DOA, would assist communities establish and strengthen formal FOs, and would provide FO members
training and organizational, engineering and agricultural technical services, including amongst others,
training in project financing, construction design for CAD works, irrigation O&M instruction and
agricultural extension services. A non-governmental organization would train CSG's social organizers



- 4 -
and FO office bearers in group organization and management. DOA would second agricultural extension
staff to PMU's CSG. At project completion, BID would disband its PMU, and bring the responsibilities
for community irrigation development back into its regular work programs. To prepare for this, PMU
would assist BID's management formulate and implement a staff training strategy including management
and business plans. GOBal would establish a project steering committee to determine overall project
policy, assist with coordination and regularly review implementation.
12.           Project Sustainability. The project would screen communities and sites to ensure that
only those with a high probability of success were selected for development. A financial analysis of
project developments shows financial rates of return to farmers of 34 to 99% when, besides meeting
operating and land development costs, farmers contribute 15 or 30% of irrigation capital costs. These
rates of return should be attractive to farmers, and should ensure the sustainability of the development.
13.           Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement. GOBal is currently completing BMIAD
which IDA, Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) and GON have assisted to finance. Commenced in
1982, the project had considerable early difficulties including: (a) social constraints as the project paid
insufficient attention to the complex water and land rights pertaining to tribal areas; (b) remoteness of the
sites which were widely dispersed with often poor access; (c) weak contractors as tribal influence only
allows small, inexperienced local contractors to bid for work; and (d) poor organizational and
management arrangements. GOBal has overcome the most important of these constraints, social and
water right issues, through developing a comprehensive screening of schemes before accepting them for
construction. It also improved project organizational arrangements by establishing, amongst other things,
a PMU whose Director could procure goods and services up to Rs 20 million per contract, and a large
infusion of local and international technical assistance, providing both expert advise and additional staff
capability. Strict post qualification and selection procedures, along with rigorous monitoring, has
improved the performance of contractors.
14.           Other major lessons learned from experience with similar type projects in Pakistan and
elsewhere in the world include: (a) to ensure ownership of schemes all beneficiaries/stakeholder must be
involved in project planing and implementation; (b) with nominal outside inputs (concrete-makers, trolleys
and so on) local communities can construct simple engineering works at considerably less cost than local
contractors, and local contractors need to be screened and monitored; (c) irrigation works require an
adequate aftercare period to ensure they operate as expected; (d) NGOs can help local communities obtain
government services; and (e) project staff should continually monitor the progress of community/natural
resource projects, and periodically evaluate their results and impact, making any necessary program
adjustments.
15.           In keeping with these lessons of experience, the project is designed to: (a) carefully screen
all irrigation schemes according to social, economic and technical criteria; (b) involve beneficiaries in
scheme planning and implementation, and identify/organize/strengthen FOs from scheme screening
onwards (this includes assistance and training in organizational, agriculture and engineering matters);
(c) ensure that in schemes selected for the project FOs fully understand their obligations and agree to
contribute towards scheme capital costs and be fully responsible for operating and maintaining the
schemes; (d) consider and evaluate all technical options when designing schemes; (e) provide an
approximately two-year aftercare period following the construction of each scheme's main irrigation
works, plus initiating changes in BID so it can better serve minor irrigators; (f) undertake appropriate
qualification and monitoring procedures concerning contractors; (g) cluster schemes in about four general
locations; (h) ensure strong project management which adopts a multi-disciplinary approach to scheme



- 5 -
development; and (i) continually monitor project implementation progress, and periodically evaluate
results and impacts and make any necessary program adjustments.
16.          Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA's role is crucial to achieving the project
objectives, specifically to redefine the role of government, develop FOs capable of assisting to construct
and to operate the irrigation systems, and rationalize the use of public investment funds in irrigation
development. IDA is well placed to assist GOBal with policy issues that relate to water resources
development and management in Balochistan's environment with inland drainage basins. IDA has a
comparative advantage relative to other donors in these areas, and can also contribute considerably to
encouraging coordination between donors on key policy and institutional issues. The project would a]so
complement BMIAD.
17.          Country Assistance Strategy. The project is fully consistent with the country assistance
strategy discussed by the Board on March 31, 1994. The strategy focusses on two closely linked
development goals: poverty reduction and reducing constraints to sustained growth. To address the
poverty reduction objective the Bank Group's approach highlights improving inadequate basic social
services and so improving weak social indicators. To support the growth objective, which will help with
the income-related aspects of poverty reduction, Bank Group efforts concentrate on: structural reforms,
with an emphasis on public finance issues and improving the enabling environment for the private sector;
strengthening inadequate basic infrastructure; reducing constraints on agriculture productivity; and
protecting Pakistan's natural resources base. This project fits into the Bank Group's country assistance
strategy as it would implement the Bank's new irrigation strategy for Pakistan, allowing the private sector
to play a larger role in irrigation development and operation, thus improving productivity in these areas,
increase agricultural production and farm incomes, and improve the management and sustainability of
irrigation water resources. As project beneficiaries have a larger incidence of poverty than Pakistan
overall, by raising farm incomes the project will do much to alleviate poverty.
18.          Actions Agreed. At negotiations IDA and with GOBal agreed on the following: (a) by
December 31, 1995, PMU would recruit and place all its higher level (BPS-16 and above) seconded staff,
that is, from BID a Project Director (BPS-20), Assistant Project Director (BPS-19), Assistant Director
Finance (BPS-18), four Area Engineers (BPS-18), and four Junior Engineers (BPS-17), and from DOA
six Agricultural Officers (BPS-17); (b) PMU would (i) by January 31, 1996 furnish proposals for any
NGO-implemented training under the project to IDA for its prior review and approval; (ii) by April 30,
1996, under conditions acceptable to IDA, sign a memorandum of understanding with an appropriate
NGO to supply training services; and (iii) furnish proposals for other training under the project to IDA
for its prior review and approval; (c) PMU would locally recruit consultants to assist supervise project
implementation and prepare future projects; (d) PMU would, within six months of credit completion
prepare, under guidelines acceptable to IDA, a plan for future operation of the project, afford IDA the
opportunity to exchange views with GOBal on the plan, and implement the plan with due diligence and
efficiency, taking into account IDA's comments on implementation; (e) before proceeding to implement
any irrigation scheme, the Project Director and FO, in the presence of the Deputy Commissioner or other
appropriate official, would sign an agreement, which is acceptable to IDA, and which would describe
both parties' obligations and responsibilities under the project; (f) PMU, in consultation and agreement
with FOs, shall identify, plan and prepare project scheme proposals in a manner and in a form
satisfactory to IDA; (g) when an FO successfully completes its agreed contributions towards scheme
capital costs, BID would transfer to it full ownership rights over the improved headworks and distribution
system; and (h) BID and DOA, in accordance with terms of reference acceptable to IDA, and jointly with
IDA, would undertake two interim evaluations of the project, the first by September 30, 1997, and the



- 6 -
second by September 30, 1999, and would produce reports identifying any required changes in project
implementation with which project implementing staff would comply. The credit would not be effective
until: (a) PMU has signed a contract with an internationally recruited firm, or consortium of firms, with
qualifications and under conditions acceptable to IDA, to supply the main technical services, and the
consultants are on location ready to commence work; (b) the Executive Comrnmittee of the National
Economic Council has approved the projects Planning Commission's Form No. 1 and sanctioned project
expenditures; and (c) all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of GON's Grant Agreement have been
fulfilled, other than effectiveness of IDA's credit agreement.
19.          Poverty Category. The project falls within the program of targeted interventions.
Recent poverty data show that about 43 % of Balochistan's rural population fall near or below the poverty
line as compared to around 32% of Pakistan's total population. This degree of poverty or higher exists
in the project areas. Project beneficiaries would be small, remote communities, mainly located in
Balochistan's higher areas. Their average area of irrigated land per farm (0.5 ha) is considerably less
than the average (3-4 ha/farm) for other areas of Balochistan. Scheme selection criteria would ensure
that beneficiary communities have equitable distributions of water and land rights amongst their members.
By raising farm incomes and providing additional work opportunities in project area villages, the project
will help alleviate poverty.
20.          Environmental Aspects. IDA staff have classified the project as "B" regarding its
environmental impact. It would have a positive environmental impact through increasing water supply
and use, and would improve health and sanitation where it provides domestic water supplies. The works
would be small and would include adequate drainage, flood protection and soil erosion works. The
project would not lower groundwater levels, and where the project improves water diversion works, staff
would be careful to maintain traditional water rights between different groups or schemes. Agriculture
extension services would highlight the safe use of pesticides and other agricultural chemicals. While
malaria is endemic in Balochistan, project construction and operation would be tailored to minimize any
potential it might have for increasing malaria infections.
21.          Participatory Approach.  Communities wishing to upgrade their minor irrigation
resources under the project would apply to BID. Providing the proposed scheme met the project's
criteria, BID's PMU, in an iterative manner, would work with the community to plan and design the
scheme. Following agreement between the community and PMU concerning the scheme's design, BID
and the community would sign an agreement detailing each party's rights and responsibilities under the
project. Throughout the scheme selection and development process, the communities' FOs would play
a major role in their input to project planning, design and implementation. PMU would contract FOs
to undertake simple construction of the main works, while FOs would be responsible to constructing
command area development works (works to deliver water to individual farms). FOs would be 100%
responsible for operating and maintaining scheme works, and following repayment of their share of
capital costs, BID would transfer ownership of the newly constructed works to them. To ensure
communities have incentives to participate in the project, the project is designed to ensure: (a) equity
amongst beneficiaries in water right distributions; (b) beneficiaries have individual water rights and FOs
have control over water supply and distribution; and (c) attractive financial rates of return to farmers.
22.          Project Benefits. The project will do much to: (a) increase agricultural production and
incomes in areas containing a larger proportion of poor people than elsewhere in Pakistan; (b) strengthen
the communities' abilities to form sustainable local organizations and undertake and operate irrigation and
other development works; (c) improve village life through providing potable water, clothes washing and



- 7 -
animal drinking facilities; (d) help improve the status of rural women; and (e) strengthen BID's
capabilities to better administer and service community irrigation development. The project's quantified
economic analysis, however, only considers benefits resulting from incremental agricultural production.
The projects overall economic rate of return is an estimated 14%.
23.           Risks. Project implementation could be impaired by ineffective, unsustainable FOs, tribal
disputes, weak contractors and a too diffuse geographical spread of schemes. As well, beneficiaries may
not repay their share of scheme capital costs. To mitigate these risks the project would: (a) build F(Js
on traditional village organizations, institute linkages with traditional village leaders and involve them
with FO leadership, train FO office-bearers in organizational management and try to ensure FO members
have sufficient, appropriate incentives to join and stay in FO; (b) screen out schemes where potential
participants are involved in intractable disputes, but also provide transparent methods for dispute
resolving, based on traditional dispute solving mechanisms; (c) adhere to strict post-qualification review
and selection procedures of contractors, and rigorously monitor contract implementation; (d) to minimize
logistical difficulties, establish field offices so implementation staff are in reasonably close contact with
project operations, and when selecting schemes give preference to those close to each other thus
establishing clusters of schemes within the various areas; and (e) before undertaking construction of any
individual scheme, beneficiaries must sign an agreement which provides for repayment of a percentage
of infrastructure capital costs. Beneficiaries would pay around 50% of these capital costs up-front, that
is, during design and construction. Scheme construction would not be completed until all these funds
were collected. After scheme construction, FOs would collect the remaining balances and deposit them
into FO development accounts in local banks. Local communities would use these funds for high priority
local development expenditures. Finally, GOBal would not transfer ownership of any newly constructed
infrastructure to FOs until their members had fully contributed their share of the capital costs.
24.           Should the above project risks materialize, they are most likely to affect the project by
lengthening the construction period or increasing construction costs. If overall project construction was
lengthened by one or two years (that is, benefits lagged by one or two years), then the project's ERR
would fall to 13% or 11 % respectively. While the probability of a one year delay is quite high, say
around 40%, the probability of a two year delay is most likely closer to 20%, or less. With regard to
construction costs, potential increases are likely to fall within a range 10-15%, which would have little
effect on the project's ERR.
25.           Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
