REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Burundi for the equivalent of US$10.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance an Education Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The last economic report on Burundi (504a-BU) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on January 14, 1975. This was followed by an
economic memorandum (885a-BU) distributed on October 24, 1975. Country data
are provided in Annex I. Burundi is one of the 25 least developed countries
as defined by the United Nations.
3.        On November 1, 1976, the Army dismissed the regime that had been
in power since 1966 and suspended the Constitution. A new Government was
appointed, and it has stated that it will pursue policies of sound economic
management and national unity in respect of ethnic and regional differences.
Aid donors active in Burundi, including the Association, have been continuing
their activities without interruption.
4.        Burundi remains one of the poorest of the least developed countries,
with a per capita income estimated at US$100 in 1975. Over the past five
years GDP grew by no more than 2 percent annually in real terms. Of a popula-
tion of 3.7 million only 115,000 are in wage employment; the remainder depends
mainly on subsistence agriculture. The agricultural labor force is largely
untrained, and the level of enrollment in formal education is one of the
lowest in Africa.
5.        The economy is dominated by the agricultural sector.   Food crops
account for over half of GDP; other crops, of which coffee remains by far
the most important, account for a further 10 percent. In the 1974/75 coffee
season, production reached a record of about 28,000 tons, 35 percent higher
than the preceding year. The large harvest combined with a markedly higher
producer price resulted in a 62 percent increase in farmer incomes derived
from coffee with consequent multiplier effects in both industry and services.
Production in 1975/76 then fell sharply to 17,000 tons and adversely affected
rural incomes. The forecast for the current harvest indicates a strong re-
covery.
6.        Burundi has become increasingly dependent on coffee for foreign
exchange earnings; its share in total exports rose from 79 percent in 1965
to 87 percent in 1975. The marked increase in coffee prices during 1976 has
greatly strengthened Burundi's balance of payments. By October 1976, reserves

stood at a level equivalent to about six months of merchandise imports.
Rising import prices, combined with increased internal demand, caused a record
23 percent jump in the cost of living index for low income urban families
during the year ended March 1975, but since then price increases have been
moderate.
7.        The level of investment has remained consistently low, averaging
only 8 percent of GDP between 1970 and 1975. Domestic savings have amounted
to only 5 percent of GDP over the same period, approximately equal to net
capital inflows. Close to half of total gross capital formation was financed
by external aid.
8.        Due to high coffee prices, government revenues in 1974 were 14
percent above the level attained in 1973, while current expenditures grew
at only 9 percent. Thus, the Government's budgetary savings as a percentage
of total Government investment increased from 13 percent in 1973 to 28 percent
in 1974. In 1975, expenditures increased 10 percent whereas revenues remained
static, giving rise to a small current budget deficit.
9.        Burundi faces a formidable set of disavantages, including excessive
dependence on a single export (coffee) for foreign exchange, long and ineffi-
cient transport links for external trade, rudimentary infrastructure, and a
largely untrained labor force. In the past, civil strife has disrupted
development and diverted resources. There are, however, some encouraging
indications. Internal order has been restored and a new planning organisation
created. Improvements are being made in financial administration, and a
number of promising agricultural projects are under preparation. Substantial
nickel deposits have been found and may be brought into production over
the next ten years.
10.       At present, the Government lacks a coherent overall development
strategy. This is in part due to the low priority accorded to planning in
the past. As a first step in addressing this problem, the Government has
transferred responsibility for national planning to a new Ministry of Planning.
To make the new planning organization more effective, IDA is assisting in
strengthening its staff. A strong planning capability would enable the
Government to take the lead in initiating new projects and to coordinate
external aid within the context of a well defined development plan.
11.       The short term prospects for the economy are favorable, as coffee
prices are expected to remain at substantially higher levels than before
1976 owing mainly to frost damage to Brazil's coffee trees. In the longer
term, if the Government focuses on development and strengthens its administra-
tion, it may achieve steady, albeit slow, improvement in per capita incomes.
If nickel mining proves feasible the prospects over the next ten years would
be much better. However, although such a development appears technically
possible, the commercial viability of nickel mining has yet to be proved.
12.       Disbursements of official loans and grants have averaged US$16.7
million p.a. during 1974/75, the main contributions coming from Belgium,
the UN agencies, IDA and the European Development Fund. Technical assistance



- 3 -
has accounted for about half this aid. In the 1971/75 period, total net for-
eign capital inflows amounted to about US$70 million, of which US$57 million
were in official grants. On December 31, 1975, Burundi's external medium
and long-term debt amounted to about US$14.6 million excluding undisbursed
amounts. Of this the Bank and IDA together hold 30 percent. Debt service
averaged 4.0 percent of export earnings during 1972/75, with the Bank Group
receiving 26 percent of service payments. Due to the large grant element of
overall external assistance, by 1980, the Bank Group will probably continue
to hold a high proportion of Burundi's debt as well as be the recipient of
a large share of its debt service. Notwithstanding the low debt service
ratio, however, the country is not able to finance any borrowing on commer-
cial terms, in part because its absolute capacity to service external debt
is limited by the size and fluctuations of its export earnings due to its
dependence on coffee. External aid should finance a high proportion of
total project costs, including local expenditure, and it should be on grant
or near grant terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BURUNDI
13.       In 1957, the Bank lent US$4.8 million to the Belgian Trust Territory
of Rwanda-Urundi for the improvement of the Bujumbura-Muramvya road and
the expansion of the lake port of Bujumbura. The loan, guaranteed by Belgium,
was fully disbursed at independence in 1962 and is being repaid by Burundi
with Belgiam assistance. The last payment is due in 1977.
14.       Since independence, seven credits have been made to Burundi, totaling
US$20.7 million. The first credit for US$1.1 million, was made in March
1966 for the rehabilitation and extension of Bujumbura's water supply system.
A credit of US$1.8 million was made in April, 1969 for the improvement of
coffee production by smallholders, followed by a second credit of US$5.2
million approved in November 1975. This project is cofinanced by a $1.2
million loan from the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, while Belgium
assists in the carying out of a coffee research component (about US$600,000
equivalent). A credit of US$380,000, made in June 1970, helped finance the
detailed engineering of the Bujumbura-Nyanza Lac Road and a highway mainte-
nance study. This study led to a credit of US$5 million for a highway mainte-
nance project signed in March 1974. A Technical Assistance Credit of US$1.5
million was made in March 1976 to help strengthen planning, statistical
services and project preparation. A US$6.0 million credit for a Fisheries
Development Project, which was made in June 1976, should increase fish
production in Lake Tanganyika as well as the preparation of rural development
projects and the initiation of pilot development activities along the coastal
region of Burundi. The project is cofinanced by a $1.2 million loan from the
Abu Dhabi Fund for Arab Economic Development. No Bank loans have been made
since independence.
15.       Project execution is satisfactory.   Annex II contains a summary
statement of IDA credits as of November 30, 1976 and notes on the execution
of ongoing projects.



16.       The future lending program aims in particular at increasing agricul-
tural productivity to improve the nutrition and living standards of the
impoverished rural population. In September 1976, a mission visited Burundi
to discuss a possible rural development project including the establishment of
agricultural development centers in several parts of the country. The project
will be prepared by the Government of Burundi with assistance of our Resident
Mission in Eastern Africa. In addition, we plan to assist Burundi in promoting
and developing small-scale industry to help diversify its economy and increase
its potential to earn foreign exchange; to this end, we appraised a Development
Bank project in October 1976. We will also continue assistance for expanding
and improving the road network, a prerequisite for rural development and
expect to appraise a road project in February 1977. Finally, we will continue
our assistance to Burundi in improving planning, project preparation and
project implementation, and expect to provide funds for project management
and technical assistance in our lending operations.
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
17.       Formal education was introduced to Burundi early this century by
Christian missionaries who in 1925 were entrusted by the colonial administra-
tion with organizing primary education throughout the country. Institutions
of secondary education were established much later, and higher education
has been an achievement mainly of the days since Independence (1962). Although
the Government's standard curricula have been introduced at the primary and
secondary levels, missionary groups remain the legal owners of the majority
of educational institutions at these levels, and the Government has found it
difficult to introduce new curricula which give more emphasis to the social
and physical realities of Burundi.
18.       Until 1973, the recommended language of instruction throughout the
system was French, although the use of that language was never very successful
at the primary level because most primary teachers did not themselves have a
thorough knowledge of the language. The primary curriculum emphasized French
and mathematics and was principally a preparation for secondary school,
although only about 5% of primary-school leavers could hope to find a place in
secondary school. The primary curriculum thus succeeded only in alienating
the remaining 95% from their rural environment, although they could not expect
to find jobs except in agriculture. Similar problems existed at the secondary
and higher levels.
19.       The growth of education since Independence has been severely limited
by financial constraints. The Government itself allocates 22% of its total
recurrent budget to education, and over one half of the education budget is
for primary education; these percentages cannot realistically be increased a
great deal. For this reason, foreign assistance has been financing a large
part of the cost of education. In 1974, over half of the total recurrent
expenditures on education and training were contributed by bilateral and
multilateral aid agencies. Yet education has never reached a very large
percentage of the population. Even in the school year 1975-1976, enrollments
at the primary level were estimated to comprise only about 21% of the notional
age group; at the secondary and higher levels, they comprised only 2.5% and



- 5 -
0.5%, respectively. Burundi's education system thus suffers from serious
deficiencies in both qualitative and quantitative terms.
20.       To improve Burundi's education system, the Government began in 1969,
with UNESCO help, the elaboration of a major reform. In 1973, with UNICEF
financing and UNESCO technical assistance, a draft reform was presented and,
after minor changes, accepted by the Government for immediate implementation.
The reform's main elements are
(i) the "ruralization" of primary education, in view of the
fact that more than 90% of all primary-school leavers will
have to make a living in agriculture. The primary-school
curriculum is being given greater agricultural content and
orientation, to reflect better the social and physical
environment of Burundi. New importance is being given
to school gardens, and in the higher grades (5 and 6),
agricultural subjects will be complemented with elementary
skill training related to agriculture (e.g. tool repair-
ing, basket making, and rudimentary home economics);
(ii) the "Kirundization" of primary education, with Kirundi,
the national language, replacing French as the
official medium of instruction;
(iii) the gradual transformation of primary schools into com-
munity schools with facilities and opportunities for adult
education and civic activities;
(iv) the shortening of the primary course from seven to six
years and its gradual transformation into a self-contained,
terminal course;
(v) the reorganization and reorientation of secondary educa-
tion in order to make it more relevant to the needs and
realities of Burundi; and
(vi) the consolidation of the National University of Burundi in
order to avoid duplication and competition among the three
higher-level institutions formerly existing.
The central part of the reform is related to primary education, to which the
proposed project is directed.
21.       In educational terms, the reform to date has been successful.   Re-
sults have shown that children learn faster and more effectively when taught
in their native language; teaching is easier as well. The ruralization is
visible in the well-maintained school gardens which exist throughout the
country. These gardens have become important outdoor classrooms where rela-
tions between theory and the physical environment of the region can easily
be established. Curriculum development is well advanced, and several grades
have received their first supply of textbooks and other learning aids.
Teachers likewise have received the first edition of teaching aids.



- 6 -
22.       Yet, several critical constraints have become apparent which
threaten to hinder the continued progress of the reform. Given the present
low level of enrollments and the rapid growth of population, even if the
primary intake were increased by 5% per year, it would be possible to reach
an enrollment ratio of only about 60% by the end of this century. Financial
projections indicate that the Government would be able to absorb the growth
in recurrent costs related to such an expansion but that it would be dif-
ficult to find the resources to build the corresponding number of pupil
places with even the most austere standards. The Government is aware of these
limitations and is determined to hold down both capital and recurrent costs
as much as possible. In particular, in order to maximize the quantitative
impact of investment in education, the Government has agreed to (i) use local
construction materials to the extent possible and (ii) study the desirability
and feasibility of introducing two measures to increase the efficiency of the
primary educational process, namely automatic promotion and double-shifts.
Automatic promotion would reduce the drop-out and repeater rates and the
resulting wastage. Double-shifts, if possible, would maximize the use of
educational facilities and thereby reduce the burden of education expansion on
the capital budget. A thorough study of these measures is required because
their implementation would call, inter alia, for changes in curricula, teacher
training and administrative practices. In any case unless economic conditions
improve drastically, Burundi will have to be content with the level of educa-
tional development it can afford and must take a pragmatic stand vis-a-vis the
generally accepted higher UNESCO targets for educational development on the
African continent, which call for attaining universal primary education well
before the year 2000.
23.       In addition to the lack of primary places, facilities for the
teaching of the practical subjects foreseen by the reform do not yet exist.
Rural practical subjects will have to be taught in temporary facilities or
even in the open air when first introduced, but such precarious arrangements
are not feasible on a permanent basis, nor are they suitable for adult-educa-
tion activities. Likewise, primary-teacher training does not include training
in the teaching of rural practical subjects and in the organization of adult
classes and community activities, nor does a specialized facility for the
training of teachers in the teaching of practical subjects yet exist.
24.       The implementation of the primary reform and the supervision of
the primary system has been entrusted to the Rural Education Bureau (Bureau
d'Education Rurale), a semi-autonomous department within the Directorate for
Primary Education and Teacher Training of the Ministry of National Education.
Its main task is to reshape the primary curriculum and to prepare teachers for
the effective application of the new curriculum. In spite of a serious lack
of qualified personnel, curriculum development is progressing according to
plan, but limited printing and distribution capacity is hampering the timely
introduction of the reform throughout the country. In an attempt to make up
for delays, most learning aids are distributed prior to adequate testing in
pilot classes.
25.       Another complication stems from the existing pattern of primary-
school placement. Historically, primary schools have been opened first with-
in and subsequently near mission stations. This has led to an unbalanced
distribution which has not permitted equal access to primary schooling through-



-7-
out the country and has created a wide range in the quality of instruction.
As a rule, central schools (within missions) have better facilities, equip-
ment, and teachers than the branch schools which were set up through self-help
arrangements in more remote areas. Over time, these distributional short-
comings can be overcome through the proper location of additional schools.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
26.       The proposed project was identified by a Bank mission which visited
Burundi in July 1975 and prepared by the Government with the assistance of a
UNESCO team in November/December 1975. The project was appraised by a Bank
mission in February/March 1976. Negotiations were held in Washington from
November 29 through December 3, 1976. The delegation from Burundi was led by
Mr. Atale Ntahobari, Counselor to the Minister of National Education and
director-designate of the Project Unit which has been established for the
proposed project.
27.       The proposed project would assist the Government in continuing and
consolidating the reform of primary education as well as in increasing the
Government's control over the primary system. The project is designed to
address the problems outlined in paras. 22-23, so that its impact would be
both qualitative and quantitative. A Staff Project Report entitled "Education
Project in Burundi" (No. 1262-BU) dated January 21, 1977 is being circulated
separately. A Credit and Project Summary is provided as Annex III of this
report.
28.       The project would: (i) substantially expand the number of places in
primary education as well as improve equity in access to educational oppor-
tunities; (ii) provide important technical and material assistance to the
Rural Education Bureau as the main institutional force behind the reform;
(iii) assist in enlarging the production and distribution capacity of the
Rural Education Bureau's textbook-printing unit; and (iv) enable the Govern-
ment to undertake the training of teachers in practical subjects related to
agriculture. More specifically, the project would include:
(a) the construction and equipping of 100 multipurpose
learning centers (Centres de Formation Polyvalente);
(b) the expansion of the printing capacity of the Rural
Education Bureau's textbook-production unit; the provision
of equipment, vehicles, and 250 tons of paper for the
unit; and the provision of simple storage facilities
(lockers) for about 400 existing primary schools;
(c) the construction and equipping of facilities for the
training of teachers in the teaching of practical subjects;
(d) technical assistance, including (i) specialists' services
for the Rural Education Bureau (15 man-years); (ii)
specialists' services for project implementation (8



- 8 -
man-years); and (iii) fellowships for staff develop-
ment at the Rural Education Bureau (7.5 man-years); and
(e) operating expenses for project administration.
Detailed Features
29.       The 100 Multipurpose Learning Centers would provide 27,000 new pupil
places representing an increase of 21% over the primary capacity existing
in 1974-75. Additional Government investment in primary education as well as
self-help schemes organized by Burundi's political party, UPRONA (Unite et
Progres National - Unity and National Progress) and by the various missions
will continue to add further capacity at a more moderate rate. The new
Centers would be located in accordance with criteria which would favor those
areas which at present are least well provided in terms of educational oppor-
tunities (Section 3.06(a) of the draft Development Credit Agreement). The
choice of locations has already begun, according to a two-step process. Under
the first step, the Government and the Association have already agreed on the
allocation of 89 of the 100 Centers among 17 of Burundi's 18 districts (all
except Bujumbura, the district containing the capital). This allocation was
made on the basis of three different goals which the Centers are intended to
achieve, namely, to provide a demonstration effect, to reach the most popula-
ted areas, and to favor the educationally least well provided districts. The
remaining 11 Centers will be allocated within a year from the signing of the
Credit Agreement on the basis of the latest statistics and the need for
schools for agricultural or rural development projects. Under the second step
of the location process, the Centers allocated to each district will be
located in areas within that district which do not as yet have primary schools,
but which have school-age populations of sufficient size and density to fill a
primary school. The Government has already chosen 41 such locations in five
districts, and has agreed to select the remaining 59 locations by December 31,
1977 (Section 3.06(b) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
30.       The Centers would provide 4,500 places for the teaching of agricul-
tural and related rural practical skills, which now are taught in only a few
mission schools and without a satisfactorily systematic approach. The teach-
ing of practical subjects is intended to complement the ruralization of
primary education. These facilities, once established, would require only
limited capital outlays (sets of simple tools, cooking implements, etc.), and
recurrent expenditures (for wood, leather, etc.) could be kept to a minimum.
In order to assure an optimal utilization of these facilities, neighboring
schools would be invited to share them, and adult education programs would be
organized during free periods and school vacations.
31.       High teacher turnover at remote schools is a major cause of the poor
quality of teaching at many such schools. Since most of the new Centers would
be built in remote rural areas, the project would provide an average of two
staff houses per school in order to attract and retain qualified teachers and
to ensure the presence at the school at all times of at least one teacher to



- 9 -
serve as custodian of the facilities and at least one teacher to serve as
coordinator of adult education activities.
32.       The proposed project would provide vital assistance to the textbook-
production unit of the Rural Education Bureau. The annual requirements for
first-grade textbooks are, at present, on the order of 40,000 copies. Some
170,000 textbooks per annum are required for all primary grades, and teachers
now require about 2,200 teacher guides per annum. These quantities will
increase over the coming years; therefore, an additional offset press, other
equipment for the finishing of textbooks, and a modest expansion of the
printing unit's existing building are essential. An initial supply of 250
tons of paper would ensure the production of necessary textbooks for a five-
year period. In addition, about 400 of the least well equipped primary
schools (of the 570 existing schools) would receive simple but solid lockers
for storage of the new textbooks, teacher guides, and other teaching aids.
Six additional vehicles for the Rural Education Bureau would ensure the timely
and general distribution of all materials produced as well as regular super-
vision and in-service training of teachers. Since the present budget of the
Rural Education Bureau has no allocation for the operating costs of these new
vehicles, the Government has agreed that beginning in 1977 the Rural Education
Bureau's budget will be increased to reach at least FBu 15 million per annum
(Section 4.02(b) of the draft Development Credit Agreement), the minimum
necessary for its efficient operation.
33.       The center for the training of teachers in the teaching of practical
subjects within the Higher Teacher-Training School for Boys at Gitega would be
used in the beginning for the in-service training of teacher trainers and for
the training of a first group of teachers in the teaching of the new rural
practical subjects. Later, the center would be used for the retraining of all
teachers in the teaching of these subjects. Following curriculum changes in
the teacher-training course, it is expected that all teacher-training institu-
tions will provide preparation for the teaching of practical subjects, and the
Government has provided the Association with a program for such training.
34.       Burundi lacks the highly specialized manpower needed to implement
the reform. For this reason, the proposed project includes substantial
technical assistance to the Rural Education Bureau, including curriculum,
production, and evaluation specialists (15 man-years) needed to expedite the
implementation of the reform, and 7.5 man-years of fellowships for in-service
training of local staff of the Rural Education Bureau in African countries
where reforms similar to those in Burundi are being implemented. The project
would also include financial assistance to hire an accountant (5 man-years)
and a procurement specialist (3 man-years), both to be recruited interna-
tionally. The Government has agreed that all technical-assistance specialists
would be selected and appointed on the basis of terms and conditions satis-
factory to the Association (Section 3.05 of the draft Development Credit
Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing
35.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$11.7 million
equivalent, net of taxes and duties estimated at about US$0.8 million. The



- 10 -
foreign-exchange component is estimated at US$8.75 million equivalent, or 75%
of the total project cost net of taxes. The proposed Credit of US$10.0
million would meet 85% of the total project cost net of taxes and duties,
including $1.25 million equivalent of local cost. As explained in Part I,
local cost financing is justified by Burundi's poverty. Project costs and the
financial plan are summarized below:

The Government has provided satisfactory financial projections showing how it
will meet its share of the capital expenditures for the proposed project.
As to the capacity of the Government to provide the recurrent costs for the
proposed expansion of the sector promoted by the project, projections up to
1985 show that on the basis of an expected GDP growth rate of about 3.5
percent p.a. the recurrent cost of education would not exceed 25 percent of
the government's budget. This proportion is similar to that prevailing in
other African countries at the same level of development.
36.       Construction cost estimates are based on simple standards with maxi-
mum use of local materials. Space allocations in the Centers and the staff
houses would be the minimum acceptable for accomplishing the educati nal ob-
jectives. The unit construction cost for the Centers is about $80/m equiva-
lent, which compares favorably with the median value of unit casts for similar
schools in other Bank Group-financed projects which was $138/m equivalent in
1974-1975. Appropriate maintenance procedures for all buildings to be built
under the project would be developped (paragraph 3(i) of Schedule 4 to the draft
Development Credit Agreement).
Project Implementation
37.       The project should be implemented in about six years with a
proposed Closing Date of March 31, 1983. A Project Unit, which has been
established in the Ministry of National Education, would be responsible for
the implementation and financial and administrative control of the project



- 11 -
and for liaison with the Association (Section 3.02(a) of the draft Development
Credit Agreement). The Unit would comprise a director, an assistant director
(architect), a procurement officer, an accountant, and adequate supporting
staff, including two construction supervisors. The director and assistant
director have been nominated and must be formally appointed as a condition of
Credit effectiveness (Section 6.01(b) of the draft Development Credit Agree-
ment). The director is a senior official of the Ministry of National Educa-
tion; the assistant director (architect) will be provided and financed by the
Kingdom of Belgium under its bilateral assistance program to Burundi. The
Government has agreed that the procurement officer and accountant will be
appointed not later than June 30, 1977 (Section 3.02(b) of the draft Develop-
ment Credit Agreement). The director, assistant director, procurement officer,
and accountant would all be appointed on a full-time basis and on the basis of
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association (Sections 3.02, 3.04 and
3.05 and Schedule 4 to the draft Development Credit Agreement). Within three
months of the Closing Date of the project, the Project Unit would prepare and
send to the Association a report with a preliminary assessment of the project's
operational results and benefits, and of the lessons learned during implementa-
tion (Section 4.04 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Procurement
38.       It is unlikely that private building firms would be interested in
undertaking the construction of many of the Centers due to their small size
and dispersed locations. In those parts of the country where the mission
stations are equipped to undertake an additional construction program, the
most economic and efficient method of construction would be by negotiated
contract with these stations, which continue to construct the majority of
schools, churches, and dispensaries in the interior. The mission stations
would be supervised in this work by the Project Unit. Contracts acceptable
to the Association would be negotiated between the Government and the mis-
sions to build the Centers in those parts of the country where the missions
are willing and able to undertake construction. Small local construction
firms would build the remaining Centers as well as the teacher-training
facilities and the extension to the textbook-printing unit.
39.       Contracts would be awarded as follows:   (i) The 100 Centers (US$5.6
million equivalent) would be constructed either on the basis of negotiated
contracts between the Government and parties acceptable to the Association, or
on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with
local procedures satisfactory to the Association; (ii) contracts for the
extensions to the Teacher-Training School (US$75,000 equivalent) and to the
textbook-production unit (US$65,000 equivalent), as well as contracts for
furniture, equipment, and vehicles costing less than US$50,000 equivalent
each would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally
and in accordance with local procedures satisfactory to the Association; and
(iii) contracts for furniture, equipment and vehicles costing more than
US$50,000 equivalent each would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's guidelines for
procurement.



- 12 -
40.       Standardized sketch designs, draft tender documents, and master
lists of furniture, equipment, vehicles, and paper, indicating proposed
grouping for tender, would be reviewed by the Association. Items would be
grouped to the extent practicable to encourage competitive bidding and to
permit bulk procurement. Review of tender evaluation documents by the Asso-
ciation prior to award would be required only for contracts above US$50,000
equivalent for equipment, furniture, vehicles, and paper. Domestic manufac-
turers of furniture and equipment would be allowed a preference of 15% or the
existing rate of import duties, whichever is lower, over the c.i.f. price of
competing foreign suppliers.
Disbursements
41.       Disbursements would be on the basis of (a) 85% of total expenditures
for civil works; (b) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported construction
materials, furniture, instructional equipment, printing equipment, paper,
and vehicles; or 85% of local expenditures, if procured locally; (c) 100% of
foreign expenditures and 80% of local expenditures for technical assistance;
and (d) 75% of total expenditures for salaries and operating costs of the
Project Unit. All disbursements would be fully documented except those for
project administration. Disbursements for project administration would be
made against a certificate of expenditure, documentation of which would not
be submitted for review but would be retained by the Borrower and would be
available for inspection by the Association in the course of project supervi-
sion. Auditing would be required on an annual basis for expenditures incurred
by the Project Unit for project administration. Any funds remaining upon
completion of the project would be used for project-related items subject to
agreement between the Government and the Association. Retroactive financing
in an amount not exceeding US$200,000 equivalent is recommended for expendi-
tures incurred by the Project Unit after August 1, 1976, for project preparation.
42.       A revolving fund would be established within the Project Unit, with
an initial contribution of US$100,000 equivalent from the Government, from
which the Project Unit will procure those materials, services, and mobilization
advances which would not be disbursed by the Association directly. The
Government would seek reimbursement from the Association for expenditures
incurred, following normal procedures, with the Government maintaining the
fund at about US$100,000 equivalent throughout the project implementation
period. The establishment of the revolving fund is a condition of effectiveness
of the Credit Agreement (Sections 3.03 and 6.01(a) of the draft Development
Credit Agreement).
Benefits and Risks
43.       Productivity at the level of individual small-holdings should
increase significantly if a larger proportion of Burundi's population achieves
basic literacy and numeracy and learns improved agricultural techniques. In
recognition of this fact, the Government has introduced an education reform of
major proportions. The proposed project would provide critical material and
technical assistance to this reform, thus helping to improve the quality of
primary education and increasing its relevance to the country's development
needs, as well as providing a substantial quantitative increase in the number
of primary places and helping to augment the Government's control over the



- 13 -
sector. In addition, the proposed project would aid institution building
within the Ministry of National Education in the areas of curriculum develop-
ment, teacher upgrading, evaluation, textbook production and school design.
All primary-school children in the country would benefit from the project
through the provision of textbooks; moreover, as a result of the proposed
project's siting procedures, the expansion of the capacity of primary education
by about 20% would benefit particularly the educationally least favored of
Burundi's children, namely, those who live in rural areas where per capita
incomes are estimated to be only about US$40 equivalent.
44.       The principal risks are those of implementation.   Arrangements made
to reduce these risks include (a) a tight supervision schedule; (b) a conser-
vative six-year implementation period; (c) the use of the already existing
apparatus of the missionaries for a large part of the construction in the
rural areas; and (d) technical assistance. Another risk is whether or not
the Rural Education Bureau will be able effectively to continue its work in
the expansion and generalization of the reform of primary education; should
the Rural Education Bureau not be able to carry out its functions, the effect
of the Centers would be merely quantitative (limited to the provision of
primary-school places). The substantial material and technical assistance
to the Rural Education Bureau is designed to minimize this risk.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
45.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Burundi and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Associa-
tion, and the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed Development
Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
46.       Features of the draft Agreement of special interest are referred
to in paragraphs 22, 29, 32, 34, 36, 37 and 42 and are listed in Section III
of Annex IV of this report. Special conditions of effectiveness of the draft
Development Credit Agreement (Section 6.01), are (i) the establishment of a
US$100,000 equivalent revolving fund for the Project Unit and (ii) the formal
appointment of the Project Unit's director and assistant director.
47.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOMMENDATIONS
48.       I recommend that the Executive Directors of the Association
approve the proposed credit.
