AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises an Agricultural Credit Project for which
an IDA credit of $10.5 million is proposed. It will support a three-year
lending program for financing investments on about 12,000 farms under four
major categories: orchards, sericulture, mushroom, and poultry and swine.
Agriculture in Korea, which in 1968-70 contributed 28% of GNP and 26% of
exports and employed nearly half of the labor force, has been increasing at
a fair rate of slightly less than 4% per annum, but lagging significantly
1-fhind the remarkable growth (10%) of the economy. The country's Third
Plan (1972-76), therefore, seeks to raise agricultural output at the rate of
4.5% and achieve a more balanced growth between agriculture and other economic
sectors. The proposed Project would assist in meeting these goals by generat-
ing about 6,000 jobs and by raising the income of participating farmers.
Increasing production of fruit, pork, poultry meat, and eggs would meet the
needs of urban consumers while support to mushroom and sericulture would help
expand exports. The agricultural program, previously dominated by rice,
would thus be better balanced.
ii.       Korean farmers are skilled, industrious, receptive to new tech-
nology, market-responsive and eager to invest. They have experience in the
technical requirements of the activities to be financed under the Project
and, as members of the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF),
they benefit from its input supply, credit and marketing services, and Govern-
ment's extension service. These support services would improve under the
Project with the help of experts to assist the proposed technical unit and to
train loan officers.
iii.      This would be the first agricultural credit project to be financed
in Korea by the Bank Group. Three previous operations in the agricultural
sector involved two irrigation projects and a dairy-beef project.
'v.       The IDA credit would finance US$10.5 million, or 58% of total
project cost, including $7.4 million of local cost. The estimated Project
i_3t is US$18.2 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
*'"T3.1 million.  Labor and local materials constitute a large proportion
of the investment cost. Government/NACF would contribute US$4.2 million
equivalent, or 23% of Project cost, while the balance of about 19% would
come from resources of the sub-borrowers. Of the Project cost, 38% would
be for orchards, 32% for sericulture, 11% for mushroom, and 15% for poultry
and swine. The balance of 4% would be for training facilities and technical
services. The period of loan to sub-borrowers would vary from five years in
the case of poultry and swine to 12 years for apples. Government's contribu-
tion to Project cost, together with the proceeds of the IDA credit, would be
transferred to NACF as a loan for not less than 15 years, carrying interest
at 7% and set up as a special fund in the NACF. Government would decide, in
consultation with IDA, whether the resources of this special fund would be
retained as a long-term loan or provided to NACF in any other form after the



- ii -
proposed study of NACF by management consultants. NACF would pass on the
funis at 9% to the Kun (county) cooperatives, which, in turn, would charge
122 on the loans to the farmers.
v.        The NACF is the apex organization of agricultural cooperatives
in Korea at the national level. It would finance sub-borrowers through
selected Kun cooperatives that are its members and operate at the county
level. The working of NACF is complicated by the fact that it helps
implement Government policies by undertaking supply, marketing, and other
functions in addition to credit. Some of these activities are subsidized.
Though deposit mobilization by cooperatives has been significant, the capital
base of NACF is weak in relation to its expanding operations, and its profits
have been meager. Under the Project, its financial position would be
strengthened by the provision of Government funds in the form of a long-term
loant, and its efficiency in regard to loan appraisal and supervision would
be improved through technical assistance. Its organization and accounting
system would also be studied by management consultants as a preliminary
step to reorganization and improvement of cost accounting and management
information.
vi.       The range of items to be financed under the Project for on-farm
inve,stment is varied and would not be suitable for international competitive
bidding. Farmers would purchase supplies and implements of their own choice
through existing cooperative or private commercial channels. The construction
of buildings costing US$75,000 (mostly for NACF's training facilities), would
be subject to local competitive bidding. Power tillers, though part of the
Project, would not be financed by IDA credit.
vii.      Estimated financial rates of return range from 18% to 58% for
the various sub-projects. The estimated overall economic rate of return is
about 37%. The Project would be suitable for an IDA credit of US$10.5
million on IDA's usual terms.



KOREA
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Republic of Korea's request for an IDA credit is the result of
efforts by Government, with Bank Group assistance, to develop an agricultural
credit project suitable for Bank Group financing. Two FAO/IBRD Cooperative
71rogran, missions, one in February/March 1969 and another in May/June 1970,
and an IBRD mission in March 1971, visited Korea to assist the National
'Qicultural Cooperative Federation (NACF) in preparing its application.  The
Project is designed to help diversify Korean agriculture and to strengthen
cooperative credit and other farmer services.
1.02      The Bank Group has made three loan/credits to Korea for agricultural
development: US$45 million (Loan 600-KO) in 1969 for the Pyongtack - Kumgang
irrigation project; US$7 million (Credit 234-KO) in 1971 for an integrated
dairy-beef project; and US$15 million (Credit 283-KO) and US$33 million
(Loan 795-KO) in 1972 for the Yong San Gang Irrigation Project.
1.03      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission to
Korea in June/July 1971, consisting of Messrs. von Oppenfeld, Merghoub,
Ramasubbu and Rossi (IDA).
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      The Republic of Korea comprises 98,000 km , covering the southern
half of a peninsula located between the East Sea and the Yellow Sea (Map 1).
It has a population of 31.8 million and had an average annual growth rate-of-
2.3% over the period 1965-70, down from 2.9% in the early 1960's.  The rural
p.pulation that derives its livelihoood from agriculture was less than 50%
,D total population in 1970.  Korea has had an effective land reform.  Maximum
farm size is 3 ha, except for orchards, pasture, and range land.  However,
fragmentation is a problem from the standpoint of modernization efforts.
2.02      Annual growth in GNP has averaged 9.6%, (1960-69) in real
terms, but has not been equally distributed, expansion in manufacturing being
substantially in excess of this figure, while agricultural growth averaged
slightly below 4%. Agriculture, fisheries, and forestry accounted for about
28% of GNP and contributed an average of 26% of total merchandise exports
in 1970. Real income per farm household increased by 45% in the 1965-69
period, while real farm wages rose 50% between 1965 and 1970. Per capita
income was about US$225 equivalent in 1970. Prices have been rising at an
annual rate of 8% to 10% in recent years.



-2-
2.03      To achieve stability in the balance of payments and domestic prices,
sa,me slow-down in the rate of economic expansion would be required. Moreover,
considerable efforts are needed to promote exports and import substitution,
both in industry and agriculture. A major economic problem is the mobilization
of sufficient resources. Agricultural imports increased more sharply than
agricultural exports, exceeding exports by US$220 million in 1970 (Annex 1,
Table 2). The Third Plan projects that agricultural output will rise at the
rate of 4.5% and that exports will increase sharply. Production of rice, the
most important staple crop, is to go up by about 1 million m tons, or 25%,
in line with Korea's aim of achieving self-sufficiency in rice.
B. Agricultural Sector
2.104     About one-fourth of Korea's total land area is cultivated (2.5 mil-
lion ha). Average farm size is about 0.9 ha. Irrigation (about 1 million
ha) and mild winters in the country's southern part permit an increased land
use intensity through double-cropping (about 3.6 million ha is cropped).
Most of the intensively farmed land is alluvial and lies along the river
basins, valleys and coastal margins, although piedmonts and high uplands
have good development potential. Annual rainfall ranges from 800 to 1,600
mm. Further details on physical resources and development potential are in
Annex 1.
2.05      Rice is the major crop, occupying about 1.2 million ha.  Output
grew at slightly less than 2% during the 1960's, averaging about 4 million
mi tons in 1968 and 1970. Barley follows rice in impori:ance and its
output is around 2 million m tons. Minor staple crops are wheat and soybean.
Output of fruits, vegetables and livestock products expanded significantly
during the 1960's due to increasing consumer demand in domestic urban mar-
kets, while production of silk and mushroom grew in response to rising
export demand. Although some 40% of Korean farmers keep cattle, 39% hogs
and 47% poultry, the numbers per farm are small, running, on average, no
more than one cow or pig per household and less than 10 chickens. As the
orientation of these livestock industries is shifting from home consumption
to commercial markets these numbers will gradually increase.
2.06      A comprehensive policy towards agriculture has slowly emerged.  Its
principal aim has been to increase food grain production, especially rice and,
equally important but on a smaller scale, industrial crops like mushroom,
mulberry for sericulture, and tobacco. Dairy-beef cattle (Credit 234-KO) and
otlher livestock development has been encouraged to attain a more balanced
syistem of mixed farming (para 2.14).
2.07      To achieve these goals, Government has developed irrigation (about
100,000 lha since 1965), made fertilizer and lime available at subsidized cost
(consumption increased from 279,000 m tons in 1960 to 563,000 m tons in
1970), established a nationwide extension system, and expanded credit
services (loans outstanding rose from W 24,000 million in 1966 to W 105,000
million in 1970). For satisfactory provision of extension, credit and farm



supplies, Government has taken steps to strengthen the countrywide network
of agricultural cooperatives under the National Agricultural Cooperative
Federation (para 2.15, Annexes 2 and 3, and Map 2).
2.08      Although the agricultural growth rate (slightly less than 4%)
did not match the remarkable industrial growth (20% during the 1960's), it
was substantially in excess of population increase (para 2.01). However,
rising income and consumption have led to a trade deficit in agricultural
products. Major goals of the Third Plan are to expand agricultural production
and raise rural living levels. To help achieve them, Government has allocated
a total. of W 470 billion, one-quarter of total public expenditure, for
inrvestment in agriculture, fisheries, ard forestry. Efforts initiated under
aie Second Plan are to be intensified and supplemented by seed improvement
-nd farm mechanization. Implementation of the ambitious development program
will require considerable efforts and resources on the part of Government.
2.09      A second objective of the new Plan is to continue crop diversifi-
cation to expand agricultural exports (especially silk and mushroom) and
increase production of nutritionally superior foods (fruit and livestock
pi:'ducts) to satisfy the rapidly increasing domestic demand. The Plan aims
at high rates of annual growth--corn, 14%; pork, 11%; eggs, 8%; and cocoon,
14%. The proposed Project would encourage poultry, swine and fruit production
to satisfy domestic demand and would improve cocoon and mushroom production
to help achieve export targets.
2.10      Korean farmers are literate, industrious and improvement-minded
and can be expected to respond to appropriate incentives and to provide, in
the long run, the leadership required for a vigorous rural cooperative system.
The adequacy of support services and effectiveness of production incentives,
on the other hand, depend to a large extent on the institutional strength
of NACF. Over recent years, the scope and scale of NACF's responsibilities
have grown substantially as it expanded its activities in credit, input
distribution and marketing. Under the Third Plan, these activities will
grow even more, which means that NACF will have to increase and improve
its organization if it is to play an effective role. A study of NACF by
vsanageMent consultants is, therefore, proposed under the Project, as a first
step towards enabling NACF to reorganize and improve its services (para 4.21).
'-hards
_.11      Fruit orchards (mainly apples, grapes, peaches, and pears) accounted
for about 2% of Korea's cultivated area in 1969, generating an output of
about 420,000 m tons (Annex 8). Production, in fresh or processed form, is
mainly for the domestic market, with export to neighboring countries not
yet significant. Domestic consumption of such commodities is increasing and
prices have been rising more rapidly than those of other farm products,
reflecting the rapid growth of the urban population coupled with rising per
capita incone (Annex 8, Table 1).  Orchard areas have increased by 30% during
the last five years, indicating spontaneous growth, and, although about
40% are estimated to be still non-bearing, output has grown by 34%.



-4-
Sericulture
2.12      Traditionally a household industry, sericulture is emerging as an
export-oriented commercial farm enterprise. On a small scale, silkworms are
reared in farm houses but this is unsatisfactory, partly because of poor
sanitation and quality control and partly because of insufficient space.
Abcout 500,000 families, or 19% of rural households, are engaged in the
inclustry. Area in mulberry trees and raw silk exports have increased four
tinies from 1962 levels. Further significant increases will require new
specialized farm structures for silkworm rearing. Further details are in
Annex 9.
Mushroom
2.13      The growth of Korean mushroom production and exports masks many
failures of small, independent mushroom farms. Experi6nce has shown that
production units must be large enough to afford the level of management
and capital input needed to enable them to control the environmental factors
(properly composted soil, fertility, humidity, and phyto-sanitary conditions)
necessary for mushroom growing. The increase in annual production from 100
m tons in 1965 to 6,000 m tons in 1970 has mainly come from such commercial
units. To ensure regular and increasing supplies, mushroom canners have
themselves invested in mushroom growing facilities, either alone or in joint
ven,tures. Further details are at Annex 10.
Poultry and Swine
2.14      The demand for high protein food in Korea's urban markets is strong
and rapidly expanding (Annex 11, Table 1). Government, with IDA (Credit
234-KO) and bilateral assistance, is promoting dairy and beef development
but incremental production is subject to long gestation periods. Poultry
and pork production, however, can be increased in a relatively short time.
Chicken population and egg production, in fact, more than doubled between
1965 and 1970, mainly because of the strong market and the availability of
appropriate technology. Swine production has not yet increased significantly
although many farmers are engaged in it on a small scale. Though feed
ingredients, especially maize, are imported, the domestic feed industry is
growing. Technicians and salesmen of Korean hatcheries and feed mills, some
trained with parent companies abroad, play an important role in disseminating
technical and managerial information to poultry and swine producers.
C. Agricultural Services
Organizational Support
2.15      The agricultural cooperative structure of Korea consists of the
NACF at the national level, 140 cooperatives at the county level (Kun
cooperatives), and 6,714 cooperatives at the village level (Ri Dong cooperatives).
This network, which covers, through its membership, about 93% of the estimated
2.6 million farm households in Korea and is multipurpose in its functions, is



the major instrument through which the Government implements its agricultural
policies. Government and NACF have been octively implementing a progran to
reorganize the village cooperatives to form viable units. As a result, theti
number has dropped from about 16,000 in 1968 to 6,714 in 1970, and is expected
to go down to 1,500 by the end of 1972. Through this system, NACF distributes
farm inputs; markets agriculturl produce; conducts training for employees
and leaders of the cooperatives; and operates a guidance (extension) service,
especially for cooperative management.
2.16      The main Government and semi-Government agencies supporting
agriculture (besides NACF) are: the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries (MAF), the Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC), and the
Agriculture and Fisheries Development Corporation (AFDC).
2.17      The MAF formulates agricultural policy and its Office of Rural
Development (ORD) conducts research and advises farmers through a
nationwide extension service. ORD is especially active in a seed-improvement
program and maintains and itproves quality standards of agricultural
commodities.
2.18      The ADC, a semi-autonopious agency with ultimate responsibility to
the Minister of Agriculture, directs water resource development, land
consolidation and reclamation, and agricultural mechanization. The AFDC, a
Government-owned financial corporation, encourages processing and marketing
of agriculture, forest, and fish products by providing equity and loan
capital.
Agricultural Credit
2.19      The banking system of Korea consists of six commercial banks, which
operate branches throughout the country; seven local banks with smaller
jurisdictions; branches of six foreign banks; and seven specialized banks,
the NACF being the most significant in relation to agricultural credit. The
Bank of Korea, as the central bank, exercises powers of credit control and
supervision and provides rediscount facilities. The only non-bank financial
institution relevant to agriculture is the AFDC (para 2.18).
2.20      Of 1,432 bank branches in Korea, 751 belong to NACF and other
cooperatives which are the major institutional source for agricultural credit
(Annex 2). Non-institutional lending, however, is more important: according
to a farm household survey, 68% of the average borrowings per cultivator
household at the end of 1969 was supplied by individuals (other farmers,
relatives and friends), 21% by cooperatives and other public bodies, and
11% by others, including commercial banks.
2.21      Interest rates charged by private moneylenders have been excessive,
reportedly going up to 50 to 60% per annum in some instances, despite some
decline under the impact of expanding cooperative credit. In the institu-
tional sector itself, interest rates on deposits (10 to 21%) and loans
(22 to 24%) have generally been maintained at relatively high levels since
1965 as part of a monetary policy designed to check inflation (para 2.02)



-6-
and promote savings. Lower lending rates were permitted, however, for
priority sectors such as exports (6%) and agriculture (9 to 15%), supported
by low cost funds from Government and the Central Bank.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Definition
3.01      The Project, which would be part of NACF's lending program, would
help finance, over three years, medium- and long-term investments on farms
typically ranging from 1 to 3 ha. Investments would be for a mix of farm
enterprises under four categories: orchards (38%); sericulture (32%); mush-
room (11%); and poultry and swine (15%). The balance (4%) of Project cost
would be for technical services and training facilities. Project loans would
usefully complement and supplement on-going Government programs for irrigation,
drainage and watershed development, land improvement and consolidation and
irncreased availability of high-grade inputs, especially seeds and planting
mnterials. They would also enable participating farmers to adopt modern
technology.
3.02      Illustrative farm size, phasing of loans, average investment per
farm, and total investment cost for each sub-project are shown below:

3.03      NACF would administer the Project, which would involve about
12,000 participating farmers.  Sub-loans would be made by NACF on the
basis of farm development plans, prepared by the farmer assisted by Kun
(county) cooperative loan officers. These officers would also appraise loan
requests and supervise their implementation.
B. Detailed Features
Orchards
3.04      The Project would finance development expenditures for apple,
grape, peach (including other stone fruit) and pear orchards. Detailed
estimates of investment and operating costs are set out under four
illustrative farm models (Appendixes 8-1 to 8-4). Malor investment
categories would be for land clearing, terracing and preparation; orchard
establishment, including improved planting materials, fertilizer and hired
labor; power sprayers and tillers; water supply; and on-farm storage or
handling facilities. Small equipment and storage facilities would normally
be acquired by individual farmers. Where appropriate, NACF intends to
encourage full use of modern equipment and facilities through loans to
associations of farmers.
3.05      Although sub-loans would be made to about 2,500 fruit farmers in
seven out of nine provinces, there would be a marked concentration within
the fruit growing counties of these provinces, involving only 14 out of NACF's
140 Kun cooperatives (para. 2.15). This would facilitate effective orchard
loan appraisal and supervision through specially trained loan officers of
selected Kun cooperatives. This concentration would also be advantageous
for fruit marketing since, in addition to being members of Kun cooperatives,
farmers are active in specialized horticultural ccoperatives that organize
auction sales and bulk shipments to terminal markets and, in certain cases,
operate storage and processing facilities.
Sericulture
3.06      Sub-loans under the sericulture component would help increase the
productivity (through improved planting materials and new hybrid silkworms)
and replant and expand the mulberry plantations from the present average size
of less than 0.2 lha to about 0.4 ha. Replanting is important because the
yield of mulberry leaf (the silkworm's feed) declines sharply when bushes
arc older than 14 years (Annex 9) and there are many old plantations.
Sub-loans would also cover expenditures for silkworm rearing houses,
including ancillary facilities and implements (Appendix 9-1). Specially
designed, tlhouglh inexpensive, rearing houses would permit environmental
control, wlhich determines quantity and quality of output (cocoons).
Investments would be concentrated in regions covered by 25 of NACF's Kun
cooperatives, involving about 9,000 farmers. Because detailed appraisal of



- 8 -
each sub-loan, based on a visit to each farm, would not be possible, sub-
borrowers would be selected by the Kun cooperative's loan appraiser in close
cooperation with the local extension officer and the processing (silk
reeling) plant.
Mushroom
3.07      High mushroom yields in Korea cannot be obtained witlhout modern
inputs, buildings, and equipment. Major investment categories for this
component (detailed in model 3, Appendix 10-1) are buildings, growing beds
and associated facilities, heating and water systems, and small equipment.
The mushroom houses would be located close to existing canning plants.
The typical sub-borrower would either be a mushroom canner or one or more
owners of several sub-units in joint venture with a mushroom canner.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that, unless otherwise agreed
with IDA, sub-loans (except those for units wholly owned by canners) would
require at least 20% participation by the canner in the investment for
growing facilities and a management contract, satisfactory to NACF, between
the grower(s) and the canner. These measures would enable NACF to encourage
growers to participate in ownership and management by providing for financing
of several sub-units within composite mushroom houses and ensure proper
management of mushroom raising (para 2.13).
Poultry and Swine
3.08      The Project would encourage investments for poultry and swine under
three sub-projects: (a) broiler; (b) egg; and (c) pork production. Major
investment categories, as detailed in three farm models (Appendixes 11-1 to
11-3), would be buildings, tools and implements and feeding and watering
facilities. Typical new production units for laying hens would have a
capacity of 2,000, while those for broilers would be able to house 4,000
(a turnover of three to four times a year is planned). Brooder houses would
also be built for rearing chicks. Existing facilities for pork production
would be expanded to increase capacity from 15 weaner pigs to 50. Sub-loans
would be concentrated in 19 of NACF's 140 Kun cooperatives, in the vicinity
af the important urban markets (Map 2). About 750 farmers would be involved
as sub-borrowers.
Teclnical Services
3.09      The Project would provide for the services of a senior farm manage-
uLent expert to advise NACF on appraisal and supervision of loans, orga-
tize and conduct training courses for the loan officers of NACF and Kun
cooperatives, and follow up these efforts in the field. His services would
be required for at least two years. Additionally, provision has been made
for a mushroom consultant to be employed for about three months to assist NACF
staff in technical aspects of building design and other operating matters.
A study of NACF's accounting system and organization by a firm of management
consultants is also provided for.
Training Facilities
5.10      The credit would help improve and expand NACF training facilities
and technical services (para 4.15) required for Project operations and related



- 9 -
essential services. Works would consist of expanded accommodation and
library facilities for the trainees, including appropriate equipment. NACF
has detailed plans and cost estimates to cover these improvements.
C. Cost Estimates and Financing
Cost Estimates
3.11      Total Project cost is estimated at W 6.7 billion (US$18.2 million),
of which 17%, or W 1.1 billion, would be foreign exchange. Locally provided
materials and labor account for 83% of Project costs. Estimates are based
on constant prices as of July 1971 and include an allowance of about 15% for
price increases. Cost estimates, including foreign exchange requirements, are:

Financing
3.12      The IDA credit would finance US$10.5 million, or about 58% of total
Project cost (US$18.2 million). This would include US$7.4 million equivalent
of local cost financing. Government/NACF would contribute US$4.2 million
equivalent, or 23% of Project cost.  The remaining US$3.5 million equivalent
would come from the sub-borrowers' own resources and would cover about 20%
of their investment cost. Financing of various Project components would be

3.13      Government would be the borrower, obtain the credit on IDA terms,
and carry the exchange risk. It would transfer the proceeds of the IDA
credit to NACF in the form of a loan, bearing interest at 7% and a maturity
of no less than 15 years, which would be set up as a special fund (para 4.09).
D. Procurement and Disbursement
Procurement
3.14      The range of items financed is varied and would not be suitable
for international competitive bidding. Buildings represent the most
important investment category. Investments per farm would range from US$140
on peach farms to about US$73,000 equivalent for mushroom growing houses.
On-farm storage, silkworm rearing sheds, poultry and swine houses would be
constructed by the farmers themselves or by local artisans. On the other
hand, all buildings costing more than US$75,000 each (mostly library and
training facilities) would be procured through local competitive bidding.
These buildings would not be of interest to foreign firms because of the
different types involved and their scattered location. Miscellaneous small
implements, tools and fittings for buildings represent the second largest
category. Typical items would include sprayers, dusters and pumps for
orchards, silk worm incubators, rearing shelves, nets and boxes for
sericulture, feeders and waterers for swine and poultry farms. This
variety of items would be procured in small amounts through normal
cooperative and commercial channels which are well developed and readily
accessible. The supply of these items is adequate. Power tillers which



- 12 -
represent only 6% of the Project cost are produced by three domestic firms.
Imports being restricted, farmers' choice is limited to these makes and
models and parts not locally produced are subject to an import duty and tax
together amounting to 100%. As IDA requirements of free competition are not
melt, such purchases are not eligible for financing under the credit. As in
the past, the power tillers in the project will be financed by Government
from its Agricultural Mechanization Fund.
Disbursement
3.15      IDA's disbursement would take about four years from the date of
effectiveness (Annex 12). Disbursements would be made against appropriate
statements and documents for 75% of payments against (a) Project loans made
by NACF (US$10.0 million) and (b) training facilities (US$215,000), and 100%
of foreign expenditures for (a) services of farm management expert and mushroom
conisultant (US$75,000), and (b) management consultant services (US$210,000).
If the amounts allocated to any category would no longer be required, they
woujld be re-allocated to another category.
E. Project Administration
3.16      NACF would administer the Project.  It would establish a technical
unit, headed by a Project Manager who would be assisted by an internationally
recruited farm management expert. The Project Manager would report directly
to the Vice-President in charge of credit. The technical unit would be
responsible for formulating criteria for loan appraisal; for training and
supervising the regular appraisal staff, both at NACF headquarters and at
the Kun level; for adopting these criteria and procedures for Project
operations; and, generally, for monitoring the Project in all its aspects.
Aside from administrative assistants, the technical unit would initially
include at least one technician each for sericulture, livestock, horticulture,
and farm management. To minimize duplication of existing staff and services
and to ensure coordination within NACF, the Project Manager would be
authorized to enlist the cooperation of technicians in NACF's livestock and
farm management and marketing departments. To ensure overall coordination
between NACF and other agencies involved in the Project, an assurance was
obtained at negotiations that a Project Coordinating Committee would be
appointed as indicated in the guidelines set out in Annex 4.
IV. THE NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVE FEDERATION
General
4.01      NACF, established in 196i, is the apex organization of the agri-
cultural cooperative structure in Korea.  Its membership consists of 140 Kun
cooperatives and 154 special cooperatives of orchard growers and livestock
famrers.  Aware of the problems arising from the rapid expansion of its
operations, NACF has taken some steps to deal with them, but efforts are
sc.i:L' inadequate and have to be accelerated.



- 13 -
Kun Cooperatives
4.02      The 140 Kun cooperatives, with about 400 branches, constitute the
key tier of the cooperative structure. NACF and Kun cooperatives are distinct
legal and financial entities but are closely integrated in regard to adminis-
tration, management, resource mobilization, and lending operations. For
presentation of data on deposits and loans, however, NACF and Kun cooperatives
are treated in this appraisal as a single entity. The President of NACF appoints
the presidents of Kun cooperatives and NACF shares its personnel with them,
recruits part of their staff, instructs them on policies and procedures, and
provides them with subsidies. Project loans would be routed through Kun
cooperatives that meet specified criteria (Annex 5).
Resources
4.03      The resources of NACF and Kun cooperatives as of the end of 1970
amounted to about W 225 billion, including share capital and reserves amounting
to W 7 billion, borrowings from Government (W 57 billion), borrowings from
Bank of Korea (W 33 billion) and deposits (W 95 billion).  Deposits, which
were over WI 100 billion at appraisal, exceeded twice their 1968 level and,
of these, more than a fifth came from farmers.  Borrowings from Government and
the Bank of Korea were at concessionary interest rates and included fertilizer
financing.
Use of Resources
4.04      The broad distribution of the use of the resources of NACF and
Kun cooperatives as of the end of 1970 was as follows:
(W billion)
Supply and Marketing                      50
Insurance                                  6
Credit                                   129
Fixed Assets                              10
Miscellaneous                             30
Total                              225
(a)  Su.pplies:  Sales of fertilizer (on a monopoly basis),
farm chemicals, and agricultural machinery are at sub-
sidized prices and partly on credit. Operations are
financed mainly from a Bank of Korea credit and budgetary
funds. Fertilizer business is affected by slow payments
by Government and high inventory levels.
(b) Marketing: NACF markets some cash crops and other farm
produce through auction at certain centers and by direct
sales to the armed forces. It also purchases produce on
Government account.
(c) Insurance: Insurance business - which includes life,
livestock, fire, and education - is financed from premia
and other receipts.



- 14 -
(d)  Miscellaneous:  NACF provides some facilities for
transportation and storage of agricultural produce, for
cooperative education and training, and for agricultural
extension.
Lending Operations
4.05      NACF makes loans for agricultural and non-agricultural operations
to individuals, cooperatives, and agricultural associations. Borrowings from
Government and the Bank of Korea mainly help finance agricultural loans while
other loans are made from deposit resources. Loans advanced by NACF and Kun
cooperatives grew from W 32 billion in 1965 to W 185 billion in 1970 and
outstanding loans from W 21 billion to W 105 billion. The proportion of loans
advanced for non-agricultural purposes such as housing increased from 38%
in 1966 to 54% in 1970.
4.06      Most short-term loans for agricultural production carry an interest
rate of 15%. Medium-term loans are made for cash crops, sericulture, and
livestock, and for relief in case of disaster. These loans are usually advanced
for five years and carry interest at 9%. NACF also provides seasonal loans
for working capital to some cooperatives and associations at a rate of 22%.
The same rate applies to commercial credit, which includes financing of
commercial farmers and urban commercial ventures and loans against fixed
deposits. Export credit (for mushroom and silk cocoons) is, h-towever, charged
only 6%. Long-term loans for 35 years are made to irrigation associations at
3.5%.
Operating Results
4.07      Although NACF's overall operating results can be considered satis-
factory, it is difficult to evaluate the success of each of its activities.
This is partly due to the fact that some of these are service functions such
as guidance on which no income is earned. Further, some of the operations
are subsidized by Government. A preliminary analysis by NACF shows that
credit, insurance and fertilizer operated at a profit in 1970, while marketing
and purchasing activities lost.
Financial Position
4.08      NACF's paid-in capital and reserves amounted to only W 2,600
million as of the end of 1970, compared with short-term and long-term
liabilities of W 115 billion, which included borrowings from Government of
about W 50 billion. This situation has resulted from poor profits, the
absence of any link between borrowing by its members and their shareholding,
and the rapid increase in its operations. However, apart from making
signiflcant progress in deposit mobilization, NACF and affiliated cooperatives
l.ive been engaged in a drive to increase share capital. Further, though the
equity of NACF lhas been small, Government has strengthened NACF financially by
providing lotu-s from tiute to timue.  To enable NACF to build up its equity,
assuraices were obtained that NACF would require its member cooperatives



- 15 -
to invest in its shares to the extent of at least 2% of their borrowings
from it by December 31, 1973 and 3% by December 31, 1974.
Special Fund
4.09      The special fund (para 3.13) would be made up of the proceeds
from the IDA credit, which would be transferred to NACF on the basis of
sub-loan disbursements and the sum of W 1,400 million, which Government has
agreed to provide as loan by September 1, 1974. Of the latter, an initial
sum of W 350 million would be provided as a condition of credit effectiveness
and the balance from time to time so that the amount available in the fund
is always at least W 350 million. Upon completion of the study of NACF by
management consultants (para 4.21), Government would decide, in consultation
with IDA, whether the resources in the special fund would be retained as a
long-term loan or held in some other form. If retained as a loan, the
repayment period should not be less than 15 years, including five years of
grace. NACF would pay interest at 7% per annum on the proceeds of the IDA
credit and the Government loan. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that NACF would utilize the special fund resources in line with the policy
statement agreed with IDA (Annex 5).
Arrears and Collection
4.10      Loan recovery was adversely affected by bad crops in 1967, 1968,
and 1970 and the arrears of NACF and Kun cooperatives rose from W 3 billion
in 1966 to W 9 billion (8.9% of outstanding loans) in 1970. This deterioration
also reflects the impact of the rapid expansion of NACP operations and of
the shortage of resources that led NACF to make medium-term loans for
agriculture in smaller amounts and for shorter periods than were necessary
(para 4.16). Overdues for more than one year constituted only about 2% of
outstanding loans and largely related to "usury debt" loans made to farmers,
on Government direction, for clearing their debts to moneylenders. Collection
records have otherwise been generally satisfactory. Liberal extensions
(permitted if interest and at least a part of principal are paid), however,
distort the picture so that the situation cannot be estimated precisely.
NACF management has been watching with concern the increase in overdues and
taken effective measures to keep them within reasonable limits. Assurances
were obtained that active collection drives would be continued, that the
procedure for granting extensions would be revised, relating them to crop
failure; that data would be collected on amounts falling due for repayment
and on amounts extended, and that NACF would determine the period of loans on
the basis of debt service capacity (para 4.16).
4.11      At the end of 1970, NACF had accumulated W 661 million of bad
debts resulting from long-term irrigation and usury debt loans at Government
instance. NACF lhas sought, but not yet received, a Government grant for the
write-off of these. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that an amount
of W 661 million would be made available to NACF by Government by December 31,
1973 for writing off bad debts. Other bad debts of NACF and Kun cooperatives,
at the end of 1970, were roughly estimated at about W 1,500 million, which
is a negligible proportion of loan portfolio. The extent of bad debts
cannot be precisely ascertained, mainly because of NACF's liberal loan



- 16 -
extension policy (para 4.10). Availability of quasi-equity capital from
long-term loans (para 4.09) would enable NACF to improve its profits and
malke provision for bad and doubtful debts. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained that NACF would create and maintain an appropriate level of
provision for writing off bad debts in line with the auditor's recommendations
(para 4.23).
Organization and Management
4.12      The General Assembly of NACF, made up of member cooperatives, elects
auditors and, through the Representatives Meeting elected by it, approves
NACF's business plan, budget and accounts. The Administration Board, the
policy-making body, consists of the President of NACF (appointed by the
President of the Republic of Korea), the Ministers in charge of Finance and
Agriculture and Forestry, the Governor of the Bank of Korea, and five members
elected by the Representatives Meeting, including two agricultural economists
(Annex 3).
4.13      The President of NACF is assisted by two Executive Vice-presidents
and six other vice-presidents (Annex 3, Chart 2). NACF total staff is about
1,500, including agricultural technicians.
4.14      The top management of NACF is experienced and generally competent
but experience in appraising and supervising development loans is limited.
Loan appraisal methods and procedures would be improved by the technical
urtit to be set up under the Project (para 3.16). Establishment of the unit
and appointment of the Project Manager and the farm management expert (in
consultation with, and on terms and conditions satisfactory to, IDA) would
be conditions of credit effectiveness.
Training
4.15      Most of NACF's staff have completed a two-year course at its
Agricultural Cooperative College, which also runs training courses for
cooperative staff and leaders. Facilities, however, need expansion and
courses should be more practical and emphasize lending policies and procedures.
A series of special courses of six to eight weeks would, therefore, be
organized at the college, each to train 20 to 25 members of the appraisal
staff of NACF and Kun cooperatives.  NACF would be assisted by the farm
management expert in preparing a syllabus and teaching materials and in
organizing and conducting the courses (para 3.09). Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that such courses would be organized.
Terms and Conditions of Project Loans
4.16      Because of NACF's lack of resources and suitable staff, the size
of loans and their maturity are often determined more with a view to extensive
coverage of borrowers and rapid turnover of funds than on financial and
technical considerations. Norms would, therefore, be drawn up for each type
of investment in regard to the required outlay and incremental production and



- 17 -
income, and be used as the basis for loan appraisal. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that lending policies of NACF would be improved
as indicated.
4.17      The staff of NACF and Kun cooperatives would assist applicants
with their loan requests and appraise sub-loans on the basis of farm plans
and returns from incremental investments. Loans would be supervised by
technical staff who would periodically visit the sub-borrowers' farms.
4.18      NACF would normally make Project loans to farmers through Kun
cooperatives satisfying the conditions set out in the policy statement on
financial soundness and operational efficiency (Annex 5). Where the loans
could not be routed through a Kun cooperative, NACF would lend directly to
the sub-borrower.
4.19      Interest rates charged by NACF on agricultural loans vary according
to source of funds and purpose of loan. Rates on borrowings From the Bank
of Korea and the Government range from 2% to 8% and, further,- 'hq Government
has agreed to subsidize NACF to cover the difference between the'cost of
its deposits and the rate it charges on agricultural medium-ter* loans. The
existing rate of 9% on medium-term loans appears unduly low, and prevents
NACF from earning significant profits, despite subsidies. On ta average,
the cost of NACF's deposit resources is 12%, and present administrative costs,
roughly estimated at about 2%, will go up if appraisal an4 superviion
improve. The rate should also help cover bad debts and include a 3% margin
for the Kun cooperatives that would channel the loans. A rpte higher than
the existing 9% would be well within the capacity of the sub-borrowers who
represent the commercial sub-sector of Korean agriculture. They will receive
a financial rate of return of 18% or more and would not be required to bear
any substantial rise in taxes. Nor is an increase in the existing rate
likely to discourage them, as Project loans would be larger and have longer
maturity than those granted by NACF at present. The rate of inflation in
Korea has been 8 to 10% per annum in the last few years and is likely to con-
tinue in this range for several more. The interest rate should therefore be
sufficiently high to offset the loss in value of the principal and to cover
increasing costs. The ruling interest rates on loans and deposits, even in
the Institutional sector, have been relatively high in Korea (Annex 2, Table 1),
and therefore funds advanced at the low rate of 9% for agricultitral purposes
could be diverted to other uses. On all these considerations, a minimum
rate of interest of 15% on medium-term agricultural loans would be justified.
I{owever, as too drastic a rise over the present rate of 9% migWht discourage
potential investors, the rate would be raised to 12%. Any rate below
this would imply a definite subsidy to farmers. Assurances were obtained
at negotiations that the rate of interest charged to sub-borrowers on the
,ediwu-terni and long-term  loans under the Project would be raised to not
less thlan 12% as a condition of credit effectiveness. A margin of 3% would
be paid to Kun cooperatives.
4.20      Caslh flows of typical sub-borrowers given in farik models (Annexes
3 to 11) show that the following repayment periods for loans woi*ld be
appropriate:

Assurances were obtained that these periods would not be exceeded.
Administrative and Accounting Organization
4.21      NACF has expanded and diversified operations considerably in the
last few years and, as a result, accounts and other management information
have not yet been so organized that NACF's operational policies can be quickly
or accurately determined. Organization and working procedures must also be
streamlined.  NACF has made some improvements such as changing the depart-
mental set-up and attempting estimates of results by business sector, but
the available information is still inadequate for management purposes.
Similar problems also exist at the Kun cooperatives level. A review of the
existing organizational, financial, and accounting procedures of NACF and,
to the extent required, of Kun cooperatives, is, therefore, necessary. An
international firm of management consultants would be invited, after consult-
ation with IDA, to undertake the review, recommend measures for improvement
and assist in their implementation, including the installation of a system
oi cost accounting for NACF. Terms of Reference would be as in Annex 7, sub-
ject to modification in the light of the study of certain broad aspects of
the working of NACF now in progress as part of an agricultural sector review
being carried out by the Michigan State University at the request of the
Korean Government and with funding by USAID. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that, following this study, Government would agree with IDA
on a program for the implementation of mutually agreed recommendations
(Lncluding modifications thereof) and take all measures necessary for such
implementation.
4.22      Government and NACF would review NACF's various activities and
determine necessary measures for improving its operating results. It would
bie particularly important to ensure that NACF is adequately compensated
by Government for losses suffered whenever it is required by Government to
charge lower prices for its facilities and services than are justified by
ciDst. Assurances were obtained from Government at negotiations that whenever
Government directs NACF to perform any services, Government would provide
sufficient funds to NACF to ensure that it does not incur any loss in perform-
ing such services.



- 19 -
Audit
4.23      NACF's operations are supervised by the Ministries of Agriculture
and Finance, the Bank of Korea and the National Assembly Investigation
ComFnittees, and audited by the Board of Inspection of Government insofar as
Government funds are involved. The only comprehensive audit, however. Is
that made by two auditors elected by the General Assembly, but since it is
done with the assistance of NACF staff, it does not meet V)A's normal
independent audit requirements. Therefore, NACF accounts would have to be
audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA.  Assurances to this effect
were obtained during negotiations. The first independent audit relating to
NACF's accounts for the year to December 31, 1971 started in February 1972
and tlhe final audit report will be submitted to IDA not later than 3 months
after credit effectiveness. An interim report containing the preliminary
findings and views of the auditors has, however, been received. For subse-
quent years, final audit reports would be submitted within four months of
the close of each financial year.

/1   It is assumed that world production will increase by 4% for silk and
by 5% for mushrooms (FAD and IBRD economic department estimates); Korean
production would increase by 15% for silk and 10% for mushrooms.
B. Marketing and Prices
Fruit and Livestock Products
5.03      Incremental Project output of apples, grapes, peaches, pears,
broilers, pork, and eggs, which would be predominantly for the domestic mar-
ket, appears modest, especially in view of the time needed to reach full
development. The income elasticities of demand in growing urban centers are
relatively high, ranging from 0.44 for peaches to 1.02 for poultry meat
(paras 2.11 and 2.14). Priority for on-farm investments under the Project
is based largely on these favorable domestic market prospects, though tinere
are also possibilities of exporting to Japan. Prices of fruit, livestock and
poultry products have been firm, rising more rapidly than the index of all
agricultural commodities (Annex 1, Table 3).
Silk
5.04      The world demand for raw silk, after a short period of decrease
because of preference for synthetic fibers, has shown a constant increase
since 1965 (Annex 9, Table 2) and is expected to continue to expand (para
5.02). FAQ estimates that the gradual upward trend will average 4% a
year 1/. Export prices in recent years have also shown a rising trend,
which has enabled Korea to maintain a comfortable balance in the stabiliza-
tion fund, while granting farmers progressive increases in cocoon prices
(Annex 9).
Mushroom
5.05      In Korea, domestic consumption of mushrooms is confined mostly
to the wild variety, while mushroom raising specializes in those for export
only. Export of cultivated mushrooms has shown a remarkable upwardl trend
(Annex 10) and, up to now, the main limiting factor has been the country's
mushroom raising capacity. Processors generally buy at prices that exceed
guaralnteed minimum producer prices. Export prices and producer prices have
increased steadily since 1965.

- 21 -
Market Channels and Outlets
5.06      Farmers have a choice among a variety of market channels and out-
lets, which are described in detail in Annexes 1 and 8 to 11. Processing
facilities for fruit and mushrooms are adequate. Although most fruit and
livestock products are handled through private trade channels, cooperatives
play a significant role in marketing. NACF operates several marketing
centers in each of the five main urban markets (Seoul, Pusan, Taegu, Kwangju,
and Taejon), at which fruit, vegetables, eggs and other commodities are sold
at auction to accredited merchants who, in turn, sell to retailers and/or
consumers. The percentage of fruit processed in 1969 (apples, 1%; grapes,
12%; peaches, 7%; and pears, 14%) is small but increasing, and the loan now
under consideration by the Federal Republic of Germany would assist NACF in
expanding and improving cold storage and processing facilities. Marketing
of cocoon and mushrooms is regulated by Government under the 1971 Export
Promotion Law, which requires exclusive sale to processors directly or through
NACF for export (Annexes 9 and 10).
C. Producers' Benefits
5.07      Based on assumptions detailed in nine illustrative farm models
(Annexes 8, 9, 10 and 11), the financial results of Project investments are

5.08      When all on-farm investments have reached full maturity, the farmers
benefiting from sub-loans would be assessed for payment of land tax at the
rate of 20% of 'standard' net income. However, the standard net income
established by Government on a regional basis does not take into account the
incremental production resulting from new investments (Annex 1). Under
existing tax legislation, the farmer's projected net income may not, there-
fore, lead to substantial new tax liability.
5.09      Farm models show financial rates of return ranging from 18% to 58%.
Varied sensitivity tests were applied to each model, assuming lower net
benefit streams due to less favorable performance in investment costs,
operating costs, and output prices. Financial rates of return remained
satisfactory in all cases. The poultry and swine models, however, have shown
marked sensitivity to lower sale prices, which is not unusual in these
industries, especially in broiler and egg production where profit margins
per unit are generally low. This sensitivity is due to the assumption
that these farms would depend exclusively on purchased rather than on-farm
produced feed (Appendixes 11-1, 11-2 and 11-3). However, production parameters
are conservatively estimated, based on constant feed conversion factors,
though they are expected to improve gradually. Aside from market and
production risks considered in these sensitivity tests, success of the
mushroom, poultry, swine, and sericulture tub-projects would largely depend
oni the quality of individual management. These risks, which do exist in
view of the large number of participating farmers, would be miniriLized
through guidance and supervision by NACF's specially trained loan officers
and techlnicians.
VI.  ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The Project would extend financial support to about 12,000 farners
and enable them to meet their investment pi**, which have so far been diffi-
cult to realize because of the shortage of credit.  These would include about
9,000 farmers engaged in sericulture who would be enabled to progress from
the traditional to the modern sector and attain the more rewarding economies
of scale. Loans under the Project would also supplement agricultural progranm
oi- Government (paras 2.07 and 2.08).
6.02      Accurate data on the net employment resulting from the Project
are not available; however, increased labor requirements for farm exploit-
at:ion will increase working hours (sericulture and swine) for labor that is
a:Lready employed and also generate opportunities for employing additional
people (orchard, mushroom, and poultry). The equivalent of full-time jobs
(300 days a year) generated by the Project would be about 6,000, distributed
as follows:
Orchard  Sericulture  Mushroom  Poultry  Swine   Total
Niumber of Farms      2,500      9,000           20        500     250    12,270
NuDmber of Jobs       2,500       1,800         640        720     100      5,760



- 23 -
The incremental wages to be paid would average W 850 million (US$2.3 mil-
lion). Based on the estimated income per rural household of approximately
w 262,000 in 1974, the incremental wage earnings from the Project would
provide income for about 3,500 rural households. This does not include the
incremental employment and earnings generated by processing and marketing.
6.03      On the institutional side, the Project would provide for tech-
nical services that would help NACF improve the skill of its credit
operations staff and initiate the process of NACF reorganization.
6.04      The overall impact on the balance of payments (about US$9 million
equivalent per year by 1979) would not be substantial, as only mushrooms,
c.ilk, and small quantities of fruit would be exported.
6.05      For the Project as a whole, the taxes generated by Project invest-
ments and operations would be largely offset by the bulk of subsidies paid
by-the Government (para 5.08). However, poultry and swine would generate
approximately W 240 million annual tax revenue a year (Annex 13 and Appendixes
13-1, 13-2 and 13-3).
6.06      The rate of return to the economy would be 37% ranging from 18% for
sericulture to more than 100% for poultry and swine (Annex 13, Appendixes 13-1
to 13-3). Various sensitivity tests applied to the costs and benefits still
give satisfactory rates of return. The high return shown by poultry and swine
models is largely due to the relatively high tax component of the imported
ingredients of the feed meal and to the good prices paid for meat and eggs
in Korea.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, the following principal points were agreed to:
That Government would:
(a)  make a sum of W 350 million available for setting up a
special fund in NACF as a condition of credit effectiveness
and provide, in all, a sum of W 1,400 million (inclusive of
this sum of W 350 million) as a loan to NACF not later than
September 1, 1974 which will be for a period of not less than
15 years and pass on the proceeds of the IDA credit to NACF
on the same terms and ensure that this Special Fund is
constituted and operated as set out in Annex 5 (para 4.09);
(b)  make available a sum of W 661 million to NACF by December

And that NACF would:
(a)  construct buildings whenever their total cost exceeded
US$75,000 subject to local competitive bidding (para 3.14);
(b)  require member cooperatives to invest in NACF shares to
the extent of at least 3% of their borrowing from it by

(c)  arrange for an international firm of management
consultants to study the existing system of the
accounts and organization of NACF and implement their
recommendations, as agreed with IDA (4.21).
7.02      Conditions of effectiveness are:
that Government would:

of a special fund in NACF (para 4.09);
and NACF would:
(a)  establish the technical unit and appoint the.Project Manager
and the farm management expert on terms of reference satisfactory
to IDA (para 4.14 and Annex 6); and
(b)  raise the rate of interest charged to sub-borrowers on
the medium and long-term loans under the Project to 12%
(para 4.19).
7.03      Subject to the above conditions, the Project is considered
suitable for an IDA credit of US$10.5 million.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Agricultural Background
weneral
The Republic of Korea (ROK) has a total land area of approximately
10 million ha, of which about 2.5 million ha (1 million ha irrigated) are
cultivated, 6.5 million are in natural vegetation and forest, and 1.0 mil-
lion are in basic infrastructure and cities. Of the total cropped area
(3.6 million ha), about 80% is devoted to cereals and soybeans; one-third
(1.3 million ha) of the cropped area is in paddy.
2.        ROK is a hilly country of diverse geology--archeozoic rocks,
granite, gneiss, mica schists and other metamorphics; cretaceous and
tertiary sedimentary in the southeastern part of the peninsula; and volcanic
in the southwest coast and Cheju Island. Four-fifths of its surface is
below 500 m of elevation. The eastern coast is rugged, while the western
coast is a network of estuaries and tidal flats. Main rivers (Han, Nakdong,
Somjin, Yongsan and Kum) originate in the east and central "hilly backbone"
and drain to the west and south.
3.        Most of the intensively farmed land is alluvial and lies along
the river basins, valleys and coastal margins. The south has more extensive
plains and is favored by a mild winter. While all valley lands are settled
and under some form of utilization, future gains in production and produc-
tivity can be achieved by:
(a) using improved seeds and planting material;
(b) rearranging paddy fields (irrigation and drainage)
and consolidating land;
(c) improving watershed management;
(d) switching to high value crops;
(e) minimizing use of valley lands for basic infrastructure;
(each year about 10,000 ha of good cultivated land goes
to urban uses, factories, highways, and such); and
(f) developing and settling high uplands.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
4.        Although piedmonts and mountains (high uplands) are practically
umtouched, some hills have been denuded of their original coniferous trees
and now are either covered by a secondary growth of herbs and bushes or
devoted to rainfed crops, reforestation and human settlement. These
uplands have good potential, and studies and watershed management pilot
schemes show that several hundred thousand hectares could be brought into
high-yield production (para 13).
5.        The climate is continental.  ROK has a pronounced rainy season
iLn the summer and dry winters. The yearly rainfall varies from about 1,600
mm along the southern shores to 800 mm in the area adjacent to Taegu.
Average annual temperatures increase from 10C in the north to 15"C farther
esouth. Winter temperatures are well below freezing. However, by using
greenhouses made of bamboo and plastic, growing seasons are extended for
hligh value crops. Farm production is subject to fluctuations resulting
from drought and typhoons.
Role of Agriculture in the Economy
6.        Agriculture 1/ contributes to 28Z of the GDP and about 26X of
anual export value.  It also provides a livelihood for nearly half of the
population.  Agriculture grew at 5.5% from 1962 to 1966 and 2.9% annually
from 1967 to 1969. During 1969, GNP growth registered an all-time high of
15.9Z (13.3% in 1968). All major targets of the Second Five-Year Develop-
ment plan, ending in 1971, were exceeded, except those in the agricultural
_ector. While the Third Plan (1972-76) postulates an accelerated rate of
growth in agriculture, it also predicts that agriculture's share in the
economy will decline to about 21% of GNP by 1976.
Production and Trade
7.        Production.  Except for vegetables, fruits (especially apples)
and cocoon, overall crop production has shown no significant increase
(Table 1). The upward trend of fruit and vegetables is due partly to
skilled and price-responsive farmers, partly to physical integration of
the country through a network of modern highways and transport facilities 2/,
and partly to the income elasticities of demand among the urban population.
Mushroom and cocoon production have increased in response to favorable
export markets. Grain, especially rice production, has been encouraged
through Government policies designed to support prices above those of
world markets, subsidize farm inputs and reach self-sufficiency in rice.
1/ Agriculture includes livestock, forestry and fisheries.
2/   Credit 25-KO, Credit 110-KO, and Credit 183/Loan 669-KO.



ANNEX 1

8.        Seeds and planting materials are of poor quality and insufficient
in quantity and their distribution leaves much to be desired. This is
reflected in the low yields obtained in crops other than rice, as
well as in the small amount ef progress achieved through crop diversifica-
tion. Improved seeds, as the core of a well-managed "package", where land,
water and fertilizer play important roles, could help Korean agriculture
achieve, during the Third Plan (1972-76), what was not achieved during
the Second--gains in productivity. A more resourceful development program
for seeds ani planting materials would be a step in this direction, as
would Increased institutional support in multiplying and distributing
impgoved planting materials.
9.        Trade.  Agricultural export value has shown an upward trend,
mainly because of increasing shipments of straw mats, mushroom, silk,
tobacco, ginseng and fish products (Table 2). Although agricultural im-
ports have increased at a lesser rate, the increasing reliance on imported
cereals gives rise to concern for reasons of foreign exchange commitments
and the balance of payments. Annual grain imports exceed 2 million m tons
while net agricultural imports have more than quadrupled since 1965. The
following table gives data on grain imports for the last three years:

program has been estimated at US$287 million. Provisional Third Plan
projections are:

Land Tenure and Use
11.       The successful Korean post war land reform established a maximum
size of 3 ha for farm holdings and 20 ha for orchards, range, pasture and
forest lands.  However, average holding in ROK is 0.9 ha.
12.       Government is attempting to improve land use through pilot
schemes for watershed management, with the technical assistance of the
United Nations, and through "crash programs". Three years' experience
with pilot schemes in three small watersheds (Ansong Chon, Tonjin and
Sartgju) indicates that, through water management, bench terracing, small
dans and flood control, unused high uplands can be converted into properly
cultivated land at reasonable cost. Preliminary results demonstrate that:
(a)  with proper rural zoning, drainage, irrigation, lime,
and fertilizer, rainfed paddy yields can be increased
from 3.3 to 5.3 tons per ha;
(b)  1 ha of fishponds could, on the average, irrigate 6 ha
of paddy and still maintain 1-m depth of water for
fish culture; and
(c)  high uplands have good potential for forestry and
livestock development, the latter through range and
pasture management.
13.       One of the two crash programs initiated in 1968 involves ground-
water development in the southern part of the country. The other deals
with land consolidation and paddy rearrangement. During the Second Plan
period, 150,000 ha of land were consolidated and an area of equal size is
to be consolidated by 1976 under the Third Plan. The newly created
Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC, established in 1970) has assumed
responsibility for both programs, including agricultural mechanization and
rural housing.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
Support Services
14.       The main Government and semi-Government agencies supporting
agriculture (besides NACF) are:
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAF);
The Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC); and
The Agriculture and Fisheries Development Corporation (AFDC).
T'he MAF formulates agricultural policy; through its Office of Rural Develop-
ment (ORD) it conducts research and advises farmers through a nationwide
extension service; MAF is especially active in a seed-improvement program;
maintaining and improving quality standards of agricultural commodities is
one of its more important regulatory functions.
15.       Pricing of vegetables, fruit, and livestock products is not
regulated or controlled. Such items are sold either on the basis of
contractual arrangements (with processing plants, brokers, dealers) or
in the marketing centers by auction to accredited merchants. Because of
the relative freedom allowed in marketing this category of commodity,
prices of vegetables, fruit, and livestock products increased by about 150.1%
116.3% and 112.7% respectively from 1965 to 1970, during which the average
rate of increase for the entire agriculture sector was about 91.4% (Table 3).
16.       Government is backing its agricultural policy with an active
subsidization of certain inputs which should, in turn, influence indirectly
the level of prices. Government subsidies on main items in 1970 were as
follows:
Selected Planting and Breeding Stocks:         30-60%
Farm Equipment;
Power tiller (10 hp)                         23%
Power duster                                 11%
Power sprayer                                48%
Speed sprayer                                40%
Fertilizers:                                   30-40%
17.       In 1968, the subsidy on farm equipment provided by the Central
Government reached a peak of W 606 million (US$1.6 million), while fer-
tilizer support amounted to W 1.6 million in 1968 and W 3.3 million in 1969.
Farm mechanization subsidies were financed almost totally from the Property
and Claims Fund (official Japanese transfers), which had an approximate
balance of US$400,000 available at the beginning of 1971. It is expected
that the subsidy will be substantially reduced in 1971 and nearly eliminated,
for power tillers, in 1972.

]Marketing
18.       The Korean marketing system faces ever-increasing demands.  The
index of farm production, which increased from 95 in 1965 to 119 in 1969, is
expected to increase further to 166 by 1976. Urban population, 50% of the
total in 1969, is projected to reach 58% by 1976.

,'2 According to a sample survey, the percentage had already reached
54 in 1970.
19.       One phenomenon associated with urbanization and rising per capita
:income is the income elasticity of demand for perishable and bulky commodities:
fruit and vegetables and livestock products. In order to meet the increasing
demands upon the market system, Government proposes to provide:
(a)  an improved rural infrastructure, especially
feeder roads (little progress has been made so
far) and rural market centers for assembling
produce for dispatch to terminal markets (Govern-
ment has a program for establishing cooperative
assembling centers for produce along its growing net
work of super highways);
(b)  storage and processing facilities (NACF's existing
facilities are to be expanded with the help of a
USAID loan and financial assistance from the Federal
Republic of Germany is also under consideration);



ANNEX 1
Page 7
(c) improved terminal market facilities (some of which
have been financed by the Asian Development Bank);
(d) higher standards for grading, handling and sanitation
at all levels (much remains to be accomplished); and
(e)  an effective system for gathering, analyzing and
disseminating statistical information on market
arrivals, sales and prices (much remains to be done
along these lines).
20.       In the domestic market, farm produce may flow through one of the
following channels:
(a) individual merchants;
(b) private firms;
(c) cooperative or Government channels; or
(d) a combination of these.
The share that flows through cooperative channels (mainly NACF or affiliated
county level or specialized cooperatives) averages 30% of vegetables and
eggs; 30 to 40% of rice reaching commercial markets; 35% of fruit; and
100% of the sericulture output (cocoon). In total, NACF's marketing
activities in 1968 accounted for W 40 billion, or 50% of the estimated
value of all farm output marketed that year. Export marketing, which is
controlled by Government, is shared by private firms, NACF and Government
although farmers and processors appear to have a preference for private
export firms.
Taxation
21.       The rural sector makes a relatively limited contribution to
Government's tax revenues.  In 1968 and 1969, taxes and public charges
paid by the farmers amounted to about W 7.8 billion and W 11.0 billion,
respectively, or approximately 3.7% and 4% of total tax revenue for the
same years.  Under existing provisions, 30.5% of the internal tax revenue
is transferred by Central Government to local governments: 17.6% for
financing general local expenditure and 12.9% for financing the local
autonomous school bodies.
22.       The taxes and public charges paid by farmers consist of taxes
on expenditure, including custom duties on imported goods and taxes on
production and income representing, mainly, agricultural land taxes.
Farm inputs subject to import duty are mostly chemicals and machinery,
including spare parts. Custom duties for chemicals are as follows:



ANNEX 1
Page 8
(a) Wetting and emulsifying agents, 40% of CIF price;
(b) Solvents, 20% of CIF price; and
(c) Finished farm chemicals, 25% of CIF price.
Farm machinery and parts that can be purchased in Korea from local suppliers
canmot be imported, except under special circumstances.  Such special cases
must be decided by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF): if
permaission to import is granted, items are subject to 100% tax (50% customs
and 50% special duty). MAF is authorized to waive these taxes if the
situation warrants such action.
23.       For tax purposes, agricultural land is classified into Class A
(mainly paddy and barley land) and Class B (mainly upland). For each,
taxable net income is determined on the basis of standard production, prices
and costs, as ascertained through annual farm business surveys. Tax payable
on Class A land is 6% on "standard" net income, while the rates payable
on lClass B are:
(a) 10% on net income below W 60,000;
(b) 15% on net income from W 60,000 to W 180,000; and
(c) 20% on net income above W 180,000.
24.       In the long run, i.e., when all on-farm investments have reached
full maturity, the farmers benefiting from sub-loans would be assessed for
payment of land tax at the rate of 20% of "standard" net income, as defined
under Class B above. The Project would not generate significant incremental
tax revenue for two reasons: first, tax liabilities are assessed on the
basLs of standard income, rather than on actual income and, second, there
is a provision under which newly established poultry and swine farms are
100% exempt for the first six years and 50% exempt for the following three,
whiLe newly exploited (orchard) land is exempt for six years.

AGRICTJLTURAL CRREDIT PROJECT
Banking and Agricultural Credit
lanking gvstem
1.        The hanking svstem of Korea consists principally of:  (a) six
commercti1 banks with a nationwide network of branches: (b) seven local
1,anlos, each with a smaller area of operation: (c) six branch offices of
foreinn hanks and (d) seven specialized banks, viz., Citizens' National
sank of Korea, Yorean Pousing Bank, National Agricultural Cooperative
reAeratforn eTACF), Central Federation of Fisheries' Cooperatives, Korean
rxchanie Aank, Rorean Development Bank, and Medium Industry Bank.  All the
hranklne institutions are subject to the statutory authority of the Bank of
Vorea, which, as the central bank of the country, is vested with powers of
currencv issue, credit control and bank sunervision. There are, in all,
1,432 bank branches in the countrv, a third of them being in Seoul and
'usan.  The commercial. banks accounted for 314 offices; the provincial
banks for At, NACF, Kun Cooperatives and the Federation of Fisheries'
Cooneratives for 751; and the other specialized banks for 281.
Bank of Korea
9.        The Aank of Korea has been operating indirect controls (such as
the reRulation of the reserve ratio) as well as direct controls (e.g.,
ceiling on hank credit), in coordination with relevant fiscal policies of
Covernment, so as to promote stability in the monetary and credit aspects
of the economv. The bank's outstanding loans and discounts increased
from UT 35 m17illion at the beginning of 197O to W 90 million at the end of
the vear and covered accommodation for agricultural, export and other
-mmerrial mirnoses.
lton-bank Vinancfal Tnstitutions
3.        Forea also has three important non-bank financial institutions viz.,
AOric,tlttiral and Fisheries Develorment Corporation (AFDC), the Korea
Tnvestment fnevelonment Cooperation (mainly designed to foster the capital
market in Korea), and the Korea Development Finance Corporation, engaged
in indumstrial financinA, underwriting, etc.  The AFDC, a government-owned
ctatmitorv cornoration, finances equitv investment and makes long-term and
'hort-term lnans for the development of industries connected with products
om anrintiltture, forestrv and fisherles. Some of its subsidiaries such as



ANNEX 2
Page 2
silk companies, swine production and processing centers and a dairy plant
provide some credit to farmers and other producers to ensure increased
nroduction.
Sources of Agricultural Credit
4.        The role of commercial banks in agricultural credit in Korea has
been negligible. Their outstanding loans and discounts for agriculture,
forestrY and fisheries at the end of 1970 amounted to W 11,694 million, of
which W 325 million were for financing equipment.  The contribution of
cooperatives to the supply of credit and other services required by agri-
culture was, howqever, more significant.  (The agricultural cooperative
svstem in Torea is described in Annex 3.) According to a Farm Household
Economv Survev, carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry,
of the borrowing of W 12,518 per cultivator household at the end of 1969,
1; ?,5RO (21%) was accounted for by cooperatives and other public organiza-
tions, W R,511 (69%) by individuals, and W 1,421 (11%) by others (including
commercial banks). The survey also shows that only 34.4% of the borrowings
wevnt to finance agricultural purposes whereas more than one-half was for
living exnenses, ceremonies, educational expenses, etc.  An elaborate
'Riral Credit Survey conducted in 1964 showed that agricultural cooperatives
surllnied about 211 of the borrowings of cultivator households, while other
banking institutions accounted for only 1.2%. The important sources of
credit, however, were "other farmers" (45.5%) and "relatives and friends"
AIR.").  Interest rates charged by non-institutional agencies are reportedly
as high as 607 per annum in many instances, though a gradual and limited
decline in such rates is said to have resulted from growth in cooperative
ciredit.
i.lleresr Rates
.         TInterest rates on devosits and loans of banking institutions in
Vorea have been mintained at relatively high levels since 1965 when an
interest rate reform was adopted as part of the monetary policv of the Bank
oiF Rorea aimed at checking inflation, promoting savings and stimulating
the flow of funds into the organized banking system. Lower rates were,
however, permitted for priority sectors such as exports and agriculture.
TLght money policy was also reflected in the reserve requirement ratios of
banks, which, after being lowered in January 1971, stood at 16% for savings
mnd time deposits and 26%i for demand deposits. (The corresponding ratios
for WTACP and countv cooperatives were, however, 13% and 20" respectively.)
TMe last major adjustment of interest rates was made at the time of the
won devaluation in June 1971 mainly with a view to rationalizing the
rates charged on term loans. (Table 1 gives the rates on loans and
limponsts of hAnkine institutions as of June 27, 1971 and the changes made
tlprerafter.)  fnenosit rates range from 10 to 217 and lending rates from
"7 to ?6' excert for nrioritv sectors such as agriculture (a to 157) and
ebesnor t1  1.7

('enera]
Though the cooperative system in Korea is of recent growth, an
orRanization of farmers, known as "Ke" has traditionally functioned at the
village level as a voluntary and informal association for specific pur-
Poses. Winancial associations which provided agricultural credit in
earlier years were reorganized and consolidated in 1956 to form the Korean
Agricultural Banlk, while agricultural cooperatives began to be organized in
1057. The two agencies were merged upon the enactment of the Agricultural
Coonerative Law in 1961. The three-tier agricultural cooperative system
thus evolved consists of the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation
(NACM) at the national level, the county (Kun) cooperatives at the inter-
mediate (county) level, and primary cooperatives at the village base
(Organizational structure is shown in Chart 1). About 93X of the farmer
households in Rorea hold cooperative membership.
2.        The Ri Pong, or village cooperatives, are multi-purpose in their
functions, have an area of operation of one or several villages, and require
a minimum membership of 20 persons.  The NACF has been pursuing a program of
consolidating these cooperatives into larger, viable units at the level of
the Myon (an administrative division smaller than the county). As a result,
their number, wqhich was about 16,000 in 1968, dropped to 6,714 by end-1970
and is expected to be reduced by the end of 1972 to 1,500. The functions
of primary cooperatives at the Myon level are, however, more diversified
than those of the single village cooperatives and constitute a comprehensive
service including distribution of consumer goods and agricultural inputs,
.sGrage, marketing and other facilities.  Primary village cooperatives also
rperate a mutual credit scheme that mobilizes resources from members for
iaking loans for miscellaneous purposes.  Supported by a loan from NACF,
this scheme has made good progress, with deposits of the order of W 3,270
mit.lion and outstanding loans of W 4,512 million by April 1971.
1.        The most important tier of the cooperative structure in Korea is,
in some respects, that of the county cooperatives which function at the
intermediate level and provide all the services required by farmers. There
are 14n  Kim cooperatives, each with a membership of at least 15 Ri Doug
rooperatives, onerating through a countrywide network of about 400 branch
offices that provide banking and other services.  With deposits of W 88,015



ANNEX 3
Page 2
million and outstanding loans of about W 80,000 million at the end of 1970,
tlheir operations are sizeable and closely integrated with those of the
NACF'.
4.        Special cooperatives (outside the three-tier structure) are or-
ganized on the basis of commodities handled rather than geographlcal jurin-
dlction and consist of 60 horticultural and 94 livestock organizations.
Tley provide a wide range of services to their members including, in parti-
cular, inputs and marketing and processing of produce, but excluding credit
in cash.
5.        The National Agricultural Cooperative Federation is the apex
organization of the cooperative structure with headquarters at Seoul
and a branch in each province. The NACF functions as an instrument for the
implementation of national policies in agriculture and is hence intimately
atssociated with Government in its operations. It is partly in pursuance of
this responsibility that it undertakes a variety of banking, trading and
promotional functions, including credit, purchase and supply, marketing,
processing, guidance and management. To coordinate these activities under
the Project with relevant Ministries and other agencies, a Project Coor-
diLnation Committee would be set up as per guidelines in Appendix 3-1.
Constitution
6.        The working of cooperatives is governed by the Agricultural Coop-
erative Law of 1961 and the by-laws of individual Institutions. The president
of each cooperative should, ordinarily, be elected but, in terms of special
le!gislation, the President of the NACF (who is himself appointed by the
President of the Republic of Korea) can appoint the presidents of all other
agricultural cooperatives. Re is, however, authorized to entrust provincial
managers of NACF with the appointment of the presidents of Ri Dong coop-
eratives. The general assembly of MACF, which consists of the represen-
tatives of the member cooperatives, elects representatives and auditors and
may amend the Articles of Incorporation and make recommendations in regard
to other matters. The Representatives Meeting consists of the president and
29) representatives of the member cooperatives and has the power to approve
arid ratify the business plan, budget and statement of accounts for each fiscal
year and to elect members of the Administratlve Board of NACF. Member
cooperatives from each province elect three representatives, and three others
are elected from among the special cooperatives. The chief policymaking
body in NACF is the Administration Board, composed of the President of the
Federation, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Minister of Finance and
(,overnor of Bank of Korea, and five members elected by the Representatives
Meeting, including two agricultural economists.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
7.        Each member of a cooperative is required to buy at least one share.
The value of a share is W 1,000 in the primary cooperatives, W 3,000 in the
special cooperatives and W 10,000 in the Kun cooperatives and NACF. NACF has
been promoting a drive to increase share capital subscription at all levels.
As against targets of W 461.0 million, W 251.3 million and W 1,796.0 million
set for NACF, Kun and village cooperatives for 1970, actual increases
achieved amounted to W 465.0 million, W 233.3 million and W 1,455.0 million,
respectively.
Organitzation and Staff Training
The President of NACP is assisted in his day-to-day direction
of the cooperative system by two Executive Vice-Presidents appointed by him
for a term of three years, subject to the approval of the Administration
Board. One of them is in charge of credit and banking and the other in
charge of non-credit activities. Six more vice-presidents supervise the
various departments. (Details are shown in Chart 2.) The departmental
set-up of NACF has been reorganized from time to time to improve coordination
and integration of related activities. As steps in this direction, the
7 lanning Department and the Fund Operations Department were created to
handle budgeting and mobilization and use of resources, with reference to
the needs of the various business activities. To ensure the independence
of the inspection department, it was placed directly under the charge of the
President. The top management of NACF is generally competent and experienced.
9.        NACF branch offices guide and serve the Kun cooperatives in the
provinces. The headquarters and branches together have a staff of about
1,5nO, which includes a limited number of men with technical knowledge of
agriculture, livestock, animal husbandry, etc. employed mainly in the Farm
Guidance, Livestock Guidance, and Loan Appraisal Departments.
1n.       Staff is recruited periodically by NACF to meet its own re-
quirements as well as those of Kun cooperatives. Most new staff are persons
xho have completed a two-year diploma course at the Agricultural Cooperative
College run by the NACF, though a few university graduates are also recruited
to be trained as officers. In the recruitment examination, there is, however,
miore emphasis on law, accountancy and general knowledge than on agriculture.
,.alaries paid by NACF are better than those of Government but not as high
as those at commercial banks. Qualified persons are said to be sometimes
reluctant to work for NACF, partly because of the wide range of its functions
and partly because of the possibility of their being posted to small towns.
11.       The Cooperative College offers a two-year course in cooperative
business (including practical training) to about 100 candidates selected on
the basis of an entrance examination and on the recommendation of the
President of the Kun cooperative of the area from which the candidate comes.
Fach Particinant receives free tuition and subsistence and undertakes to
work for cooperatives for at least three years. The curriculum of the



ANNEX 3
Page &
course is comprehensive but, because of preoccupation with many geieral
subjects, does not pay sufficient attention to operational aspects of credit
such as appraisal and supervision.
12.       The College also offers the following training facilitie;:
(a) A seminar-type course of one to two weeks for
comparatively high ranking officers such as managers
of Xun cooperatives, section chiefs and managers of
Departments in NACF;
(b) A senior refresher course of one to four weeks for
assistant managers of Kun cooperatives and assistant
chiefs of NACF;
(c) A junior refresher course of one to four weeks for
clerks who have been in service for some time;
(d) A course of three to eight weeks for new employees of
NACF who have not had earlier cooperative training; and
(e) Seminars and courses of one to two weeks for presidents
and managers of village cooperatives.
Clasisrooms and dormitories and teaching staff are generally satif tctory.
The training courses are not practical in their content and do not place
enough emphasis on such matters as scrutiny of credit requests and follow-
up and supervision of loans, and facilities would have to be exparied to
covear growing needs.
13.       As the successful execution of the Project would require, at NACF
headquarters, its branches and Kun cooperatives, staff trained in Loan
appraisal, a series of special training courses of six to eight weiks would
be organized at the Cooperative College. Each course would help; train 20
to 25 staff members and cover (a) the appraisal of Project loan ar lications,
incLuding examination of technical feasibility, scrutiny of propoe d in-
vestment and operational costs and analysis of incremental revenue and
repaying capacity, on the basis of norms and models drawn up for eich
category of sub-projects and (b) follow-up and supervision of loais. Apart
fron lectures by the college staff, there would be talks by some NkCF
officials and a few visiting specialists from the Agricultural Res arch
Institute, the Sericulture Association, mushroom processing factoiLes, and
the Office of Rural Development. The services of the farm managemant expert,
to 'be hired to assist the Project Manager (on terms _of reference fLven in
Annex 6), would also be utilized for the preparation of the syllalus and
teaching materials for the course and for organizing and conductiig the
first two courses.



ANNEX 3
Page 5
14.       It would also be necessary to modify the curriculum for the
cooperative course at the college to incorporate the main aspects of loan
appraisal and to organize a few seminars at the college for office-bearers
of Kun cooperatives participating in the Project. The existing dormitory
and library facilities at the Cooperative College are not sufficient for
the additional training courses and seminars and will have to be expanded.
Lending Policies and Procedures
15.       Credit operations of NACF comprise short-term, medium-term and
long-term loans and cover agricultural and non-agricultural purposes. Some
occommodation is also provided in the form of credit sales and advance
*ayments for purchases.  Loans are made to individuals (both members of
cooperatives and non-members), and to cooperatives, associations and other
juridical persons under terms and conditions that vary according to purpose
and source of funds. Farmers are usually financed through Kun cooperatives
and their branches or directly by NACF, and only rarely through Ri-Dong
cooperatives.
16.       Short-term loans for agricultural production (especially for rice
and barley) are made from banking as well as from budgetary funds, usually at
an interest rate of 15% for a period of less than one year, the due date
being fixed two to three months after harvest to allow for sale of produce
at reasonable prices. Loans up to W 200,000 are based on the borrower's
signature without any supporting collateral or guarantor. Such loans are
also made for other crops in selected areas where there are programs for
increased production. Medium-term loans--usually for five years and in some
instances for eight years--are also made from banking funds as well as from
budgetary funds at an interest rate of 9% and on the security of mortgage
of land or real estate. Medium-term loans are made for such purposes as
raising cash crops (vegetables, ginseng, sericulture) and livestock, for
helping farmers recover from disasters such as drought and flood and for
replacing straw roofs with tiles.
17.       Short-term loans are made to cooperatives and some other
producer associations for working capital purposes and for purchase of
produce from cultivators. NACF also makes short-term loans for coimmercial
purposes: these include (a) working capital loans for commercial farmers;
(b) special export loans for those who raise mushroom, silk cocoons, ramie,
etc. at the low interest rate of 6%, supported by refinancing facilities
from the Bank of Korea; (c) general commercial loans for urban housing,
trade and similar purposes, and (d) loans up to 80% of fixed deposits on
the security of such deposits. All commercial loans (except export finance)
are charged interest at 22%. Long-term loans are made for a period of 35
years at 3.5% to irrigation associations direct or through the Agricultural
Development Corporation.



ANNE. 3

118.      Appraisal methods of NACP and Kun cooperatives need mush improve-
ment. Partly because funds were inadequate for meeting the full require-
mieonts and partly because of the lack of suitable staff for appra:sal, there
has been a tendency to distribute loanable funds widely and to f:x maturi-
ties, mainly with a view to rapid turnover of funds without cons:dering
incremental income and repaying capacity.  Though NACF has been  ecentlv
tirying to improve the quality of appraisal and strengthen the aplraisal
sitaff, it is necessary to review loan policies and appraisal met1ods so as
to base them on technical and financial analysis of projects witl reference
to required outlays, incremental production and income and repay ng capacity.
The far  management expert to be recruited for assisting the Pro ect Manager
would help draw up norms for these purposes and ensure their proi er applica-
tion on appraisal of loan requests in the field. Reorientation .f lending
policies on these loans is also sought through the Policy Statem,nt
(Aknnex 5).
19.       Powers of loan sanction are being increasingly decentr;l4zed by
NACF. Loans up to W 500,000 can be approved by the managers of Iun
cooperatives, while loans above this ceiling but below W 3 milliin can be
approved by the manager of a branch of the NACF, if reconmended 1 y a loan
c,ommittee, consisting of the manager, submanager, and the chief ,f the
c,oncerned section. Still larger loans are approved by the Presi,ent of
the NACF on the recommendation of a loan conmittee consisting of the two
executive vice-presidents and the vice-president and the manager in charge
of the Loan Department.
20.       Separate ceilings have been set for loans for differen  purposes.
IThile these have been fluctuating, the highest limit of loan so  ixed is
for livestock, viz., W 10 million. The ceiling for orchards and sericulture
is W 1 million.  The size of an individual loan is usually restr cted by
t'he shortage of available funds and by the value of the collatertl offered.
In the case of some loans, NACF has tried to obtain the guarante  of the
Government for the repayment of the principal and interest but s; far without
success.
Loan Operations and Collections
21.       There has been a steady expansion of credit provided b  NACF
and Kun cooperatives since 1965, whether judged by the volume of loans
advanced per year or the level of outstanding loans. The propori4 on of
loans for non-agricultural purposes was on the increase in 1969 tnd 1970,
while that for agricultural purposes (especially medium-term loa s) was
declining (Tables 1 and 2). This appears to have resulted partlr from the
policy of providing loans for commercial purposes with a view to attracting
deposits and partly from limited availability of funds from sour es other
than Government for on-lending to agriculture.



ANNEX 3
Page 7
22.       By and large, the arrears position of NACF is manageable (Table 3)
though it is difficuit to assess the recovery performance as no figure
of extended loans is avail.able and a loan could apparently be extended if
interest and part of the principal had been paid. There is an active collec-
tion drive during the last three months of each calendar year, with targets
based on parts of the amounts falling due during the year. Legal action
is envisaged for all loans overdue for more than three months but has been
resorted to in only a limited number of cases. Available information shows
a steady increase in overdues resulting partly from crop failure but the
actual increase might have been larger as amounts extended have also been
included in the figures of loan recoveries (Table 3).
23.       It has been roughly estimated that 84,017 loans of NACF and Kun
cooperatives, amounting to W 1,514 million (inclusive of interest arrears),
were doubtful of recovery as of the end of 1970. Also feared to be uncol-
lectible was a sum of W 661 million, made up of long-term irrigation loans
and the 'usury debt loans' made to farmers for relieving them of the burden
of accumulated debts. A grant has been sought from Government for the
write-off of these amounts as they were advanced in pursuance of state
pc1icies, but NACF has Anot yet been compensated. The NACF has been writing
off bad debts in ema1. amounts by debit to its annual profit and loss
accounts as there ip no reserve or provision for the purpose.
Non-credit Business of NACF
24.       Supply of Farm Inputs and Machinery.  NACF is actively engaged
in various non-cretit activities, the most important of which are the
distribution of farm inputs and the marketing of farm produce. Among the
farm inputs, the major category is fertilizer distribution for which
cooperatives have a monopoly. Though fertilizer consumption, in terms of
nutrients, nearly doubled between 1962 and 1970 and continues to grow,
the increase in domestic production has been such that NACF, which is
required to take over the whole of it, has been forced to accumulate large
inventories, financed by credit from the Bank of Korea. Fertilizer stocks
reached a level of over 1 million tons in 1969 and declined slightly
in the second half of 1970. A second important aspect of the fertilizer
business concerns the obligation of the Government of Korea to pay to NACF
the difference between (a) the sum of the delivery price paid to the manu-
facturer and the operating costs as agreed to by Government, and (b) the
selling price fixed by Government and charged to the farmer. The allowance
for operating costs appears to be insufficient. A sum of W 9,972 million
was due to NACF on fertilizer account from Government as of December 31,
1970. Thirdly, fertilixer, which is distributed through 4,000 cooperative
depots throughout the country, is gold partly for cash and partly on credit.
The period of credit is a few months and the rate of interest is 8.4%. The
proportion of credit sales is declining but is still about 32%. Nearly
one-fourth of receivable8 on this account are in arrears. Fertilizer
business thus appears to be handicapped by high levels of inventories, inade-
quate and delayed compensation for costs incurred and overdues on credit sales.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
25.       NACF and Kun cooperatives also play a major role in the listribu-
tioni of farm chemicals. Pesticides used for paddy are subsidized mnd 70%
of ithe sales are on credit. Considerable emphasis is placed on J .nt or
cooperative spray of chemicals for plant protection.
26.       Power tillers and power dusters or sprayers are the main items of
farm machinery sold by NACF.  Apart from being subsidized to the e:tent of
20% of price for tillers and about 7% for sprayers, these items art supplied
on credit. Credit for power tillers carries interest at 9X per an Lum and
is repayable in five years, including two years of grace. Land is taken as
secturity for such credit sales, in addition to the machine itself. Power
tillers are manufactured locally by two local firms with about 15% to 30%
of the component parts being imported. Sales of power tillers hav, in-
creased from 175 units in 1963 to 3,581 in 1970, and those of dust,rs/
sprayers, from 1,982 units in 1967 to about 24,000 in 1970.
27.       Marketing.  Marketing activities of NACF include (a) sal.s of
suchb general farm products as sweet potato, barley, soyabean and c rn;
(b) marketing of specialized cash crops, principally silk cocoonD <nd rape
seed; (c) sales to U.N. and Korean Military Forces; and (d) sales through
coopierative marketing centers. The last of these categories is by far the
most important and includes both sales of grains, fruits and vegetables
undertaken by the centers on their own through auctions and transattions
In grains undertaken on behalf of Government on an agency basis. larticulars
of agricultural produce marketed are as follows:
(in W million)
1968        1969       1970
Sales of general farm produce           2,899        3,132       2,237
Sales of cash crops                     7,070        9,036      9,498
Sales to military forces                1,110        1,351      2,808
Sales of cooperative marketing centers:
(a)  As agents of Government       5,091       8,415       9,586
(b)  Other                       21,715       53,426      53,023
(c)  Total                       26,806       61,841      62,609
In addition, NACF also markets farm 'sideline' products such as stiaw goods.
In some instances where general farm products and cash crops are m rketed,
NACF' extends credit to the buyerslfor periods not exceeding one ye-r,
charging a rate of interest of 6% for cocoons, 9% on other items u: ed in
expcrt preparation (for which special refinancing facilities are a ailable),
and 22X in other cases. Such credit sales are considered necessar for ex-
pediting sales but the collection of dues has proved difficult.  A counts
receivable in marketing business amounted to W 2,914 millioti for Ni.CF and
W 1,513 million for Kun cooperatives at the end of 1970; about 8% of the
totalt was overdue at the XAC? level.



ANNEX 3
Page 9
28.       Mutual Insurance.  NACF's activities include life insurance,
juvenile insurance (to finance education and marriage of children), and fire
and livestock insurance. New policies issued in 1970 numbered 79,234 for
endowment, 18,n32 for 'Juvenile insurance, 52,030 for livestock insurance
and 23,81n for fire Insurance. Sizeable surplus funds become available
from insurance for financing the other activities of NACF.
29.       Other Activities.  NACF operates a feed mixing plant.  Transport-
ation of agriculturat produce and farm supplies is another growing activity
of N}Arv. Further, NACF and Kun cooperatives together account for a substantial
pp"4 of the agricultural storage available in Korea.  NACF has also been
-+oviding loans and subsidies to Kun and Ri Dong cooperatives for construction
of warehouses. At the end of 1970, there were 5,307 cooperative warehouses,
in which 186.6 million bags of grain and 0.6 million tons of fertilizer
were stored. NACF also has a program for the construction of about 1,500
warehouses in the next five years at the Myon level (where the reorganized
primary cooperatives will have their offices), with loan assistance of about
US$6 million from USAID.
30.       Guidance.  One set of promotional activities of NACF is termed
'guidance'an4 covrs both cooperative education and management and an
extension-type of service relating to farming and livestock. The aim of
these efforts is to improve the management and working of primary cooperatives
by promoting a program of consolidation and operation of the mutual credit
scheme, and conduct courses and seminars for the education of members,
farmers and local leaders a well as staff of cooperatives (paras 11 and 12).
As part of farm guidance activities, projects are undertaken for the increased
production of various cash crops and certain exportable commodities. Working
closely with the Office for Rural Development (the Government organization
for research and extension), NACF seeks to assist farmers, Ri Dong and
special cooperatives to take up the cultivation of new crops and adoption
of new crop rotation patterns and of new production techniques. NACF provides
a substantial subsidy each year to Kun cooperatives to enable them to help
farmers participate in such programs. Similarly, it has been supporting
special projects for beef cow breeding and dairy farming.  Technical staff
is employed for these activities and provides farmers with technical guidance
as well as financial assistance. Inclusive of amounts spent on information
and cooperative education and expenses connected with programs for enabling
farmers to improve crop and livestock production, the expenditure on guidance
is a major charge on the revenues of NACF and partly accounts for its meagre
profits.
Resources
31.       The resources of NACF are made up of: (a) borrowings from Govern-
ment; (b) borrowings from the Bank of Korea; (c) deposits from the public
and from the Kun cooperatives; and (d) to a limited extent, share capital



ANN: X 3
Pag.  10
amd reserves (W 2,616 million at the end of 1970). The budgeta v funds
allocated to NACF have been increasing from year to year and the aggregate
outstanding dues to Government amounted, at the end of 197n, to W 56,658
million. Deposits including the surplus funds of Kun cooperati es, amounted
to W 52,277 million, and borrowings from the Bank of Korea to W 32,673
million.
32.       Budgetary funds made available for use as medium-term loans are
charged 5% by Government and lent to farmers at 9%. Government has also
provided NACF with amounts repayable in 30 years at interest of 2% for
making long-term loans to farmers' associations connected with Ihe management
of irrigation works. Further, NACF has received Government fun s at 2%
interest for credit sales of fertilizer and farm chemicals. Go'ernment has
also supplied resources to NACF for purchase of agricultural prnduce such as
sweet potatos, pepper and silk cocoons as part of a buffer stocl operation
designed to ensure stable prices for these commodities. Foreigi loans
Include funds received from the U.S. Government through the Govtrnment of
,torea to be on-lent as irrigation loans and a sum received dire tly from
the Commodity Credit Corporation of UTSA for being used in the cemmercial
business of NACF. The Bank of Korea has provided three lines oi credit
to MACF:  (a) W 30 billion at an interest rate of 2% for financing fertilizer
business: (b) W 9 billion at 5% for production credit to farmers; and (c)
about W 8 billion at 5.4% for financing exporters, especially ol silk.
33.       In mobilizing deposits, cooperatives command the advaitage of
having offices at more centers than the commercial banks and, ftrther,
have introduced certain special farmers' deposit schemes designid to tap
rural savings. Moreover, for attracting deposits, NACF and the Kln
cooperatives provide "savings promotion loans" which, in the ag regate,
may be up to one quarter of the value of deposits received.  As a result,
the deposits of NACF and Run cooperatives rose from W 20,948 mi:lion in
1966 to W 95,417 million at the end of 1970, of which about one quarter
represented farmers' deposits. The target is to raise total co perative
deposits from about W 100,000 million in 1971 to W 20n,000 million by the
end of 1976.
Financial Position
34.       It is difficult to assess NACF's financial position aid its
operating results precisely in view of the complexity of its futctions,
the magnitude and the subsidized nature of some of its operatiois, the close
integration of its activities with those of the Kun cooperatives and the
lack of adequate data to bring out the impact of these factors (n its
working (para 38). The available information (summarized in Talles 4, 5,
6 and 7) indicates that NACF's profits have been meager in relalion to the
volume of its credit and other operations which have been expan ing from
vear to year. This is partly because NACF incurs costs for agricultural
extension-tyre work and also subsdidizes Ri Dong and Kun cooperatives.



ANNEX 3
Page 1 1
Additionally, the subsidies promised to NACF by Government do not appear to
compensate NACF sufficiently for its costs and have not been promptly paid
to it in all cases.  Adtiuistrativo expenses have been rising from year to
year with expanding operations and coumon overheads are allocated to different
business sectors in relation to the number of etaff and the net income earned
by each business after allowing for expenditure other than such common
administrative costs. On this rough reckoning, the marketing and purchasing
businesses are running at a loss, while credit, insurance a,nd fertilizer
distribution have earnei profits (Table 7). The Kun cooperatives have also
been working at a low profit but have received subsidies from the NACF
(Table., 6 and 7).
3-1.      Because of the Liipited volume of profits, no substantial reserves
have been built up by NACF or the Kun cooperatives. There is provision
for (a) a legal reserve to which 10% of the net profit is to be carried
each year till it is equal to share capital; (b) a reserve for business
operation to which another 10% is carried (and which can be used in business);
and (c) a capital reserve to which are carried the profits from donated
fixed assets, revaluation of assets, and the like. It is the capital
reserve that is substantial, thanks to a revaluation of assets authorized
under special legislation enacted for this purpose in 1965.  The share
capital of NACF has remained small, as there is no link between the value
of shares held and the aount of borrowing   All borrowers are not required
to become shareholders and each member cooperative is required tp hold only
one share.  At the end of December 1970, the capital And reserves of NACF
and Kun cooperatives were as follows:
(in W million)
N,ACF               Kim Cooperatives
Paid-in capital               492                       1,018
Legal reserve                 355                         311
Reserve for business           82                         434
Capital reserve             1,645                       3,018
Undistributed profit           42                         164
2,616                      4,945
36.       Project cash flow is shown in Table 8.  Projection of the balance
sheet and inconpe and expenditure of the NACF is somewhat difficult. The
future dimensions and the distribution of its activities among different
businesses depend on its own policies and those of the Governxent of Korea
and the manner in which ad the extent to which Government provides subsidies
and seeks to hold prices of credit and inputs down.  Further, the Project
would form only a sma.l part of NACF's total operations.  Rough estimates
for only the credit section of NACF are, however, given in T4bles 9 and 10.
On present indications, assuming an increase of the interest rate on medium-
term and long-term agricultural loans, the stopping of Government subsidies



ANNEX I
Page 1!
and an expansion in credit operations, NACF's profits in credit buiiness may
incerease slightly but will still remain small in relation to the vdlume
of its operations.
Accounts
37.       In terms of the Agricultural Cooperative Law, NACF is retuired
to lorepare its business plan and budget for each fiscal year and o)tain the
approval of the concerned Minister of the Government not later that one
month prior to the commencement of the year. The law requires tha: the
Fed,eration shall settle all accounts within two months after the eid of
each fiscal year and report to the Minister in this regard after tie
Representative Meeting has approved the business report and the ba ance sheet,
The NACF's own by-laws stipulate that its accounting shall be in tie form
of comprehensive accounts and be divided into a general account ant a credit
account, both of which shall be "legally and actually independent" and that
transfers between these accounts are prohibited.  In pursuance of :hese
provisions and the increasing recognition of the need for a clear 'resentation
of 1MACF accounts, some steps have been taken or considered in this direction.
These include: (a) increased restrictions (in force from March 19'0) on the
provision of funds by the banking and credit section of the NACF f r financing
its commercial and other non-credit activities, (b) charging of a -ate of in-
terest of 24% by the credit section on advances to other sections, (c) monthly
distribution of administrative costs between credit and business (ion-credit)
secitors, (d) creation of a special office directly under the Presitent of
NACF for evaluating the manner in which the administrative expense  are
distributed, and (e) establishment of targets for net surpluses fo- each
comiercial sector of NACF.
38.       Notwithstanding the statutory provisions and the steps p-oposed or
taken, much remains to be done for ensuring a clear presentation o  NACF
operations. The following are some of the factors contributing to the present
lack of clarity:
(a) Some of the proposed measures such as monthly
distribution of administrative expenses are not yet
in force;
(b)  The NACF undertakes various operations on behalf, or at
the behest, of Government. In some instances, the provi-
sion for compensating the cost or loss to NACF is inadeqiate
and the payments due to NACF on such accounts are someti es
delayed. The accounts do not fully bring out these aspe:ts
of NACF's activities;



ANNEX 3
Page 13
(c) It is not easy to ascertain the financial position
of each business sector or how profitably it is
being operated. Though various monthly statements are
prepared, the picture is not clear enough to provide a
basis for management decisions on pricing and
inventories"
(d) The allocation of administrative costs (including
guidance expenditure) among different businesses is now
based partly on the distribution of staff and partly
on the estimated gross income of individual sections.
While this is a first step, further refinement is
necessary on the basis of cost accounting principles.
A detailed analysis is made only once a year and the
authoritative break-up of the 1970 data for this purpose
was not ready by June 1971; and
(e) Accounts receivable in the business sector are not clearly
evaluated to show the overdues and uncollectible amounts.
39.       Though the bookkeeping of NACF is satisfactory, the accounting
system needs to be improved so as to enable its own management, as well
as its creditors, to obtain a clearer picture, especially of the profitability
of each of its business sectors. This would be particularly important in
the short run for enabling the management to take decisions on measures
for correctinR deficits and losses in individual sectors and, in the long
run, for determining the extent to which and the manner in which credit and
other activities of NACF might be progressively separated. Reform of the ac-
counting system assumes further urgency in view of NACF's intention of
using the electronic data processing system for the maintenance of its
accounts. As the operations of NACF have rapidly expanded, there is a need
to ensure that its organization and financial and accounting arrangements
are suitably streamlined to meet the requirements of efficient management.
As this can be done only on the basis of a careful examination of the present
system, a firm of management consultants would be asked to study the existing
zccounting system of NACF and suggest measures of improvement and help in
the implementation of the recommended steps, as set out in the terms of
reference given in Annex 7.
Audit
4n).      AS stipulated in the Agricultural Cooperative Law, the General
Assembly of NTACF elects two auditors to serve for a term of two years;
of these, the standing auditor is reqtiired to have "an abundant knowledge
nnd experience" of his duties and functions. The auditors' duties have
heen defined as those of "inspecting and auditing the business and status
of assets of the 1'ederation." The law also provides for the exercise of
supervisorv functions vis-a-vis NACF by the competent Minister (who could



ANNEX 3
Page 14
be the Minister of Finance or Minister for Agriculture, depending on whether
the credit aspect of the working of NACF is being considered or some other
aspect). The minister can also have the Superintendent of Banks, Bank of
Rorea, inspect and audit the Federation and can delegate part of his super-
visory authority to Provincial Governors or the President of NACF. Further,
in case a cooperative or the NACF receives subsidies or loans from Govern-
mient, it is subject to audit, insofar as the use of Government funds is
concerned, by the Board of Inspection of the Government of Korea. The Bank
of Korea also undertakes an annual statutory inspection of the NACF, looking
mtainly into the credit and banking aspects of its working. Finally, NACF
and its branches are also subject to investigations by the National Assembly
Investigation Committees of Finance and of Agriculture and Forestry. Though
t.here are, thus, several agencies involved in supervision and inspection
of the NAC?, none of tbm  is conerTned with all the aspects of its opera-
tions. Further, its only comprehensive audit is that conducted by the two
atuditors elected by the-General Assembly, with the assistance of nine
assistant auditors who are on the NACF staff.

1/ Inclusive of loans under proposed IDA project.
Note:  Resource projections are roughly based on NACF estimates, which assume
(a) growth in its own deposits on past actual average and that of Kun cooperatives
on their similar estimates, (b) increase in borrowings from Government of Korea
on national five year plan data, and (c) increase in borrowings from bank of Korea
on its projections. Increased share capital is estimated on the basis of progres-
sive linking of shareholding and borrowings. Aggregate loan portfolio estimates
are based on NACF projections. For their break-up, annual increase is assumed at
i) 207% in 1972 and 1973 and 15% in 1974 and 1975 for short-term agricultural loans,

KOREA
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Draft Policy Statement for Operations on the Special Fund for
Medium- and Long-term Agricultural Loans to be established in NACF
Resources in the Fund
A.        The resources in the Fund would consist of:  (a) a sum of W 1,400
million lent to NACF by Government of Korea, at an interest rate of 7%
(b) the proceeds of IDA credit to be passed on by Government to NACF in
the same manner; and (c) amounts received by way of repayment of loans made
from the resources in the Fund.
Use of Resources in the Fund
2.        The resources in the Special Fund for medium- and long-term loans
for agricultural purposes (to be referred to hereinafter as the Fund) shall
be used by NACF for making medium-term and long-term loans for financing the
development of orchards, sericulture, mushroom, poultry and swine.
3.        All recoveries made in respect of loans disbursed from this Fund
shall be credited to the Fund and used for further lending for approved pur-
poses. The interest paid on resources in the Fund and that earned on the
loans shall be carried to the profit and loss account of the credit sections
of NACF and Kun cooperatives.
4.        NACF shall maintain separate accounts of operations on the Fund.
Eligible Purposes
5.        The list of purposes for which loans may be made may be expanded
to cover other purposes similar to those specified in paragraph 1 above
after the disbursements under the IDA Project are completed.
Eligible Categories of Borrowers
6.        Loans from the Fund may be made to individual cultivators or
cooperatives or agricultural associations but the borrowing unit or
enterprise should be financially viable and its projected operations
should be consistent with the national economic development priorities.
Size of Loans
7.        No single loan from the Fund shall ordinarily exceed W 50 million.
A loan to any beneficiary shall not exceed 80% of the cost of the investment
proposed by him.



ANtEX 5
Pare 2
Security
8.        NACF or Kun cooperatives should obtain adequate secur:ty on loans
made. However, apart from security considerations, loan reques:s should be
evaluated in terms of the projected incremental returns from th! additional
investment to be financed and the resulting repaylng capacity.
Lending Principles
9.        NACF and Kun cooperatives should aim at financing frol the Fund
only sound projects that are found, on careful appraisal (incluling field
investigation), to be technically feasible, financially viable and can
be expected to be satisfactorily managed.
10.       The period of repayment of loans shall be based on th. life of
the asset or development financed and on realistic projections *f the
borrower' s cash flow.
11.       Loans from the Fund would not ordinarily be used for  efinancing
investments already financed from other sources.
12.       While providing medium-term and long-term agricultura: loans for
financing Investment expenditures, NACF and Kun cooperatives wi:l finance
working capital requirements of the borrower from resources oth*r than
those in the Fund or ensure that adequate funds are otherwise alailable to
ithe borrower for the purpose.
Recovers of Loans
113.      Records shall be kept to determine the loan instalmenis falling
due for repayment and to watch the progress of collections.
14.       A standard procedure and principles will be adopted fcr extending
the period of repayment of loans.
Rate of Interest
15.       The interest rate and any other fees charged to the bcrrowers of
loans from the Fund should be fixed from time to time in the light of the
current market rate; the cost of the resources to NACF and Kun cooperatives,
and their operating expenses, including adequate provision for lad debts,
depreciation and taxes.
Channel for Lending
16.       Loans from the Fund shall be advanced to borrowers, as far as
possible, through Kun cooperatives, provided, however, that eacf such
cooperative shall satisfy the following conditions:
(a) the real value of the assets of the Ktm cooperative is sufficient
to meet its outside liabilities and that no part of its capital and
reserves has been eroded;



ANNEX 5
Page 3
(b) the overdues of the Kun cooperative, at the end of the preceding
financial year, de not exceed 10% of its outstanding loans;
(c) the Kun cooperative has adopted a standard procedure and
principles for extending the period of repayment of the loans;
and
(d)  the management of the Kun cooperative is satisfactory and its
appraisal staff have been suitably trained for Project lending
and supervision or will be so trained within 12 months from
the date of the credit.
17.       In instances where, for any reason, a loan from the Fund cannot be
advanced to a borrower through a Kun cooperative, NACF shall make a direct
loan to hiim and use the Kun cooperative, where necessary, as an agency for
lending, on the payment of a commission.!

Production
1.        Area of fruit orchards represented only about 2% of ROK's cultivated
1,4nd in 1969, but accounted for about 3.1% of the agricultural GDP. Area and
production of fruits have increased markedly:
1965                         1969
Area    Production  Yield   Area    Production  Yield
'000 ha  '000 tons   kg/ha  '000 ha  '000 tons   Kg/ha

Grapes                  3.5       18.6    5,310      5.2        37.4     7,190
Pears                   5.2       39.5    7,600      6.2        46.0     7,420
Peaches                10.6       54.3    5,120    11.6         68.3     5,890
Other Stone Fruit       1.3        6.2       -       2.9         9.0       -
Other Fruits            3.3       24.6       -       9.0        36.9       -
Total            42.9       310.0      -       55.7      417.0        -
2.        Regional distribution of production by type of fruit shows
concentration of: (a) apples in North Kyongsang and South Chungchong; (b)
grapes in Kyonggido-Seoul; (c) pears in Kyonggido and South Chungehong; and
(d) peaches and other stone fruits in South Chungchong, Kyonggido and North
Kyongsang.
Production Methods
3.        Sharper gains in production were achieved by expanding cropped
areas rather than by increasing yields. National average yields are low;
however, an estimated 40% of trees are young in non-bearing stage. In areas
selected for the proposed Project, yields as high as 25 tons per ha (apples
and pears) and 20 tons per ha (peaches, other stone fruits and grapes) are
reported. Generally, standards in production techniques and management are
good, although the reinforcement of some agronomic techniques such as the
use of improved planting material (especially pears); more discipline in
population density (especially in grapes), irrigation and drainage; and
more careful selection of land (avoiding proximity to wet lands) could lead
to gains in productivity. Sizeable gains in production and productivity,
which need to be extended, are being achieved by planting improved



ANNE. 8
Page 2
varieties on bench-terraced uplands, avoiding competition with the scarce
paddy-land; reinforcing crop diversification endeavors; and bringing into
production areas not otherwise utilized.
institutional Support
4.        Government, private enterprise, bilateral and internat onal organi-
zations have supported fruit development. In addition to the Of ice of
IRural Development (ORD), the main official experimental station it Suwon,
Government supports research institutes and rural guidance agenc.es at
national, provincial and county levels, including the cooperativis; all of
them are providing supporting services to fruit production. Priwate enter-
prise is mostly engaged in production and multiplication of saplings and
improved seedlings. Bilateral and international agencies have p -ovided as-
sistance through surveys, demonstrations and loans.
5.        Growers, working with the National Agricultural Cooperitive
Federation, have organized about 60 horticultural cooperatives i- major
fruit-growing regions to support fruit and vegetable development. These
cooperatives publish and distribute technical and economic inforriation;
organize the feedback of growers' problems to technical and admiuistrative
a,uthorities; orient, guide and encourage production research; ani represent
the interests of regional producers or of the entire industry.
Narketing
6.        Marketing and processing services are provided to grow -rs by (a)
private traders, (b) companies, (c) groups of farmers who own and operate
cold storage and/or processing installations, and (d) horticultu al coopera-
tives.
7.        The greater part (60%) of the total fruit output (60%) is sold through
private traders and retailed in urban markets. In many cases friit merchants
make cash advances to growers before harvest and purchase the cr p on the
trees. Fruit sold through cooperatives is marketed locally or tarough the
NACF marketing centers established in five main cities (Seoul, P isan, Taegu,
Kyongju and Taejou). At these centers, fruit and vegetables are sold by
auaction to accredited merchants, and NACF charges a commission o  7%, includ-
ing a 5% service charge, 1% towards dealers' share capital and a 1% credited
to the growers' share capital. A sketch of the marketing channels is shown
bealow:

In general, the processing units are small enterprises, with limited
equipment, but able to adapt to a range of different fruits and vegetables,
including mushrooms. A larger plant, the Hankuk Suntory Ltd., in partnership
with the Suntory Liquor Compasy of Japan, has been established to expand
production of wine, brandy and other grape products. The winery processed
800 tons in 1969.
9.        Market prospects for the incremental Project output of the four
fruits are considered favorable and this was one of the principal reasons
they were selected for special financing arrangements under the Project.
Such output would be disposed of predominantly in domestic markets, which
are showing a strong growth with the rising standard of living in Korea.
Its magnitude would be marginal in terms of the projected national consump-
tion at the time of full development (Table 1):
Apples    Grapes    Peaches    Pears
4%       15%        9%         11%
The higher level of grapes in the total demand projections conforms with
Government policy to expand rapidly the consumption of grape wine in place
of rice wine in order to save more rice for food.  On the other hand, the
existing domestic demand for grape products is substantial already. The
income elasticity of demand for grapes was 0.66% in 1968.

10.       The sustained and steady increase of fruit prices, compared to the
price of other farm products, confirms the favorable market prospects
(Table 2; and Annex 1, Table 3) and the attractiveness of orchard exploita-
tion. However, there is a need for more farm storage and central cold
storage in order to spread supplies over a longer period and stabilize prices.
At: the present time, growers with adequate storage can obtain almost twice
the post-harvest price by keeping fruit for sale in the spring.
Ill.      Fruit exports, mainly apples, pears, and peaches, are still small.
They began in 1964 and have reached annual levels of about US$600,000. Ex-
port markets are the Philippines, Taiwan, and other Asian countries. Govern-
ment authorities believe that there are good prospects for expanding fruit
exports to these countries.

Sericulture
1.        Some 3,000 years ago sericulture was introduced to Korea from
China and today it ranks fourth among the world producers, after Japan,
Mainland China and USSR, and first among silk-exporting countries. Produc-
tion of silk involves cultivation of mulberry trees and raising of silk
worms. About 100,000 ha of mulberry trees and 500,000 farm households are
currently engaged in this activity, producing annually approximately 20,000
tons of cocoons, valued at about W 8 billion and generating exports of about
US$30 million worth of raw silk. Cocoon production in 1969 was about four
times higher than in 1962 and present export earnings represent about 20% of
total agricultural exports. Results achieved during the First and Second
Five-Year Plan periods are summarized as follows:

2.        Sericulturists are scattered over the valleys of the country but
the industry is concentrated mainly where there is a large supply of cheap
labor, mostly women, old persons and children. An important development
of about 3,000 ha, is progressing well under the auspices of the Honam Silk
Industry Company, which is financed by IFC through the Agriculture and
Fishery Development Corporation (AFDC).
Production Methods
3.        Mulberry Trees (Morus Alba).  Two-year improved mulberry tree
seedlings, produced by Government and more than 900 private nurseries, are
used to plant fields from which leaves are harvested to feed silkworms.
Mrulberry trees produce economically from the third through the 15th year.
Average yields and carrying capacity are:

4.        Silkworms (Bombyx Mori).  Ten-gram boxes, each containing about
20,000 eggs produced by about 60 companies, are put to hatch in heated
sheds protected from non-desirable environmental factors. Fresh mulberry
leaves are collected in spring and autumn, several times per day, to feed
the voracious silkworms. During these two rearing and cocoon production
seasons, a large individual enterprise may hatch about half a billion eggs
per season and produce about 750 kg of cocoon per year, or the equivalent of
100 kg of raw silk. On the average, an individual enterprise hatches about
50,000 eggs each per season. Cocoons are harvested in spring and autumn and
sold to some 50 silk reeling companies.
Institutional Support
5,.       Both Government and private sector associations support the seri-
culture industry. Government conducts research at the Suwan sericulture
experiment station and is responsible for quality control of mulberry tree
sa;plings, silk worm eggs, cocoon grading and silk conditioning and testing.
NACF operates a nationwide network of cocoon collection stations and extends
credit to cocoon processors (reeling factories). Farmers, mulberry tree
nurseries, silk worm egg producers, silk reeling factories and silk exporters
receive technical and other trade-related backstopping from their respective
associations.
Marketing
6.        Cocoon marketing is regulated by Government.  Except for about
one-tenth of the total output, which is retained by producers for hand reel-
ing, the production is purchased by NACF, the only authorized buyer of
cocoons. The crop is then resold to licensed silk reeling factories 1/
according to allocations made by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry
(MKAF) and the Provincial governments. All silk reeling mills are owned by
Korean companies, the largest of which, Hongu Raw Silk Co. Ltd., handles
about one-third of the national crop and operates about 15 mills.
7.        In 1970, Korea had 48 operating filatures, employing about 12,000
workers for 250 days per year and producing about 3,000 m tons of raw silk.
I/   New capacity can be established only by Government license.  Location,
number and capacity of filatures are related to mulberry area within a
given province.



ANNEX 9
Page 3
IFC provided US$1.7 million in 1969 to finance a filature mill to produce
250 tons of raw silk annually. It also supplied financial and technical as-
sistance to farmers to develop mulberry plantations and build cocoon-rnising
facilities under the overall ranagement of Honam Silk Industry Co. This
project will reach its full capacity in 1975 and cover 3,000 ha, involving
about 7,500 households.
8.        Selling prices of cocoons to NACF are fixed annually by the
Government Price Deliberation Committee, with price differentials between
quality grades and between "spring" and "autumn" crop (Table 1).  NACF
receives a comnission of W 10 per kg for its services. Farmers are paid
cash on delivery, but NACF sells on credit to the reeling factories, and
rayment, with interest at 6%, falls due when the reeled silk is sold.  The
set prices at which the silk reeling companies procure their supplies of
cocoons are related to target export prices for silk, allowing for normal
costs and a fair margin of profit. If the actual export price exceeds the
established target figure, 50% of the excess is paid into a silk price
stabilization fund; if the price falls short of the target figure, 50% of
the shortfall is subsidized out of the stabilization fund. The actual export
prfces refer to those of the Yokohama silk exchange.  The rising trend of ex-
port prices in recent years has made it possible to maintain a comfortable
balance in the stabi4ozation fund, while granting farmers progressive increases
in cocoon prices. Cocoon prices increased by 5.5% per year from 1965 to 1970,
while the export price of raw silk increased by 6.5% a year, qnd the Yokohama
prices by 9.0% at the same time.

1970          17.40          22.38
9.        A large part of reeling mills' output is exported through the
Korean Raw Silk Exporters' Association although more and more is being
exported directly by licenged silk mills, which try to establish their own
brand name. About 90% of the national silk production of Korea is exported
each year, placing it first among exporting countries since 1967 (Table 2).
In 1970, 1,978 m tons of raw silk, representing US$34.4 million, were
exported out of a total production of 3,027 m tons. Since 1965, Korean
exports increased, by about 28% per year while production increased by
only 22% (Table 3).
10.       The pattern of world trade in silk has radically altered in recent
years, because Japan, formerly the world's largest exporter, has now become
a net importer. Japan produces and consumes as much raw silk as all other



ANNEX 9
Page 4
countries in the world combined but, despite official efforts to stimulate
sericulture, Japan's output has been stagnant at an average of 19,000 to
20,000 tons per year. Shortage of labor and rising wage levels are now
expected to preclude any significant expansion in the future. The second
factor that altered the world supply is that, in some high income countries,
which were among the main silk producers, production was drastically curtailed,
as in Italy, or completely abandoned, as in France, because of the high labor
costs.
11.       The world demand, after a short period of decrease because of
fascination with synthetic fibers, has shown a constant increase since 1965
(Table 2), particularly in Japan where the kimono, as a fornal dress, is
now being worn side by side with western dresses. In Western Europe there
is also an apparent tendency to use more silk in high quality and luxury
fashions and it is generally expected that world consumption will continue
to expand. FAO has estimated that the gradual upward trend will average 4%
a year. Mainland China remains, however, the most important unknown, and
its role in future trade of raw silk is open to speculation.
12.       A projection of raw silk production under present conditions
indicates that the incremental production due to the project would constitute,
at full development, only 0.4% of the world production and probably 2% of
Korean production.

11   The Korean production increased at an annual rate of 22% during the last
10 years and it is assumed that it will increase by 15% during the period
1969-70, as projected by the Third Plan.

Mushrooms
Production
1.        Mushroom prqduction is in two main categories:  wild mushrooms and
.-tivated ushrooms.  Only very small quantities of wild mushrooms, which
grow in various parts of the world, find their way to the markets or to
the canning industry. The United States is the largest producer of cultivated
mushrooms, followed by France, China (Taiw#n), the United Kingdom, and the
NetherXands.  There are two methods of cultivation and their use varies
between countries.  In France, mushrooms are grown mainly in caves using
both "tray" (70%) and "bed" systems; 1/ in the United States the "tray"
8ystew, qf ten in air-cQd_tio ed housing, is used am,st entirely, while
in China (Taiwan), (he "baed"ystem i      m simple rice sheds i8 the most popular.
2.        Dring the 1960's, production increased steadily in the major
producitg cQ4fntriel (Table 1) but in varying degrees.  In the EEC, France
more than 4oubled output, reaching 64,000 m ton; the Netherlands increased
its output by 10 times to 26,900 m to e.  Tblp drastic increase in production
in the EEC was spurred by a large rise in conpumer demand for mushrooms,
especially in Permawny (Fj..G.).  United Kingdom production increased steadily
and the inited States, the largept produ,cer, almQst doubled ou.tput from
49,000 m tons in 1960/61 to bout 94,000 uetrc tons in 1970/71.  However,
the most si*Wficant 4yelopient has been the upsurge of cultivated mushroom
production n China (Taiwn).  Aided by good growing conditions, production
skills, and achept a#c of the conned produce in export markets, output rose
from~i nil is the  lrly 1960's to over 56,000 m tos in 1970/71.
3.        Production in the RqpublUc of Korea began in 1964/65, and recently
the Government  as. begun assisting cultivatora in expanding production and
setting up m,odern proce*sing facilities for the "chwpignon" type, grown for
canning.  Production, which in 1969/70 reached a total of 6,000 m tons,
had grown ap follows:

4.        In Korea, mushrooms are produced all over the country.  Cultivation
houses are grouped in batteries, each battery composed of 20 to 22 houses;
each house, on average, contains about two-thirds of one ha (2,000 pyong2 of
cultzivated beds arranged in levels. Production is both capital (US$15/rn)
and labor (about 2 man-days/m2) intensive. More efficient methods of product-
ion, developed by the Inatitute of Plant Environment of ORD (founded in 1967),
have enabled the industry to itcrease yields and reduce the area cultivated.
From 1967 to date, yields increased about four times, area was reduced
by half, and-production increased about 2-1/2 times.  At the ssae time,
opportunities have by no means been exhausted for improving production
techniques And management. Research could play an important role in
helping to cut investments by improving methods of controlling humidity,
temperature and pollution, etc., and, to a lesser extent, by improving
growing methods--mushrooms are sensitive to nutrient levels, moisture,
phytosanitary conditions.
Imports and Exports
5.        Mushrooms are traded internationally mainly in the form of canned
products. The volume of eanned uiushrooms entering the main importing
countries, representing over 90% of world imports, is summarized in Table
2. Germany (F.R.G.) is the leading world importer of canned Aushrooms,
followed by the United States and, a distant third, Canada. Total imports 1/
increased at a fantastic rate, from 4,000 m tons in 1960 to about 52,000 m
tons in 1970.
6.        The remarkable increase in canned mushroom imports into Germany
(F.R.G.) was stimulated by the elimination of quotas in 1959. China (Taiwan)
beneEited most, and by 1963 had gained a market share of almost 80%,
through sales at prices of up to a third below competitors (Table 3). This
price advantage has since levelled off and Taiwan's share of the German
market has fallen, although total shipments have increased and imports
1/   In Tables 2, 4 and 5 quantities are expressed in terms of drained weight,
i.e., the net weight of the mushrooms in the can. Gross weight includes
the weight of the cartons, tin can and the bDrine in which the mushrooms
are kept inside the can. EEC countries and Canada record imports of
cann d mushrooms in gross weight equivalent while the United States
records them in drained weight equivalent.



ANNEX 10
Page 3
from other EEC countries have taken the spotlight. A Common External
Tariff for canned mushrooms was established in 1960, amounting to 23% ad
valorem, and there has been a continuous reduction since then of duties on
intra-EEC trade.
7.        The United States is the second largest importer of canned
mushrooms in the world. Until the early 1960's, France was the major
supplier, but quantities were small (Table 4). U.S. imports then began
to grow rapidly, mostly due to imports from Taiwan, which, by 1970, supplied
almost 90% of the total. The Republic of Korea supplied 292 m tons in 1969.
Canned mushroom imports are charged a specific duty of 3.2 cents per pound
(drained weight) plus 10% ad valorem, the total charge averaging 15.3% in
pX>70.
8.        Export data are shown in Table 5.  China (Taiwan), the Netherlands,
and France commanded over 90% of the world trade. Major destinations were
Germany (F.R.C.) (55%), U.S.A. (24%), and Canada (6%). In 1965 Korea exported
only 14 m tons (drained weight); in 1969, 1,224 m tons, and in 1970, 2,425 m
tons. Germany (F.R.G.) is also the largest market for Korean products (over
60% in 1970), followed by Switzerland and the United States.
Prices
9.        Export prices for the Taiwan product constitute the leading world
market index. Since late 1963, export sales of Chinese canned mushrooms have
been made on the basis of a uniform price schedule, 1/ established yearly by
the Taiwan Mushroom Packers United Export Corporation (which is also
charged with export promotion). Prices increased moderately every year--
excepting 1969--until 1970. In 1971, due to the strong demand on the
export market, Taiwan prices were increased by about 10%. Prices for
French and Dutch canned mushrooms in the German (FRG) market have followed
the same trend.  Republic of Korea has been selling at slightly higher prices
than China (Taiwan), but the quantities involved have been minor. On the
United States market, where China (Taiwan) has virtually a monopoly
position, import unit values of Chinese canned mushrooms in 1969 were slightly
above those of the early 1960's.
Outlook
10.       Projection of future import demand of canned mushrooms for the
major importing countries is hazardous, A regression analysis for 1960-71
covering the United States and Germany (FRG), clearly indicates high income
elasticities of demand for mushrooms, but technical considerations-
especially the rapid growth of demand in both countries, and especially in
Germany where consumption per capita has increased tenfold in 12 years --
make the use of the computed coefficient unreliable for projection purposes.
1/   Until 1969, applicable only to sales outside of Europe.



ANNEX 10

11.       Alternatively, for the three largest importers (Germany, the United
States and Canada), it has been assumed that per capita consumption of
mushrooms in 1980 will increase to 1.50 kg, 0.80 kg, and 0.90 kg respectively
(Table 6). The level of 1.50 Kg for Genmany (F.R.G.) has been assumed to
bie the saturation level at which per capita consumption of mushrooms will
stabilize during the 1970's. This could be a conservative estimate, but
the increased availability of other types of vegetables in canned form and
of fresh vegetables throughout the year should diminish the rate of growth
in mushroom consumption in Germany (F.R.G.) The levels for the United
States and Canada assume an increase in line with recent trends in both
countries. Table 6 shows estimates of past and future supply and consumption
of mushrooms in the three main importing markets.
12.       Production of mushrooms resulting from the Project will amount to
3,234 tons (fresh basis) by 1980. It is assumed that the whole production
will be processed into canned mushrooms for exports. Export availability
from the Project by 1980 will amount to 2,100 m tons in terms of drained
weight, representing 1.7Z of the estimated world import demand of canned
muishrooms by that time. No difficulties are envisaged in exporting those
quantities, considering the dynamic growth of the mushroom market.
13.       On the price side, the large expansion of world mushroom
production in recent years has not lowered export prices. Competition
among suppliers is expected to increase, considering the potential for
increasing yields in China (Taiwan) and the growing importance of new
exporters such as the Republic of Korea 1/ and China (Mainland).  There
will be rapid growth of demand as well, and prices are expected to remain
in the 1970's at about the same level experienced in recent years.
1/   The Mission has estimated that total Korean production by 1980
(including the Project) will amount to 15,000 m tons of fresh mushrooms
(9,750 m tons, drained weight). This amount would represent 12.6% of
the estimated world import demand for canned mushrooms by 1980.

16.       ROK's national herd in 1969 was estimated at 1.2 million beef
ciattlen 19,000 dairy cows, 1.3 million hogs and 100,000 sheep and goats.
Its management regime relies on utilization of wild grasses during the
-arr, season and cereal straw, some silage and cooked food during the cold
season. National flock of fowl (chicken, ducks, turkeys and geese) was
estimated at 23 million.
2.        Total number of farm households for livestock and poultry breeding
in 1969 was estimated at about 4.2 million. The Ministry of Agriculture and
Forestry (MAF) estimates that, from 1965 to 1969, the size of herds and
flocks increased per farm household, while total numbers of farm households
and livestock decreased (except poultry). MAF data are:

Marketing
4.        The consumption of meat and eggs is extremely low in Korea,
despite an increase in poultry of nearly 18% per year since 1965.  Production
not consumed on farms reaches the urban consumer through two main channels:
(a) NACF's 94 livestock cooperatives, which handle about 20% of the total
marketed output; and (b) private channels, which handle the remaining 80%.
The livestock sub-project would involve eight provinces and 17 livestock
cooperatives. The latter were selected because of: (a) the good results
they achieved under NACF's current livestock development program; (b)
the existence of large consumer centers in the area, such as main cities,
industrial centers, armed forces camps, and such; and (c) existence also
of feed mills and other livestock facilities necessary for the promotion
of livestock production.
5.        With other factors, the demand expressed by a high income
elasticity has played an important role in the large increase of prices
since 1965. The prices increased each year by 10% for poultry products and
12.7% for pork; their progression was as follows:
1965     1966      1967      1968      1969      1970

6.        The Project, which would finance 300 egg farms, 200 broiler
farms, and 250 swine farms, would have a limited impact on the projected
national consumption when it would have reached its full development stage.
As indicated below, the projected incremental production as proportion
of national consumption at the Project's full development year would be
about 4% for eggs; 8% for broilers; and 0.6% for pork.

7.        These projections take into account the increase of population, the
lnarease of income per capita and income elasticities of demand for selected
commodities. Except for pork, the rates obtained by this method are much
more conservative than those obtained from the 1965-80 trend projection
(Table 1).

increase rate of income per capita (C=0.07): and income elasticity of demand for
selected commodities (N=0.78 for eggs; N=1.23 for broilers; N=0.60 for swine). These
coefficients are estimated by Korean Economic Planning Bureau (EPB) and show the
following rate of increase in demand:

AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
1.        The economic rates of return from the project to the economy have
been calculated separately for each group of farm models, as shown in the
attached appendixes: (1) Fruit, (2) Sericulture, (3) Mushrooms, and (4)
Poultry and Swine.
2.        Domestic current prices were used for all inputs and outputs.
However, various sensitivity tests, increasing the costs by 10% or decressi%P
the benefits by 10%, were applied. The use of current domestic prices Is
justified for each group of commodities as follows:
(a) Fruit, poultry and pork are mainly for domestic
consumption; only small quantities of apples are
currently exported. 1/ Korean domestic prices are
about 50% lower than FOB Japan export prices for
fruit and eggs and CIF Japan import prices for
poultry, meat and pork. The use of domestic prices
for these commodities in economic return calculations
is therefore on the conservative side.
(b) For cocoon and mushroom, current Korean prices are slightly
lower than those prevailing in other competitor countries,
such as Japan and Taiwan.
3.        Tax revenue consists of duties on imported goods for investment or
operation. The duties are as follows:
Value of
Imported Goods as
% of Investment and
Operating Costs           Rate of Duty
Fruit (Appendix 13-1)                  15%                      35%
Sericulture (Appendix 13-2)            14%                      15%
Mushroom (Appendix 13-2)               19%                      40%
Poultry and Swine - Investment         18%                      35%
- Feed              65%                     20%
(Appendix 13-3)
1/   This was confirmed by the Trade Policies and Export Projections
Division of IBRD's Economic Department.

4.        Subsidies are added to costs where appropriate, viz., for saplings,
spawn, fertilizer, pesticides, lime, power tillers and power sprayers (details
in Farm Models 1(a), 1(b), 1(c), 1(d), 2 and 3).
5.        Salvage values proportional to unexpired asset life have been
included in the mushroom farm model.
6.        The overall economic rate of return of the project is 37%.
(Appendices 13-1, 13-2 and 13-3) 1/.  The high rate of return shown in poultry
and swine farm models is due to the relatively high level of tax revenue
without any counterpart of subsidies from the economy and also to the
attractive prices for these products in Korea. It should be noted also
that, because of their nature, poultry and swine operations are very
sensitive to disease and mismanagement.
December 10, 1971
1/   When weighed according to the relative share of each farm in project
cost, the average financial rate of return is about 32%.
