PAKISTAN
FIFTH EDUCATION (VOCATIONAL TRAINING) PROJECT
I. MANPOWER IMPLICATIONS OF THE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
Economic Background
1.01      Over the past three years, Pakistan has witnessed a significant
economic recovery: GDP growth during FY78 and FY79 averaged over 6% p.a. and
a similar rate of growth is likely to be attained in FY80. This growth has
been accompanied by a recovery in agricultural and industrial production well
above the rate of population growth currently averaging 3% p.a., and by a
rapid growth in exports. Exports increased in real terms by 11% in FY78 and
by 20% in FY79; during FY80 a further 44% increase in current prices over the
FY79 level is expected. Value added in agriculture may rise by 6-7% this year
following increases of 2.5% in FY78 and 4.2% in FY79, and in industry by 4-5%
this year following 9.2% growth in FY78 and 4.2% in FY79. This performance
contrasts markedly with the economic stagnation of the early and mid 1970s,
when the growth of GDP averaged only 3-4% and goods production 1.1% p.a., and
export growth was negligible.
1.02      The recovery in the economy since 1977 has been aided by several
factors, including favorable weather, improved foreign demand for Pakistan's
exports and higher domestic demand associated with better crops, rising rural
incomes and workers' remittances from the Middle East. Various policy changes
introduced by the Government have also contributed to the recovery.
1.03      In the industrial sector, the policies pursued in the early and mid
1970s of extensive nationalizations, tight restrictions on the private sector,
and rapid expansion of the public sector to spearhead industrial investment
and growth have been gradually reversed. Most agricultural processing and
some industrial units have been denationalized; constitutional safeguards have
been provided to private industry against further arbitrary Government acqui-
sitions; and the areas open to the private sector have been widened. A wide
range of incentives including tax holidays, excise and import duty concessions,
easier access to imported raw materials, concessionary credit and income tax
provisions, and direct cash rebates have been granted to encourage private
investment and exports. The Government has also embarked on the difficult
process of reforming the public sector which has been plagued by low effi-
ciency and low profits.
1.04      Despite the recent improvements in output and exports, and in the
overall management of the economy, financial difficulties persist. To a
considerable extent these difficulties reflect continuing pressures on re-
sources, despite rapid output growth and the Government's efforts to restrain
public investment. These pressures have led to substantial imbalances between
savings and investments and between exports and imports--imbalances which have
manifested themselves in sizable budgetary and balance of payments deficits.
The balance of payments presents the Pakistan Government with its most intrac-
table problem. With imports roughly double the level of exports, exports must
rise at a substantially faster rate than imports simply to prevent a worsening
in the sizable foreign trade deficit - a task made even more difficult by the
sharp increase in the petroleum import bill. The current account deficit is



- 2-
expected to remain around US$1,010 million or 4% of GNP in FY198Q. The
Government intends to meet this problem, by mounting a major effort of import
substitution in foodgrains, fertilizers and energy. It also intends to ex-
pand manufacturing particularly in industries in which Pakistan has a compara-
tive advantage.
1.05      Industry contributes about 15% of GDP and during much of the 1950s
and 1960s provided a major stimulus to growth. Growth rates in manufacturing
production, though recently better, remain well below those attained in the
1960s. The textile industry, in particular, which accounts for about 40% of
the value added in large-scale industry, has suffered from problems of ineffi-
ciency, excess capacity and a lack of competitiveness in foreign markets, while
manufacturing growth generally has been affected by the unsatisfactory perfor-
mance of public sector enterprises. To maintain the momentum of the past
three years (para 1.01) the industrial sector will require, in addition to
inputs of capital and technology, an increase in labor productivity and an
increased supply of skilled manpower.
Manpower Demand and Supply
1.06      At present there is a shortage of skilled and semi-skilled labor,
largely because opportunities for training and upgrading are limited, and the
continuing exodus of skilled workers to the Middle East. The shortage of
skilled workers in the public sector is aggravated further because wages are
lower relative to private industry. It will therefore be necessary to
increase the supply and upgrade the quality of skilled and semi-skilled labor
to support the expansion and diversification of industry so necessary to
Pakistan's industrial development plans (para 1.03), and thereby contribute
in overcoming its persistent balance of payment problems.
1.07      Annual estimates for new employment in the formal sector for the
period 1978 - 1985 are provided in Table 1.1. Available data on employment
and wages are inadequate and do not permit satisfactory forecasts of manpower
requirements. These projections are therefore intended to indicate only
general orders of magnitude. To be conservative, they are based on lower
sectoral growth rates than those postulated in the Fifth Plan, (1978 - 1983),
and are considered reasonable (GDP would grow at 5% rather than 7.5%).
1.08      Table 1.1 shows also the employment structure by sector in 1978.
The sectoral composition of employed persons has changed little since then.          
In 1978, agricultural employees comprised 57% of the labor force, while
industrial sector employment (manufacturing, construction, utilities, and
transport) accounted for about 23% of the labor force.
1.09      The projection of Pakistan's annual domestic requirements for
skilled and semi-skilled manpower by sector is based on employment elasti-
cities which are consistent with Bank projections for growth and sectoral
value added over the period 1978 - 1985. Annual expansion rates used were
3% for agriculture, 6.5% for manufacturing and 5% for other sectors. For
replacement of persons leaving the labor force, an annual figure of 1.6% was
used for the manufacturing, construction, transport and utilities sectors.
These projections which result in an annual increase of about 3% per annum in
employment, represent the economic demand for new and replacement personnel

only. However, an additional 450,000 persons would enter the labor force each
year, but most of these would be absorbed I/ into informal employment mainly
as unskilled and service workers in agriculture (about 65%) and service
workers (35%). Moreover, this does, not take into account the exodus of manpower
mainly to the Middle East and Gulf states.
1.10           In sum, Pakistan's annual domestic requirement for skilled workers
is estimated at about 43,000, of which, two thirds are non-agricultural. The
total annual requirement for skilled and semi-skilled workers, including the
agricultural sector, is estimated at around 226,000. The annual requirement
in the manufacturing, construction, utilities and transport sectors is
estimated at 84,000 skilled and semi-skilled workers per year. This com-
pares with an annual output of 10,000 skilled workers from Government-operated
formal training programs (Table 2.1).
Foreign Manpower Demand
1.11           The estimated deficit of skilled/semi-skilled labor (domestic
demand-domestic supply) is compounded by the emigration of workers mainly to
the Middle East (paragraph 1.06). Table 1.2 shows the numbers of skilled/
semi-skilled workers by occupation who have emigrated from Pakistan during the
period 1974-1979. Despite domestic shortages of skilled manpower, the
Government has so far not attempted to limit the export of manpower, because
of the practical difficulties of keeping people in the country against their

will and the benefits of this activity. The most important benefit is remit-
tances, which constitute the largest source of foreign exchange earnings in
Pakistan. In 1979, remittances from Pakistani workers reached US$1,700
million and this helped to alleviate pressure on the external account-. While
the short-term benefits of this export of manpower are obvious and relatively
easy to quantify in financial terms, the short- and longer-term costs to the
economy of reducing further the country's already severely limited stock of
skilled and semi-skilled manpower, are difficult to estimate. The Government
and IDA are currently undertaking a study of labor migration from Pakistan
with a view to assessing its costs and benefits and providing a basis for
specific manpower export and development policies.
1.12      Table 1.2 also shows that the skilled workers' share of total emigra-
tion has declined from 70% in 1974, to about 46% of total emigration in 1979.
Since the foreign demand for Pakistani labor is mainly linked to growth in the
oil-based economies of the Middle East, it is assumed that the composition of
labor demand will continue to change, reflecting changes in these economies.
By the mid- and late-1980s, the labor demand in the oil exporting countries
is likely to shift towards highly-skilled technical manpower as investment
programs in infrastructure, (which require a relatively higher unskilled labor
component), give way to investments in services and technologically-advanced
manufacturing.
1.13      The order-of-magnitude estimates in Table 1.3 are therefore conserv-
ative, based on the assumption that the rapid increase in manpower exports
(skilled/semi-skilled workers) over the past five years (about 3,500 per
month) will not be sustained. It also assumes that by the mid-1980s, the
demand for technical labor will be higher than for skilled/semi-skilled labor.

Imbalance
1.14      The annual demand for skilled/semi-skilled workers (domestic and
foreign) is estimated at about 100,000. Since the output from formal Govern-
ment vocational training programs is around 10,000, this leaves a deficit of
90,000 workers. However, in response to this demand, numerous private esta-
blishments have been opened. In the Punjab and Sind Provinces, there are over
100 private institutions accredited by the Provincial Boards of Technical
Education. These institutions, and more than 300 unaccredited private insti-
tutions, have an estimated annual output of around 20,000 skilled/semi-skilled
workers. When coupled with the training conducted in the informal sector, it
is estimated that an additional 40,000 semi-skilled workers enter the labor
force annually. This leaves an annual imbalance of approximately 50,000
skilled/semi-skilled workers. It should be noted that since the quality of
training is low at most private and informal sector establishments, trainees
normally enter the labor force as semi-skilled workers.
1.15      The shortage of skilled labor is expected to continue to impede
Pakistan's development plans. It will continue to hinder the achievement of
production targets in the industrial sector, while limiting productivity gains
achieved by increasing other inputs to the production process. The shortage
of skilled labor will also make it difficult for Pakistan to capitalize fully
on the benefits of exDorting manpower to the Middle East. On the domestic
side, the estimated annual demand of about 84,000 skilled/semi-skilled workers
may be reduced by the return of workers from the Middle East. Similarly, in
the foreign market, increased competition from other labor exporting countries,
and a change in development priorities and employment opportunities of some
Middle Eastern states may lessen the demand for Pakistani labor. Nonetheless,
Pakistan's overall development, and its industrial development in particular,
will necessitate a much greater supply of skilled manpower than the present
output capacity of its training institutions. Pakistan, therefore, should
create the institutions and programs needed to meet short- and medium-term
skilled manpower requirements.
II. VOCATIONAL TRAINING IN PAKISTAN
The Existing Vocational Training System
2.01      Responsibility for the administration of industrial vocational train-
ing in Pakistan is divided between the respective Provinces and the Federal
Government. At the provincial level, the Labor Departments operate (a) 10
Technical Training Centers (TTCs) offering two-year full-time courses in 22
trades; (b) in the Punjab and Baluchistan, 15 Government Vocational Institutes
(GVIs) offering two-year full-time courses in 16 Trades 1/ and; (c) supervise
297 industrial establishments which operate apprenticeship programs in 62
1/   In the Punjab and Baluchistan, the administration of the GVIs was
recently transferred from the Education Departments to the Labor Depart-
ments. In Sind and NWFP, they are still administered by the Education
Departments.



trades. The Education Departments in conjunction with the Boards of Technical
Education operate (a) in the Sind and NWFP, nine Government Vocational Insti-
tutes (GVIs); and (b) six Polytechnics which offer industrial vocational
courses in 16 trades during a second shift. The Boards of Technical Education
also regulate through accreditation, the large number of private training
schools which constitute a significant part of the manpower training system.
On the federal level, the Ministry of Labor, Manpower and Overseas Pakistanis
through its attached agencies operates two programs. The National Training
Bureau runs the "Crash Program" of intensive short courses in 30 centers,
while the Overseas Workers Foundation runs short courses for potential emi-
grants in 21 centers.  Both programs utilize existing public and private
training facilities during second shifts.
2.02      The TTCs and the GVIs operate the regular one-and-a-half to two-
year full-time course and differ mainly in the target population which they
serve. The TTCs aim at serving adults and drop-outs from the educational
system aged 16 - 25 years, and apprentices. Secondary schools in Pakistan
have not attempted occupational training and accordingly, GVIs have consti-
tuted the industrial education track for students wishing to pursue further
education in industrial and related fields. They provide 18 - 24 month pro-
grams, the duration depending upon the selected field of training for students
over the age of 16 and with eight to ten years of schooling. The program
combines academic and skills training, and has traditionally been regarded as
leading to further education, rather than employment. Apprentices and voca-
tional trainees are not differentiated with the exception that registered
apprentices are supposed to be supervised on the job, and their training fees
are paid by employers. Consequently, apprentices and vocational trainees may
be found in attendance at GVIs, TTCs and the newer Apprentice Training Centers
(ATCs). The trend is toward the intensive sandwich-type courses usually
associated with apprentice training.
2.03      Table 2.1 shows that in 1979, the total output from the formal
vocational training system was just over 10,000. Of these, 400 were trained
at the GVIs; 1,300 in the TTCs; 2,000 by the Overseas Workers' Foundation;
1,250 under apprenticeship schemes, and over 5,000 by the Crash Training Pro-
gram operated by the Manpower Division of the Ministry of Labor and Manpower.
Financing of Vocational Training
2.04      By developing country standards, Pakistan spends only a small share
of its resources on education and training. In 1978, expenditure on education
amounted to 7.5% of total public expenditures by comparison with a range of
10%-21% in seven other Asian countries (see Comparative Education Indicators--
Annex 1). For FY1978, budgeted recurrent expenditure on education and train-
ing (provincial and federal) amounted to Rs 2,506 million, or 9.0% of the
country's current budget expenditures and 1.7% of GDP. Development expendi-
tures totalled Rs 772 million in 1979 and accounted for about 4% of the Annual
Development Program. About 95% of education expenditure is allocated to the
Ministry of Education. Expenditure on vocational technical/training has
always accounted for less than 6% of educational expenditures (Table 2.2).
The low expenditure on vocational training is confirmed by very low trainee
costs per hour which vary from about US$0.15 to US$0.27, as compared to a
range of US$0.50-US$1.00, typical of developing countries. The low costs

are due mainly to low expenditures on the wages of trainees and of teaching
materials. Increased expenditure on training will be required to produce
qualified skilled workers in sufficient quantities to meet industrial needs.
However, in view of the continuing budgetary constraints, cost-efficient
training alternatives should be explored and in-plant training encouraged as
under the proposed project-.
Issues in Vocational Training
2.05      The main issues in vocational training are its relevance to the
needs of the economy, the poor quality and low quantity of output from exist-
ing institutions and the lack of a coordinated and integrated vocational
training system.
A.   Relevance to the Needs of the Economy
(i)  Lack of Manpower Assessment and Strategy:
Provincial training plans have been made on an ad hoc
basis without prior assessment of the labor market,
including the skilled manpower needs of public and
private enterprises. In the absence of labor market
analysis and forecasts of skilled labor requirements
as a basis for planning, training programs have not
provided timely response to developing national
manpower needs.
(ii)  Lack of In-Plant Training:
Few employers have established in-plant upgrading and
updating programs as a means to increase the productiv-
ity of workers through training. The Apprenticeship
Training Ordinance 1962, intended to promote this
activity is not enforceable, as evidenced by the fact
that in 1979 of some 6,000 enterprises employing more
than 50 workers and therefore subject to the training
provisions of the Ordinance, only 279 participated,
with a total output of only 1,250 skilled workers.
(iii)  Limited Involvement of Employers in Vocational Training:
Training institutions and government departments have
failed to involve employers in the development and
continuous updating of institutional training programs,
feed-back on the effectiveness of training, and
forecasts of employment opportunities. Employers have
not been adequately involved in the evaluation of
institutional training programs or in the development
of in-plant training programs linking training insti-
tutions and industries.
B.   Low Skill Level of Trainees from Training Institutions:  Five
principal factors contribute to the low skill levels
acquired by graduates of training institutions. They are:



- 10 -
(i) Insufficient Consumable Training Materials:
The low skill levels among graduates of many TTCs,
and almost all GVIs, are partly attributable to
an inadequate supply of consumable training materials.
Without materials, instructors substitute classroom
periods for practical workshop sessions, thus denying
trainees the practical experience necessary for skill
development. The training materials allocation per
trainee for GVIs averages Rs 192 per year and for TTCs
about Rs 560 per year while Rs 1,200 per year would be
a reasonable average allocation. To achieve skill
levels adequate for job entry in short-term courses,
the specified practical workshop sessions (about 70% -
80% of total time) must be observed, and this would
necessitate an increased supply of consumable mate-
rials and an adequate budget to keep the institutions
appropriately stocked with them.
(ii) Inadequate Availability of Equipment:
Much of the equipment in the training centers,
particularly the GVIs, is either obsolete or requires
major repair. As enrollment is close to capacity (in
the TTCs), equipment time per trainee is drastically
curtailed, adversely affecting individual trainee
skill development.
(iii) Lack of Trade Tests and Standards:
National trade testing procedures have not been
developed in the absence of a central institution
to establish training standards and to design,
produce and update teaching materials. The Punjab
Government, with the assistance of experts from the
Federal Republic of Germany, has developed a trade
testing procedure in ten mechanical and electrical
trades and the National Training Bureau, with the
assistance of ILO, is working on standards for the
construction trades. There is a need to consolidate
these efforts and to establish standards in an
extended range of occupations. Implementation of
national training standards will reduce the present
disparities in skill levels, assist employers in
recruiting workers and promote the establishment
of wage scales commensurate with skill levels.
(iv) Lack of Qualified Instructors:
Also affecting the quality of training are the uneven
skill levels of administrative and instructional
staffs. With few exceptions, this is due to poor
motivation resulting from low salary levels. Instruc-
tors in the GVIs receive an average of 2% less than
the entry level wages of equivalent skilled workers
in industry, while the instructors in the TTCs are



- 11 -
not much better off receiving about 14% more than GVI
instructors. There are, therefore, many vacancies in
the GVIs and the instructors who remain are generally
unskilled, have no industrial experience and are
unable to develop trainees who are acceptable to
industry. There is an urgent need to rationalize the
salary scales of instructors throughout the system
and to relate these scales to proven skill levels,
industrial experience and appropriate instructor
training.
(v) Lack of Supervision of Training Centers:
There is evidence that training programs lack another
essential ingredient of success, namely, strong leader-
ship through supervision at each level of instruction
and administration. Supervisory grades for instructors
have been introduced but are used as salary inducements
rather than as a means to improve the quality of
instruction through supervision. The result has been
deteriorating standards of performance of instructors
and administrators.
C.   Low Output from Existing Institutions
(i) Single shift operations contribute to inadequate
output from existing training institutions. Further-
more, in 1979, only 50% of the places available in
the GVIs were filled because of a lack of instructors
and consumable materials with which to conduct
practical courses. By introducing second and third
shifts and improving the quality of instruction,
output from both the GVIs and TTCs could be substan-
tially increased.
(ii) Existing training programs have been standardized at
two years' duration primarily to permit the inclusion
of academic subjects for the benefit of students who
may later wish to proceed to further education. The
result has been overly protracted and costly programs
which tend to become progressively less practical and
more academic. Economies can be achieved through
shorter programs by recruiting candidates who already
hold the requisite general education requirements, and
through the introduction of intensive skill training.
Moreover, the duration of courses should be appropriate
to the particular occupation and directed to job entry
qualifications. Training to full competency would
continue on the job and through periodic or evening
upgrading courses. The duration of the pre-employment
training accordingly might vary from one to twelve
months or an average of six months depending upon the
skill and technical knowledge content of the occupa-
tion and local job entry requirements.

D.   Poor Coordination
The industrial manpower training system (paragraph 2.01-
2.02) is an aggregation of several virtually parallel systems
of institutions and programs. The complexity of the system
and the overlapping training functions may be attributed to
the fact that under the constitution, vocational training is
a concurrent function of the Federal and Provincial Govern-
ments. Consequently, the Federal Training Board (FTB), an
advisory body, which was established in 1976 to coordinate
vocational training with provincial training authorities
and employers, has proven ineffective up to now. 1/ The
Board has lacked authority and has been unable to establish
adequate linkages with the Ministry of Education, Provincial
Governments and employers. It failed to establish coordina-
tion in such aspects as training needs assessment, prepara-
tion of annual training plans, course and curriculum
development, training materials production, standards and
trade testing, staff training and the placement and follow-
up of graduates. The National Training Bureau acts as the
secretariat of FTB.
Government Programs and Policies
2.06      In early 1978, in order to overcome the problems discussed above
(para 2.05), the Government, with the assistance of ILO and IDA, embarked on a
study of the vocational training system. The outcome was a Vocational Training
Plan (VTP) for the period 1978 - 1983. The major problems confronting the sys-
tem were highlighted and strategies for correcting deficiencies and promoting
training outlined. The training strategies proposed in the Training Plan con-
sisted of the following:
(a) restructuring of the national training management system to:
(i)  establish strong linkages with the Provincial
Governments and employers;
(ii)  encompass rural and women's training; and
(iii)  provide channels for the increased flow of
training funds;
(b)  reorganizing and expanding the training delivery system with
the main emphasis on increasing the utilization of existing
facilities through double shift operation and
the adoption of short courses; and
1/   With the enactment of the National Manpower Ordinance (see para 2.07) in
March 1980, the role and authority of the FTB has been significantly
strengthened.



- 13 -
(c) improving the skill level of trainees through the training
and upgrading of instructors and increasing the supply of
training materials.
2.07      In March 1980, the Government acting on the recommendations included
in the VTP, enacted the National Manpower Ordinance. The new management
structure enabled by the ordinance has the potential to overcome the difficul-
ties that have hampered vocational training in the past and includes a National
Training Board (NTB) and Provincial Training Boards (PTBs). The Boards are
broadly representative of Federal ministries and Provincial departments as the
case may be, and of industry, labor and the private training organizations.
The NTB would be served by a Secretariat, and a National Training Development
Institute (NTDI) and would administer the National Training Board Fund. The
new national management training system is described in paragraphs 3.04-3.06.
2.08      In addition to reorganizing the management of vocational training
the Government has decided to implement the following in the 1978-83 period in
its pursuit of VTP objectives:
(a) use a second shift in public, and some private institutions,
to produce, through the use of the modular and accelerated
training system, an additional 5,000 semi-skilled workers
per year under the so-called "Crash Program";
(b) construct seven new Polytrade Centers for the Overseas
Workers Foundation in order to train another 10,000 workers
per year;
(c)  expand vocational training facilities, including the esta-
blishment of eight new TTCs; provide additional equipment
for four existing TTCs and re-equip all (24) GVIs;
(d) expand in-plant training through a financial incentive sys-
tem to employers including infrastructure grants, capitation
fees and the subsidization of apprentice wages;
(e) expand rural artisan training through the establishment of
rural training/production centers; and
(g) expand women's training through support to training/produc-
tion centers for women in the Punjab and Sind Provinces.
2.09      The "Crash Program" (para 2.08(a)) is now operational, and four of
the Overseas Workers Foundation Polytrade Centers (para 2.08(b)) have been
completed. Also, the government signed an agreement with UNDP/ILO in 1978
which provides assistance for the expansion and upgrading of training facili-
ties (para 2.08(c)), instructor training, curriculum development and develop-
ment of trade standards and tests (para 2.11). Under the project appraised in
this report, these activities would continue and be expanded where necessary,
to meet the requirements of a larger project. An in-plant/supervisory train-
ing program would also be undertaken.

External Financing of Vocational Training
2.10      Since 1967, the Government has received technical assistance from
multilateral and bilateral sources for vocational training. The Swedish
Government assisted in the development of the Swedish-Pakistan Institute
of Technology which operates evening programs for vocational training, and
the Netherlands Government provided US$0.75 million for the Pak-Netherlands
Training Center at Multan. The Federal Republic of Germany's assistance has
been the most extensive; in addition to US$2 million in equipment for the
TTCs at Ghulberg and Moghulpura, the German Government has assisted in the
establishment of an Apprenticeship Training Wing and a Development Cell in
the Punjab Labor Department. The development of these two institutions
involved over 35 man-years of German technical assistance and 40 fellowships
(1-2 years each) for Pakistanis.
2.11      UNDP/ILO have also assisted the Government.  They provided assis-
tance for the preparation of the Vocational Training Plan and since 1978,
UNDP/ILO have been financing services of international experts, spares and
equipment under the Federal Program for Skill Development (US$1.55 million).
The principal objective of this project is the development of necessary
legislation and regulations required for the introduction of efficient and
uniform national skill training programs. This objective has been achieved
with the enactment of the National Manpower Ordinance of March 1980 (para
2.07). Other project activities have included:
(a) the revision and expansion of the existing national classi-
fication of occupations;
(b) the formulation of nationally-recognized and accepted Trade
Standards;
(c) determination of the content of training programs and deve-
lopment of trade standards utilizing Modules of Employable
Skills (MES);
(d) upgrading the equipment of nine operational TTCs and provid-
ing new equipment for two newly established TTCs in Quetta
(six Trades) and Sukkur (four Trades).
(e) preparation of training programs for instructors and the
organization of staff training courses in selected trade
areas at chosen TTCs; and
(f) development of a nationally-recognized skill testing sys-
tem through the determination of methods for skill test-
ing; the development of one pilot skill Testing Center in
each province, and the introduction of uniform trade/skill
certificates.
2.12      The project is administered by the National Training Bureau and has
been in full operation for two years.  It has fallen short of its objectives,



- 15 -
mainly because of the inadequate operational budget allocated by the Govern-
ment. Unfortunately, very few members of the Training Bureau's staff have
had previous experience in vocational training. As a consequence counterparts
with proper backgrounds and qualifications have not been assigned to any
of the ILO experts in the project. A project revision to adjust project
objectives so as to integrate it with the revised Government training strategy
and the proposed IDA project is now underway.
Bank Group Participation in Education and Training
2.13      Four IDA Credits totalling US$37.5 million have been made to the
education sector in Pakistan. These projects were mainly (53% of total
expenditures) directed to post-secondary and higher education, and (73% in
terms of sectoral impact) to agricultural, technical and teacher education.
The first two education projects (Cr 50-PAK, 1964 and Cr. 206-PAK, 1970) have
now been completed. 1/   They provided US$8.5 million and US$4 million,
respectively, to improve and expand post-secondary education (an agricultural
university, industrial technician training and an engineering college). The
Third Education Project (Cr 678-PAK, 1977) is providing US$15 million to
assist in expanding and improving: (a) middle- and higher-level agricultural
education; and (b) general teacher training, particularly in rural areas and
among females. The Fourth Education Project (Cr 892-PAK, 1979) is providing
US$10 million to assist the Government to ascertain the effects of four inputs
--improved teacher training, increased supervision, better instructional mate-
rials and more adequate physical facilities in reaching four objectives: more
access, less dropout, greater learning achievement and reduced unit recurrent
costs in primary education.
2.14      Performance in the implementation of these projects has been marked
by considerable delays in the first two projects. However, the situation
has steadily improved despite the fact that subsequent projects became larger
and more complex in their design and objectives.  The following summary of
each project describes the experiences and the measures taken to overcome the
problems encountered. The First Education Project (Cr. 50-PAK) was completed
about eight years behind schedule. The main factors of delay were of an
unpredictable nature and included: (a) two wars, (b) floods, (c) shortages
of materials, and (d) sharp price increases with subsequent suspension of work.
Other factors were: (a) cumbersome implementation procedures, (b) unfamiliar-
ity of project staff with IDA procedures, and (c) late appointment of consult-
ing architects. The Second Education Project (Cr. 206-PAK) which was completed
3.5 years behind schedule suffered to a lesser extent from similar shortcomings.
The main factor of delay, however, was the Government of Sind's reluctance to
use Credit funds for foreign experts and fellowships. In the Third Education
Project, in order to strengthen implementation capacity and to avoid repetition
of earlier delays (Credit 678-PAK), special arrangements were made to improve
project implementation by: (i) establishing revolving funds to avoid delays
caused by rupee shortages; (ii) training of project staff in a Bank-sponsored
implementation seminar helped avoid delays caused under earlier projects by
1/   Completion reports have been produced for the two projects but PPARs are
not yet available.



- 16 -
staff's unfamiliarity with IDA procedures; (iii) assigning specific personnel
in existing line agencies to implement the project; (iv) establishing a Federal
Project Coordinating Unit with linkages to the Bureau of Educational Planning
(BEP) to coordinate all aspects of the project; and (v) making the signing of
technical assistance contracts a condition of credit disbursement for portions
of the project, in an effort to avoid repetition of earlier delays experienced
in the hiring of technical assistance. Despite a current five month implemen-
tation delay experienced under the Third Education Project (Credit 678-PAK),
there are indications that the above measures are helping to prevent problems
experienced under the first two projects. Similarly, in the Fourth Education
Project (Credit 892-PAK), further progress has been made in refining project
administration arrangements and in building implementation capacity. The
Bureau of Educational Planning (BEP) was strengthened to assume overall pro-
ject implementation responsibility and has been working in close collaboration
with the unit in charge of Credit 678-PAK. Also, the services of a project
architect and a procurement officer are being shared between the two organiza-
tions. Progress on the Fourth Education Project has been steady, and the
technical assistance program for training administrators and evaluators in the
primary education system is on schedule.
2.15      The experience described above has been taken into consideration in
designing the implementation organization necessary to carry out the proposed
project successfully. In this respect, federal and provincial responsibili-
ties were identified and described (paras 5.02-5.06) in order to avoid misun-
derstandings and overlapping of authority, and staffing patterns and degree of
technical assistance and staff training necessary were carefully considered.
2.16      In addition to project activities, the Bank has completed two major
sector studies in education and related fields: The Education chapter of the
April 1978 Population Planning and Social Services Report (Report No. 2018-
PAK) and the December 1978 Education Sector Memorandum (Report No. 2303-PAK).
2.17      The Government and IDA have shared three objectives in their joint
education activities, namely, meeting manpower needs, improving quality and--
more recently--increasing equity (for rural people and females). The first
objective, expansion of professional and technical education, was pursued
through the First and Second Education Projects. The completion report of
the First Education Project concluded that the physical objectives of the
project were accomplished in terms of training capacity but little qualitative
improvement in the technical institutes was achieved. Substantial improvement
in the quality of education in the agricultural university was attained but
demand for agriculture graduates was over-estimated and actual employment
opportunities were leass than originally expected. The Second Education Proj-
ect has been successful in meeting manpower needs, but student/staff ratios
are higher than those consistent with high quality education. This has been
caused by the excessive pressure for engineering education caused by both
domestic and foreign employment opportunities. In addition, staff quality is
much lower than desirable. This is a direct consequence of the poor salary
incentives offered to those in the teaching profession in Pakistan. It is
still too early to determine the extent to which objectives are being met in
the Third and Fourth Education Projects.

III. THE PROJECT
Project Formulation
3.01      Based on the Vocational Training Plan, in November 1978, the Govern-
ment with ILO assistance prepared a project requesting IDA financial assistance
for:  (a) the implementation of the national vocational management system (para
2.07); (b) the expansion of vocational training facilities (para 2.08(a)(b)(c)):
(c) the implementation of the in-plant training scheme (para 2.08(d)); and (d)
the establishment of rural and women's training/production facilities (para
2.08(e)(f)). The total capital cost of the proposal presented was US$69.0
million, excluding contingencies. While the overall objectives of the Govern-
ment's request were desirable, implementation schedules were excessively
optimistic in light of previous vocational training projects, the availability
of recurrent funds, and the management capacity of the implementing agency.
As a result of discussions between the Government and the Association, the
proposals were modified to reflect Pakistan's implementation capacity and to
focus on the primary objective of improving and expanding industrial vocational
training.
Objectives
3.02      The main purpose of the proposed project is to assist the Government
in implementing its strategy to strengthen and expand skills training to meet
manpower requirements for the industrial sector and to overcome shortages of
manpower caused by the emigration of skilled workers. The proposed project
would pursue three objectives:  (a) help increase the capability of the Govern-
ment to plan, manage and evaluate skill training; (b) improve the quality and
increase the output from vocational training institutions by about 10,000 per
year; and (c) improve the productivity of employed workers. The first objec-
tive, would be sought through assistance to the new agencies created under
authorization of the National Manpower Training Ordinance (para 2.07). The
second objective, would be pursued through expanding training capacity, and
reducing the length of training programs from two years to six months. The
third objective, would be sought through the introduction of upgrading courses
and in-plant training for employed workers.
3.03      The Project would comprise:
(a) construction, furniture and equipment for:
(i) the National Training Development Institute (NTDI);
(ii) six new vocational training centers located at Karachi,
Hyderabad, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Sialkot and Mardan; and
(iii) 31 existing training centers.
(b) furniture and equipment only for the National and four Provincial
Training Board Secretariats.



- 18 -
(c)  consumable training materials for all 37 vocational train-
ing centers (six new and 31 existing) and the NTDI.
(d)  incremental staff salaries for all project institutions
(NTB, four PTBs, NTDI and 37 training centers).
(e)  staff training for:
(i) 640 instructor staff for the training centers; and
(ii) 2,800 training personnel for in-plant training.
(f)  funds for the preparation of future Education Projects.
(g)  technical assistance, consisting of expatriate and local
technical experts, international and regional fellowships
and national workshops, financed by UNDP with ILO as exe-
cuting agency.
Project Components
A.   National Vocational Training Management System
3.04      Secretariat of the National Training Board (NTB) (Proposed Outlay
US$0.16 million). 1/ A national vocational training management system was
established by the Manpower Ordinance of March 1980. The system would
comprise the NTB, four PTBs and the NTDI. The NTB would be chaired by the
Federal Minister of Labor and Manpower and would have representation from
federal ministries including Education, Finance, Planning, Petroleum and
Natural Resources, and Water and Power. The Provinces would also be repre-
sented on the Board by Additional Chief Secretaries (Development) and the
Secretaries of the Departments of Education, Social Welfare and Rural Develop-
ment, and Manpower Training. Four representatives from employers and workers
organizations, each Province having one representative, would be included in
the Board. The NTB would be responsible for preparing regulations and legis-
lation pertaining to training, formulation of national policies, approval of
training plans and recommending allocations of financial resources. It would
also be responsible for evaluating existing curricula and performance, approv-
ing new curricula, national skill standards, and tests, and curtailing
ineffective programs. Decisions of the NTB would be channelled to the PTBs
for implementation.
3.05      The existing National Training Bureau, which is an attached depart-
ment of the Ministry of Labor and Manpower (Annex 2) would be the Secretariat
of the NTB.  The Bureau consists of four regional offices located at Lahore,
Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta and a headquarters in Islamabad. The Secretariat
would assist the NTB in carrying out its functions (paragraph 3.04). The pro-
posed project would finance furniture and equipment for the National Training
1/   This and subsequent statements of proposed outlays exclude contingencies.



- 19 -
Bureau to facilitate its expanded operations. Bureau staff will also be
trained and upgraded through a fellowship program financed by the UNDP (para
3.22).
3.06      Provincial Training Boards (PTBs) (Proposed outlay US$0.19 million).
Under the Manpower Ordinance, the PTBs would be similarly constituted as the
NTB but with the Provincial Secretary of Labor acting as Chairman. The PTBs
would be responsible for approving training schemes and recommending them to
the NTB for financing. The Provincial Labor Departments would act as the
Secretariats to the PTBs and would be responsible for executing the approved
training programs, inspection and supervision of vocational training, organi-
zing trade testing and in-plant advisory services, assessing training needs
and preparing provincial training plans. The proposed project would assist
in strengthening the Provincial Labor Departments by financing equipment and
salaries of the additional staff required to make them function as Secre-
tariats.
3.07      National Training Development Institute (NTDI) (Proposed Outlay
US$1.44 million).  The NTB and PTBs would be assisted by the NTDI.  The
Institute would carry out job analysis, curriculum development, training
material design and production, skill standard setting and the evaluation of
training methodology and delivery systems. It would organize courses for
instructors (both skill upgrading and methodology), training center senior
staff and company training personnel. The NTDI would be headed by a Director
and would consist of five departments, i.e., occupational analysis and cur-
riculum development, trade testing, staff training, training materials deve-
lopment; and research and evaluation. The proposed project would finance
construction, furniture and equipment for the NTDI in order to centralize
vocational training research and evaluation in the country. It would also
finance the salaries of staff required for establishing the NTDI. During
negotiations, the Government gave an assurance that preliminary designs for
the NTDI would be submitted to the Association for its review by December 31,
1981.
3.08      About 122 professional and higher support staff would be required
to staff the Training Boards and the NTDI. Existing staff in the National
Training Bureau and the Provincial Labor Departments amount to 68 persons
leaving a net increase of about 54. Table 3.1 shows the recruitment plan for
the professional staff for the Boards and NTDI. All professional staff would
receive training through either (a) the fellowship program financed by UNDP
(para 3.22); (b) participation in courses organized by the technical assis-
tance experts financed by UNDP; or (c) working as counterparts to the experts.
To facilitate the establishment of the four Provincial Secretariats which, as
technical institutions, are fundamental to the organization and management of
vocational training in Pakistan, staff salaries would be financed out of the
credit for 5 years. IDA financing would amount to about 45% of the total cost
of salaries and consumable materials. During negotiations the Association
and the Government agreed to the staffing pattern and budgetary provisions for
the NTDI. The PC-1 which includes these agreements has been approved by the
Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC).

B.   Industrial Training
3.09      Industrial training capacity would be increased from about 10,000 to
about 20,000 p.a. by reducing the average length of job entry courses from two
years to an average of between six and nine months in most institutes and
operating training centers on two shifts where this is not being done already
(paras 2.05(c) (i) and (ii)). In addition, six new centers would be construc-
ted. Skill levels would be upgraded by the provision of equipment, the supply
of consumable training materials, staff training and trade testing. Courses
in the training centers would be linked with structured in-plant training for
apprentices.
3.10      Training Centers (Proposed outlay US$27.93 million).  The proposed
project would finance six new training centers located in industrial urban
areas where training demand is high. These are: Lahore, Sialkot, Rawalpindi,
Landhi (Karachi), Hyderabad and Mardan. The project would also finance the
rehabilitation and re-equipping of 31 existing centers. The range of courses
offered at the centers would include fitting, turning, machining, welding,
electricity, radio, instrument mechanics, auto and diesel mechanics, carpentry,
plumbing and pipefitting, bricklaying, drafting, sheet metal work, pattern-
making and refrigeration. Specialized training such as forging and heat
treatment, electroplating and leatherwork has been provided in centers located
in areas where such training is warranted. Three of the new training centers
located at Karachi, Hyderabad and Mardan and one center expanded at Faisalabad
will also include facilities for training textile operators and maintenance
personnel. Starting with the next admission of trainees after July 1981, a
second-shift of short job entry courses of about six months duration (720
hours) would be introduced at the following nine existing technical training
centers: Gulberg, Mogulpura, Multan, R.Y. Khan, Gujarkhan, Kotri, Nazimabad,
Peshawar and Quetta. These centers would continue to operate the long course
program (2 years) during the first shift. In all other project institutions,



- 21 -
short courses would be introduced and operated on both shifts. During nego-
tiations the Government gave assurances that with the next admission of
trainees after July 31, 1981 it would introduce short job entry courses of
about six months duration in all projett institutions and specifically in the
second-shift at nine TTCs operating long courses during the first shift. The
Government also provided assurances that it would establish by December 31,
1981, national skill standards for mechanical, electrical and construction
trades (para 2.05(b)(iii)) satisfactory to the Association and would test and
certify students in these trades. The Government further provided assurances
that it would establish by June 30, 1982, national skill standards and tests
for all additional trades offered at vocational training institutions.
3.11      To ensure that all courses in the training centers are relevant to
the needs of local industry, the Government undertook and completed a training
needs assessment with ILO assistance, among industrialists in the catchment
area of each center. Final decisions on the courses have, therefore, been
made, and preliminary equipment lists and workshop layouts developed. In
order that close links with industry continue and the training is relevant to
local labor market needs, the government provided an assurance that advisory
committees would be established with industry representation within six months
of the opening of each new institution and by December 1981 for all existing
project centers. During negotiations, the Government gave an assurance that
preliminary designs for the six new training centers would be submitted to the
Association for its review by December 31, 1981. 1/ As a condition of Credit
effectiveness, the Government has been asked to enter into an agreement with
a consulting architectural firm whose qualifications, experience and terms
and conditions of employment are satisfactory to the Association, which would
provide design and supervision services for the entire project.
3.12      The minimum general requirements for admission would be 16 years of
age and completion of Grade 8, except in such trades as radio repair and
drafting where a secondary school certificate may be necessary. As far as
possible, trainees would be placed in the institution-linked in-plant training
scheme. Where such schemes call for evening courses in association with the
on-the-job training, these would be arranged. Those graduates not placed in
the scheme would be assisted in finding work by the employment service of the
Department of Labor.
3.13          The training centers would require about 640 additional trade
instructors and some 12 senior technical staff (staff/trainee ratio 1:10).
Trade instructors would be recruited from among skilled workers and foremen in
industrial occupations. They should be literate and numerate and have a
minimum of five years of industrial experience in their specialty. (Table
3.2 shows an instructor and senior staff recruitment schedule.) The selection
procedure would include literacy, numeracy and skills tests designed to
1/   This is a departure from OMS 2.28 which requires completion of prelimi-
nary designs prior to Board Presentation. However, since the majority
of training centers (31) included in the project already exist, it would
be unfair to delay the project.

highlight skill competence. During negotiations, the Association and the
Government agreed to the staffing pattern and recruitment schedule of addi-
tional instructors for the Training Centers.

3.14      At present 435 instructors are employed in the vocational training
institutions.  Generally, they do not have the requisite level of skills for
vocational instruction. In addition, about fifty percent of the sanctioned
posts in the GVIs are unfilled mainly because the salaries of the instructors
are not comparable with wages received by skilled workers in the open market.
Wages of skilled workers range from Rs 50 to Rs 70 per day or Rs 2,000 per
month. Present pay scales of instructors range from Rs 370-700 per month
(National Pay Scales Grade 8-9). Since the recruitment and retention in ser-
vice of skilled instructors is the key to the success of the vocational train-
ing component of the project, the Government has agreed to an enhanced scale
of remuneration for instructors. Instructor salaries have now been increased
to Rs 520-1,325 per month (NPS Grades 14-16). When these salaries are com-
bined with the normal housing, medical and other benefits of Government
employment, it is expected that instructor salaries would be competitive with
those available to skilled workers in the private sector. The Government has
further agreed that instructors would be hired on contract rates of Rs 2,000
per month or more, should it prove difficult to recruit suitable qualified
instructors even at the enhanced scales. The PC-I including budgetary allo-
cations on the proposed scale for instructors has been approved by ECNEC.
3.15      Because of transportation problems and the need to extend the catch-
ment area of some TTCs, boarding accomodation has been included for some
institutions averaging about 17% of the student capacity in all institutions.
Additional boarding facilities will not be provided at institutions where the
Government is already providing accomodations, nor at institutions located in
urban areas. Furthermore, to facilitate the changeover to short courses and
double shift operation in existing training centers, the start-up of the new
centers, and upgrading of skill levels among trainees, salaries and consumable
training materials would be financed by the credit for five years starting
July 1981. Financing would average 45% of total costs of additional pro-
fessional salaries and consumable materials. The PC-I, including the foreign

exchange needs for consumable training materials which are not covered by IDA
funds, has been approved by ECNEC.
3.16      Instructor Training.  Instructor training programs will have to be
undertaken on a large scale not only for the newly recruited instructors but
also for upgrading the competence of the existing instructors in both skill
and training methodology. Skill upgrading courses of varying duration would
be carried out at existing TTCs located at Gulberg, Moghulpura, Kotri, Karachi,
Peshawar and Rawalpindi. This would be a continuation of the work already
undertaken by the ILO (para 2.11(v)). These courses would upgrade instruc-
tors' skills to established standards. The senior instructors of these
institutions would assume full responsibility for instructor skill training
and upgrading. Together with existing supervisory staff they would partici-
pate in a series of courses organized by the ILO experts in conjunction with
the NTDI in the organization and management of training centers. During
negotiations, the Government provided an assurance that it would submit to the
Association for its review, a draft Training Plan by July 31, 1981. The
Training Plan would be prepared with ILO technical assistance (para 3.22) and
would be integrated and coordinated with the on-going ILO sponsored staff
training program. The project would finance the travel and daily allowance of
instructors and NTDI staff involved in training. It would also cover the cost
of consumable training materials and other instructional materials including
audio-visual training aids.
3.17      In-Plant Training (Proposed outlay US$1.08 million).  Although
institutional training is the central feature of the Government's Vocational
Training Plan, training within industrial enterprises is an integral part of
the strategy. Efforts to involve employers more intimately with training
and its benefits are envisaged under the project. First, employers through
advisory committees will be involved in the functioning of training insti-
tutions, and would be able to have courses and curricula adjusted periodically
to meet their manpower needs (para 3.11). The second form of employer involve-
ment in training is through in-plant training. An in-plant training program
is needed to upgrade unskilled workers and to replace skilled workers who are
leaving industry for employment abroad. Employment of a disproportionate
number of unskilled workers in industry results in low productivity and high
wastage and accident rates. The project would assist in the establishment of
an In-Plant Training Advisory Service which would be located in the Provin-
cial Labor Departments. The Advisory Service would provide a comprehensive
range of services to public and private industry: the diagnosis of training
needs, the preparation and organization of training programs and materials,
and measuring the effectiveness of training within the enterprise. Training
programs would focus on improving manufacturing efficiency and product quality
and maintenance techniques. With the assistance of the NTDI and technical
assistance (ILO experts) a cadre of personnel would be developed for the
industrial sector, which, over time, would create effective training programs
to promote productivity as well as meeting the internal training needs of the
enterprises. Group training or individual, company-based schemes would be
organized and implemented.
3.18      Under the training scheme, 2,800 in-plant trainers will be trained
over the project period. The centerpiece of this training system is the



- 24 -
Module for Training Supervisors (MTS) which has been developed by the ILO and
utilized successfully in Norway and Iran. The MTS system is easy to install,
manage and operate, and once instituted it is a continuous process: i.e. the
Chief Trainer (from the Advisory Service) trains an In-Plant Trainer, who in
turn trains supervisors and they then train foremen and production workers
in the enterprise. With the MTS scheme, the involvement of management is
guaranteed because without their support, the scheme cannot be launched in
an organization. The Project would finance the salaries and vehicles of
the staff required for the establishment of the In-Plant Training Advisory
Service. It would also finance the production of training materials and the
cost of training the 2,800 in-plant trainers. Funds for the training of
supervisors and instructors for in-plant training, in the textile industry
have been provided in another IDA Credit. 1/
3.19      Evaluation.  A system of evaluation would be developed by the NTDI
with the assistance of technical experts financed under the UNDP Technical
Assistance Program (para 3.22). This system would evaluate the external and
internal effectiveness of the training activities financed under the project.
External evaluation would focus on the effect of training both on the enter-
prise and the trainee. Statistics would be gathered annually from represen-
tative enterprises in each industrial sector covering (i) number of appren-
tices and trainees engaged; (ii) expenditure on training; (iii) workers' wages
with training and without training; and (iv) evaluation of the training effort
in the productivity of the worker, labor turnover and mobility, the quality of
work produced, and the attitude of the worker. For the individual trainee a
career follow-up scheme would be devised to record his progress.
3.20      Internal evaluation would focus on the comparative advantages of
short courses and the training costs of different delivery systems. It would
aim at identifying the most cost-efficient system. During negotiations the
Government provided an assurance that it would make available to IDA a draft
evaluation plan for review and comments by July 31, 1981. It also provided an
assurance that it would establish and have operational by December 31, 1981, a
monitoring and evaluation system satisfactory to the Association, which would
evaluate annually the effectiveness and impact of the industrial training
programs carried out under the project. Finally, the Government provided an
assurance that it would submit to IDA for review and comment, annual evalua-
tion reports of the industrial skills training component for the duration of
the project.
3.21      Future Education Projects (Proposed outlay US$0.2 million).  Funds
have been included in the project for the preparation of future education and
training projects. Since this project is viewed as a first phase effort,
preparation of the second phase which would include possible assistance to
private training institutions would commence during the period of project
implementation.
3.22      Technical Assistance Program.  The total cost is estimated at
US$1.58 million. The UNDP has agreed to finance the technical assistance
1/   US$3.0 million has been included in the PICIC Industrial Development
Project.

with ILO acting as the Executing Agency because the proposed project repre-
sents a logical extension to the UNDP/ILO Federal Skills Development Project
(para 2.11). The project would require about 185 man-months of expatriate
experts for staff training, evaluation, curriculum development and national
skill standard setting and testing, and 185 man-months of locally recruited
technical staff. The project would also finance 168 man-months of adminis-
trative support staff. In addition, the program includes about 40 man-months
of international and regional fellowships and 450 man-months for national
workshops. The Government and the UNDP have already signed the technical
assistance contract to enable (a) the quick approval of equipment lists and a
speeding up of the procurement process; and (b) the early training of counter-
part staff to avoid the problems encountered by the ILO Federal Skill Develop-
ment Project (para 2.12).
IV. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
Project Cost
4.01      The total cost of the project is estimated at Rs 410.81 million or
US$41.48 million equivalent net of taxes and duties, excluding the technical
assistance financed under the UNDP/ILO Program (para 3.22). Detailed costs
and foreign exchange components are given in Annex 3. Costs by project item
are summarized in Table 4.1.

4.03      Base cost estimates refer to June 1980 prices, and were calculated
on the following basis:
Construction Costs - on facilities of a similar nature recently completed in
Pakistan. The average unit cost was estimated at about US$ 14 per sq. ft.
excluding site development and contingencies, compared with US$ 14 per sq
ft. in Nepal, US$ 12 in Bangladesh and US$10 in India for similar facilities.
Equipment and Furniture - on detailed equipment lists prepared with ILO assis-
tance, and minimum furniture requirements. Consumable Materials - on appro-
priate cost/trainee place (by trade) in comparable projects elsewhere in the
world. Architectural design and Supervision Services - on acceptable national
practices, about 5% of construction costs. Specialist Services at US$ 75,000
per man-year (expatriate consultants) and US$7,200 per man-year for locally
recruited consultants. Fellowships at US$30,000 per man-year. Operating and
Training Cost - on detailed breakdowns of staff requirements. Salaries - on
the proposed incentive package for instructors (para 3.13) and on applicable
National Pay Scales plus allowances (range PR 1325-2750-NPS 16-19).
4.04      Unit Areas and Costs of new facilities (net of contingencies, operat-
ing costs and costs for professional services) are shown in Table 4.3 below.
The planning of facilities has been based on functional and economic consider-
ations. Technical limitations, climatic and social factors have also been
taken into account. Unit costs were derived from recent building contracts
for similar facilities in Pakistan. Local materials and building techniques
would be used to the maximum extent possible.

Figures in parentheses are: median unit areas and costs of Bank-financed
projects in Asia (1974-77).  Costs were adjusted for price increases to 1980
(plus 40%).
Gross area allocations for student boarding facilities and staff housing are in
conformity with Government standards.  In aggregate, training facilities
account for about 52% of total baseline costs, and boarding and staff housing
for about 13%. The Training Center facilities would be economically used in
double shift operations.
4.05      Customs Duties and Taxes.  All goods specifically imported for the
project would be subject to customs duties and taxes. The total amount of



- 29 -
local taxes is estimated at about US$4.27 million. Instructional equipment
and consumable training materials are not exempt from taxes. During nego-
tiations the Government provided assurances that it would take necessary
steps, including the provision of adequate funds to ensure efficient customs
clearance of all goods imported for use under the project.
4.06     Contingency Allowances.  Estimated project costs include physical
contingencies (US$3.35 million) estimated at 10% of base cost for unforeseen
factors, and price contingencies (US$11.37 million) to cover expected price
escalation in accordance with the phasing of the project as shown in Table 4.4
below:

4.07      Foreign Exchange Component.  Based on detailed analysis of expen-
ditures in similar projects in Pakistan, the foreign exchange component has
been estimated as follows: (a) site development, 25%; (b) buildings 25%;
(c) furniture, 25%; (d) equipment, 87%; (c) professional services, 10%;
(f) consumable materials, 50%; (g) salaries 0%; (g) per diem expenditures 0%;
(i) learning materials 35%; and consultants' services 90%. These percentages
have been derived by (a) determining the costs of civil works attributable to
materials, labor overhead and profit, (b) analyzing the c.i.f. Karachi costs
of imported building materials equipment and furniture, inland transportation
and insurances, and delivery and installation of equipment and furniture. The
foreign exchange component is estimated at US$17.85 million, or about 43% of
the total project cost net of customs duties and taxes. Customs duties and
taxes imposed on imported building materials would be borne by the borrower.
Financial Plan
4.08      The total net project cost of US$41.48 million equivalent excluding
technical assistance would be financed as follows:
(a)  the proposed IDA credit of US$25.0 million would cover 60%
of total project costs net of taxes and duties (100% of the
foreign exchange costs and 30% of local costs); and



- 30 -
(b) the Government would finance the remaining net costs of
(us$16.48 million (40% of total project costs), and an
estimated US$4.27 million in taxes and duties.
An additional US$1.58 million equivalent for technical assistance (experts
and fellowships) would be financed by UNDP.

Recurrent Cost Implications
4.10      By 1985, projected annual recurrent costs would amount to about
Rs 69.04 million (US$6.97 million) for institutional vocational training
conducted under the Ministry of Labor and Manpower, and the Provincial Labor
and Education Departments. Annual recurrent costs (salaries and consumable
training materials only) of about Rs 39.17 million (US$3.96 million) would
be generated by the project institutions, the NTDI and the Secretariats of the
NTB and PTBs. Other recurrent costs would be incurred by ancilliary staff,
overhead costs, and institutions not financed under the project.

4.11      In 1978/79, recurrent expenditures on vocational/technical education
amounted to Rs 114 million (Table 2.2) (US$11.5 million) or 4% of recurrent
education expenditures. However, expenditures on institutional vocational
training accounted for Rs 12.52 million (Table 4.5) (US$1.2 million), which
is about 10.5% of vocational/technical expenditures or less than 1% of recur-
rent education expenditures.  In 1985, Rs 69.04 million would account for over
25% of vocational/technical education expenditures if they continue to grow
at a similar rate as in the past (about 4% p.a.) and would account for about
3% of total recurrent education expenditures which appears to be reasonable.
The cost per trainee hour is now about US$0.17, but under the project this
would increase to US$0.46 due mainly to the increase in the per-student
allocation of training materials, instructor salary increases, and allowances
for the maintenance and depreciation of equipment and buildings. The cost per
trainee hour would then be more in line with other countries (e.g., Bangladesh
US$0.37, Korea US$0.50).  Table 4.6 shows that while instructor salaries would
have increased they would account for a smaller share of overall recurrent
costs because allocations to consumable training materials and overheads have
increased substantially.
4.12      Flow of Funds.  The new organization of the NTB and PTBs would be
able to provide capital and operational financing, additional to that of the
provincial ADPs. The existing normal budgetary allocations for the training
programs already in the provincial ADPs would be supplemented by the NTB fund,
established under the National Manpower Ordinance (para 3.04). The funds would
be channelled through the PTBs to the executing agency (Provincial Labor
Departments). This procedure will also enable the NTB and PTBs to initiate
new training programs without the lengthy procedures of provincial budgetary
allocations.
4.13      Budget allocations would be made available to the project on an
annual basis in accordance with the Forecast of Expenditures and Disbursements
shown in Annex 7. In addition, the financial requirements for the project
would be reviewed regularly by the implementing agency (NTB and Provincial
Labor Departments) to ensure that project implementation is not delayed
because of lack of funds. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances
that it would:
(a) furnish to the Association by March 1 of each year of
implementation, an estimate of project funds required
for the following fiscal year; and
(b) make the necessary funds available to ensure prompt
project implementation.

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation
5.01       The project would be implemented over a period of about five years.
Completion of the physical facilities (including procurement and installation
of equipment and furniture) should be achieved in about three and a half years
from credit effectiveness (by about September 1984). To assist in effective
and timely project execution, a detailed implementation schedule has been
prepared (Annex 6). This schedule would also serve as a monitoring device
during implementation and would be updated by the implementation staff of the
NTB secretariat and the PTBs.
5.02       Administration/Organization.  The project would be carried out by
implementation and management capacity in the existing system rather than
creating a separate Project Implementation Unit. The organization would com-
prise a National Training Board (NTB) at the federal level, and four Provincial
Training Boards (PTBs). The existing National Training Bureau in the Ministry
of Labor would function as the secretariat of the NTB, and become the federal
unit responsible for overall coordination of project activities and liaison
with the Association. The Provincial Labor Departments would be strengthened,



- 33 -
and would function as the Secretariats of the PTBs. However, implementation
of the project would become the responsibility of the Provincial Labor Depart-
ments. Annex 5 shows the organization and functional responsibilities of the
various agencies involved.
5.03      The Provincial Labor Departments would be responsible for the
educational and training aspects of the project in its initial phase. How-
ever, as NTDI staff is recruited and strengthened by the foreign and local
experts financed by the UNDP (para 3.22), these responsibilities will devolve
to the NTDI. The NTDI would be headed by a Director and will consist of
five departments based on educational and training requirements (para 3.07).
5.04      Duties and Responsibilities of the National Training Bureau (NTB
Secretariat). The Secretariat of the NTB would coordinate training and imple-
mentation activities of the PTBs. Specifically, the NTB responsibilities
would include:
(a) coordinating the activities of all public and private
agencies associated with the project;
(b) organizing international procurement of equipment in
cooperation with the ILO (Equipro) and the PTBs;
(c) organizing and adminstering technical assistance and
fellowship programs (financed by UNDP/ILO);
(d) monitoring progress of the PTB activities;
(e) transferring project funds to the PTB;
(f) maintaining project accounts;
(g) maintaining liaison with IDA (including preparation of
Quarterly Progress Reports); and
(h) preparing withdrawal applications.
5.05      Duties and Responsibilities of the NTDI would include:
(a) developing curricula;
(b) setting skill standards;
(c) evaluating training methodology and delivery systems;
(d) carrying out job analysis; and
(e) organizing courses for instructors, senior staff and in-
plant training staff.



- 34 -
5.06      Duties and Responsibilities of the Provincial Labor Departments
(PTB Secretariats) would include:
(a) briefing architectural designers (PWD);
(b) preparing (in consultation with the NTB, the experts and
recipient institutions) master lises of equipment and
furniture;
(c) preparing and reviewing project reports, plans, speci-
fications and other material related to each province;
(d) inviting and evaluating bids and awards for civil works,
local equipment, furniture and training materials;
(e) supervising construction of buildings and delivery and
installation of equipment and furniture;
(f) transferring funds to project institutions and maintaining
project accounts; and
(g) submitting documents needed to support withdrawal appli-
cations to the NTB Secretariat.
5.07      Architectural Services and Designs.  The Public Works Departments
in the provinces have in the past prepared designs for vocational training
centers which are reasonably functional but with certain design deficiencies.
It is therefore recommended that prototype designs for the new centers be
developed by a competent private firm of consultants (local or expatriate)
with specific experience in the design of vocational training facilities.
During negotiations the Government provided an assurance that it would send
to the Association for review and approval by December 31, 1981, preliminary
prototype designs and workshop layouts for new centers and preliminary designs
for the NTDI. Subsequent preparation of working drawings and tender documents,
tendering and supervision could be handled by the PWD. Minor supplemental
architectural and engineering designs would be prepared with the assistance of
local consultants.
5.08      IDA Review and Approval.  Master equipment and furniture lists,
equipment specifications, fellowship programs, TOR of experts, site layout
plans and preliminary designs for civil works, draft tender and contract
documents and cost estimates, on their completion would be reviewed and
approved by the Association. Review of bid evaluation documents and Bor-
rower' s recommendations would be required prior to the award of civil works
contracts exceeding US$200,000 equivalent and for any contracts for equipment,
learning materials, furniture, building materials and consumable training
materials, exceeding US$50,000 equivalent.
5.09      Construction.  Construction of the civil works component would be
undertaken by private contractors. Only prequalified contractors would be
allowed to bid for civil works contracts under this project.



- 35 -
5.10      Sites.  Sites for all of the new institutions have been acquired in
accordance with criteria acceptable to the Association.
Procurement
Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) (US$36.95 million) 1/
5.11      Civil Works and Furniture (US$24.92 million).  Past experience in
Pakistan has shown that contracts for civil works and furniture do not attract
foreign bidders, unless they are substantially in excess of US$500,000.
Therefore, contracts for civil works and furniture would be awarded on the
basis of competitive bidding advertised locally following procedures satis-
factory to the Association. Foreign contractors would be allowed to partici-
pate if they express an interest in doing so.
5.12      Equipment (US$2.62 million).  Contracts that cannot be grouped into
packages-for bulk procurement of at least US$50,000, not exceeding in the
aggregate US$2.62 million (equivalent to about 20% of the estimated total cost
of equipment would be procured in accordance with local competitive bidding
procedures satisfactory to the Association.
5.13      Learning materials (US$0.30 million) mostly printed matter, would be
procured in accordance with standard government procedures, on the basis of
competitive bidding.
5.14      Consumable training materials (US$9.11 million).  Timely delivery of
consumable materials is very critical, therefore, such materials would be
procured locally on the basis of competitive bidding by each institution,
separately, to avoid the complicated logistics of mass procurement.
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) (US$12.47 million)
5.15      Equipment (US$10.47 million).  Contracts exceeding US$50,000 equi-
valent would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank Group guidelines. Local manufacturers would receive a
margin of preference in bid evaluation of 15% of the c.i.f. price of competing
imports or the actual customs duty, whichever is lower.
Prudent Shopping (Local and International) (US$2.0 million)
5.16      Off-the-shelf-items of, equipment, furniture, consumable training
materials and learning materials, (special items, spares, etc.) not exceeding
US$20,000, equivalent for each contract and aggregating a maximum of US$2.00
million (equivalent to about 10% of the estimated total cost of equipment
furniture consumable training materials and learning materials), could be
purchased on the basis of a minimum of three competitive price quotations.
1/   This and subsequent statements are estimates including contingencies.



- 36 -
Association Review
5.17      Prior approval of the Association would be required for the award
of any civil works contract exceeding US$200,000 equivalent and for any equip-
ment, furniture, consumable training materials, and learning materials, con-
tracts exceeding US$50,000.
Disbursements
5.18      The proposed credit of US$25.00 million would finance 60% of the
total project costs, net of customs duties and taxes. The proceeds of the
proposed IDA credit would finance:
(a) 100% of the c.i.f. cost of directly imported equipment;
(b) 100% of the ex-factory price of locally manufactured
equipment;
(c) 100% of the cost of consultant services;
(d) 80% of the cost of equipment procured locally;
(e) 45% of expenditures on incremental staff salaries and
consumable training materials; and
(f) 40% of expenditures on civil works, furniture and
related professional fees for design and supervision
services.
5.19      Documentation.  Withdrawal applications would be supported by full
documentation, except for expenditures on salaries and consumable training
materials which would be reimbursed against statements of expenditures signed
by the Project Director. Documentation for these statements would be retained
by the project unit and be available for review by IDA during project super-
vision missions. To the extent practicable, withdrawal applications would be
aggregated in amounts of US$50,000 or more prior to submission to the Asso-
ciation for reimbursement out of the proceeds of the proposed credit. Undis-
bursed funds could be used with the approval of the Association for other
project-related components. The percentages of (c), (d), and (e) above would
be adjusted as necessary to spread disbursement over the estimated project
implementation period. A forecast of expenditures and disbursements is shown
in Annex 7.
5.20      Project Accounts and Audits.  Project expenditures would be recorded
in accordance with sound accounting practices. Accounts and financial state-
ments for each fiscal year would be audited by competent auditors acceptable
to the Association. During negotiations the Government gave assurances that
it would carry out an annual audit satisfactory to IDA of the accounts of the
National Training Board, the Provincial Training Boards and the National
Training Development Institute, and would furnish to IDA as soon as available,
but not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year: (i) certi-
fied copies of the consolidated financial statements of accounts of these
agencies; and (ii) an auditor's report of these accounts.

VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
6.01      The proposed project would form an integral part of the Government's
strategy to expand vocational training and produce the skilled manpower needed
for industrial development and for the replacement of skilled workers emigrating
to the Middle East. Project institutions (GVIs and TTCs) would help to accel-
erate the output of skilled and semiskilled workers, which would benefit the
Government in the implementation of its development projects. This would in
turn increase production in the industrial and manufacturing sectors by achiev-
ing a higher ratio of skilled workers to unskilled workers, thereby reducing
the need for extensive ad hoc on-the-job training. The industrial sector would
also benefit from the program for in-plant training and upgrading of unskilled
workers. In addition, an increase in skilled workers would enable the country
to capitalize (through foreign exchange remittances) on Middle East employment
opportunities without disrupting domestic production, project implementation
and productivity.
6.02      The proposed project represents a less expensive scheme than the
Government's original investment program for vocational training (para 2.10).
In 1985 when project-financed facilities would be fully operational, the total
direct annual output from the expanded system would be about 20,000 skilled
and semi-skilled workers (Table 6.1) in 18 different occupations in the con-
struction, electrical and mechanical fields. The indirect output from in-plant
training would be an additional 10,000 comprising some 2,200 apprentices and
8,000 production workers. By 1985, project training would account for 90% of
total output from the government's institutional vocational training system
and would meet about 46% of the total estimated domestic skilled manpower
requirements for the non-agricultural sectors. The balance would be provided
through non-project vocational training institutes and private institutions.
6.03      A major benefit of the project would be the better quality of train-
ing given graduates entering the job market. The project would establish
training standards developed with the participation of industrial employers
hence making training more relevant. The quality of training would be further
enhanced by funds provided under the project for consumable training materials
to foster practical rather than theoretical instruction; and incremental staff
salaries to ensure that sufficient instructors of the requisite quality are
trained and employed. The project would institute a shorter, six-month modular-
type course, a system which is both cost effective and practical in Pakistan.
The proposed coordination of institutional training with in-plant schemes
would reinforce this practical orientation.

/b   Estimate of number of skilled/semi-skilled workers upgraded through

6.04      The project would also have significant institutional benefits.  The
creation of a National Training Board, Provincial Training Boards, a National
Training Development Institute and an In-Plant Training Advisory Service would
help to ensure national coordination, avoid duplication of programs, thereby
enabling a more efficient use of resources. They would also assist Pakistan's
planning capability, foster the standardization of qualifications throughout
the system and promote the evaluation of both institutional and in-plant voca-
tional training. The Project would benefit vocational training in general
by strengthening training institutions through assistance to the Provincial
Labor Departments in the supervision and administration of TTCs and GVIs.
Risks
6.05      Problems are possible in the recruitment and retention of qualified
instructors. The salary incentive package for instructors (para 3.13) should
attract suitably qualified personnel from industry, but alternative and more
financially beneficial employment opportunities still exist in the Middle
East. The appointment of suitably qualified staff would therefore be closely
supervised and remedial action (e.g. increasing the output from instructor
training programs) recommended should shortages develop.



- 39 -
6.06      In an effort to improve the quality of training, the project would
finance expenditure for consumable training materials for five years. The
Government would be required to include in the PC-1 budgetary provision,
including foreign exchange, to cover its share of these costs during the
project life. The risk remains that the Provincial Governments might not
provide sufficient funds for training materials after the project is completed,
particularly if the shortage of resources remains critical. However, the
National Training Board through The National Training Board Fund could assist
the Provinces in overcoming these potential shortages. Despite these risks,
it is believed that the benefits realized through increased domestic industrial
production and workers' remittances from abroad would be sufficient motivation
for Government to allocate adequate funds to project facilities so that they
operate effectively.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED
7.01      During negotiations, the Association and the Government agreed on:
(a) the staffing pattern and annual budgetary provisions for
the National and Provincial Training Boards and the NTDI
