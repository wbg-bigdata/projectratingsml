WESTERN SAVANNAH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - II
(Cr. 1640 - SU)
PREFACE
1.                  This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Western
Savannah Development Project - Phase II in Sudan, for which Credit 1640 in the amount of SDR
10.2 million (US$ 10.6 million equivalent) was approved on December 3, 1985 and became
effective on November 26, 1986.
2.                  The credit was closed on June 30, 1993, compared with the original
closing date of June 30 1992. Final disbursement took place on November 1, 1993. at which
time a balance of SDR 2.64 million (US$ 3.7 million equivalent) was cancelled. Co-financing
for the project was provided by IFAD and ODA.
3.                  The ICRI/ was prepared by staff of FAO/CP and of the Agriculture and
Environment Division of the Eastern Africa Department (AF2AE); it was reviewed by Ms. S.
Ganguly, Division Chief, AF2AE, and Mr. G. Tata, Acting Projects Adviser, AF2. The report
is based on material in the project files as well as findings of the FAO/CP 's ICR mission in the
field. The project authorities contributed to the preparation of the ICR by providing comments,
contributing views reflected in the mission's aide-memoire, and preparing their own evaluation
of the project's execution which is available in the project files.
1/ The Implementation Completion Report was modified to reflect the input of various
Bank staff who reviewed the draft report prepared by FAO/CP, and may not mirror the
FAO/CP Completion Mission's assessment of the project's performance, sustainability
and lessons of experience.

WESTERN SAVANNAH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - II
(Cr. 1640 - SU)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES
1.                 Between 1975 and 1985, IDA extended 21 Credits to Sudan for its
agricultural sector, totalling about US$ 0.5 billion. Three quarters of these funds were devoted
to irrigation projects. The Western Sudan Agricultural Research Project (Kordofan) and the
Western Savannah Project - Phase I (WSDP-I -- South Darfur), which became effective in 1980
and 1981 respectively, were the first projects to address the challenge of enhancing production
and reversing erosion in the Sahelian zone of Sudan.
2.                  The Western Savannah Development Project, Phase II (WSDP-II), aimed
at using the results of the above two projects to arrest land degradation and feed a rapidly
increasing population. The project strategy assumed that land utilization could be improved
through the provision of suitably sited wells and settlements with fixed land tenure and that
sustainable farming practices would be used. The main thrust of the project was directed at the
rehabilitation of existing, and installation of new wateryards, a settlement program, and
supporting animal health and extension components designed to raise production and incomes.
Other components included range improvement, forestry, road construction, and support to two
agricultural research stations. The project was declared effective in November 1986 (planned
date: May 1986), and closed in June 1993, one year later than estimated at appraisal.
3.                  Following the Mid-Term Review of the project, priority was shifted from
the environmental activities, which were experiencing major implementation delays and
sustainability problems, to activities aimed at increasing production and farm incomes. Major
covenants covered land tenure policy and cooperation between the main implementing institution,
WSDC, and the line implementing agencies (Part II, Table 10); they were generally complied
with, albeit after some delay.
4.                  Total project costs are estimated at US$ 48.3 million ($43.8 million at
appraisal). IDA contributed the equivalent of US$ 10.1 million; (SDR 2.64 million of the original
credit of SDR 10.2 million were cancelled when the credit was closed). IFAD contributed about
US$ 12.7 million ( SDR 9.1 million of the original loan of SDR 9.45 million, the remaining SDR
0.35 million was cancelled). ODA contributed about US$ 13 million, and Government the
equivalent of US$ 12.5 million (Part II, Table 8B).
IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS
5.                  The environmental goals of arresting land degradation and replacing
shifting cultivation with a more productive and sustainable agriculture were not achieved; a
sustainable water supply system with full cost recovery could not be realized; the settlement
program was also halted because of high costs and lack of evidence of sustainability. The
production objectives were mostly attained through an increase in area cultivated, rather than



-iii-
through the introduction of a more sustainable farming system (as originally envisaged).
However, some noteworthy achievements of the project were as follows: the development of a
donkey plough, which relieved a serious labour constraint and allowed a fast expansion in area
cultivated; the introduction, on-farm testing, and multiplication of some drought tolerant varieties
of sorghum, millet and groundnut; and some improvement in animal health through vaccinations
(the actual vaccination rate of 30 percent, is significantly below the appraisal target of 90 percent)
and the partial privatization of drug distribution. Quantifiable benefits from the project are
expected to yield an ERR of 18 percent compared with the SAR estimate of 35 percent. The
project was also successful in establishing a number of women's societies, which were the vehicle
for adult/child literacy and adult vocational and nutrition training. On the basis of these
achievements the project could be rated as marginally satisfactory; however, in view of its
primary objectives not being realized, overall project performance is rated unsatisfactory.
6.                   The key constraints experienced during implementation originate in:
weaknesses in the assumptions and design of the strategy adopted for the environmental objectives
of the project; the complexity of the project together with the excessive number of (weak)
implementing agencies; insufficient coordination among co-financiers; and the economic
difficulties of the country. Furthermore, the failure of the settlement, water and land improvement
components illustrates the high costs of inadequate planning and analysis and of insufficient
beneficiary participation in design and implementation. Some of the ingredients in the successful
activities of the project, were: active and helpful guidance from supervision missions as well as
strong Government support; improved technical and institutional capacity at WSDC and in the
regional animal health services; and effective technical assistance inputs with respect to on-farm
research and animal-drawn implements.
7.                   IDA performance during appraisal and the early part of implementation
was inadequate in addressing major institutional and technical constraints and issues. Thereafter,
it worked hard to achieve good results out of a complex project facing serious difficulties.
Government performance also improved after the initial stage when recruitments were frozen and
actions were slow. Weak funding of collaborating agencies and lack of attention to coordination
issues have however been constant problems.
8.                   Those project activities where the private sector has been involved (farm
implements, drug distribution) or where cost recovery mechanisms have been introduced
(vaccines, seed multiplication), are expected to be sustainable over the coming years. Water
supply benefits are likely to decline unless beneficiary participation is mobilized and the local
councils are effective. The project components related to range and pasture improvements,
rehabilitation of forestry and rangelands, support of the Naga'a cultivation, strengthening adaptive
research, upgrading of the Agricultural Extension Department and other institutional
strengthening, were either only marginally fruitful, or stymied altogether; their sustainability is
moot. Hence, overall project sustainability is uncertain.
FINDINGS, FUTURE OPERATIONS AND KEY LESSONS
9.                   The project implementation capacity and experience developed under
phase I were an asset to the project. The considerably wider scope and complex design of Phase-
II, with too many financiers and implementing agencies, resulted in a difficult start and long
delays in implementation. WSDC has emerged strengthened from these difficulties and stands
now as the only agency capable of planning and coordinating rural development in Darfur. As
such, it is likely to receive support from the State government and continue its task.



-iv-
10.                  The project illustrates both the difficulties and importance of matching
instruments to objectives.  Its discrete and focussed "project approach" was successful in
introducing new technology (the donkey-plough and new crop varieties) which met specific
constraints of the beneficiaries and brought immediate and obvious benefits. On the other hand,
the coordination and implementation delays illustrate the inapplicability of this approach to major
institutional and capacity constraints in the public sector.  A wider"program" approach to
rationalization and improvement of regional institutions and coordination mechanisms would have
been a more sustainable approach. An area development project was also not the appropriate
instrument for addressing problems of national scope such as the reform of water policies and
institutions. Furthermore, the Bank missions appeared to Government to have been heavily
oriented towards administrative matters, and often lacking the technical expertise required to
focus the PMU on what was essential to meet the project objectives. Supervision missions with
a balanced staff composition/ skill mix, could have contributed to a more successful project
performance.
11.                  The failure of the settlement, water and land improvement components
illustrates the high costs of inadequate planning and analysis and of insufficient beneficiary
participation in design and implementation. It is also an indication of the difficulties of linking
broad, long-term environmental goals to communities (or agencies) with other more immediate
and pressing concerns.

WESTERN SAVANNAH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - II
(Cr. 1640-SU)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. OBJECTIVES
1.                  The Western Savannah Development Project Phase II (WSDP-II), aimed
at raising the standards of living of a rapidly increasing population, while arresting land
degradation resulting from an influx of refugees from the drought-stricken northern regions.
These broad objectives were relevant to the region, sector and country but elements of the project
strategy were based on weak assumptions. The project scope also proved too ambitious for
implementation capacity and its design exacerbated institutional and organizational weaknesses.
2.                  The project strategy entailed the development of a more productive and
sustainable form of agriculture to replace shifting cultivation, the improvement of animal health,
rangelands and pasture, and the utilization of idle, fertile land through the rehabilitation of
wateryards and the cultivation of heavy soils by tractors. The strategy to halt and reverse land
degradation was based on the assumption that a controlled settlement process and soil fertility
raising practices would avoid the rapid exhaustion of fragile soils that were being experienced
with shifting cultivation.
3.                  While the rationale for organized settlements remains a subject of intense
debate, the SAR failed to acknowledge the technical risks related to unproven technologies and
underestimated the institutional difficulties involved in obtaining support from the national
research system. The proposed yield raising techniques had not been sufficiently tested by
WSDP-I, while those aimed at improving soil fertility, including fallow improvement and ley
farming, had not even been tried in the project area.
4.                  The water supply component envisaged the rehabilitation of 54
wateryards, the installation of 15 new wateryards, and the establishment of a comprehensive
maintenance program based on the rapid achievement of full cost recovery for all 233 wateryards
in the project area. A small haffir (ponds) program was also envisaged to serve nomadic
communities in grazing areas where aquifers are difficult to locate.  These targets proved
unrealistic in the light of: the weaknesses and poor linkages among the coordinating and
implementing agencies and other local governmental authorities; little or no participation of the
beneficiaries in planning and maintenance; other weaknesses in Government's water policies,
including a reluctance to raise charges or seek cost-reducing approaches.
5.                  A major weakness in the original design of the project was its neglect of
obvious institutional issues. The first phase project had achieved a certain degree of success in
wateryard rehabilitation and installation, adaptive research, extension and veterinary services
(mainly supply of seeds, fertilizers and veterinary inputs), and road, bridges and culvert
construction and rehabilitation through an autonomous agency, Western Savannah Development
Corporation (WSDC). In some activities, WSDC had taken a lead role in implementation while



-2-
for others it had provided inputs, materials or financing to other government agencies. The
considerably wider scope of WSDP-II created major coordination problems and institutional
resistance from line agencies to the expanding role and power of WSDC. It appears to have been
assumed at appraisal that the large provisions for external Technical Assistance (TA) would
overcome not only the technological but also the institutional weaknesses. Only the settlement
component appears to have received adequate attention to institutional issues at appraisal.
Unfortunately, the recommendations on training of local leaders and beneficiary participation
were ignored or delayed during implementation.
6.                   The original objectives and scope of the project proved too ambitious and
were revised in 1988, following a difficult start. Although the long term land conservation goal
was not explicitly discarded, land use planning and fixed tenure were no longer seen as central
to land improvement. The creation of new settlements was halted and priority was given to the
generation and extension of new technology to benefit the majority of farmers.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
Physical Objectives
7.                   The project achieved most of its physical objectives for water
development. It rehabilitated all 54 wateryards envisaged at appraisal but was able to construct
only 6 new ones as compared to the appraisal target of 15. The project erected or replaced 30
new water tanks. An effective maintenance program however, has not been achieved and the
overall condition of wateryards in the project area has deteriorated during project implementation,
as shown by the decline in annual output from 550 million gallons in 1985/86 to 450 million
gallons in 1993/94. Without the project, output would probably have been only 220 million
gallons.
8.                   The roads improvement program  was only partially implemented;
achievements included only 13 bridges (SAR estimate 24); 12 culverts (SAR estimate 6) and 6
km of raised earth embankments (SAR estimate 37 km). The buildings program was more
successful.  The project constructed 71 buildings including staff living quarters, office
accommodation, clinics, schools, a training centre and laboratories; part of the program was a
carry-over from phase I; the phase II program (24 buildings) was 85 percent completed at project
closing. A total of 93 vehicles were procured including 22 trucks and 56 pick-ups (target numbers
not shown in SAR). Until 1992 when the security in the project area improved, the occasional
commandeering of project vehicles by security forces was a problem.
Development Objectives
9.                   The project was able to achieve important development objectives even
though most of the agricultural technologies developed under phase I were not adopted2/. The
major achievement was the thriving development of animal drawn implements, particularly the
2/  Phosphatic fertilizer was not economically attractive in low rainfall years, thus risky; improved seeds
of the then available varieties were not conspicuously outperforming farmers' cultivars, and rigid
rotations offered little improvement to compensate for the added constraints. Seed dressing, using an
organochlorine (Aldrex), which effectively protected groundnut seeds and seedlings against soil insects,
was well accepted, but the product was banned in 1990 and no good replacement found since.



-3-
donkey plough, of which about 7,000 are reportedly produced annually by local blacksmiths
trained by the project. The project has also successfully introduced and disseminated a number
of short duration varieties of: sorghum (2); millet (2); and groundnut (1); all of which are
generally more drought tolerant than the local varieties. Although the impact of these
developments is still relatively modest, new promising varieties are in the pipeline, and the
capacity has been established for on-farm testing and extension of technology, including seed
multiplication.
10.                  The settlement program proved more difficult and costly than originally
envisaged. The pilot concept (started in Phase I) was expanded without sufficient analysis of
availability of suitable land or evidence of sustainability. The appraisal target of eleven new
settlements was reduced to the establishment of two new villages and support to the four
established under phase I. Beneficiaries express their appreciation of the facilities offered (water
supply, schools and other social services) and their adherence to the settlement philosophy; but
the sustainability test will only come when farmers return to the first cultivated blocks, after a
15-year fallow. In fact, the work on soil fertility conservation, for which the settlements were
to serve as laboratories, has hardly started.
11.                  The cultivation of heavy soils (naga'a) has not expanded since the mid
1980s, despite the procurement of new tractors and ploughing equipment. Privatization of tractor
services has started, but work on suitable practices for those soils has not been undertaken and
yields remain insufficient to ensure good returns.
12.                  The range and pasture improvement program  has succeeded in
establishing a capacity for forage seed production and has identified a number of potential forage
strategies, including community managed enclosures, fallow improvement and fodder banks,
together with suitable forage species. Forage seed production is probably sustainable. For the
other strategies however, much time was lost before initiating action, testing was limited to very
few sites and adoption is still embryonic. These important and promising strategies have not
reached the credibility stage that would ensure further sufficient financing and sustainability.
13.                  Animal Health. With project support, the Veterinary Services have more
than maintained their coverage of vaccinations on an animal population that has increased by over
50 percent during implementation.  Although the total number of vaccinations has not
significantly increased since the end of phase I, the level of immunization against the main cattle
diseases (Rinderpest and CBPP) was raised from 55-60 percent ten years ago to about 70 percent
at project closing, which was possible essentially through a better outreach program. The
proposed privatization has been successful, with 15 private practices now selling drugs and
services. The project has also constructed and equipped a diagnostic laboratory, and installed a
vaccine production facility which started operations in 1993/94; this is expected to alleviate the
recurrent shortages experienced so far.
Economic Benefits
14.                  The estimated quantifiable costs and benefits arising from the project are
set out in Table 9. These show that the project is expected to attain an ERR of 18 percent, or 17
percentage points lower than the appraisal estimate. The benefits under the project are largely
attributable to the increase in on-farm production because of extension efforts at low incremental
on-farm costs, assisted by the fairly wide-spread adoption of the donkey plough (designed and
promoted by the project) which is transforming local agriculture by allowing farmers to expand



-4-
cultivated areas without labor constraints. Additionally, benefits have accrued from the animal
health component, particularly vaccinations. The economic benefits from the water program are
difficult to estimate because of lack of monitoring of pertinent data by the Project Management
Unit (PMU). Estimates have been made by the ICR mission using more conservative parameters
than the SAR's, given the lack of reliability of water supply. In the latter years of the project,
the incremental benefit from water has been linearly reduced to reflect the likely deterioration in
the state of the wateryards due to poor maintenance and failure to replace old wells.
15.                  Although precise data is not available, the project has contributed to
creating jobs in the project area both on farms and off-farm in the formal and informal sectors
through linkages with project activities. The water improvement program has improved the
proximity, quantity and quality of water available to the human and animal populations, thus
improving their health. The project also helped (through a Women's Affairs Unit) to establish
women's societies in the settlements and a few extension villages. These societies were the
vehicles for adult literacy training, establishment of kindergartens, training for women in the
manufacture of soap and cheese, handicrafts, needlework, awareness of nutritional standards and
improved food preparation. Small ruminant and poultry development were initiated just before
project closing.
C. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
General
16.                  The project experienced major difficulties in its two first years due to
institutional and capacity constraints, some of which arose from the design flaws mentioned
above. There were frequent changes in the staff of WSDC -- the main implementing agency and
delays in filling positions. Coordination with other agencies was a major problem and the central
authorities were slow (or failed altogether) to intervene to resolve inter-agency conflicts and
bottlenecks. In 1988, WSDC was restructured, a new management team was put in place, and
project objectives were simplified. It took two more years for the new team to reach full control
of its task and as a result, most activities witnessed major delays in implementation.
Technical Assistance
17.                  Technical assistance was generally not effective.  First, there was a
general feeling among senior Sudanese project staff that TA was not necessary, or if needed, the
expertise was available locally. Secondly, largely because of the remoteness of the project area,
the best quality of expatriate staff could not always be attracted. Many of those who were
eventually recruited stayed for very short periods and left. This led to a very high turnover of
TA staff, 30 persons filling 18 posts. This rapid turnover meant that most TA staff were not able
to leave a lasting benefit or impact to the project. Finally, different policies from the two groups
of financiers (IDA/IFAD and ODA) resulted in the recruitment of TA consultants from two
different firms which engaged in rivalry, each one trying to undermine the other. The number
of TA staff and the divisions where they served are shown in Part II, Table 5. By contrast, the
hiring of two well qualified TA consultants, one for short annual periods during several years,
and the other one for a period of three years, was decisive for the success of two outstanding
achievements of the project: the on-farm research program and the development of animal
traction.



-5-
Training
18.                 The training program as set out at appraisal was generally fulfilled with
the exception of the 3 - 6 month courses group where there was a large shortfall in numbers
trained (see Part II, Table 5). The shortfall is attributable to a temporary decision taken by GOS
in 1990 and rescinded two years later which discouraged Sudanese from going on studies
overseas. Had it not been for that interruption, most of the training would have been completed
by the time the IDA credit was closed. About 60 persons obtained training outside Sudan in
diverse fields including extension, engineering, animal production, women in development and
management. So far 15 of the staff trained have left the project for other employment. A
training centre is nearing completion at the project headquarters in Nyala. The centre will be
mainly used to train trainers for WSDC as well as for trainees from other agencies who will be
charged a fee.
Agricultural Development & Settlement
19.                 Initial dissensions about the development strategy envisaged in the SAR
led to a dispersion of efforts, with each team pursuing independently its own objectives.
Subsequent changes in TA staff and the sending of key WSDC staff on external training programs
further disrupted the activities. After 1988, as discussed above, the settlement program was
reduced to establishment of two new villages with adequate land, infrastructure and services.
Farmers' interest for the Naga'a (heavy soils) program receded when ploughing fees were raised
to reflect real costs. Research to improve cultivation of these soils has received low priority and
has failed to provide any improvements for farmers. As a result, total area under the program
has remained at the mid-80's level of about 2,000 ha and it is not clear that the privatization of
ploughing services under the project will contribute to further expansion.
20.                  WSDC was intended to have direct extension responsibilities only over
the settlements areas, while providing support and guidance to the Agricultural Extension
Department (AED) for general extension. Cooperation with the weak and poorly funded AED
never materialized, and WSDC gradually developed its own extension network, niow covering
122 villages and 17 Women's Centres, and employing over 200 persons. The extension staff
were initially mobilized in the dissemination of WSDP-I technology, and were engaged in
supplying TSP and other inputs; they have been since successfully re-trained to implement the
on-farm testing program and extend its results.
21.                  Despite efforts of the PMU and supervision missions to operationalize the
agreement made with Agricultural Research Corporation (ARC) for adaptive research, no
contribution was ever obtained from the two regional stations which ARC failed to revive (one
was taken over by the Ministry of Animal Resources, the other barely staffed and still non-
operational). Initial research efforts by WSDC focused on rotations and soil fertility, for which
it was ill-equipped. A new direction was taken after 1989 under the able guidance of a visiting
agronomist who helped in selecting and supplying genetic material, mostly from
Nigeria/ICRISAT, as well as in planning on-farm testing of the improved varieties.
22.                  The animal health component was implemented by the State Veterinary
Department (SVD), with WSDC providing for the purchase of drugs and vaccines by the
Veterinary Central Administration (VCA) in Khartoum, as well as vehicles and equipment. The
cooperation with SVD has proved satisfactory. However, drug procurement by VCA has been
the subject of much controversy, and shortages (particularly for tripanocydal drugs) have



-6-
occurred almost constantly. The issue seems finally resolved, and the revolving fund established
by the project for drug supply now functions well. Similar shortages in vaccines have been partly
alleviated through the cooperation with the EU funded Pan-African Rinderpest Campaign
(PARC). Vaccinations have not increased according to the optimistic SAR projections. As full
cost recovery has been introduced, cattle owners want to maximize the pay-off, and limit
vaccinations to young animals, except during disease outbreaks.
23.                  Privatization of veterinary practices has met with stiff resistance from the
central authority, but a total of 15 have been established in the main centres as essentially private
pharmacies. The project has also upgraded the State laboratory facilities, and established a
vaccine production unit just before credit closing. The vaccine unit had been delayed by concerns
about viability and procurement problems.
24.                  The PMU also embarked on a genetic improvement program involving
the distribution of a few dozens Kenana bulls and anglo-riubian goats, of a few thousand chicks,
and the establishment of a small Al service. These developments were not envisaged at appraisal,
nor were they encouraged by supervision missions until 1991, but they have certainly distracted
efforts from the more important feed improvement activities.
25.                  The range & pasture program had a relatively good start which was
interrupted by TA changes and staff training. The basic pre-requisite, a well established seed
multiplication capacity, has only been in place since 1993; the scheme is operated by WSDC (the
envisaged contract farmer scheme failed, most likely due to unattractive seed prices being offered
by the project). A commendable work of field testing of various forage strategies and species has
been undertaken, but only late due to these delays, and few tangible results are available yet.
Improvement of open range has not been successful and was discontinued. Nearly all of the
3,000 kms of firelines envisaged at appraisal were constructed.
Infrastructure Component
26.                  Water.   Considerable delays were experienced  in starting  the
rehabilitation program due to poor relationship with the implementing agency, NRWC, slow
procurement, and the need for a thorough reassessment of the equipment needed, when it was
realized that the condition of many boreholes was worse than evaluated at appraisal. NRWC
capacity for implementation was weakened by the curtailment of central funding which was
redirected to provinces that received no external funding. Water rates, which are decided in
Khartoum, were raised several times, following IDA's intervention, but these increases never
fully compensated for inflation. Because of poor funding, weak management and low staff
incentives, NRWC was only able to carry out the planned rehabilitation program as well as some
emergency repairs, but failed to establish a proper maintenance system.  As a result, the
condition of the 150 wateryards rehabilitated under phase I (and, later, of the 50 rehabilitated
since) has degraded, as evidenced by the falling total water output.
27.                  The haffir program was delayed and eventually reduced. Mobilizing local
labor proved impractical (no provision was made for incentives, such as food for work); and
mobilizing and transporting heavy equipment over long distances proved difficult and too
expensive.
28.                  The construction program proceeded smoothly after the completion in
1988 of the phase I program, which had been delayed by the suspension of funding from the



-7-
Saudi Fund (because of arrears). Both IDA and IFAD agreed to reallocate funds to partly
compensate for the shortfall. The road component suffered again from poor collaboration with
the Road and Public Bridges Corporation (RPBC), the implementing agency. Delays in initiating
the work lead the Mid-Term Review mission to cancel the procurement of heavy equipment.
Irish bridges and culverts were constructed with RPBC equipment, while the 6 kms of raised
earth embankment were done with equipment on hire from Jebel Mara Project.
Monitoring and Evaluation
29.                 The Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Division (PMED) of WSDC
was supported by the project through funding of incremental costs including the cost of 3 TA
staff (one at a time) who served in the division between 1987 and 1993. Inspite of this support,
the department remains weak, particularly after last year when it lost its national head who was
reportedly well-trained and competent. Besides carrying out periodic market surveys, pre and
post-harvest surveys and a baseline survey (code-named Clearline by WSDC), PMED also
contributed to the 1992 study on the future of WSDC and more recently prepared a completion
report of the project. However, the latter appears to have been compiled largely by the last TA
consultant. After his departure, no one in the department is able to explain the key parameters
and bases used, particularly those relating to the cost/benefit analysis in the report.
Project Costs and Financing
30.                 As shown in Table 8A, project costs are estimated to be in the region of
US$ 48.3 million which is US$ 4.5 million or about 10 percent in excess of appraisal estimate
in dollar terms. PMU report their expenditure by categories according to the Credit/Loan
agreements.  Data on component-wise breakdown of project costs is therefore not readily
available.
31.                 IDA contributed the equivalent of US$ 10.1 million, about US$ 0.5
million less than estimated at appraisal. IFAD and ODA contributed the equivalent of US$ 12.7
million and US$ 13.0 million respectively which is substantially in excess of their appraisal
pledges of US$ 9.9 million for IFAD and US$ 10.7 million for ODA. ODA stopped funding the
project from January 1991. The relatively high contributions in dollar terms are due to the
appreciation against the dollar by the SDR and the Pound Sterling. About SDR 2.6 million or
26 percent of the IDA Credit was cancelled when the Credit was closed. SDR 9.1 million of the
IFAD Loan was disbursed and the remaining SDR 0.35 million was cancelled. GOS contributed
the equivalent of US$ 12.5 million which is almost equal to the appraisal estimates, an apparent
illustration of its strong commitment to this project.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
32.                 The main benefits of the project resulted from improved animal drawn
implements, animal health, new varieties of cereals and groundnuts, and water supply. Hence,
those project activities where the private sector has been involved (farm implements, drug
distribution) or where cost recovery mechanisms have been introduced (vaccines, seed
multiplication), are expected to be sustainable over the coming years. The improved implements
are serviced and manufactured by private blacksmiths trained by the project, using locally
available material. The capacity of the veterinary services and of herders to maintain or further
improve animal health is now stronger, in particular through: full cost recovery and a revolving



-8-
fund which is now operational; vaccine production; and privatization. Private pharmacies now
sell more volumes than the public sector, and the Veterinary Assistants trained by the project are
paid by communities.  The seed multiplication scheme using contract farmers should be
sustainable, provided remunerative prices are maintained, and provided WSDC continues to
operate.
33.                  While WSDC will not retain the level of funding it enjoyed during
implementation, PMU is exploring ways of reducing dependency on GOS funding through
increased cost recovery, through tapping local Government resources and through holding training
courses for outsiders for a fee. But the funds raised from these sources are likely to be limited.
Institutional sustainability, for both WSDC and the Veterinary Services is also threatened by the
likelihood of senior staff resigning their posts because of funding uncertainty and the attraction
of getting higher paying jobs elsewhere.
34.                  Although the overall condition of wateryards has worsened during
implementation, their deterioration would have been faster without project. The benefits from
the water supply program may be short-lived, as cost recovery has not improved, the installed
equipment is not maintained, and the capacity of NRWC to service or rehabilitate wateryards has
not improved. The hopes now placed on local Councils to improve O&M and to raise sufficient
funding for repairs may prove overly optimistic. It is likely that a growing number of wateryards
will soon be unserviceable and will need again rehabilitation or replacement unless the
beneficiaries are encouraged to assume greater responsibility for this service. Additionally, the
project components related to range and pasture improvements, rehabilitation of forestry and
rangelands, support of the Naga'a cultivation, strengthening adaptive research, upgrading of the
Agricultural Extension Department and other institutional strengthening, were either only
marginally fruitful, or stymied altogether; their sustainability is moot. Hence, overall project
sustainability is uncertain.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
35.                  IDA's performance was generally satisfactory, with the exception of the
appraisal stage when differences between donors regarding project objectives and strategy were
apparently not adequately resolved; this resulted in a complex and diffused project. Project
strategy was weak because the technical and institutional risks had not been sufficiently analyzed.
Therefore, guidelines for implementation, including indicators, were mostly lacking. IDA was
also slow to react to the initial difficulties experienced by the project. Its later interventions and
proposal for a Working Group to analyze the situation and propose remedies was opportune.
This approach facilitated the building of a consensus about future directions and generated
growing self-confidence from the new management. In all, 12 supervision missions visited the
project and Government found their input useful, particularly for facilitating procurement,
disbursement and training; management advice given from 1991 to 1993 to the PMU was
particularly useful. Supervisions were effective in obtaining gradual compliance to the major
covenants, and showed sufficient flexibility to adjust to a difficult situation. There appears to
have been some client concerns that the staff mix of the missions was heavily oriented towards
administrative matters and often lacked the technical expertise required to focus the PMU on what
was essential to meet the project objectives.



-9-
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
36.                  Taking into account the economic and social difficulties that the country
was facing during the whole implementation period, Government performance was generally
satisfactory. These difficulties, however led to serious delays in filling key counterpart posts and
providing incentives to attract personnel to the Darfur area, as well as in authorizing use of
income from cost recovery. They also accounted for misappropriation of project vehicles by
security forces. Notwithstanding these, the Government was quite supportive of the project and
ensured that counterpart funds to WSDC were available. The importance of linkages was not
fully recognized and similar support was not extended to collaborating agencies which remained
poorly funded, or deliberately redirected their resources to other regions.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
37.                  The environmental goals of arresting land degradation and replacing
shifting cultivation with a more productive and sustainable agriculture have not been achieved
because of weaknesses in design and strategy with respect to beneficiary participation,
institutional arrangements and analysis of technical and economic viability. A sustainable water
supply system with full cost recovery could not be achieved because of inefficient parastatal
performance and poor pricing policies. Water supply costs could probably have been reduced
with beneficiary participation in design and implementation, as is now being envisaged. The
settlement program was halted because of high costs and lack of evidence of sustainability. The
production objectives were mostly attained (despite the unsuitability of most of the farm
technologies developed under phase 1), through an increase in area cultivated, rather than through
the introduction of a more sustainable and effective farming system -- as originally envisaged.
However, some noteworthy achievements of the project were as follows: the development of a
donkey plough, which relieved a serious labour constraint and allowed a fast expansion in area
cultivated; the introduction, on-farm testing, and multiplication of some drought tolerant varieties
of sorghum, millet and groundnut; and some improvement in animal health through vaccinations
(albeit, the actual vaccination rate of 30 percent is significantly below the appraisal target of 90
percent) and the partial privatization of drug distribution. The project was also successful in
establishing a number of women's societies, which were the vehicle for: adult literacy training;
establishment of kindergartens; and training in the manufacture of cheese and soap, improved
food preparation, awareness of nutritional standards, and in handicrafts. On the basis of these
achievements the project could be rated as marginally satisfactory; however, in view of its
primary objectives not being realized, overall project performance is rated unsatisfactory.
38.                  The project's fundamental objective of environmentally sustainable
agricultural development was not disavowed during the mid-term review, but was given lower
priority.  There is little doubt that, with better direction of efforts, more could have been
achieved by the project towards generating and extending better land management practices, in
particular through the forage development strategy, envisaged in the SAR but never actively
pursued. The key constraints experienced during implementation originate in: weaknesses in the
assumptions and design of the strategy adopted for the environmental objectives of the project;
the complexity of the project together with the excessive number of (weak) implementing
agencies; insufficient coordination among co-financiers; and the economic difficulties of the
country. Furthermore, the failure of the settlement, water and land improvement components,
illustrates the high costs of inadequate planning and analysis and of insufficient beneficiary
participation in design and implementation. Some of the ingredients in the successful activities
of the project were: active and helpful guidance from supervision missions as well as strong



-10-
Government commitment; improved technical and institutional capacity at WSDC and in the
regional animal health services; and effective technical assistance inputs with respect to on-farm
research and animal-drawn implements.
H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
39.                 Whereas the SAR envisaged a gradual reduction in the role of WSDC,
to the benefit of specialized agencies, the reverse has happened. With the recent administrative
and political decentralization, it is envisaged that WSDC would take on a regional development
planning function, while retaining as well its implementation capacity for agricultural
development (on-farm research, extension, seed multiplication, range & pasture development,
etc.). Implementation capacity developed under the project could continue, if WSDC is able to:
(i) attract sufficient resources; and (ii) retain qualified staff. Regarding water supply,
responsibilities for O&M and water revenues collection are being devolved to rural Councils and
water Committees; NRWC would be established as an autonomous enterprise that would work
on contract with the rural Councils.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
40.                  This project provides some useful lessons on the relative strengths and
weaknesses of different development instruments and approaches:
The success and likely sustainability of certain components--
animal drawn implements, new (imported) crop varieties, animal
health, women's groups--illustrates the strength of a focussed and
discrete "project" approach in introducing new technology or
even social change which meet specific constraints of the
beneficiaries and bring immediate and obvious benefits. It is
important that this important strength of the "project approach"
is not lost sight of. The present focus on "program" and sectoral
approaches have their own strengths, but could be weak or slow
in addressing specific and immediate needs of poor beneficiaries.
On the other hand the coordination and implementation delays
illustrate the inapplicability of the "project" approach to dealing
with major institutional and capacity constraints in the public
sector. Attempts to by-pass these constraints through parallel
arrangements (autonomous agencies and PMU) have rarely been
successful or sustainable and WSDP-II has proven to be no
exception.   A  program  approach  to  rationalization  and
improvement of the regional institutions and coordination
mechanisms would have been a more sustainable approach.
An area project was also not the appropriate instrument for
addressing problems of national scope, such as the reform of
water policies and institutions.
The failure of the settlement, water and sustainable farming
systems components illustrate the high costs of inadequate
planning and analysis and insufficient beneficiary participation in



-11-
design  and  implementation.    Careful planning  of water
development with beneficiary participation to reduce costs and
tailor activities to specific needs, rather than organized
settlements, was probably the only feasible strategy to improve
land utilization at regional level. The strategy for sustainable
farming and livestock systems was based on insufficient analysis
of parameters and constraints; a more flexible approach with
gradual expansion of the relevant findings of Phase I and testing
of new technologies would have been more appropriate.
The failure of these environmentally- oriented activities may also
be an indication of the difficulties of linking broad, long-term
environmental goals to communities (or even public services)
with other more immediate and pressing concerns.
The successful on-farm program for new crop varieties and the
farm implements program illustrate the value of practical
technical  expertise3/  in  addressing   information   and
technological gaps when there is strong client demand.
While the Bank missions were effective in obtaining gradual
compliance to the major covenants, and showed sufficient
flexibility to adjust to a difficult situation, there appears to have
been some client concerns that the staff mix of the missions was
heavily oriented towards administrative matters and often lacked
the technical expertise required to focus the PMU on what was
essential to meet the project objectives. Supervision missions
with a balanced staff composition/ skill mix, could have
contributed to a more successful project performance.
3/ TA is also situation specific. The same expert who was responsible for the success of the donkey
plough was refused by a neighboring country on the grounds of insufficient academic credentials.
After the successful Sudanese program he was ineffective in another neighboring country which has
more advanced animal traction technology and apparently little interest in his skills. He is now being
tried in yet another neighboring country with undeveloped animal traction potential.

al Costs and benefits are expressed in 1 994 constant prices. Inflators are shown in the project tiles.
bl Costs include project investment costs, replacements and recurrent costs.
cl Benefits are net of production and operating costs as shown in appendices. Details are in the project files.
d) In calculating gross benefits, the following economic prices have been used:
Sorghum   LS 4520 per ton  Details are in the project files
Millet LS 4520 per ton ( a sorghum proxy has been used since millet is not internationally traded)
Groundnuts LS 133653 per ton  Details are in the project files.
Beef LS1015375 per ton  Details are in the project files
el Costs have been assumed to be 34% local and 66% loyeign (as per SAR)
e) On-farm labor costs have been left at their financial values since labor is reportedly not abundant in the project area.
f( Other local socts have been converted into economic values using a SCF of 0.80

APPENDIX A
MISSION'S AIDE-MEMOIRE






29 Sept. 1994
SUDAN - Western Savannah Project Phase II
Implementation Completion Report Mission
Aide-Memoire
Introduction
1.         An FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program (CP) mission composed of Francois
Dauphin (agronomist), Fred Bitanihirwe (financial analyst), and Ahmed Belfouzi (engineer),
visited Sudan from 12 to 30 September 1994 to prepare the Implementation Completion
Reports for the above project as well as for South Kordofan Agricultural Development
Project. The mission held discussions with senior officials of the Ministry of Finance and
Planning, and visited the project area, accompanied by an official from the Ministry of
Agriculture. In South Darfur, the mission worked with the Director General and the senior
staff of the project; a field visit was made to the Province of Ed Daein and to Um Rakuba
settlement, as well as to project areas south of Nyala. The mission was received by the
Governor of South Darfur and the State Minister of Agriculture.
2.         The mission wishes to express their appreciation for the excellent organization
of the visits, the efforts made by project staff to prepare the needed information, including
the preparation of a Project Completion Report, and their cordial hospitality. These made the
work of the mission that much easier in a very tight time-frame.
Project Objectives
3.         The West Savannah Development Project, Phase II (WSAP-2), aimed at
developing more intensive and more sustainable agricultural practices so as to arrest land
degradation (resulting from an influx of refugees from the drought-stricken Northern Darfur),
and feed an increasing population. Intensification was seen as possible from the results of
adaptive research conducted during phase I. Unused fertile land could be brought under
cultivation through the rehabilitation of wateryards and the cultivation of heavy soils by
tractor.
4.         The water supply component envisaged the rehabilitation and installation of 54
wateryards, the installation of 15 new wateryards, the establishment of a comprehensive
maintenance program and full cost recovery for all 233 wateryards in the project area. A
small haffir program was also envisaged to serve nomadic communities in grazing areas
where aquifers are difficult to locate.
5.         The possibility to stop and reverse land degradation rested on the assumption that
a controlled settlement process and (largely undefined) soil fertility raising practices would
avoid the rapid exhaustion of fragile soils typically brought by shifting cultivation.
1



6.        While the rationale for organized settlements remains a subject of intensive
debate, the SAR failed to acknowledge that the proposed yield raising techniques bad been
insufficiently tested by WSAP-1, while those aimed at improving soil fertility, including
fallow improvement, had not been tried in the project area. Under these conditions, the
realization of the intended objectives would have necessitated a far stronger emphasis on on-
farm research than envisaged in the SAR.
7.        A further weakness in the design was the addition to the core program (water
supply, settlements and extension) of components not equally crucial to the achievement of
the project objectives (range improvement, forestry, roads, and support to two existing
agricultural research centres). Given the otherwise sound decision to execute most activities
through government agencies operating at various admninistrative levels, this led to an overly
complex institutional organization.
8.        The objectives and the focus of the project were revised in 1988. Although the
long term land conservation goal was not explicitly discarded, land use planning and fixed
tenure were no longer seen as central to land improvement, and the work on settlements was
frozen, while priority was given to the generation and extension of new technology to benefit
a majority of farmers.
Implementation Experience and Results
9.        General. The above design problems, and particularly the lack of a common
understanding among project staff, donors, and local authorities, of the development strategy
and the role of the settlements, resulted into dissensions. Each PMU section undertook to
implement their component in isolation from the others. Following the appointment of a new
director in 1988, WSDC was restructured, objectives clarified, and a new sense of purpose
gradually emerged, while management significantly improved. However, the initial
difficulties and the related lack of continuity in national and international project staff
resulted in serious delays in the implementation of most components. Other factors (para 17)
contributed to the delays which are the main reason for achievements being generally lower
than envisaged.
10.       Agricultural Development. With the curtailment of the work on settlements,
which were to be the testing ground for new land management, the original concern on land
improvement was largely forgotten. However, there is at present a renewed interest in
settlements by project staff and local governments. The settlements represent an undisputable
(and unique) social success: there is strong demand for the services which are provided to
those villages by the project, and with it, an acceptance of the rigid organization which they
impose. It is all the more regrettable that this goodwill, backed by farmers' understanding
that the same land will have to be kept over the years, was not used to pursue vigorously the
development of improved land management practices.
11.       The project has established a reasonably efficient extension service, covering 122
extension villages, and new technology is being made available. Through a well conducted
program of genetic introduction and on-farm testing, a number of well adapted early
maturing varieties of sorghum, millet, groundnut and cowpea are now available or at hand,
while contract seed multiplication is progressing. The introduction, testing, improvement and
2



local production through trained blacksmiths of a range of draft implements is an even more
impressive success. Benefits of varietal improvement and development of animal traction are
expected to be sustainable. Ten Women Development Centres (not foreseen at appraisal) have
been established.
12.       Animal Health. The project has helped Veterinary Services to maintain or
improve the coverage reached by the end of phase I, and has improved the sustainability of
services to livestock owners through the establishment of a revolving fund and adequate cost
recovery, the establishment of private veterinary practices, and the training of community
supported veterinary assistants for nomads and transhumants.
13.       Water Supply The wateryard rehabilitation program started only in 1990 and
progress remained slow thereafter; delays were due to weak cooperation between WSDC and
NRWC, a reassessment in 1989 by the new advisory team of the equipment required, and
slow procurement. However, physical objectives have been achieved. Due to the lack of
spare parts for the scrapers, only one new haffir has been constructed and 4 existing haffirs
were desilted.-The wateryards maintenance system is still inadequate, as NRWC, plagued by
financial difficulties, is unable to operate a preventive plan and carries out essentially
emergency repairs. The 1992 Eoroconsult study shows that a comprehensive maintenance
system would be expensive and difficult to implement. Water charges cover only 1/3 of real
costs as estimated by NRWC. Moderate increases in water rates would be acceptable to most
users provided water supply is dependable, but full recovery is unlikely. Local authorities
and project management hope that the planned decentralization of wateryard management
responsibilities to rural councils will provide greater sustainability. However, it seems
unlikely that the councils would be able to finance major rehabilitation works.
14.       Roads. The road program was implemented smoothly and reached most of its
objectives, with the exception of the Nyala-Buram section which was not authorized by IDA.
A 40 m long bridge was constructed on Wadi Ibra. However, the program is too small to
have any significant impact on the economy of the project area.
15.       Physical achievements. The project rehabilitated all 54 wateryards envisaged at
appraisal and constructed 6 new ones as compared to 11 at appraisal; 30 new water tanks
were erected or replaced. The project has constructed 13 Irish bridges, 12 culverts, and 6
km of raised earth embankment (SAR estimates 24, 6, and 37 respectively). The project also
constructed 71 buildings including staff quarters, office accommodation, clinics, schools,
training facilities, and laboratories. The project procured 93 motor vehicles including 22
trucks and 56 pickups. On the training side, 61 people attended courses of varying duration
and disciplines outside Sudan. About 20 attained higher degrees. The project established 2
new settlements as agreed at MTR (SAR objective was 11) and settled some 500 families.
16.       Project Costs and Financing. Total project costs are expected to be in the
region of US$ 48 million which is about 10% higher than the appraisal estimate. IDA
provided US$ 10 million (SDR 7.6 million) out of an agreed amount of US$ 10.6 million
(SDR 10.2 million). The contributions of IFAD and ODA are expected to be about US$ 12.0
millions for IFAD (compared to the agreed US$9.9 million) and US$ 13 million for ODA
(which is about 20% over appraisal estimate). GOS has provided the equivalent of US$ 12.5
million which is US$ 1.0 million in excess of what was expected. ODA suspended
disbursements to the project in 1991 and IDA followed suit in September 1993.
3



17.        Major Constraints. In addition to the initial difficulties mentioned above (para
9), the long deferred appointment of key national staff, due to a freeze in recruitment (lifted
in 1990), and to inadequate incentives (rectified in 1991) was also responsible for the delays
observed in implementation. Other factors which contributed to delays and lower
achievements than expected were:
- the weakness of cooperating agencies, aggravated by low Government funding; for instance,
NRWC is lead to use water revenues for financing the salaries of its staff rather than the
maintenance of water supply systems;
- the misappropriation of project vehicles until 1990;
- delays in procurement as a result of lengthy procedures by the financing agencies, lack of
procurement skills and failure to follow guidelines, as well as of protracted transport delays
from Port Sudah to Nyala;
- rapid inflation and large devaluations of the local currency which have greatly increased
operating costs;
- insufficient financial resources following the suspension of disbursements by IDA, and
lately, a decline in financial contribution from GOS.
18.        Bank and Borrower Performance. Up to the time of the suspension of
disbursements, IDA's performance was generally satisfactory. Disbursements were generally
made on time and procurement matters were attended to within the laid down procedures.
However, more active supervision during the initial years would have likely allowed an
earlier restructuring of project activities, and relieved much of the difficulties which resulted
from the lack of shared objectives and strategy.
19.        Within the constraints imposed by the economic and social situation of the
country, GOS has generally performed creditably throughout project implementation. It has
fulfilled most of the covenants under the project agreement and provided it's agreed financial
contribution to the project until very recently when difficulties have been experienced as a
result of budgetary problems. The PMU at Nyala is doing a commendable job particularly
in the light of the financial and logistical problems it is facing.
Future Operations and Key Lessons
20.        Lack of adequate funding is by far the greatest threat to the sustainability of this
project. In order to alleviate this problem and for improved efficiency, project management
plans to:
a) Further divest from operations which could be carried out by private
entrepreneurs. These include tractor operations, seed multiplication and
maintenance workshop facilities.
b) Increasingly charge beneficiaries for services rendered, and involve local
governments in the planning and financing of these services.
4



The overall aim is to transform Western Savannah Development Corporation into a much
leaner organization largely involved in agricultural planning and research for the State.
Key Lessons
a) Complex project design with too many components complicates project
irnplementation, particularity in coordination, and should be avoided;
b) however, to the extent that related developments are needed in a number of
different areas, it is important to analyze, the relationships among those and
ensure that linkages are understood and maintained throughout implementation;
c) close project supervision, particularly in the early implementation stage, might
alleviate some of the risks of project complexity;
d) Cost recovery for the wateryards could be further improved if the service was
made more reliable. However, full cost recovery of water supply from deep
boreholes for human and animal consumption remains illusory if the drain on
families' cash income may be as high as 30%. Insistence on this would cause
concentration of populations on the areas where free water is available, leading
to land degradation. To the extent that the benefits of wateryards are largely
environmental, an element of subsidization is warranted.
21.       Next Steps. On return to Rome, the mission will prepare a draft ICR to be
forwarded to IDA by November 1994.
