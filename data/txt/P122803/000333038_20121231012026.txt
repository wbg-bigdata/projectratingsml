1.     Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1    Context at Appraisal

PRSG-7 was designed in a context of renewed political stability. In 2011, President
Boni Yayi gained a second term in office after winning 53 percent of the vote in the first
round of the Presidential elections. Subsequent legislative elections held in April secured
a comfortable coalition majority in Parliament for the President (63 of 83 MPs). In this
favorable context, the newly elected government reaffirmed its commitment to pursue
ambitious structural reforms to spur economic growth.

At the same time however, Benin faced several challenges. This stand-alone operation
was designed in a context of considerable economic instability due to the global
economic and financial crisis, the energy and food price crises and the severe floods
which hit the country in 2010. Real GDP growth had slowed from an average of 4.5
percent over the 2000-2008 period to 2.7 percent in 2009 and 2.8 percent in 2010. Post-
flood rehabilitation costs were estimated at about 2 percent of GDP in 2011.

The slowdown in economic activity resulted in a shortfall of fiscal revenues. To meet
fiscal deficit objectives, the Government tightened fiscal policy in the second half of
2010 and sustained this policy during 2011. Domestically financed investments were
streamlined and non-priority current expenditures were cut. The Government
implemented strict budget regulation mechanisms in order to match expenditures to
available revenues and was able to keep the fiscal deficit within program targets.
However, this was detrimental to budget execution in key priority social sectors.

Structural reforms had largely stalled over the 2008-2010 period. Much of this
stemmed from a difficult political environment where the President did not enjoy a
majority in the National Assembly and as the 2011 elections approached the National
Assembly had become increasingly contentious and the passage of reforms became
difficult. As noted however, this situation changed in early 2011 following the elections
and the political environment became much more conducive to meaningful reform efforts.

The debt sustainability analysis carried out in August 2011 showed that Benin was
at a low risk of debt distress. As of end-December 2010, Benin’s external debt
amounted to US$1.3 billion or 19 percent of GDP. The bulk of this debt (83 percent) was
due to multilateral institutions under concessional terms. Internal public debt represented
20 percent of total public debt. External financing requirements in 2011 were
estimated at US$380 million, resulting in a total financing gap of about US$70 million.
The financing gap was fully covered by donors, including the US$30 million of PRSG-7
proceeds.

PRSG-7 followed two previous PRSC series, PRSCs 1-3 and PRSCs 4-6. Results of
those previous series were moderately satisfactory for the most part and lessons learned
from those previous operations were incorporated into the design of the PRSG-7.


                                            1
Initially, a new programmatic series was envisaged and the operation went to the
ROC stage with the PRSG-7 being presented as the first in a series of three
operations. At the ROC meeting the team was asked to consider delaying the
programmatic series and consider a stand-alone operation that could quickly demonstrate
greater commitment to more ambitious reform given the Government’s expressed resolve
to move more boldly on reform efforts. The team discussed this approach with the
authorities, obtained commitment to more meaningful reforms and proceeded with a
stand-alone PRSG-7 operation.

1.2          Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The PRSG-7 objectives are consistent with Bank CAS under implementation in the
preparation period, specifically pillars I and III: (i) strengthening competitiveness and
accelerating private sector-led growth; and (ii) promoting better governance and
strengthening institutional capacities. The Tier 1 development objectives of PRSG-7
were also aligned with Benin’s Third Growth Strategy for Poverty Reduction (GSPR-3)
and were aimed to accelerate real economic growth and reduce the incidence of poverty
in Benin through focusing on the two following Tier 2 development objectives:

 (i)         Strengthen public sector management, administration and policy making through
             meaningful public financial management, civil service, customs, decentralization
             and structural reforms; and

 (ii)        Enhance private sector competitiveness and greater economic diversification.

1.3   Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification

The objectives and indicators were not revised.

1.4          Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

In line with program objectives, PRSG-7 focused on improving public sector policy
and strengthening public administration through focusing on the policy areas noted
below:

PILLAR 1: Public Financial Management and Public Administration

      (i)       Budget planning and execution;
      (ii)      Public procurement;
      (iii)     Decentralization;
      (iv)      Civil Service reform; and
      (v)       Public sector governance (corruption);

PILLAR 2: Private Sector Competitiveness and Economic Diversification

      (vi)      Transport, port and customs reform;

                                                 2
      (vii) Business enabling environment; and
      (viii) Agricultural diversification and cotton sector reform.


PRSC-7 supported key focus policy reforms as detailed in the Government’s Letter
of Development Policy (LDP). These measures were consistent with the GSPR-3
(2011-2015) and the associated Priority Action Plan. Effective implementation of all
prior actions (Table 1), as defined in the Financial Agreement, formed the basis for IDA
to proceed with the proposed operation. Given that the PRSG-7 was a standalone
operation, no triggers were defined for subsequent operations. However, to sustain policy
dialogue around key policy reforms, the policy matrix spanned a medium term horizon
with indicative policy reforms which could be pursued under subsequent budget support
operations.

2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1      Program Performance

PRSG-7 was fundamentally designed to capitalize on the post-election impetus to
advance ambitious reforms and to demonstrate clear government commitment. PRSG-7
developed measurable outcomes indicators related to the policy areas and prior actions
agreed to with the authorities. Tier 1 and Tier 2 indicators were identified, with
attribution relating to Tier 2 indicators only. Of the 21 Tier 2 results indicators for which
2011 targets were set, 11 (52 percent) were fully met. Of the 7 Tier 2 indicators where
targets were not set, 5 showed improvement, 1 did not change and 1 (cost to import)
deteriorated.

Pillar I: Public Financial Management and Public Administration

Strengthen public sector management, administration and policy making through
meaningful public financial management, civil service, decentralization and governance
reforms

The new Organic Budget Law (LOLF) was submitted to the Supreme Court as a
prior action and it was introduced in the National Assembly on October 24, 2012.
The new LOLF incorporates the 2009 WAEMU directives, introduces major PFM
reforms and creates a new legal and institutional budget framework. However, it was
anticipated that this would require a significant effort and time to fully implement. As
                                                       6
such, the Government has developed a strategy and action plan for implementation of the
LOLF over the next few years. Future operations, including the next PRSC-8 will
support some of the more critical measures included in the implementation action plan in
order to ensure effective implementation.

The 2012 PEFA auto-evaluation (with support from AFRITAC) conducted by the
Ministry of Economy and Finance and the 2010 Public Expenditure Review indicate
that PFM in Benin has improved, though substantial room for further improvement
remains. Table 3 notes the improvement achieved between the 2007 PEFA and the 2012

Improvement has stemmed from reforms to: institutionalize program
budgets, including procedures for their preparation, implementation and control;
computerize budget execution, accounting and reporting; strengthen the design and
implementation of procurement reforms; and improve internal budget control. Though
not all of these areas were included in PRSG-7 as prior actions, many related policy
measures were discussed during the policy dialogue process. As such, the influence of
the operation extends considerably beyond the individual actions specifically included as
prior actions.

Limited progress was observed in budget execution rates. While execution rates have
been low in both priority and non-priority areas, largely as a result of expenditure
contraction in response to lower than expected revenues, the gap in budget execution
rates between non-priority and priority programs widened through end-2011. In 2011,
priority social sector spending as identified in the ECF program with the IMF, realized an
execution rate of only 75 percent, as compared to the overall budget execution rate of 83
percent.

The Government adopted a number of reforms to address some of these issues. To
ensure that priority spending was not compromised, the Government explicitly identified
priority expenditures in the budget and this was included as an indicator in PRSG-7.
Unfortunately, spending targets on priority social programs were not met at end-2011.
This was due largely to failures in the monitoring system to ensure adequate attention to
these expenditures and to lower than expected revenues, which necessitated expenditure

                                               7
reductions, including in priority areas. Subsequently, the monitoring system for priority
expenditures has been strengthened and execution rates on priority expenditures have
improved through 2012. As of end-June 2012 priority social spending totaled CFAF 82.1
billion against a target of CFAF 75 billion. Furthermore, overall budget execution rates
improved over 2011 and have continued to improve through 2012, though investment
spending remains problematic.

In the area of public procurement, a new Procurement Code was passed in August
2009, but it has taken some time to put the necessary regulatory framework in place.
Most of the procurement decrees have been implemented and were recognized as prior
actions in the PRSG-7. The final decree and the creation, staffing and resourcing of the
procurement agencies responsible for the public procurement process are being supported
under PRSC-8 as prior actions.

While PRSG-7 made significant progress, the potential for resistance to
fundamental reform of the procurement process should not be under-estimated.
The substantial delay between passage of the new procurement code in 2009 and
completion/approval of the supporting decrees in 2012 is not coincidental. While the
delay is to some extent a function of capacity constraints, it is also a reflection of internal
resistance to reform by those with vested interests in maintaining current arrangements.
On-going measures to further strengthen procurement processes, oversight and control is
planned and may be supported by future PRSC operations as well as by activities being
undertaken by other donors.

Progress in advancing procurement reforms included: the preparation of a manual on
public procurement procedures; an appeals procedures manual; and a guide to assist firms
in understanding and accessing the public procurement process. These are being finalized
and will then be disseminated across ministries, procurement agencies and to the private
sector. A feasibility study has also been undertaken on the development of a new
Integrated Public Procurement Management System (SIGMAP). In terms of ex-ante
procurement control, a reference price software system has been designed and in terms of
ex-post control the strengthening of technical supervision skills has commenced through
the training of financial program performance auditors.

Civil service reform in Benin has been supported by the Bank and other donors in
the past with little success. The nature of such reform requires significant commitment
at the highest political level, in addition to the knowledge and capacity required to
implement meaningful reform. Assistance in the absence of such commitment has
proven ineffective.

However, the wage bill reached such proportions that civil service reform demanded
political attention. With the wage bill presenting the greatest fiscal challenge on the
expenditure side, the President publically committed to a meaningful civil service reform
effort. Indeed, the President asked for Bank support in September 2011 to assist Benin in
consolidating and integrating their human resource systems with the payroll system in an
effort to better manage the wage bill. This TA support was provided and funded under
PRSG-7 and the wage bill is now coming back down after several years of increases.

                                              8
Reinforcing regional financial autonomy remains an important element in the
decentralization effort, as not only does it allow for more local discretion and local
determination in the allocation of scarce public resources, but it is equally important in
ensuring the effective transfer of responsibilities to the local level and more importantly
effective exercise of the responsibilities thus transferred. While the proportion of the
budget disbursed at local/decentralized levels is slightly higher than other countries in
West Africa, it is well below the level experienced in Anglophone countries in sub-
Sahara Africa where decentralization efforts are much more advanced.

Budget execution rates at the communal level remain around 60 percent, as
compared to presently around 80 percent nationally for current expenditures. These rates
are explained by serious capacity constraints. This is further aggravated by the low level
of predictability of resources from the center.

Combating corruption has been a stated priority of President Yayi since he took
office in 2006. Preparation of anti-corruption legislation had been in the works almost
since the day he was initially elected President, but the drafting of such legislation took
an inordinate amount of time. Following his re-election in March 2011 and the inclusion
of the legislation as a key prior action under PRSG-7, the effort rapidly gained
momentum. The National Assembly passed the legislation on August 30, 2011. It
addresses all forms of corruption including, fraud, embezzlement, miss-use of public
funds, influence peddling, party and electoral financing, public procurement, nepotism
and favoritism in hiring practices, and provides for stiff penalties; imposing the stiffest
penalties for those in high public office and those occupying key positions. The
legislation establishes a National Authority to Combat Corruption made up of 13
representatives, including members of civil society and the private sector. Although
operating with rather independent powers, this authority will be situated in the Presidency.
Some members of Parliament expressed a desire to see the authority achieve greater
independence. A corruption hot-line that directs callers directly to the Presidency has
also been established and its creation has been communicated publicly.

An integral part of the implementation process is the need for monitoring and
tracking of the enforcement process. This goes beyond the monitoring of traditional
perceptions-based indicators of corruption. These have proven to be in many cases
inaccurate measures of actual levels of corruption and in the case of Benin may over-state
the level of actual corruption. As such, potential indicators were included in the PRSG-7
program document to support Government efforts to monitor enforcement by collecting,
tracking and providing performance measures that can be acted upon, i.e., actionable
indicators. The inclusion of such indicators in PRSG-7 and the resultant need to track
them and report on them was seen as providing some incentive to effectively implement
the legislation. The indicators noted in the results matrix anticipated the development of
such a monitoring system and the intention was to engage the authorities in the
development of a monitoring system. The decrees implementing the legislation are
expected to be approved by end-December 2012 and policy dialogue efforts are focused
on the remaining decrees, after which attention will focus on a monitoring and evaluation
system.

Pillar II: Private Sector Competitiveness and Economic Diversification

Deliver more effective public services in the pursuit of enhanced private sector
competitiveness and greater economic diversification

The Port of Cotonou is a tremendously important economic asset in Benin.
Significant reform has been undertaken at the Port, including updated infrastructure,
privatization of operations, streamlining of procedures, and improved coordination and
cooperation between the various entities active in the Port. The creation of the Guichet
Unique has been very successful and has reduced transaction time from 15 days to 4 days.
Implementation of the Import Verification Program (PVI), which was included as a prior
action, was not as successful and has been met by considerable resistance.

The President and the authorities have demonstrated considerable resolve in
pursing reforms in the face of this resistance and despite the consequences this
resistance has had on government revenue. The Government passed back-to-work
legislation, including a prohibition on strikes by Customs officers, called in retired
customs officials to replace striking workers, involved the military on several occasions
and in several roles to facilitate port reforms, and the President has visited the port
frequently to personally direct and supervise specific reforms and changes. This
persistence and commitment has paid off as reforms have begun to take hold and
revenues have started to increase as the systems become fully implemented, as operators
become more comfortable and knowledgeable in using the systems, and as resistance
subsides.

While the elements and objectives of the PVI are positive, i.e., electronic scanning of
containers, GPS tracking of in-transit containers, implementation was seriously
problematic. On May 2, 2012 the Government suspended the contract with Benin
Control, the private sector operator of the PVI. This was precipitated by poor
performance of the operator (Benin Control) and an apparent personal dispute between
President Yayi and the owner of Benin Control. This turned into a fierce legal battle
between the private operator and the State. In the interim, Customs has assumed the PVI
functions. Throughout the problematic implementation period, port operations were
disrupted and the port experienced a rise in dwell time (an indicator under the operation),
a decline in port traffic and a diversion of traffic to other regional ports. Costs rose,
revenues fell and there was extreme dissatisfaction with the implementation of the PVI.

Most recently, the Government has expressed its intention to re-tender the
operation of the PVI. The existing contract with Benin Control has been cancelled and
the intention is to enter into a new contractual arrangement through an international
competitive bidding process. There is some discussion that the contract may be split with
the GPS transit tracking function being tendered on a completely private sector basis,
whereas the scanning and import verification function may be approached through a PPP
arrangement.




                                            10
The approval of a new agricultural strategy, the PSRSA, was a prior action.
Preparation of the strategy took a long time and amount of time and the elections in early
2011 and changes in ministers, including the ministers of Agriculture and Development,
delayed its adoption. In the end, the Council of Ministers adopted the strategy on
October 12, 2011.

The PSRSA (2011 – 2015) clearly articulates the orientation of the Government and
various stakeholders’ interventions in support of the agricultural sector in Benin.
The strategy’s backbone is the promotion of value chains through agricultural
entrepreneurship and professionalization of small-scale farmers. The PSRSA is structured
around four programs (agriculture, livestock, fisheries, and administration and
management of the sector) and eight strategic areas aiming to ensure: (i) availability and
access to quality seed; (ii) access to improved inputs; (iii) access to adapted
mechanization; (iv) access to adequate finance (credit and insurance mechanism); (v)
access to professional knowledge and innovations; (vi) provision of infrastructure and
agricultural facilities; (vii) access to land; and (viii) access to markets. It is supported by
an investment plan valued at CFAF 1,809 billion over a period of five years. Passage of
this strategy represents important progress in agricultural diversification, in reducing
dependence on cotton as the primary export commodity and in tapping Benin’s vast
agricultural potential. Subsequent PRSC operations will include actions and triggers to
ensure meaningful implementation of the strategy.

2.2    Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

The main external factors over the PRSG-7 period were the global financial and
economic crisis (which began in 2008 and continues today) and the lingering effects of
the late 2010 floods. These factors had some direct impact on outcome indicators. Weak
procurement and financial management practices, though improving, led to weak
execution of the public investment budget and private investment continues to be modest
in a country with a perceived poor business environment. Increased private and public
investment is needed to boost economic growth and reduce poverty incidence.

In 2011, slowdowns at the Port negatively impacted revenue collection and coupled with
a drop in budget support (from CFAF 28.9 billion in 2010 to 10.3 CFA in 2011), led
authorities to cut expenditures, including for priority social sectors, and thus many of the
budget execution targets were missed.

Political Factors

Following the elections in March and April 2011, the President now enjoys a working
majority in the National Assembly and a number of meaningful reforms were undertaken
in the few months after the elections, particularly following insistence that delivery of
budget support under the PRSG-7 would be dependent on commitment to a more
ambitious reform effort. This is perhaps indicative of the constraints that were operating
prior to this period as several reforms that had been languishing were suddenly passed
following the elections and supported by the National Assembly. As noted, these
included important reforms such as: Anti-Corruption legislation; a new agricultural
                                              11
strategy; a new LOLF; implementation of the import verification program; etc. As such,
the election results were a positive political influence.

However, the personal/political dispute and deteriorating relations between President
Yayi and Patrice Talon had significant negative effects on some of the outcomes
associated with this operation. This was particularly the case at the Port where
implementation of the PVI was wrought with difficulties. Dwell time increased
significantly, revenue fell as traffic was diverted to other regional ports, and overall port
performance suffered considerably. The root causes of this dispute remain uncertain,
though Benin Control was ill-equipped technically to handle the PVI program once SGS
(Société Générale de Surveillance) backed out of the partnership. This dispute with the
Talon Group extended to the cotton and agriculture sector and was a major distraction for
the Government over the period.

Donor Coordination

Benin has developed an effective donor coordination mechanism through the monitoring
of its poverty reduction strategy implementation. Annual joint government-donor PRS
reviews are held to assess progress around a set of identified result indicators. PRSG-7
supervision was performed in this broader context and allowed effective coordination
with other donor programs and projects. Prior actions included in the PRSG-7 were
discussed with the donors and their input was solicited and incorporated.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

PRSG-7 was designed to support implementation of the Government’s strategic
development objectives. It was monitored within the joint government-donor GSPR-3
monitoring mechanism, which included periodic reviews at the sectoral level, including
the macroeconomic and public financial management group’s quarterly meetings with the
Ministry of Economy and Finance and other sectoral ministries. PRSG-7 results
indicators are consistent with the Government’s PRS results indicators and thus were
monitored and evaluated in the M&E framework defined in the PRS. Annual high level
joint donor-government reviews are held (usually in the second half of June) to assess
progress in implementing the PRS and the attainment of targets defined for each sector.

In June 2012, the review included a meeting between HR and financial management
officers of sectoral ministries with procurement, budget directorate and budget control
staffs from the Ministry of Finance to debate the root causes of weak procurement
financial management practices which hinder implementation of the investment budget.

2.4    Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

The PRSG-7 was intended to demonstrate clear commitment to a more ambitious and
more meaningful reform effort on the part of the new Government. Following
satisfactory performance under a PRSG-7 a new PRSG 8-10 series is to be considered
assuming sustained political commitment to a long term reform program.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The policy measures pursued under PRSG-7 were appropriate to the development
challenges the Government was facing at the time of its preparation, where a newly
elected executive was in place with a comfortable majority in the National Assembly, and
where there was resolve to proceed with the implementation of ambitious policy reforms.
PRSG-7 was also built upon lessons learned from previous PRSC series, which
recommended focusing budget support operations on fewer selected policy areas. PRSG-
7 was consistent with the Bank’s CAS at the time and was grounded in recent ESW
reports.

The operation was evaluated to be of modest risk, mainly because of Benin’s track record
of political stability, but with low implementation capacity. Technical assistance was also
provided to devise a road map for the preparation of an integrated civil service database
at the Public Service Ministry. However, some of the results indicators (corruption
indicators for instance) were not available as planned in order to ensure effective
monitoring and evaluation.

3.2    Achievement of Program Development objectives

The overall objective of PRSG-7 was to support implementation of the Government’s
GSPR-3 in order to accelerate growth and reduce poverty. Real GDP growth rebounded
to 3.5 percent in 2011 and is projected to reach the same level in 2012. However, 2012-
2013 cotton production may exceed the projected 250,000 tons, reaching perhaps 350,000
tons and leading to higher than projected growth (above 4.0 percent in 2012).

Poverty indicators were mixed. Monetary poverty increased to 36.2 percent in 2011
(against 35.2 in 2009), with both rural and urban poverty increasing during the period.
However, non-monetary poverty decreased from 30.8 percent in 2009 to 30.2 percent; in
rural areas, it decreased from 35.2 percent in 2009 to 32.9 percent in 2011.

These Tier 1 results cannot be specifically attributed to policy reforms supported by
PRSG-7. The following paragraphs review the achievement of those development
objectives and outcomes directly linked to PRSG-7.

Strengthened public sector management, administration and policy making through
meaningful public financial management, civil service, decentralization and governance
reforms

(Rating: Moderately Satisfactory)

Under the first objective, or Pillar 1, indicators generally showed progress, but some
lagged expectations.

The prior actions relating to the passage of several public procurement decrees and the
ongoing policy dialogue on public procurement processes showed some positive results.
                                            13
In terms of indicators on public procurement delays: for goods procurement the result
was 64 days against a target of 55 days; for services the result was 71 days while the
target was 65; and for public works (arguably the most problematic area) the target was
met, 59 days against a target of 75 days. All these indicators improved substantially from
the previous year, 88 to 64, 80 to 71, and 91 to 59, though two of the three did not meet
their expected target.

The average payment delay improved from 17.6 days in 2010 to 15 days in 2011, ahead
of the target of 24 days.

Payment orders were reduced from 4.8% of the total budget to 4.4%. The target is to
maintain payment orders under 8% and this was met.

Budget execution rates for the most part improved. (See Table 2) Execution rates for
priority identified line items were 75% at end-2011, but improved to 109% by end-June
2012, as the Government implemented a strengthened monitoring system. The target was
to maintain the execution rate on priority line items above 90%.

The unallocated percentage of the budget, that portion maintained at the center by the
Ministry of Finance, fell from 14% of the total budget to 10%, in line with the target.

The wage bill, after several years of increases, commenced a reversal in 2012; 45.1% of
tax revenues in 2009, 45.4% in 2010, 46.7% in 2011, and 43.6% through mid-2012.
Technical assistance provided under PRSG-7 in harmonizing the human resources
management information system with the payroll system may have contributed to this
improving outcome, as well as the focus on wage bill issues in policy dialogue with the
authorities.

In terms of decentralization efforts, the Government in 2011 transferred 111% of planned
FADEC transfers to the communes against a target of 100%, an improvement over the
previous year’s transfer of 84.4%. The prior action relating to the completion of the
audits of FADEC resource transfers to all 77 communes and the resultant audit
recommendations may have been influential in keeping the rate of compliance with the
local administration and budget law over the target of 80% -- at 86.3%, compared to
82.9% in 2009 and 88.4% in 2010.

As noted earlier, the monitoring and evaluation framework for measuring the impact of
the Anti-Corruption legislation (a prior action in PRSG-7) has yet to be developed.
However, the Corruption Perceptions Index as measured by Transparency International
has improved to a score of 3.6 (rank of 94) in 2012, from 3.0 (rank of 100) in 2011, 2.8
(rank of 110) in 2010, and 2.9 (rank of 106) in 2009. Administrative actions have been
taken in several high profile corruption cases and the President has made several
pronouncements against corruption. Progress in this regard is positive.

Deliver more effective public services in the pursuit of enhanced private sector
competitiveness and greater economic diversification

(Rating: Moderately Satisfactory)

Under Pillar 2 results were similarly mixed.
Authorities stepped up efforts to improve the business environment in Benin over the
2011-2012 period. Benin’s ranking in the 2012 doing business report improved slightly
(175th out of 185 countries against the same out of 183 countries in 2011). This is largely
due to staffing of the Presidential Investment Council with qualified experts (including
one IFC technical expert). The new committee designed a focused short-term (2011-
2012) action plan to strengthen DB indicators in six areas: (i) starting a business; (ii)
dealing with construction permits; (iii) registering property; (iv) getting credit; (v) trading
across borders; and (iv) enforcing contracts. The program was supported by IFC and
some progress was noted in the following areas:

(a): Starting a business:

(i) An electronic platform funded by the MCA was launched on March 26th, 2012; the
new platform electronically interconnects all the administrations involved in the business
registration process such as the Tax Authority and the Commercial registry (RCCM);
accordingly, procedure #4 in the DB report is now merged with the procedure #5;

(ii) The Unique Fiscal Identification Number (IFU number) is now issued within 24
hours instead of taking up to 7 days. In addition to the reduction in the number of
procedures and time, the cost of starting a business was also reduced as fees at the one-
stop shop have been restructured and reduced;

(iii) The publication of the business formation notice is now also handled by the one stop
shop. This reduced the cost of the publication from 40,000 CFAF to 25,000 CFAF ;

(iv) The business registration process involves some double counting in the calculation
of costs. For example, the amount noted by the current data as the notary fee also
includes the cost of publication in the official gazette as well as the one stop fees.

(b) Dealing with Construction Permits

(i)     The municipality of Cotonou issued on March 26, 2012 a communiqué outlining
several measures to reduce the time of reviewing construction permit applications. Indeed
a committee grouping all entities involved in the construction permit application approval
process meets twice a month. These measures addressed the backlog in permit
applications and have reduced to less than 30 days the time needed for the Municipality
to deliver the permit.

( C ) Getting electricity

(i) Benin Electricity Company (SBEE) put in place 8 desks to implement a special
treatment procedure for companies. It allows privileged and accelerated treatment to the

                                              15
benefit of firms. The implementation of this reform has been confirmed by practitioners
and reduced the time needed to process electricity connection applications to a period of
2 weeks.

(d) Trading across borders

(i) The Government of Benin implemented in 2011 an electronic single window for
goods clearance to ease procedures at the port of Cotonou. The Single window, called
"SEGUB?, connected the control/inspection agencies, the port administration and the
various agencies involved in the clearing process to the single electronic platform (about
9 agencies in total including the Port authority itself). This major reform allowed for a
significant reduction in time to clear goods administratively from about 10 days to one
day.

(ii) The Government also established a single electronic payment system called
"Bordereau de Frais Unique (BFU)" which regroups all the payments due for the goods
clearance at the Port, including the Customs duties. This system regrouped payments of 9
agencies into one and allows traders and freight forwarders to make a unique/single
payment for all the procedures electronically through the commercial banks.

( e ) Enforcing contracts

The Government of Benin has enforced a new Code of Civil, Commercial and
Administrative Judicial Procedures since April 6, 2012. The enforcement of this code has
reduced the number of judicial procedures and the duration of proceedings. This reform
was funded by the MCA. As a result, the time for appeal is now reduced to one month
instead of two months previously; the time for appeal for annulment is now three months
instead of months; and in the first instance, the judge must issue his decision immediately
or within four months at the latest. There was no limitation in the former code.

Unfortunately, the Committee (by lack of resources) did not fully communicate all the
reforms implemented to all stakeholders and a number of reforms achieved were not
taken into account in the 2013 DB report. However, it is likely that all these efforts will
be reflected in the 2014 DB report.

As for the Tier 2 indicators, a One Stop Shop for starting a business was established in
March 2012, and accordingly fees for starting a business were reduced and the time to
start a business fell from 31 days to 26, but did not meet the target of 25 days. In terms of
enforcing contracts, which is more directly relevant to the prior action involving passage
of the code relating to commercial judicial procedures, the number of days required to
enforce a contract has fallen from 825 to 795, though the cost has remained constant at
64.7% of the claim.

Dwell time at the port increased from 18 days in 2010 to 22 days over 2011, though this
was largely due to disruptions caused by resistance to reforms and the weak capacity of
Benin Control in implementing the PVI. After suspension of the PVI contract with Benin
Control and after resistance had subsided, dwell time came down to under 15 days and is

                                             16
continuing to improve. Given that the PVI was a prior action, and that this was poorly
implemented, this aspect cannot be considered successful, though the fundamentals of the
PVI remain relevant. Also at the port, costs to export fell significantly while costs to
import rose. Again, if not for the disruptions and resistance encountered, results would
have been more favorable and signs are that costs are now falling as implementation
improves and resistance wanes.

Nonetheless, the required scale of effort in this area, particularly around the PVI, should
not be underestimated. Many of the necessary steps have now been taken to return the
Port of Cotonou to its position as the most competitive port in the region. However the
scale of the reforms that were necessary, the limited capacity to implement this reform
agenda and the resistance encountered delayed the realization of the benefits associated
with these reforms.

The PSRSA was adopted by the authorities in October 2011 (a prior action), paving the
way for the diversification of exports and growth in the agriculture sector away from the
monoculture of cotton. The Government is currently adopting the regulatory texts which
will allow for effective implementation of the PSRSA, including the institutional
reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture, establishment of a national agriculture
fund, etc.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The rating is based on relevance and PDO achievement. The PRSG-7 series was very
relevant to the economic, political and social context at the moment of implementation.
Switching the series from a programmatic series to a single operation was successful in
encouraging commitment to more ambitious reforms. However, the time period covered
by a single operation does not lend itself to the evaluation of meaningful outcomes and
the full implementation of planned reforms. As such, it is premature to determine the full
impact of the supported measures on outcomes and this will only become apparent over
time.

The achievement of outcomes will also be dependent on the support provided for
implementation of the reforms commenced under PRSG-7 in subsequent operations.
Looking at the PRSG-7 operation as laying the foundation for future operations and the
commencement of a deeper more meaningful reform phase, the operation would be
considered satisfactory, even if all indicators were not achieved over the short time span
of the operation. Furthermore, initial indicators coming in for 2012 appear to be showing
some accelerated improvement in several areas.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Preliminary results of the joint Bank-National Statistics Bureau poverty assessment
suggest that non-monetary poverty decreased over recent years (30.2 percent in 2011
compared to 30.8 percent in 2009), but that the level of monetary poverty remained more
or less constant (36.2 percent in 2011). Poverty among female-headed households was
estimated at 27.6 percent in 2011, below those of males at 38 percent. Improvement of
budget execution in the social sectors (education, health) has increased access to health
services for women, and children under five. Access to education for girls, a focus of the
education program (funded by the FTI-EFA), has also improved due to improved budget
execution.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Besides the direct development objectives described earlier, it was also expected that
PRSG-7 implementation, related technical assistance and the policy dialogue effort
would foster institutional change and strengthening in Benin. This was particularly the
case in improving public procurement and financial management where substantial policy
dialogue led to institutional strengthening and improvement in procedures and processes
that went beyond the impact of prior actions. In addition, the public-private dialogue
process was strengthened with the involvement of the CPI in the oversight of reforms
geared to improving the business environment.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Significant

The Government undertook ambitious reforms following the 2011 general elections and
affirmed its commitment to engage in a sustained partnership with the private sector in
the two key sectors driving the Beninese economy: the cotton and port sectors.
Unfortunately, the policy reversal of the partnership contracted with private operators in
these two sectors (April/May2012) has substantially undermined private sector appetite to
engage in long term contractual relationships with the Government of Benin.

In addition, the external environment continues to pose substantial risk to the attainment
of objectives. Global economic conditions may have an adverse impact on the budget,
particularly if cotton prices continue to drop as seen in 2012. In addition, private
investment may continue to stagnate at the low levels witnessed recently. Finally, trade
policy changes in Nigeria could significantly affect re-export trade from Benin and hence
revenue collection, with a resultant impact on budget execution in key social sectors.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

PRSG-7 was prepared through intensive consultation with the Government and other
donors (IMF, EU, in particular). The team supported the newly elected Government in
identifying and focusing this operation on selected policy challenges to help Benin’s
GSPR-3 implementation. Results indicators were consistent with those defined for each
pillar in the Government’s GSPR-3.

PRSC-7 was well conceived, focused on important and timely reforms and was well
aligned with Benin’s PRSP, the Bank’s CAS and was complementary to and supportive
of other Bank operations in Benin. Risks were well identified, including: political risks
and potential resistance to reforms; external economic risks; and capacity constraints.
These risks in the end had some bearing on eventual outcomes and performance. The
political risk associated with Benin Control and developments in the cotton sector was
not identified at the inception of the operation, arose unexpectedly and influenced
outcomes in the port sector.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements)

Rating: Satisfactory

The team closely monitored implementation of the reform agenda agreed to with the
Government at three levels: (i) regular discussions and meetings between the country

                                           19
office and government focal points in charge of coordinating the reform agenda; (ii)
periodic Bank macroeconomic team missions, which included assessment of progress in
implementing the reforms; and (iii) the annual joint government-donor GSPR reviews,
which were also preceded by sector reviews. Engaging the authorities on the need to
demonstrate more resolve and commitment to ambitious reform was successful and has
laid the foundation for future reforms and subsequent PRSC operations and series.

(c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Bank overall performance is rated satisfactory reflecting high relevance, strong
monitoring of policy reform implementation and sound quality at entry.

5.2      Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Government performance in preparing and implementing policy reforms supported by
PRSG-7 was mixed. The Government actively engaged in effective policy dialogue
around the supported reforms and responded willingly when asked to consider increasing
the level of ambition and then effectively accelerated reforms that had been in the
pipeline. In addition, the Government persisted in the face of resistance to reforms,
particularly at the port, and demonstrated considerable resolve. However, difficulties at
the port and the implementation of port reforms, particularly around the contracting of
Benin Control, were less than ideal and less than fully transparent. Nonetheless, the
Government took decisive action when confronted with under-performance and appears
to be rectifying the prior weaknesses in implementation.

Authorities were fully committed to the reform program, especially the focal point unit at
the Ministry of Economy and Finance (Unit in Charge of Monitoring Economic and
Financial Reforms – CSPEF). CSPEF was well involved in the design of the program and
contributed directly to the preparation process. However, over the course of
implementation, the Borrower’s performance was often hampered by the lack of
coordination between line agencies in charge of implementing various reforms and the
center.

6.       Lessons Learned

  (i)    Encouraging greater ambition when the environment appeared conducive
         proved effective. Delaying the programmatic series and switching the operation
         to a stand-alone basis was effective in generating the necessary commitment to
         and action on important reforms.

  (ii)   A good understanding of the socio-political dynamics in play is needed to
         engage in transformational policy reform in Benin. The volatile and shifting
         links between key public and private players can hamper the sustainability of
                                           20
           structural reforms needed to boost economic growth, as witnessed during PRSG-7
           in the port and cotton sectors. Public private partnership arrangements need a
           sound legal and regulatory framework (PPP Law) for engaging in transparent, fair
           and sustainable partnerships.

     (iii) Obstacles due to resistance to change and lack of capacity should not be
           underestimated. Selectivity and simplicity of design are essential to success in
           such environments, as are attention to and realism about the scope and pace of
           reform. The difficulties encountered around port reforms supported under PRSG-
           7 were a clear illustration of this phenomenon.

     (iv) PRSG-7 highlighted the importance of providing well-targeted technical
          assistance and ESW in support of key reforms where government capacity,
          though not commitment or determination, may be lacking. Bank provided
          support to civil service reform under PRSG-7 was instrumental in assisting the
          Government with implementation of the supported reform agenda.

     (v)   Stated objectives and monitored results indicators need to be realistic,
           focused on indicators that are attributable to supported actions and
           consistent over a meaningful period of time. Prior PRSC series focused on
           indicators situated at a level where attribution was difficult, if not impossible, and
           where a variety of exogenous factors weighed far more heavily on the
           achievement, or non-achievement, of results than supported actions. Furthermore,
           changing indicators frequently from one series to the next does not allow for the
           tracking of progress in areas where such progress takes considerable time to
           achieve objectives or effect meaningful change. The performance indicators used
           in PRSG-7, differentiated between Tier 1 indicators and those Tier 2 indicators
           directly attributable to the operation.

7.         Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

Comments received from the Ministry of Economy and Finance are summarized as
follows:

The reform program supported by PRSG-7 financing facilitated significant progress in
the following areas:

      •    Budget Planning and Execution: the Government transmitted to the Supreme
           Court an Organic Budget Law (LOLF), implementing the June/2009 WAEMU
           Directive – an important step in its submission to the National Assembly. This
           new draft Law provides a regulatory framework for implementation of a results-
           based budget management approach which was first introduced in the public
           administration in 2006.


                                                21
   •   Public Procurement: Measures implemented under the supported program
       strengthened transparency in public procurement through the adoption of decrees
       necessary for the implementation of the new procurement code together with the
       publication of public bidding outcomes.

   •   Governance: authorities adopted an Anti-Corruption Law in order to fight illicit
       behavior and preserve public resources for accelerating growth and reducing
       poverty.

While encouraging progress was recorded in the course of implementing the above
mentioned measures, it is necessary that the Bank further support Benin in effectively
adopting and implementing the remaining texts ensuring full implementation of the new
public procurement code and the Anti-Corruption Law. These options may be considered
in designing future Bank poverty reduction support credits.

(b) Other partners and stakeholders

The chairs of the donor coordination thematic groups on Macroeconomic/Public
Financial Management and private sector development (the EU and Dutch Embassy
respectively) commented on PRSG-7 design, implementation and results. Their
comments are summarized below:

   -   PRSG-7 strategic objectives were relevant and consistent with the Government’s
       GSPR-3 macroeconomic and sectoral objectives and concur with their
       achievement.

   -   The PRSG-7 also contributed to strengthening donor coordination at the
       macroeconomic and sectoral levels by facilitating concrete policy dialogue around
       key economic and structural reforms with Benin authorities. However, prior
       actions should be more ambitious as authorities have a tendency to accept only
       soft policy measures and those with limited risk in implementation.

   -   While Bank efforts to share information around policy reforms is commendable,
       this could be improved within the macroeconomic thematic group in order to
       foster more synergy and complementarity among donors providing budget
       support in a public environment characterized by limited capacity.
