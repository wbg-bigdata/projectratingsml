                 SEVENTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT GRANT

                             Grant and Program Summary



Recipient:                Republic of Benin
Implementing Agency:      Ministry of Economy and Finance
Operation Type:           Poverty Reduction Support Grant
Amount:                   SDR 19 million (US$30 million equivalent)
Terms:                    standard IDA grant terms.

Main Policy Areas:        PRSG-7 will focus first on strengthening public administration and
                          public financial management (budget planning and execution,
                          procurement, internal control and audit, civil service reform,
                          decentralization). In addition, it will focus on private sector
                          competitiveness by building on Benin’s comparative advantages in
                          trade/commerce and agriculture, through transport and port reform,
                          a strengthened private sector enabling environment and furthering
                          the agricultural reform agenda.

Key Outcome Indicators:   Outcome indicators are divided into Tier 1 and Tier 2 indicators in
                          order to measure both progress in meeting the objectives of
                          Benin’s SCRP (2011-2015) and the effectiveness of this operation.
                          The indicators included in Table 5.3 and Annex 2 are primarily a
                          sub-set of those presented in the Government’s SCRP (2011-2015)
                          and correspond to the objectives noted in this operation, i.e.,
                          economic growth and poverty reduction indicators (Tier 1), as well
                          as more specifically to the reform areas which form the focus of
                          this operation (Tier 2). Examples of Tier 2 indicators in the PFM
                          area include: budget execution rates (investment and current
                          expenditures), average procurement delay, average payment delay,
                          unallocated percentage of the budget, local expenditures as a
                          percentage of total expenditures, local government budget
                          execution rates, corruption indicators, etc. In the private sector
                          competitiveness area examples include: Port of Cotonou dwell
                          time, time to start a business, days to enforce a contract, cost of
                          enforcing a contract, etc.

Program Development       The Tier 1 development objective of this PRSG, in line with
Objectives and            Benin’s SCRP, the CAS and the Africa Regional Strategy is to
Contribution to CAS:      accelerate real economic growth and reduce the incidence of
                          poverty in Benin through focusing on the following two Tier 2
                          development objectives or pillars:
                             (i)     Strengthened public sector management, administration

                                            i
                                   and policy making; in order to,
                           (ii)   Deliver more effective public services in the pursuit of
                                  enhanced private sector competitiveness and greater
                                  economic diversification.
Risks and Risk          Risks facing this operation include: (i) downside risks to the
Mitigation:             macroeconomic framework; (ii) political risk and weakening
                        consensus for structural reforms; and, (iii) weak implementation
                        capacity.

                        These risks are mitigated by direct measures and actions proposed
                        in this operation to further the reform agenda, strengthen public
                        finance management, promote civil service reform and support
                        increased competitiveness and an improved investment climate,
                        thus contributing to a sound and increasingly stable
                        macroeconomic framework. Also, the IMF and the Bank are
                        working closely together in Benin, together with other donors, and
                        will continue to closely monitor the Government's macroeconomic
                        performance. Furthermore, IDA is supporting engagement with
                        domestic stakeholders, including the National Assembly, sectoral
                        ministries and civil society in order to build and reinforce
                        consensus around key reforms as well as leverage the
                        dissemination of AAA and ESW work as a means to increase
                        knowledge on the broad advantages to be gained through structural
                        reforms of national importance. Increased public awareness of
                        necessary reforms and an appreciation of the challenges are
                        important in building consensus and in garnering broad support for
                        reforms. In terms of implementation capacity, elements related to
                        capacity building and civil service reform have been incorporated
                        in this operation and several complementary Bank investment
                        activities are helping to build institutional capacity in key areas.

             PROPOSED SEVENTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT GRANT

                                TO THE REPUBLIC OF BENIN

                                     1.   INTRODUCTION

 1.1 This program document proposes a seventh Poverty Reduction Support Grant for
Benin (PRSG-7) in the amount of SDR 19 million (US$30 million). This operation is designed
to support implementation of the Government's poverty reduction strategy. Following two
previous PRSC series (six operations) this stand-alone PRSG-7 operation is intended to secure
meaningful commitment to an ambitious reform effort in support of Benin’s third Growth
Strategy for Poverty Reduction (SCRP 2011-2015). This operation is seen as laying the
groundwork and foundation for a subsequent PRSG series, which may follow given successful
implementation of the reforms supported under PRSG-7.

 1.2 The reforms supported by this operation are closely aligned with the SCRP 2011-
2015. This proposed grant is an integral part of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for
2009-2012, presented to the IDA Board in February 2009, and leverages and complements other
Bank operations in Benin.

 1.3 As Benin embarks on the implementation of a new SCRP, the country is at a
challenging juncture. A succession of external and internal shocks has seriously affected the
country’s economic growth and public finances and has possibly reversed earlier gains in
poverty reduction. These shocks started with the food and fuel price crises, continued through
the 2009 global economic crisis, were exacerbated by a Ponzi scheme scandal in the
microfinance sub-sector, and culminated in a devastating flood in the final quarter of 2010.

 1.4 Despite a long period of positive economic growth, the economy has shown little
structural change, limited diversification, an unambitious export drive beyond cotton and the
re-export/transit trade, and minimal job creation in the private sector. A more ambitious reform
effort is necessary to accelerate economic growth and meaningfully reduce poverty. The SCRP
2011-2015 aims to address these challenges and builds on measures initiated during SCRP II.

 1.5 It is in this challenging context that this PRSG aims to assist the Government in
reinforcing and strengthening the implementation of its reform agenda to support the country's
economic recovery and lay the foundation for sustained pro-poor growth.

 1.6 An Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICRR) for the PRSC 1-3 series was
completed during 2008, and an ICRR is presently being completed for the PRSC 4-6 series.
Lessons learned from those previous series are taken into account in the design of this operation,
including among others: the need for tighter focus; greater coherence with other Bank investment
operations; deeper rather than broader reforms; and, greater synergy across reforms. The design
of this PRSG benefited from broad consultations with various stakeholders under the
Government's leadership, and included close coordination with a group of donors providing


                                                1
budget support to Benin for SCRP implementation. These consultations ensure Government
ownership of the supported policies and harmonize donors around a common set of key reforms.

                                  2.    COUNTRY CONTEXT

 2.1 With a per capita income of US$680, Benin ranks in the lower income group of
countries. Economic growth slowed in 2009 and 2010 to 2.7 and 2.6 percent respectively
following the onset of the global economic crisis and losses in 2010 as a result of serious
flooding. Growth in 2011 is expected to rebound to 3.8 percent. Growth had been moderate and
steady, averaging around 4.5 percent annually during the prior decade. This moderate growth
performance remains marginally below the regional average and has contributed to only modest
increases in per capita incomes and improvements in human development. The country's
relatively high rate of population growth (3.2 percent) poses significant policy and operational
challenges as the Government struggles to keep up with the resultant increasing demand for
public services. Not surprisingly, poverty remains widespread.

 2.2 The economy relies heavily on the agricultural sector, cotton in particular, and on
re-export and transit trade with Nigeria and other neighboring countries. The agricultural
sector accounts for about 32 percent of GDP and provides nearly 70 percent of the country's
employment. Cotton is the major primary export commodity representing typically 25 to 40
percent of total exports. Re-export trade with Nigeria alone is estimated to account for between
6.5 and 7.5 percent of GDP and explains the vulnerability of the economy to trade policy
changes or economic downturns in its neighboring and main trading partner.

 2.3 Increasing economic growth and raising per capita GDP will require that Benin
increasingly capitalize on its comparative advantages in agriculture and its position as a regional
trading center. Agricultural diversification and improved agricultural productivity will be key as
will an improved business environment in order to take greater advantage of Benin’s geographic
position in serving the Nigerian market and its role as a gateway to land-locked countries to its
north.

 2.4 Public sector capacity is relatively weak and corruption and rent-seeking behavior
is fairly widespread. Budget planning, expenditure and control, including procurement,
demonstrate considerable weaknesses and budget execution rates are perennially low, less than
50 percent in many ministries and often well below that level for investment spending. Limited
capacity in the areas of procurement, planning and fiscal forecasting and programming is a
fundamental issue leading to low execution rates. Recently this has been exacerbated by poor
performance on the revenue side and the resultant need to more closely match expenditures with
available revenues.

 2.5 Benin’s economy is highly informal -- estimated to represent 50 percent or more of
the total economy. Given the prevailing business environment, private sector incentives to
engage in arbitrage opportunities related to Nigeria are significantly stronger than incentives to
pursue productive, value creating and employment generating activities in Benin. Thus,
economic growth remains muted and opportunities to diversify the economy, despite apparent
comparative advantages, remain unexploited. On the positive side, the very large, innovative

                                                2
and entrepreneurial informal economy, in which women play a large role, is a potential source of
growth, investment and untapped fiscal resources. With an improved business and investment
climate Benin could position itself favorably as a legitimate and competitive supplier to the
Nigerian and regional market.

 2.6 A decade or so ago, Benin was an ambitious and innovative performer and was seen
as a model for other West African countries. Economic performance in Benin improved
markedly post-1989 following significant political reform, macroeconomic stabilization, trade
liberalization, and divestiture of state-owned enterprises. Unfortunately, this level of
performance was not maintained, momentum was lost and a period of reform stagnation set in.
As a result, economic growth performance over the previous PRSP periods remained too low for
meaningful poverty reduction, particularly in an environment of relatively high population
growth. This was largely due to difficulties encountered in implementing ambitious PRSP plans
in a contentious and divisive political environment, although a highly democratic environment.

 2.7 Benin has experienced one of the most successful democratic transitions in Africa.
Following the March 13, 2011 elections and the April 30, 2011 parliamentary elections, the
Government is again headed by President Boni Yayi. The National Assembly is comprised of
representatives from 8 political parties, with President Yayi’s party holding 41 seats, the
opposition 20 and 7 other parties currently aligned in a coalition with the President holding 22
seats. Thus the President has a working majority of 63 seats in the 83 seat National Assembly.

 2.8 Post-elections, the administration will have a window within which it may be able to
proceed with a more ambitious reform agenda. Given a majority coalition in the National
Assembly, a new Presidential mandate and the fact that this will be President Yayi’s final term in
office, conditions would now appear conducive to the implementation of a more meaningful
reform effort. PRSG-7, and the prior actions it supports, is seen as demonstration of this
commitment prior to embarking a new programmatic series.

A    RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN BENIN

 2.9 After several recent years of steadily improving growth performance (2.9 percent in
2005, 3.8 percent in 2006, 4.6 percent in 2007 and 5.0 percent in 2008) growth slowed to 2.7
percent in 2009 and 2.6 percent in 2010. Aside from the 2010 floods, weaker performance in
2009 and 2010 was largely the result of: a decrease in re-export trade, primarily to Nigeria; lower
cotton production; and lower foreign direct investment. After a sluggish first quarter largely
resulting from uncertainty in the run up to the Presidential election, growth in 2011 is expected
to rebound to 3.8 percent.

 2.10 Higher growth over the remainder of 2011, post first quarter, is the result of a rebound
in agriculture, post-flood reconstruction activity, an increase in private and public investment
after the elections, and stronger regional growth, particularly in Nigeria where growth is
estimated at 7.0 percent in 2011.

 2.11 Regional re-export and transit trade is a mainstay of the economy (much of it
informal), accounting for 20 percent of GDP and 25 percent of government revenues. Trade
through Benin destined for and coming from neighboring countries has slowed over the past

                                                3
couple of years, particularly re-export trade to Nigeria. Trade liberalization in Nigeria appears to
be the main factor. Nigeria’s restrictive trade policies, including import bans on certain goods
(used cars, used clothing, edible oil, tires, etc.) and high tariff rates on others (rice, tobacco,
alcohol, etc.) creates profitable opportunities for importing these goods into Benin and then re-
exporting them informally to Nigeria. This trade generates significant import duties for Benin.
The reduction in some tariffs and the removal of certain quotas and bans in Nigeria in 2009 and
2010 reduced the profitability of this re-export trade. This is estimated to have reduced GDP
growth in Benin by approximately 2 percentage points and significantly affected fiscal revenues.

 2.12 The economy also remains heavily dependent on cotton. Cotton is Benin’s largest
single official export, representing typically 25 – 40 percent of annual exports and contributing
to the livelihoods of 50 percent of the population. Production has fallen to about half the level of
its recent high in 2004/05 of 417,000 tons. Estimates for 2011 cotton production are in the range
of 200,000 tons. This can largely be attributed to low world cotton prices (until recently), which
together with the appreciation of the Euro, to which the CFAF is pegged, has depressed domestic
cotton prices. Problems in input markets and less than fully successful reform of the cotton and
agriculture sector have also contributed to falling cotton production. This recent deceleration of
growth due to difficulties in the cotton and re-export sectors, highlights the urgency of deepening
reforms to diversify the economy, strengthen agricultural reform and expand the productive base.

 2.13 The economic slowdown in 2010 was aggravated by the late-2010 floods that caused
estimated damages and losses of over CFAF 125 billion (US$250 million or 4 percent of GDP),
with CFAF 30 billion of the losses and damages in agriculture and CFAF 56 billion in
infrastructure. Over 680,000 people were affected; with 46 deaths and 150,000 left homeless.

 2.14 Inflation, which peaked in 2008 at 8.0 percent during the food/fuel price crises, fell to 2.2
percent in 2009, was 2.1 percent in 2010 and is running at 2.8 percent in 2011. Benin currently

benefits from a Fund program and macroeconomic performance has been satisfactory. HIPC and
MDRI debt relief (2006) has improved the debt and overall fiscal position considerably.

 2.15 The balance of payments position deteriorated from 3.2 percent in 2007 to -1.6 percent of
GDP in 2009, turned positive again in 2010 at 0.8 percent, and is forecast at -1.1 in 2011. Prior
to the current downturn, the external current account deficit (excluding grants) had narrowed
from 10.8 percent in 2007 to 9.0 percent in 2008 despite the increased costs of food and energy
imports. However, the sharp decline in transit and re-export trade and weaker cotton exports in
2009 widened the current account deficit to 11.2 percent in 2009 though it improved to 7.8
percent in 2010 and is forecast to be 8.8 percent in 2011. Access to IMF resources and
additional resources from donors, as well as substantial capital inflows, helped finance the
current account deficit.

 2.16 The overall fiscal deficit deteriorated in 2009, but turned around in 2010. It was -2.8
percent of GDP in 2007, -3.5 percent in 2008, -7.5 percent in 2009 and -3.1 percent in 2010.
Total government revenue declined from 20.6% of GDP in 2007 to 19.6% in 2008 and 18.5% in
both 2009 and 2010. Trade related revenues were the most affected, stagnating in nominal terms
and falling by a full percentage point of GDP in both 2009 and 2010. After an initial expansion
of expenditures in the first half of 2009 as a counter-cyclical response to the global economic
crisis, government spending was severely reduced in the latter half of 2009. Expenditure
systems were shut down and the Government moved to a strict system of matching expenditures
to available revenues – a practice that continued throughout 2010 and into 2011

 2.17 The overall fiscal deficit in 2011 is expected to come in at -4.2 percent with a basic
primary balance of -0.5 percent, though wage bill pressures and possible revenue under-
performance pose not inconsequential risks in this regard. Total revenue is expected to increase
to 18.7 percent of GDP in 2011, though results through the first half of the year, while remaining
on target, indicate that risk to achievement of this target exists. Port reforms have encountered
resistance from within the Customs Administration and revenues under-performed in July,
August and September as a result. The Government remains steadfast however, in proceeding
with these important reforms and has requested Bank assistance in resolving the outstanding
issues with the Customs Administration and in undertaking a Customs performance assessment.

 2.18 A high wage bill (7.3% of GDP and 45% of tax revenue), well above the WAEMU
convergence criteria of 35%, has squeezed other expenditures. Public investment bore the brunt
of expenditure reductions, falling by 4.2% of GDP in 2010. Other measures to contain
expenditures and strengthen the fiscal position included: strengthening tax collection; freezing
expenditure commitments and new bonuses to civil servants; and enforcing more rigorous
controls on expenditure execution. About two-thirds of the deficit was financed from external
grants and concessional loans. Additional financing was also mobilized on the regional market.

 2.19 The effort to reduce expenditures, on top of pre-existing weaknesses in budget planning,
budget execution and procurement, has resulted in very low budget execution rates within line
ministries, many running 50 percent or less. Furthermore, given the non-differentiated nature of
the restrictions and the near total closure of the automated financial commitment and expenditure
system (SIGFIP), priority expenditures and priority investments were as likely, or indeed more
likely, to be constrained as non-priority expenditures.

 2.20 Monetary policy at the regional level responded effectively to the challenges
presented by the global economic crisis. In June 2009 the monetary authorities decided to
reduce the intervention interest rate from 4.75 percent to 4.25 percent and to reduce the required
reserve ratio for Benin from 15 percent to 9 percent. Credit to the private sector increased by
11.3 percent in 2009 owing to rising domestic demand in the second half of the year and
increased by 9.7 percent in 2010.

 2.21 Benin suffered from a Ponzi scheme scandal in the microfinance sector in mid-2010.
Initially, a single large unregistered microfinance institution offered quarterly rates of return on
deposits in excess of 25 percent. This was then copied by other unregistered institutions. In the
end, the scheme unraveled and resulted in the loss of some CFAF 160 billion (US$320 million)
by approximately 150,000 depositors. This represents an average loss of some US$2,000
equivalent per depositor. Fortunately, despite the scale of the fraud, the crisis was relatively
well-contained. The broader banking system does not appear to have been affected and
traditional microfinance institutions also seem to have suffered little adverse impact. The
resultant direct drop in savings suffered by the losses incurred may have affected consumption
and investment and may at least partially explain reduced domestic demand in 2010. The
Government has not used public funds to reimburse depositors. Reimbursement of depositors
continues in 2011, though on a limited scale, as asset recovery has been minimal. The
Government is trying to focus reimbursement on the smallest and poorest depositors.

 2.22 In sum, Benin has maintained positive economic growth outcomes and a broadly stable
macro environment despite having to confront significant challenges. Unfortunately however,
economic growth has been slower than hoped for. Inflation has been controlled and price
stability well-maintained despite pressures to the contrary. The Government also proceeded with
important structural reforms, though more could have been accomplished and significant

                                                          6
challenges remain to be addressed if growth is to reach meaningful levels and the Government’s
desire to place Benin firmly on the path to emerging economy status is to be realized.

B    MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

 2.23 The medium-term macroeconomic outlook (2011-13) is based on the assumption of a
steady recovery and a modest rebound from the 2010 flood. Growth is expected to increase to
3.8 percent in 2011, 4.3 percent in 2012 and level off at 5.0 percent thereafter. This is contingent
on global economic conditions and strengthened government performance on necessary
structural reforms to improve competitiveness, investments in infrastructure and productive
capacity, sound fiscal performance, improved efficiency of spending, and the provision of
ongoing donor support in meeting Benin’s financing needs. While risks to this growth trajectory
are real, there is unrealized potential for achieving more ambitious growth performance should
global conditions become more favorable, should there be positive exogenous shocks, or should
the Government undertake a more ambitious, effective and efficient reform effort.

 2.24 Benin has significant comparative advantages in agriculture and, given its key
geographic position, also in commerce and trade. In this regard, capitalizing on its
comparative advantage in agriculture through agricultural diversification and a reinvigoration of
cotton will be important, as will positioning Benin as a cost-effective, transparent and well-
governed economy with a strong business and investment climate that can increasingly serve
regional markets, particularly Nigeria. The Government is proceeding with structural reforms
intended to strengthen competitiveness and improve the business climate. In this regard Benin
could potentially be to Nigeria as Singapore to South East Asia, or perhaps Botswana to
Southern Africa. Effectively tapped, building on these comparative advantages could lift
Benin’s growth rate significantly above current projections.

 2.25 The return to an environment of higher global food prices could also be positive for
agricultural production and growth. Food production responded positively during the
previous food price hike, with a notable shift from cotton into food crop production. For
example, maize production increased 23 percent from 2008 to 2009 and rice 37 percent, while
cotton production fell over 20 percent. The supply response will depend to some extent on
effective management of agricultural input markets and value chains. Furthermore, higher food
production need not be at the expense of cotton production and with world cotton prices having
increased markedly, farmers should respond with higher production, if supported by further
reforms. Indeed, initial planting estimates for 2011 indicated some 347,000 hectares under
cotton, which would have resulted in over 350,000 tons of production. Unfortunately, dry
weather in early June led to a slowdown in planting and in the end only 187,000 hectares were
planted for an estimated 2011 cotton production level of 200,000 tons.

 2.26 The Government has agreed to a three-year ECF arrangement with the IMF as
approved by the IMF Board in June 2010. The first program review, which was scheduled in
September/October of 2010, was not completed. Under-performance on revenues and an
inability to fully contract expenditures led to a missed quantitative performance criterion (net
domestic financing). The review was resumed in January 2011 and with demonstrated progress
on the revenue front, and having further restricted spending, including having the final wage bill


                                                 7
come in under target, the first review was completed and a waiver of the missed performance
criteria was granted by the IMF Board on February 16, 2011.

 2.27 The second IMF review was completed in July 2011 and presented to the IMF Board
on September 7, 2011. All performance criteria and all but one indicative target were met. As
such, Benin has an on-track program with the IMF and the macroeconomic policy framework
provides an adequate basis for the purposes of this operation. The IMF relations note is attached
as Annex 3.

 2.28 The greatest risk to near-term fiscal performance is further wage expansion. In
April 2011 the Government granted a 25 percent wage increase to Ministry of Economy and
Finance employees. This was subsequently rejected by the Constitutional Court because of its
discriminatory nature. In the wake of this decision, public service labor unions resumed strikes
and work disruptions and the stand-off with the Government on wages intensified. The
Government took a hard line with labor unions and was adamant that the current budget
environment did not allow for any increase in 2011 and 2012 beyond the wage envelope agreed
to under the program agreed to with the IMF.

 2.29 On August 8, 2011 a new agreement was signed, which granted a 25 percent wage
increase to all civil service employees. This increase had immediate effect for Ministry of
Finance employees and is to be phased in over four years for others. Increases of 5 percent per
year would be implemented in 2011 through 2013 and a final increase of 10 percent in 2014.
Managing these substantial increases within the current wage bill envelope will require
commensurate civil service reform measures, hence the focus on civil service reform in this
operation, and the next, and the stated commitment by the Government to proceed with such
reform.

 2.30 Reforms at the Port of Cotonou are encountering resistance from the Customs
Administration and present another important fiscal risk. Customs officials have been staging
strike actions and work slowdowns and the Government has brought in retired Customs officials
to maintain some clearance of goods. Nonetheless, revenue collection has suffered. Customs
revenues were largely in line with forecasts through June, but July, August and September
collections significantly under-performed; August revenues for example coming in at CFAF 18
billion compared to the CFAF 27.5 billion expected. This threatens the attainment of
performance criteria in Benin’s ECF program with the IMF, though is clearly more a
demonstration of commitment and resolve to proceed with reform rather than reflective of under-
performance on the part of the Government. Despite the difficulties being encountered, the
Government has maintained its resolve to proceed with necessary Port reform.

 2.31 Inflation is projected to remain below the WAEMU convergence criterion of 3
percent over 2010-2012. The BCEAO is expected to continue to use a prudent interest rate
policy to keep inflation under control and maintain a comfortable level of international reserves.
However, the import verification program which began in August 2011 and introduced a new
import valuation mechanism based on real import prices, may lead to potential price increases
for some essential goods, as witnessed in August 2011. The government took transitional
measures to mitigate this risk by postponing application of the new valuation system on 14
essential goods.

                                                8
 2.32 Fiscal consolidation is intended to create the fiscal space necessary to increase priority
spending while reducing budget deficits. Measures will be implemented to improve the
mobilization of domestic revenues while more rigorously managing public expenditure.
Projections indicate total revenues averaging just over 19 percent of GDP over the 2011-2013
period. This is to be accomplished through efforts to expand the tax base, strengthen tax and
customs administrations, and combat fraud, including more specifically: tax and customs
administration reform, computerization of tax services, implementation of the “guichet unique?,
strengthening import verification measures, installation of scanners at the port, and limiting
exemptions. Expenditures will be targeted to support growth and poverty reduction and average
22.8 percent over 2011 to 2013. This will take place in the context of plans to improve public
financial management, enhance capacity to absorb resources, improve the quality of expenditure
with a focus on improving control of recurrent expenditures, particularly the wage bill, and a
greater focus on priority spending. Furthermore, civil service reform is proceeding with a review
of civil service remuneration, a stock taking and evaluation of current and recent civil service
reforms measures and the resultant preparation of a comprehensive civil service reform strategy.

 2.33 Fiscal performance to date in 2011 is commendable, though budget execution rates
remain low and revenues somewhat soft. Revenues up to June 2011 are in line with ECF
program targets. Meeting revenue projections over the second half of the year however, may be
more difficult. Second half projections imply considerable increases over current levels as they
reflect typical seasonality in revenues and, more importantly, the expected positive impact of
several reforms and revenue measures instituted over the course of the year, including the impact
of the Guichet Unique, the import verification program, extension of the TIN, reductions in
exemptions, etc. In response to the on-target, but relatively soft revenue performance,
expenditures have been well-controlled and budget execution rates remain low, though not as
low as in previous years at this point. As a result, deficit measures are in-line with projections
and targets.

 2.34 HIPC and MDRI debt relief helped reduce Benin’s debt stock from 47 percent of GDP at
end-2002 to 19.4 percent currently. The latest DSA update (July 2011) confirms that Benin
faces a low risk of debt distress.

 2.35 Admittedly, there is some lack of clarity going forward. What is certain is that the
situation remains difficult and that challenges exist. There are downside budget risks,
particularly in realizing ambitious customs revenues and around worrisome recent wage
concessions – wage concessions that will have to be met with commensurate civil service reform
efforts to remain within established wage bill ceilings. While the Government appears
committed to such reform, as evidenced by the stand-off with the Customs administration,
effective implementation will be key.

C    ASSESSMENT OF PROGRESS UNDER THE POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY (SCRP I AND II)

 2.36 Benin remains a low income country with per capita income of $680. With a Human
Development Index of 0.435 Benin finds itself situated 134th out of 169 countries in the 2010
Human Development Report. Despite moderate economic growth, progress in terms of poverty
reduction has been limited. The incidence of poverty at the national level is estimated to be 35
percent (2009) as compared to 37 percent in 2006. As is typical, this aggregate figure masks

                                                9
important urban-rural and regional differences. Rural poverty in 2009 was 38.4 percent while
the urban figure was 29.8 percent. Regionally, there is a 13 point spread between the poorest and
the least poor Department (Alibori with a 43 percent incidence of poverty and Littoral at 30.4
percent). Differences are even more stark at the commune level where the difference between
the poorest commune (Banikoara) and the least poor (Adjarra) is 34 percentage points.

 2.37 Nonetheless, social indicators have been improving, particularly in the areas of
education, water and to a lesser extent health. Between 2003 and 2009 primary school
enrolment increased by more than 16 percentage points and primary school completion rates
improved from 49 to 65 percent. Despite these achievements, regional disparities, gender
disparities and the quality of education remain outstanding priorities if education MDGs are to be
met. For example, females represent 46 percent of all students enrolled in primary school and
female completion rates are 57 percent compared to the overall completion rate of 65 percent.
These outcomes are considerably below SCRP II established targets of 77 percent for overall
primary school completion and 70 percent for female primary school completion rate.

 2.38 Considerable progress has been made in the provision of potable water as rural
access to potable water has increased from 36 percent in 2003 to 57.2 percent in 2010 (58.5
percent in urban areas), putting Benin on the path to achievement of the MDG concerning water.
This is the result of using more programmatic approaches, greater decentralization in the water
sector and important Government measures in improving sectoral capacity. Nonetheless, further
progress in this area will depend on the availability of additional resources and increased local
community engagement.

 2.39 Health sector indicators have also improved, but not to the extent experienced in
education and water. Maternal and child mortality have declined – maternal mortality falling
from 474.4 per 100,000 live births in 2002 to 397.0 in 2007 and child mortality falling from 160
per 1,000 births in 2001 to 148 in 2007. Also, at less than 2 percent, the prevalence of
HIV/AIDS is among the lowest in the region. Despite this moderate progress, most health
indicators fall below MDG targets.

 2.40 Achieving the MDGs will require higher and more stable growth and a significant
improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of public service financing and delivery.
Poverty and social indicators indicate that results under SCRP I and SCRP II were moderate.
Even if macroeconomic performance was satisfactory, economic growth remained nonetheless
too low for meaningful progress towards the MDGs.

         3.    THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

 3.1 SCRP (2011-2015) represents Benin’s third PRSP. It considers progress achieved
under the prior PRSPs and largely reconfirms and furthers the objectives elaborated in SCRP II.
As such, it builds on the successes and addresses the failures and constraints encountered in
implementation of the previous PRSPs. The over-riding objective is to improve the quality of
life in Benin and to place Benin firmly on the road to emerging market status. Achievement of
the MDGs is seen as attainable in water and sanitation, primary education and primary health
care with some progress envisaged toward the other MDGs. The pillars identified are the same
as in the previous PRSP: (i) accelerate economic growth; (ii) infrastructure development; (iii)
strengthen human capital; (iv) promote good governance; and, (v) balanced and sustainable
regional development.

 3.2 The PRSP emanates from long term national visions contained in the National Study
of Long Term Perspectives (ENPLT), Benin Alafia 2025 and builds on the Strategic
Development Orientations (OSD) outlined by the Government in 2006. These strategic
documents were the product of extensive consultations within the country. The SCRP (2011-
2015) operationalizes the OSD through the preparation of the associated Priority Action Plan
(PAP) and the MTEF. The SCRP itself was the result of a participative process. Consultations
were undertaken at the national and departmental levels and thematic groups comprised of
government officials, civil society, private sector and donor representatives were established.
The output of these groups served as the foundation for the drafting of the SCRP (2011-2015).
Workshops were held to evaluate, consider and ensure effective inclusion of cross-cutting

                                                      11
themes such as gender, HIV/AIDS, demographics, environmental considerations and human
rights. The process however, was not immune to criticism from civil society and many felt that
the level of engagement could have been broader and deeper. While some groups expressed
concern that their voice was not fully heard or heeded, this is perhaps unavoidable.

 3.3 The macroeconomic framework associated with SCRP (2011-2015) is based on a
scenario that envisages acceleration in economic growth to 7.5 percent by 2015, rising from 2.6
percent in 2010 – an average of 6 percent over the period. This is 2 percentage points higher
than the level of ambition stated in SCRP II – a level not attained. While growth approaching
7.5 percent is necessary to attain the MDGs, this is a rate of growth that has no historical
precedence in Benin. The alternative scenario expressed in the SCRP is based on a 5.2 percent
average growth rate that, while more realistic, still exceeds growth targets forecast in the ECF
program. While ambitious in its objectives and perhaps optimistic in its forecasts, stated goals
could be considered attainable, but only if accompanied by a similarly ambitious commitment to
meaningful reform and effective and timely implementation. Improved results and historically
high growth rates will not be achieved in an environment of business as usual. Meaningful
changes in outcomes will require meaningful changes in behavior.

 3.4 The level of resources needed to implement the SCRP (2011-2015) as identified in the
Priority Action Plan (PAP) is similarly ambitious and optimistic. The PAP outlines the
investments and priority actions that emanate from the SCRP and will be updated annually. It is
coherent with the PIP and reinforces the program-based budgets developed by line ministries.
The PAP serves as the link between the SCRP, the sector-based program budgets, the national
budget and the MTEF, the latter of which will also be updated annually on a three year rolling
basis. Unfortunately, the PAP, while providing the necessary detail rendering the SCRP
actionable, arrives at costed resource levels in excess of the annual national budget. As such, it
is insufficiently prioritized to inform allocation decisions in the context of limited resources.

 3.5 As noted, the pillars remain identical to those of the SCRP II, but are reinforced and
extended to consider new challenges and constraints confronting the country. This extends to
greater consideration of crucial development challenges such as: youth and female employment;
the opening up of new agricultural production zones and activities; the promotion of rural
economic growth; the reduction of gender inequalities; and social protection needs.
Furthermore, themes such as rural organization, agricultural diversification, demographic
challenges and adaptation to climate change have been more meaningfully incorporated.

 3.6 Pillar 1: Accelerate Economic Growth. Economic growth remains too low to meet the
fundamental development needs of the population, particularly in light of high population growth
(3.2 percent). The SCRP notes that poor performance is largely due to the lack of economic
diversification and an uncompetitive economy. The Government is determined to accelerate
reforms in order to encourage economic diversification and raise growth. Four priority areas are
identified: (i) the provision of a stable macroeconomic framework; (ii) fostering a more dynamic
and competitive private sector; (iii) encouraging economic diversification; and (iv) furthering
regional integration and global engagement.

 3.7 Pillar 2: Infrastructure Development. Economic infrastructure plays a key role in the
development process. It links producers to markets, reduces factor costs, improves economic

                                               12
competitiveness and provides essential services, such as potable water, electricity, sanitation
services, communications services, and as such simultaneously improves both economic growth
and the quality of life. Five priority areas are identified: (i) transportation infrastructure; (ii)
energy infrastructure; (iii) information and communication technologies infrastructure; (iv) water
and sanitation infrastructure; and (v) housing and urban development infrastructure.

 3.8 Pillar 3: Strengthening Human Capital. Despite the progress over the course of SCRP
1 and 2, economic growth was not sufficient to respond to the social needs of a rapidly growing
population. Should population growth continue at this pace, stronger efforts will be required in
human resource development and in providing access to basic social services -- not only to
extend services to an ever increasing population, but also to strengthen human capital as the
fundamental building block for medium and long term economic growth. Six priority areas are
noted: (i) controlling population growth; (ii) provision of education services; (iii) improvement
in the health and nutritional status of the population; (iv) creation of decent employment; (v)
reduction of gender inequalities; and (vi) strengthening social protection and social safety nets.

 3.9 Pillar 4: Promote Good Governance. Good governance is essential to overall success
of the SCRP, to the creation of a private sector environment that can more effectively contribute
to national development, to improving the quality of public spending, and to the effectiveness of
Government programs and services. The government has stated its commitment to reinforcing
the quality of governance in Benin in order to improve public sector effectiveness and efficiency.
Priorities include: (i) strengthening public financial management; (ii) strengthening public
administration; (iii) strengthening political governance and processes; (iv) strengthening
statistical capacity; (v) promoting improved environmental governance; (vi) promotion of peace
and security; and (vii) promotion of human rights and the legal capacity of the poor.

 3.10 Pillar 5: Balanced and Sustainable Regional Development. Truly national economic
development and meaningful poverty reduction requires an approach that leads to a balanced
development path across all regions of the country. As such, the SCRP seeks to develop local
resources and local potential as the building blocks of wealth and employment creation and to
reduce spatial inequalities in the provision of infrastructure services. This includes reforms in
the areas of decentralization/deconcentration, regional development, land management and
environmental protection. Priorities include: (i) strengthening the decentralization and
deconcentration processes; (ii) strengthening regional and local planning; (iii) land reform; (iv)
promotion of frontier areas; (v) strengthened environment and natural resource management; and
(vi) improved natural disaster risk management.

    4.   BANK GROUP’S SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S POVERTY REDUCTION
                                   STATEGY

A    LINK TO CAS AND STRATEGY FOR AFRICA

 4.1 The PRSG will continue to be the key instrument in the Bank's dialogue with
Government and development partners on policy issues. The CAS for FY09-12 (Report No
46485 - BJ), discussed by the Board on February 26, 2009, restates the importance of relying on
a combination of development policy and investment operations in order to encourage a coherent
approach to supporting structural reforms. The CAS explicitly includes PRSCs as a key IDA
                                                13
instrument for supporting Benin's SCRP and in addressing the Government's request for donor
harmonization around a common set of measures in key reform areas.

 4.2 In supporting the Government’s plan, the CAS in turn is structured around three main
strategic objectives:

       (i) Strengthening competitiveness and accelerating private sector-led growth, which
       addresses priority areas 1 and 2 in the SCRP;
       (ii) Improving access to basic services, in support of SCRP priority area 3; and,
       (iii) Promoting better governance and strengthening institutional capacities, which
       responds to SCRP priorities 4 and 5.

 4.3 The proposed PRSG-7 is an integral part of the CAS. PRSG-7 would provide
programmatic support for direct implementation of the Government's reform agenda in two of
the key areas targeted by the CAS, namely: (i) strengthening competitiveness and accelerating
private sector-led growth; and, (ii) promoting better governance and strengthening institutional
capacities. The third CAS priority of improving access to basic services will be indirectly
supported by PRSG-7 through efforts to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public sector
administration and hence more effective and targeted delivery of basic services to the public,
particularly the poor.

 4.4 The link to the Bank’s Strategy for Africa is clear and direct. The strategy identifies
governance and public sector capacity as its foundation and notes: “. . . underlying Africa’s many
development problems is the challenge of governance and political leadership. Competitiveness
is constrained by restrictive business regulations that are difficult to remove because of vested
interests. Infrastructure—often considered another binding constraint—is itself impeded by poor
public investment choices, weak budget management, corrupt or lethargic procurement practices,
inefficient public utilities, and regulations that prohibit entry into the trucking industry or keep
electricity tariffs below sustainable levels.? This PRSG focuses directly on governance issues in
these very areas (budget management and procurement) while also fostering increased
competitiveness through agricultural diversification, strengthening of the business climate, and
through key reforms in the port and transport sectors.

B    COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

 4.5 Benin is considered only moderately aid dependent, as compared to other low-
income countries, including those in the region. Over the 2004-2009 period aid represented
approximately 4.5 percent of GDP and 25.2 percent of total government receipts, placing Benin
below the average for francophone West Africa. (See Figure 4-1) Aid typically finances about
20 percent of total government expenditures and close to 47 percent of public investment.

        Source: National Authorities and World Bank staff estimates.

 4.6 There has been a significant movement toward more programmatic aid. Up until
2003 project aid represented fully 86 percent of all external aid – 3.4 percent of GDP. Beginning
in 2004 however, program-based aid started to play an increasingly important role as more
donors began to support the SCRP through direct budget support. Between 2004 and 2009
budget support increased to 46.9 percent of all aid flows to Benin, while project-based aid
declined to 53.1 percent. In 2009 direct budget support accounted for 2.9 percent of GDP,
particularly due to Vflex funds from the EU in response to the global economic crisis. This level
of budget support fell in 2010 to 1.6 percent of GDP as EU aid returned to more normal levels.

 4.7 Relations with the IMF in Benin are strong and constructive. IMF program review
missions are presented as joint Fund/Bank missions and Bank participation is integral to these
review missions. Structural benchmarks and performance criteria included in the IMF program
are not only coordinated and coherent with PRSG prior actions, but also with policy and reform
related activities associated with investment operations and AAA work. The IMF has been fully
consulted in the preparation of this PRSG and has made substantive contributions.

 4.8 Donor coordination is Benin is well-developed, particularly around the provision of
budget support. There is a joint MOU between the donors and the Government governing
budget support. The Bank ascribes to this instrument and is a full participant in joint donor
activities in Benin around the provision of budget support. The identification mission was
carried out in the context of a joint donor review of Benin’s SCRP. This latest review (June 22-
29, 2011) included: (i) discussions, review and revisions of the common policy and results
matrix as well as the main performance indicators; (ii) the formulation by donors of coordinated
comments on the SCRP progress report; (iii) preparation and presentation to the Government of a
consolidated set of comments on the Government’s SCRP (2011-2015) document and joint
discussion with the Government of related issues, including the PAP and MTEF; (iv) discussions
on major policy areas, notably public financial management, private sector development,
governance, decentralization and civil service reform; and, (v) joint preparation
(donor/bank/government) of a comprehensive aide memoire identifying agreed-to policy and

                                                     15
reform action. The donor community in Benin was consulted in the preparation of this PRSG
and the document has benefited from their substantive comments.

C    RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

 4.9 Several ongoing and planned projects are direct complements to this operation and
provide financial and technical assistance and institutional capacity building in mutually
reinforcing areas. In private sector development, the ongoing IDA/IFC Competitiveness and
Integrated Growth Opportunity Project (CIGOP, US$25 million) is helping improve the business
climate, provide the needed infrastructure for private sector development and promote enterprise
development. The business environment and investment climate reforms identified in this PRSG
will help reinforce and strengthen the policy environment in which this initiative is operating and
enhance its effectiveness. IFC technical assistance may also directly help the Government in
proceeding with and implementing some of these reforms measures.

 4.10 The Abidjan-Lagos trade and transport facilitation project (US$75 million for
Benin) addresses trade facilitation bottlenecks identified along the corridor and should increase
the country's competitiveness. The IFC is also providing advisory services to promote sound
PPP arrangements at the port. Given the predominant role of trade and commerce in Benin’s
economy, this investment project and the related reform measures in this PRSG are seen as key
to increasing private sector competitiveness in Benin and are mutually reinforcing.

 4.11 In the agriculture sector, the Emergency Food Security Support Project (US$9
million) implemented under the Global Food Crisis Response Program is supporting the
implementation of the Emergency Food Security Program prepared by the Government in
response to the food price crisis. The project supports Government efforts to boost food
production by subsidizing the provision of fertilizer to about 50,000 producers of rice and maize.
The recently approved Agricultural Diversification Operation (US$31 million) will support the
development of promising agriculture subsectors and value chains and improvements in the
productivity of food crops. The reform measures included in this PRSG emanate directly from
these investment projects and are seen as critical to enhancing the agricultural diversification and
food security objectives of these investment operations.

 4.12 While PRSG-7 does not directly focus on social service delivery, it will impact service
delivery through improved public financial management and civil service reform. Weaknesses
in public financial management, procurement processes, financial planning and budgeting,
budget execution and in civil service management and capacity, all affect the implementation
and performance of investment operations. These are frequently cited impediments not only to
Bank operations, but to projects being implemented by the broader donor community. Efforts
contained in this operation to address these weaknesses will contribute to improved operational
performance across all Bank and donor activities.

 4.13 The HIV/AIDS Multisector Project (US$35 million) aims to increase access to
information and prevention services, increase access to treatment and improve monitoring and
coordination of decentralized activities. The National CDD Project (US$50 million) which was
scaled up with additional financing of US$12 million in FYl0, promotes the use of community-
driven development approaches by line ministries, decentralized local governments and local

                                                16
communities to improve access of the poorest communities to basic social and financial services.
The 2nd Decentralized Cities Project (US$75 million) is helping increase access to infrastructure
and basic services for residents of Benin's primary cities and selected secondary cities while
improving municipal management and community participation. A new FY11 Emergency
Urban Project ($50 million) is scaling up Bank support in the sector with a stronger emphasis on
urban environmental management and urban sanitation. These projects are complemented by
three IDA-managed Trust Fund operations: a US$6 million GEF grant focused on forestry and
land management, a US$4.3 million GEF grant focused on coastal marine biodiversity, and a
US$76 million Education for All/Fast Track Initiative (EFA/FTI) Catalytic Fund grant to support
improved access to and quality of education. An FY11 health system performance grant
(US$22.8 million) will leverage funding from other donors to support a national program for
strengthening demand-side accountability in the health sector (results-based financing of health
care facilities and a national health insurance system). This will receive Additional Financing of
$10 million for scaling up the malaria prevention program initiated under the recently closed
Malaria Booster Project.

D    PROGRESS UNDER PRSC-6 AND THE PREVIOUS SERIES (PRSC 4-6)

 4.14 Progress under Pillar 1 of PRSC 4-6: Improve the regulatory framework and policy
environment for private investment and infrastructure

 4.15 While macroeconomic management has been broadly commendable, progress on
structural reforms has been mixed. Progress has been made in cotton and agriculture sector
reform with the privatization of SONAPRA. Similarly, the sale of several public companies
such as the cement company (SCO), the wood company, the withdrawal of Government
ownership in Continental Bank, and progress on the sale of Benin Telecom, have been positive.

 4.16 Nonetheless, delays have been noted in other important reform areas. Civil service
reform, until recently, has progressed very slowly despite Government recognition of the need
for reform. This effort is rendered more difficult by relatively strong public sector unions and
the inherently political nature of such reforms. On the private sector enabling environment,
Benin has demonstrated little improvement in its Doing Business Indicators (DBI) and as a result
has stagnated in the DBI rankings, rising only to 170 in 2011 from 172 in 2010. Both of these
areas are included as priority areas in PRSG-7.

 4.17 Port reforms have demonstrated increased momentum and significant progress has
been made. This includes the establishment of the “guichet unique?, the streamlining of
import/export procedures, the subcontracting of key port operations to the private sector, reform
of the import verification program, and consolidation of informatics systems. These measures
should improve service to the private sector. Benin already ranks relatively well in the DBI trade
area, 127 of 183 countries. Costs to import and export are low in comparison to African
countries -- $1,400 to import a container compared to the SSA average of nearly $2,500 and
$1,250 to export a container compared to a SSA cost of $1,960. Nonetheless, the required scale
of effort in this area, particularly around the Guichet Unique, should not be underestimated.
Occasional setbacks and changes to planned timelines should be expected.



                                               17
 4.18 Momentum for reform has been strengthening in other areas as well, namely: (i) a
financial audit of SBEE and the restructuring of the national electricity company; (ii) the
development of a new regulatory framework for the electricity sector that will enable private
sector participation in the generation and distribution of electricity; and (iii) extension and
utilization of the individual tax payer identification system.

 4.19 Progress under Pillar 2 of PRSC 4-6: Pursue progress towards the MDGs by
improving access to basic services and ensuring greater efficiency of public expenditures on
human capital formation.

 4.20 PRSC supported decentralization efforts in the water sector were very successful.
Funds were transferred from the center to local communities and were effectively utilized in the
provision of potable water services to local populations. PPPs were fostered and there is now
significant private sector participation in the delivery of water with over 30 percent of village
water systems managed under PPP arrangements. Targets for access to potable water in rural
areas were exceeded, while targets in urban areas were basically met – both now over 50 percent.
This is one area where Benin is likely to meet its MDG target.

 4.21 Progress in education and health were more ambiguous. The notable progress
achieved in 2007 and 2008 on key health sector outcome indicators was mostly sustained in 2009
and 2010 though not improved upon. The utilization rate of basic health services by the general
population slightly improved, from 45.6 in 2008 to 46.1 in 2009/10, while the utilization rate by
children under-five stagnated around 76 percent. Immunization coverage for children under 11
months increased from 94.2 percent in 2008 to 98 percent in 2009/10. The proportion of
deliveries attended by health personnel remained stable at 78 percent. C-sections increased from
4% of deliveries in 2007 to 5.2% in 2009/10 -- a result of the free c-sections policy implemented
in April 2009. Overall however, limited progress was made in improving the performance of the
health sector. Health workers have spent many days on strike, sometimes without providing
emergency care. More generally, the issues facing the health sector continue to be in the
following areas: (i) persistent management capacity weakness within the MoH at the central and
decentralized levels; (ii) poor quality of services provided in public health facilities; (iii) lack of
skilled health personnel in poor/remote areas; (iv) lack of equipment, pharmaceutical and
medical consumables needed to improve the health status of the population especially in poor
areas; and (v) poor governance in the sector. On a positive note, the MOH has decided to extend
the hygiene and basic sanitation marketing approach, supported on a pilot basis under the PRSC-
6, to the twelve departments of the country. The ultimate goal being to help prevent the
recurrent upsurge of diseases such as cholera and diarrhea that particularly effect children under
five. The coverage rate of household latrines reached 37.9 percent, against a target of 37 percent,
while the coverage at school level stands at 67.3 percent, against an objective of 66 percent.

 4.22 In education, enrollment has increased over the last few years, but there has been a
decrease in the primary completion rate. Pre-school enrolment also increased, from 4.5
percent in 2006-07 to 8.0 percent in 2008-09. The gross enrollment rate in primary education
increased from 98.5 percent in 2006-07 to 109 percent most recently, following the free basic
education policy. Girls’ participation improved from 92 percent to 104.5 percent. Gender parity
is progressing with girls representing 46 percent of total primary education enrolment compared
to 44.4 percent in 2005-06. Despite this progress in access, the PCR decreased from 66 percent

                                                  18
in 2006-07 to 65 percent in 2009, lagging behind the target of 70 percent (in part due to the
sudden increase in the schooling population and the increase in the repetition rate). As a result,
Benin is not on track to meet the MDG related to PCR. In line with SCRP priorities and PRSC
outcome indicators, the Government has continued to allocate an increasing share of its budget to
the sector and to implement its free primary education policy adopted in October 2006.

 4.23 Progress under Pillar 3 of PRSC 4-6: Promote better governance through public
financial management reforms.

 4.24 The Government has made progress in strengthening PFM. A new procurement code
was adopted by the National Assembly though the regulatory framework rendering the new code
effective has yet to be fully implemented. The decrees related to establishing the regulatory
framework are included in PRSG-7 as prior actions. Full implementation of the procurement
reforms will also require the extension of procurement training to all priority ministries. During
the PRSC 4-6 period, the Government completed the audit of electronic public expenditure
systems and prepared a comprehensive action plan to strengthen public finance management
based on the findings of the 2007 PEFA. The use of exceptional procedures was reduced as was
the backlog on external audits. Progress was also made in the areas of internal and external
audits with the implementation of a "harmonized" program of audits by internal oversight
structures and the preparation of an action plan to further close the backlog in budget execution
laws, which are now being executed according to an agreed schedule. Despite these positive
steps, further improvements in PFM are needed. In particular, budget execution procedures need
to be streamlined, public procurement capacities strengthened and effectiveness of internal and
external audit institutions increased.

Lessons Learned

4.25 There are a number of lessons that can be learned from the previous PRSC 4-6 series and
which can be applied in this case. These include:

 4.26 It is clear that policy actions are often not enough to effect significant and
sustainable change. While specific policy actions may be necessary to create an environment
conducive to change, additional enabling interventions are also frequently required. Over the
past PRSC series it was found that greater impact was achieved by increasingly focusing prior
actions and triggers in those areas where there was significant Bank complementary action in
terms of investment operations or TA operations, or in some cases complementary donor
activities that were closely aligned with PRSC areas of focus. The Bank and donors are
particularly involved in the areas noted in this PRSG, namely, strengthening public financial
management and administration, decentralization, agricultural diversification, energy sector
reform and strengthening and improving the private sector enabling environment.

 4.27 In line with the previous point, a PRSC series can be more effective if the reform
agenda supported by the series goes deeper rather than broader. In addition to including
key policy actions in the operation, it may be beneficial if supporting actions, those related to
implementation measures or second generation reforms associated with the initial policy action,
are also included in the operation. Focusing on fewer areas, but ensuring more fulsome and
meaningful reform can improve effectiveness. This current PRSG is more focused than previous

                                               19
series and efforts have been made to design prior actions such that a subsequent series can
support a progression of triggers/actions that ensure a deep and meaningful reform effort.

 4.28 Coherence across prior actions and triggers is also important to ensuring the
effectiveness and sustainability of supported reforms. Actions and triggers should be
designed as a coherent, mutually reinforcing package of reforms that together contribute to
intended results rather than as a disparate number of individual actions each with its own
individual targeted result. Synergy between actions can be important to strengthening outcomes
and ensuring sustainability. Actions in this operation have therefore, been proactively designed
and selected to complement each other and to present a logical package of reforms, not a series
of loosely connected, separate reforms.

 4.29 This coherence extends to engagement, cooperation and coordination with other
donors. The previous series benefited from significant donor cooperation and coherence, which
strengthened donor influence with the Government and allowed for more effective engagement
with the authorities. It also eased the burden on Government as coordinated joint reviews
allowed for single undertakings on the part of the Government. The established donor
engagement process will continue, including joint annual reviews of progress, joint quarterly
meetings with government, and joint adherence to a mutually agreed upon results matrix.

 4.30 Strong links to the Government’s SCRP were critical to ensuring local ownership of
the reform agenda and successful implementation of reforms supported by the operation.
Experience with the previous series served to confirm that local ownership is a key determinant
to the effectiveness of policy operations. Those areas that were clearly and closely aligned with
the SCRP, and were fully reflected in the Government’s budget, realized greater success. The
current PRSG is directly in-line with the SCRP (2011-2015) and prior actions completely reflect
associated Government action plans.

 4.31 Obstacles due to administrative resistance to change and lack of capacity should not
be underestimated. Selectivity and simplicity of design are essential to the success of the
operation in such environments, as are attention to and realism about the scope and pace of
reform.

 4.32 Finally, stated objectives and monitored results indicators need to be realistic and
focused on indicators that are attributable to PRSG supported actions. Prior PRSC series
focused on indicators situated at a level where attribution was difficult, if not impossible, and
where a variety of exogenous factors weighed far more heavily on the achievement, or non-
achievement, of results than supported actions.

E    ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

 4.33 The proposed PRSG-7 benefits from several analytical reports. In the area of public
financial management, the 2007 PEFA report and the Government's responding action plan, the
2010 Public Expenditure Review (PER) and the 2011 Analysis of Central Financial Agencies,
undertaken jointly by the World Bank and the UNDP, all provided valuable insight.

 4.34 The 2010 PER provided particularly meaningful insight on issues around budget
execution, particularly on the successes achieved and the remaining challenges facing
                                               20
decentralization. Several recommendations included in the PER are directly reflected as
prior actions. The 2011 Analysis of Central Financial Agencies similarly provided valuable
knowledge in the areas of budget planning, budget execution, auditing and reporting, the role of
the National Assembly in PFM, and consideration of issues more in the political economy sphere
rather than simply focusing on technical budget management and execution practices. This 2011
analysis was also valuable in that its primary mission over-lapped with the IMF Review and the
PRSG-7 mission and significant synergies were achieved. The concerted and simultaneous
effort allowed for more in-depth engagement with the authorities, between the missions and with
the donor community. Finally, the Government’s 2009 report entitled, “An Action Plan for
Improving Public Financial Management 2009-2013? served as a basic reference document
concerning the Government’s reform plan, intentions and their understanding of the challenges
facing PFM reform in Benin.

 4.35 In the area of private sector development, useful analysis included the 2005
Investment Climate Assessment (lCA) and the annual Doing Business Reports. These
reports helped identify the major impediments to private sector development in Benin. The 2009
Country Economic Memorandum, which identified the main factors constraining growth and
diversification of the economy. In agriculture, the team contracted a consultant to help identify,
together with the Government, necessary reforms that would be growth enhancing, contribute to
agricultural diversification and that would specifically improve the input supply chain.

 4.36 In public infrastructure, a series of studies on port operations and port productivity
provided input to the Government's port action plan. Input and analysis from World Bank
sector experts integrally involved in related investment operations in the transport, port and trade
areas were invaluable in making the links between investment operations and the policy level.
Such interaction also provided important reality checks on the relevance, impact, ambition and
feasibility of various reforms.

 4.37 Finally, the Government’s 2010 and 2011 reports on performance under SCRP II
were instrumental in understanding where progress had been made, where challenges
remained and where significantly scaled up efforts are required. The related results matrix
was also very useful in tracking progress on key indicators related to the SCRP II, including
many which were relevant to the PRSC 6 and which will be retained for this new PRSG.
Furthermore, the annual donor review process, including detailed sectoral reviews provided not
only detailed insight into individual sectoral results, but the opportunity for joint policy dialogue
with the authorities and often frank and transparent discussion of issues and concerns related to
the Government’s reform efforts. This review process and the subsequent aide-memoires served
as important exercises in donor coordination and the identification of potential problem areas.

              5.   THE PROPOSED SEVENTH POVERTY REDUCTION GRANT

A    OPERATIONS DESCRIPTION

 5.1 The proposed operation, together with other IDA instruments, will support
implementation of the Government’s SCRP (2011-2015). The intention of proceeding with a
single PRSG, following two previous PRSC series, is to allow for demonstration of a credible
and ambitious reform effort following the Government’s new mandate; an ambitious effort that
                                                 21
can then be fully supported by a subsequent PRSG series by ensuring that the reforms introduced
as prior actions in the present operation are meaningfully supported in their implementation
through subsequent operations. This section outlines the proposed PRSG-7 in greater detail and
notes where a subsequent series may support ongoing implementation.

The Overall Framework of the PRSG-7

 5.2 The overall objective is to support implementation of Benin’s Strategy for Growth
and Poverty Reduction (SCRP 2011-2015) adopted in March 2011. PRSG-7 will increase the
focus on improving public sector policy and strengthening public administration (budget reform,
procurement reform, internal control and audit, civil service reform, decentralization, structural
reforms) in order to strengthen and make more effective government efforts to enhance private
sector competitiveness through improved public services.

 5.3 Following the lessons learned, the reforms supported seek to be more narrowly
focused than those supported in prior PRSC series and are also intended to be mutually
reinforcing. For example, the selection of public procurement reform as a subset of public
financial management reform is intended not only to directly strengthen public financial
management, but also to address constraints in the private sector and to improve the business
enabling environment by reducing uncertainty around public procurement and making it more
attractive, more profitable and less risky for private sector firms. Similarly, focusing on reforms
in the port not only improves efficiency of port operations, increases private sector
competitiveness and reinforces Benin’s comparative advantage in trade and commerce, but also
strengthens government capacity, increases customs revenue, improves fiscal sustainability and
enhances transparency in government operations. In this manner the supported prior actions
present a coherent single package of reforms rather than a number of independent reforms across
a number of sectors.

 5.4 PRSG 7 is also complemented by more specific IDA investment operations in the
areas of: competitiveness and growth, particularly agricultural diversification and rural
development efforts; road transport and trade facilitation infrastructure; telecommunications
investments; energy sector infrastructure, regulatory and institutional capacity building efforts;
and, environment and forestry investments. These investments similarly contribute to the
achievement of stated results and cannot be viewed in isolation or as totally separate
undertakings from this PRSG.

Development Objectives

 5.5 The Tier 1 development objective of PRSG-7, in line with Benin’s SCRP, is to
accelerate real economic growth and reduce the incidence of poverty in Benin through focusing
on the following two Tier 2 development objectives or pillars:

   (i)     Strengthened public sector management, administration and policy making through
           meaningful public financial management, civil service, customs, decentralization and
           structural reforms; in order to,
   (ii)    Deliver more effective public services in the pursuit of enhanced private sector
           competitiveness and greater economic diversification.

                                                22
 5.6 Several reasons underpin the choice of policies. The Government’s own poverty
reduction strategy and priority action plan note the over-riding imperative of economic
diversification, notably in agriculture, and the need for improved private sector competiveness.
The 2009 CEM (Report no. 48233-BJ) noted the following four most binding constraints:

    (i)     A distortionary and poorly administered tax system, including complex and lengthy
            customs and trade procedures;
    (ii)    Poor government effectiveness, including contract enforcement, weak institutions and
            corruption;
    (iii)   Costly and unreliable infrastructure services especially electricity, domestic rail and
            road transport, and communication; and,
    (iv)    Firms’ failure to adapt technologies available internationally to local conditions and
            innovate to produce at low enough cost to be profitable and competitive in foreign
            markets.

 5.7 One can note the two primary constraints related to government effectiveness. It is
broadly recognized, and has been amply documented, including in the 2010 PER, the 2010 joint
donor review of budget support, the annual Doing Business Reports, a Diagnostic Trade
Integration Study, and the Government’s own review of SCRP II performance, that government
capacity in implementing policy reforms and delivery of public services, including effective
regulatory environments, an attractive investment climate, and an improved private sector
enabling environment, is of paramount concern. A strengthened focus on governance and
government capacity will help improve transparency, accountability and efficiency in budget
processes, enable centralized authorities and decentralized structures to generate resources
commensurate with their mandate and thus enhance medium-term planning visibility for
effective implementation of sectoral programs and public investments in pursuit of economic
diversification and enhanced private sector competitiveness.

 5.8 Helping Benin capitalize on its comparative advantages, in commerce/trade and in
agriculture, is at the heart of this PRSG. It seeks to strengthen Government capacity and
performance and through supporting an improved public, business and investment climate to
position Benin as a competitive and attractive destination for serving regional markets.

B    PRIOR ACTIONS FOR THE PROPOSED PRSG-7

 5.9 PRSG-7 supports selected reform measures in the Government’s program of
reforms described in its Letter of Development Policy (LDP) (Schedule 1) deemed essential
for success. These measures are consistent with the SCRP (2011-2015) and Priority Action
Plan. Compliance with these prior actions, as defined in the Financial Agreement, forms the
basis for IDA to proceed with the proposed operation. Given that the preceding PRSC-6 was the
last in the PRSC 4-6 series, no triggers were noted in that operation for PRSG-7.

5.10 Table 5.1 presents the prior actions for PRSG-7.

                            Box 5.1: Good Practice Principles for Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
PRSG-7 builds on the foundation of progress achieved during SCRP I and SCRP II and is closely aligned with SCRP
(2011-2015) objectives. Supported reforms are specifically noted in the Priority Action Plan. The preparation of this
operation follows broad-based consultations with central and sectoral ministries, civil society, the private sector, and
financial and technical partners, particularly those donors involved in the provision of budget support. As such, this
PRSG supports policies and programs for which there is clear evidence of strong ownership and commitment on the
part of the Government.
Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework
The supported reforms are summarized in a policy matrix and results framework. The SCRP process and the move
towards more programmatic approaches on the part of the donor community have encouraged a greater level of
coordination between the Bank and development partners providing budget support (AfDB, EU, Denmark, The
Netherlands, France and Switzerland). This has led to improved alignment of donor assistance to Benin's SCRP. On
December 4, 2007, an MOU was signed between the Government and eight development partners providing budget
support with a view to consolidating and formalizing this cooperation. Budget support represents a key instrument in
donor-government cooperation around the implementation of the SCRP and the MOU and donor collaboration
ensures an effective and meaningful coordination of the various donor interventions. Joint annual reviews of progress
under the SCRP, as measured against a jointly agreed matrix of proposed reforms and related indicators remains a
key accountability instrument for both the government and donors. This performance matrix is updated annually
during the joint review to reflect past performance and establish new performance targets going forward. This
process encourages frank discussion of commitments and responsibilities on the side of both the government and
donors. The Bank is a full participant in this process.
Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
In October 2006, the Government announced its strategic orientation for its 2006-2011 Development Plan. These
strategic choices formed the framework for the both the SCRP II and SCRP (2011-2015). The political environment
over the past several years has been characterized by a National Assembly consisting of numerous parties, none
enjoying a majority. This led to the need to be constantly managing shifting coalitions and made meaningful reform
more difficult. Elections in 2011 also limited potential meaningful reform during 2010 and early 2011. Post
elections however, and with the President now enjoying a working majority coalition in the National Assembly, there
is a clear opportunity for more ambitious and more meaningful reform. This single operation, prior to a new PRSG
series seeks demonstration of this commitment. Therefore, Bank support for important policy reforms under this
PRSG is based on a clear understanding of Benin's specific circumstances and the opportunity that now exists for the
implementation of meaningful reforms.
Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
The proposed PRSG includes a set of prior actions embedded in a results framework with specific targets and in strict
coherence with SCRP (2011-2015) objectives. The actions follow logically to results, largely as presented and
determined by the Government. The prior actions are those agreed to with Government as critical to the achievement
of SCRP objectives. The broader donor community, including the IMF, agrees with the criticality of the noted prior
actions.
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support
As agreed with Government, joint SCRP reviews and joint budget support and appraisal missions take place yearly.
In this context, progress in implementing the SCRP and monitoring donor budget support is reviewed regularly,
drawing primarily on Benin’s own monitoring and evaluation cycle. To ensure timely feedback into the
policymaking and budget processes and to strengthen the alignment and harmonization of financial partners support
around Government budget cycles, the authorities and development partners conduct joint missions in June so that the
process can inform the following year’s budget preparation process. Progress has also been made in strengthening
the SCRP results framework and in using clear baseline indicators for results measurement.

Results Framework

 5.11 Table 5.3 presents Tier 1 and Tier 2 indicators used to measure progress in meeting
the objectives of Benin’s SCRP (2011-2015) and the effectiveness of the support provided by
this operation in contributing to these objectives. The indicators included in Table 5.3 are
primarily a sub-set of those as presented in the SCRP (2011-2015) and correspond to the overall
objectives noted in this operation, i.e., economic growth and poverty reduction indicators (Tier
1), as well as more specifically to the individual reform areas which form the focus of this
specific operation (Tier 2), i.e., public financial management indicators, private sector enabling
environment indicators, etc. Some of the indicators reflect those included in the PRSC-6
operation in order to continue to track these results. Recognizing the difficulty in attributing
results to a single operation, as compared to a series of operations over a number of years, the
indicators identified and presented here are done so with some thought to the next PRSG series
to facilitate continued tracking of progress across the next series of operations. Those indicators
in Table 5.3 where baseline figures are missing will be populated as soon as feasibly possible.

 5.12 This PRSG is set within an environment in which development results arise from
the collaborative and harmonized efforts of many actors. Development outcomes are
determined by the efforts of the Government of Benin, the donor community, domestic
stakeholders, institutions, the domestic and foreign private sector, and are influenced by many
exogenous factors as well. Indeed, the World Bank itself will deliver results through several
finance and knowledge instruments. Broad development outcomes cannot be solely attributed to
the influence of this operation or to the World Bank. Not only is attribution difficult, but many
aspects of the transformational agenda related to policy reforms, national systems strengthening,
institutional development, and the governance measures supported by this operation are by
nature long term, unpredictable, and difficult to measure at the development impact level.
Therefore, Tier 1 indicators measure those development outcomes to which the Bank’s work
contributes and has an undeniable impact, but where concrete attribution cannot be identified.

 5.13 Tier 2 indicators are those indicators that can be reasonably attributed to this
operation and related and associated Bank operations, such as a potential subsequent
PRSG series. Annex 2 illustrates the links between the supported policy actions and the
outcome indicators. It must be recognized however, that any and all results achieved reflect the
success of the Government’s efforts, the Government’s programs and the Government’s reform
agenda, as this operation is fully and solely in support of the Government’s own efforts.
Furthermore, prior actions do not map one-to-one to stated results and indicators. For example,
passing the necessary decrees to implement the procurement code will not, as a single prior
action, directly lead to improved budget execution rates. However, passing those decrees,
together with actions to reinforce and strengthen the public expenditure management chain and
strengthen budget planning, should together lead to improved budget execution rates. Similarly,
civil service reforms contribute to, but do not in and of themselves lead to a reduced wage bill as
a percentage of tax revenues. However, civil service reform, together with reforms at the port in
revenue collection, in PFM around computerization of the human resource management and
payment system and its linkage with the public expenditure management system, should together
result in improvement in the wage bill. Proposed actions must be viewed as a coherent package
that collectively contribute to the achievement of stated objectives as reflected in the results
indicators.

C    POLICY AREAS

PILLAR 1: Public Financial Management and Public Administration Budget Planning
and Execution

 5.14 The 2007 PEFA and the 2010 Public Expenditure Review indicate that PFM in
Benin has improved. This improvement has stemmed from reforms to: institutionalize program
budgets, including procedures for their preparation, implementation and control; computerize
budget execution, accounting and reporting; strengthen the design and implementation of
procurement reforms; and improve internal budget control. However, weaknesses remain,
including: a large amount of unallocated funds in the budget; lack of comprehensiveness in
presentation of the budget; weak alignment between sector policies and the budget; poor
management of the wage bill; weak procurement capacity; insufficient monitoring of financial
risks associated with state-owned enterprises and decentralized spending; and difficulties in
obtaining information on budget execution and weak internal and external oversight.

 5.15 In the area of PFM, three main challenges are evident and represent the focus of
reforms under this operation: (i) reinforcing budget planning and strategy to improve budget
credibility and the quality of public spending; (ii) streamlining budget execution and improving
financial reporting; and (iii) strengthening financial accountability. The implementation of the
measures supported by PRSG-7 should lead to measureable improvements in PFM through
comprehensive support to improving budget preparation, execution, reporting and control.

Reinforcing Government planning and strategy to improve budget credibility and the quality of
public spending.

 5.16 Budget credibility is undermined by a disconnect between budgets submitted to and
approved by Parliament and the Government’s international commitments concerning
economic and fiscal policy. In 2009 and 2010 the President had to invoke special orders to
approve the budget in the absence of National Assembly approval. Furthermore, in previous
years the budget proposed to the National Assembly was not in line with the agreed IMF
program and additional amendments made to the budget within the National Assembly further
widened the gap between the economic program and the approved budget. The administration
would then manage the budget and expenditures largely in line with the IMF program – at the
risk of undermining the budget approval process. Since then, progress has been made with the
2011 budget presented to the National Assembly reflecting the program agreed to with the IMF
and the intention is to ensure this is continued in future years.

 5.17 Benin is ahead of most WAEMU countries on MTEF and program budgeting, but
significant weaknesses remain. The co-existence of a traditional budget and a program budget is
another factor contributing to the lack of comprehensiveness of the budget, weak alignment
between sector policies and the budget, and delays in budget execution. The Organic Budget
Law (LOLF) does not incorporate provisions for program budgeting, even though related
reforms have been gradually adopted since 2000. Indeed, while significant progress on program-
based budgeting has been made within line ministries and many ministries produce program-
based budgets, only the traditional budget is submitted to Parliament for approval. As a result,
during the budget preparation process, sector ministries must reconcile the two budgets in order

                                              30
to align with the format submitted to the National Assembly. This reconciliation process
disrupts the timetable at each stage of the budget preparation process. In addition, delays in
preparing the macro-level MTEF results in sector ministries not having sufficient time to prepare
their program budgets and to ensure coherence with the traditional budget.

 5.18 Resolving this problem will require the codification of programs in the budget. This
in turn requires a revision of the current LOLF and of the budget classification decree to
incorporate the reforms related to public finance that have been adopted since 2000. The
Government has initiated a revision of the LOLF and other PFM regulations in order to
incorporate the new directives adopted by WAEMU countries in June 2009, and has submitted
this legislation to the Supreme Court for introduction in the National Assembly. These directives
introduce major PFM reforms and a new legal and institutional framework, including multiyear
expenditure frameworks (MTEF) and program budgeting. Submission of this draft Law to the
Supreme Court is recognized as a prior action in the PRSG-7. Looking forward to a future series
and subsequent operations, future prior actions could include the adoption by decrees of the main
remaining WAEMU regulations, including a new budget classification system, a Government
accounting directive, and creation of a Court of Accounts, again as required by WAEMU
directives.

 5.19 The practice of double budgeting is compounded by the fact that there is no
adherence to a formal calendar for the planning, programming and preparation of the budget.
As a result, line ministries are not fully involved in a timely and effective fashion in budget
preparation. This inhibits the appropriate allocation of resources and limits the effectiveness of
the budget as an instrument of growth and poverty reduction. The Bank will work with the
authorities in helping establish a permanent annual budget calendar.

Strengthening budget execution and improving financial reporting

 5.20 The main challenge to ensuring the PFM system and related reforms support the
objective of sustained growth and poverty reduction will be raising budget execution rates.
The 2004 PER estimated that the variance between realized spending and the voted budget
averaged 20 percent between 1997 and 2003. The 2010 PER indicates that budget execution
rates have worsened, moving from a level of 79.3 percent in 2007 to 70.5 percent in 2009.

 5.21 Low execution rates and poor program monitoring mechanisms have led to an
implicit reallocation away from priority areas of the SCRP (Figure 5-1) and a significant
variance between actual spending and the budget adopted by the National Assembly.
While this has been true for both priority and non-priority areas, the gap in budget execution
rates between non-priority and priority programs has widened. Budget execution rates in priority
programs were being maintained around 80 percent up to 2007, but have fallen since. Execution
rates have been particularly low for technical education and training (61 percent), health (68
percent), agriculture (71 percent), and education (80 percent). These trends have translated to an
average share of priority sector spending in total spending of 51 percent, compared to an average
share of 57.5 in the voted budget. For example, the health sector share in total executed
spending is 7.8 percent against the 9.1 percent allocated in the budget adopted by the National
Assembly.


                                               31
 5.22 Of particular concern is that execution rates for investment spending are
persistently below 70 percent, averaging 63.3 percent between 2008 and 2010. The execution
rate is lower for donor projects (61 percent) compared to internally financed projects (69.8
percent). These low execution rates on investment projects stem from a low capacity to plan and
implement projects and a low capacity in undertaking procurement processes. Aside from
addressing low execution rates, an improved approach for a systematic and rigorous analysis and
prioritization of projects is needed.

         Source: National Authorities and World Bank staff estimates.

 5.23 The Government has adopted a number of reforms to address some of the issues
and constraints identified above. To ensure that priority spending is not compromised, in
conjunction with the IMF program the Government has explicitly identified priority expenditures
in the budget and is monitoring priority spending. Nonetheless, further actions are needed to
ensure budget execution continues to improve.

 5.24 A prior action in this regard is establishment of real-time satellite connection for
budget and accounting data transfer between central government units in Cotonou and
deconcentrated units across the country. The Government has entered into a contract to
establish this real-time data transfer capability. Currently, fiscal and accounting data must be
transmitted personally in hard copy between the center and various remote Government offices
and units. This leads to frequent and long delays in inputting and processing data and accounts,
loss of information, poor quality data and increased risk of corruption or misuse of public
expenditures. The establishment of a communication channel from the accounting information
system (ASTER) to the budgeting system (SIGFIP) is an area of continued discussion for future
operations. This feature would provide budget managers with timely information regarding
payments and expenditures to improve budget execution and monitoring.

 5.25 The streamlining of the public chain of expenditure is also an area of ongoing
discussion. The adoption of a decree governing the use of exceptional payment orders would
limit this procedure, one which disrupts budget execution and weakens internal control. The

                                                      32
preparation and adoption of a cash basis accounting manual would also improve recording of
expenditures and resources and reduce delays in producing the Government’s general accounts.

 5.26 The centralization of budget execution within the Ministry of Finance is excessive
and impedes line ministries from executing their budget and implementing their sectoral
strategies. The inclusion of unallocated funds in the budget, under the control of the Ministry of
Finance, is particularly problematic. While unallocated funds represented 14 percent of the
budget in 2010, they actually represented nearly a quarter of actual government commitments.
High execution rates in the use of unallocated funds by the Ministry of Finance (84 percent),
combined with low execution rates among line ministries, contributed to unallocated funds
totaling 24 percent of government commitments in 2010. Furthermore, the flexibility enjoyed by
the Ministry of Finance in the use of unallocated funds allows the executive, intentional or
otherwise, to avoid returning to the National Assembly for a supplementary budget should
expenditures diverge significantly from the budget – diversions from the budget being
accommodated by unallocated funds. Discussions around limiting the unallocated portion of the
budget provided to the Ministry of Finance to 10 percent of the 2012 draft budget are ongoing.

 5.27 The Ministry of Finance has excessive power to withhold budget provision. Due to
recent shortages in revenue, the Government has resorted to closing down SIGFIP once spending
has reached the level of available resources. With no prior notification this seriously disrupts
budget execution in line ministries. While better matching expenditures to available resources,
this approach is not conducive to improved service delivery. Clearer measures and rules
pertaining to the use of budget withholding by the Ministry of Finance would provide line
ministries with more visibility in their budget execution.

 5.28 Furthermore, line ministries should be permanently empowered to execute their
budget in accordance with the budget adopted by Parliament. Going beyond the current
delegation of the Minister of Finance’s budget authority to line ministries, which remains largely
theoretical, the Government should prepare for the transition to full devolution of budget
authority to all Ministries, consistent with WAEMU directive 06/2009 provisions. A pilot of this
reform in selected line ministries is an area of continuing discussion.

Strengthening financial accountability

 5.29 The 2007 PEFA assessment noted that internal and external oversight institutions
were among the main weaknesses in Benin’s PFM system. Strengthening these institutions
would have a major impact on enhancing the transparency of PFM and in reassuring the donor
community of Government commitment to intensify its fight against corruption. The budget is
publicly available and is published on the Ministry of Finance’s website as are periodic updates
on budget execution.

 5.30 Some progress has been made to reinforce the status and effectiveness of the general
inspectorates and to coordinate their programs in order to avoid duplication. Since 2007,
the Inspection generale d’Etat (State General Inspectorate) has coordinated the planning and
monitoring of internal oversight departments and institutions. However, little has been done to
develop risk-based audit work plans in order to focus activities on high priority objectives.
Furthermore, internal audit is not fully operational in all central government entities in that

                                               33
ministerial inspectorate units remain weak because of their poorly defined legal status and
important capacity constraints. The adoption of a decree assuring auditors’ operational
independence will be considered as a potential trigger for subsequent operations.

 5.31 The independence and professionalism of the Chamber of Accounts of the Supreme
Court should be strengthened. Its effectiveness is limited and the extent of the audit backlog is
of a particular concern. To date, the last budget audited is that of fiscal year 2006. To address
these constraints, the legal framework for the Chamber of Accounts should be refined to assure
its operational independence, enabling this Supreme Audit institution to recruit and retain staff
and to benefit from a public prosecutor specialized in financial audit. As this Chamber is
currently under the oversight of the Supreme Court of Benin, its status is not in-line with
WAEMU regulations and the principles of the Declaration of Lima/Peru on the independence of
Supreme Audit Institutions, which require the creation of an independent Court of Accounts. A
working group has prepared such a draft law. However, revision of the Constitution is needed to
establish a Court of Accounts, which makes the timing of this reform uncertain.

5.32 Prior actions for PRSG-7 are as follows:

  i.   Submitted to the Supreme Court a revised LOLF in line with WAEMU Directive 06/2009
       concerning public finance and budget content, presentation, preparation, adoption,
       execution, and control.

 ii.   Reinforced the public expenditure chain by establishing real-time satellite connection
       between central agencies and their deconcentrated units for the reporting of fiscal
       (SIGFIP) and accounting (ASTER) data.

Procurement

 5.33 A new Procurement Code was passed in August 2009, but it took some time to put the
necessary regulatory framework in place. These decrees have now been implemented and are
recognized as prior actions. Other procurement measures have been undertaken simultaneously,
including the preparation of a manual on public procurement procedures, an appeals procedures
manual, and a guide to assist firms in understanding and accessing the public procurement
process. A feasibility study has also been undertaken on the development of a new Integrated
Public Procurement Management System (SIGMAP), but this has encountered implementation
delays. In terms of ex-ante procurement control, a reference price software system is being
designed and in terms of ex-post control the strengthening of technical supervision skills has
commenced through the training of eleven financial program performance auditors.

 5.34 Maintaining momentum on these procurement reforms is important.                       The
procurement difficulties encountered in the preparation of the Community of Sahel-Saharan
States (CEN-SAD) summit in 2008, the fiscal slippages recorded in 2009, the persistently low
budget execution rates that continued into 2010 and 2011, and long delays encountered in many
public procurement processes have highlighted the need to strengthen procurement practices.

 5.35 Cumbersome, slow and less than fully transparent procurement processes also
significantly affect the public investment program. Not only does this ineffective public

                                               34
procurement add to the cost of public works projects, but needed public investment projects are
frequently delayed for months, or worse, unable to be implemented at all due to long public
procurement delays. This affects not only the use of the Government’s own resources, but also
leads to long delays and low disbursement rates in donor financed investment projects. The
inclusion of a prior action to publish weekly procurement results is intended to render
procurement more transparent and more cost effective. Discussions on future reforms are
focused on further strengthening the auditing and evaluation of procurement processes and
complete implementation of the new procurement code.

 5.36 The public procurement process in Benin is a major constraint to development. The
overlap and synergy with an improved private sector enabling environment is also substantial.
Improving the public procurement process can be a significant enabler for private sector
expansion and improved competitiveness. Engaging in public procurement can be a positive
experience for the private sector in building capacity, gaining needed experience and in growing
their businesses. In discussions with the banking sector, commercial banks in Benin view delays
in public procurement processes, delayed and late payments, and uncertainty around public
procurement as increasing financial risks faced by the private sector in contracting with the
Government. As such, banks are reluctant to lend to private sector interests doing business with
the Government and this leads to many firms being credit constrained.

5.37 Prior actions for PRSG-7 are as follows:

  i.   Consistently published weekly results of public procurement processes commencing May
       2011
 ii.   The following decrees implementing the Procurement Code were adopted:

       A decree determining the responsibilities of the Regulatory Authority for procurement

      A decree determining the responsibilities of the National Directorate of Procurement
Monitoring

       A decree determining the responsibilities of the public procurement officer, the public
procurement commissions and the control panels for public procurement

       A decree defining the level of authority and contracting thresholds for public
procurement

       A decree adopting the code of ethics and values in procurement

       A decree defining the public procurement planning process

Civil Service Reform

 5.38 The wage bill has reached such proportions that civil service reform now demands
political attention. However, reform of the civil service in Benin has been supported by the
Bank and other donors in the past with little success. The sensitive nature of such reforms
requires significant commitment at the highest political level, in addition to the knowledge and

                                              35
capacity required to implement meaningful reform. Technical assistance in the absence of such
commitment has proven ineffective. The fiscal difficulties currently being encountered in Benin
stem, to a considerable degree, from the size of the wage bill and the inability of the Government
to resist continued expansion. These difficulties have now placed civil service reform front and
center.

 5.39 The Government is completing a comprehensive civil service reform strategy --
expected in late-2011. This will build on a remuneration and wage study that will form the basis
for a strengthened public service remuneration and wage policy. The Government is also
undertaking a stock-taking and evaluation of current and recently completed civil service reform
efforts that will be used to inform the strategy. These efforts are being supported both
financially and technically by bilateral donors, particularly Denmark, the Netherlands and
Germany. Following completion and adoption of the resultant civil service reform strategy,
selected key actions included in the strategy will be identified as prior actions and triggers for
subsequent operations to ensure momentum on civil service reform is maintained.

 5.40 An Integrated Human Resource Management Information System (SIGRH) is also
under development as is a national training policy and implementation of multi-year training
plans within ministries. The human resource management system would eventually be fully
integrated into the broader budget execution system with the aim of strengthening the framework
for programming the wage bill within the budget and MTEF process by enabling government to
track the trend and structure of the wage bill. It will also facilitate mid-term corrections as
needed. This effort is being supported with technical assistance from the Bank.

 5.41 The adoption of a public service code of values and ethics is included as a prior
action in PRSG-7 as a first step in instilling a more transparent, accountable and less corrupt
civil service.

5.42 Prior actions for PRSG-7 are as follows:

  i.   Adopted a Code of Values and Ethics for the Public Service

Decentralization

 5.43 Benin has taken steps to increase local spending in an effort to increase the
effectiveness of government spending, both in terms of decentralization (spending planned and
undertaken by local communities or communes) and in terms of deconcentration (spending
devolved to regional levels of national sectoral ministries). Nonetheless, the level of public
expenditures disbursed at the local level is minimal, as centralized expenditures continue to
represent approximately 94 percent of total government expenditures. Despite considerable
spending increases realized by the communes through decentralized efforts, communal spending
having increasing by 47.1 percent between 2004 and 2009, the level of these expenditures
remains low at 4.7 percent of total government expenditures. Of this amount, approximately half
of these expenditures represent transfers from the center and half are financed from own
commune resources. Investment spending is almost 100 percent implemented from the center.
In terms of deconcentrated spending, expenditures undertaken by regional authorities of sectoral
ministries amount to only 1.7%.

 5.44 Reinforcing regional financial autonomy remains an important element in the
decentralization effort, as not only does it allow for more local discretion and local
determination in the allocation of scarce public resources, but it is equally important in ensuring
the effective transfer of responsibilities to the local level and more importantly an effective
exercise of the responsibilities thus transferred. In 2009, total resources available to communes
reached 43.5 billion CFAF, up from 25.2 billion CFAF in 2004. While this represents an amount
slightly higher than other countries in the region, it is well below Anglophone countries in sub-
Sahara Africa where decentralization efforts are much more advanced. An audit of the FADEC
resources transferred, included as a prior action, will help inform and strengthen resource
management, reporting, execution and effective utilization of decentralized resources.

 5.45 Recurrent expenditures make up the bulk of local expenditures, leaving few
resources for investment. Over the 2004-2008 period recurrent expenses constituted 74 percent
of total commune disbursements, while investment expenditures totaled 26 percent, despite a
requirement that communes spend at least 30 percent of their available funds to finance
investment activities. Furthermore, much of the investment that was undertaken was the result of
the availability of donor funds, though these were not distributed equitably across communes.
Of greater concern is the level of local resources devoted to maintenance – a paltry 4.9 percent in
2008. This results in a poor and deteriorating condition of existing infrastructure and constrains
communes from effectively fulfilling one of their primary responsibilities.

 5.46 Budget execution rates at the communal level mirror national trends, if not worse.
As can be noted in Table 4, budget execution rates remain below 70 percent, as compared to 77.9
percent nationally. As was noted at the national level, investment expenditures fare worse, as
investment execution rates are around 54 percent. These rates may seem surprising given the
low level of resources available at the local level, but are explained by serious capacity
constraints. This is aggravated by the low level of predictability of resources from the center.

 5.47 Following the audit supported as a prior action under this operation, future PRSGs
will seek to support an increased level of resource transfers to local levels, greater clarity in
how those levels are determined, greater predictability in their allocation, and increased
transparency and accountability in their use in order to strengthen decentralization efforts.
Following completion of a study to determine appropriate resource transfer levels to
decentralized authorities, ongoing discussions will focus on the formula determining the level
and allocation of transfers. Presently, the allocation of resources to local communities is rather
opaque and a new formula is recommended that will consider poverty levels, specific
municipality needs, capacity, current level of services provided, etc. This should render the
allocation mechanism more transparent and more in line with actual needs.

5.48 Prior actions for PRSG-7 are as follows:

  i.      Completed technical audits with respect to FADEC resources for the years 2008-2009 in
          the 77 communes

Public Sector Governance

 5.49 Combating corruption has been a stated priority of President Yayi since he took
office in 2006. Preparation of anti-corruption legislation has been in the works almost since the
day he was elected President, but the drafting of such legislation took an inordinate amount of
time. The President formed a national commission to prepare the draft legislation and the effort
rapidly gained momentum following his re-election in March 2011. The National Assembly
passed the legislation on August 30, 2011 and represents a key prior action of this operation.

 5.50 The legislation is comprehensive. It addresses all forms of corruption including, fraud,
embezzlement, miss-use of public funds, influence peddling, party and electoral financing,
public procurement, nepotism and favoritism in hiring practices, and provides for stiff penalties;
imposing the stiffest penalties for those in high public office and occupying key positions. The
legislation establishes a National Authority to Combat Corruption made up of 13 representatives,
including members of civil society and the private sector. Although operating with rather
independent powers, this authority will be situated in the Presidency. Some members of
Parliament expressed a desire to see the authority achieve greater independence. A corruption
hot-line that directs callers directly to the Presidency has also been established and its creation
has been communicated publicly.

 5.51 The real test of effectiveness will come in implementation. Consideration will be
given to supporting implementation of this important legislation in subsequent PRSG operations
through the identification of key prior actions and triggers.

                                                         38
 5.52 An integral part of the implementation process is the need for monitoring and
tracking of the enforcement process. This goes beyond the monitoring of traditional
perceptions-based indicators of corruption. These have proven to be highly inaccurate measures
of actual levels of corruption and in the case of Benin probably significantly over-state the level
of actual corruption. As such, indicators have been included that will require that the
Government monitor enforcement by collecting, tracking and providing performance measures
that can be acted upon, i.e., actionable indicators. The inclusion of such indicators and the
resultant need to track them is in itself seen as providing some incentive to effectively implement
the legislation.

5.53 Prior actions for PRSG-7 are as follows:

  i.   Adopted and promulgated the Anti-Corruption law

PILLAR 2: Private Sector Competitiveness and Economic Diversification

 5.54 Benin’s comparative advantages lie largely in its agricultural potential and in its key
geographic location as a conduit for regional trade and commerce. The prior actions address
reforms aimed at strengthening this comparative advantage and allowing the private sector to
more effectively capitalize on these inherent advantages.

Transport, Port and Customs Administration and Reform

 5.55 The transport sector is key to maintaining and strengthening the comparative
advantage Benin enjoys in transit and re-export trade. Effective transportation infrastructure
and services support not only transit and re-export trade, but also the domestic economy and
efforts aimed at economic diversification and regional development. It is thus central to future
economic growth and development.

 5.56 The Port of Cotonou is a tremendously important economic asset in Benin.
Significant reform is underway at the Port, including updated infrastructure, privatization of
operations, streamlining of procedures, and improved coordination and cooperation between the
various entities active in the Port. The Millennium Challenge Corporation is a key player in the
Port and is financing, along with IFC, important infrastructure upgrades, including the
construction of two new wharfs. The construction of these wharfs is underway and attention has
now shifted to the establishment of the “Guichet Unique? (a Single Window). As a public-
private partnership, a private operator (Veritas) has been contracted to build, own and operate the
system. The first phase, which was completed in June 2011, is the development of a
computerized software and hardware system for the one-stop shop. The second phase would
implement the system across several operators, including the Port Autonome de Cotonou,
Société Béninoise de Manutention Portuaire, CNCB, CNERTP, CCIB, shipping agents, freight
forwarders, transporters and banks. Implementation will require that all these operators have
systems compatible with that developed by the operator of the one-stop shop. As such, it will
take some time to strengthen these diverse systems and get all operators connecting to and
functioning through this single compatible system. For smaller operators, access to computer
terminals will be provided through a data center at the port staffed by technical assistants able to
train and assist small and medium sized operators with the input and interpretation of

                                                39
information. This will require considerable learning-by-doing, not only on the part of the small
operators, but also by Veritas itself, government authorities and the large commercial enterprises.

 5.57 Implementation of the New Generation Import Verification Program, largely at the
Port, remains an ambitious undertaking as noted earlier. This reform is extremely important
in enhancing revenue collection, improving transparency and in reducing rent-seeking
opportunities. This is encountering rather significant opposition from within the Customs
administration, but the Government is remaining firm in its resolve to forge ahead in spite of the
resistance.

 5.58 Beyond the port, road and rail transport represent key bottlenecks and impose
constraints that will only become more apparent as port efficiency improves. There are
important concerns around the current level and condition of road and rail infrastructure and the
level of ongoing maintenance, but also around the institutional, regulatory and governance
structure in the transport sector. The “tour de role?, or queuing system for trucks, is informally
practiced in Benin, i.e., it is not imposed by government regulations, but is nonetheless largely
followed by trucking unions and traditional trucking consignment practices. This leads to
significant inefficiencies as it limits competition, reduces incentives to invest in better
performing trucks, provides ample opportunity for rent-seeking, and imposes needless additional
costs. Despite the fact that its removal is in the medium and longer term interests of independent
truckers, it is largely opposed by truckers’ unions whose membership is predominantly
comprised of small truckers who operate old, poorly performing trucks and would not be
competitive should the system be reformed.

 5.59 The existing rail line and related rail infrastructure has become largely
dysfunctional. Current rail infrastructure extends from the Port of Cotonou to Parakou -- about
half way from Cotonou to the border with Niger. Efforts are underway to privatize the OCBN
(Organisation Commune Benin-Niger des Chemins de fer) in order to have it play its rightful
role in transporting goods largely destined for Niger. Efforts are also underway to construct a
“dry port? at the rail termination in Parakou to facilitate the loading of trucks destined for Niger
at the rail head. The original intent, and it remains so today, is to eventually extend the rail line
to Niamey. An India-Benin joint venture has been awarded the concession to rehabilitate, own
and operate the rail line, but this has run into significant delays due to negotiations with Niger,
which jointly owns OCBN with Benin. There is significant potential in this rail line given recent
developments in Niger including the development of Niger’s uranium potential. As the
arrangement to privatize the rail operations progresses, related reforms may present themselves
and will be included as appropriate in future operations. However, these reforms remain difficult
to identify at this time and will depend to a considerable extent on the final form of the
concession extended for the railway.

 5.60 Meaningful reform in trucking beyond the port will have to be largely pursued
through regional mechanisms. The system is based on regional practices, arrangements and
agreements that involve trucking interests in other countries, largely Niger in the case of Benin,
and it is difficult to identify meaningful reforms that can be implemented unilaterally in Benin.
As such, the transport reforms supported by this operation focus on port efficiency and the
improvement of truck management at the Port of Cotonou, leaving broader reform to more
regional approaches. Near term implementation of an electronic truck traffic system in the Port

                                                 40
(a prior action for PRSG-7) should increase efficiency of load allocations, limit potential
overloading (a serious issue for road conditions) and reduce opportunities for rent seeking.
Eventual incorporation of an electronic trucking module into the Guichet Unique will further
increase efficiency, transparency in load allocations, reduce unnecessary costs and further
eliminate opportunities for rent.

5.61 Prior actions for PRSG-7 are as follows:

  i.   A contract has been entered into for implementing an electronic truck traffic management
       system in the Port of Cotonou
 ii.   The New Generation Import Verification Program, including the installation of scanners,
       based on a risk management approach has been adopted

Private Sector Enabling Environment

 5.62 The private sector enabling environment encompasses a multitude of variables,
including issues of political stability, personal and property security, macroeconomic stability,
availability of quality human capital, reliable infrastructures services, an enabling social
environment, access to financial services, a well functioning legal and judicial system, and an
administrative and institutional environment favorable to private sector development. Given this
range of variables and the need in Benin to improve on most of them, it is a difficult task to
differentiate between the critical and simply important reforms. Furthermore, rarely would one
or two reforms in and of themselves lead to significantly improved private sector performance.
This does not imply however, that attention to the private sector enabling environment should be
disregarded. Indeed, improvement in this area is vital to economic growth -- development and
poverty reduction objectives will not be met without advances on this front.

 5.63 Not only are there a multitude of interdependent reforms that must be undertaken,
but many clearly identifiable actions must be simultaneously accompanied by less easily
identifiable administrative and behavioral reforms/changes to render the actionable
reforms effective. For example, as a prior action or trigger one can merge the process of
registering a business with obtaining a tax identification number in order to eliminate one step in
creating a business, as has been done in Benin. However, if there are not simultaneous
fundamental improvements in the administrative and business procedures within the offices that
actually receive and process the applications, the time and effort required to establish a business
may not be reduced. The authorities recognize that far more than regulatory changes are
required, and have noted that great improvement can be made in improving Benin’s “Doing
Business? indicators simply by improving administrative and bureaucratic efficiencies within the
current regulatory framework. It is often less a matter of constraints in the regulatory
environment than constraints in administrative and operational culture and norms.

 5.64 Achievement of results will require more than just regulatory change, and policy
dialogue therefore will focus increasingly not only on the implementation of the specific
measures noted in this PRSG as prior actions, but on the related administrative, managerial and
institutional changes that will be required in order to translate the legal and regulatory actions
into meaningful and perceptible improvements in the business environment. Going forward,


                                                41
specific constraints facing women and their economic empowerment will also be pursued. This
will be informed by the results from the poverty assessment.

 5.65 Benin has been mired at the bottom of the Doing Business rankings for some time
and with the exception of 2011, where its ranking improved to 170 from 172 out of a total of 183
countries, Benin has been on a downward trajectory. Future PRSG operations will focus on
identifying key binding constraints and integrating necessary reforms and prior actions and
triggers. Next logical steps maybe a competition policy and a new labor code.

 5.66 The prior action for PRSG-7 will focus on the contractual and judicial environment.
In the Doing Business area of enforcing contracts Benin ranks 177 of 183, and lags behind the
sub-Saharan Africa average in all of the sub-components in this measure. It currently takes 825
days to enforce a contract and costs on average 64.7 percent of the claim. The new code on
judicial procedures establishes stricter timelines for the hearing of cases, permitted delays in
transferring cases between courts and jurisdictions, appeal limits (one month to file), response
timelines, timelines on rendering decisions, and includes other measures to streamline judicial
procedures and to facilitate the hearing of cases. The goal being to reduce the time for hearing
cases and arriving at judgment and to increase the number of cases and access to the civil and
commercial judicial system.

5.67 Prior actions for PRSG-7 are as follows:

  i.   Adopted and promulgated the code on civil, commercial and administrative judicial
       procedures to streamline the judicial process and increase the timeliness of judicial
       decisions

Agricultural Diversification and Cotton Sector Reform

 5.68 The agricultural sector accounts for about 32 percent of GDP and nearly 70 percent
of total employment in Benin. Yields of major crops, including cotton, have remained
persistently low over time. Overall agricultural growth is typically around 3 percent, which is
largely offset by the relatively high population growth (3.2 percent). Agricultural production
systems rely heavily on family labor, with limited use of improved inputs, production methods
and farm equipment. Access to financing is limited outside the cotton system. As identified in
the SCRP (2011-2015), the agricultural diversification strategy in Benin has two major
components: (i) strengthen food security by competitively producing staple food products
(cereals, roots, tubers, livestock) and import competing goods (rice and fish) for domestic and
regional markets; and (ii) increasing export diversity by increasing export volume of traditional
but low volume exports, such as cashew, and by providing targeted support to emerging high
value exports, such as pineapple.

 5.69 Cotton is Benin’s largest official export, representing 25 to 40 percent of annual
exports and contributing to the livelihoods of 50 percent of the population. Production has
fallen to well more than half the level of its recent high in 2004/05 of 417,000 tons and at
137,000 tons in 2010 is at lowest level in decades. This decline in cotton production has likely
had a large impact on small, poor farmers. However, world cotton prices have recently increased
markedly and farmers should respond with higher production if supported by further reforms.

                                               42
The return to an environment of higher global food prices could also be positive for agricultural
production. Food production responded positively during the previous food price hike – with a
notable shift from cotton into food crop production. For example, maize production increased 23
percent from 2008 to 2009 and rice 37 percent, while cotton production fell over 20 percent. The
supply response will depend to some extent on effective management of agricultural input
markets. The poverty impact of higher food prices will be more mixed, as net food producers
gain while net food consumers may be worse off.

 5.70 Governance is a key issue in understanding the under-performance of the
agricultural sector over the last decade. Although Benin has moved increasingly to a market
based agricultural system (privatization, liberalization, withdrawal of the public sector), the
benefits of allowing market forces to prevail have been limited given governance failures and a
weak regulatory framework. In the cotton sector for instance, the organizational structure is
returning to a monopolistic system, though now a private monopoly in place of a public
monopoly. Unfortunately, this results not from scale economies and high fixed costs, which
might justify the emergence of a natural monopoly, but rather it stems largely from governance
failures, including, shared interests between the ruling political elites and private actors,
corruption, informal arrangements with officials, and clientelism.

 5.71 Functioning input markets are crucial as better access to agricultural inputs will
translate into needed productivity increases. Prior to the 2008 food price crisis, most agricultural
inputs were absorbed by the cotton sector, and access to cereal inputs was severely restricted and
most passed through the cotton marketing channels. This was due to typical market failures
plaguing the rural sector in general, but also to the lack of a general policy approach and vision
for the agricultural input supply chain outside of cotton. Over the past three years, efforts have
been made to provide non-cotton inputs to farmers at subsidized rates. However, much remains
to be done to ensure farmers have regular access to non-cotton inputs and that they can access
credit and related financial services in order to purchase available inputs. There is a significant
need for a better regulatory framework and a better policy framework for the non-cotton
agricultural sector.

 5.72 The PSRSA is a significant step towards these ends and its adoption and
implementation is supported under this PRSG. The PSRSA (2011 – 2015) clearly articulates
the orientation of the Government and various stakeholders’ interventions in support of the
agricultural sector in Benin. The strategy’s backbone is the promotion of value chains through
agricultural entrepreneurship and professionalization of small-scale farmers. The PSRSA is
structured around four programs (agriculture, livestock, fisheries, and administration and
management of the sector) and eight strategic areas aiming to ensure: (i) availability and access
to quality seed; (ii) access to improved inputs; (iii) access to adapted mechanization; (iv) access
to adequate finance (credit and insurance mechanism); (v) access to professional knowledge and
innovations; (vi) provision of infrastructure and agricultural facilities; (vii) access to land; and
(viii) access to markets. It is supported by an investment plan valued at CFAF 1,809 billion over
a period of five years. While the PSRSA reflects the current orientation of the Government and
sector stakeholders in support to agricultural revitalization in Benin, the strategy has taken an
inordinate amount of time to be officially endorsed by the Government through adoption by the
Council of Ministers. The recent elections and changes in ministers, including at the Ministry of


                                                43
Agriculture and the Ministry of Development further delayed its adoption. The Council of
Ministers adopted the strategy on October 12, 2011.

 5.73 Future PRSG operations will follow through on implementation of PSRSA measures
to ensure effective implementation of the strategy. Key measures included in the PSRSA will
be targeted as prior actions and triggers going forward.

5.74 Prior actions for PRSG-7 are as follows:

    i.    Adoption by the Council of Ministers of the Strategic Program for Reform of the
          Agriculture Sector (PSRSA)

                           6.    OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A        POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

 6.1 The proposed PRSG-7 is expected to have a significant positive direct impact on
poverty reduction. The strengthening of ·public sector management is expected to enhance the
efficiency and effectiveness of public resources not only in the direct pursuit of increasing
economic performance and economic diversification, but also in the delivery of social services.
It should be noted that equitable development is an explicit objective of the SCRP (2011-2015),
and the PRSG-7 supports it through improving public sector management including components
emphasizing access to basic services at the decentralized level. Components are clearly aimed at
improving access and quality of services delivered to the poor through improved performance of
relevant ministries, improved efficiency of resource utilization and improved priority
expenditure identification and tracking.

 6.2 Components are also included to improve private sector competitiveness and
agricultural productivity, thus helping to promote investment and growth in the rural economy.
The Government's 2006 annual report on the social situation (Rapport sur le Profil Social
National) emphasized the strong link between unemployment, underemployment and poverty.
Results from the poverty assessment, as they become available, will also support this strong link
between employment opportunities and poverty. Gender results and recommendations from the
poverty assessment will also help inform the policy dialogue process with the Government and to
the identification of prior actions and triggers to better incorporate gender considerations in
future operations. Thus, support for accelerating economic growth and private investment,
including through an improved business enabling environment, enhanced private sector
competitiveness and a more diversified and resilient economy would support employment
creation and poverty reduction. Reform and simplification of the customs regime are also aimed
at promoting improvement in the broader business climate.

 6.3 In addition, the program promotes better functioning of the cotton sector and
agriculture more broadly and results from the 2002, 2007 and 2010 household surveys clearly
show that households deriving income from cotton are overwhelmingly rural and poor. A 2004
PSIA analysis of planned reforms in the cotton sector in Benin (Report No. 29951-BJ) confirms
the social value of pursuing the cotton and agricultural reform agenda.

                                               44
B    ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

 6.4 The activities supported by the proposed operation are unlikely to have significant
negative environmental effects. All of the actions supported throughout the operation are
policy oriented and none support direct investments, involve civil works or involve policy
actions that would lead to significant environmental impact. This is particularly true in the area
of primary focus – public financial management, public administration and civil service reform.
Any potential environmental effects associated with the proposed PRSG would mainly be related
to the agriculture, energy and transport sectors. In these areas, support for Benin's environmental
compliance is provided by the environmental management activities associated with several IDA
investment projects in the sectors of energy, agricultural diversification, transport and forestry.

 6.5 The Ministry of Environment, Housing and Urban Development (MEHUD),
adopted a Medium-Term Strategic Plan in 2002 that defined the main environmental
objectives. The Ministry updated the environmental strategy in 2009, and revised the Medium-
Term Strategic Plan regarding the protection of natural resources. The latter was formerly dealt
with under the auspices of the Ministry of Agriculture. One of the major strategic pillars consists
of optimizing the links between environmental protection and poverty reduction through
activities addressing major threats to the environment and to people's health. This move to a
“greener? economic developmental path is reflected in the SCRP (2011-2015) and direct links
are made between environment/natural resource management and the quality of life. The SCRP
also includes improved management of natural disasters and climate change adaptation as
important areas of focus.

 6.6 Benin has an environmental impact assessment process requiring that
environmental impact assessments be carried out for all investment activities likely to have
an impact on the environment. The assessment process allows for systematic cross sectoral
coordination and planning and the process seeks an overall optimization of social, environmental
and economic interests in the establishment of mitigation plans minimizing environmental harm.
Unfortunately, the enforcement of EA regulations in the public sector is increasingly difficult
due to inadequate allocation of staff time and budget to finance EA work and environmental
mitigation plans. The sequencing of investments and the delay with which the budget
appropriations tend to be secured by spending ministries makes it difficult to complete
environmental assessments of some investments that would normally be subjected to the EA
regulations. Although environmental cells exist in many line ministries, they are not well funded
in general, and therefore lack the resources necessary to do due diligence in the area of
environmental impact assessment. At the decentralized level, environmental competence is
limited. Recently, there has been increased training at the local/commune levels on EIA
procedures.

 6.7 The ABE has overall responsibility for ensuring that strategic investment
environmental assessments are carried out for all projects in accordance with national
standards. Environmental compliance certificates and environmental management plans for
environmental impact assessments are designed by ABE, ratified by the MEHUD and then sent
to sector focal points, and ABE puts them in an online environmental database. Sector and
regional focal points send monthly reports to ABE. ABE analyzes these monthly reports and sets
up quarterly meetings with sector and regional focal points in order to organize the national

                                                45
report on environmental monitoring. Additionally, ABE involves civil society and affected
populations in environmental hearings. However, in practice these procedures suffer from
several institutional weaknesses. Of late, the capacity of the ABE as a key actor suffers from
low budgetary allocations, challenges in budget management, and lack of adequate personnel.

 6.8 Under the Bank's Country Environmental Assessment, two important studies were
completed: (i) an Institutional Analysis; and (ii) a Public Environmental Expenditures Review
(PEER). Both studies assisted the Government in better understanding environmental challenges
in order to strengthen sustainable management of the environment and natural resources. The
institutional analysis noted several accomplishments: (i) a sophisticated institutional
arrangement, with the ABE as a strong environmental player of international reputation, a
National Sustainable Development Commission that, along with the creation of small
environmental units at sectoral and local level, forms part of a sophisticated conception of cross-
sectoral coordination; (ii) a viable environmental assessment mechanism; and (iii) a
Parliamentary Commission for Sustainable Development. But there were also institutional
weaknesses to be addressed by: (i) improvement of the internal organization and functioning of
the MEHUD; (ii) better integration of the environmental function within the sector Ministries;
(iii) intensification of the environmental function in the Communes; (iv) improvement of the
efficiency and impact of environmental assessment; and (v) intensification of the partnership
between MEHUD, sector Ministries, the private sector and the civil society. The PEER
recommended: (i) improvement of the MEHUD's budget management; (ii) reinforcement of
donor coordination and aid harmonization; (iii) additional resources to be allocated to MEHUD's
recurrent budget allocations for the purpose of surveillance and control on the ground and
support to the communes; and (vi) improvement of revenue efficiency, collection and creation of
a fiscal database for forestry revenues.

 6.9 In sum, while the primary and necessary institutional structure is broadly in place
for effective environmental protection, management and assessment, it suffers from many
weaknesses common to public sector institutions in Benin. As such, strengthening public
financial management, public administration and civil service reform through this PRSG should
contribute to strengthened environmental stewardship as well.

C    IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

 6.10 The Ministry of Economy and Finance will be responsible for overall
implementation of the proposed PRSG-7. The Committee for Economic and Structural
Programs (CSPEF) in the Ministry will lead the Government's technical team with
representatives from sectoral ministries as required.

 6.11 The Government has agreed that monitoring and evaluation of the SCRP (2011-
2015), PRSG-7, and other donor budget support operations, will be based on the sectoral
performance indicators and targets set out in sector program budgets. These indicators are
consolidated in the results matrix as agreed to between the Government and donor partners
providing budget support and are closely aligned with the results matrix associated with the
SCRP (2011-2015). Sector ministries collect data and transmit it to CSPEF, who compiles the
data and produces periodic reports. This framework, which builds on the mechanism put in
place for the first PRSP, establishes a system that supports coordination of actions and synergy

                                                46
between the stakeholders involved in the monitoring and evaluation of the SCRP and the
provision of donor support. The donor community and the Government have agreed to an annual
review process which includes quarterly review meetings, as needed meetings on special themes,
a mid-year review of progress to date on the previous year’s aide-memoire, individual sectoral
reviews, and culminates in a joint donor-Government review mission and the preparation of a
new aide-memoire for the coming year. The Bank is fully involved in this process, participating
in and contributing to all facets of the process.

 6.12 While the review process is well developed, well coordinated, and involves a broad
cross-section of government actors, including senior political levels, some problems remain
to be addressed to further improve the system. One such issue is that while the overall quality
of data has improved and the various sector ministries involved do a relatively good job of
reporting results, discussions of the APR show that donors still broadly question reported results
on poverty. Sector results do not map directly to poverty outcomes and poverty measurement
and analysis received little government attention prior to 2010. Incorporation of results
emanating from the recently completed household survey (2010) as well as results from the
poverty and gender assessment currently being undertaken by the Bank should contribute to
improvement in this area. There is also a need for greater integration of results and
recommendations emanating from the review process in the budget planning and preparation
process. Adjustments in the timing of the donor review process should help in aligning the
results reporting process with budget planning. While some weaknesses remain, the functioning
and effectiveness of the existing institutional arrangements for coordination, monitoring and
evaluation have improved over previous PRSC periods following the adoption by the
Government of texts, agreements and protocols clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the
main institutions involved. Improvement in this area, in conjunction with the broader donor
community, will continue to be sought.

D    FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

 6.13 The Government's policy framework for Budget Management (GBAR) was based
on the 2005 CFAA update and the 2007 PEFA assessment. A PER was undertaken in 2010
and the authorities are in the process of integrating its findings into its policies and reforms.
Following the CFAA recommendations, PRSC-3 included as a prior action the adoption of a
decree regulating internal control, which strengthened the Financial Inspection Department and
organized the internal control framework. The positive effect of this reform was noted in the
2007 PEFA diagnostic. The Government also adopted a detailed action plan for procurement
reform based on the 1999 Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR). The plan is in line
with: (i) the WAEMU's Procurement Directives, adopted by the Council of Ministers in 2005 in
the context of the Regional Procurement Reform Program supported by IDA and other donors
(AfDB, EU); and (ii) the Baseline Indicators (BIs) developed and adopted by OECD/IDAC/WB.
The new procurement code was approved by the Council of Ministers in late 2007, by the
National Assembly in early 2009, and the passage of remaining enabling regulations to
implement and render the new Code fully effective are included as actions in this PRSG
operation.

 6.14 Progress was made in 2006-2007 on the use of exceptional budget execution
procedures, despite a setback in 2008, but this was reduced in 2009 and is well monitored by the

                                               47
Government. The remaining issues are the delay in the production of the Government’s annual
accounts by the Treasury and budget audit reports by the Chamber of Accounts. The Treasury
issue is being addressed with the recruitment of additional staff and the decentralization of the
accounting software ASTER. In February 2009, all participants in the expenditure chain,
including audits, met to agree on improvements in functioning and timeliness. A plan to catch
up on the external audit schedule has been implemented and these audits should be more to date
by 2011.

 6.15 PRSG-7 builds on the achievements under the previous PRSCs by supporting
several reforms in public financial management including planning, budgeting, procurement,
auditing and reporting. Overall, the Bank has judged implementation performance of the public
financial management reform program to date and Government's commitment to its
improvement as satisfactory. It further finds the fiduciary environment to be adequate to proceed
with the proposed operation.

 6.16 The Central Bank of the West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank
of the West African countries, including Benin, and it continues to improve its governance
structure. The latest IMF safeguards assessment was undertaken in March 2010. The updated
safeguards assessment issued by the IMF in March 2010 revealed that the institution continues to
have adequate controls in place at the operational level. However, the IMF noted that the overall
governance framework should nonetheless be strengthened by the addition of an audit committee
to ensure that the Board of Directors exercises appropriate oversight over the control structure,
including the audit mechanism and financial statements. The upcoming implementation of the
institutional reform of the West African Monetary Union (WAMU) and the BCEAO should help
improve this situation. In addition, the assessment noted that efforts to fully implement
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted internationally by other central
banks should be further pursued. In 2009, the Benin treasury account with the BCEAO that
receives and transfers budget support from donors was audited and was found to be in order.
However, a dedicated account will nonetheless be opened.

E    DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

 6.17 The proposed operation would consist of a single tranche of SDR 19 million (US$30
million equivalent) to be available upon effectiveness and disbursed on the basis of a
withdrawal application. The recipient is the Republic of Benin, represented by the Ministry of
Economy and Finance. The proposed operation would follow IDA's disbursement procedures
for development policy operations and would not be linked to specific purchases. Grant
proceeds will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation of the development policy
program.

 6.18 Once the financing becomes effective, and provided IDA is satisfied with the program
being carried out by the Recipient and with the appropriateness of the Recipient's
macroeconomic policy framework, the proceeds will be deposited by IDA into a dedicated
account at the Central Bank which forms part of the country's foreign exchange reserves. The
recipient shall ensure that upon the deposit of the grant into said account, an equivalent local
currency amount is credited in the recipient's budget management system, in a manner acceptable
to the Bank. Based on previous experience, the execution of such transaction from the Central

                                               48
Bank to the Treasury (Ministry of Economy and Finance) does not require more than four days.
The recipient will report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account
and credit in local currency to the budget management system. The equivalent amount in CFAF
reported in the budgetary system will be based on the market rate at the date of the transfer. The
recipient will promptly notify the Association by fax or email that such transfer has taken place,
and that proceeds have been credited in a manner satisfactory to· the Bank. The proceeds of the
grant will not be used to finance expenditures excluded under the Agreement. If the proceeds of
the grant are used for excluded expenditures as defined in the Financing Agreement, IDA will
require, promptly upon notice from IDA, the Recipient to refund an amount equal to the amount
of said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled.
The closing date of the operation will be June 30, 2012. The dedicated deposit accounts could be
audited on terms of reference acceptable to IDA.

F    RISKS AND MITIGATION

 6.19 Several risks could jeopardize the expected outcomes and benefits of this operation.
These include: (i) downside risks to the macroeconomic framework stemming primarily from a
vulnerability to exogenous shocks; (ii) weakening consensus for structural reforms to sustain
economic growth; and, (iii) weak implementation capacity.

 6.20 Downside risks to the macroeconomic framework remain and stem mainly from a
possible recurrence of macroeconomic slippages. Recent IMF reviews (Sept/Oct 2010,
January 2011 and July 2011) highlighted the precarious nature of Benin’s program with the
Fund. Lower than expected revenues resulted in missed performance criteria and required
significant expenditure reductions, particularly in the public investment program. While the
Government has introduced several measures to reverse this revenue under-performance and to
protect priority spending programs, risks in this regard remain significant. This is particularly
the case in light of recent resistance to the import verification program on the part of the customs
administration, which has negatively affected revenues in the latter part of 2011. On the
expenditure side, the ability to manage recent wage increases within current wage bill ceilings
remains a key risk. The Government is fully aware of the large negative implications of any
increase in the wage bill and while acceding to public sector union pressure in according wage
increases, the Government appears committed to aligning the wage bill with realized revenues.
Slippage on this front however, is possible and remains a key risk.

 6.21 Benin's economic performance remains vulnerable to external shocks. Reduced
demand in Nigeria for re-exports from Benin, primarily due to trade reform in Nigeria, and a re-
routing of re-exports to Nigeria through Niger instead of Benin explains in part the fall in
customs revenues. Furthermore, Benin remains vulnerable to fluctuations of world prices for
cotton, and to the appreciation of the Euro to which the CFAF is pegged. Other possible shocks
include terms of trade volatility and inclement weather/flooding and its affect on agricultural
production and infrastructure.

 6.22 These risks are mitigated to some extent by specific measures supported by the
proposed operation and planned investment operations in the energy sector, in the agriculture
sector, particularly efforts to diversify agricultural production, and most directly through actions
proposed in this operation to further strengthen public finance management and civil service

                                                49
reform within a sound macroeconomic framework. Also, the IMF and the Bank are working
closely together in Benin and will continue to closely monitor the Government's macroeconomic
performance. Furthermore, the overall country dialogue process among the donors, multilateral
institutions and the Government allows for some budget flexibility to address crisis-related
expenses within the context of a prudently managed budget that supports priority growth and
poverty reduction programs. The introduction of predictable and timely support through the
PRSG, and continued progress with donor coordination, will also help mitigate this risk.

 6.23 While significant resistance to reforms exists, particularly around Port reforms the
government is in a strong position to push back. With a working coalition in the National
Assembly and a new mandate the Government has a viable window of opportunity to proceed
aggressively with reforms. Nonetheless, to help mitigate this risk, IDA is supporting
engagement with stakeholders, including the National Assembly and sectoral ministries, to build
consensus around key reforms as well as leverage the dissemination of AAA and ESW work as a
means to increase knowledge on the broad advantages to be gained through structural reforms of
national importance. This leveraging of AAA and ESW will extend to communications efforts
to better disseminate findings among the general public and civil society in order to build public
support for important reforms. Such AAA and ESW work will increasingly focus on the nexus
between necessary reforms, i.e., analytical work in areas where greater reform efforts are needed
and where potential impact is greatest, and those areas where greater public support for reforms
is needed through increased awareness and improved public understanding of the reform agenda.

 6.24 Low expenditure execution reflects long term capacity and public administration
weaknesses that hinder the implementation of reforms. Examples include: (i) low salaries
and weak incentives within the public administration, which limits the capacity to retain and
recruit skilled staff in key functions such as financial management and procurement; (ii) the
complexity of the administration and the divisions in some Ministries which do not favor the
implementation of sector strategies and comprehensive reforms; and, (iii) the struggle around
politically sensitive reforms, like decentralization and public service reform, and the attendant
difficulties of implementing measures that could improve the local delivery of programs and
public services. To help mitigate this risk, many elements related to capacity building and civil
service reform have been incorporated in this operation and several complementary Bank
investment activities are helping to build institutional capacity in key areas.

 6.25 Staff's assessment is that the potential benefits of the proposed operation outweigh
the residual risks and warrant IDA's assistance in implementing the critical reforms and policy
actions supported by this operation in a coordinated fashion with other donors, while supporting
risk mitigation actions to maximize the sustainability of the reform agenda.

               59
INTRODUCTION

1. This letter of development policy describes the reform program supported by the
seventh Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-7), which is aimed at implementing
Benin’s Growth Strategy for Poverty Reduction (GSPR) adopted by the Government in
March 2011.

2. This letter outlines the actions the Government intends to complete before the
next reform program, to be submitted to the World Bank for the 2012-2014 period.
These actions, which accord priority to measures that facilitate enhancement of the
effectiveness and impact of public expenditure, will contribute to the effective
implementation of the Growth Strategy for Poverty Reduction, in particular the
improvement of public services for the poorest. They comprise the reform program
decided upon for 2011 and are divided into two key pillars: (i) public finance and
public administration management; and (ii) private sector competitiveness and
economic diversification.

3. This document focuses on the following points: (i) context and recent
developments; (ii) public finance and public administration management; and (iii)
private sector competitiveness and economic diversification.

1. Context and Recent Developments

4. At the end of the 2007-2009 Growth Strategy for Poverty Reduction (GSPR)
implementation period, the Government prepared and adopted in March 2011 a new
strategy covering the period 2011-2015. This GSPR operationalizes the Strategic
Development Guidelines. The principal actions of the GSPR are set forth in the
Priority Action Program (PAP), which is being finalized and ensures coordination
between the strategy and program budgets. The year 2010 was a gap year between
implementation of the 2007-2009 GSPR and the third generation GSPR (2011-2015),
and was characterized, on one hand, by the continued effects of the national
economic crisis and, on the other, by the effects of the floods on agricultural
production. The actions implemented followed the guidelines set forth in the 2007-
2009 GSPR.

5. The 2010 progress report on GSPR implementation was prepared and jointly
reviewed by the Government and technical and financial partners in June 2011.

6. The 2010 floods and continued effects of the crisis significantly impacted
implementation of the Growth Strategy for Poverty Reduction (GSPR). It bears noting
that these floods were the worst in 50 years. Their trail of devastation included the
loss of 46 lives, affected 55 of the 77 communes, disrupted the lives of 680,000
persons, damaged more than 55,000 homes, 455 schools, and 92 health centers, and
led to the loss 680,000 metric tons of agricultural products and 201,600 hectares of

                                         60
crops.    Flood damage to agricultural production and commercial activities in
particular was assessed at more than CFAF 127 billion.

7. Against this backdrop, the real GDP growth rate, which stood at 2.6 percent of GDP
in 2010 against 2.7 percent in 2009, remained stagnant. Public revenue collected
stood at CFAF 603 billion, compared to 681.9 billion CFAF, a decline of CFAF 78.9
billion. Despite the poor performance in the public expenditure area, a prudent
approach to macroeconomic management was maintained, which led to a budget
deficit of 3 percent of GDP compared to 7.4 percent in 2009.

8. Benin also held presidential and legislative elections in March and April 2011. These
elections resulted in the reelection of President Boni Yayi and ushered in a Parliament
supportive of the actions of the President. Over the next five years and in keeping
with the Growth Strategy for Poverty Reduction (GSPR), the Government intends to
maintain and bolster the stability of its macroeconomic framework. It also intends to
step up the pace of reforms essential to providing the flexibility needed to tackle the
host of challenges that call for accelerated growth and poverty reduction, as outlined
in the 2011-2015 GSPR adopted on March 16, 2011. The reform program planned for
2011 is divided into two areas: (i) public finance and public administration
management; and (ii) private sector competitiveness and economic diversification.

2.         Pillar 1: Public Finance and Public Administration Management

9.       The first pillar focuses on the following five areas:

          Budget planning and execution;
          Public procurement;
          Civil service reform;
          Decentralization; and
          Governance

10. In the area of budget planning and execution, the Government’s vision outlined
in the 2011-2015 GSPR is to “make results-based budget management [Gestion
Budgétaire Axée sur les Résultats GBAR] an integrated and coordinated management
tool that ensures sound performance by government departments and decisively
places public finance at the service of development and the wellbeing of citizens.?
To this end, the Government completed and submitted the new draft organic
budget law to the National Assembly, the central focus of which is results-based
management. The Government also sought to strengthen the public expenditure
chain by establishing a satellite connection between the central and
deconcentrated governments for the purpose of the transmission of budget data
(SIGFIP) as well as accounting data (ASTER).

11. Furthermore, in keeping with its stated desire for a transparent and reliable
public finance management system and following the adoption of the new code on
public procurement and the delegation of public services, the Government issued the

                                                61
implementing decrees setting forth the powers of the public procurement
regulatory body, the National Directorate for the oversight of public procurement,
and public procurement commissions, establishing public procurement thresholds,
adopting the code of ethics and moral conduct, and outlining public procurement
plans. In addition, measures were taken to ensure the uninterrupted weekly
publication of public procurement journals on the website of the Ministry of
Economy and Finance. These journals are also available in print form at the National
Directorate for Public Procurement [Direction Nationale de contrôle des Marchés
Publics] and contain information on bids submitted and decisions made by the
National Directorate for Public Procurement following the bid opening process.

12. In the area of civil service reform, the Government intends to institute a series of
reforms comprising the Comprehensive Strategy for Civil Service Reform [Stratégie
Globale de Réforme de la Fonction Publique]. These reforms will be based on a
number of studies to be completed in 2011 pertaining to:

      The status of civil service reforms and the formulation of a strategic plan to
       implement the civil service modernization process; and
      A review of the civil service remuneration system. This study, the second of
       its kind, was started in early August 2011 and is aimed at formulating a reform
       program to enhance salary equity and incentives and harmonize civil service
       bonuses and benefits.

13. The goal of these reforms is to improve civil service performance and foster a
democratic culture in government. To this end, the Government has prepared and
adopted the civil service code of values and ethics.

14. In the area of decentralization, the Government has conducted a study to
determine the appropriate level of transfers required to properly manage the
responsibilities transferred to the deconcentrated and decentralized authorities.
It entails a general report on workshops to formulate plans for the transfer of
authority and resources to the communes.          This report recommends to the
Government that a significant number of decisions be made so as to accelerate and
complete the transfer of financial resources to the communes, thus improving the
provision of basic services to the people. In keeping with this objective, the
Government has also conducted, through the General Inspectorate of Finance
[Inspection Générale des Finances IGF], an audit of the resources allocated to the 77
communes in the context of the Commune-level Development Support Fund [Fonds
d’Appui au Développement des Communes], with the aim of ensuring the effective
use of these resources.

15. Insofar as governance is concerned, the National Assembly passed the anti-
corruption law submitted by the Government. This law now serves as an important
legal tool in the context of moral conduct in public life.



                                          62
16. In addition to public finance and public administration management, the 2011
reform program also covers private sector competitiveness and economic
diversification.

3. Pillar 2: Private Sector Competitiveness and Economic Diversification

17. This second pillar focuses on the following three areas:

      Maritime transport and reform of the customs and port administration;
      Business climate; and
      Agricultural diversification.

18. With regard to maritime transport and reform of the customs and port
administration, the Government has identified commercial logistics as a growth pole
in the 2011-2015 GSPR. This requires high performing maritime transport, customs
and port administration services. For this reason, the Government has decided to
enhance the effectiveness of the reforms implemented at the Cotonou Port
(construction of a new container terminal, installation of a single window, etc.) by
establishing a truck traffic management system at the Port of Cotonou in order to
ease the truck traffic situation at the Port. The Government also pledged to
institute a new Import Verification Program. This new Import Verification Program
(IVP) is essentially aimed at boosting customs revenue, stepping up efforts to combat
customs fraud and insecurity, and streamlining procedures for the customs clearance
of merchandise.        The program includes: inspection prior to the loading of
merchandise bound for Benin; the inspection by x-ray scanners of merchandise
unloaded in Benin; the electronic monitoring of in-transit merchandise; assistance
with the automated management of customs clearance warehouses and clearance
zones, as well as export warehouses and zones and container terminals; and
certification of the weights and values of merchandise imported via the Port of
Cotonou or by land. This program was launched on April 1, 2011.

19. With regard to the business climate, the President of Benin promulgated the law
on civil, commercial, and administrative procedures, which was approved by the
National Assembly the end of February 2011 with the aim of streamlining the judicial
process and expediting the judicial decision-making process. On October 19, 2011,
the Head of State also appointed the Permanent Secretary of the Presidential
Investment Council [Conseil Présidentiel de l’Investissement CPI] and a Technical
Adviser responsible for promoting the Presidential Investment Council. The latter are
responsible for reviving the CPI and, in particular, spearheading the reforms necessary
to improve Benin’s “Doing Business? indicators.

20. Cognizant of the importance of agriculture and its growth potential, the
Government made agriculture a growth pole in its 2011-2015 Growth Strategy for
Poverty Reduction (GSPR) and adopted a Strategic Agricultural Sector Recovery Plan
[Plan Stratégique de Relance du secteur Agricole]. This agricultural policy
document makes the sector a key engine of Benin’s new economic and social

                                          63
development process. It provides for reforms targeting, inter alia, higher agricultural
productivity and production. More specifically, these reforms pertain to:

      Agricultural modernization through an appropriate mechanization process and
       water management;
      Promotion of agricultural entrepreneurial activity, diversification of the agro-
       industry, and professionalization of persons operating in this field;
      Development of the value chain approach in the promotion of the agricultural
       sectors; and
      Implementation of the agricultural product diversification strategy.


4. Mechanism for Coordination and Monitoring the Implementation and Impact of
the Program Supported by the PRSC

Coordination of the Program Supported by the PRSC

21. Similar to previous programs supported by Poverty Reduction Support Credits
(PRSCs), this program will be carried out under the supervision of the Ministry of the
Economy and Finance, through the Economic and Financial Program Monitoring Unit
[Cellule de Suivi des Programmes Economiques et Financiers CSPEF], and in close
collaboration with the sectoral ministries affected by the focus areas of the program
and with those departments working in the area of poverty reduction.

Monitoring Implementation of the Program Supported by the PRSC

22. The 2011-2015 GSPR has the advantage of closer monitoring. The Government
plans to (i) assign greater accountability to the sectoral ministries for GSPR
implementation and to the central statistical units in the various areas of focus; and
(ii) strengthen institutional coordination mechanisms so as to better harmonize its
different components. The Government is continuing to improve the functioning of
the decentralized monitoring units with the aim of enhancing (i) GSPR monitoring at
the deconcentrated and decentralized levels; (ii) the participatory process and, in so
doing, strengthen the quality of services and the effectiveness of policies and
programs; and (iii) the operations of the units responsible for the monitoring and
evaluation of GSPR implementation.

23. The reform program will be monitored by means of program budget performance
reports prepared by the sectoral ministries involved as well as annual reports on GSPR
implementation. The World Bank will also conduct joint reviews with the other
development partners. Ongoing dialogue will be held among the signatories to the
program.

24. In agreement with IDA, the Government finalized preparation of the PRSC-7
during the course of 2011. It has therefore taken all the steps necessary for
implementation of the measures and actions identified in this context.

25. The Government views these policies and measures as an important step that will
facilitate implementation of the 2012-2014 reform program with the aim of achieving
the medium-term objectives of the 2011-2015 GSPR. It is therefore requesting World
Bank assistance in the form of financial support for its Growth Strategy for Poverty
Reduction.

 IMF Executive Board Completes Second Review Under the Extended Credit Facility for Benin and Approves
                                    US$16.9 Million Disbursement
Press Release No.11/326 September 7, 2011

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the second review of
Benin’s economic performance under the program supported by the Extended credit Facility (ECF). The
approval will enable the immediate disbursement in an amount equivalent to SDR 10.61 million (US$16.9
million), bringing total disbursements under the program to an amount equivalent to SDR 31.84 million
(US$50.6 million).

In completing the review, the Executive Board granted a waiver for nonobservances of the performance
criterion on the concessionality of external debt. The three-year ECF arrangement for Benin was approved
on June 14, 2010 (see Press Release No. 10/243) in an amount equivalent to SDR 74.28 million (about
US$118 million).

Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Benin, Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy Managing Director and Acting
Chair, issued the following statement:

“After overcoming setbacks and a natural catastrophe in 2010, economic recovery is expected to accelerate
in 2011. Growth is expected to strengthen to close to 4 percent, led by a resumption of investment and post-
flood reconstruction, a rebound in agriculture, and growth in the region. Inflation is projected to remain
subdued.

“Program implementation has been broadly satisfactory during the second program review period. All end-
March 2011 quantitative targets were met, with the exception of the floor on priority social spending, which
was missed amid restraint in expenditure execution. The implementation of the structural reforms has been
mixed. Since March, the continuous performance criterion on nonconcessional external debt has been
missed. The authorities are taking measures to strengthen performance in these areas.

“A prudent fiscal policy remains essential to preserve macroeconomic stability. Enhancing revenue
mobilization in the second half of the year will be critical for generating fiscal space for priority spending.
Strengthening public financial management and mobilizing external concessional assistance remain key to
consolidate recent gains in debt sustainability and strengthen resilience to shocks.

“The authorities are committed to keeping the wage bill within the program envelope in 2011. This policy
would be conducted within the framework of a comprehensive civil service reform.

“Important structural reforms will be introduced in the remainder of 2011 and 2012. The envisaged new
reforms would reinforce the program by expanding the tax base and encouraging tax compliance, and
improving the efficiency of public enterprises,? Mr. Zhu added.
