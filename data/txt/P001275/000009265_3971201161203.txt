1. Introduction
This Environmental Assessment (EA) report has been prepared on behalf of Kenya Power
Company (KPC) by Sinclair Knight and Partners Pty Ltd in association with RPS
International Ltd (Kenya) and ESA Pty Ltd (Sydney).
KPC propose to develop a 64 MWe power station comprising two 32 MWe units, to
extract geothermal energy available in the North East Olkaria geothermal area located
approximately 80 km NW of Nairobi. At present KPC operate a 45 MWe power station at
East Olkaria approximately 3 km SSE of the proposed power station site.
The EA has been conducted following World Bank guidelines for the preparation of EAs.
It provides the following information:
o     a description of the local setting, the geothermal resource and the history
of the development (Section 2);
o     a brief review of the requirements for power in Kenya and a justification of
the need for the project (Section 3);
o     a review of the regulatory and legal requirements that the project will be
affected by under Kenyan law (Section 4);
o     a description of the major elements of the development (Section 5);
o     a description of the existing environment under the categories, flora, soils,
fauna, ciimate and meteorology, air quality, noise, water quality and water
management and socio-economics (Section 6);
o     an assessment of impacts for each element of the environment and the
recommendations for mitigating measures to ensure that impacts are
maintained at an acceptable level (Section 7), and;
o     a summary of the major conclusions reached in the impact assessment
section and the recommended mitigating measures and monitoring that
should be undertaken (Section 8).
The major environmental issues that have been identified for the project are the way in
which the project will interact with the Hell's Gate National Park, which encloses both
power stations, the potential for adverse effects due to air emissions on the neighbouring
flower farms located adjacent to the proposed power station, the interaction of the power
station with Lake Naivasha, and the impact that the power station work force will have
on the community infrastructure in the Naivasha area. It is concluded that all these
matters can be satisfactorily managed by the project.

2. Local Setting  and  History  of the
Development Project
2.1 PREAMBLE
This section presents background information on the North East Olkaria Project.
Included is a description of the project in a national and regional setting, a brief review
of the history of the project and a review of the regional and local geology. It also
presents a useful introduction to Section 5, which provides further background
information on the geothermal resource and the infrastructure required to extract
geothermal energy and generate electricity. The information is presented in the form of
a review of existing sources of information, such as earlier geological studies and the
feasibility report for the development. The section does not present original research or
new interpretation of data and the reader seeking more details on these aspects should
consult the literature cited in the various discussions. The reader should also be aware
that this section introduces information that is discussed and analysed in much more
detail elsewhere in the report.
2.2 LOCATION AND LOCAL SETTING
The location of the project area in a national setting is shown on Figure 2.2.1. Figure
2.2.2 shows the project area in a regional setting.
The Olkariia geothermal resource is located on the southern side of Lake Naivasha. The
resource presently supports an existing power station, which commenced construction
in 1980. Stage 1, 15 Mwe, was commissioned in 1981, Stage 2, a further 15 MWe,
was comrnissioned in 1982 and the final 15 MWe expansion was commissioned in
1985. Thus the present development stands at 45 MWe. The existing power station
provides useful information for determining the effect that the proposed geothermal
power station development will have on the environment. The environmental studies
presented in this EA make extensive use of this information, thereby improving the
level of confidence in the assessment of environmental effects that will result from the
proposed development.
The presence of the existing power station also has consequences for cumulative
effects, particularly for air pollution and socio-economics.
An important factor in the environmental studies has been the existence of the Hell's
Gate Naticinal Park, which was established on 2 February 1 984, several years after the
present Olkaria power station was commissioned. The park encloses both the existing
power station and the site for the proposed power station and much of the geothermal
resource. This imposes constraints on the way in which the park and the power
stations need to be managed. These matters are considered in Section 7, which
discusses the interaction that is taking place between KPC and Kenya Wildlife Service
(KWS) to ensure that conflicts do not arise.
Another important factor in the environmental studies is the question of Lake Naivasha,
the southern shoreline of which is located approximately five kilometres from the site of

the proposed power station.  The lake, along with the geothermal resource are
arguably, from an economic point of view, the two most important physical resources
in the area. KPC at present makes use of lake water for make-up cooling water for the
existing power station, for "domestic" purposes and for exploration and development
drilling. KPC does not need to rely on the lake for the operation of the power station,
nor for the exploration program. However, the use of lake water is presently the most
economical method of providing water for the existing power station and for the
expansion programs and thus KPC is a user of lake water (see further discussion on
lake water usage in Section 6.)
Plates 1 to 12  are presented to assist the reader in appreciating the general
surroundings including the terrain, the vegetation and the physical appearance of the
existing power station, the well-field, the transmission lines and so on.
Plate 1 is a distant view towards the project area from the Trans Africa Highway on the
lower part of its descent on Kikuyu Escarpment of the Rift Valley travelling towards
Naivasha. The approximate viewing point and direction of viewing are shown in Figure
2.2.2. The plate shows the southern portion of Lake Naivasha (1), part of the Ol
Njorowa Gorge (2) and Olkaria Hill (3) as they appear from this distant viewing point.
Occasionally (not in this view) small plumes of condensing water vapour from the
existing power station cooling towers, or gas ejectors, or wells under test, are visible
as a very minor feature of the landscape viewed from this point. Generally these would
not be noticed from the road. The existing power station is approximately 25 km
southwest of this viewing point and is not visible because it lies behind some hills. Its
approximate location is marked 14) on the plate. The proposed power station will also
be obscured from view at this point.
Plate 2 shows the existing 45 MWe power station as viewed from the high ground
approximately 1.5 km to the northwest (see Figure 2.2.3). Some of the cliffs of Ol
Njorowa Gorge are visible in the background. This view is typical of dry, daytime
conditions. No vapour plumes are visible under these conditions. Generally, in the
early morning, or during days when the humidity is high, cloud-like plumes of
condensing water vapour are visible from the cooling towers, the gas ejectors on the
main power station building and from the separators at each well.
Plate 3 shows the site of the proposed power station viewed from approximately 500
m to the west-northwest of the existing power station cooling towers (see Figure
2.2.3). The photograph was taken under damp (humid conditions) and shows large
plumes of condensing water vapour from the cooling towers ((1) on the left of the
photograph) and from the gas ejectors ((2) in the centre). The peak of Mount Longonot
(3) is visible in the background to the right. An interesting observation that can be
made from the photograph is the much greater plume rise that the cooling tower plume
undergoes compared with the plume from the gas ejectors. The proposed power
station design provides for non-condensable gases (including hydrogen sulphide) to be
emitted from the cooling towers. This should provide significantly better dispersal of
the hydrogen sulphide emission than is the case with the existing disposal method.
The existing disposal method through high-velocity gas ejectors on the eastern side of
the main power station building allows the gas ejector plume to be grounded
prematurely as the gas ejector plume is frequently trapped within the turbulent building-
wake as the air flows across the building. The plate shows this occurring to the lower
portion of the plume.

photograph was taken with a telephoto lens and the zebra shown in the plate would be
approximately 200 m from tie well. The zebra will sometimes walk and stand on the
well pad of wells uncer test.

X2-Camp (2). the sealed power station access road (31, the (KWS) Olkaria Gate

same viewing point but taken witn a longer fccal length setting to show the more
distant features more cleariy. The same key acplies to this plate as to Plate 6. The
leafless state of the busnes ir ;ne rorecrcu nd is due to an extensive fire, which burnt
much of the vegetaticn in the area n eariy 1991.
Plate 8 shows a view from tne east across the proposed power station well-field. It
shows tanks used to store and feed Lake Naivasha water for drilling work required for
well development (1). several drill pads (2! and Olkaria Hill in the background.
Plate 9 shows typical well-head infrastructure as used on the existing power station. It
shows the separators (1) and associated high-pressure piping to take the steam from
the well to the power station. The well-head is fenced with a cyclone wire fence which
is just apparent in the photograph. The photograph also shows the appearance of the
transmission line pylons (2). These are generally only "noticeable" when the viewing
point highlights them against the horizon. The proposed power station will use two
centrally located separators. Individual separators will not be required at each well-
head.  Piping will be  coloured to blend better with the natural vegetation and the
plumes of condensing water vapour will not be visible. Cyclone-wire mesh fencing will
still be used.
Plate 10 shows a drill pad and drilling rig with Olkaria Hill in the background. The size
of the pad is determined by the requirement for space to store equipment and to work
during the drilling work. The completed well-head requires very much less space.
Plate 11 shows a view from high ground to the north of the power station looking
south (see Figure 2.2.3). The existing power station is off the photograph to the right
of the viewing point. Points of interest are Central Tower (11) which is on the southern
boundary of Hell's Gate National Park, the 01 Njorowa Gorge 12) and Suswa Volcano

2.3 GEOLOGY OF THE AREA
This description of the geology of the area has been prepared, for the most part, from a
report prepared for the Ministry of Energy (Kenya) by Clarke et al. (1990), from a paper
by Ogoso-Odongo (1986) and from discussion with KPC geothermal scientists. The
purpose of the description is to provide background information on the geological
features of the area. It does not present original research or new interpretation of data.
Figure 2.3.1 (from Clarke et al., 1990) summarises the major surface features of the
area and relates them to their geological origins. The rocks and structures throughout
the area have been created within the past four million years. Table 2.3.1 (derived
from information presented in Clarke et al. (1990)) summarises the episodes that
resulted in the creation, of the major features.
The Olkaria Volcanic Complex (see Figure 2.3.1) is a multicentred volcanic field
comprising at least 80 small centres covering an area of approximately 240 km2. This
may be contrasted with the Longonot Volcano, which has a single large distinct
volcanic centre. The composition of the surface rocks in the Olkaria Complex is
comendite, or peralkaline rhyolite. Most of the surface features comprise steep sided
domes formed from lava and/or pyroctastic rock, or thick lava flows. Figure 2.3.2
shows the locations of the major domes and lava flows. In some cases the domes
have coalesced and present themselves on the surface as arc-like ridges, or large hills
rather than discrete domes (see 01 Orugo Hills and hills in the Gorge Farm area in Figure
2.3.2). The domes enclose an approximately circular depression which is obscured in
part by the presence of the Ololbutot ridge (formed approximately 130 to 230 years
ago) and the Gorge Farm hills. The enclosed depression has been cut by the 01
Njorowa Gorge which was formed by outflowing water from Lake Naivasha (see Figure
2.3.2). The existing geothermal power station is located in the approximate centre of
the depression. (see Figure 2.3.2)
Details of the subsurface geology are known from over 30 geothermal wells, ranging in
depth frcim 1000 to 2500 m. These show that subsurface rocks comprise at least
2600 m of subaerially erupted rhyolitic, trachytic and basaltic lava, and associated
pyroclastic rocks.
The period of formation of the complex is estimated from samples taken at a depth of
1000 m near Olkaria Hill to be 0.45 million years.  The younger Olkaria events are
estimated to be 91 50 + 110 years old, events that gave rise to the ring domes are
estimatecl to be 3280 + 1 20 years old and, as noted earlier, the Olubutot lava flow is
estimated to be 180 +50 years old (Clarke et al., 1990).

2.4 THE GEOTHERMAL RESOURCE
The Olkaria geothermal field has been under investigation for approximately thirty
years. Two wells drilled in 1956 encountered hot conditions which established the
presence of a potential resource.
The geothermal energy is extracted by drilling into the steam zone and transporting the
steam, water and non condensable gases, by high pressure pipeline to the power
station turbines. This section briefly reviews information that is known about the
steamfield. This is described in Section 5 of the feasibility study (Ewbank Preece
Limited, 1989). It is also considered in some detail by Clarke et al. (1990). Material
presented below draws on these two reports.
The geothermal field is associated with the Olkaria Volcanic Centre.  From  the
arrangement of fumaroles and other geological information it is inferred that the field
occupies an approximately circular area of 50 to 80 km2. The northeast sector which
is the resource that would be exploited by the North East Olkaria Power Station,
occupies an area of approximately 1 2 km2, within which a production field occupying 5
km2 would be developed. It is expected that a further 3 to 4 km2 could be added to
the production area following further study. The total area would then be 8 to 9 km2.
The distribution of wells is shown in Figure 2.4.1, which also shows the area of the
field. Over the 30 year life of the power station there will be approximately 55 wells,
30 to the east of the road and 25 to the west. These are referred to as the east and
west sectors respectively. The wells will be spaced at approximately 325 m giving an
average density of approximately eleven wells per square kilometre, each producing on
average 3.25 MWe initially. Thus for a 64 MWe power station approximately twenty
wells will be required, ten in each sector.  In practice each sector will require
approximately 14 wells and during the 30 year life of the project approximately seven
to ten replacement wells will be required (per sector).

3. Need for the Project
3.1 KENYA POWER REQUIREMENTS
The feasibility study forecasts the peak demand and annual power requirements to 2006,
using the Acres International National Power Development Plan prepared in 1985. The
Acres Plan forecasts have been updated by commencing the base year using actual figures
for peak demand and electrical energy consumption for 1987. Assuming growth rates
which correspond to the Acres higher growth rates forecasts to 1 990, the median growth
rate forecasts to 2006. have been used. Selection of the higher growth rate estimates to
1990 is justified by the fact that the first two years of the Acres' forecasts were 2.1%
lower than the actual growth rate. However, it was considered that in the longer term the
median growth forecasts were likely to be the more accurate. Table 3.1.1 summarises the
forecast demand for electrical energy and the peak demand.

The apparent anomaly whereby the power generation system can meet the projected peak
load in 1991/92 and 1992193 but not the projected annual energy requirement arises
because the peak load figures take no account of equipment availability, which is affected
by breakdowns and scheduled maintenance.
If no new generating capacity is developed, the feasibility study analysis identifies a
significant capacity shortfall in the early 1 990s, of 33 GWh in 1 992193, assuming average
rainfall in the hydro-electric power generating areas. The shortfall is estimated to increase
to 216 GWh in 1994/95. This indicates an urgent requirement for additional generating
capacity.
3.2 KENYAN GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES
Kenya has a number of geothermal areas, which have been identified as a result of joint
Kenyan Government and United Nations Development Program (UNDP) scientific surveys.
The major prospects are at Olkaria, Eburru and Bogoria. As a result of a 1972 review, the
Olkaria prospect was given top priority and this has led to the development of the existing
45 MWe power station at Olkaria. Further drilling and well testing in the North East
Olkaria field (north of the existing power station) have demonstrated the existence of a
steamfield capable of supporting a 60 MWe power station for a period of at least 30 years.
None of the other geothermal prospects have been drilled and tested to the same extent
as the North East Olkaria prospect.
3.3 DISCUSSION OF ALTERNATIVES
Kenya's power needs and methods of meeting these needs are discussed at length in the
Acres (1987) national power development plan and the feasibility study (Ewbank Preece
3-2



Limited 1989). Some apsects of these reviews have been discussed above.
There are of course alternative approaches to meeting the demand for power identified in
Table 3.1.2 and these are discussed in the feasibility report (Ewbank Preece Limited 1989)
and the national power development plan (Acres 1987).
Alternatives are to leave the demand for power unmet, to import the power (from Uganda),
to meet the requirements by the development of hydro projects, or to develop coal-fired,
oil-fired or gas turbine power plants. Apparent alternatives, such as wind and solar power,
cannot presently be considered as practical alternatives in meeting energy requirements
of this magnitude. A final approach is to meet the demand by energy conservation or
demand rnanagement. Energy conservation could produce some savings, but these would
not signiificantly affect the overall conclusions of the Acres (1987) or Ewbank Preece
Limited's (1989) reports. Demand management is simply a method of not meeting
demand (for example by shedding load from prioritised "non-essential" loads at times of
high power demand). Since unmet demand in Kenya is valued at 79.4 USc/kWh (Ewbank
Preece Limited 1989). This is substantially higher than the cost of providing the power.
A no-development option would seriously affect the growth in GDP.
Thus the analysis to justify the development of the North East Olkaria resource needs to
show that the North East Olkaria project is a logical step in meeting the growth in Kenya's
power requirements at this period in the development of the generation network. To do
this it is necessary to note that for efficient utilisation of a geothermal field it is necessary
to operate the power plant at a continuous steady load (that is as a base load power
plant), when this is able to be done then geothermal power is the lowest cost option by
a substantial margin. The requirement for this base load generation capacity in the Kenyan
requirements for power has been established. It is this component of the demand that the
North East Olkaria project is seeking to meet.
Agreemernts are in place with Uganda to import 30 MW continuous power from the Owen
Falls hydropower plant. However, for base case studies this import has not been
considered as firm or dependable capacity.
Alternatives for base load generation capacity have been reviewed by Ewbank Preece
Limited (1 989). They review the relative costs of various base-load plant options and
conclude the following:
1.    Gas-turbines are not economic for base load operation.
2.    Coal-fired plants are more economical than oil-fired plants for base load
generation.
3.    The geothermal option is more economical than coal-fired generation at load
factors above 60 to 65 per cent.
4.    For higher load factors geothermal plant is by far the most economical
option.
It will still be necessary to develop gas or oil-fired power plants to meet peaking loads
particularly in dry years when power generation by hydro plants will be reduced.
3-3



Undeveloped hydroelectric resources in Kenya total over 1400 MW of capacity and 6000
GWh/y of average energy. The most promising hydroelectric project is the Miriu project
on the Sondu River with a unit cost of average energy of $US 0.030/kWh. The remaining
projects all have estimated unit cost in the range $US 0.050 and $US 0.058/kWh. The
Miriu project is recommended for development in 1997/98. These can be compared with
the cost of $US 0.039/kWh for a 2 x 32 MW power plant at North East Olkaria generating
472 GWh (that is 84 per cent plant load factor). This cost reduces with increasing plant
load factor. From the above it is clear that geothermal power will be an important
component in any plan to meet increasing power demand in Kenya, in particular the base-
load component of this demand.
A least-cost generation expansion plan has been developed in the Acres (1987) report.
The recommended generation plan is summarised in Table 3.3-1.
The table shows that 2 by 32 MW North East Olkaria units should be on line by mid-1 994.
Given the present position on the urgent requirements for additional generation capacity
and accepting that the requirement for power should be met, the only practical alternative
is a thermal station. Geothermal power is significantly cheaper than either coal-fired or
fuel-oil-fired stations and does not involve importation of the source of energy. Thus
geothermal power is the preferred option and of these the North East Olkaria field is the
only field proven at this stage to be capable of supplying sufficient capacity and energy
to satisfy the projected demand.

4. Conduct of the Environmental
Assessment and Regulatory and
Legal  Requirements  Affecting
Geothermal Development
4.1 HISTORY OF LAND TENURE
The project is located on Public Land in the Naivasha Division of the Nakuru District of the
Rift Valley Province. The land on which the proposed power station is to be built is public
land which was gazetted as a National Park on 2 February 1 984. KPC have operated the
existing C)lkaria Power station and exploration and development work for future power
station developments since 1 9 81.
4.2 WORLD BANK REQUIREMENTS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF REQUIREMENTS
4.2.1 Requirements
The requirements of the World Bank for EAs are outlined in Operational Directive 4.00,
Annex A: Environmental Assessment, September, 1989. Annex A outlines Bank policy and
nprocedures regarding EAs, and related types of environmental analysis, of Bank
investment lending operations. OD 4.00 was replaced in October 1991 by OD 4.01.
however this was after the commencement of the EA study.
The purpose of an EA is to ensure that the development options under consideration are
environmentally sound and sustainable; and that any environmental consequences are
recognised early in the project and taken into account in project design.
Several kinds of environment analyses and reports are required by the Bank, depending
upon the nature of the project. Project specific EAs are used to analyse investment
projects, the detail and sophistication of the analysis being commensurate with the
expected iimpacts. The proposed geothermal development has apparently been classified
by Bank environmental screening as "Category A", because the project may have 'diverse
and significant environmental impacts'. A Category A classification requires a complete
EA, which would normally cover:
o     Existing environmental baseline conditions;
o     Potential environmental impacts, both direct and indirect;
o     Systematic environmental comparison of alternatives:
o     Preventive, mitigating and compensating measures, generally in the form of
an action plan;
o     Environmental management and training: and
4-1



o     Monitoring.
As environmental issues generally involve national, regional and local government
agencies, and cover a broad range of responsibilities, coordination of EA activities with all
interested groups is regarded by the World Bank as crucial. The Bank suggests that this
is best achieved through inter-agency meetings at key points in the EA process.
The Bank also expects the borrower to take the views of affected government groups and
local non-governmental organisations into account in project design and implementation,
and in particular in the preparation of EAs. This is important in order to understand both
the nature and extent of any social or environmental impact, and the acceptability of
proposed mitigation measures.
The Bank believes that a successful EA will also foster a strengthening of the
environmental capability and understanding in the agencies concerned. Projects with major
potential impacts normally require the establishment or strengthening of in-house
environmental groups, both on-site and in the implementing agency or Ministry.
Involvement of these units throughout the EA process:
o     Ensures that the agency's/Ministry's knowledge and perspective are taken
into account in the EA;
o     Provides on-job training for the staff, and;
o     Provides continuity for the implementation of the EA's recommendations.
The Bank's requirements as outlined above are being implemented within this EA through
the scope of work, the establishment of a Study Review Committee, and liaison with
government and non-government organisations. These are outlined in the following
sections. The establishment of a staff training program is also discussed.
4.2.2 Implementation of Requirements
Meetings
During the inception phase of this project, contact was established with relevant
government and non-government organisations. Letters of introduction were provided by
KPC, and most authorities were visited by the Project Manager. In all cases the scope and
duration of the project were outlined, and where relevant, available information was
sought. The relevant authorities contacted were:
o     National Environment Secretariat, Ministry of Environment and Natural
Resources:
o     Forestry Department, Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources;
o     Kenya Wildlife Service;
o     Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife;
o     National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation;
4-2



o     Ministry of Water Development in Nairobi, Naivasha and Nakuru;
o     Nakuru District Administration;
o     Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Planning;
o     Fisheries Department, Ministry of Regional Development;
o     Permanent Presidential Commission on Soil Conservation and Afforestation;
o     Ministry of Energy;
o     Ministry of Agriculture;
o     Ministry of Health;
o     Ministry of Labour, and;
o     Kenya Energy Non-Government Organisations (KENGO).
Review Committee
A Review Committee was established, to oversee the study and to provide input into the
study process and conclusions. The committee comprised permanent and part-time
members. The permanent members were:
o     Kenya Power Company (Chair);
o     National Environment Secretariat;
o     Nakuru District Administration (District Officer, Environment);
3     Kenya Wildlife Service;
o     Ministry of Water Development, and;
o     KENGO.
The permanent members of the committee had their initial meeting on November 13, at
Electricity House, Nairobi. The development project and the scope of the environmental
impact assessment were explained by the Consultant and discussed.
Liaison with all groups listed above was maintained during the course of the study.
4.3 REVIEW OF RELEVANT ACTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS
4.3.1 Kenya Statutory Requirements
Environmental impact assessment as a regulated process is in its early days in Kenya,
despite the adoption of the Environmental Management Policy in 1979, and the
introduction of a system of Environmental Impact Reports to cover all major governmental
4-3



and private projects. In 1 972 the National Environment Secretariat (within the Ministry of
Environment and Natural Resources) was established to coordinate environmental activities
within the country. It is responsible for the coordination and application of environmental
management policy. However, the absence of legal instruments to facilitate the
implementation of the policy means that the Environmental impact Reporting process is
not carried out effectively. Despite attempts since 1 979 to review existing legislation as
it relates to the environment, and proposed changes to provide a legal framework for the
reporting process, the appropriate statutory provisions have yet to be developed.
Environmental control of geothermal development within Kenya is therefore subject to the
requirements of both specific legislative instruments that relate to different aspects of the
environment, and to the Common Law.
In Kenya, maintenance and enhancement of the environment can and has been achieved
through both political and legislative means. In the political approach, it is the combined
effort of both Government and non-government organisations that creates a political
awareness of issues, both through the media and through dialogue between the groups.
The legal approach places an obligation, according to the existing laws of the country, on
developers to take specified actions to prevent undue effects on the environment of an
area. The political and legal control over environmental impact works interactively in
Kenya, providing some degree of compensation over weaknesses which may exist in the
environmental laws. Ministers responsible for the implementation of legislation are often
given the power to make regulations controlling certain specified actions. Development
aspects not mentioned specifically within the legislation, may be covered in regulations
under powers granted within the act.
The legislative environmental controls relevant to the proposed geothermal developments
are outlined below.
The Geothermal Resources Act
All unextracted geothermal resources are generally vested in the Government, subject to
any rights vested in other persons. The power to licence a geothermal development is
vested in the Minister administering the Act, and anyone so authorised is entitled to
undertake actions in connection with the survey and investigation of such areas. The rights
of the licensee also include the right to reclaim and utilise any water. However, land owner
rights in regard to entry, drilling and well testing exist, and the licensee is liable for
damages and injury which may result from these activities. Compensation to the land
owner or occupier is required. The licensee is also subject to conditions relating to safety
or any other conditions which are imposed by the Minister.
Any authority for exploration granted by the Minister can be revoked under certain
conditions, namely if other bores, or geothermal resources are being affected detrimentally,
or in the public interest. The Minister may make regulations under the Act, to further
safeguard environmental implications of the development activity.
The Water Act
Water is an important component in any geothermal development, and the provisions of
the Water Act apply in many ways to the development and operation of the geothermal
resource.
Water in Kenya is owned by the Government, subject to any right of the user, legally
acquired. The control and right to use water is exercised by the Minister administering the
4-4



Act, and such use can only be acquired under the provisions of the Act. The Minister is
also vested with the duty to promote investigations, conserve and properly use water
throughout Kenya.
Water permits may be acquired for a range of purposes, including the provision and
employment of water for the development of power. The permit for proposed abstraction
and storage, or other purposes, is subject to the approval of the Water Apportionment
Board. The Board may set the conditions of the permit, namely the quantity of water
granted and the time for abstraction, and may vary the conditions of the permit. The
conditions of the permit must be adhered to, and at the termination of the permit, the
Board maiy require the permit holder to remove all works erected in connection with the
licence.
Easemenits can be granted over land for the purposes of water development and
reticulation. Compensation for the use of the land, or for damages incurred due to the
operation of the works within the easement, are determined by the Water Apportionment
Board.
The construction of certain wells requires a permit and notice of intention of any well is
required, as well as data on the quantity and level of water struck.
Pollution of groundwater is required to be controlled by sealing off any contaminated water
and other methods as prescribed. Miscellaneous sections of the Act pertinent to
environmental matters deal with the striking of an aquifer in the course of mining
operations, prohibit the release of water without a permit, and specify penalties for
polluting water used for human consumption.
The Wildlife (Management and Conservation) Act
The Act deals with areas declared as National Parks, under the Act. The proposed
development area at NE Olkaria lies within Hell's Gate National Park and certain actions
and obligations exist for land users (such as KPC) within that area.
If geothermal development was defined as mining (no definition exists under this Act), the
consent of the Minister administering the Act would be required for any activities in
connecticin with that development.
The Act controls activities within the park, which may lead to the disturbance of animals.
Unauthoriised entry, residence, burning, damage to objects of scientific interest,
introduction of plants and animals and damage to structures is prohibited.
The Minister is able to make regulations as necessary for the well being of the park and
its wildlife.
The Forest Act
The Act refers to areas defined as 'Forest Areas' or 'Central Forests'. Neither the proposed
NE Olkaria development, nor the Eburru, prospect are within a gazetted Forest Area.
However, the Eburru Forest (which is a gazetted Forest Area) lies adjacent to the Eburru
prospect.
The Forest Act specifically forbids certain activities within conservation areas. These
include cutting and burning, access at certain times, building of certain types of structures
4-5



and roads, cultivation, grazing, taking of animals and the collection of honey, without
appropriate authority. Gecthermal exploration and development in a gazetted forest area
would therefore require authorisation from the Minister administering the Act.
The Act also prohibits activities such as cutting and burning on unalienated public lands
not specified as Forest Areas or Central Forests. The Minister can make regulations to
control development activities within all such areas.
The Agriculture Act
Legislative control over soil conservation and land development are mainly controlled
within this Act, and many of the provisions can be generally applied beyond those lands
suitable for agriculture.
The Minister administering the Act, after concurrence with the Central Agricultural Board
and consultation with the District Agricultural Committee, can impose land conservation
orders on lands to control cultivation, grazing and clearing. These controls may be
necessary to protect the land against soil erosion, to protect fertility, and to maintain
catchments. Local authorities are generally empowered to administer these sections of the
Act, and the District Agricultural Committee is entitled to make regulations relating to
these controls.
Agricultural (Basic Land Usage) Rules are prescribed under the Act, whereby vegetation
clearing in steep slope areas or adjacent to watercourses, without authorisation, is
controlled.
Land Acquisition Act
It is possible, under the provisions of this Act, for land to be acquired or granted access
to for the purposes of gecthermal exploration and/or development. Acquisition or access
must be shown to be in the public benefit, and compensation must be provided to the land
owners whose land is acquired or damaged.
The Factories Act
Environmental health anc safety requirements within a functioning geothermal power
facility are regulated by this Act. A power station is considered to be a factory within the
meaning of the Act, and must be registered with the Chief Inspector of Factories. The Act
requires that work areas be of an appropriate standard, well ventilated, with suitable
lighting. Sanitary areas and drinking and washing areas should be provided, and safety
provisions are described in the Act.
Of specific relevance to geothermal power plants are the requirements in this Act for the
maintenance of air quality to protect the health of employees.
The Public Roads and Roads of Access Act
The use of public roads and the rights and obligations associated with construction and
use of roads of access by geothermal exploration, construction and maintenance vehicles.
are outlined in this Act. Public roads shall be absolutely dedicated to the public. Roads of
access, however, can be provided across private land, but there exists the opportunity for
objection to the proposed road by the landowner. Once established, the road of access
must be maintained by the applicant.
4-6



The Public Health Act
This Act contains directives regarding regulation of activities that affect human health.
There exist provisions within the Act to deal, in a general way, with water, air and noise
quality as they pertain to human health. An environmental nuisance is defined, and
includes the emission from premises of waste waters, gases, smoke which could be
regarded i3s injurious to health. The owner and/or occupier of premises responsible for such
nuisances are liable to prosecution under the Act.
Chiefs' Authority Act
This Act contains little of direct relevance to geothermal development. However, it
empowers Chiefs to issue orders in relation to the following matters, which may have
some relevance to geothermal development:
o     to prevent the pollution of water in any stream, watercourse or
water-hole, and prevent the obstruction of any stream or
watercourse;
o     to regulate the cutting of timber and the wasteful destruction of
trees;
o     to prohibit any act that might cause damage to any public road or to
any work constructed or maintained for the benefit of the
community;
o     controlling grass fires, and;
o     regulating the use of artificial water supplies constructed from public
funds.
The Chiefs' Authority Act also provides for the Minister to authorise any Chief to issue
orders for work or services for the conservation of natural resources.
Local Government Act
The Local Government Act is concerned with a wide range of matters that affect the day
to day activities of individuals and organisations. To this extent the Act has provisions
that will affect geothermal development. However the sections which have the most
direct relevance are Sections 145, 146, 147 and 1 63.
o     Section 145 is concerned with the miscellaneous powers of local
authorities. Subsection (w) empowers a local authority to take
measures that may be necessary or desirable for the preservation or
protection of wildlife, and provide amenities.for the observation of
wildlife.
o     Section 146, Subsection (d) empowers a local authority, with the
consent of the Minister, to make grants for the establishment and
maintenance of game parks and other related facilities.
o     Section 147, Subsection (d) controls the cutting of timber and the
destruction of trees and shrubs.
4-7



o     Section 163, Subsection (e) empowers municipal councils, town
councils and urban councils to control or prohibit all businesses,
factories and workshops which by reason of smoke, fumes,
chemicals, gases, dust, smell, noise or vibration or other cause may
be a source of danger, discomfort or annoyance to the
neighbourhood and to prescribe the conditions subject to which
business, factories and workshops shall be carried on.
Other relevant legislation to geothermal development includes:
o     The Antiquities and Monuments Act, whereby such structures as are
known, or are unearthed by exploration, are protected, and:
o     The Lakes and Rivers Act, whereby dredging in a lake or river must
be licensed, and the licensing procedure governed by regulations.

5. D)escription   of  the  Development
F'roject
5.1 PREAMBLE
This section presents background information on the North East Olkaria Project. The
geology of the area and the geothermal resource have been described in Section 2.
The project is described in the feasibility study prepared by Ewbank Preece Limited
(1989). The study is comprehensive, but because well-drilling and testing were not
complete at the time of its preparation, it does not include details on pipeline routes,
nor does it include firm details on the proposed methods for disposal of geothermal
brine and other waste fluids, except to note that these will be re-injected.
This section summarises information from the feasibility study to provide a description
of the project for the purposes of determining its interactions with the environment. It
provides a brief overview of the way in which a geothermal power station is developed,
including a description of each phase of the project.  It then provides specific
information for the North East Olkaria Project, describing the steam gathering system,
the power generation system and other facilities including offices, fencing, workshops,
roads, sewerage and provisions for fire fighting.
5.2 THE WELLS AND STEAM GATHERING SYSTEM
5.2.1 Wells
The well-field has been drilled and to date 27 production wells have been tested. The
location of wells, including those in the East Olkaria field is shown on Figure 2.4.1.
Well depths range from 1744 m to 2497 m below the surface; that is down to 425 m
above sea-level to 341 m below sea-level. Fluid in-flow to the wells generally occurs in
three zornes, 1200 to 1500 m above sea-level, 500 to 800 m above sea-level and 45 m
below sea-level to 300 m above sea-level. The heights below the local surface will of
course depend on the elevation of the well site. Table 5.2.1 lists all wells and provides
data on the well elevation, drilled depth, inflow zones (feeder zones) and steam flow
rate expressed in kg/s and potential electrical power in MWe.
Wells in the field have been drilled vertically. Typically the drilling process involves the
preparation of a rectangular flat area of ground up to approximately 140 m by 60 m.
This area is required to accommodate the drill and associated equipment, including drill
pipes. At Olkaria all drilling has been vertical. As drilling takes place, fines from the
drill-head are flushed out with lake water, frequently mixed with detergent to assist in
collection of the fines. The detergent used must be capable of withstanding high
temperature and is usually alkyl benzene sulphonate. Bentonite drilling mud is often
used. This is essentially an inert material, but can smother plants and does not support
plant growth and in this respect is similar to a hard compacted surface. Waste water
from drilling in the North East field has in the later period of drilling been channelled by

pipe and open channel to a conditioning pond' located close to the site of the
proposeci power station. After conditioning, it is gravity fed to a re-injection well near
X2-Camp. It is understood that open channels are no longer used.
Open channels are not an acceptable method of disposing of drilling effluent or
separator water in the Olkaria environment as the flowing water often causes deep
erosion channels and under cool conditions when the relative humidity is high presents
an unsightly flow of steaming water. In addition, detergent foam is formed which also
detracts from the aesthetic values that KWS promotes as the attraction of the National
Park.
As the well is drilled it is cased with a steel liner. Typically, the first 40 m has a
diameter of 0.6 m, from 40 to 300 m the diameter is 0.44 m, from 300 m to 700 m
the diameter is 0.31 m and from 700 to 1800 m the diameter is 0.22 m. The liner is
cemented to the surrounding soil and rock using Class-A cement. The liner in the
section of the hole in which steam is encountered is slotted to allow ingress of steam
into the well. Once the well is completed, it is fitted with a valve and tested. The
surrounding cleared land around the well can then undergo final rehabilitation with the
naturally occurring grasses trees and shrubs. The area of land required around the
completed well is a square area approximately 20 m by 20 m.
5.2.2 Separator Stations
At the existing East Olkaria Power Station, steam and water are separated at the well
head. This results in a visible cloud-like white plume of condensing steam at each well.
The size of the plumes depend on the prevailing relative humidity and dispersion
conditions. Water is then either piped, or flows in concrete-lined open drains to an
infiltration point a few hundred metres to the south of the existing power station where
it is disposed of by seepage into the ground. Late changes to the design of the steam
collection system have resulted in the necessity to operate 1 5 separator stations rather
than the two originally envisaged and shown in Figure 5.2.1. This will change the
appearance of the steam field so that during cool moist weather, small white plumes of
condensirng water vapour will be visible around each separator station. Under hot dry
conditions these plumes will be very short and probably not visible. The visibility of the
plumes on cool moist days will emphasise the existence of the separator stations,
however the power station is not located in an area where the plumes would have a
significant: impact on the landscape.  Further, the natural fumaroles have a rather
similar effect on the landscape. The overall effect is expected to be similar to that from
the existing power station. It is probable that most visitors to the park will consider the
appearance of the plumes on the landscape as a point of interest rather than a negative
impact. Some will inevitably consider the plumes as a detraction from the scenic value
of the area, but this number is expected to be small because the landscape has already
been extensively modified, and visitors will not be expecting to see a pristine
wilderness area. The gorge area, which is the most scenically attractive area of the
park will not be affected.
The conditioning pond allows suspended solids to settle and the water to cool. During cooling
dissolved silica will precipitate from the water. The removal of the silica is an important part of the
conditioning process as precipitation in pipes will cause blockages.

5.2.3 Pipeline Routes and Service Roads
Pipeline routes are shown in Figure 5.2.1. Pipes will comprise a core of high pressure
steel with thermal insulation. The outside temperature of these pipes is well below the
level at which burning may occur if they are touched. The colour of the external
cladding will be brown/green to reduce visual impacts. Pipelines which cross roads,
will be encased in concrete culverts approximately 1.5 m diameter. Although the well-
field is not in an area of the park that is densely populated by animals, following advice
from the fauna consultant, several additional crossing points will be provided to allow
grazing animals greater freedom of movement within the well field to minimise the
interruption of daily migration routes.
The layout of service roads is also shown on Figure 5.2.1. All roads will be bitumen
sealed to minimise dust generation, erosion and to provide all weather access to well-
heads. In locations where slopes and soil types require, run-off will be collected in
concrete lined drains and channelled to low slope areas where water energy will be
dissipated before disposal to infiltration areas.
5.3 POWER GENERATION
5.3.1 Power Station Siting
Engineering considerations which influence the location of the power station are as
follows:
o     the requirement that it be located in proximity to the wells and at
an elevation which causes minimal loss of energy in transporting
steam and water from the wells to different altitudes;
o     the availability of a large (6-10 ha) reasonably flat area for the
power station, cooling towers, separator stations and retention
ponds; and
o     reasonable accessibility.
Environmental factors that influence site selection are:
o     the site should maintain an adequate buffer zone between
residential areas (and other sensitive areas) and the power station
so that noise and air pollution are maintained at acceptable levels
in sensitive areas;
o     the site should not affect important archaeological sites;
o     the site should not affect the habitats of rare or endangered
animal or plant species; and
o     the site should minimise the disturbance to existing land-uses, for
example the grazing of wild animals.
5-5



Two sites were considered in the feasibility study. These were selected on the basis of
engineering considerations and on the basis of a preliminary review of environmental
factors.  The sites were selected prior to the commencement of the detailed
environmental studies which are presented in this EA. The two sites are shown in
Figure 5.3.1. Site A is located on the northeast side of the bitumen road leading from
the existing power station to Naivasha. It is at an elevation of approximately 2000 m.
Site B is located 1.8 km further to the east at an elevation of approximately 2175 m.
Site B is more remote from disturbed areas and would be better suited to minimise
visual impacts and would, because of its elevation, be better suited to the dispersion of
hydrogen sulphide emissions. However, it would introduce a further disturbance into
an area of the park that is presently relatively undisturbed compared with Site A, which
is near X2-Camp (where some KPC power station workers are currently housed) and
close to the existing power station access road.
In summary, the feasibility study concluded that Sites A and B were equally suitable
and that no technical or environmental factors favoured one site over the other.
However, this present study favours Site A, because, although it will have a significant
visual impact, which will be partly ameliorated by bunding and tree planting, it will
minimise the disturbance to presently undisturbed areas of Hell's Gate National Park. In
addition, the advantage that Site B would have for the dispersion of hydrogen sulphide
would not outweigh the advantages to the Hell's Gate National Park of keeping
development to already disturbed areas.
5.3.2 Power Station
This section has been prepared from information provided in the feasibility study
(Ewbank Preece Limited, 1989).
The proposed layout of the power station is shown in Figure 5.3.2.  The main
structures include the building housing the two turbines and two 32 kWe generators,
pumps and condensers; and the two banks of three cooling towers, located on the
eastern side of the power station building. The 132 kV substation will be located on
the western side of the building. Figure 5.3.3 shows an east-west cross-sectional view
of the power station. Figure 5.3.4 is a schematic diagram showing the basic operation
of the power station. The basic process by which the power station operates is to use
high pressure steam from the well-field to drive two turbines which in turn drive two
32 MWe generators. The following sections describe various aspects of the operations
focussing on the provision of information relevant to environmental issues.
5.3.3 Handling of Waste Water by Reinjection
Steam, liquid water and geo gas are collected from the wells and piped under pressure
through pipes on the surface to two central separator stations, where the liquid water
will be separated from the steam and geo gas. Approximately 99.9 per cent removal of
the liquid water will be achieved in the separator.
From the two central separators, the waste water will flow to conditioning ponds with
a storage capacity of 3000 m3 where the water will cool to approximately 40 C. (The
conditioning process involves cooling and precipitation of some of the dissolved silica,

which has the potential to form a scale in pipe-work and wells, which will be
subsequently used to dispose of the water to the re-injection well). The ponds will be
fitted with reinforced concrete baffies to insure uniform retention time for the water
and will be lined with butyl rubber sheets (protected with paving slabs), to prevent
infiltration of water. The precipitated amorphous silica would need to be removed from
the ponds periodically. This is relatively inert and could be buried. The pond area would
be fenced to control access and to prevent animals from using the water as a regular
source of drinking water. Birds are unlikely to use the ponds as the brine would still be
too hot. However, while the water is not suitabie for drinking (largely because of it
high fluoride content), it is suggested that the ponds be made available as a
recreational resource for KPC staff and/or visitors.
After conditioning, water would be piped under gravity to a separate sump pit beside
the main road (see Figure 2.4.1) where blowdown water from the cooiing towers
would be added. Blowdown water would be taken from the cooling tower basins via a
simple level control valve at each cooling tower basin. A 10 000 m3 overflow pond,
giving approximately 12 hours holding capacity at the initial enthalpy of 1500 kJ/kg,
will be constructed for use in case of pump failure. The pond would normally be
empty and would be 100 m by 50 m by 2 m deep and lined with butyl rubber to form
an impervious seal.  The rubber would be covered with paving slabs to provide
protection from mechanical disturbance and from ultraviolet radiation. Security fencing
would also be required.
High-lift pumps and a single line would be used to transfer the waste water from the
sump to a point near OW-704 where the line would split into two separate lines which
would go to the two re-injection wells RE1 and RE2 (see Figure 2.4.1). Safety valves
would be provided on each re-injection line to protect against the re-injection wells
becoming over-pressurised.
Both liquid water from the well field and blowdown water from the cooling towers is to
be disposed of in the re-injection wells. The total volume of water that will need to be
disposed of will depend on the enthalpy of the well-field, which is estimated to initially
be 1 500 kJl/kg and is expected to rise to 2100 kJ/kg after about three years (that is as
time progresses, it is estimated that there will be less water per unit energy). The
volume of blowdown cooling water will also depend on the relative humidity as this will
affect the rate of evaporation from the cooling tower.
The feasibility study (Ewbank Preece Limited, 1989) estimates that excess blowdown
will not exceed 177 tlh and a conservative design average would be 152 t/h. In
summary the estimated amounts of water to be disposed of are as follows:
Enthalpy - kJ/kg
1 500       2100
Water from separators    698         212 (t/h)
Water from cooling tower
condensate               152         152 (t/h)
TOTAL                    850         364 (tlh)
5-1 1



Tests of OW-704 for its capacity to accept re-injection water showed an injectivity of
12.5 t/h/bar for the first 100 t and thereafter 24 tlh/bar. Well tests up to 1 lo t/h have
been undertaken. It is theoretically feasible for the well to accept 850 t/h (Ewbank
Preece Limited, 1989). It is accepted by the EA team that re-injection of excess water
is the most environmentally desirable disposal method. Further, the disposal of excess
water from the power station is a critical aspect of the design.
It is considered essential by the EA team that the feasibility of re-injection of 850 tlh
over an extended period be demonstrated before it can be considered that the project
based on the re-injection of waste water is environmentally acceptable.
5.3.4 Disposal of Geo Gas
At atmospheric pressure the total amount of geo gas is between 100 to 1 80 mmoles of
gas per kg of steam (Ewbank Preece Limited, 1989). Geo gas contains a variable
mixture of gases comprising primarily carbon dioxide (91-96 per cent by volume),
hydrogen sulphide (1.2-4.9 per cent by volume), hydrogen (0.7-3.3 per cent by volume)
with the remainder being methane and nitrogen. These gases are not condensable at
the temperatures and pressure encountered in any phase of the process and are
referred to as non-condensable gases. As the steam is used to work in driving the
turbines, its temperature falls and condensation takes place so the percentage of non-
condensable gas increases. Finally the non-condensable gas will be disposed of by
discharging it into the cooling tower fans for dispersal into the atmosphere. The toxic
fraction is hydrogen sulphide which is ultimately oxidised to sulphate and removed from
the atmosphere by dry and wet deposition processes.  The impacts of hydrogen
sulphide prior to its oxidation and removal are discussed in detail in Section 7.4.
The total geo gas emission in the cooling towers for a 32 MWe power station is
estimated to be 1.966 t/h (Ewbank Preece Limited, 1989, see also Figure 5.3-4) and
most of this is of course carbon dioxide, which apart from being a "green house" gas is
a 'harmless" component of the atmosphere, present at a concentration of
approximately 0.03 per cent.
An estimate of the "maximum" hydrogen sulphide emission rate can be made by
assuming that 4.9 per cent of the geo gas is hydrogen sulphide (molecular weight 34
kglkmole) and the remainder 95.1 per cent is carbon dioxide (molecular weight 44
kg/kmole). The average molecular weight of the geo gas will be 43.51 kg/kmole.
Therefore for a 32 MWe power station emitting 1.966 t/h of geo gas, the volume
emitted per hour at STP will be 1012.1 Nm3. Since 4.9 per cent of this would be
hydrogen sulphide the volume of hydrogen sulphide emitted per hour would be 49.595
Nm3, and the mass of hydrogen sulphide discharged per hour from a 32 MWe unit is
75.278 kg/h (or 20.911 g/s). In practice the hydrogen sulphide emission should be the
average over all wells weighted in accordance with the volume of steam provided by
each well. At this stage not all the data from all wells in the North East well-field have
been collected, but the average hydrogen sulphide concentration in the geo gas is
expected to be between 2 and 3 per cent rather than the 4.9 per cent which is the
average concentration for the most hydrogen sulphide rich well. From data presented
in the feasibility study (Ewbank Preece Limited, 1989) this is OW-701.

5.3.5 Cooling Towers
Six cooling towers will be located on the eastern side of the power station building
aligned parallel to the road and arranged in two banks of three (see Figure 5.3.2).
Figure 5.3.3 shows a cross-sectional view of the cooling tower structure. The overall
height of the towers will be 20 m above grade and they will be of the forced draft
design. The major function of the cooling towers is to provide a heat exchange system
for the turbine condensers on the low pressure side of the turbine. The cooling water
and condensed steam are then pumped to the cooling towers where the hot water is
allowed to flow/trickle over an open lattice structure losing heat by evaporation
(approximately 80 per cent) and simple heat transfer (approximately 20 per cent) to a
stream of air drawn through the tower by a fan.
Although water is lost from the towers by evaporation and from small droplets (cooling
tower drift) of water that are caught by the wind and settle out in the area surrounding
the cooling towers, there is an excess of water due to the continual addition of
condensed steam. Acid gases (mainly carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide) in the
well steam can cause the cooling system water to become acid over time. Alkaline
material will be added to the cooling (blowdown) water to maintain it in a mildly
alkaline state, (pH 8.5-9) using caustic soda, prior to being added to the separation
water for re-injection. Preliminary estimates indicate that 1 50 t per year of caustic
soda will be required to maintain the pH of recirculating water in the cooling towers at
an appropriate level and a further 4.3 t per year will be required to adjust the pH prior
to mixing with separation water.
The feasibility study foreshadows the use of biocidesfalgaecides, probably sodium
hypochlorite, which would be applied on a shock basis. With deep re-injection of
excess water there would be no environmental problems with the addition of these
materials.
The rate at which blowdown water will have to be disposed of will depend on the
enthalpy of the steam (that is the amount of heat per unit mass of steam), the level at
which the power station is operated and atmospheric conditions, which will determine
evaporative losses. The maximum rate at which water will need to be disposed of from
the cooling tower will be 76 t/h per 32 MWe unit (that is 152 t/h for the 64 MWe
power station) and the water temperature will be 45.5 'C. This will occur during
periods of high relative humidity and low steam enthalpy from the steam-field.
Typically evaporative losses from the cooling tower will be 7100.3 t/h per 32 MWe unit
(that is 14 200.6 t/h for the 64 MWe power station).  This water is primarily
condensed steam from the well-field.
5.3.6 Associated Facilities

Workshops
Workshops will be located at the southern end of the turbine house.

Administration Building
Offices and a laboratory are to be included in a separate administration building to be
located on the southern side of the power station. Car parking for up to 30 vehicles
will be provided.
Fire fighting
Fire fighting pumps will be located in a separate section of the cooling water treatment
building. Engineering details of the hydrant locations, gate stop valve and the fire-
water reticulation system are provided in the feasibility study (Ewbank Preece Limited,
1989). Approximately 27 hydrants will be provided and these will be served by a 200
mm reticulation pipe surrounding the cooling towers; the turbine, generator, main
office, stores, workshops and car park; and the switch yard. Water supply will be by
two 250 mm pipe from the lake-water tanks on the high ground (approximately 100 m
above the power station) to the east of the power station near grid reference 200 000
m E and 990 5000 m N. see Figure 5.3.1. The system will be able to supply 7500
litres per minute for four hours.
Stores
The stores building and outdoor storage area will be located at the southern end of the
switch yard, which in turn will be located on the western side of the power station
building.
Fencing
The existing East Olkaria Power Station and well-field was originally enclosed by a
cyclone wire fence approximately 2 m high. Make-up wells now exist beyond the
fence perimeter.  in addition, the East Olkaria Power Station well-heads are also
individually fenced. In contrast, the recommended practice for North East Olkaria is
that no perimeter fence should be built. Each well should still be individually fenced
and the central works plus conditioning ponds should also be fenced as a single unit.
The primary reason for this is minimise the interference to wildlife and to enable wildlife
to move more freely between individually fenced areas. This practice will reduce the
amount of habitat converted from wildlife use to electricity production. The resultant
grazing should also reduce the amount of dead organic matter which forms a fire risk.
The proposal is less expensive than the existing arrangement at East Olkaria and will
also confer environmental benefits.
Sewerage
Sewage would be treated in a septic tank system with solids being removed as required
by the Naivasha Council.
5.3.7 Power Transmission Lines
Figure 5.3.6 shows the route of existing power transmission lines (33 kV and 132 kV
lines) in the area and the route of the proposed single circuit 132 kV line between the
existing East Olkaria Power Station and the 220 kV line, which is proposed to be
constructed between the Northeast Olkaria power station and Nairobi North.

6. Existing Environment
6.1 LANDUSE SYSTEMS
The North East Olkaria geothermal field is located on the area shown in Figure 2.4.1. In
1982 the Hell's Gate National Park was gazetted. The boundaries of the park are shown
on Figure 2.4.1. It now completely encloses both the existing power station and its
associated geothermal field and the proposed power station site and the supporting
geothermal area. The extent of this can be ascertained by looking at the locations of the
700 series wells shown on Figure 2.4.1.
Thus the power station area, the geothermal field and the National Park must co-exist in
a multiple land use arrangement. The power station requires land for the physical
components of the power station, which include the turbine building, cooling towers,
offices, workshops, stores, car parking areas, roads, well pads and separators, pipelines
and drains. Land is also required as a buffer zone for safety, security and to allow
adequate area for the dispersal of odours, which while not necessarily harmful, affect the
suitability of land for certain uses.
To the north of the proposed power station site the land is used for flower cultivation,
vegetable growing, residential purposes and tourist developments. To the west and south
and east (beyond the boundaries of the Hell's Gate National Park) land is used mainly for
ranching.
The principal potential interference that the power station will have on these lands is by
means of noise pollution and air pollution. Water pollution also has the potential to affect
certain areas. However, the physical presence of the power station and the disturbance
to the land required for power station development will have local impacts. The areas
potentially affected will be discussed in Section 7. This section of the report is concerned
with describing existing conditions.
6.2 FLORA
Introduction
This section describes the existing flora of North East Olkaria area. Ecological checklists
from the area are presented in Appendix 6.2.1. The checklists used with Figure 6.2.1
show the distribution of plant species over the project area.
The Olkaria area is representative of some of the vegetation types found in arid areas of
Kenya, falling in Ecoclimatic Zone 5. This characteristic vegetation is unique irt that it
develops in volcanic soil of recent origin. The bushland- and bushed grassland is also a
characteristic vegetation type found in other areas of the Rift Valley, in some parts of
Nakuru district, Baringo district and also some parts of Laikipia district. The presence of
steam vents creates some unique features in soil and geological formations which dictate
the type of vegetation that develops in association with this phenomenon. Notably,
several species of pteridophytes and orchids which would normally be lacking in this
ecoclimatic zone are associated with the steam vents. Several are epiphytic plants on
woody plants, occurring near the steam vents, where humidity is high.Throughout the
6-1



areas in the Rift Valley that are outlets for underground steam, Fimbristylis exilis is a key
species of sedge which signifies steam presence. This plant seems to tolerate high
temperatures by forming masses of mart from dried older leaves that surround the young
growing shoots, protecting them from excessive temperature exposure. Other species
unique to this area include Ophioglossum rubellum, Dissotis seneaambiensis, Dicranooteris
linearis, Lycopodium cernuum, Pleogeltis macrocarga, all pteridophytes not normally
expected from ecozone five. Of special significance are orchid species, Cvrtorchis arcuata,
Anaraecum humile, Ansellia gioantea and Pteroolossasois ruwenzoriensis. Orchids are
unique plant species. They are highly valued by florists due to their beautiful flowers and
therefore tend to be over-exploited. Some species are threatened with extinction.
Another unique habitat of this region, which has species not normally associated with
Ecozone 5, is the gorges and luggas which are drainage areas. Species peculiar to this
region, occurring only in these localities, include Teclea simolicifolia, a tree associated with
montane forests in Kenya, Schefflera volkensii, Junigerus orocera the pencil cedar,
Dovylais abyssinica, Fiscus spp. Olea euroDaea ssp. africana - the African Olive.
All of these species are normally found in higher rainfall areas of Kenya, and under the
prevailing climatic conditions at Olkaria, the gorges and luggas exhibit a totally different
species composition uncharacteristic of this ecoclimatic zone.
The aerial photographs available were interpreted to produce a mosaic of the plant
associations of the area. About six main vegetation types emerged with well delineated
boundaries. Tarconanthus - Acacia dominated associations were found to be common,
along with various combinations of Hyvarrhernia, Diaitaria and Themeda, as well as
Cvmbooooon as the major grasses.
6.2.1 The Plant Associations
Following aerial photo interpretation, a vegetation mosaic has emerged with distinct plant
associations indicated in Figure 6.2.1. The classification is as follows:
li)    Bushland                - B
(ii)   Bushed Shrubland        - C
(iii)   Bushed Grassland       - D
(iv)   Shrubbed Grassland      - E
(v)   Grassland                - G
(vi)   Rock outcrop            - R
(vii)  Barren land             - Z
These communities tend to gradually merge into one another with boundaries either
dictated by change in topography, soil type and distinct drainage patterns and rock
structure.  Ground reconnaissance has revealed the following associations in the
vegetation communities:
(i)    Bushland (B)
Tarconanthus camohoratus - Acacia dreconolobium: This association while having these
two species as dominants in the shrub layer also has varying combinations of grass and
other herbaceous species, including Setaria sohacelata, Ersarostis cilianensis, with Chloris
gavana appearing in more open patches. Themeda triandra, a fire tolerant grass is in small

quantities in this association. The species of forbs include Commelina, Cassia mimosoides,
Teohrosia, Polvaala, Zornia agiculata with Tribulus in more open spaces. This association
is well represented in North East Olkaria where it occurs on lower slopes between open
grasslands and hill tops.
lii)   Bushed Shrubland (C)
Acacia drepanolobium - Tarconanthus camohoratus: This association is characterised by
rather shallow soil with stunted growth of these two species. A. drepanolobium tends to
dominate, with scanty undergrowth of the herbaceous layer. A clear association of shrubs
appears in clumps in the community. Patches of Setaria sohacelata appear towards the
slopey ground in this association. More open spaces are occupied by annuals such as
Aristida and Eraarostis ciiianensis along with Traous berteronianus.
(iii)   Bushed Grassland (D)
Tarconanthus camDhoratus - Acacia drepanolobiurn - Diaitaria - Cymbooooon association:
This is fairly well spread in the area covering substantial portions of the North East.
Grasses dominating the landscape include Dipitaria macrobleohara, Cvmbo ooon caesius,
Setaria sohacelata and Themeda triandra. Cvoerus appears where there are signs of
disturbance while Cvnodon occurs in pockets of locally high raised ground as 'islands'
which wildlife tend to frequent.
Setaria sohacelata is more predominant towards the sloping, more or less rocky ground
with shallower soils, whereas Dioitaria is more common in areas with deeper soils in this
association.  Chloris aavana is widely spread in this association, but tends to be
suppressed in dominance.  Herbaceous species include Striaa, Cassia mimosoides,
Cvcnium, Indicofera, Hibiscus, Salvia, Te ohrosia, HvyoesTes, Pentanisia, Monsonia
lonoes, Euohorbia inaeouilatera, among others.
(iv)   Shrub Grassland (El
Tarconanthus - Acacia - Cymbopopon - Themeda - Setaria association: This type of
association tends to be characterised by tail TaTconanthus camohoratus shrubs, sometimes
growing to tall trees. The landscape shows conspicuous Cvmbooooon caesius and
Themeda triandra as dominant grasses, with Setaria sohacelata in patches but in
significantly noticeable distribution. This type of association allows little growth of forbs,
but in patches of overgrazing, Zornia agiculata, Indiaofera, Ocimum, Achvranthes asoera,
Cleome monophylla, Heliotriogium, Chenooodium, are common, among several others.
(v)   Grassland (G)
Diaitaria abyssinica - Cvoerus - Cvnodon association: This tends to occur in low lying
areas, or depressions with impeded drainage. Dipitaria and the sedge Cyperus tend to
occur in almost equal proportions from the centre of the association towards the periphery.
Where drainage improves, Cvnodon tends to outcompete the other two and dominate. At
the edges, patches of forbs and Eraorostis appear as this association tends to merge with
the bushland, with the ecotone supporting such species as Chenooodium, Polvaala
sphenootera Soorobolus. Portulaca, Vernonia, among others. In sections where drainage
tends to be well channelised, Cvnodon predominates, with occasional Geranium, Sonchus
asoer with Solanum nigrum in more mesic sites.
(vi)   Rock Outcrops (R)
This is characterised by fairly sparse cover of shrubs of Tarconanthus and Acacia, where
some soil allows plant establishment. It tends to be confined to hill tops and towards
6-4



steep slopes. More often, Fimbristylis exilis predominates, as well as some Setaria
sohacellata, Eraprostis cilianensis, a creeping form of Cynium, Cassia, Zornia, scattered
Themecla triandra, and some Cyperus.
The steeper slopes of this association tend to contain patches of Cvmboooaon and Setaria
with Ficus, Teciea simoficifolia, Asparagus, Rhus natalensis, Maerua and Osyris at cliff
edges, _arissa, Psiadia, with Dioitaria macrobleohara in patches between the rocks where
some soil has collected. Cussonia soicata, Cordia sinensis, Euohorbia nvikae, Senecio,
Aloe, Sansevieria, are some of the main species also found in steeper sides of the rocky
terrain. Where some soil pockets appear, Chioris yavana, Themeda triandra, Heteropogon
contortus with Cvmboaon caesius tend to predominate. Silt collecting sites of this general
area support Setaria verticillata, Panicum maximum and an assortment of forbs, notably
Chenopodium  Amaranthus, Sonchus, Commelina, Crassocephalum, among others.
lvii) Barren Land (Z)
Some patches of the area where young volcanic rock has not been sufficiently weathered,
have very little or no vegetative cover. These tend to support species of Caralluma, some
Notonia, 'ortulaca oleracea, which are all succulent dry land plants with water storage and
conservation physiological adaptation mechanisms. These are harsh environments for
plant growth with extremes of temperatures and low moisture availability. Others in this
category are areas inhospitable to plant growth due to excessively high temperatures from
steam vents. A few species are however adapted to these very high temperature
conditions, notably the sedge, Fimbristvlis exilis and the red algae together with some
lichens, and ferns.
A ground reconnaissance survey over the area following the plant communities as
delineated above, produced an ecological checklist of the plants of the area. This is
organised by plant families and is presented in Appendix 6.2.1. Plates 13 to 16 (Appendix
6.2.1) show examples.
6.2.2 Vegetation Dynamics
Vegetation maps, like the one presented in this report, record the current nature of the
vegetation and indicate such features as dominant species, height of canopy, and extent
of canopy closure and areas where the vegetation has been cleared. A key factor to be
remembered about the vegetation around Olkaria is that it is not static but continuously
changing with time. The changes in abundance and composition of the species present
in the various communities will be occurring in response to stress from the environment.
Such continuous changes are referred to as succession. In the case of Olkaria the
successional changes are also likely to be interrupted by occasional wildfires (episodic
changes).
The map of the current vegetation associations is designed to act as a baseline reference
document. From this document, comments can be made about the pattern of species
associations and any anomalies as well as possible geothermal "impact" interpretation.
However, before discussing any such impacts, it is vital that the reader appreciate the
natural continuous and episodic processes (ie vegetation dynamics) so that these are not
confused as changes brought about by development activity (ie impacts).
A number of ecologists have noted that as the intensity and periodicity of stress in the
environment change, different patterns of longevity and reproduction are favoured. For
6-5



example, MacArthur and Wilson (1967) examined what attributes of a species would be
most adaptive in a near-equilibrium climax community in which competition for resources
becomes fierce, as the carrying capacity (K) is approached. They reasoned that under
such circumstances species will be favoured which have long life expectancies and low
proportions of energy devoted to reproduction, freeing energy to enhance mechanisms of
competition for resources ("K-selection").  By contrast, in nonequilibrium, early
successional habitats, species with short generation times and large reproductive effort will
be selected for, since the need to disperse and colonize over large areas rapidly is the key
to resource domination in such temporary habitats ("r-selection").
Successional changes in the predominant Acacia-Tarchonanthus communities seen at
Olkaria exemplify this trend. In the first year following a wildfire, such shrubland sites are
dominated by a profusion of annual and short-lived perennial species which produce large
numbers of seeds. Within 2-5 years, the sites are shaded by resprouting Tarchonanthus
camohoratus (Ol'leleshua) shrubs of 20-30+ year longevity which reproduce seed only
scantily; the annuals and short-lived perennials meanwhile decline in abundance drastically.
The cycle repeats at each successive fire.
On 13 February 1991, a large fire swept through the area adjacent to the existing
geothermal station and then travelled northwards into North East Olkaria area. An
extensive area was burnt. The fire resulted in much of the climax or stable state
communities, dominated by Acacia-Tarchonanthus, being destroyed and the area has now
reverted back to vegetation typical of early successional development (ie annuals and
short-lived perennials or characteristic r-type species). The fact that the area was
dominated by Acacia-Tarchonanthus dry woodland species before the fire, indicates that
fires are relatively infrequent. Even though this may be the case, fire management needs
to be considered and preventative measures taken. Vegetative mass (fuel loads) and
climate (wind, air temperature, relative humidity) are important predictors of fire hazards,
and such factors as slope help predict rate and pattern of fire spread. At temperate
latitudes, aspect also serves as a predictor because of its influence on fuel moisture. In
relation to the vegetation, the changing potential fuel load with successional changes (ie
duff build-up) needs to be taken into consideration.
The observed profusion of annuals in areas burnt by the recent fire seems to indicate that
the existing geothermal development has not affected either the process or pattern of
recolonization by pioneer species. However, the comment can only be made about the
lack of visible effects (ie acute symptoms) at this early stage. Long term monitoring is
needed to detect any chronic changes.
6.3 SOILS
Introduction
The most noticeable impact of current development on land and soils in North East Olkaria
has been erosion by water. A major part of the impact study has been an assessment of
the problem of erosion and the way in which it can be mitigated. Data on soil physical
properties have been used to explain the prevalence of erosion and the principles of its
control. A study on soil chemical properties has also been initiated to determine whether
there are any negative impacts of well testing on soil fertility.
Soil Erosion and Sediment Deposition
Investigations have concentrated on erosion by water, as erosion by wind is of minimal
6-6



importance in this area. Erosion by water involves the processes of detachment and
transport of soil. Detachment occurs in five ways. Firstly, it is caused by raindrop impact
on all exposed surfaces which have not been stabilised with murram. These include the
cut slopes and fill slopes of well pads, and other areas from which vegetation has been
removed, for example, in laying pipelines. Secondly, it is caused by runoff scour forces
wherever water concentrates in rills, gullies or unlined channels. Due to the erodible
nature of the soil, bare surfaces are very susceptible to runoff scour. Thirdly, the force
of gravity leads to slumping where cut slopes or fill slopes are too high or too steep and
where gully sides have been undermined by flowing water. Fourthly, it is caused by pore
water forces that lead to the breaching of sump ponds that has caused serious gullying in
several places. Lastly, the tractive forces of vehicles on roads and tracks which have not
been stabilised, contributes to the downward movement of soil.
Transport of sediment has taken place mainly by runoff during rainy periods but also by
waste water during well testing. For example, waste water was discharged into a nearby
valley during the testing of Well 713 and led to the formation of a large gully. As the
water ran continually for about two months, it was able to transport a considerable
amount of sediment, some of which, ended in the channel alongside the power station.
Leakage from water pipes has also been responsibie for eroding and transporting soil.
Forms of IErosion
The forms of erosion which can be observed at Olkaria are rill, inter-rill, gully and
streambank erosion. Rills are common on all cut slopes and fill slopes which have not
been stabilised with grass. Inter-rill erosion is that which takes places between rills. It is
less easily detected but is indicated by exposed plant roots and by fragments of pumice
or rock perched on pedestals of soil. Gully erosion is noticeable close to Wells 706, 707,
712, 709, 71 1, 713. Streambank erosion occurs in some of the concave bends of the
normally ciry watercourses that lead to the existing power station.
Erosion by mass movement can be observed in a few places where slumping and sliding
of cut slopes, gully sides or head scarps has occurred. Erosion in one place leads to
deposition wherever there is a reduction in veiocity or volume of sediment laden runoff.
This may be caused by a decrease in gradient on a hilislope or in a channel. It may also
be caused by the widening of a channel or resistance to flow created by a denser,
vegetative cover on the ground, for example, by star grass which is common in valley
bottoms (Plate 17). Reduction of volume by seepage into the ground, also reduces the
transport capacity of runoff. As there are no permanent rivers or streams, eroded material
does not usually move far from the place of origin.
6.3.1 Natural Erosion Hazard in North East Olkaria
The natural erosion hazard in North East Olkaria is high due to the nature of the soil and
the sloping terrain. The soils have been formed from quaternary to recent volcanic
eruptions cduring which lava flows have been overlaid by airborne ash, pumice and dust,
often in well defined layers. These layers are poorly consolidated although there has been
some redistribution of the original material under the action of rainfall and runoff. Little
weathering has taken place due to the relatively recent origin and semi-arid climate. Figure
6.3.1 shows the detailed map of soil erosion hazard.
The texture of the soil is that of a sandy loam or loamy sand. The soils are non-cohesive.

Clay content is around 5 per cent, silt is in the region of 1 5 - 30 per cent and sand around
65 - 80 per cent. Details of two separate soil analyses carried out in the Department of
Civil Engineering and the Department of Soil Science of the University of Nairobi, are
shown in Appendix 6.3.1. In many places the soils are uo to 7 m or 8 m in depth and if
the surface cover is removed, concentrated runoff easily cuts through the upper horizons
until it reaches the underlying lava, creating spectacular gullies in the process.
Water which enters the soil profile can percolate rapidly but the high content of silt and
fine sand (about 50 per cent in total) leads to surface sealing under raindrop impact.
Provided there is a vegetative cover, the surface is kept open and rain can infiltrate but,
once the cover is removed, sealing takes place and runoff rates are high. In an experiment
with simulated rainfall on a similar soil near Longonot (Barber and Thomas, 1981), a storm
of 40 mm in one hour, on a bare plot of 1 .5 square metres, led to 30 per cent runoff when
the soil was dry and 70 per cent when it was wet. The erodibility of the above soil was
found to be ten times greater than the erodibility of the red soils at Kabete, Nairobi.
Where land is undisturbed, the generally good ground cover encourages infiltration of
rainwater, and the porous nature of the underlying strata allows rapid percolation. Soil
erosion becomes a serious problem only when the ground cover is removed, or runoff
patterns disturbed, as a result of development activities and fire.
Although the erosion hazard is mainly due to the nature of the soil, it is aggravated by the
steep slopes, in many places up to 20 or 30 per cent. Even under the natural vegetation
of Leleshwa (Tarconanthus camrhoratus), Whistling thorn (Acacia dreoanolobium) and
tufted perennial grasses such as Cvmbooopon sp., some erosion takes places especially
after a fire has reduced the cover of the ground. There was an extensive fire in February
1991, which caused a major reduction in ground cover and increased the potential for
natural erosion and the risk of sedimentation. However, by the middle of June, the cover
had improved significantly.
An erosion hazard map has been prepared (Figure 6.3.1) to indicate the potential for rill
and inter-rill erosion if vegetative cover is removed. It is based on slope and two categories
have been defined as follows: low to moderate erosion hazard (0 - 1 0 per cent slope) and
high to very high erosion hazard (over 10 per cent slope). The rate of erosion is roughly
proportional to the square of the slope expressed as a percentage (Hudson, 1981, Page
197). The figure of 10 per cent appears somewhat arbitrary but slope does not fall into
sharply defined categories and visual inspection supports the contention that the risk of
erosion and the problems of its control are much less below 10 per cent slope, than on
steeper land.
The following limitations to the brosion hazard map should be noted. Firstly there are some
steep areas, for example around Well 721, which have a lower hazard because they are
rocky. Further field work would be needed to define these areas. Secondly, it does not
reflect the problem of gully erosion which is often caused on low slopes by concentrated
runoff from higher ground.
The Drainage System and Sedimentation
The drainage system falls into three main areas. The main dividing line runs near to Wells
721, 713, 718, 717, 723 and 724.
To the north of this line there are several small valleys which drain the upper slopes and
6-10



discharge into the foot slopes and plains below without connecting to a common
watercourse. Sediment moving down the valleys is trapped in the grass on the lower
slopes. A good example of this is the area of grass and bush, 100 rn north of Well 71 5,
where the new power station may be constructed. It receives substantial quantities of
sediment from the gully below Well 707.
To the south of the main divide there is a well defined catchment of 388 ha in which the
valleys connect to a common watercourse (Plate 17) that runs past the existing power
station. Sediment moving in this catchment is deposited alongside the power station and
has to be removed periodically. Areas which contributed to this sediment in mid-1991
included the fill slopes of Wells 717, 718, spoil from the quarry near 705, and the gullies
below Well 713 and alongside the old road nearby.
To the north-east of the study area, there is an area of internal drainage of approximately
175 ha. At present there is not much sediment moving within this area. Any sediment
which does move is deposited in the grass on the lower slopes.
Where there have been no development activities, the valleys and drainage lines are well
vegetated and there is little sign of erosion. This is consistent with a pattern of ephemeral
stream flow and very low runoff rates. Where soil is deep and cover is intact, runoff is
minimal; but where soil is shallow or cover has been destroyed, significant runoff can be
expected during periods of heavy rainfall. Prior to development there was probably very
little runoff except when storms occurred soon after a major fire or after a period of severe
overgrazing.
Current Erosion Related to Power Development
The existing problems of erosion are related to the excavation of well pads, the discharge
of waste water and the construction of roads. Clearing of vegetation for the purpose of
laying pipelines has also contributed to the erosion problems but to a lesser extent. These
points will be considered in turn.
Well Pads
There are about 25 well pads which have been constructed in North East Olkaria. Each pad
measures about 60 - 70 m long and 30 - 40 m wide. The surface has been strengthened
by a layer of about 50 cm of compacted murram, consisting largely of rock fragments.
The spoil which has been excavated is pushed to the lower side. It has usually been
dumped in an irregular manner (Plate 18) but recently there has been an effort to smooth
the surface to a uniform slope on which grass can be planted (Plate 19). The cut slopes
range in height from about 2 to 7 m and in angle from 45 to 80 degrees. The fill slopes
have a similar range of height but are less steep and generally below 45 degrees. The
stability of slopes is discussed in greater detail later.
The exposure 'of an area of around 0.25 ha at each well site creates a major erosion
hazard. Erosion of cut slopes takes place by runoff and slumping but much of the
sediment is deposited at the foot. Erosion of fill slopes is more serious because of the lack
of compaction and because the sediment is likely to be carried further downslope. Runoff
which accumulates on the pad itself usually finds its way out through the fill slope and
where this has not been grassed, the potential for gully erosion is high. Appendix 6.3.2
gives an assessment of the erosion risk at each well pad at North East Olkaria.
The need to stabilise all bare surfaces with vegetation as quickly as possible has been

stressed during the impact study. Fortunately the soils are reasonably fertile and star
grass, which can be planted from splits and spreads rapidly, is indigenous to the area.
However, in spite of the need, almost the only planting which has been done has been on
the fill slopes of 714, 717 (Plate 19) and 726. These comments apply to mid to late
1991.
Waste Water
Waste water is discharged from well pads during two phases, the drilling phase and the
testing phase. In some situations this water has been discharged directly to a valley and
has created serious gullying. In others it has been discharged to a sump pond but several
ponds have breached and the sudden outflow has been responsible for gullying. Although
there is currently a greater attempt to control waste water and to pipe it from sump ponds
to the reinjection Well 708, much damage has already been done. There are major gullies
associated with Well 707, 709, 71 1, 712 and 713 due to failure to cope adequately with
waste water. The most serious gully is that in the valley below Well 713 which is now
up to about 10 m wide and 8 m deep in places. The gully sides are slumping and the
sediment in the floor can easily be transported and deposited in the channel by the
existing power station, if there is a heavy storm. The risk of gullying should be taken
much more seriously because once gullies develop they are hard to control. An attempt
to fill the gully below 709 with soil using a bulldozer was not successful as runoff simply
cut a new channel through the loose material which had not been compacted or stabilised
with grass (Plate 201.
Roads
Runoff fromn roads has the potential to cause serious erosion either in the drains which run
parallel to the road, in the mitre drains which discharge runoff into the bush or where
concentrated runoff is discharged from culverts. Provided the road surface itself is
stabilised vvith murram, as most of them are, and runoff is diverted at regular intervals
before it accumulates to problem levels, the situation can be kept under control. The
potential dangers are illustrated by the gully which has developed alongside the road to
Well 707. The gully has arisen due to a culvert which has become blocked.
Trouble arises with roads which are too steep such as that to Well 712. Discharge from
this road is aiready causing a gully to develop in the adjacent bush. Clearing land for roads
before determining the best alignment can cause serious problems as for example the road
which runs directly downsiope from Well 717. As it proved too steep it was replaced with
another road with a better alignment but at the time of writing, it still needs to be
revegetated.
During the construction phase there is likely to be much more traffic on the roads and
greater attention to road drainage will be needed.
Quarries
There is a quarry above Well 713 and another below 705. The former is in a rock area and
there is not much loose soil to be carried away. The latter has a large amount of loose
spoil which can easily be transported to a valley leading to the existing power station. It
should be stabilised urgently with grass.
6.3.2 Significance of Erosion
Soil erosion causes damage in several ways., On agricultural land the main problem is loss
6-1 3



of soil productivity. In North East Olkaria it is the formation of gullies and the deposition
of sediment.
Gullies are major sources of sediment and the gully below Well 71 3 is particularly serious
because sediment from it can be deposited at the power station. Gullies are also a hazard
to the unwary and pose a risk to hikers who may be roaming on foot through those areas
of Hell's Gate National Park, which are under development for geothermal power. Gullies
are also aesthetically unwelcome and in certain valleys they destroy the natural vegetation
which may be a habitat for interesting plants or birds.
North East Olkaria is an area of considerable natural beauty and land denuded of vegetation
is an eyesore. Every effort should be made to restore vegetative cover and repair damage
to the land as quickly as possible. How this should be done has already been discussed
with KPC's Environmental Monitoring Unit and is discussed further in Section 7.
Soil Fertility
The most likely impact of geothermal power development on soil fertility would be
connected with well testing and would be either from the disposai of waste water, or from
the condensation of steam on the adjacent vegetation. The current policy of re-injection
of waste water has minimised any potential damage. Those channels which have carried
waste water for several months, show only slight damage to the adjacent vegetation.
Waste water from the old Well no. 26, which is supplying steam to the existing power
station, has been running continuously down a small valley with minimal effect.
Preliminary indications are therefore that well testing does not have a serious impact on
soil fertility. However, in order to confirm this, soil samples were taken downwind at 50
to 100 m from the following wells, which are due to be tested: Well 712, 717, 718, 719,
720 and 721. These samples have been taken for analysis to the National Agricultural
Laboratories in Nairobi.
Well Pad Slope Stability
The stability of cut slopes and fill slopes depends on various factors such as the soil
texture and drainage, the amount and frequency of runoff from higher ground, the
likelihood of saturation during periods of heavy rainfall and the amount of overburden.
Stability implies that there will be no slumping and that erosion by rainfall or runoff will be
prevented by a permanent cover of vegetation on the cut slopes and fill slopes.
The soil has a low clay content and therefore very little cohesion but is deep and very well
drained. Saturation is most unlikely to occur as water will not be ponded. If the upslope
areas have a good vegetative cover, runoff should be infrequent and of limited amount.
The risk of slumping due to overburden is slight except with the abandoned well pad, NE-
G, which was cut into a very steep slope.
Ideally cut slopes should be battered to an angle of not more than about 35 degrees (70
per cent), which allows a safety margin below the theoretical limit for a cohesionless soil
given by the angle of internal friction (approximately 50 degrees for the soil samples listed
in Appendix 6.3.1). An angle of 35 degrees should permit vegetation to be established
easily.
Stabilisation of existing fill slopes requires little extra work apart from smoothing and
planting with star grass which should be a top priority whenever the ground is wet enough
6-14



or watering can be carri e cut. Although top soil and subsoil have been mixed up, there
appears to be adequate -nrtility (judging by the way grass grows in gully floors) to get
good establishment.
Stabilisation of cut slopes involves battering to an angle of about 35 degrees and planting
grass. This is a more diffizult exercise because it means exposing even more bare ground.
Cutting back an 80 degree slope of 7 m height to an angle of 35 degrees exposes an extra
9 metres of soil to erosicn by raindrop impact and runoff. Unless a complete cover of
grass is established quic.<dy, there is likely to be an even greater problem of erosion.
At present cut slopes, though unpleasant to look at, do not provide anything like the
quantities of sediment that come from the fill slopes and gullies. The reason is that much
of the soil that slumps, cr is washed down, remains on the pad itself at the foot of the cut
slope.
The best policy would be :o stabilise all existing bare ground, including the well pad itself,
and any cut slopes whic-. are not more than say 45 degrees, before tackling the steeper
cut slopes.
Any measures which ir.;olve further soil disturbance at the present stage before the
existing bare ground has seen revegetated will lead to increased problems of erosion and
sedimentation
Effects on Existing Power Station Infrastructure
Soil erosion is presently affecting the operation of the existing Olkaria Power Station
because sediment has tLen deposited along the eastern side of the power station (see
Figure 6.3.1). A report t, H P Gauff has been prepared to address this problem.
It proposes that flood v ater flowing down the drainage line to the east of the existing
power station should be ;revented from reaching the power station and should be diverted
along a concrete lined c&annel and discharged into Hell's Gate. The report rightly points
out that tthe most urger-: need is to arrest silt at its source and it makes proposal for
stabilisation of the well -3ds and the adjacent slopes by installing drains and establishing
vegetation cover.
The critical areas for revezetation are the bare surfaces associated with Well pads 718 and
717, the quarry slope near 705 and the gullies below 713. Until revegetation has been
carried out, it will be d;fficult to assess the seriousness of the siltation problem and
whether or not a diversicn channel is needed. It is possible that if the catchment area is
properly vegetated a di;.ersion channel would not be necessary. The reasons are as
follows:
o     The existing char-iels in the power station catchment are mainly well vegetated
and, just upstrear- of the road to Hell's gate, where it crosses the main channel,
there is no evider-:e of stream bank erosion and the channel sides are very well
vegetated with star grass. This is consistent with a flow that diminishes in velocity
and perhaps also n volume (through seepage in the banks and bed) as it moves
downstream. A c-annel that grows wider and deeper and has banks that become
increasingly bare _nd eroded, as occurs in some semi-arid areas, would be a much
better candidate -ar diversion
6-1 5



o     The gully below 7i3 has probably been a major contributor to sediment at the
power station but it was caused by waste water during well testing. This has now
stopped and the gully floor should stabilise with vegetation in due course.
O     The catchment is in a semi-arid zone with rainfall in the region of 20 - 40% of open
water evaporation. Soils are mainly deep and free draining. There is no overgrazing
and provided there are no fires, ground cover is good and there should be very little
runoff. The general absence of deeply incised drainage channels in the area is
consistent with a pattern of low runoff.
It is suggested that the first step should be to carry out revegetation of all bare surfaces
with star grass and/or rhodes grass as quickly as possible. This includes cut slopes, fill
slopes and well pads themselves - both old ones and new ones. Detailed recommendations
on this can be provided if needed.
Some temporary dams of poles and brushwood, or of stone, may be needed in gullies to
assist the process of stabilisation if the natural processes appear to be too slow. If
revegetation alone proves to be inadequate, the next step would be to install permanent
silt interceptor dams (check dams) in the channels which appear to be carrying most silt.
As mentioned by H.P. Gauff there are certain problems associated with this approach but
they can be overcome. Silt dams would help to dissipate energy of flood flow and cause
deposition of sediment. Grass would grow in the area of the reservoir and encourage
deposition. If the amount cf sediment became excessive, the sediment could be removed
during the dry season. A suggestion has been made that the interceptor dams should be
constructed in a manner wnich allows continual seepage through the wall so that they can
retain sediment but not water.
A diversion channel would :reate new problems in Hell's Gate and the proposal should only
be entertained if the above measures prove inadequate.
As part of determining baseline conditions there is a need to determine absolute height
datum for this area, against which subsequent subsidence (if any) can be measured.
Currently there is no Benchmark survey of North East Olkaria and it is essential that this
be established as soon as possible.
6.4. FAUNA
Introduction
This section describes the fauna of the North East Olkaria region. Of greatest importance
is the fauna of Hell's Gate National Park, located within North East Olkaria geothermal
development. This report gives a quantitative presentation of data and information
gathered with the aim of identifying unique and important habitats together with the
spatial and temporal patterns of habitat use by animals.
Density and distribution of large mammals, within Hell's Gate National Park, were
estimated by surveying along the road transect network. Only 33% (approximately) of the
park is accessible and utilised by the animals. During the surveys in the park, the species,
number of individuals, group and/or herd size, age category (adult, subadult, juvenile) were
recorded. In Kedong and .Kongoni ranches estimates were established by total counts
and/or population indices.
6-1 6



The avian community was assessed during mammal counts and routine systematic
searches and also from published materials. In addition, the report attempts to elucidate
the structure and dynamics of the fauna community and how it relates to vegetation,
topography and other features of the park. Detailed description of Hell's Gate National Park
fauna is followed by a description of Olkaria's mammals and birds. Appendices 6.4.1 and
6.4.2 list the mammals and birds of Hell's Gate National Park.
6.4.1 Mammals in Hell's Gate National Park Area
Numbers and Density
Twenty-three species of mammals were recorded; of these 14 were large herbivores and
3 were small herbivores. No elephants or rhinoceros were present in the park. In addition
the tally included the jackal, olive baboon, rocky hyrax, and the hedgehog. Reliable
evidence also indicated presence of the lion, leopard and the aardvark (Appendix 6.4.1).
Leopard is a threatened species according to the 1 990 IUCN Red List of Threatened
Animals. A variety of rat-like rodents, which are difficult to identify, were also recorded.
The study area is therefore characterised by low numbers of species and consequently low
species diversity. This could be due to the lack of a wide variety of habitats, or past
human and other influences.
Densities of the 1 4 large herbivores were established for Hell's Gate National Park, Kedong
Ranch and Kongoni Ranch (Tables 6.4.1 and 6.4.21. Two density values were established
for the park: one for the whole park area; and the other for the area that was normally
utilised by the herbivores. Density values of the latter were significantly higher for all the
fourteen species and indicated possibilities of habitat overuse and competition in future.
Densities of the herbivcres in Kedong and Kongoni ranches were much lower than in the
park.

There is limited movement of animals between Kedong Ranch and the park whose future
cannot be guaranteed without active involvement of the ranch ownership in the
management of the park.
As mentioned above, only part of the park (33%) is accessible and utilised by the animals.
Consequently everything should be done to make sure that the expansion of geothermal
activity in the current project does not reduce the useable area.
Within the park, animals move from open grassland (grazing areas) to the bushland areas.
For most species this occurs during the hot hours of the day. The reason for this
movement is to seek shade, however the animals also engage in limited grazing. Most of
the bushland is at higher elevation and access is only through natural erosion gullies.
These gullies should not be interfered with during any stages of the project cycle.

Community Structure
The large herbivores species show associations amongst themselves and preferences for
some habitats over others. Zebra often occur together with kongoni, this association
arises from ecological facilitation of grass leaves for kongoni by zebra, which eat the
tougher stalks and stems of grass. Thompson's gazelle and warthog often associate in
areas of very low grass, where herbs and soft grass are available. The aardvark occupies
slightly elevated areas in flat grassland areas or on gradual slopes, of under 45°, in
association with termites and mole rats.
6-1 8



The mean group and herd size for the large herbivores species is shown in Table 6.4.3.
These socio-organisation structures are similar to those of other areas. The small body-
sized herbivores do not form groups or herds due to their solitary lifestyle. These
herbivores require cover for protection together with a high quality diet of rare food items.

Distributiorl and Habitat Preferences
Distributiori of animals in the park is mainly determined by terrain (topography), vegetation
cover together with quality and quantity of food plants. Only 33% of the park offers
suitable habitat. Overall the distribution is clumped in this useable area. Zebra, kongoni,
Thompson's gazelle and wvarthog occupy the open grasslands. Steinbuck and klipspringer
both occupy steep bushy areas while giraffe and eland are found in the open bushland
areas. Ancither factor that influences the spatial and temporal patterns of habitat use is
water. Water is provided in troughs at waterholes at several points. Figure 6.4.1 shows
the distribution of major herbivores in the park.
No detailed studies were conducted on habitat preferences. Generally the open grassland
areas were most preferred. Open bushland areas followed and closed habitats were not
used at all. The open grasslands were dominated by Themeda triandra, Dipitaria scalarum
and Cvnodon dactylon. These three grass species formed the main component of the
grazers' diet.
In the bushland the giraffe was found to subsist mainly on Acacia dreganolobium.

Population Structure
The estimates of population structure were aimed at assessing the current performance
and predicting future trends of the populations of species in the park. Most species had
a low proportion of subadults and juveniles (Table 6.4.4). This is a sign of poor
recruitment and overall popuiation growth. Predation, limitation by food and nutrition,
disease and human influences can be the cause of the current situation.
Analysis to isolate the responsible factor(s) is in progress. Hopefully, after the cause is
determined, a better management of wildlife population couid be taken into consideration.
Sex ratios for most species deviated from   1:1  which is normal in most wildlife
communities. Due to the limited and poor quality of data no detailed analysis was carried
out.

Birds
Appendix 6.4.2 shows the species of birds occurring in Hell's Gate National Park. None
of the listed species is in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals.
One hundred and eight species of birds have been recorded in the park. During the survey
65 species of birds were recorded. During this survey the rare Lammergeyer or Bearded
Vulture which has been recorded previously was not recorded. However it is worthwhile
noting that this species has not been seen in the park for decades and was probably never
a common bird in the park. No attempt was made to estimate population size of the
avifauna.
The avifauna is diverse because of habitat heterogeneity and also because of proximity to
Lake Naivasha. The cliffs and gorges are important breeding grounds for vultures, swifts
and other species. The vultures move in from far places while the swifts engage in
displays, nesting and mating during the rainy season.
The maintenance of natural habitat of these breeding grounds is a concern which should
be given special focus. Dusts, gases, and destruction of vegetation all have the potential
6-21



to affect the bird life.
Impact Assessment Issues of Concern
These matters will be adressed in the impact assessment section.
1.      Possible contraction of the scarce and limited herbivores habitats which already
show signs of overuse and congestion.
2.      Active involvement of ranch owners and intensive management of large mammal
populations. Kedong ranch can offer a refuge and migratory area during the full
project cycle.
3.      Ensuring that the current limited movement of animals from low grassland areas
to higher elevations and bushland cover areas is not interfered with.
Development of infrastructure and physical facilities has the potential to interfere
with current movement routes and gullies.
4.      That effluents and gases from the geothermal facility may destroy vegetation
cover which provides food, shelter and cover for mammals and birds. Special
attention and care for the 33% of the park area that is used by animals. Special
attention to negative impacts on preferred food plants.
5.      Possible negative impacts on the current interspecific association together with
intraspecific social organisation structures of large herbivores, and the possible
effects of the project on the population recruitment rate which is currently low
for most species.
6.      Impacts of the project on the cliffs which are important and rare breeding
grounds for some bird species.
7.      Further overall insularization of the fauna of Hell's Gate National Park.
8.      Acceptable pressures from the project and tourism.
9.      Role of the proposed Geothermal Project in the improvement of infrastructure,
planning and active management of the park.
Animal Distribution and Density
North East Olkaria, though not part of the major areas used (by herbivores) has significant
numbers of buffalo, giraffe, kongoni, eland, Thompsons and Grants gazelle, impala and
warthog. The buffalo spend most of the day in the (narrow valleys) gullies vegetated by
thick bushland. These areas provide cover from human disturbance and shade during the
heat of the day. During the night, the buffalos move down to the flat grassland dominated
areas on lower elevations, for grazing. During the dry season the buffalos occupy the
upper elevation open grassland and bushed grassland areas during the day and move down
through the permanent and well established trails and routes. These routes are shown in
Figure 6.4.1. Some of these routes follow the gullies thereby facilitating gradual access
and avoidance of the exposed steep areas.
Zebras and kongoni also use the higher ground during the dry season and move down to
lower grassland areas for water and nocturnal grazing. The grazing is mainly along the
6-22



main tar-road to Olkaria Geothermal Station and the open lawn behind the park's Olkaria
Gate. There is also considerable movement between the spatially limited flat top'ridges
shown in Figure 6.4.1. The two species also concentrate in upper open flat grassland
areas during the wet season. Since zebra and kongoni are water dependent species, they
disperse all over the North East Olkaria area during the wet season where water availability
is also widespread.
The warthog occupies open grassland areas. This habitat preference is mainly due to
avoidance of predators in more closed bushland areas. The limited open grassland areas
are therefore vital for this species' continued occupance and survival in North East Olkaria.
Thompson's gazelle habits are the same as those of the warthog. The "tomie" however,
occupies open grassland areas at lower elevation. Tomie and warthog also prefer areas
characterised by low-grassland. These areas provide easy access and availability of soft
grass and hierbs for the tomie and warthog together with roots and tubers for the warthog.
Eland is mainly a browser but the range of food items broadens during the wet season to
include some grass species. The eland occupies the Tarchonanthus open bushiands in
North East Olkaria. Often it is found in association with zebra and kongoni. Eland displays
the diurnal and seasonal movements from upper to lower areas and vice-versa.
The eland ilso uses the bushland to cool off during the hottest part of the day. Its activity
patterns have changed since drilling started in North East Olkaria, becoming mainly a
nocturnal feeder in North East Olkaria. This shows that unlike the kongoni and zebra
which can still be seen not far from human activity during the day, the shy eland has to
wait till dark to start feeding.
Impala were found to occupy bushland grassland ecotone areas. Like most other species
they have moved out from North East Olkaria due to the drilling activity. The more solitary
steinbuck and klipspringer have also retreated to higher elevations.
Klipspringer, steinbuck and dik-dik occupy permanent territories. The species are very
selective feeders. The permanent residency in a territory makes them acquire knowledge
on the locations of the rare food items thereby enhancing feeding and survival. The
territory owner(s) also knows the best areas to hide when attacked or threatened by a
predator.  Displacement from a territory and attempts to establish a new territory,
therefore, can expose the species to predators and inadequate nutrition.
Movements and Migration Corridors
Figure 6.4.1 shows the movement routes within the park and migration corridors between
the park and the surrounding areas. The site of the proposed power station has been
surveyed intensively to provide information that can be used in the layout of the pipelines.
The layout shouid be such as to ensure the minimum disruption that is practical to the
indicated migration routes. Animals concentrate more in the park during the dry season.
This is because of the provision of water holes, or waste water from human settlements.
During the wet season the animals are widespread both within and outside the park in
areas which offer suitable feeding areas. During the dry season, the herbivores gradually
shift from open grassland and open bushed grassland feeding areas to more bushed areas.
They do so to shelter from the heat of the day. The routes (trails),which the animals use
in the course of these movements are permanent and have been used for a very long time.
Disruption of these routes should therefore be avoided.

Some Impacts of Current Activities at North East Olkaria
1.     Habitat destruction: by roads; resultant gully erosion and drilling platforms. The
road network seems unnecessarily extensive. The platforms are too large (about
1 00Om2 on average) especially when compared with those in the old Olkaria Power
Station.
2.     Habitat change: Soil disturbance along roads and at platforms has caused invasion
by Cvnodon dactvlon, a less nutritious grass species.
3.     Animals drinking water from the drilling sites.
4.     Change in activity patterns, habitat preference and habitat utilisation.
5.     Disappearance (local extinction or movement to other areas) of dik-dik and other
solitary species.
6.     Roads cutting across, within park, movement trails.
6.5 CLIMATE AND METEOROLOGY
6.5.1 Monitoring Programme
Information on local meteorological conditions is important for assessing the dispersion of
gaseous emissions from sources associated with the development. Dispersion of stack
emissions is influenced by wind speed, wind direction, temperature, atmospheric stability
class1 and the height of the mixed-layer2.
The following section provides a brief description of the climate and meteorology of the
area. It includes a review.v of the wind conditions as well as a summary of data on
temperature, humidity, rainfall and evaporation. For temperature, humidity, rainfall and
evaporation, long-term data bases have been used to describe the environment. For wind
conditions and the dispersion modelling studies, data collected by two specially installed
meteorological stations have been used.
Monitoring Program
The monitoring program was designed to provide data suitable for use with a computer-
based dispersion model, which has been used to simulate hydrogen sulphide dispersion and
to provide general climatic and meteorological data. Because initially two sites were
1 In dispersion modelling, stability -!ass is used to categorise the dispersive capacity of the atmosphere,
that is, the rate at which a plume will disperse. In the Pasquill-Gifford stability class assignment scheme used
in this study, there are six stab ty classes A through to F. Class A relates to unstable conditions such as.
might be found on a sunny day with !ight winds. In such conditions, plumes will spread rapidly usually
resulting in high ground-level ccncentrat,ons close an elevated source and rapidly decreasing concentrations
downwind. Class F relates to s:able ccnditions such as occur when the sky is clear, the winds are light and
an inversion is present. Plume spreadir.g is slow in these circumstances. The intermediate classes B, C, D
and E relate to intermediate disoersion conditions.
2 The term mixed-layer heignt refers the height of the turbulent layer of air near the earth's surface into
which ground-level emissions will be rapidly mixed. A plume emitted above the mixed-layer will remain
isolated from the ground until s.;ch time as the mixed-layer reaches the height of the plume. The height of
the mixed-layer is controlled mainly by convection tdue to solar heating of the ground) and by mechanical
turbulence resulting from turbu!ence as the wind blowing over the rough ground.

considered for the siting of the power station, tvvo sites were monitored. This has also
allowed the effects of terrain on wind speed and wind direction to be evaluated.
One meteorological station was established near X2-Camp (X2 Station) and the other
(North East Station) was sited approximately 2 km to the east (see Figure 6.5.1). These
have been operated since early 1991. A perspective view of the area is shown in Figure
6.5.2.
Each site is equipped with a microprocessor-controlled weather station. The two stations
are identical except that the North East Station supplements a conventional meteorological
station, which has been operated by KPC's Environmental Unit for several years. The two
microprocessor stations monitor the following parameters:
o     Wind speed and wind direction at 1 0 m above local ground level using a Met
One 024A wind direction sensor and a 014A wind speed sensor (starting
speeds 0.5 m/s)
o     Temperature at 1.5 m using a Unidata Model 6505D ambient temperature
sensor
o     Humidity at 1.5 m using a Unidata Model 6505D humidity sensor
o     Solar radiation using a Unidata Model 6505D global radiation sensor
o     Rainfall using a Model 6506A tipping bucket rain gauge (0.2 mm resolution)
Data from these sensors are sampled every five seconds and average values of the
sampled wind speed, wind direction, temperature, humidity and solar radiation are logged
to a solid state memory every ten minutes. Rainfall data is logged at the end of each ten-
minute period and value logged is the total rain during the ten minute interval.
The memory in the loggers has sufficient capacity to store over one month of data. Data
are transferred to a computer for checking and subsequent processing at approximately
one month intervals.
In addition, the North East Station is equipped with a Stevenson screen containing wet and
dry-bulb thermometers, and a Lambrecht Thermohygrograph, which makes continuous
records of humidity and temperature. A conventional rain gauge and Class-A evaporation
pan are also in place. The rain gauge and evaporation pan are read at 9 am each day and
the other instruments are read at 9 am and 3 pm.
Table 6.5.1 summarises the data available from the two microprocessor-controlled weather
stations.
Examples of the format of the data collected by the microprocessor controlled weather
stations and the format of the processed data used in the dispersion modelling studies are
shown in Appendix 6.5.1.

Station (which is on higher ground, limited data presented) shows that the high ground to
the north and east of the proposed power station (close to X2-Camp) has a very significant
effect on the winds that would transport and disperse emissions. At the lower site, winds
from the north and east are essentially blocked by the terrain. The perspective diagram
showing the local terrain illustrates the broad features of the land-form. The terrain forms
a funnel that steers the wind into the northwesterly and southeasterly directions that are
shown on the wind roses in Figures 6.5.3.
Temperature
Hourly data from the X2-Camp meteorological station have been used for the dispersion
modelling studies. However, to describe climatic features of the area such as temperature
and other parameters, it is more useful to review the longer record of data available from
the East Olkaria Power Station. Plots of monthly average maximum and minimum
temperatures for 1 985 to 1988 are shown in Figure 6.5.5. It can be seen that the annual
range in average monthly maximum temperatures is from 21 to 29 C. For minimum
temperatures the range is even less, from 1 1 to 1 5 C. The warmest period of the year is
generally February and the coolest June. A secondary warm period occurs in September.
October and December, with a slight decrease in monthly average maximum temperature
in November.
Humidity
Monthly average 9 am and 3 pm humidity observations are presented in Figure 6.5.6. As
expected these show higher humidities at 9 am than at 3 pm. Lower monthly average
values of humidity are close to 30 per cent and high values are marginally above 90 per
cent.
Rainfall
Rainfall data are presented in Figure 6.5.7. These data have been collected from three
data bases: Naivasha Water Supply Department (24 years from 1965-88), Naivasha
District Office (79 years 1910-88) and Kongoni Ranch (21 years 1968-88). Annual rainfall
received by these three stations is similar: long-term annual averages have been 697 mm
for the Naivasha Water Supply Department site, 625 mm for the Naivasha District Office
and 673 mm for Kongoni Ranch. For all sites the wettest month is April followed by May
and the driest month is July for the Naivasha Water Supply Department, January for the
District Office and August for Kongoni Ranch.
Evaporation
Evaporation data for Naivasha Township (29 years 1959-87) and Kongoni Ranch (Office)
(31 years 1957-87) are presented in Figure 6.5.8. Annual average evaporation for
Naivasha Township and Kongoni Farm was 1912 and 1763 mm, respectively. Annually,
evaporation exceeds rainfall by more than a factor of two. This, combined with the very
porous nature of the soils, accounts for the arid nature of the area. As expected the
maximum Ervaporation for both sites occurs during the warmer periods, namely February
and March and October and November.
6.5.2 Meteorological Data File for Modelling and Description of Dispersion Conditions
For dispersion modelling an hourly meteorological data file has been developed from the
Lambrecht wind recorder data and the 10-minute data collected at X2-Camp. It also
includes some temperature data from the North East Station for the initial period (1
November 1990 to 2 February 1991) before temperature recording equipment was
included at the X2-Camp.

It was decided to use data from X2-Camp rather than the North East Station because the
power station site lies in the base of the valley (see Figures 6.5.1 and 6.5.2). Plume
buoyancy will of course take the plume to higher levels where the wind patterns that apply
at the North East Station will begin to have some influence, but it was judged that the X2-
Camp data would better represent conditions experienced by the dispersing plume. Further
information on estimated plume rise from the proposed and existing power station is
presented in impact assessment section (Section 7).
As discussed in Section 6.5.1, the dispersion modelling file requires information on wind
speed, wind direction, temperature, atmospheric stability and mixed-layer height. Wind
speed and direction data have been taken either directly from the monitored data after
averaging, or for the period when Lambrecht wind recorder data was used (November
1990, December 1991 and five per cent of February 1991) hourly average wind speed and
wind direction have been read from the wind recorder charts. The standard deviation of
wind direction (sigma-theta) has been determined using the procedure described in Slade
(1 968).
The remainder of the wind speed and wind direction data have been taken from the
Unidata data logger. The hourly average wind speed has been taken to be the arithmetic
average of the 1 0-minute averages recorded by the data logger and the hourly average
wind direction has been taken to be the vector average of the 1 0-minute average wind
vectors. The estimate of sigma-theta has been obtained from the recorded wind direction
data.
Temperature data for the initial period have been estimated from monthly average data
collected at the East Olkaria power station. The hourly temperatures have been estimated
by fitting a sinusoidal function that gives a maximum daily temperature at 3 pm and
oscillates about the mean monthly temperature with an amplitude determined by the mean
monthly maximum and minimum temperatures. For the remainder of the data set the
hourly temperatures have been the arithmetic averages of the 10-minute data.
Atmospheric stability has been determined using the scheme outlined by Mitchell (1982)
in which sigma-theta data are used to determine the prevailing Pasquill-Gifford stability
class.
Mixed-layer height is a measure of the depth (or height) of the layer of turbulent (well-
mixed) air close to the ground. The depth can vary from zero to several thousand metres
above ground-level. In dispersion models, this information is used to calculate the volume
of air in which emissions will ultimately be mixed. The top of the mixed-layer is capped
by an inversion, which may be thought of as a lid through which the pollution cannot pass
unless the plume is sufficiently buoyant to penetrate the inversion. If the plume rise takes
the plume above the mixed-layer then the plume will remain isolated from the ground. This
may be the case at night, or in the early morning. If the plume is emitted below the top
of mixed-layer, then it will be trapped within the mixed-layer. In many cases the precise
value of the mixed-layer has only a marginal influence on the predicted ground-level
concentration, but it is important that the meteorological data file contains a representative
range of mixed-layer heights likely to be encountered in the course of a year.
Information on mixed-layer heights can be obtained using balloon-borne temperature and
humidity sensors, or by using remote sensing instruments. For dispersion modelling,
estimates are required for each hour of the day. Both balloon-borne sensors and remote
sensing  techniques are expensive and most dispersion modelling studies use the
alternative approach of providing estimates using theoretical methods with some field
6-36



observations. For the present study the latter method has been used.
Typically the mixed-layer height will be least at night. usually in the pre-dawn period.
Following sunrise, the ground will be warmed and convection will cause the air near the
ground to become well-mixed. The maximum height of the mixed-layer will occur in the
early afternoon and may be 1 000 m or more above ground level. On days when the wind
is strong, the mixed-layer will be determined largely by mechanical turbulence, which is
generated by the wind blowing over the rough terrain.  On days when there are
thunderstorms mixing of the air caused by the rain (and associated processes causing the
rain) will give rise to large values of mixed-layer.
For the present study, where the emission points are only 20 m or so above ground-level
and plume rise is small (see Section 7.4), it is of little practical importance whether the
maximum mixed-layer depth is 500 m or 2000 m and the use of theoretical methods to
estimate mixed-layer heights is justified, provided a wide range of mixed-layer heights is
used in the data file. This will ensure that model predictions do in fact include days where
the mixing-height could determine the maximum value of ground-level concentration.
The approach used has been to estimate mixed-layer height using theoretical procedures
developed by boundary-layer meteorologists over a number of years. For the day (one
hour after sunrise to one hour before sunset), these have been based on radiosonde data
collected by the Meteorological Department in Nairobi. These data have been used to
provide an indication of the maximum daily mixed-layer heights that are to be expected in
the Rift Valley. The procedure adopted is that outlined by Powell (1976). A quasi-
sinusoidal function, with its minimum value at sunrise and a maximum value 10 hours after
sunrise (approximately 4 pm), is used to represent the day time variation in mixed-layer
height. The equation for the mixed-layer height (h) can written as follows:

6.6 AIR ClUALITY
This section considers air quality issues. It identifies the matters which are important in
assessing the air quality impacts from the proposed power station, discusses how the
impacts will be assessed, reviews air quality criteria for assessment and presents the
results of some air quality monitoring.
6.6.1 Air Quality Issues
The local setting and a description of the project are presented in Sections 2.0 and 5.0,
respectively. The predominant land uses in the area are conservation (Hell's Gate National
Park), grazing and flower cultivation. Some scattered residential developments (worker
housing, private residences and tourist accommodation) are located nearby, mainly to the
north and to the east of the proposed power station site (see Figure 6.5.1).
The main gaseous emissions from the power station are carbon dioxide, hydrogen
sulphide, hydrogen, nitrogen and methane. Of these, hydrogen sulphide is the only
emission likely to have significant local environmental effects.  Carbon dioxide and
methane are greenhouse gases and may have some global impact, but these will be dealt
with separately.
6.6.2 Review of Hydrogen Sulphide Properties
This section is a review of the properties of hydrogen sulphide and the air quality criteria
that have been formulated by regulatory bodies in other countries to maintain acceptable
environmental quality. Criteria which are appropriate for local conditions at Olkaria are
discussed.
At present, Kenyan authorities in common with authorities in many other countries, have
not formulated ambient air quality standards. However, for the present study it is
necessary to establish criteria by which the effects of the project can be assessed. As
discussed earlier the only atmospheric emission with the potential to cause local pollution,
is hydrogen sulphide.
Occurrence of Hydrogen Sulphide
Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is a noxious and potentially poisonous gas, with the odour of
rotten eggs. It occurs naturally, and approximately 90 per cent of global emissions are
estimated to be of natural origin (WHO 1987). It has long been recognised as a potential
health threat to man both from natural and man-made sources and there are over 1 50
years of scientific literature describing its properties and toxicity (see review by the
Subcommittee on Hydrogen Sulfide, 1979). However, it is not a widespread urban
pollutant and is generally localised near emission sources such as sewage treatment plants,
petroleum refineries and kraft paper mills.
Typical concentrations vary widely in different parts of the world, for example, over a 2.5
6-38



year period in northwest London, concentrations were generally found to be less than
0.0002 ppm (0.3 ,ug/mr3). In and around the city of Rotorua, New Zealand there is usually
sufficient hydrogen sulphide to cause detectable odours and during continuous monitoring
hydrogen sulphide concentrations of 0.05 ppm (80 pg/m3) were exceeded for more than
55 per cent of the time in winter (WHO, 1987).
Properties
Hydrogen sulphide is colourless, flammable, denser3 than air and liquefies at -60 °C. It
is soluble in both polar and non-polar solvents and is rapidly oxidised in air and in solution.
It is corrosive to many metals and may discolour paint by its reaction with the metals
present in the pigments. Because of its density when it is concentrated, it will have a
negative buoyancy and sink to the lowest point. In geothermal projects it is usually
associated with high concentrations of carbon dioxide which is also denser than air. Thus
a slow leak of the non-condensable fraction of cooled geothermal gas emitted into a
sheltered environment, can allow a build-up of dangerous concentrations of hydrogen
sulphide in low-lying or sheltered and enclosed areas. Such areas are unlikely to be
naturally occurring topographical features such as gullies or valleys, but could be the
concreted cellars that are part of the well-heads, or sumps within the power station.
The controlled discharge of non-condensable gases from the power station may contain
initially up to approximately 4.9 per cent hydrogen sulphide and 96 per cent carbon dioxide
(Ewbank Preece Limited, 1989 (Page B/16)). This mixture is initially denser than air, but
it is mixed very rapidly with the ambient air. For practical purposes, the hydrogen sulphide
emitted from the gas ejectors will not preferentially settle out from the plume any more
than the oxygen, which comprises approximately 20 per cent of the ambient air, will settle
out from the less dense nitrogen, which forms approximately 78 per cent of the ambient
air. The only time when this is likely to be a potential safety hazard, is in enclosed areas.
There is considerable variation in the response of the human nose to odour. A range of
odour thresholds (where 50 per cent of the population can detect the presence of the
odour) have been reported for hydrogen sulphide (0.76-3.21 ug/fm3) 0.00047-0.002 ppm
(Warren Springs Laboratory, 1980). Other studies give different values. The most
recently published study (Nagy, 1991) presents detailed information on the percentage of
people responding to the odour of hydrogen sulphide at different concentrations. Nagy's
paper is particularly useful because it provides information on the response of the 18
people in the two odour panels as the concentration varies. From the data it is possible to
determine the percentage of people who would be expected to detect the odour at a given
concentration. One person out of the 1 8 (approximately 5 per cent) reported an odour at
0.0013 ppm4 (2 ,ug/m 3), nine of the 18 (50 per cent) detected the odour at 0.0046 ppm
(7 pg/m 3) and 17 of the 18 (approximately 95 per cent) reported the odour at 0.023 ppm
3  If the specific gravity of air is taken as 1.00 then the specific gravity of H2S gas is 1.189.
4 Note: in converting from Ugm 3 it has been assumed that the pressure is 760 mm of Hg and the
temperature is 0 'C. At Olkaria the pressure is typically 80 per cent of seal-level pressure. While there is no
information on the way in which humans respond to odour as pressure changes, it is known that odour is
sensed by molecuies of odourant stimulating odour-sensing cells in the nose, consequently it is likely that the
intensity of an odour will depend on the number of molecules of odourant per unit votume. Thus UgIm 3 would
be a more fundamental variable when discussing odour. However most people are more familiar with the units
ppm so, in the impact assessment section, the adjustment has been made and concentration has been
expressed as ppm at 80 per cent atmospheric pressure. This adjustment has also been made for the
dispersion model predictions.
6-39



(35 ug/rm 3).
Nagy also provides information about the number of people describing the odour at a
complaint level as the concentration varies. Approximately five percent consider the odour
at a complaint level at 0.0017 ppm (2 ,ug/m 3), 50 per cent at 0.016 ppm (20 ugim 3) and
95 per cent at 0.247 ppm (395 ,g/rm 3).
At the above concentrations, no harmful effects to human health are known. At higher
concentrations, where it is extremely toxic, it produces complete fatigue of the olfactory
nerve and its presence cannot be detected. Its odour therefore serves as an important
warning of its presence at safe concentrations.
In the above discussion, it should be remembered that the odour panel studies select
panellists who pass a test which ensures a certain minimum sensitivity to odours and they
are not permitted to eat, drink flavoured beverage or smoke for 30 minutes prior to the
test, nor are they permitted to use scented cosmetics for at least one hour before the test.
In addition, the test room is free of interfering odours. Given test conditions and the fact
that people regularly exposed to hydrogen sulphide have a decreased sensitivity to its
odour, it is considered that using these criteria for assessing the response of the exposed
population at Olkaria may significantly overstate the incidence of odour. The criteria would
be more appropriate for short-term visitors, but they would still be subject to interfering
odours.
Effects on Humans and Other Animal Life
The toxic effects of hydrogen sulphide vary according to the dosage and have been
classified in the scientific literature into three categories, namely, acute, sub-acute and
chronic. In view of some lack of agreement in the literature about these different
nomenclatures, the Subcommittee on Hydrogen Sulfide has determined some clarifying
definitions of these terms.
Acute intoxication refers to the effects of a single exposure to a massive dose of hydrogen
sulphide of the order of 1000 ppm  (1.61 g/m3).  There is evidence that at this
concentration hydrogen sulphide exerts an effect on the whole nervous system by
inhibiting the enzyme cytochrome oxidase, which is involved in the aerobic metabolic
pathway. The symptoms are an initial stimulation of respiration resulting in very rapid
breathing and subsequent depletion of carbon dioxide in the blood. This leads to
respiratory inactivity that may spontaneously reverse if the depletion has not gone too far.
However, if breathing does not spontaneously recommence and artificial respiration is not
given, death from suffocation occurs. At concentrations above 1000 ppm (1.61 g/m3),
hydrogen sulphide may have a direct paralysing effect on the nervous system. In this case
no stimulation of breathing occurs and there is immediate respiratory failure. However the
heart does not stop beating immediately and artificial respiration can be given until the
levels of hydrogen sulphide in the bloodstream drop sufficiently to allow breathing to
resume. Hlydrogen sulphide is very rapidly oxidised in the blood and is not considered a
cumulative poison.
Sub-acute intoxication refers to the effects of continuous exposure to mid-level
concentrations of hydrogen sulphide, 100-600 ppm  (0.16-0.96 g/m3).  At these
concentrations irritation of the mucous membranes of the eye and all of the respiratory
tract can occur. While eye irritation is by far the most common symptom of sub-acute
poisoning, irritation of the respiratory tract can in some circumstances lead to severe and
even fatal complications such as pulmonary oedema.
6-40



Chronic intoxication is defined as the effects of intermittent exposure to low or
intermediate concentrations 50-100 ppm (80-1 60 mg/m3) of hydrogen sulphide. These are
characterised by "lingering" largely subjective manifestations of illness. There is no
universal agreement in the literature about this category as a clinical entity distinct from
repeated episodes of sub-acute intoxication.
The effects of hydrogen sulphide exposure at various concentrations are summarised in
Table 6.6.1 (adapted from "Hydrogen Sulfide", The Subcommittee on Hydrogen Sulfide,
1979 and including data from Nagy, 1991).
The effects of hydrogen sulphide on other animal species have been the subject of
laboratory investigation and some insights into the biochemical mechanisms by which the
gas exerts its toxic effects have resulted from this work. The toxicity of hydrogen
sulphide for several species is summarised in Table 6.6.2 and compared with the effects
on humans (prepared from data published in "Hydrogen Sulfide", Subcommittee on
Hydrogen Sulfide, 1979 and WHO, 1987).
The symptoms of hydrogen sulphide poisoning are similar across species and as can be
seen from Table 6.6.2, the susceptibility of different animal species does not vary greatly.
6.6.3 Effects on Vegetation and Aquatic Animals
The effects of hydrogen sulphide on vegetation are not well documented largely because,
in contrast to animals, there appears to be a wide variation in response across species.
Sulphide taken up by plants is primarily metabolised to sulphate, or incorporated into plant
proteins and as in the case of sulphur dioxide, low concentrations may have a growth-
stimulating, or fertiiising effect. At higher concentrations, hydrogen sulphide can cause
leaf lesions, defoliation and reduced growth, with young plants being the most susceptible.
A study by Thompson and Kats (1978) who were investigating the effects of continuous
hydrogen sulphide fumigation on crops and forest plants, showed that concentrations in
the range 0.3-3 ppm (0.48-4.82 mgIm3) caused injury that was correlated with dosage.
Rapidly growing species such as grapes, alfalfa and lettuce were more damaged than the
more slowly growing buckeye and ponderosa pine. Sugar beets were more resistant to
hydrogen sulphide than the other fast growing crops. Lower doses (0.03-0.1 ppm (0.05-
0.16 mg/im3)) caused stimulation of growth to some of the rapidly growing species that
appeared to be related to other environmental factors such as day length, humidity or
temperature. The biochemical basis for hydrogen sulphide toxicity in plants is not well
understood.
Potential effects on flora, even low-level effects, are particularly important for the Olkaria
development because of the proximity of commercially important flower farms, which are
located approximately 1.2 km to the northwest of the proposed power station site. For
this reason KPC have initiated a series of flower growing trials at two sites; one 0.6 km
and the 1.2 km to the northwest of the existing power station's cooling towers. These
flower trials have been set up to determine the sensitivity of the commercially most
important flowers grown nearby. This issue is discussed further in Section 7.1.3

The effects of hydrogen sulphide on aquatic animals has been evaluated. In his report on
the environmental impacts of a geothermal power plant in New Zealand, Axtmann (197 1)
discussed the effect of dissolved hydrogen sulphide on the eggs and fry of rainbow trout
inhabiting a river used to receive waste water from a geothermal power station. He
concluded that only concentrations in the water of less than 0.006 ppm were safe.
Experiments with algae indicate that differences in metabolism may be the cause of
different susceptibilities. Since the possibility of hydrogen sulphide contamination of
significant bodies of water is not a credible event for the Olkaria geothermal field, this
matter is not discussed further.
6.6.4 Effects on Materials
Hydrogen sulphide is corrosive to metals including copper, silver and even gold. It also
reacts with lead-based paints to produce discolouration.  Apart from  aesthetic
considerations, this corrosion of metals can cause problems with malfunction in electronic
equipment when connecting wires are affected.
6.6.5 Air Quality Criteria for Hydrogen Sulphide
The setting of air quality standards is based on considerations of health and amenity.
Clearly, concentrations must be set that protect against adverse impacts on human well-
being. However, in the case of odorous compounds it may be necessary to set limits
lower than those at which no effect on human health is experienced. In addition, the
effects of pollutants on flora, fauna and materials is a matter for consideration. For
hydrogen sulphide all of these factors should be taken into account and ideally criteria that
protect against all adverse impacts adopted.
Threshold Limit Values
A distinction needs to be made between air quality standards for the ambient air and those
for the workplace, the latter being referred to as threshold limit values (TLV). TLVs are
those doses that cause no apparent harm to workers exposed for eight hours a day, five
days a week. In the United States the TLV for hydrogen sulphide is set at 10 ppm (15
mg/mr3).
Ambient Air Quality
Several countries have adopted both long and short-term hydrogen sulphide standards for
ambient air quality criteria (see Table 6.6.3, prepared from data published by the
Subcommittee on Hydrogen Sulfide (1979) and from information published by WHO
(1987)). The US EPA has not yet formulated a standard for hydrogen sulphide although
several states in the United States have developed independent regional standards.
Selected examples that span the range of criteria are also presented in Table 6.6.3.
The short-term concentrations are generally higher than those for long-term exposure and
it is useful to note that short-term exposure to a given concentration of pollutant will in
general have less effect than a long-term exposure to the same concentration. Therefore
the air quality standards for long-term exposure are usually lower than those for short-term
exposure.
The most stringent air quality goal presented in Table 6.6.3 is based on considerations of
odour and is applied by the Victorian Environment Protection Authority (VEPA) (Australia).
VEPA sets a goal of 0.0001 ppm (0.14 iggm3) for the maximum 3-minute average ground-
6-43



level concentration of hydrogen sulphide. This value is approximately 20 per cent of the
odour threshold of 0.00047 ppm (0.76 pug/m3), which is the lowest odour threshold
reported in the literature. The vaiue is referred to in Victoria, as the design ground-level
concentration and it is used by VEPA as the objective, which must not be exceeded when
determining stack heights. The reason for selecting an air quality criteria that is apparently
iess than the odour threshold and well below the concentration at which any health effects
have been reported, is that the concentration is expressed as a 3-minute average. The
human nose responds to odour exposures of the order of seconds. During any 3-minute
period, concentrations at ground-level close to a stack emitting a pollutant may fluctuate
by as much as ten times the average value, so that if the 3-minute average air quality goal
is set at the odour threshold, this value will be exceeded some of the time. For this reason
a level of one-fifth to one-tenth of the odour threshold is usually set as the maximum 3-
minute average concentration to protect against such impacts. In practical terms this
would result in little or no detectable odour of hydrogen sulphide at ground-level. This is
clearly not a necessary goal for all areas, in particular areas such as Olkaria, or for example
Rotorua, vvhere natural hydrogen suiphide emissions occur.
The implications of applying the VEPA air quality criteria to the Olkaria project are that
human health and amenity would be protected. In addition, in view of the similarity of the
response of other animal species to hydrogen sulphide, no adverse impacts are likely to
be experienced by the local fauna. For continuous exposure, levels of hydrogen sulphide
that are 300 times the odour threshold may be damaging to crops. Thus the adoption of
the VEPA criteria should protect against crop damage. Similarly it is unlikely that at these
levels there would be any significant deterioration of materials, particularly metals, in the
vicinity of the plant. However, in practical terms this is an unrealistic goal as the stack
concentration of hydrogen sulphide in a 64 MWe power station will be of the order of 4.5
g/m3. To achieve the VEPA ground-level concentrations a dilution of over 32 million
would be needed.  The VEPA goal is not considered appropriate for the present
environment.
The approach adopted is to select criteria that protect human health, local crops and
fauna, but will not protect all areas against an odour impact. The WHO (1987) provide
useful guidance in this respect (for non-occupational exposure), where it states the
following:
1.    "The lowest-adverse health effect of hydrogen sulphide is 1 5 mg/m3 (9.9 ppm),
when eye irritation is caused. In view of the steep rise in dose-effect curve implied
by reports of serious eye damage at 70 mg/m3 (46 ppm), a relatively high (safety)
protection factor of 100 is recommended, leading to a guideline value of 0.10 ppm
(0.1 5 mg/mr3) with an averaging time of 24-hours."
2.    ".. In order to avoid substantial complaints about odour annoyance among the
exposed population, hydrogen sulphide concentrations should not be allowed to
exceed 0.0046 ppm (7 ug/m3), with a 30 minute averaging period .........
The inforrriation presented by Nagy (1991) appears consistent with (2) and allows the
incidence of odour events to be estimated. This will form the basis of the impact
assessment presented in Section 7.
6.6.6 Summary and Recommendations for Air Quality Criteria
There are no ambient air quality criteria for hydrogen sulphid"e currently in force in Kenya.
Geothermail wells emit substantial quantities of this gas and it is necessary to set some
6-44



targets that define environmentally acceptable levels.
As an interim measure it is suggested that the WHO 24-hour guideline should be used to
assess impacts beyond the immediate power station boundary. That is 24-hour average
concentrations should not be permitted to be above 0.10 ppm (0.1 5 mg/mr3), beyond the
immediate power station boundary.
Provided this level is complied with, then health will be safe-guarded with an appropriate
margin of safety (namely a factor of 100). All other suggested criteria in this report are
to protect against nuisance impacts and therefore should have some flexibility in their
application.
Areas where non-KPC workers are located (for example Oserian Development Company
work force) should be assessed on the 60-minute Californian Standard of 0.03 ppm (0.042
mg/M3) and residential areas should be considered affected if 30-minute concentrations
are above 0.0046 ppm (7 ug/m3). It is proposed, that in this regard, residential areas
housing KPC workers be treated in the same way as other residential areas.
It is also proposed that areas supporting commercially, culturally or scientifically important
vegetation should not be permitted to experience exposures above 0.03 ppm 10.042
mg/mr3) long-term average. These criteria are intended to protect all elements of the
environment from the adverse effects of hydrogen sulphide and when used with the
dispersion modelling study, results will define what level of effect may be expected in
particular areas.
The protection of workers within the power station is beyond the scope of an
Environmental Assessment, but it is suggested that the United States TLVs for work-place
exposure, namely 10 ppm (15 mg/m3) 8-hour average, be used for this purpose.

6.6.7. Existing Air Quality
6.6.7.1 Monitoring Program
Measurements of air quality have been made to determine existing concentrations of
hydrogen sulphide in areas close to the existing power station. The approach has been to
attempt to determine the highest short-term concentrations that occur from the existing
power station. Measurements were made with a Kitagawa Model AP-1 gas detector tube
system. Tlhis system measures hydrogen sulphide using an aspirating pump to draw 100
ml of air through a specially prepared reagent, which changes colour (is stained) as the
hydrogen sulphide in sampled air is drawn through the reagent. The concentration of
hydrogen sulphide is proportional to the length of the stained reagent. The gas samples
are taken manually and the measured concentrations relate to a 1 -minute averaging period.
The sensitivity of the measurement device is approximately 0.05 ppm (0.07 mg/m3).
In most cases the procedure adopted for the study was to wait until ground-level
concentrations appeared to be at a maximum as determined by the intensity of hydrogen
sulphide odour. The point of likely maximum impact was determined by visual observation
of the plume from the gas ejectors on the existing power station and from the cooling
tower. In two cases, measurements were made in the steam from Well 709 which was
under test at the time and discharging directly to the atmosphere.
Measurements were made over the period 7 May to 27 May 1991 and 18 November to
27 December 1991 . The locations of the measurement sites and are shown on Figure
6.6.1. The results are discussed in Section 6.6.7.2.
6-46



6.6.7.2 Existing Air Quality
Results of the monitoring program are presented in Table 6.6.4, which shows the times,
locations, wind speed, wind direction and concentration of each measurement.
The data in Table 6.6.4 relate to 1-minute average concentrations, and while higher
concentrations would undoubtedly be measured if more data were to be collected, they
are representative of the higher concentrations that occur in the vicinity of the existing
power station.
It should be noted that the concentrations measured over a 1-minute interval should not
be compared directly with the ambient air quality goals listed in Table 6.6.3 which refer
to longer averaging times. Concentrations over longer averaging periods, such as the 30
minutes, 60 minutes and 24 hour periods will be lower than over 1-minute. Using basic
dispersion theory it can be estimated that 30-minute averages would be approximately 50
percent of the 1-minute values, 60-minute averages would be 44 percent and 24-hour
averages would be still lower. Site specific factors which determine the distribution of
winds prevent any reliable quantitative estimate from being provided for periods of 24
hours or greater.  The data show  that in the raw  gas (and condensing steam)
approximately 10 m from a well, the hydrogen sulphide concentrations can be just above
safe limits. (See for example the data from Site C where 1-minute average concentrations
of 0.1 5 ppm (0.23 mg/m3) were measured, compared with the WHO 24-hour guideline
value of 0.10 ppm (0.1 5 mg/mr3). This is not to say that all wells would be the same, and
it should also be recognised that subsequent processing of the steam results in a
concentration of the non-condensable hydrogen sulphide to levels that would certainly be
harmful if not managed properly. Thus it is relevant to note that concentrations of
hydrogen sulphide from the power station emissions will often be higher than the
concentration of hydrogen sulphide in the raw steam plumes associated with wells under
test. In other words concentrations in these steam plumes will not necessarily be the
highest concentrations in the area as is evident from the data in Table 6.6.4.
The monitoring data indicate that air quality close (within a few hundred metres) to the
existing power station complies with the WHO 24-hour guideline values and certainly,
beyond the fenced areas, hydrogen sulphide concentrations would be expected to be
within the guidelines for the protection of health.

6.6.8 Emissions of Radioactive Gases
The issue addressed in this section is whether radon, which will form a very small fraction
of the non-condensable geothermal emissions from the power station, could pose a health
risk.
Radon is a radioactive noble gas that occurs in several isotopic forms, only two of which
occur in significant concentrations in the general environment. One form, radon-222 is a
member of the decay chain of uranium-238 and the other, radon-232 occurs in the decay
of thorium-232. Because uranium occurs widely throughout the earth's crust, radon is
also present in small quantities in the atmosphere. The average level at the earth's surface
is estimated to be 3 Bqlm3, with a range of 0.1, over the oceans, to 10 Bq/m3 (WHO
1987). (Note one Becquerel (1 Bq) is the unit of activity of radioactive substances and is
equivalent to one radioactive decay per second).
Clarke et al. (1 990) present a diagram showing the complete decay chain and the half lives
of all the daughter products (decay products) involved. In summary radon gas decays, by
losing an alpha particle (two protons and two neutrons), to polonium-218. The half life
of the decay is 3.83 days. Further decays take place until the final prcduct lead-206 is
reached. Lead-206 is a radioactively stable isotope.
Apart from exposure of workers in uranium mines, most of the current concern with radon
is with indoor exposures in poorly ventilated buildings, where radon emanations from
mineral-based building materials and from soil and rocks can cause radon levels to reach
levels of concern. Because of the mild climatic conditions in the Olkaria area, ventilation
of housing is unlikely to allow a build-up of radon in residences.
Radon gas itself does not pose a particularly serious threat to human or animal health
because it is breathed in and out and is not retained by the body. However, the decay
products (referred to as radon daughters) can lodge within the lung and air pathways and
cause adverse health effects. The WHO (1987) suggests that the radon daughter
concentration that would be in effective equilibrium with 3 Bq/m3 of radon gas, will be of
the order of 1-1.5 Bq/m3 equilibrium equivalent radon (EER) concentration. Because of
various removal mechanisms for the decay products, equilibrium does not always apply
and an equilibrium factor F has to be applied. Values of F reported for residential buildings
in different areas are in the range 0.3-0.5.
Models have been developed which relate the radon concentration in the air to the
radiation dose that will be received by a particular individual. WHO (1987) sets the
following guideline for buildings; (1) remedial action should be considered in buildings
where radon daughter concentrations are higher than 400 Bq/m3 EER annual average and
(2) building codes should include sections designed to ensure that radon daughter levels
do not exceed 100 Bq/m3 EER in new buildings.
Clarke et al. (1990) present the results of a field survey of radon-222. Part of the survey
included measurements of radon-222:carbon dioxide ratios in fumaroles in the Olkaria
geothermal area. The data presented are relative measurements of activity and percentage
carbon dioxide expressed as counts per minute for particular values of concentration of
carbon dioxide expressed as a percentage of the fumarole gas. Data on the absolute level
of activity in Bq/m3 are not available. They can however be approximately estimated by
assuming that the volume of the enamometer (the device which is used to measure the
radioactivity) is 250 ml. If this is the case and the efficiency of the counting system is
100 per cent then data reported by Clarke et al. (1990) can be used to provide an
6-51



indication of the radon-222 levels in the emitted fumarole gas and of the resulting ground-
level levels of radon-222 (expressed in BqIm3). The data presented in Table 5.1 of Clarke
et al. (1990) shows that the radon-222 levels in the Olkaria area (including the domes and
Hell's Gate area) were in the range 255 to 3000 counts per minute. The level of the
maximum (3000) was in fact off the scale of the measuring device so the reading would
have been higher than this, by an unknown margin. If it is assumed that the maximum
level would have been 5000 cpm and the volume of the enamometer chamber was 250
ml and its efficiency was 100 per cent, then the activity of the fumarole gas would be
3.3x105 Bq/m3. Radon-222 levels were found to be strongly correlated with carbon
dioxide concentrations and the carbon dioxide concentration that corresponded to the
maximum radon-222 level, was 30.6 percent.
The potential impacts of radon released as a result of the North East Olkaria development
will be discussed in Section 7.4.
6.7 NOISE
The potential for a noise to annoy depends on the loudness of the noise relative to the
existing noise levels. Thus to undertake an impact assessment it is necessary to determine
the existing noise environment in the absence of noise emissions from the project. In
addition it is necessary to obtain information about the noise emission levels from the
project during its various phases. This section describes the studies and presents the
results of noise level measurements that have been made. The use of these data in noise
impact assessment for impact assessment is presented in Section 7.5.
The relative remoteness of the project from non-KPC controlled residential areas ensures
that no serious noise impacts are occurring during the present well testing program,
although some temporary impacts on the noise environment has occurred at the X2-Camp.
These impacts are now declining, but will continue until the well testing phase has been
completed. There will also be some noise impacts at X2-Camp from the operating power
station, if X2-Camp were to remain in its present location.
6.7.1 Noise Measurement and Background Noise Monitoring Program
Data on background noise levels are important from the point of view of noise impact
assessment because it is the difference between the background noise and the project
related noise that most closely correlates with the perceived annoyance of a noise.
Unfortunately, because of the well testing program it has not been possible to determine
pre-project background noise levels. To obtain these data it has been necessary to
undertake a noise monitoring study at a remote location not affected by noise emissions
under test. The selected monitoring site was on the northern side of Olkaria Hill.
Background noise levels were determined using a Bruel and Kjaer (Type 2214) noise level
meter and a microprocessor controlled data logger, which sampled and recorded the noise
level at one-second intervals over a 24-hour period.
6.7.2 Background Noise Levels
The noise ievels measured are summarised for each hour of the 24-hour monitoring period
in Table 6.7.1. The readings taken were the LA10 LA50, LA90, LA99 and LAmin. The "A'
in the reading signifies that the measurement is A-weighted, which means that the sound
level reading has been adjusted, according to its tonal composition, so that the level
6-52



represents the loudness that would be perceived by the "standard" human ear. The
subscripts 10, 50, 90 and so on indicate percentile levels, so that the LA90 is the sound
level exceeded for 90 per cent of the measurement period. In the Table 6.7.1 all
measurement periods were one hour.
For assessment purposes the LA3C level is particularly relevant because it represents the
noise levels at the site under the quieter periods that occur at the site. It is often referred
to as the background noise level. For this site the LA9O levels ranged from 24 to 34 dB(A).
A background noise level of 24 dB(A) represents extremely quiet conditions. In the
absence of wells under test it can be considered that background noise levels in the
vicinity of the proposed power station will be low. They may not be as low as those
recorded at Olkaria Hill because the power station site is closer to existing noise sources
such as the existing power station, the Oserian flower farm and X2-Camp. These areas
and associated transportation activities would cause noise levels to be higher than those
at Olkaria Hill.

6.7.3 Measurements of Noise Emission Sources
Measurements of noise emission levels from various items of plant on the existing Olkaria
power station have been made. This information will be used with a noise prediction

6.8 LAKE NAIVASHA
The key reason for the concern and inclusion of Lake Naivasha in this EA is the proposition
that existing and proposed geothermal developments may affect lake levels through both
direct ancJ indirect water abstraction. This would be a matter of serious concern if lake
levels were being or were likely to be significantly affected by geothermal development.
This section provides a review of the lake and its regional setting and reviews data
available to quantify as far as is possible the effect of geothermal development on the lake.
After a general introduction and basic description of the hydrology of the lake (Section
6.8.2), the discussion considers the direct effect which involves pumping water from the
lake for uses such as drilling wells, current power station operation, and for domestic use
in housing estates (Section 6.8.3). The potential indirect effect refers to a possible
"hydraulic-link" from the lake to the geothermal field. The possibility of such a link is
discussed (Section 6.8.4), using data and literature on the hydrology of the lake.
Considerable work has already been done and described in recent studies completed by
the British Geological Survey (Clarke et a., 1990). However, it is important to emphasise
that it is beyond the scope of this study to fully resolve the issue. A separate
5 These measurements were made under neutral atmospheric condition with approximately 7i8 cloud
cover and liight winds in the range 0 to 3 m.s'l.
6-54



commissioned study is needed specifically investigating the subsurface outflow from the
lake and the "hydraulic-link issue. The Consultants believe from discussions with KPC
that such a detailed study is planned in conjunction with further exploration/development
activity (Wasunna, personal communication, 1991). However, it is possible to show that
even if a direct connection exists the effect of East and North East Olkaria geothermal
developments based on reinjection would not be expected to significantly perturb the lake
water balance.
Another factor, considered in the discussion of water abstraction is the current and
proposed development of dams on the Malewa River; the major river which feeds into Lake
Naivasha (Section 6.8.3).
Excessive water abstraction could have a direct impact on the commercial fishery of the
lake, and the important habitats associated with the fishery. As a result, a review of the
important aspects of the fishery was undertaken, including the distribution of aquatic
vegetation, and potential spawning and fish nursery areas (Sections 6.8.5 and 6). Data
on the yearly catch were also collected and discussed. This information is provided to
establish the importance of the lake as a regional resource and to highlight the need for
further studies to obtain basic data that will allow the lake to be managed in a sustainable
manner.
6.8.1 Introduction
Lake Naivasha, a shallow freshwater lake at an altitude of 1 890 metres, is the highest of
the Rift Valley lakes. The lake lies some 80 km south of the equator and 1 00 km north-
west of Nairobi. The name Naivasha comes from the Maasai "e-naiposha", meaning
approximately "that which is heaving, that which flows to and fro". The lake has always
been an important ecological site to Kenya, because of the diversity of flora and fauna in
the range of vegetation-zones associated with the lake and the hinterland, which is greater
than that of other Rift Valley lakes (Lincer et al., 1981). This importance has been
maintained even though the lake has no statutory protection or reserve status.
The area around Lake Naivasha also has high economic value. Cattle-watering by Maasai
in former times has given way, during the present century, to settled agriculture - including
the-raising of export cash-crops around its shores. However this agriculture is heavily
dependent upon lake water for irrigation.
Naivasha town is a centre for both the lake-shore farms and the ranches and small
holdings of the adjacent Kinangop Plateau. A commercial fishery has been built up over
the past 30 years on the basis of introduced species, the products being exported to
Nairobi and Nakuru in addition to local consumption.
Lake Naivasha is also a focus for tourism and recreation, which have grown since the first
sport-fishing began in the late 1920s. Its catchment streams provide the main water-
supplies for both Naivasha and Nakuru towns. More recently, the area has become
industrially significant as a consequence of the development of the existing Olkaria
geothermal development.
Two official government bodies have direct control over some aspects of Lake Naivasha.
The Department of Fisheries manages the fishery by the issue of licences and enforcement
of mesh-size regulations. The Ministry of Water Development issues licences for the
6-55



abstraction of water for irrigation. Several other bodies have interests in the lake - the
local government agencies at Provincial, District, and Town Council, levels; national bodies
such as the President's Commission on Soil Conservation and Afforestation, and local
bodies such as the Lake Naivasha Riparian Owners' Association, are the main ones. The
KWS now has increasing local interest as two areas adjacent to the lake - Longonot
Volcano and Hell's Gate - were declared National Parks in the mid 1 980s. KPC has a
direct and long standing interest in the lake. This is because the lake provides the most
economical source of water for not only drilling activity and current power station
operation but also for domestic requirements in their housing estates.
6.8.2 Hydrology
The Naivasha catchment is separated from the Nakuru-Elementeita catchment mainly by
the Eburru volcanic pile which is linked to the Mau Escarpment by a ridge at an altitude of
around 2600 m (Figure 6.8.1). Between Eburru and the Bahati Escarpment the surface
drainage divide runs via Gilgil along a culmination of the Rift floor at an altitude of
approximately 2000 m.
South-east of the drainage divide the perennial Gilgil and Malewa Rivers provide much of
the recharcge to Lake Naivasha. The Gilgil River has its headwaters high in the Bahati
Forest and drains parts of the eastern slopes of the Bahati Escarpment (drainage area 420
km2). These slopes also provide some of the tributaries of the much larger Malewa River
(drainage area 1,730 km2). Most of the discharge of the Malewa River, however, at least
in its upper reaches, derives from the western slopes of the high Nyandarua Range
(formerly called the Aberdares). Further downstream the Malewa is joined by the Turasha
River which is also perennial and drains the north Kinangop Plateau via deeply incised

On the west side of the Naivasha catchment, thie main river draining the Mau Escarpment
is the Marmonet, which flows towards the lake but fails to reach it, instead recharging the
alluvium of the Ndabibi Plain. Similarly none of the numerous streams which incise the
Eburru Ridge reaches Lake Naivasha.
To the south of Lake Naivasha, the surface water divide runs from the Mau Escarpment
in the west via Mounts Olkaria and Longonot to the Kinangop Plateau and finally to the
Nyandarua Mountains. Surface drainage in this region, at least at lower altitudes, is
limited, only the River Karati providing perennial flow in its upper reaches, and cutting a
deep gully as it descends the steep platforms east of Naivasha town.
A combination of intrarift faulting and the occurrence of recent volcanic activity has
resulted in localised drainage basin development. A number of these basins are the site
of present day Rift Valley lakes most of which show clear indications of being much larger
in the past.
The relatively recent volcanic activity has left four depressions in Lake Naivasha, three of
which are at least partly connected (Figure 6.8.2). The largest water area, the main Lake
(approximately 1 50 km2) is shallow, deepening towards its southwestern end to a
maximum of 8 m (at 1983 water-levels). At the eastern side of the main Lake is a partially-
submerged crater of which the highest rim section forms Crescent Island and of which the
basin is the deepest part of the lake (18 m deep at 1983 water-levels). At low water-
levels this partially-submerged crater is separated from the main Lake and becomes
chemically distinct. A much smaller, more alkaline lake, Oloidien (5.5 km2 in area), is
adjacent to Lake Naivasha to the west of its southern end, separated by papyrus swamp
but connected by an open-water channel at times of high water-levels. Within 3 km of the
western shore of Oloidien Lake, lies an isolated, highly alkaline, crater lake - Sonachi - with
an area of about 0.2 km2 and maximum depth of about 4 m (in 1983).
Lake Water-level Variations
Recordings of the water level have been made at three different places around the lake.
The details of these gauging locations, correction for datum height and discussion on the
collation and presentation of the water level variations (shown in Figure 6.8.3) are given
in Ase (1987). For the construction of the part of the graph that covers 1880 - 1908 the
data are Lincertain and consequently are shown with a broken line (Figure 6.8.3).
The range of water levels during the past century can be seen to span 1 5 m (Figure 6.8.3).
There are several periods of rapid rise or fall as well as a particularly protracted period of
decline from the 1 920s to 1950s. After the heavy "long rains" in 1 977, the water level
rose until imid 1979 by approximately 3 m. After some decline a new peak occurred after
the heavy rains in April-May 1981. Since early 1984 the level has been falling steadily,
and in January 1988, it was 5 m below the 1983 peak and was in fact at its lowest level
this century. The onset of the long rains in April 1988, brought an end to this decline, at
least for the time being.
Ase et al., (1986) concluded that the water balance of Lake Naivasha had a rather unstable
equilibrium, and that river inflow just below the average makes the lake level drop
considerably. On the other hand, lake level can be shown to be sensitive to high inflow
lake level rose by over a metre in only a month in May 1977.

HISTORICAL LAKE LEVELS



The monthly variations in lake level were studied by Ase (1987) for the period 1911 to
1 980. The data were presented as mean monthly levels (without confidence limits) and
showed a general seasonal pattern of lowest lake levels around the beginning of the year
(dry season) followed by a rise during the long rains in April-May.  However, the
characteristic dry period during the middle of the year (June-July) is not evident, and
average levels continue to rise until September and subsequently decline.  Such
independence of rainfall was interpreted as being supportive evidence for the significant
influence of groundwater flow.
To date, the studies on lake-level fluctuations have not been found to show any direct
relationship with local rainfall (Harper et al., 1990), except that periods of exceptionally
high rainfall are followed by lake-level rises (e.g. in 1922, 1930, and 1961-63) > Annual
evaporation always exceeds rainfall (Ase et al., 1986). In a statistical analysis, however,
Vincent et al., (1979) suggested that the lake's level is an indicator of the long-term
pattern of high altitude climate - particularly the penetration of equatorial westerlies and
their influence on land above 2500 m asl. Evidence for this hypothesis came from the
correlation of monthly lake-level changes with precipitation data from high-altitude
meteorological stations (at 2700 m), and the correlation of lake-level with the altitude of
the snout of the Lewis Glacier on Mt Kenya. Long-term fluctuations showed close
similarities with those of Lake Turkana, which also has a mountainous catchment and no
surface outlet - compared to no similarities with the fluctuations in Lake Victoria.
6.8.3       The Water Balance of Lake Naivasha
Past Studies
Several water balances fcr the lake have been described. Three studies based on river
gauging and evaporation-rate measurement, have given comparable results for subsurface
outflow of 43 x 1 O6 m3/y (Sikes, 1936). 34 x 1 o6 m3/y (McCann, 1972) and 46-56 x 1 6
mi3/y (Ase et al., 1986). These are likely to be underestimates, as not all inflows could be
gauged, but suggest that substantial outflow is occurring. The direction of this outflow
and possible connection with the Olkaria geothermal field is discussed in (Section 6.8.4)
The extensive study by Ase et al. (1986) compared the observed with calculated changes
in monthly lake-levels (AS). The calculations were done for two periods (January 1972
to December 1974; January 1978 to December 1980) based on the following equation:
AS = P + R - E
Where,
AS = monthly calculated water level change,
P = average precipitation on the lake,
E = potential evaporation, and
R = rest (other losses).
The calculated lake levels were systematically greater than the observed. For the period
1972-4 this amounted to a lake level increment of 23 mm/month while, for the period from
1978-80, it was 28 mm.month and an overall average of 25 mm/month. This when
6-60



expressed in m3/y gives tne range 46-56 x 106 m3,y or an average of 50 x 106 m3/y.
Ase et al., (1986) concluded that the most probable explanation was that of a subsurface
outflow.
In a subsequent paper Ase (1987) presents a water balance for the entire period from
1936 to 1976 (Table 6.8.1) based on the following factors:
Ln  L + P +  i - E - ET    S
Where;
L     a previous water level,
P =  precipitation (between L and Ln)b
I=   surface inflow to the lake in the same time,
E =  evaporation from the lake surface,
ET =  evapotranspiration, and
S =  normally storage, but in this case it should equal the difference between the
assumed underground inflow and outflow.
The precipitation (P) and evaporation lE) figures have been obtained from Naivasha D. C.
and the figures for surface inflow (I) have been taken from the Malewa and Gilgil Rivers.
The results support the theory of an underground outlet, as there is a considerable rest
sum (S) that could not be attributed to errors associated with the parameters used in the
calculations.

There are, however, two factors omitted from Table 6.8.1; namely water abstraction for
irrigation and evapotranspiration (ET). The first factor is unlikely to have been an important
influence on the water budget given that it was for the period 1936 to 1976 and only
relatively small areas were under irrigation. This is no longer the case and the specific
issue of water abstraction is discussed in Section 6.8.3.
6-61



The second omission, -nat of evapotranspiration, is more serious in terms of the
calculaticns presented tL Ase et al., (1986). The lake was assumed to have a surface
totally free of vegetation, which is known not to have been the case. The realisation of
this led to a subsequent oublication by Ase (1987) in which Cvyerus [Davrus is reported
to have covered 10 per cent of the surface of the lake during the period 1936 to 1976.
Another aquatic plant, Salvinia molesta, occurred during only a small part of the period
(see Section 6.8.6) and i-s influence on the water budget much less than that of CvDerus
Dagyrus and was therefore not taken into account. This is certainly not true of more
recent times, for example in 1 983 Salvinia molesta is reported to have covered 20 per cent
of the lake surface (Njuguna, 1983).
The study by Ase (1987) showed that transpiration was up to three times that of
evaporation from a free water surface (note; this result differs markedly from that of
Penman (19631, who is widely regarded as an authority on the subject). Nevertheless,
such a rate would resu.: in a change of evaporation in Table 6.8.1 from 67.94 m to
approximately 85 m.  This in turn would change the rest factor from  48 m to
approximately 31 m. In -he same study Ase (1987) also questioned if the pan factor for
evaporation was realistic because of the notable influence of wind. When the pan factor
was "converted" to take account of wind conditions experienced by the lake a further third
of the rest factor disapFeared. Consequently, as a result of the relatively small amount
remaining, Ase (1987) ended by questioning the existence of any significant subsurface
outflow from the lake.
While such statements contrast with the conclusions arrived at previously by the same
author that there was a -.ett outflow of approximately 50 x 1 O6 m3/y (Ase et al., 1986),
the evidence for evapotranspiration rate and pan factor conversion is very limited. Also,
if the outflow is insigni-.cant then the lake's relatively low salinity despite substantial
evaporation is unexplained - a factor not considered by Ase (1987).
Current Study
There is an obvious neec from the above discussion, for a detailed water balance of Lake
Naivasha, the scope of :;hich is beyond the resources of this EA. The evapotranspiration
issue alone requires ex,c rimentation and detailed monitoring for at least a year not only
for Cyoerus oapyrus bu: also for the periodically extensive Saivinia molesta. Also, and
perhaps more important y, most monitoring of the lake ceased in 1988. Specifically, the
Ministry of Water & Development stopped measuring the Maiewa and Gilgil Rivers as well
as lake levels in early 1 288. Rainfall and evaporation data are available but there is no
means of dietermining river flows since 1988. Consequently, for a "new" water balance
to be determined, either it is necessary to re-initiate monitoring and collect data for at least
a year, or it can only be :alculated up to 1987. The latter option would have the problem
of determining accurate abstraction rates because of missing records.
The approach taken in -nis study has been to present a modified balance based on the
work by Ase et al. (19861 but taking into account recent abstraction levels. The important
aspect to remember for this EA is the extent and magnitude of influence the proposed
North East Olkaria dev-.opment would have on Lake Naivasha. As mentioned in the
introduction (Section 6.8.1), this relates to direct and indirect water abstraction. Direct
abstraction is discussed below and indirect in the next section (Section 6.8.4). Thus for
the EA there is no critical need for a water balance, only an investigation of the relative
role played by the propcsed geothermal development.

Water Abstraction Rates
The Water Bailiff of the Ministry of Water and Development issues licences for the
abstraction of water from Lake Naivasha. Currently there are 1 08 registered direct water
abstractions from the lake for a total of 83 340 m3/day or 30.4 x 1 o6 m3/y. This figure
represents 60 per cent of the estimated water storage (S) or outflow from the lake. This
demonstrates that current water abstraction has a significant influence on the water
balance. To what extent the abstracted water is "redirected" outflow, rather than
additional to the normal outflow, is unknown. There is also the unknown proportion of
irrigation water which recirculates within the catchment area rather than being "lost"
through evaporation.  The extremely permeable surface formations means that the
probable rate of soakage is high compared with evaporation and therefore a large amount
of irrigation water could be recirculated.
Table 6.8.2 lists the top-ten licensed water abstractors and shows that KPC is registered
for 2622.56 m31day or 3.1 per cent of the total. This amount covers water taken from
three intakes; one for Eburru, another for Olkaria and North East Olkaria, and the final
smaller intake for the housing estate. The table also shows that KPC is only the eighth
largest abstractor. The two largest abstractors account for virtually a third of the total on
their own, compared to KPC's 3.1 per cent. Another important point is that the amount
of water used by KPC will substantially diminish once drilling is completed. This is in
contrast to other water abstractors who primarily use the water for irrigation and are more
likely in the long-term to want to increase their usage6. Therefore, in terms of possible
impact on the lake level because of water abstraction, it can be shown that KPC would not
be a primary cause.
As an independent measure of lake water usage, an alternative approach was adopted in
which the 1990 consumption of electrical power (kWh) for pumping was gathered. KPLC
has a specific tariff rate for water pump installations used for irrigation and their Nakuru
had records of whether the water pumps were for bore-holes or pumping from the lake.
From their records a list of 224 pumps was obtained. Of these, those using a commercial
quantity of power (ie biggest users; greater than 7000 kWh/month) were selected (42
users) and their annual total of power consumption determined. A pump efficiency of 65
per cent was used and a 40 m head since virtually all the water is used for local irrigation.
The specific parameters used for the KPC pumped water differed since they pump to a
significantly greater head and use the water differently. The following general equation
was used to convert the annual electric energy used for pumping (kWh) to volume of water
abstracted (m3/y).
Q = (E x W)/(H x G)                                  (6.3)
Where,
Q  = flow rate (kg/s), and
W  = electrical power (W),
H  = the pressure head (40 m),
G  = gravitational acceleration (9.81 mIs2),
E = pump efficiency (65 per cent).
B Note: until recently the large irrigators have used spray irrigation systems in which approximately 70 per
cent of the water is lost by evaporation, In recent times there has been a trend to use drip irrigation, which
uses only one third as much water for the same area of crop. Thus although areas under irrigation may expand
the amount of water used could, in the short-term. fall.

The estimate for the pumping rate in kilograms of water per second was then turned into
an annual volume by multiplying by the number of seconds in a year and assuming that
the density of water is 1 000 kg/m3.
The estimated quantity of water pumped from Lake Naivasha in 1 990 and the top-ten
users are listed in Table 6.8.3. The total is conservative since the numerous small-scale
users were not included. The results show that abstraction estimates based on power
consumption are almost twice that of the licenced amounts presented in Table 6.8.2. A
total of approximately 59 x 106 m3/y was abstracted for irrigation which is as least as
great as the estimated annual outflow of Ase et al., (1986). However, as mentioned
earlier, the amount abstracted for irrigation does not necessarily mean that the water is
removed from the catchment and a proportion may recirculate.
The intention of the study was to accurately determine the role and significance of direct
water abstraction by KPC and not that of the Ministry of Water and Development.
Although the actual amount abstracted by KPC was more than its licence, the significant
point is the company's tenth ranking (Table 6.8.3). As such, in terms of concern about
influencing lake levels, the abstracted amount by KPC was 3 per cent of the total and
substantially less than nine other companies. The study does not answer the question of
whether or not abstraction does influence Jake levels, but if this is the case, then KPC is
not the major cause, only a contributor. There are two other points that should be
considered. Water abstraction by KPC is fairly constant throughout the year, so water is
taken from both periods of lake level increase and decrease.  Most irrigation occurs
seasonally (during dry periods) and this only accentuates lowering lake levels. The second
point is that most of the water being currently abstracted is for drilling. Most of the wells
will be completed by mid-1992 which will greatly reduce the water requirements.
However it is likely that further (exploratory) drilling will continue, though the specific
concerns for this assessment are only the proposed North East Olkaria development.
Malewa Dam Development
The Malewa Dam Project plans to transfer water from the Malewa River to the Greater
Nakuru Municipal area. The Malewa River is the largest river discharging into Lake
Naivasha and contributes 95 per cent of the inflow. The project aims to satisfy the long
term potable water requirements for the townships of Nakuru, Gilgil and Naivasha, and
surrounding rural areas in central Rift Valley Province which have experienced very rapid
population growth in recent years. The project consists of two phases:
Phase 1:     Produce 18 000 m3/day (6.57 x 106 m3/y) from the Turasha river, 13 300
m31day to Nakuru city and 4 700 m3/day to Gilgil. The dam is built and the
pipeline is currently under construction.
Phase II:    Two stages of development, each contributing 47 000 m3/day (17.1 6 x 1 06
m3/y) giving a final total supply of 113 600 m3/day (41.46 x 1o6 m3/y).
The proposal consists of a 80 m high dam on the Malewa River and an inter-
basin transfer tunnel from the dam to an intake structure on the Turasha
River. Water will be abstracted from the Turasha and fed by pipeline to the
water treatment works sited near Gilgil and from there distributed.
7 Note: conservative in this context means the estimate will be too low, which has been taken to be
conservative because it will result in an overestimate of KPC's abstraction as a fraction of tne total.
6-65



A brief impact study has been conducted by Nippon Koei Co Ltd who are acting as
consultants to the National Water and Pipeline Development Corporation. The second
phase of cievelopment has been halted pending the findings of a full environmental study.
The study is firstly to address the problem of disposal of the effluent water at Nakuru so
that it does not all flow into Lake Nakuru with potentially serious ecological consequences.
The second part will investigate the ability of Lake Naivasha to sustain such abstraction
levels.
The latter is relevant to the Olkaria geothermal project. Given that the current abstraction
from the lake for irrigation already equals or slightly exceeds the outflow from the lake,
further abstraction of the magnitude proposed may not be sustainable, and a fall in lake
level would seem likely. Even the first dam represents the second greatest source of
water abstraction from the lake and as such its impact is much greater than that of KPC.
6.8.4 Hydrogeology
As mentioned in the introduction (Section 6.8.1), the floor of the rift valley has its highest
elevation in the area of Lake Naivasha, generally falling both to the north and south. There
is therefore a potential hydraulic gradient within the Rift in these axial directions, The
often steelp and markedly elevated boundary escarpments, however, develop the greatest
head and lateral flow into the Rift from these highland areas must be extremely important.
These highlands support well developed tropical rainforest, e.g. the Aberdares, Mau and
Kikuyu escarpments, indicating that local recharge must be higher than in the Rift where
the vegetation is of a semiarid character. Meteorological records confirm this difference -
the escarpments having an annual rainfall of 1200-1500 mm with similar to lower
evapotranspiration rates while the lower rainfall within the Rift (430 mm at Magadi, 980
mm at Nakuru, 627 mm at Naivasha), is accompanied by potential transpiration rates often
many times the rainfall.
The high evaporation/precipitation ratio prevailing in the floor of the Rift, combined with
the closed nature of the basins, results in the lakes being of generally brackish to saline
character. An exception is Lake Naivasha, which is the freshest of the lakes. Its low
salinity gives it high ecological and economic values. The low salinity is due in part to the
large catchiment area in the Nyandarua Mountain range and in part to outflow processes.
Initially there was assumed to be some undiscovered subterranean outlet (Gregory, 1921)
together with very dilute inflows (Worthington, 1932). This view was refined, however,
by Gaude: & Meiak (1981), and Ase (1987), who showed that the lake was,
hydrologically, a seepage lake. They concluded that the lake remained fresh - partly
because of its dilute inflows and seepage losses but additionally because of biochemical
and geochemical sedimentation removing certain ions such as sulphates and carbonates.
The opposite case is exemplified by Lake Magadi which has no outlet, is fed on all sides
by springs which are themselves saline and much of whose surface is covered with a thick
trona (salt) deposit which forms the basis of an important chemical industry.
The Naivasha catchment is in a hydrogeologically complex environment. Borehole record
examinations by Clarke et al. (1990) showed that the piezometric surface generally follows
the surface contours, i.e. underground movement of water is occurring both axially along
the Rift (discharge), and iaterally from the bounding highlands into the Rift (recharge). The
data support discharge flow both north and south from Naivasha, with a steeper fall to the
south. The geothermal field at Olkaria lies at the southern and northern edges of the
Naivasha catchment ard the recharge of these fields is therefore connected with
6-66



subsurface flows within, or more precisely out of the catchment.  However, the
geothermal systems are not over-pressurised. This is illustrated by the lack of surface
springs and the depth of the hot water below the surface. Such a situation could result
from the axial permeability along the Rift faults being an order of magnitude greater tharn
the lateral permeability.
Attempts to quantify grcundwater flows in the Naivasha catchment comprised two types;
water balance studies, and applications of Darcy's Law of groundwater flow on a regional
scale. Both have tended to consider the Naivasha catchment to be a "cold" watershed and
to follow classical cold water hydrology. In fact the catchment occurs in an active
geothermal system and therefore conditions existing in a hot environment must determine
the behaviour of the fluids. There is an increasing amount of evidence becoming available
(T. Mahon pers. com.) to suggest that the various perched water tables in the catchment,
particularly to the south, are intimately connected and this has been shown to be true in
most active geothermal systems. A re-evaluation of lake level variations based on a "hot"
catchment may shov, that the changes can be attributed to deeper water
temperature/density oscillations and not volumes.
Based on past water balance studies, (reviewed in Section 6.8.3), preliminary estimates
of subsurface flows frorn the Naivasha catchment, suggest that the amount contributed
by Lake Naivasha is arcund 50 x 1 o6 m3/y (which is 20 per cent of the total recharge
estimated by a previous water balance study). Flow to the south via relatively shallow
aquifers (i.e. at depths at less than about 500 m) may be the most significant route for
water flow from the cat:hment. accounting for perhaps 50 per cent to 90 per cent of the
total (Clarke et al., 1990).
Estimates of the scale ef the regional flow out of the Naivasha catchment have been
attempted by Clarke et al. (1990) with certain assumptions concerning regional head
gradients and permeabiiries. In their calculations a north-south groundwater gradient of
0.1 m/m was used, a hydraulic conductivity of 3 x 10-3 m/d (across the Rift; 25 km), and
flow assumed to occur .o a depth of 5 km. This resulted in the estimated southerly flow
at depth from the Naivasha catchment to be 14 x 106 m3/y. On top of this must be
added the amount of southerly flow in shallow aquifers. This was estimated to be
between 27 x 105 m3/y and 270 x 106 m3/y. Although acknowledged by Clarke et al.
(1990) as a crude estimate based on rudimentary data, the above figures do indicate the
order of magnitude of scutherly flows from the Naivasha catchment and suggest that the
shallower aquifers may form a significant conduit for southerly flow.
McCann (1974) estimated a northerly flow of 39 x 106 m3/y from the Naivasha catchment
towards the Elementeita catchment. Data from the Clarke et al. (1990) study suggested
much lower transmissivity values and therefore a shallow northerly flow of only 1 1 x 1 06
m3/y. A deep northerly flow over the same cross-section was estimated as 0.3 x 100
m3/y.
The implication deducec by Clarke et al. (1990) was that much of the subsurface outflow
from the Naivasha catc6-ment is to the south, via Olkaria-Longonot towards Suswa and
eventually towards Macadi, although there is little evidence that such water ever reaches
Magadi in an identifiable form.
6-67



known value is the hydraulic conductivity of relatively shallow material between Longonot
and Suswa. If the higher value of the range given above is taken, then the total flow out
of the catchment is estimated to be around 295 x 106 m3/y - a figure which agrees
reasonably well with McCann's (1974) figure of 250 x I 06 m3/y - of which around 20 per
cent is lake recharge. Less than 5 per cent of this total would flow north, and of the
southerly flow, only 5 per cent would occur at depth.
If the lower estimate of hydraulic conductivity is taken, then the total estimated recharge
value is 52 x 1 o6 m3/y, virtually all of which could be lake recharge. Here northerly flow
would account for about 20 per cent of the flow from the catchment, and of the southerly
flow, around 25 per cent would be at significant depths.
Concern has been expressed about the possible effect of geothermal production on the
level of Lake Naivasha. According to Bodvarsson et al. (1987) the average well at Olkaria
produces about 6 kg/s of steam, equivalent to around 2.5 MWe. Therefore in order to
produce 45 MWe the present wellfield discharges approximately 100 kg/s of steam,
equivalent to a liquid discharge rate of approximately 3 x 10o6 m3/y. This is only a small
proportion of even the minimum estimated total natural southerly flow from the Naivasha
area (41 x 1 o6 m3/y). With the North East Olkaria (64 MWe) development, reinjection is
to be practised and there is also the proposal to reinject at the existing Olkaria field.
Assuming that this will occur, then consumption would stay at about 4 x 10o m3/y (J.
Koenig pers. comm.), or less than ten per cent of the minimum Lake Naivasha underflow
calculated for the region, or one to two per cent of the maximum estimated underflow.
The hydroqeological features of the Lake Naivasha area are; a poorly permeable unit
(aquiclude) underlying the lake and separating it from the geothermal field; and the dual
steam and hot-water zones of the Olkaria field. A secondary but significant feature, is the
series of shallow, perched, unconfined aquifers on top of the aquiclude, which are found
in numerous drill holes. The perched aquifers appear to be in direct hydraulic continuity
with Lake Naivasha.
There appears to be leakage through the aquiclude into the deeper geothermal system
(hydrologic continuity). Whether this is direct underflow from the lake, or comes indirectly
via the perched aquifers is unknown. The isotopic identification of Lake Naivasha water
in the geothiermal steam is explained by Allen et al., (1989) as downward leakage followed
by mixing with non-Naivasha water, and does not require direct pressure continuity
between the lake and the geothermal field. Evidence in support of this, is given in the
following paragraphs.
Pressure gradient profiles measured from wells of the Olkaria field show hydrostatic
gradients associated with several perched aquifers. Below the perched aquifers, the
pressure drops to nearly atmospheric, indicating no hydraulic continuity between the
geothermal reservoir and the overlying perched aquifers. Pressure then rises in the
aquiclude and becomes isobaric in the steam reservoir. Pressure then increases again at
approximately a hydrostatic gradient in the underlying hot-water zone.  If as this
generalised pressure profile indicates, there is no direct pressure connection between the
deep hot-water zone and the lake or the perched aquifers, lowering the pressure in the
steam or hot-water zone may not have any measurable effect on the lake, or the perched
aquifers. Indeed, data to date do not show any correlation. Therefore even if there is a
hydrologic continuity between Lake Naivasha and Olkaria, increasing the output at Olkaria
may not have any effect on the lake. The lowering of the perched aquifer levels could
6-68



have an effect on the lake, however, geothermal operations are not expected to affect
these perched aquifers because there is no production from them.
Based on isotopic data, it appears that the Olkaria reservoir water is a mixture of about 40
to 50 per cent lake water with 50 to 60 per cent groundwater, infiltrating from the
western Rift escarpment. The lake water is identified by its relatively heavy oxygen and
hydrogen isotopes (resulting from solar evaporation of ponded water) compared to the
relatively light water of meteoric origin occurring as groundwater from the Rift margin.
For this lake water to originate in modern Lake Naivasha, it is necessary to envisage a
system in which Lake Naivasha water percolates vertically downward for several
kilometres, becomes heated then returns to within a few hundred metres of the surface
as geothermal fluid only a few kilometres distant from its point of descent. Such a model
appears unrealistic in view of evidence from drilling of very poor vertical permeability in the
system.
An alternative explanation is that the Olkaria reservoir contains a high percentage of
evaporated lake water, but that this water originates not from present-day Lake Naivasha,
but from ancient lakes known to have formed and evaporated over the millennia of. Rift
valley history. These waters would have infiltrated the older Rift Valley sediments as the
valley subsided, wherein they became trapped as new sediments and volcanic flows
covered the old lake beds. The Olkaria wells have penetrated over 700 m of these old lake
sediments. Dr McNitt (pers. com.) believes it is more probable that the Olkaria geothermal
field consists of these "fossil" lake waters, rather than rapidly cycled, present-day Lake
Naivasha water.
6.8.5 Fishery Development and Sensitivity
Fish Introductions
At the end of the last century, there was little permanent settlement, but with the advent
of ranching and farming subsequent to the arrival of the railway, the population grew
steadily. The settlers looked to the lake to provide not only some food but also leisure
activity. Prior to 1925, there had only been a single species of fish in the lake - an
endemic zooplanktivorous small-tooth carp (Aolocheilichthves antinorii (Vinc .). It is
assumed that this paucity of species, highly unusual in a tropical freshwater lake, was due
to earlier periods of the lake drying out. The indigenous carp were very palatable but
offered no "sport" to fishermen.  In 1925 and 1926 the mouth-brooding cichlid
Oreochromis soilurus niaer (Dunther) was introduced by the colonial Kenya Game and
Fisheries Department. This fish flourished in the littoral fringe of the lake, and in 1 927 the
American large-mouthed bass (Microoterus salmoides Lacegede) was introduced to feed
on it and provide a basis of a sport-fishery. The introductions led to a dramatic increase
in the numbers of fish-eating birds such as fish eagles, pelicans, cormorants and herons.
Such was the increase that in 1937, some 750 cormorants were killed to preserve the
fish. Both fish species were successful until the low water-levels of the late 1 940s and
early 1950s, when they appeared to have died out (Harper et al., 1990).
Large-mouthed bass were re-introduced on several occasions between 1951 and 1956 -
in 1956, together with a second cichlid, the herbivorous Tilagia zillii (Gervais). The batch
of T. zillii unintentionally contained some individuals of Oreochromis leucostictus
(Trewavas). The latter unexpectedly flourished and is now the basis of the subsequent
commercial fishery. The Louisiana Red (Swamp) Crayfish (Procambarus clarkii (Girard))
6-69



was added in 1970 to broaden the range of the commercial fishery, and has been
harvested since 1 975 (Lowery & Mendes, 1 977). The most recent new arrival is the only
natural one - a small riverine fish Barbus amohicramma Blgr, which first migrated down to
the lake from the Malewa during the high water-levels of 1 982 (Harper, 1 984) and at
times since then, has been present in large enough quantities for limited commercial
exploitation at the Malewa inflow (Harper et al., 1990).
Several other fish species have been introduced over the past 50 years without any lasting
success.  Sporadic reports of Rainbow  Trout (Salmo aairdneri (L.)) derive from
introductions to the catchment streams for sport. Three cyprinodont species were
introduced for mosquito control - Gambusia sp., Poeciiia sp., and Lebistes reticulata Peters,
of which only the last named was found in 1982 (Harper, 1984). Oreochromis niloticus
Linnaeus was introduced in 1965 and was last found in 1969. Recently, however,
experimental netting during 1986 recorded this species in Oloidien Lake, and there are
unconfirmed reports from fishermen since then of its presence in the main Lake Naivasha
(Harper et al., 1990).
Other Introductions
In 1961 tthe first unintentional immigrant species, the floating water-fern Salvinia molesta
Mitch., was reported. It was known in ornamental ponds, and was available from
aquarists in Nairobi in the 1 950s (Harper et al.. 1990). Initially, Salvinia molesta was seen
as a great potential threat because of experiences with the Kariba reservoir on the
Zimbabwe/Zambia border and was sprayed with herbicide whenever discovered. However
it increased in area and by 1 973 had spread along the whole of the lake shoreline, but had
no measurable effect at that stage on the overall ecology of the lake. Recently research
into the possibility of releasing a weevil, Cyrtobagous salviniae Caldr & Sands, was
initiated in Kenya. After initial rejection by the Kenyan National Environment Secretariat
the weevil has been introduced but poor survival after quarantine has meant the impact
has been low and it is too early to tell what the outcome will be.
The original arrival of Salvinia molesta was closely followed by the Coypu (Mvocastor
covous (Molina)), which had been imported to the Kinangop Plateau for fur farming in
1950. Individuals escaped and arrived at Lake Naivasha from 1965 onwards (Harper,
1990) where by the early 1970s, there was a large population of Coypu. Biological
control methods were also tried with the introduction of pythons (Pvthon rebae), the
descendants of which are still reported to exist in areas of the northern papyrus swamp
of the lake. However these introductions were ineffective and a rapid population-increase
occurred in the 1 970s (Harper et al., 1990). For about a decade, Coypu were frequently
observed by lakeside residents, though in decreasing numbers after 1 980. No individuals
have been seen since 1984, and it is assumed that the population has died out.
The Lake Fishery
The fishery of the lake is based (with the exception of the Barbus amohiaramma catch)
upon artificially introduced species. These species are also essential in the maintenance
of some 80 species of piscivorous (fish-eating) birds, together with several species of
amphibians and two mammals. Although fish introductions began in the 1920s the
commercial gill-net fishery did not open until 1959, exploiting Oreochromis snilurus nioer
and Tilaoia zillii. The latter was initially only present as a small portion of the catch: the
first few years of the fishery coincided with a period of rapidly rising water-level which
was probably not favourable for the feeding and nesting behaviour of Tilaoia ziliii (Harper
et al., 199,0). A hybrid between 0. s. niaer and 0. leucostictus dominated the catch
6-70



through the early 1 960s.
From 1964 to 1976 the water-level remained high and was stable within a range of about
2 m, resulting in the formation of lagoons and littoral zones extensively colonized by
macrophytes. Siddiqui (1979) found that the lagoons were the preferred habitat of the
herbivorous, substrate-breeding T. zillii, whilst the lagoons and littoral were preferred by
OJleucostictus, as accumulations of detritus provided its major food-source, namely
chironomid larvae. Most hybrids and all 0. s. niaer had disappeared by 1971; this was
attributed by Siddiqui (1979) to the disappearance of weed-free breeding and nursery
grounds, the preferred habitat of this species. By 1975 the cichlid catch consisted of
about 74 per cent 0. leucostictus and 26 per cent T. zillii (Siddiqui, 1979). A decade later,
following the high water-levels and disappearance of lagoons and submerged plants in the
1 980s, the catch was less than 2 per cent T. ziliii, being 98 per cent 0. leucostictus (Table
6.8.4). This is still the approximate proportion of the commercial cichlid catch, although
experimental netting during 1 987 has recorded a higher proportion of T. zillii in the main
Lake and the dominance of this species in Oloidien Lake (which is closed to commercial
fishing) (Harper et al., 1990).
The gross tonnage of fish harvested from the lake has fluctuated considerably in the three
decades of the fishery (Figure 6.8.4; Table 6.8.4). Initially the mesh-sizes of the nets used
were 13 and 14 cm.- This was reduced to 11 cm by 1961 and to 10 cm by 1970
(Siddiqui, 1977). There was a rapid decline in catches in 1970-72 which Siddiqui (1977)
attributes to over-fishing, followed by strict enforcement of the 10 cm mesh by the
Fisheries Department from 1973 onwards. The fishery started to recover after 1975-76;
since then it has fluctuated, with two peaks and two troughs. In 1987-88 catches of both
Tilaoia and the Bass were low.
The crayfish fishery has had mixed fortunes in its shorter time-span. Initially opened in
1 975, catches of several hundred metric tonnes annually were exported, mainly to Europe,
up to 1 983. Since then, annual catches have averaged around 44 tonnes - for local
(tourist) consumption (Table 6.8.4).
6.8.6 Aquatic Vegetation in Lake Naivasha
The work by Gaudet (1977, 1979) described the aquatic vegetation of Lake Naivasha and
established that, with the exception of the spread of Salvinia molesta, the overall species
composition and distribution had remained relatively stable for forty years. Patterns of
change were apparent, as in the successive "reefs" of Papyrus that were formed when
'island" masses rooted in places of low water-level (Gaudet, 1977); but all the main
vegetation types - terrestrial colonizers of the draw down, emergent swamp vegetation,
a floating-leaf zone of water-lilies (Nvmohaea caerulea Savigny), and a submerged-plant
zone - were dynamic, with new populations developing as old ones were disappearing.
However the last two decades have seen dramatic changes in the plant communities
(Harper et al., 1990).

There was relatively little change between 1 960 (a period at the end of a low water-level
phase) and 1976 (a period of relatively high water-level), except that the raised levels in
1 976 had resulted in the formation of more papyrus lagoons, islands and "reefs", than had
existed previously (Harper et al., 1990). Mats of S. molesta had formed within these
lagoons in some areas.
By 1982, however, the period of rapid water-level increase had raised almost all the
Papyrus to form floating islands. These together with an increased quantity of S. molesta
mats, covered around 25 per cent of the lake's surface at any one time, moving to all
corners of the lake, under the influence of the winds. The water-lilies and all species of
submerged plants had ccmpletely disappeared from the main Lake, with consequences at
all levels of the lake's ecosystems (Harper, 1984). Submerged plants grew continuously
in the nearby Oloidien Lake throughout this period; but water-lilies, papyrus (Cvoerus
Dagvrus), cnd Salvinia molesta, cannot survive in Oloidien because of its higher alkalinity.
After 1983, the lake's water-level started to decline; between 1983 and 1985, Kenya,
along with most of eastern Africa, experienced a severe drought. By 1 984 most of the
papyrus had become grounded again as reefs, and much of the S. molesta had been
stranded by the receding water-iine. By 1987 the lake had returned to levels similar to
those experienced in the 1 950s; but its appearance was considerably changed in two
respects. The area of :apyrus had been more or less restricted to fringing reefs, the
swamps having been recuced by agricultural clearance in most of the northern half of the
lake - such that, by 1 9ES. approximately 1 2 km2 of original swamp had been reduced to
2 km 2, causing public c:ncern (Harper et al., 1 990). Further, between 1986 and 1988,
water-lily seedlings germinated in the lake's shallows, for the first time in almost a decade,
producing flowering clu.mps in many places along the eastern shores. Extensive beds of
submerged plants also reappeared, growing up to 400 m wide and in water down to 2 m
in depth (Harper et al., 1990).
Coincident with the chazges in the rooted aquatic vegetation, has been an increase in the
phytoplankton and a de_rease in transparency (Harper et al., 1990). The lake is now
displaying the same signs of "cultural eutrophication" as many lakes in temperate regions.
Underlying Causes of Ecological Change
Most of the dramatic changes in vegetation and fisheries have occurred over the last 1 5
years, and as Harper et al. (1990) notes there has been no concurrent wide-ranging
ecological monitoring cf the lake, so explanations have been pieced together from
scattered observations. The abundance of submerged plants in 1979 following a period
of rapid water-level rise, and then again in 1984-87 during a period of water-level decline,
suggests that aquatic plant species are able to adapt rapidly to water-level changes. The
reappearance of both s.bmerged vegetation and water-lilies after a period of up to 10
years' absence from the :ake is almost certainly a result of the disappearance of Coypu and
the population decline cf crayfish.
The loss of papyrus be:.veen 1983 and 1988 has been due solely to clearance for both
large-scale and subsistence agriculture, as Lake levels have declined. The reclaimed land
is flat and fertile and a most all is used for arable crops. Inevitably, the process has
increased the nutrient levels of the lake, both through leaching and runoff directly from
farmed areas, and throuch loss of the swamps' buffering effect in the inflowing river deltas
6-74



(Gaudet, 1979). Nutrient concentrations measured in the lake had approximately doubled
between August 1984 and August 1 988, (for example from a median of 45 to 125 mg/m3
of soluble nitrogen and from 5 to 12 mg/m3 of soluble phosphorus; Harper et al., (1990).
These are still fairly low by temperate shallow-lake standards but indicate a worrying
increase. Some studies are under way by Leicester University, England, on nutrient
budgets and sinks in the lake and a water quality monitoring program is being conducted
during this assessment study (and hopefully continued by KPC).
It could be argued that Lake Naivasha experienced low levels for more than a decade
earlier in this century, and that the recent phase was merely a repeat episode of little
concern. However, during the earlier period there was little agricultural activity and dense
papyrus swamps developed. The severe reduction in papyrus swamp area has led to fears
being expressed about the speed and incompleteness of recovery with increasing water
levels (Harper et al., 1990).
The vegetation - particularly the papyrus swamps - is the key to the ecological health of
the Naivasha Lake-system. The buffering effect of the papyrus is well documented, both
for the former north swamp area (Gaudet, 1979) and for other wetlands (Mavuti, 1981;
Howard-Williams & Thompson, 1985). The importance of papyrus and other aquatic
vegetation types at Naivasha extends far beyond their role in water chemistry. They are
a vital component in the habitat requirements of many birds and mammal species of the
lake. Surveys have shown (Harper et al., 1990) that the highest species-richness of birds
in the lake environs in 1987 occurred in marshland, submerged macrophyte and papyrus
zones. Fish eagles (Haliaerus vocifer) were more abundant in areas of lake-shore fringed
with papyrus and Acacia trees and less abundant where such vegetation had been cleared.
Hippopotamus numbers (Hipoopotamus amDhibius) and group-sizes were highest in the
western and southern areas of the lake, where papyrus and natural vegetation zones
(Acacia-Cassia scrub) were most extensive.
6.9 WATER QUALITY AND MANAGEMENT
6.9.1 Introduction
Water quality and quantity are important issues at North East Olkaria because of the
climate of the areas, the proximity and value of Lake Naivasha, and the problem of
dispersal of water borne pollutants.
Existing water quality data on wells in the North East Olkaria sector collected by KPC have
been reviewed in the following section (Section 6.9.2). A water quality profile of the
geothermal well water (generally referred to as brine because of its high concnetraion of
salts) in the north east field was initiated and is virtually complete apart from a few
remaining wells still to be drilled or tested. A wider monitoring program of water quality
was also initiated and the results presented in Section 6.9.3.
Disposal of geothermal waste waters poses a problem because the fluid is a brine
containing chemicals in concentrations that are potentially injurious to both flora and
fauna. A 64 MWe development produces a substantial volume of waste water, all of
which needs to be disposed of safely. The preferred option for waste brine disposal during
steamfield operation, and that recommended in the feasibility report, is for deep reinjection
into a number of purpose drilled or unused production wells, and this option is to be
implemented. This disposal option and temporary brine disposal options during the
6-75



construction phase of the development are assessed in Section 6.9.4.
6.9.2 Well Water-Quality
A summary of the chemical constituents of geothermal brine from wells under test is
presented in Table 6.9.1. These values can be compared with the general composition of
brine frorn some other fields (Table 6.9.1). The health limits given in the table were
obtained from the North East Olkaria Feasibility Study (1989) and the Ministry of Water
Development.
The North East Olkaria geothermal water has been described as a slightly alkaline sodium
chloride water containing approximately 0.3 per cent of gas and total dissolved salt
content around 2000 mg/kg (Ewbank Preece Limited, 1989). Being an alkaline brine the
water is saline though not to the same extent as many other geothermal locations and the
levels of sodium and chloride are also much lower than that of sea water. The brine, when
cool, has only a mildly salty taste and this does not seem objectionable to wildlife.
Comparison of the parameters with the listed health limits (Table 6.9.1) shows that the
greatest health risk comes from both fluoride and lead concentrations. Some health limits,
such as chloride, are primarily set for taste reasons rather than direct health concerns.
Therefore, although the brine is in excess of the health limit, it was not considered a
serious concern. With fluoride, an important point to remember is that the problem of high
levels is common to all water sources around Lake Naivasha and not just to geothermal
sources. However the levels in the brine are over twenty times greater than that found
in the regions major fresh water source, Lake Naivasha (Table 6.9.2). Although beneficial
in small concentrations (0.6-1.7 mg/I) for the structure and resistance to decay of
children's teeth, the concentration in the brine would cause pronounced mottling and
disfiguration of teeth and further related problems.
One interesting aspect with the North East Olkaria field is that the level of boron is very
low compared to that experienced in other geothermal developments (Table 6.9.1).
Normally, the concern with such developments is over boron toxicity and not fluoride and
Olkaria would seem to be a unique field in this regard.
The other element of concern is lead which is a serious cumulative poison. However, the
lead levels from the different wells are highly variable (Table 6.9.1) and consequently may
not always be of serious concern over the entire geothermal field. Along with many other
heavy metals, a substantial amount of research has been undertaken on the
bioaccumulation of lead in food chains. The greatest threat is to animal species at the end
of the food chain (for example carnivores including birds of prey).
Although by world standards the brine may not be considered particularly toxic, overall the
levels in Table 6.9.1 show that the brine is a potential health risk and must therefore be
disposed of in a safe manner. In particular, the concern would be for chronic symptoms
to develop) rather than acute. The lack of acute symptoms has meant that the brine has
often been considered harmless and little precaution has been advocated for its disposal.
However, it can take decades for accumulated levels of lead for example, to reach a point
where severe symptoms are evident. Such an effect is a concern with the operation of
the existing Olkaria power station, with break-through occuring into Hell's Gate gorge and
adds support for deep reinjection.

6.9.3 Wat:er Monitoring
As discussed in the intrcduction a water monitoring program  was initiated. The usual
approach to a sampiing program is to monitor water inlets and outlets from the project
area. In this case, water is taken from Lake Naivasha, but there are no surface outlets to
monitor discharge from the project. Reinjection is being used during the current phase of
the project cycle and wi!l also occur during the long-term commissioned phase. The

reinjected fluid will also be below the main perched aquifers so that groundwater
contamination of water drawn from wells will also not occur. This means that monitoring
is restricted to the water intake to the project (ie Lake Naivasha).
The monitoring at the water intake in Lake Naivasha, has been initiated mainly out of
concern for the health of the employees at the KPC housing estate. Factors such as pH
greatly affect the efficiency of water treatment. The other reason was that there did not
seem to be any systematic sampling in operation by the Ministry of Water and
Development. The initial results to date (Table 6.9.2) show that the coliform count is
highly variabie. The initial sample was probably left too long before being analyzed so that
the bacteria had multiplied before being counted. This is a common concern and the
second sample is thought to be more realistic. The fact that both samples are at or in
excess of the health limit, is an important result when considering the general health of
people around the lake and particularly KPC staff. The results emphasise that periodic
sampling is needed and just as importantly that the treatment facilities are carefully
maintained. The fluctuation in pH highlights the need for monitoring.
6.9.4 Water Disposal
Water disposal is required during all phases of the project cycle. During the current
development phase, there are only two wells still to be drilled but there are about a dozen
to be tested. The wells are expected to average 3 MWe each and produce about 5
cumecs of waste water every minute. This means, over a medium term discharge of two
months, about 400 000 cumecs will need disposal. The original practise of disposal into
gullies and natural drainage lines has led to serious erosion as described in an earlier
section.
Recently, KPC has initiated a program of piping all brine from wells being tested into a
collection pond adjacent to well Ml and then gravity reinjected to OW-RI adjacent to X2
campsite. This alleviates the problem of water erosion as well as avoids encouraging
wildlife from drinking the brine. A similar activity has been initiated for drilling waste-
water which can contain toxic compounds (e.g. caustic soda) and bentonite (making the
water extremely turbid). The waste-water is being ponded adjacent to well Ml and then
piped to a reinjection we'l. Such actions minimise the environmental concerns.
During the commissioning phase of a steam gathering system, a "steamblow" is required
to clear the new pipelines of debris before they are used to transmit steam. A large
volume of steam is necessary to completely scrub the line and usually several wells will
be opened concurrently and directed down the line. The end of the pipeline is open to the
atmosphere and can be environmentally damaging. Care needs to be taken over the
scheduling of the steam blow so that the number and the length of line to be cleaned is
never so great at one time that it causes problems of fluid disposal.
The chosen disposal method of the geothermal brine during the long term commissioned
phase is deep reinjection. By reinjecting the waste water at a depth approximately equal
to the production reservoir, there is little possibility of surface or groundwater pollution.
The main problem with reinjection is that the waste water contains high levels of dissolved
silica and calcium and as the fluid cools, the substances polymerize and precipitate (scale)
on to the pipes which gradually block-up. In order to minimize the possibility of scaling
there will be a large "conditioning pond" before the "cold" water is pumped for reinjection.
The pond will also be the collection point for brine from the separator stations.

6.10 SOCIO-ECONOMICS
6.10.1 Introduction
This section reports the results of the socio-economic baseline studies. It provides
information on the relationship of the project area to the administrative boundaries,
baseline data on population size, Hell's Gate National Park, economic structure and
labour, employment, community infrastructure, transport, Maasai and other issues,
which will assist in determining how the project will affect the social component of the
environment.
6.10.2 Location
Administrative Boundaries
The geothermal project area of 7 km2 lies within Naivasha Location (Figure 6.10.1)
which is within the Naivasha Division, which in turn falls within the Nakuru District.
The current administrative boundaries are shown on the map on Figure 6.10.2. Hell's
Gate National Park's southern and western boundaries concur with the boundaries of
Naivasha Location.
Impact Areas
The power station development area lies within the Hell's Gate National Park, which
was gazetted in 1984, three years after the East Olkaria Power Station commenced
operation.,  The proposed  site of the North East Olkaria Power Station  lies
approximately 3.3 km north-northwest of the existing East Olkaria Power Station. The
southern boundary of the closest flower farm (Oserian) is approximately 1.2 km to the
north-northeast of the proposed power station site. The Lake is approximately 5.3 km
to the north and Naivasha Town is approximately 22 km to the north-northeast.
Primary Irnpact Area - The primary impact area, for the purposes of the Olkaria socio-
economic assessment, is the Hell's Gate National Park. This area is consistent with the
anticipated envelope of potential physical impact, due to changes in air quality. In
general terms, this primary area is to the south of Lake Naivasha and accessed by Moi
South Lake Road.
Secondary Impact Area - This area was assumed to be the Census area mentioned
above as Naivasha Location. This area includes those areas where the direct workforce
and immediate suppliers of indirect labour (both for construction and operation) could
reasonably be expected to commute on a daily basis (see Figure 6.10.1).
Town Council Boundaries
In Government publications such as the 1979 census, Naivasha Township refers to the
10 km2 urban centre of Naivasha. However, 'Naivasha Township' is also used by
Naivasha Town Council to refer to the entire area covered by the council.  The
boundaries of this area are identical to those of Naivasha Location, except for the
Northern section. The area is 940 km2 and includes the project area (Figure 6.10.3)
Within this 'Township' area, lies Hell's Gate Ward, covering most of the area likely to
be affected by the project.

Naivasha Town
Naivasha Town lies 89 km north-northwest from Nairobi and 69 km from Nakuru Town.
It is served by the main road of Trans Africa Highway and the old main road from
Nairobi vvhich now mainly serves buses and heavy trucks. The main railway line from
Nairobi passes through Naivasha station.
The Town Centre, of about 25 km2, is administered both by the Council and the
Ministry of Lands.

Naivasha Trown had a 1979 population of 12 102. The rate of population growth since
1 979 is not accurately recorded, as the recent census was incomplete, and so current
urban populations can be assessed only by reference to the Central Bureau of
Statistics/UNDP forecasts of 1984 and Economic Review estimates. In the case of
Naivasha, a reasonable estimate, based on the experience of other secondary towns,
would be a conservative annual growth rate of around 6.5 per cent, giving a 1991
population of around 26 000.
6-84



However, it is noted that the current Nakuru District Development Plan anticipates a
population of some 38 620 by 1993, as follows:
Population Projection (Min. of Econ. Plan & Dev., 1981)
1 988       1 993
Naivasha Town     26 289      38 620
This suggests an annual growth rate in excess of 10 per cent, and is endorsed by the
1991 Economic Review, based on provisional figures for the 1989 census, which gives
a Naivasha Town Council figure of 34 500.
Based on this figure, the current population estimate is as follows, assuming a growth
rate of 7.5 per cent per annum after 1989:
1 979:      1 2 102
1 989:      34 500
1 991:      40 000
Primary Impact Area South of Lake
To the south of the lake, the Town Council indicates that around 40 per cent of the
'Township' population are within Hell's Gate Ward, ie around 48 000. Hell's Gate
Ward covers basically the area south of the lake. This population estimate of 48 000 is
estimated to break down roughly as follows:
Sulmac            :           15 000
Oserian           :           10 000
Kongoni           :              500
KPC                              800
Other                         21 700
Total             :           48 000
Migration
The major factors responsible for significant population influx into the Naivasha area are
listed below,
o     The buying and subsequent sub-division of former settler farms, such as
Green Gordon Estate, Karati, Marorigushu, Missouri, Mukiringiri, Maiura;
o     The opening up of the Moi South Lake Road area by the Olkaria
geothermal development. It is reported that there are as many as 700
people living in the Hell's Gate National Park area in around 230 shanties,
and;
o     The establishment of large irrigated farms.
Summary
Based on an extrapolation cf the 1979 Census and Council Sources the 1991
population to the south of the lake is 48 000. As noted above the population within
Hell's Gate National Park is cornposed of some KPC personnel and Park Staff.

6.10.4 Hell's Gate National Park
Background
As discussed above, the proposed power station lies, like the existing Olkaria Power
Station, within the boundaries of Hell's Gate National Park. This park was gazetted
several years after the geothermal development commenced and has been defined as
the primary impact area for this proposal.
The key hicghlights of Hell's Gate National Park are as follows,
o     Gazetted 2 February 1 984;
o     14 km from Naivasha town;
o     11 5 km by road from Nairobi;
o     Lies within Naivasha Division of Nakuru District, R.V. Province;
o     Approximately  one  half of the  park  contains  KPC  geothermal
developments;
o     Area: 68.25 km2 (6825 ha);
o     Managemen  is by the Department of Wildlife  Conservation  and
Management (now Kenya Wildlife Service);
o     The Government bought the land from private owners, notably Sulmac;
o     Features:
-     The Njorowa Gorge
-     Fisher's and Central Towers (geological formations)
-     Flora
-     Fauna
-     Possible habitat of the Lammergeyer
-     Can alight from vehicles and walk
-     Can relieve "weekend pressure" on Nairobi National Park, and;
o     Shares a warden with Mt. Longonot National Park.
Layout
There are three zones in Hell's Gate National Park as shown in Figure 6.10.4.

Wilderness:  2.    (75 per cent) - For Public access/climbing
Services:    3.    (11 per cent) - Adninistration/Gates/Campsites etc.
The area to the north and west of the Olkaria Geothermal Plant is currently in use by
the KPC for well exploration, testing and production.
Access to the park is by three gates:
o     Main Gate;
o     Olkaria Gate, and;
o     Narasha Gate (not currently used).
Adjacent Land Use
In the areas adjacent to Hell's Gate National Park, the main land uses are:
o     Livestock rearing;
o     Cultivation;
o     Human Settlement, and;
o     Infrastructure.
The inhabitants of adjacent areas move about with their livestock in search of pasture
and water. In some cases they encroach into the park area.
To the north and east, the adjacent land uses are:
o     Farm Estates (flowers and food crops).
To the south and south-east,
o     Marginal Land (Privately owned)
(Kedong Ranch Ltd, and Ngati Farmers Cooperative), and;
o     Wildlife dispersal zone.
Park Development Plan
The planning initiative for the park was set out in "Development plan for Hell's Gate
and Mt. Longonot National Park" - Barrah & Jenkins (1981). The current planning
document is "Management Plan 1985" (Wildiife Planning Unit), which is now the basis
for an updated plan, currently being developed by the Kenya Wildlife Service.
6-88



The stated objectives are as follows:
o     Conservation of unique scenic features:
o     Conservation of flora;
o     Conservation of fauna (including birdiife);
o     Soil Conservation;
o     Provision of wilderness enjoyment opportunities, and;
o     Provision of educational and research opportunities;
Other key features in the strategy are:
o     Relieves pressure on Nairobi National Park;
o     Forms an important link with Nairobi and Maasai Mara National Reserve
on the Western Tourist Circuit;
o     There had been no organised visitor survey, and;
o     The pattern of visits and accommodation is not known.
The park has some 51 km of boundaries, of which 41 km are not clearly marked or
fenced. The plan is to acquire additional areas south and east of the park, as shown on
the map below. It is planned to extend the present park as shown in Figure 6.10.5.
O     The 850 ha east of the gorge is known as the  "Amphitheatre". The
large tracts of land south of the park contain the gorge, and will be used
as a wildlife dispersal zone. They have little value for ranching. The
acquisition plan will open up access from the main Narok Road to the
lake, and will be complimentary to Mt.Suswa National Park.
Co-existence with Geothermal Development
The western half of the park is incorporated in a number of blocks of land gazetted for
geothermal exploration and development, a project which commenced many years
before the area was gazetted as a National Park.
The management plan expresses some concern about possible:
o     Pollution;
o     Effluent disposal;
o     Emissions, and;
o     Odour.

The plan notes that spatial expansion of the Olkaria geothermal area could be a
potential threat to the survival of ne park. It proposes that the Wildlife Conservation
and Management Department should control further exploration. It notes that the park
has been committed to tourism development, and "cannot be overrun by any other
development needs"
A suggestion appears in the Management Plan:
o     "Review of the park area versus geothermal development, with a view of
laying little emphasis on developing the park area under geothermal
exploration for conservation and touristic purposes. and placing more
emphasis on Mt. Longonot National Park, on the Longonot - Hell's Gate
corridor, and the expansion area.  A re-definition of Hell's Gate/Mt.
Longonot Park's boundary may be necessary."
It is clear from several meetings with Kenya Wildlife Services (KWS) that a land use
plan is now required covering both geothermal, tourism and wildlife.
Such a master plan is under discussion but is not complete. The present plan does not
fully take into account the plans and aspirations of both the KWS and the Ministry of
Energy. The implications of co-existence have not yet been identified, and neither have
guidelines for the management of such co-existence yet been agreed upon.
6.10.5 Regional Economic Structure & Labour
Naivasha Town
The economic structure of Naivasha town is shown in Table 6.10.2. There has been a
steady increase in agricultural empioyment. The other industry which has shown an
increase in importance is trade & catering, which is probably related to the growth of
the tourist industry. Employment in the energy related industry has gradually declined
within the township.

6.10.9 Community Infrastructure
The secondary impact area of Naivasha Location may be affected by the construction,
operational and induced population impacts of the proposed Olkaria development.
Consequently this sub-section briefly describes existing community infrastructure in the
recognised 'township area'.
The Local Authority indicated there is great pressure on existing resources and
activities in Naivasha Division.

The above data include the Rainbow pre-Primary School with a capacity of 60 pupils.
Sulmac and Oserian both have large Primary Schools.
Education officials are of the opinion, that there is a shortage of secondary school
capacity in the Town Council area. Particular attention was also drawn in the LADP
(1986) to the shortage of nursery schools, due to the rapid increase in population.
While the number of places in schools were not immediately available, it is clear that
with a population of around 15 000 in the township, of which 50 per cent may be
assumed to be under the age of 14 years, there is a severe shortage of facilities.
Currently Naivasha has the foliowing trade & tertiary institutions:
o     1 Secretarial college;
o     5 Village polytechnics;
o     A dairy training school;
o     Animal and Husbandry Research Institute;
o     National Youth Service. and;
o     Wildlife and Fisheries Training Institute:
Health Services
Current facilities are:
o     1 District Hospital (2 doctors);
o     3 Health Centres (public), and;
o     3 Health Centres (private).
Approximately seven private doctors operate private clinics.
The facilities are considered Iccally to be inadequate for the existing population. A
need has been identified for an extension of Naivasha General Hospital, particularly the
casualty department, and for health centres at four new locations.
Sulmac, Olkaria and Oserian have their own health centres.
Housing
There is generally considered zo be a shortage of housing in the urban area. The
majority of housing has been privately developed, or as site and service schemes.

Public
The largest developments of public housing are the Council houses, Iccated mainly in
Soloni ward.
The Council has a total of 465 housing units broken down as follows:-
Phase 1          -      10 units at 100/= per month
Phase II         -      197 units; of which
1 54 units at 1 50/ = per month
43 units at 1 00/ = per month
Phase IV         -      11 8 units of which
40 units at 1 00/ = per month
40 units at 85/= per month
38 units at 150/= per month
Phase V          -     96 units at 120/= per month
Phase VI         -    30 units at 500/= per month
Phase VII        -      16 units at 600/= per month
There are also "standard" houses. These are good public houses developed by the
council but let to private individuals. There are 9 units with varying rent levels.
Recently a new scheme of 75 units, under a tenant purchase scheme, was completed
by the National Housing Corporation in collaboration with USAID.
The Council has a total of 465 housing units.
Private
Most private houses belong to investors who own 1-3 plots, which they develop. Most
investors do not live in the houses but hand them over to private estate agents for
letting.
One private estate agent interviewed, suggested that of the self-contained houses,
approx:
o     5 per cent are one bed-roomed;
o     75 per cent are two bed-roomed, and;
o     20 per cent are three bed-roomed.
The principal residential estates and information about their capacities and monthly
charges are listed in Table 6.10.6.

Water Supplies
The town is about three kilometres from the shores of Lake Naivasha. Although it is a
fresh water lake, it is unsuitabie for human consumption.
The residents around Naivasha get water from the Malewa and Marati rivers. The town
has three !bore-holes which have reportedly proved inadequate to cope with the growth
rate of the population. Tap water for human and animal consumption is a problem, as
the water is inadequately treated and sewage overflow/outfall goes into the lake.
There are four public boreholes with a total maximum capacity of about 150 m3 per
hour. These are shown on the map overleaf.
Capacities
Borehole-A,  -  90. m3 h
Borehole-B   -  35. m3 h
Borehole-C   -   15. m3,-h
Borehole-D   -    7.5 m3/h
TOTAL          147.5 m3/h
Standard consumption rates are not available for Naivasha, but taking a number of 60
litres per clay per person, with an output off 70 per cent of peak capacity, this would
provide for a population of around 40 000.
However, not all of these boreholes are in good working condition.
The Council has also recently dug two new boreholes (1991) each with a capacity of
30 m3/h. One of the three old boreholes still needs a new pump for it to be fully
operational. The council plans to install a new pump with a capacity of 34 m3/h.

Recreation Facilities
Stadium
Naivasha Town Council has a stadium located between the main Trans Africa Highway
and the Community Hall. This stadium has a capacity of about 60 000 people. The
stadium is not strategically located, resulting in loss of revenue (through gate
collection), because people can easily watch matches from the flyover to the prison.
Community Hall
There is a small community hall, located next to the stadium which has a capacity of
about 100 people seated. It lacks any facilities such a conference room and places for
indoor games.
Public Parks
There are several open areas in Naivasha but none is designated as a public park. The
Council is planning to establish public parks with flower gardens and seating facilities.
6.10.10 Transport
Detailed traffic counts were carried out on Moi South Lake Road and Moi North Lake
Road from 6.00 am to 6.00 pm, Thursday to Sunday. There is very little traffic on
these roads after dark.
These are the two roads which may potentially be affected by the construction phase
of the project. However the effect on the Moi North Lake Road is likely to be minor.
Moi South Lake Road
Public Transport - Buses
Two buses operate on this route.
Each has a capacity of about 62 passengers. They charge 4/= per trip from Naivasha
town, the junction, and 20/ = from the junction of Moi South Lake Road to Olkaria
Passengers on this route mainly catch their buses at the main bus park in town,
opposite KGGCU or in some cases at the junction of the Moi South Lake Road.
The maximum number of buses travelling to Naivasha recorded in any one day was
four. These travel only between 6.00 am and 9.00 a.m., and between 12.00 noon and
3.00 p.m.
The pattern from Naivasha is similar, with up to three buses per day between 9.00 a.m
and 6.00 p.m.
This means a carrying capacity of 120-240 people per day in each direction, which is
very low compared to the number of people employed in these areas.
6-99



Matatus
Most of the matatus operating on this route are the pick-up type with a capacity of
about 16 passengers. They charge 5/= from town to the junction of Moi South Lake
Road and 20/= from the junction to Olkaria.
Matatus are considerably more frequent than buses. The average number of matatus
per day is 30 in each direction between 6.00 am to 6.00 pm, i.e. an average interval of
around 25 minutes.

The total vehicular traffic, both to and from Naivasha is reported in Table 6.10.7.

Matatus
interviewees reported that three matraus operate on this route but the consultants
recorded a maximum of two on all days, except Sunday. Typically, there are two
matatus per day in each direction. They travel from Naivasha early in the morning and
return in the afternoon. This means a carrying capacity of 32 people per day in each
direction.  It is clear that many local people depend on getting lifts with private
transport, lorries and tractors.
The matatus charge 71= from Naivasha to the junction of Moi North Lake Road, then
23/= to Ndabibi.
The total vehicular traffic, both to and from Naivasha, was as reported in Table 6.10.9.

Road Maintenance and Upgrading
The Trans Africa Highway passes through Naivasha, north of the town. This connects
Naivasha with both Nairobi and Western Kenya. The Old Naivasha Longonot - Nairobi
road is still used by heavy commercial vehicles and a limited number of tourists, and is
in poor condition. The Moi South and North Lake Roads were until recently only rough
tracks, but in 1991 a new tarmacked highway was completed from the Old Naivasha
road to Olkaria.
The following projects are set out in the current Development Plan:
o     Road CBS: Rehabilitate 39.5 km from Central/Rift Boundary to junction
of A104 at Naivasha
KL3950 000 (GOK);
o     Rehabilitation of 23.3 km of road from District boundary/Nyandarua to
Naivasha and to Moi South Lake Road
KL1 16 000 (G0K);
o     Gravelling Road D445: 9.4 km from junction D323 to Maiella centre:
(W. Germany: L35 250) (KFW);
o     Gravelling Road D394: 9.7 Km from junction Fisium to CBB Longonot.
(KFU: KL36 375):
o     Travelling E443 7.0 km from CBB Maai Maahiu Kijabe, and;
o     Bridge Maai Mahiu - Narok road 83.
Of most significance to the project was the recent upgrading of the main access road
into the project area from Naivasha.

6.10.1 1 Perceptions and Attitudes Towards the Existing Project
The principal socio-economic impact of the existing geothermal project, indeed the
entire geothermal program, has been its major contribution to the opening up of the
area south of the lake to rapid development, culminating in the building of a major
tarmac road from Olkaria to the old Naivasha-Longonot road. In terms of employees,
its payroll of around 2-300 represents only a tiny fraction of the total number of
employees south of the lake, estimated at over 8000.  In terms of pressure on
amenities in Naivasha township, the impact has been minimal, as KPC provides housing
and, like the flower farms, provides basic facilities such as a clinic.
A critical issue to resolve during the next phase of studies will be the resource
management question concerning the multiple use of Hell's Gate National Park. It would
appear from the attitudes expressed to date that there is a need for compromise
between the KPC , tourism and conservation interests.
The following section summarises attitudes towards the existing power development,
both from the local community and foreign tourist perspective.
Local Community
Local people interviewed both in Naivasha Town and around the Park exhibited a
generally favourable a-id positive attitude towards the geothermal project, citing the
greatly improved access to the area, and its beneficial effect on tourism and bed
occupancy, and on the local economy in general.
Where doubts and cor.:erns were expressed, they related generally to:
o     Possible pollution, including health hazards;
3     The leve of the lake, and;
o     Driving s-andard of KPC employees.
Some of the negative comments made, may be judged by the following selection of
responses. The impac. assessment report will address these perceptions in relation to
the new project.
Mr.   broached the subject on the effects of the project on tourism around Hell's Gate
National Park and Lake- Naivasha. He expressed deep concern that the project will kill
tourism in the area.
"Olkaria steam breaks down principally hydrogen sulphide.
The only known nullifier is Ammonia, a highly inflammable
gas plus salts of sulphuric acid which affects humans,
animals and plants".
"Irritating cough, long term effect. (cause hardening of
lungs). Acid rain is corrosive and can cause lung fibrosis
and acticn must be taken."
6-103



Fisherman:
"Bad smell like "choo".  After getting used you do not
smell, fish started declining in 1987".
"Extremely concerned about water from holes; decent
drainage is required instead of flooding land; information is
required about wind drift, noise and smell pollution."
Poaching will increase.
'Govt. experimental farm should be developed near the station to determine whether
the effluent affects flowers."
"Vegetation destroyed lake too long to revegetate.  Our 'exotic tourism' will be
affected. Moi-North South road will increase robbery and burglary in this area."
"We are worried about the disappearance of lake. The lake
has gone far down. Even when the lake fluctuation cycle is
considered, there are far too many people abstracting
water from the lake. It may disappear altogether".
"We are afraid tourists who are concerned about health and
pollution may be driven away by OGOP. The matter should
be handled with care because people may take advantage
of the special problem in our environment"
"Crime will increase due to easy communication".
Tourist Perceptions - Tourists in the Park
A four-day survey was conducted of all tourists leaving Hell's Gate National Park
though the Main Gate, in order to establish attitudes towards the existing geothermal
station. A total of 230 tourists were interviewed.
They entered the park as follows:
a     Main Gate                83%
o     Olkaria Gate             17%.
Those who entered the Olkaria Gate will inevitably have passed through the geothermal
development area, and some tourists who entered the main Gate also enter the
geothermal area, from the east. Altogether, some 25 per cent of visitors had entered
the area utilised by KPC. (57 tourists).
6-104



Those who entered the geothermal area answered as follows:
Yes      No
o Did you get out of your vehicle there?               20%       80%
o Did you look at any part of the geothermal project?   1 2%     90%
o Do you consider the geothermal project offensive?    0%        100%.
The majority of visitors, who saw something of the geothermal development, were
neither offended nor overwhelmingly interested in the development.
The 75 per cent who did not enter the geothermal area, i.e stayed within the eastern
half of the park, answered as follows:
Yes      No
o Were you aware of the power station?                 72%       28%
o Could you see it?                                    57%       43%
o Could you hear it?                                   10%       90%
o Could you smell it?                                   16%      84%
Clearly the visual sighting was the most frequent cause of awareness of the power
station, most tourists neither smelling nor hearing it.
All the interviewees were asked if they thought that a geothermal project could be a
tourist attraction, and 77 per cent answered "Yes".
Eighty-two per cent of tourists said that they would visit Hell's Gate National Park
again.
The broad conclusion is that most tourists do not enter the geothermal area, although
they are generally aware of the power station. It was apparent that most tourists have
no idea whether or not they are allowed to enter the area, but they do consider that
such a project could be a tourist attraction.
Tourists at the Lake Hotels
A survey was conducted covering 240 interviewees at Safariland Hotel and 241 at
Lake Naivasha Hotel.  The results are reported separately because there were
differences between the type of tourist frequenting those two hotels. The differences
relate to their knowledge about Kenya and the background to their visit: Safariland
tends to be visited by guests with local connections, experience of Kenya or special
interests. Lake Naivasha Hotel, on the other hand, represents the package tourist often
on his or her first trip to Kenya, with little local knowledge.
6-105



Safariland
Seventy per cent of Safar;land visitors were foreign tourists; 29 per cent were local tourists.
The foreign tourists respcnded as follows:
Yes  No  Don't know
o Have you heard of Hell's Gate National Park?     74%  26%
o Are you planning to visit HGNP?                  57%  43%
o Have you ever visited HGNP?                      21% 79%
o Are you aware that there is a geothermal power
station in the park?                             40%  60%
o Are you planning to visit the power station?     38%  62%
o Do you think a geothermal power project can be a
toujrist attraction?                             86%  2%   13%
o Do you think a geothermal power station is:
- Smelly?                                          34%  16% 50%
- Ugly?                                            9%   35% 57%
- Noisy?                                           57%  9%   34%
Lake Naivasha Hotel
Ninety-six per cent of visitors were foreign tourists;
Four per cent were local .ourists.
The foreign tourists respcided as follows:             Yes  No  Don't know
o Have you heard cf HGNP?                          17%  84%
o Are you planning to visit HGNP?                  7%   93%
o Have you ever visited HGNP?                      2%   98%
o Are you aware that there is a geothermal power
station in the park?                             0%   100%
o Are you planning to visit the power station?     0%   100%
o Do you think a geothermal power project can be a
tourist attraction?                              30%  14%  56%
o Do you think a geothermal power station is:
- Smelly?                                          6%   31%  63%
- Ugly?                                            9%   33%  58%
- Noisy?                                           42%  14%  44%
To date, there is no evidence that the presence of a geothermal power station is
putting foreign tourists off from visiting the National Park. Indeed, the relatively low
number of visitors to the park is more likely to be related to ignorance about the park's
existence, rather than tne presence of a geothermal power station. In the impact
assessment phase, it will be important to establish if the proposed location and the
considerably increased presence of power generation facilities will affect foreign tourist
perceptions of their Park experience. The issue of local tourism will also be examined.

6.10.12 Maasai
Background
Before the Maasai lived in the south of Kenya, they are thought to have grazed their
cattle around Lake Turkana in the north. In the eighteenth century they are thought to
have moved to the fertile plains of the Rift Valley. By 1 800, the land used by the
Maasai had spread to the south into today's Tanzania.
In 1910-11 the Maasai were forced to live in a smaller reserve, the approximate
boundaries of which are shown in Figure 6.10.6. This reduced "living" area was one of
a number of problems faced by the Maasai. Other problems included death 'of live
stock from  rinderpest and serious epidemics of smallpox and cholera.  Gradual
encroachment by other communities into traditional Maasai grazing lands continued to
take place. In the 1 940s, land was lost to the commercial sector and to wildlife
reserves. Government policies through the 1970s and 1980s have kept the existing
Maasai lands intact. However the reduced area of land and increasing population have
necessitated a trend from the traditional pastoral life to a more settled existence.
Maasai land in Kenya is presently administered from two District Centres, Kadjiado and
Narok (see Figure 6.10.6) (Sharmon, 1979). The district closest to the project area is
Narok and the south western boundary of the Hell's Gate National Park runs within a
few kilometres of the Narok District boundary. In 1979 there were 118 000 Maasai in
the Narok District, giving an average population density of seven Maasai per square
kilometre (Source: 1979 Census).
Earlier Narok was treated as a closed district, but it has now been settled by people
from other parts of the Rift Valley, Nyanza and Central Province, who have introduced
more conventional farming. The estimated composition of the population of Narok
District (Were and Olenja 1986) is as follows:
O  Maasai       57% (including 0.73% Okiek, a group related to the Maasai)
o  Kalenjin     28 %
o  Kikuyu       8 %
o  Kisii         2%
o  Other        5 %
Total      100%.
There have been a number of factors that have changed the pattern of traditional
pastoralism of the Maasai in Narok (Kituyi 1990). These are listed below.
o  Large companies such as Kenya Breweries and East African industries have
introduced large-scale farming of barley and rapeseed on leased land.
o  Other high potential areas have been developed as farms.
o  Individual and group ranches have been introduced  by the government
following independence with the objective of improving live stock production
and ensuring land rights for the Maasai.

MAASAI LANDS IN KENYA AND TANZANIA
SINCE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY



These progressive developments and acquisition of land by permanent immigrants, has
forced some Maasai away from well-watered areas to the north and west of the
district.
Base-line Data and Relationship with the Project
The area affected by the present geothermal development exploiting the East Olkaria
and the proposed development in the North East field is confined almost wholly within
the Hell's Gate National Park, which is within the Nakuru District and therefore outside
Narok District. KPC has developed a close relationship with Maasai close to the park
and power development areas. They have assisted in the provision of reliable water
supplies and in solving other community problems.  In addition, the upgrading
(tarmacking) of the Moi South Lake Road assists the Maasai as it does all people in the
area.   Maasai leaders are also represented on the Hell's Gate National Park
Management Committee and thus have an opportunity to interact with KWS. The
impact of the project on the Maasai is considered in Section 7.8.
Prior to gazettal of Hell's Gate National Park in 1 984 and for some period after, Maasai
settlements were established on land now defined as the park. There do not appear to
be written records of how many people resided in the park or who they were. The EA
team has undertaken a series of interviews to determine the extent of the occupation.
The survey was undertaken by interviewing the leaders of two Maasai settlements on
the boundary of the park.  Following information from  these interviews further
interviews were held with Maasai who had formerly resided in the park and were
presently living in the area between the southern boundary of the park and Suswa. All
interviews were conducted with the assistance a KPC employee, who provided
assistance in communication.
A summary of the notes made during the interviews of two leaders of the settlements
closest to the park are set out below. The locations of these two settlements are
marked as "Silas" and "Peter" on Figure 6.10.7. It should be noted in all estimates of
the population of Maasai involved, the estimates of the number of children associated
with "families" are estimates only.
Baba Peter/Mama Peter - 19 December 1991 (afternoon)
This "family" occupies the closest manyatta to the park and is one of four within 1 000
m of each other. The interview was with Baba Peter and Mama Peter. At the time of
the interview, the "family" had six members and one visitor from Suswa. They graze
400 cattle and 400+ sheep/goats. They have lived at the site for approximately 20
years. They have children (number not revealed) all of whom were born in the
"village". The oldest is 13.
They take water from several sources inciuding the lake and the pipeline running from
the lake to Suswa. The tap on the pipeline is one kilometre from the manyatta. Their
biggest problem is water. The pipeline cannot always supply enough water. Their
livestock graze an ill-defined area of the "undeveloped" land to the south. They cannot
graze in the park which is to the north.
The mother of the family (Mama Peter) considers the next biggest problem, after water,
is lack of educational facilities for her children. Next problem is security of livestock
from predators (lion/leopard).

They make frequent journeys to the Sulmac and Naivasha shops. They will shop may-
be twice a week or seven times per month. They get money from selling livestock.
They have strong social links with other Maasai in the Suswa area to the south.
At this stage the total number of Maasai in this area would appear to be approximately
20-30.
Silas Suntia and Catherine Suntai also in attendance Nkoitiko and one other man and
some children - 21 December 1991 (morning).
Silas is the head man of his manyatta. He speaks English and has been educated at a
secondary school in Ngong. He keeps a diary of major events and his business dealing
and so would appear to be a reliable source of information concerning recent history, in
particular the timing of events. He commenced residence in Hell's Gate in 1984.
Previously he at lived at "Suswa" and prior to that he had worked for Magadi Soda.
In September, 1987, he was given four days verbal notice to vacate the park. At
11.30 am on the 1 6 September, 1987, he was made to leave as part of KWS's policy
for managing the park. From KWS's point of view the Maasai settlements in the park
are not legal and there is a clear incompatibility between the KWS land use of the area
as a game park and the Maasai use for grazing. He was given no compensation or
assistance in moving. He relocated to the Narasha entrance to the park10, but had to
sleep without shelter until new huts couid be built. (Clearly this is some resistance to
being moved). He says approximately 1 5 "families" were moved from the park at this
time. In another part of the interview, he estimated that ten manyattas were moved
and that each manyatta would hold approximately 30 people including children. This
means approximately 300 people were moved.
He currently owns 200 goats/sheep and 40 cattle. Shopping is done at Maielia shops
(approximately 10 km) twice per week. They take water from local creeks in the wet
season, or from a KPC water tank when river water is not available. His plans for the
future are to grow wheat/barley near Suswa where he has some land.
Table 6.10.12 provides information on the "families" of Maasai who occupied Hell's
Gate National Park. These people now reside outside the park, mostly on the land
between the southern boundary of the park and Suswa. From the table it is estimated
that the total population of Maasai residing in the park was 64 adults. If each wife had
on average four children the total population of the park would have been
approximately 240.
Because the existing and proposed power stations are almost totally within the park,
the impact of the power station on the Maasai will be negligible.
10 The Narasha entrance to the park, although marked on some maps, is not a formal entrance to the
park. It is not manned by KWS and the access from the this area to other parts of the park is impossible
except with tour-wheel drive.

6.10.13 Olkaria Archaeology
An archaeological survey (carried out in conjunction with the National Museum) has
been completed in the project area and the complete results are reported as Appendix
6.10 to this report.
There are no registered archaeological sites likely to be affected by the project. The
nearest sites (listed in Appendix 6.10) are al! too far from the project to be affected
either by interference, damage or changed or impeded access.

7. Environmental Assessment
7.1 FLORA
Introduction
This section describes the predicted impact on flora of the drilling, construction and
operational activities at the proposed North East Olkaria Site. In addition it presents the
results of studies of the impact of the existing power station on natural vegetation and on
flowers which are grown commercially in the area.
A problern encountered with many impact assessments is that judgements have to be
made without any analogous developments in similar situations. This is not the case at
Olkaria, vvhere the current geothermal power station provides a strong indication of the
likely extent and magnitude of impacts on the vegetation for the North East Olkaria
development.  The vegetation map shows no observed differences in the various
vegetation types (communities) between the possibly affected catchment containing the
existing station and the North East Olkaria development catchment. Although the different
community types were "ground-truthed" their distribution was identified from aerial
photographs. This limits comments on development impact to "visible" community
changes. The concern that emissions from the existing station may affect vegetation in
more subtle ways led to two further studies being carried out. The first was to compare
quantitative data on species diversity and abundance between the possibly affected area
(ie adjacent to the existing station) to that of a relatively remote and unaffected area in
another catchment. The second study related to concern over the close proximity of the
commerciial flower growers. This involved the growing of commercial flower species at
differing distances from the cooling towers. Further details and discussion of both studies
are given in Sections 7.1.2 and 7.1.3.
7.1 .1 Olkaria North East Site
Impacts During Construction Phase
The opening up of the North East Olkaria Site for drilling will involve the construction of
a road and the clearing of the actual site for a well. This will result in the removal of the
original vegetation, however in the case of the road which will be only five metres wide
on average, the impact on vegetation is likely to be minimal.
Of greater significance is the effect of clearing the drilling site where natural vegetation
covering an area of approximately half an acre will be completely removed. Although
natural revegetation has taken place in other areas where sites have been cleared, it is
basically with opportunistic species of ruderal habitats which colonise sites after
disturbance. Revegetation of this type begins with annual weeds such as the grasses
Diaitaria ve_utina, Chloris ovcnothrix, Chloris viraata, Setaria pumila along with herbaceous
species such as Datura stramonium, Solanum incanum and the biennial shrub Nicostania
alauca.
There are two remedies to prevent this type of revegetation. Firstly, the site cleared for
well drilling should be kept to a minimum as tar as practicable to ensure minimum
7-1



disturbance of natural vegetation. Secondly, perennial species which are indigenous to the
area should be introduced immediately, preferably stoloniferous grasses in the form of
runners, for example Cvnodon dactylon and Cynodon niemfuensis which are referred to
as Star grass. Chloris aavana, known as Rhodes grass, is also suitable and may be
introduced by seed or cuttings.
Natural revegetation takes time and exposes the site to the possible adverse effects of
erosion. Steps should be taken at the outset to prevent this. Woody plants such as
Acacia xanthophigea Dodonea anoustifolia, Olea euroroaea, Euclea divinorum  Acacia
seval, Acacia perrandil, Grewia similis and Trema cuineensis could be introduced into
cleared sites to stabilise the soil as well as forming part of the process of replacing
indigenous vegetation. All of the above species of grasses and woody plants occur in the
area and establishment should not be difficult, particularly as an adequate water supply
should be available.
Sump ponds are other areas which need stabilisation once they have been constructed.
The sides should be re-seeded with the same grasses recommended for the padsites.
Kikuyu grass (botanically referred to as Pennisetum clandestinumlis) can also be used to
stabilise the piles of soil surrounding these ponds to reduce the possibility of erosion. This
grass will thrive in an area with deep soil deposition and is easily introduced through
stolons.
Impacts of Atmospheric Emissions
It is difficult to assess precisely the impact of hydrogen sulphide emissions on vegetation
aithough the predicted ground-level concentrations (see Section 7.4) are such that there
are unlikely to be major adverse effects. It is recommended however that monitoring of
potential long-term effects on natural vegetation be carried out in the area. To this end
a study was undertaken to compare species diversity and abundance in affected and
unaffected areas. Details of this study are presented in Section 7.1.2
A program to assess the possible impacts on the commercial flower farms in the area is
being carried out in the form of a flower growing trial and is discussed in detail in Section
7.1.3. This will be a continuing program and in addition it is recommended that there
should be several small "flower gardens", possibly in moveable containers scattered
throughout the site, particularly on high ground, where hydrogen sulphide concentrations
are predicted to be greatest.
Effects of Fire
It is evident that fire has been playing a role in maintaining the proportions of Acacia -
Tarchonanthus - and grasses in most of the area where these occur. Tarchonanthus
comohoratus is a fire-tolerant species with a tendency to sprout back after a burn.
Themeda triandra is another species which has evolved successfully with fire in east Africa
rangelands, where burning tends to increase range biomass production under this particular
grass.
The overall effect of fire on these communities would be to perpetuate those species that
are fire-tolerant to the detriment of others which are susceptible to destruction by fire.
There are several factors, however, that influence fire in rangelands, such as the season,
availability of fuels, prevailing winds and so on, which are beyond the scope of this report.
It is noteworthy that prolonged incidence of fire in a range area like Olkaria would
eventually introduce more open plant communities with reduced dense bushland. Thus
7-2



Tarchonanthus - Themeda - Acacia- Setaria/Diaitaria associations would have a tendency
to predominate in rather open bushed grasslands should repeated incidences of fire occur.
One of the problems associated with the presence of developments such as the Olkaria
power station in a park area is that the natural cycle of bushfires may be disturbed. It will
be important to continue to monitor the ecology of the flora and if necessary take
appropriate action, such as controlled burning. This should be left entirely in the control
of KWS, but the Env:ronment Unit of KPC should be fully informed.
Impacts of Brine Release
The release of brine into ponds from the existing power station has influenced the growth
of Tvoha and Cvoerus as the main wetland plants able to resist the high levels of
concentrated salts. This type of vegetation seems to be tolerant to the brine, but at the
periphery of the ponds, Acacia xantholoholea should be introduced rather than Eucalvotus
species. The pepper tree Schinus molle normally has a shallow root system and in volcanic
soils this type of root.ng is unlikely to support the growth of large trees for a long period
of time.. There are suitable indigenous trees such as Olea europeas ssp africana, the
African olive, which would certainly do well in this environment. Various species of Ficus
could also do well in zhis area and are fairly easy to establish.
It is predictable that the vegetation of gullies and luggas is likely to be adversely affected
by brine if these are used as drainage channels. Normally these drainage areas do not get
water alt regular intervals throughout the year, only during the rainy season. Having brine
trickle constantly throughout the year would certainly introduce changes in species
compos,ition. Sedges are likely to invade the channels, but the steep slopes are not likely
to be affected, since -he level of brine is fairly low. Silt depositions in the channels tends
to form dry season grazing areas with Pennisetum, Setaria and a host of palatable
herbaceous species, :vhich will certainly disappear with the introduction of brine.
The release of brine into drainage channels should therefore be discouraged and as much
as possible the brine should be held in the drainage ponds closest to the source. The more
environnnentally acceptable way of discharging brine would be to deliver it in concrete
piping to a central pcnd, ensuring that it does not come into contact with vegetation or
wildlife and even domestic livestock. Ideally, and this is the intention at Olkaria, the brine
should be reintroduced into the ground, through deep wells which are unlikely to produce
steam,
7.1.2  Natural Vegetation Trials
To assess the likely impacts of the proposed power station on the abundance and diversity
of natural flora, a study was carried out comparing areas which would be likely to be
affected by the existing power station with more remote areas where the power station
should have no impact.
The presence or absence, or marked change in relative abundance, of certain species of
known environmental tolerances and preferences have been used as indicators of habitat
conditions. Species may be of indicator value either, because they are very intolerant of
degradecl conditions, and therefore first to disappear following disturbance, or because
they are unusually tolerant of degraded conditions and survive, where others will not.
Species of greatest indicator value are those that are:
7-3



1.    Sufficiently widespread in most sites within the habitat type;
2.    Sufficiently narrow in environmental tolerance to a particular stress or so
that changes in the species' relative abundance reliably indicate particular
habitat conditions;
3.    Sufficiently short generation time so that population changes due to the
changing environmental conditions can occur rapidly, and;
4.    Sufficiently abundant so that fluctuations in population numbers are
substantial in magnitude with changing levels of environmental stress.
The key point is that species responses/tolerances have to be known. There is generally
a lack of such specific information for the species found at Olkaria.
The use of lichens as morphological indicators of air pollution is now well developed
(Hawksworth 1976, de Wit 1976, Denison 1973). One of the best-tested generalisations
is that fruticose lichens (with branched structures well above the surface) are more
susceptible to sulphur dioxide damage than foliose lichens (whose leaf like thallus lies
nearly flat on surfaces) and that both are more susceptible than crustose lichens (which
embed the tissue in the cracks of bark, soil and rocks). In areas not burnt, numerous
lichen species were present on both Acacia dreDanolobium and Tarchonanthus
camohoratus trees. All three of the diagnostic growth forms were found at Olkaria which
suggests atmospheric pollution is not severe. Further investigation and comment was
limited by the lack of suitabie habitat not affected by the fire. This parameter remains as
a possibility for future monitoring.
Another approach was used in which detailed studies were made of species diversity and
abundance in different plots. The same vegetation type was studied both close to the
existing power station and over two kilometres away in the North East Olkaria
development catchment in an area near X2-Camp. All of the sites were classed as the
same type of bushiand vegetation (type "B" on the vegetation map).
Four plots, each of a hectare, were studied. Within each plot, the different plant species
were recorded (Table 7.1.1).
The list of species present in each plot can be used as presence-absence data to measure
the similarity between the sample plots. Similarity measurements based on such binary
data are the simplest type, but fail to provide some measure of the relative importance of
the species in the community. The latter limitation is discussed further during the
discussion of the results.
7-4



The basic data for calculating binary (or association) coefficients is a 2 X 2 table (Krebs,
1989):
Sample A
# Present  |  # Absent
Sample B     # Present  |       a              b
# Absent          c              d
Where:      a = Number of species in sample A and sample B (joint occurrences)
b = Number of species in sample B but not in sample A
c = Number of species in sample A but not in sample B
d = Number of species absent in both samples (zero-zero matches).
There is considerable disagreement in the literature about whether d is a biologically
meaningful number. However in this study, the absence of certain species in the pair of
plots being analysed but present in the other sample plots, was thought to be relevant.
Consequently, a simple matching coefficient (S) that makes use of both negative matches
as well as positive matches was used:
'; = (a + d)l(a + b + c + d)
The similarity values (S) range from 0 (totally dissimilar) to 1 (identical).
The calculated similarity values for the four plots are given in Table 7.1.2. The results
show that the pairs of sites closest to each other are the most similar, that is those close
to the existing station (a and b) and those nearer X2-Camp (c and d). The similarity
between the areas adjacent to the existing station and that of X2 camp was lower. This
type of result could be argued as indicative of a difference in species composition between
the two areas brought about by the effect of the current station.  However, such
statements are clearly invalid because the diversity of species present was in fact greater
adjacent to the existing station than at the relatively remote site near X2-Camp (Table
7.1 .1 ).
The classification of the two areas as the same class of vegetation based on aerial
photographs but obviously different when compared in terms of species composition, was
of concern. The probable reason was, as mentioned earlier, that relatively few species
were abundant in the areas and the rare or uncommon species were biasing the similarity
results (i.e. being based on diversity rather than any abundance measure). This point can
be seen when only the dominant types of vegetation in the areas are compared. To do
this, the forbs and succulent species were deleted from Table 7.1.1 and only the shrub
and grass species were compared in terms of similarity using the same method described
before. The results in Table 7.1.3 show an increase in similarity between the different
sites, particularly betvieen the pairs of sites adjacent and remote from the existing power
station. The results confirm that the small and not very abundant species (primarily forbs)
were the reason for the relatively poor similarity figures between the two areas.
Based on the above results, there would not seem any indication that vegetation diversity
had been affected by the existing station. Although classified as one type of vegetation,
7-5



there are pronounced differences in species composition between the different locations.
These differences, however, are not due to changes in dominant (abundant) species but
small and relatively uncommon forbs and succulents.
The existing station has been operating for over a decade. After this length of time, the
chronic effects could have caused a reduction in abundance of certain species (especially
annuals) or a failure to re-establish resulting in a greater proportion of bare soil (ie
increased erosion potential). A survey of 20 subplots showed that the proportion of bare
soil was no greater than that found at the remote sites near X2 camp (Table 7.1.4). Also,
the greater species diversity is an indication that the sites were unlikely to be devegetated.
7.1.3 Flower Trials
Introduction
The primary objective of the flower trial was to investigate the effect (if any) of the
existing power stations's cooling tower plume on flowers grown in the vicinity for
commercial purposes.
Two sites were selected in the prevailing downwind direction from the gas ejectors and
cooling towers. The first site, referred to as the lower site was situated 600 m from the
towers, while the second (upper) trial site was 1.2 km away. The purpose of selecting
sites at different distances from the towers was to assess both the effects of air pollution,
in particular hydrogen sulphide, from the cooling tower emissions on flower growth and
also any gradient in plant susceptibility.
The species and varieties planted out in each of the two trial areas were as follows:
1.    Ornithopolum arabicum (arabicum)
2.    Limonum sinuata (statice) var. blue
3.    Limonum sinuata (statice) var. white
4.    Dianthus carvoDhvllus (carnations) var. ferore
5.    Dianthus carvophvllus (carnations) var. bonita
6.    Dianthus carvoohvllus (carnations) var. rony.
Each variety was planted in beds (1 x 10 m) at a density of 32 plants per m2 and the beds
replicated four times at each site (Figure 7.1.1 and 7.1.2 ). The trials were set out in a
randomised block design and the planting out date for each bed is also shown in the
figures.
A weekly schedule of fertiliser and fungicide/insecticide spraying was followed as
recommended by the Oserian Estate. Considerable effort was made to reproduce the
standard practices and procedures normally followed by the Oserian Estate for their
commercial plots.
In general the damaging effect of a toxic substance can be broadly correlated with dosage.
that is the combination of exposure concentration and exposure time. However, the
physiological mechanism of acute toxicity (high concentration over a short time period)
may differ from that of chronic toxicity (low concentration over a long period). In the

present situation, the ground-level concentrations of hydrogen sulphide at the trial sites
are such that chronic, rather than acute effects, are likely to be observed.
Chronic exposure of plants to low concentrations of pollutants can cause progressive leaf
chlorosis and premature senescence, symptoms which can be difficult to recognise in the
presence of other environmental stresses. In contrast, high concentrations generally cause
visible lesions as a consequence of the death, drying out and bleaching of localised areas
of leaf tissue. In some cases, the causative agent can be identified from the characteristic
injuries it induces; for example sulphur-dioxide generally causes chlorosis between the
veins of a leaf. Examination of leaf material by a hand-lens failed to show any obvious
injury though there was leaf "tip burn" in the arabicum. Such injury can be caused by
atmospheric pollutants (ie hydrogen fluoride (HF)), but was thought more likely to result
from soil chemical concentrations.
In practice, there are no widely applicable concentration thresholds for the appearance of
visible symptoms because of interactions between pollutants and environmental factors
and the great variation between species and populations in their resistance to damage.
Furthermore, combinations of pollutants will act to give different thresholds and
symptorns .
In soils with rather low levels of sulphur, the fumigation of plants by sulphur-dioxide has
acted as a fertiliser, giving stimulation rather than a reduction in growth. Similarly,
sulphur-dioxide can also improve dry matter production by controlling plant diseases (i.e.
acting as a fungicide).
A factor to be remembered is that plants photosynthesise during the day. At night the
stomata, through which most gases enter or leave the plant, are closed resulting in a
reduced susceptibility to pollutant molecules. Therefore the daily dispersion pattern from
the powier station may be of greater importance to the surrounding vegetation than the
nocturnal.
Results
The plant: species arabicum (Ornithooolum arabicum) has shown distinctive leaf "tip burn"
and bacterial pathogen attack (Erwinia spp). It is distinctly more pronounced at the site
closest to the station, however early documentation and identification of the symptoms
did not reveal whether the Erwinia was the primary cause of the damage or a secondary
factor following initial damage from other causes. In an attempt to identify the cause of
the damage, a series of chemical analyses of soil and tissue samples was undertaken
comprising the following:
o     1 8 tissue analyses, 6 for each plant species
o     6 soil analyses, 3 from each site taken at the top, middle and bottom
sections of the beds.
The results of these are presented in Tables 7.1.5 to 7.1.8
It is possible that the observed "tip burn" in the arabicum species is due to boron toxicity
rather than the effects of hydrogen sulphide. This could enhance the likelihood of fungal
attack by Fusarium and/or Pithium spp. on the roots or lower stem. The soil analyses

show high boron concentrations and also a large degree of variation in concentration
within ithe trial area, particularly at the site closer to the power station. There is also a
marked difference in pH between the sites, with an average pH of 7.4 at the site closer
to the power station (lower site) and an average pH of 6.1 at the more distant (upper) site.
This may also be a contributing factor in leaf damage.
Several other soil chemical concentrations differ noticeably between the two trial sites
including, phosphorus, sodium, copper, iron and zinc. Such differences confound the issue
of whether atmospheric contaminants are contributing to the toxicity observed at the trial
site closest to the plant.
It is difficult to predict which plants will be most susceptible to air pollution damage.
There are a number of morphological features of arabicum which make it likely to be
resistant to air pollution effects. In particular, the leaves have a large smooth surface area
and an undissected leaf margin which would result in laminar flow over the leaf, leaving
a relatively thick area of still air between the leaf surface and the potentially polluted air
flowing over the leaf. Thus the rate at which the arabicum ieaf would be brought into
contact with air pollutants could be less than plants with a rougher leaf surface. The leaves
are also giossy, indicating the presence of cuticular wax which coats the leai surface and
can act to exclude airborne pollutants. The greater susceptibility of lichens to air pollution
damage relative to higher plants is likely to be due to their lack of waxy cuticle. In addition
young plants which are cuticle thin and senescent plants which may have cracked cuticles
have been shown to be susceptible to pollution.
Carnations on the other hand have quite different morphological features, including hairy
leaves vvhich could create localised turbulence as air flows over the foliage. This
mechanism could bring the pores of the leaves (stomata) which absorb gases into greater
contact with air pollutants than the smoother arabicum leaves. Leaf hairs (trichoma) could
also aid in the entrapment of particulate matter and moisture which may contain sulphate
particles or other air pollutants. However it is possible that the hairs could act as filters
which ultimately reduce the amount of pollutants absorbed. Carnations studied in the trial
areas showed no obvious symptoms of any leaf damage. Similarly, no leaf damage was
observed for the statice plants.
It was considered unlikely that the observed leaf "tip burn" in the arabicum was due to
atmospheric emissions. Differences in soil composition between the two trial sites were
judged to be more significant factors, although the responsible elements and mechanism
of action have not been determined. While the difference in soil composition at the site
closer to the power station may be related to its proximity to the plant, this will have no
bearing on the commercial flower farms in the area, the closest of which is 1.2 km from
the proposed power station. In any event the disposal method for hydrogen sulphide
emissions from the proposed power station will result in much lower ground-level
concentration than those arising from the existing power station. The additional impact
of the proposed power station will therefore be low and certainly much lower than if the
existing power station were to be duplicated. In addition the commercial flower farms will
experience lower concentrations of hydrogen sulphide than either of the trial sites.
7.1.4 Summary of Recommended Management and Monitoring Procedures
The major visible impact of the proposed Olkaria power station on flora is the clearing of
natural vegetation for drilling sites and plant. In addition the release of brine into ponds
7-1 9



and drainage channels such as gullies has already affected the balance of vegetation in
these areas. Other more subtle long-term effects are less obvious and need to be
carefully monitored. These include the effect of atmospheric emissions on natural
vegetation and commercial flowers and the potential effect of the development on the
balance of the ecology through disruption of the normal patterns of grazing and the natural
cycles of bushfires. Initial studies indicate that these impacts are likely to be minor but
the studies should be continued to confirm that this is the case.
The following management and monitoring strategies are recommended.
1.    Keeping the area of natural vegetation cleared to a minimum.
2.    Deep reinjection of brine and drilling water to avoid potential toxic effect on
flora.
3.    Cleared areas should be quickly rehabilitated with appropriate indigenous
flora to prevent the growth of opportunistic species.
4.    Monitoring of the abundance and diversity of natural vegetation should
continue. If necessary, appropriate action should be taken by KWS such as
controlled grazing and burning of park areas. The Environmental Unit of
KPC should be made fully aware of all such activities.
5.    The potential effect on local flower farms should be monitored with the
flower trials continued for a total of two years. If the Oserian Estate wish
to extend the trials longer than this they should be given access to the
plots.
7.2   SOILS
It is inevitable with a development of the type of the North East Olkaria Project that some
impact on soils will take place. However, if appropriate and timely erosion control
techniques are used, these can be kept to a minimum and the problems which have
developed as a result of the existing operations, can be avoided. Most of the issues have
already been discussed in Section 6.3 in relation to the existing development.
The following mitigating measures are recommended for the proposed development.
Construction Phase
Some disturbance of the soil will inevitably occur during the construction phase but this
can be minimised by revegetating the disturbed area as soon as possible so that soil
erosion does not occur. As discussed in Section 6.3, native grasses such as Star grass
should be planted as quickly as possible. It is pertinent to note that vegetation that is
attractive as animals as a source of food should be avoided in the first instance when
attempts are made at revegetation. Even strong fencing around areas being revegetated
has proved insufficient protection against the larger herbivore such as buffalo. To avoid
problems of this sort it is suggested that less palatable plants such as the Tarconanthus
Camohoratis-Oleleshua, which is native and widespread in the area should be used.
7-20



Operational Phase
Care wiill have to be taken to attend to erosion problems as they arise and not allow the
level of erosion that has occurred in the past. The proposed method of disposal of well
water and brine by deep reinjection will eliminate flow of surface waters and therefore
development of the deep gullies, which are characteristic of the type of erosion problem
that has occurred in the past.
Runoff from roads has the potential to cause erosion problems, however if the road
surfaces are properly maintained and runoff can be diverted at regular intervals to avoid
build up of water, erosion problems will be minimised.
It is recommended that effectiveness of the erosion control measures be monitored. Soil
conditions should be reviewed, at monthly intervals during construction and at yearly
intervals during operation, by a soils expert. Finally, it is recommended that KPC nominate
an officer to take reponsibility for the day to day control of all activities that could lead to
soil erosion. The officer should be briefed by a soils expert as to the nature of risks and
should be provided with sufficient authority to direct contractors concerning day to day
activities that could lead to erosion.
7.3 FAUJNA
Introduction
This section deals with the impacts on fauna of the existing power station and those of
the proposed North East Olkaria well during the development, operational and
abandonment phases. The main areas of concern are the loss of habitat from a variety of
causes; the potentially toxic effect of brine used for drinking water, the death of animals
through road accidents and the conflicts caused by the presence of human settlements
within the park.
7.3.1 Imnpact of Existing Power Station
Loss of habitat
The area of habitat within Hell's Gate National Park is already restricted. The park is
relatively small and wildlife density for most species is above that of most other parks.
In addition, extensive areas within the park are rocky, steep and inaccessible to most large
mammals. Much of the areas outside the park boundaries, which formerly provided
dispersal zones, have been taken over by intensive agriculture or ranching farms.
The physical facilities for the existing East Olkaria power station, which include the power
station buildings, roads, steam pipes and the well-heads, result in a minor reduction in the
area available as wildlife habitat. These facilities have then been enclosed by a wire-mesh
perimeter fence which surrounds the entire original steam field. Some new make-up wells
are beyond the perimeter fence. The perimeter fence serves little purpose and is an
impediment to the movement of wildlife, preventing grazing animals from using the space
between the wellheads and around the power station. In the case of fire, local extinction
of enclosed species could occur. This impact is restricted to medium to small sized
mammals that cannot pass through the wire-mesh. Most larger mammals would have left
the area during construction as a result of human harassment. Very large animals such
as buffalo are capable of breaking down fences and would not be trapped.
7-21



This impact can be for the new power station can be mitigated by erecting fences only
around selected facilities that need to be isolated from human interference:or th-ose which
may be dangerous to animal (for example switchyards). Animals could then make use of
the area between the individually fenced areas thus minimising the area converted from
wildlife use to producing electricity.
Drilling Water and Brine
Current Station
The quality and availability of surface water is critical to wildlife species such as zebra and
kongoni which must drink daily or every other day. The brine from the current station is
used by these species and also by buffaloes which break the wire-mesh fence. However,
the level of chemicals in the brine, particularly fluoride, may constitute a health risk, even
though by world standards the brine is not particularly toxic. Grazing animals may be
affected by fluorosis which affects hoofs, bones and teeth. However the level of fluoride
in the natural drinking water, for example Lake Naivasha, is high.
North East Olkaria
Currently, drilling water and brine is held in fenced ponds. However, the maintenance of
the fences is very poor and animals have access to and therefore drink the water. An
example of this problem is the pond adjacent to MI which is broken in many places. The
composition of drinking water can alter reproductive physiology and the consequent
changes in the breeding success rate may influence the overall survival of the species.
Measures should be taken to avoid this problem including game-proof fencing of the
ponds, the disposal of drilling water and brine outside the park, and the reinjection of
drilling water and brine.
Open drains for brine and drilling water
The drains have an insignificant impact on large mammals, however they act as barriers
that prevent movement of small mammals, with relatively small home ranges. This
problem can be overcome by the use of covered drainage and if this is not possible having
the open drainage running along already established roads and other infrastructure.
Steam Pipes
The elevated steam pipes in the existing power station interfere with movement routes of
animals in addition to taking over space that would otherwise provide extra habitat. The
pipes also have a negative visual impact which reduces the natural appearance of the area.
The impact can be reversed by having the pipes underground with permanent cover that
can allow revegetation or a cover of removable concrete slabs to facilitate repairs in case
of breakages.
Roads and traffic
High speeds of vehicles to and from the other power station cause accidents that kill wild
animals. The only way to avoid this is to reduce the speed limit on these roads. This will
be difficult to enforce unless speed humps are introduced at appropriate points along the
route.
7.3.2 Impact of North East Olkaria Development Phase
Roads and Padsites
The main negative impacts resulting from the construction of access roads and padsites
7-22



are loss of habitat, the blocking of migration routes and initiation of soil erosion, leading
to further habitat loss.
Although not geographically continuous, the development would cause segmentation of
the already limited habitat resulting in the isolation of animals to smaller areas. This
situation, in the long term, can lead to habitat overuse, destruction and inbreeding of the
confined species. Roads also cause high mortality of wildlife, particularly if there is
vehicular movement at night.
These impacts can be reduced if the roads and padsites take up the minimum area possible
once the required equipment is in place. At the padsites, rehabilitation (revegetation)
should be initiated by planting indigenous species. The steep slopes of most padsites
should also be terraced to increase the rate of revegetation and to decrease soil erosion.
Once revegetation is in place it should be monitored on a regular basis. Permanent plots
in representative padsites should be set up and monitored for vegetation growth (cover,
richness, rate of growth of woody species) and utilisation by wildlife both in space and
times.
Sump Ponds
The main impact of the sump ponds is the loss of habitat, although this would be of limited
extent. Poisoning of animals may occur if they have access to and drink the brine and
drilling water. The areas adjacent to the ponds may also change in vegetation type,
structure and microclimate resulting in further habitat alteration and possible loss.
Periodic examination of avifauna is recommended to detect any pathological defects that
may arise from toxic levels of chemicals in water and vegetation.
Well Drilling and Testing
The main impact of the drilling and testing activities is the water and brine which contain
toxic levels of some chemicals. Noise may also keep the animals from preferred habitats.
Reinjection of the water and brine, game fencing to keep animals from using the drilling
water and brine will minimise this impact.
Construction of Station, Office and Estate
The negative impacts include the following:
o     loss of habitat and disturbance of the substrate leading to erosion and
further habitat loss;
o     noise from equipment and people, dust which covers forage making it
unsuitable for consumption by animals;
o     human harassment of animals, and;
o     blockage of normal diurnal and seasonal movement of animals.
The proposed location (PS-A) has several animal trails that cross the road and are
frequently used by buffalo, zebra and kongoni. No matter where the power station is
located, this would be the case. The disturbance although a negative impact is not
7-23



unacceptable.
Disturbance of the habitat should be kept to a minimum in terms of areas used and design
of the physical facilities. During construction, sites should be fenced in, so that no further
habitat is lost. The labour force should be kept to the minimum size possible. Areas
adjacent to the proposed site for the station should be identified for providing alternative
trails or movement routes for animals. If too steep, some landscaping may be considered.
The distribution, abundance and movement of animals should be monitored.
Power Transmission Corridor
The impact of the power transmission corridor is likely to be negligible, because generally
the vegetation in this area is low and because there will be minimal disturbance to
vegetation.
Production Steam Pipeline
The main impact of the steam pipeline will be the prevention of the already established free
movement of animals. Because the pipe cuts across most of the Olkaria North East, this
impact is of considerable magnitude and extent.
The adverse impacts can be reduced by ensuring that the siting of the pipe does not cut
across major animal movement routes. The pipe can also be designed in such a way that
it is underground totally or only in areas where it crosses a major animals' trail. The latter
alternatives would provide corridors for gullies that form major routes for animals when
moving from low flat plains to higher elevations of their home ranges. The movement of
animals can be facilitated further by creating corridors to surrounding ranches or acquiring
the ranches to be part of the park.
It is important that animal distribution density and movement patterns are monitored.
Waste Disposal
Garbage from equipment, construction material and domestic sources can cause significant
impacts. Garbage can be eaten by wild animals making them change natural feeding
habits. Garbage can also poison animals and increase conflicts because of more contacts
with people. Inadequate care can make the impact very extensive in the immediate
environs of human habitation and construction sites.
To minimise this impact, it is essential that there is total observation of park laws which
prevent any form of littering. The impact will also be reduced by the collection and
disposal of waste to areas outside the park. It is recommended that in the longterm, there
is no human settlement within the park.
Revegetation
This will have positive impacts if local indigenous species of plants are used.
Exotic species
The influx of construction teams and outside workforces into an area, can result in the
introduction of exotic plants and animals. In the case of exotic animal species, the impact
can be significant with domestic dogs and cats preying on wildlife and together with
poultry, transmitting diseases to local species. This impact can be avoided by ensuring
that domestic animals are not allowed into the park as required by park regulations and by-
laws.
7-24



Exotic plant species from outside the park (including those from overseas, that might come
commercially or accidentally with equipment) can have negative impacts on the local
species and overall ecology of the park. Normally such species flourish, excluding the local
species, because exotic species do not have the competitors that would normally exist if
they were growing in their native habitat.
Measures to avoid these impacts include the fumigation of equipment from overseas. The
labour force should not be allowed to grow ornamental plants, or any type of crop or plant
outside their houses. Any exotic species entering the park and germinating accidentally
should be uprooted.
The construction site and associated human settlements should be monitored for exotic
animal and plant species.
Labour Workforce
The main impacts of the labour workforce on the local environment include;
o     direct killing of animals for food, through conflicts or accidentally;
o     noise and animal harassment;
o     use of wood for fuel and other purposes;
o     indirect negative impact on tourism, and;
o     waste disposal.
The impacts can be managed by keeping the labour force to a minimum size by allowing
only individual workers (and not their families) to reside in the park. As discussed earlier,
it is recornmended that in the longterm there is no human settlement within the park. The
number of people at the construction site should be monitored regularly at Olkaria Gate
and in the employment records. Workers behaviour and attitudes towards wildlife should
be monitored with the aim of teaching them how to reduce human wildlife conflict. Night
activities should be banned to allow animals to have access to areas and resources
inaccessible during the day, because of human presence and construction activities.
Fencing
The major impact of fencing is the restriction of animal movements. The amount of
fencing will be kept to the minimum possible. It should also be close to the construction
so that large areas which are not needed are not enclosed and therefore inaccessible to
animals.
Fencing should not be required around existing human settlements, provided people comply
with park regulations. This would have the additional benefit that grass lawns in these
areas could be a source of forage for wildlife.
Fire
Bush fires are difficult to put out in steep, rocky and rugged terrain like Hell's Gate. The
fire destroys habitat and kills small vertebrates and invertebrates. The fire also alters the
microclimate. The extent and magnitude of the damage is determined by the amount and
degree of dryness of fuel material. Fires can be caused by deliberate actions, carelessness
7-25



or by accident.
Construction workers should be informed on the dangers and implication of bush fires,
how they can be prevented and put out.
Temporary and permanent firebreaks should be erected where construction activities are
likely to cause fire. Surveillance and warning systems should be established especially
during high fire risk periods. In addition, fire-fighting equipment should be in place to help
in fighting fires before they consume extensive areas.
Fire when properly, used creates an appropriate mosaic of open grassland and bushed
habitats that in turn are occupied by corresponding fauna.  Prescribed burning and
monitoring programmes should be initiated to control accumulation of fuel, active growth
of quality grass layer and increase richness of plant and animal species.
7.3.3 Impacts During Operation Phase
Road Surfacing
The main impact of road surfacing is loss of habitat. In addition, tar roads do not allow
infiltration of rainwater and instead the water gathers into large volumes that can cause
erosion or collect on lower grounds into temporary ponds. The ponds can have a positive
impact by attracting waterbirds and other animals, adding to the attractions in the park.
If the ponds carry water for extended periods, new plant association can form with species
such as A. Xanthoohloea, Cvoerus spp and Papyrus spp.
Runoff water from the roads in steeper areas should be gathered in drains and directed to
holding ponds or a central area for use by animals and for improving the rate of
revegetation. The ponds should preferably be located in areas which have been impacted
on negatively and which are undergoing rehabilitation.
Vegetation composition and use of the area adjacent to the roads by wild animals should
be monitored.
Waste Disposal
Impacts, mitigation measures and required monitoring are similar to those of waste
disposal during construction phase.
Revegetation
Impacts will be positive provided that local indigenous species of plants are used.
Fire Risk and Exotic Species
Impacts, mitigation measures and required monitoring are similar to those during the
construction phase.
Labour Force
Impacts are similar to those encountered during the construction phase. The presence of
a workforce within-the park can give rise to problems of fire, noise and animal harassment,
waste and sewage dumping, turning animals to garbage feeders, poaching of wildlife and
removal of dead resources such as wood for fuel and human and wildlife injuries or death.
Mitigation and monitoring programmes are the same as those for the construction phase.
7-26



All necessary actions should be taken to reduce human-wildlife contacts and conflicts. In
addition no shopping or trade should be allowed inside the park.
Separators and Cooling Tower Emissions
There is no evidence of any impact on fauna.
Traffic
Impacts of traffic on fauna include the following:
o     accidents that kill large and small mammals and birds;
o     fire caused directly or through people in vehicles;
o     off-road driving also destroys the habitat and disturbs the normal
behaviour of animals, and;
o     vehicles cause noise and dust and also contribute (although to a
lesser extent) to littering.
Impacts can be reduced by the introduction of speed limits and prohibition of off-road
driving. Avoidance of the use of heavy vehicles also reduces negative vehicular impact.
The density of off-road tracks and the number of vehicles should be kept to a minimum.
Adherence to park regulations should be actively enforced.
7.3.4. Abandonment Phase
Structure Removal and Road Clearing
The main negative impacts during the abandonment phase are the loss of habitat
associated with leaving abandoned plant, equipment and buildings without any attempt at
rehabilitation. Unplanned, careless and disorganised removal of physical facilities can
cause further loss of habitat. Once the structures are removed the sites can be left to
undergo succession, or be rehabilitated to achieve average status with the neighbouring
area. An additional problem is the abandoned wells (holes) which can be a wildlife and
human hazard.
Negative impacts can be reduced by consideration in the planning stage of the design of
some of the physical facilities and roads with the aim of transfering them to tourism and
wildlife viewing circuits once the project is abandoned. Most of the buildings should be
semi-permanent so that they can be easily removed with little disruption. Professional
removall of plant and building will also ensure that no further loss of habitat and
unnecessary disturbance of wild animals which may have learnt ways of living alongside
the project during its operation period. After the removal of plant, revegetation should be
encouraged to increase the rate of recovery.
7.3.5 Summary of Recommended Management and Monitoring Procedures
The following is a summary of the management and monitoring procedures recommended
to protect wildlife from the negative impacts of the development.
7-27



1.    Game-proof fencing of the holding ponds to prevent poisoning of wildlife.
2.    Deep reinjection of drilling water and brine.
3.    Location of drains and pipelines so that they do not form barriers for small
animals.
4.    Introduction of speed humps to reduce animal deaths from excessive vehicle
speeds.
5.    Minimising the area taken up by roads, padsites and plant to reduce loss of
habitat. Vegetated gullies are important refuges for animals and these
should not be interfered with during any stage of the project cycle.
6.    Training of workers regarding park regulations particularly with regard to
interaction with animals and littering. KPC should ensure that poaching does
not occur and personnel found interfering with wildlife should be dismissed
7.    Adequate facilities for waste disposal.
8.    Bans on the introduction by the workforce of exotic animals (such as
domestic dogs and cats) and exotic plants (apart from indoor plants).
9.    Cleared areas should be rehabilitated with indigenous vegetation as soon as
possible to restore habitat
10.  In general, fencing should be kept to a minimum to avoid loss of habitat.
Care should be taken to ensure that there are no small animals trapped
inside fenced areas.
11.   Animal numbers, movements and distribution should be monitored. This
should be done either independently by KPC or in liaison with KWS. KPC's
Environmental Unit should actively participate in these studies and should
be made aware of the findings of these studies and the management
decisions which are made as a result of these findings.
1 2.  Vehicle movements within the park should be monitored.
1 3.  It is considered desirable that in the longterm  there are no human
settlements within the park.
1 4.   KPC have three senior members of staff on the Hell's Gate National Park
Management Committee. The personnel are the Geothermal Development
Manager, the Geothermal Scientific Superintendent and the Environmental
Scientist. An excellent working relationship has been established and there
is an effective mechanism by which KWS can influence KPC's activities on
a day-to-day basis and in the longer-term. This Further a committee known
as the Wildlife Conservation/Geothermal Exploration and Development
Committee has been formed to monitor the development of the geothermal
resource and the Hell's Gate National Park. This committee will focus on
longer-term strategic issues.

7.4   AIR QUALITY
This section describes the predicted impact of the proposed North East Olkaria Power
Station on air quality. The impacts are considered in conjunction with the impacts of the
existing power station as these effects will be cumulative. The approach to air quality
assessment which has been adopted in this study has been to use a dispersion model to
estimate ground level concentration of hydrogen sulphide. This was identified in Section
6.6 as the only air emission likely to have significant local impact.
The prolposed development will have no impact on the local climate, however geothermal
power stations emit methane and carbon dioxide which are both greenhouse gases. The
power station will have no significant effect on the climate of the area. Carbon dioxide
emissions from the existing and proposed power stations generating 1 09 MWe for a year
are estimated to be 87 200 tonnes. An equivalent amount of electrical energy delivered
by a coal-fired power station, with 37 per cent efficiency burning black coal with calorific
value of 23 MJ/kg and carbon content of 65 per cent, would result in the emission of
approximately eleven times as much (964 027 tonnes) of carbon dioxide. Nevertheless,
the quantities of these gases emitted will be substantially less than from a fuel-burning
power station of a similar capacity. The amount of methane emitted is estimated to be
11 9 tonnes per year for the two power stations generating 1 09 MWe for one year. This
emission will have no measurable environmental effect. In addition the extent of the
environmental impact will be considerably less than for a coal-fired power station as there
are no associated mining activities apart from the drilling of the wells.
7.4.1 Approach Used in Modelling Analysis
The Dispersion Model
Dispersion modelling has been used to assess the potential air quality impacts due to
operaticn of the power station. The model used is known as AUSPLUME. It is a model
developed by the Victorian Environment Protection Authority (VEPA) for use in licensing
of stationary sources. It was developed originally from the United States Environmental
Protection Agency's ISC-ST model but has been modified progressively to incorporate
improvements in dispersion modelling practice as these are made available by the modelling
community. Its principal features, reievant to the present study are listed below:
o     Provides predictions for any user specified averaging period from three
minutes to 60 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 hours; 7 days, 90 days
(running averages), 3 months, or the full period of the meteorological data
file;
o     Includes the effects of building-wakes following procedures as set out by
Huber and Snyder (1976) and Huber (1977) and Bowers et al. (1979);
o     Takes account of the transformation of a pollutant with time using an
exponential decay with time, and;
o     Takes account of the effect of terrain on ground-level concentrations using
the procedures developed by Egan (1975).
The model includes many other features that are not listed above because they were not
used in the application of the model in the present study. A full description of the model
7-29



is provided in the user's manual (VEPA, 1986). This document is held by KPC Limited.
Application of Dispersion Model
The model has been used to predict ground-level concentrations of hydrogen sulphide over
a regularly spaced rectangular grid of points (29 by 39) covering an area 14 km (east-west)
by 18.667 km (north-south). The grid spacing used was 333.3 m and the southwest
corner of the grid was at 192 OOOE and 9897 OOON on the Longonot (1:50 000)
topographical map, East Africa (Kenya) Series Y73 1 (DOS 423) Sheet 1 33/4 Edition 7 (DOS
1975). To take account of the effects of terrain, each grid point had an elevation
associated with it which was read from 1:1 0 000 topographical maps when possible and
from 1:50 000 maps when the area was not covered by the 1:10 000 scale map.
Dispersion modelling simulations were undertaken for 1-hour, 24-hour and 1-year
averaging periods. Three cases were simulated:
o     Case 1 simulating dispersion of hydrogen sulphide assuming emissions take
place from the existing East Olkaria Power Station operating alone (existing
situation);
o     Case 2 simulating the dispersion, assuming emissions take place from the
North East Power Station alone, and:
o     Case 3 simulating the dispersion of hydrogen sulphide, assuming emissions
take place from the East Olkaria Power Station and from the North East
Power Stations at the same time (proposed situation).
Oxidation of Hydrogen Sulphide
In the atmosphere, hydrogen sulphide is oxidised to water and oxides of sulphur. The
principal reactions are:
OH + H2S < -     > HS + H20                                        (1)
HS + 02  < ---  > SO + OH                                          (2)
SO + 02  < ------- > Sulphur oxides                                (3)
Cox and Sheppard (1980) and Cox and Sandalls (1974) provide further information on
these reactions and provide data that allow the average removal rate of hydrogen sulphide
to be calculated. Using average figures, namely a reaction rate 5x10-12 cm3/s (Cox and
Sheppard 1980) for Equation 1 and an average hydroxyl concentration of 3x10o6
molecules/m3 (Cox and Sandalls, 1974) it is possible to estimate an average value for the
removal rate of hydrogen sulphide. This was estimated to be approximately 5 per cent per
hour, which has the equivalent exponential decay of 1.425x10'5 s'1, when used in the
AUSPLUME model.
Model runs with and without the decay, showed very little difference over the grid. This
is not surprising, since plume travel distances within the grid are typically less than 1 6 km.
Even in light wind conditions, it is unlikely that wind speeds of less than 1.0 m/s would
be encountered at the effective height of the plume and therefore travel times are unlikely
to be much greater than four to five hours. This would give rise to depletion of hydrogen
sulphide in the plume of between 20 and 23 per cent, that is 20 to 23 per cent of the
hydrogen sulphide in the plume will have been transformed by the time the plume has
7-30



travelled 1 6 km or so. While this is not a particuiarly sionificant depletion it has been
taken into account in the modelling, as it is believed to be more realistic than not including
it.
7.4.2 Emissions
The dispersion model also requires data on emissions from the power stations. Table
7.4.1 lists the required emissions data for the East and North East Power Stations if they
both operate at their maximum power levels and the hydrogen sulphide emission levels are
as high as they are ever likely to be. The emission figures are based on approximately 4.7
per cent of the non-condensable gases being hydrogen sulphide.

7.4.3 Comparison of Plume Rise at East Olkaria and North East Olkaria Power Stations
From the point of view of dispersion modelling and from the resulting impacts, there is an
important difference between the existing and proposed power stations. The difference
is due to the way in which the waste hydrogen sulphide is disposed of in the two power
stations.
The North East Power Station will discharge the non-condensable hydrogen sulphide in the
cooling tower plume, whereas the East Olkaria Power Station discharges the hydrogen
sulphide through three pairs of gas ejectors located on the main power station building.
The cooling tower plumes have a substantial plume rise compared with the plume rise from
the gas ejectors. Table 7.4.2 shows the effective height of the plume (that is the plume
rise plus the height of the emission point) from the two sources under a range of wind
speeds under stable atmospheric (Pasquill-Gifford F-class) conditions. These are the
stability conditions when plume rise would be expected to be at its lowest.
The table shows that under low wind speed conditions, the plume rise for the proposed
7-31



power station is between three and four times higher than the plume height from the
existing power station.  This leads to substantially lower predicted ground-level
concentrations. Plate 3 in Section 2 shows plumes of condensing water vapour from the
cooling towers and the gas ejectors of the East Olkaria Power Station. The plate confirms
that the plume rise from the cooling towers is substantially higher than that from the
ejectors.
7.4.4 Assessment of Impacts
7.4.4.1 Impacts in the Development and Construction Period
Drilling of wells has very little effect on air quality except for minor emissions of exhaust
fumes from diesel engines and the generation of dust from vehicles travelling on unsealed
roads. In the Olkaria environment, the impacts are unlikely to ever reach unacceptable
levels and need no special controls.

Testing of wells does. have the potential to damage vegetation close to the well by
allowing hot steam to "burn" plants and allowing hot brine and silica in solution to come
into contact with nearby plants. This can destroy plants. However the vegetation will
recover and the effect is temporary and confined to the proximity (a few tens of metres)
of the well. Well-testing also has the potential to cause odour impacts if undertaken close
to residential or work areas. Some wells at North East Olkaria have affected both
vegetation and the quality of the air with respect to odours.  However, given the
temporary nature of these impacts, it is considered that these are acceptable provided
adequate buffer zones are maintained. For some wells the impacts at X2-Camp may not
have been acceptable initially and the well development program was modified.
Construction work will involve the generation of dust as site works are undertaken and as
vehicles travel on unseaied roads. This has the potential to affect air quality at X2-Camp
and water carts should be used to minimise dust from construction activities. With these
simple controls in place, air quality impacts will be maintained at acceptable levels.
The effective plume heights shown in the table have been calculated using AUSPLUME's Brigg's (1975)
plume rise equations including building wake and downwash etfects if applicable. The nominated wind speed
in the table refers to the speed thar would apply at 10 m.

7.4.4.2 Reliability of Model Predictions
The basis of the impact assessment for the operational phase of the development is a
comparison of predicted ground-level concentrations with various criteria relating to either
health or nuisance effects.
Inaccuracies may arise in the modelling for the following reasons:
o     the meteorological data may be inaccurate or not representative of
the area being studied;
o     the emissions data may be inaccurate;
o     the dispersion model may not faithfully simulate the physicaJ
processes2 associated with the dispersion, and;
o     the model may not faithfully simulate the chemical process involved
in removing the pollutant from the plume.
In the present study, considerable efforts have been made to ensure that representative
and reliable input information has been used. Where uncertainties apply, it is believed that
conservaitive approaches have been adopted. That is assumptions have been adopted that
will exaggerate impacts rather than understate them, while at the same time preserving
realism in the assessment.
In impact assessment for green-field projects, dispersion models are used directly and there
is no opportunity to check the accuracy of the model. For the present study there is a
limited opportunity to compare the measured concentrations near the existing East Olkaria
Power Station, with predicted concentrations. This comparison is of limited value because
the two power stations have substantially different emission characteristics (see discussion
on plume rise below) and further, the range of concentration measurements is small and
confined to an area close to the power station where concentrations are expected to be
high. Nevertheless it is interesting to compare the predicted ground-level concentration
under the dispersion conditions that gave rise to highest concentrations reported in Table
6.6.2.
If the hydrogen sulphide concentration measurements presented in Table 6.6.2 are
reviewed, it will be seen that the highest measured concentration was 1.25 ppm (1.52
mg/m3). This occurred on 27 December, 1991, with light winds, (2 to 3 m/s) blowing
from approximately 1 80 east of north, at a site approximately 160 m from the central gas
ejector. From the time of day and the cloud cover at the time, it can be determined that
the prevailing atmospheric stability would have been Class-D. Under these conditions, the
dispersion model predicts that the 1 -minute average ground-level concentration would be
1.71, 1.45 and 1.26 ppm for 2, 2.5 and 3 m/s wind speeds respectively. The model
therefore appears to have a tendency to predict concentrations that are higher than
measured by between 1 and 40 per cent. Readers are cautioned against assuming that
the results of this "test" would apply under all dispersion conditions
2 These include the equations that account tor plume rise, the effects of terrain, tne effects of building-
wake turbulence as well as tne dispersion process.
7-33



It should be noted that the scientific community would generally expect model predictions
obtained using an advanced gaussian dispersion model (of the AUSPLUME class) with good
quality meteorological to "be accurate to within a factor of two".
7.4.4.3 Impact Assessment (Predicted Maximum Concentrations)3
Impacts ha.ve been assessed by comparing the air quality criteria discussed in Section 6.6
with predicted concentrations for 1 -hour, 24-hour and 1 -year averaging periods for three
cases, one with the existing East Olkaria Power Station operating alone (existing situation),
the second with the proposed North East Power Station operating alone and the third with
the two power stations operating together (proposed situation).
It will be clear that predicted concentrations are too low to give rise to effects on health.
Also concentrations are too low to affect vegetation. However, it is predicted that there
will be detectable odours due to emissions of hydrogen sulphide over a wide area. The
impact of odours depends not only on the intensity of the odour but also on the frequency
with which the odour occurs. For this reason we analyse impacts in two different ways.
Firstly, consider contours of the predicted maximum  1-hour, 24-hour and the annual
average concentrations. For the 1-hour and 24-hour predictions, the contours do not
reflect the dispersion pattern for a particular hour or 24-hour period but rather are a
composite drawn from the highest predicted 1 -hour or 24-hour concentrations that occur
for each receptor throughout the year.
These contour plots show that the power stations will not comply with the strictest criteria
for the protection against nuisance impacts, at least not in all areas. Given this, the
contour diagrams are not particularly helpful in assessment of impact because they do not
provide any information on how frequently odours may be detected. To provide this
information, cumulative frequency plots have been calculated for selected residential areas.
These show how frequently a particular value of hydrogen sulphide concentration would
be expected to be exceeded in a twelve month period. These are more useful for
assessing air quality at a particular location, than the contours of the maximum predicted
concentrations.
The predicted ground-level concentrations for the combined operation of East Olkaria and
North East Olkaria are shown in Figures 7.4.1 to 7.4.3.  Predicted ground-level
concentrations for the separate power stations are pesented in Appendix 7.4.
An interesting factor apparent from a comparison of the predictions for the East Olkaria
Power Station (Figures 1, 2 and 3, Appendix 7.4) with the equivalent figures for the North
East stations operating alone (Figures 4, 5 and 6, Appendix 7.4) is that the ground-level
concentrations due to the North East Power Station are much lower than those from the
East Olkaria Power Station. The introduction of the North East Power Station makes very
little difference to ground-level concentrations, although the North East Power Station will
have over 40 per cent greater generating capacity than the existing East Olkaria station.
The reason for this was discussed in Section 6.6.
31n this section the a:r quality criteria expressed in ppm take account of the fact that the typical
atmospheric pressure at Olkaria will be only 80 per cent of standard atmospheric pressure. The same
adjustment has been made in converting the concentrations of hydrogen sulihide trom the model predicted
pg/rm 3 to ppm.

East Olkaria Power Station
Examining the predicted ground-level concentrations in detail, it can be seen that the
highest predicted concentrations occur in the immediate vicinity of the power station.
Maximum 1-hour averages occur towards the north (see Figure 1, Appendix 7.4). The
contour plotting process smooths out the highest concentrations and although the
maximum contour level shown is 2.0 ppm, the maximum predicted 1-hour concentration
was 6 ppm (1-hour average) and the equivalent short-term average over a few minutes or
so may be a factor of 1.8 higher at 11 ppm (13.4 mg/m3). This concentration occurred
under Class-E stability, with a wind speed of 1.1 mis from 53 degrees. It clearly relates
to a condition when the emission is trapped in the building-wake turbulence, in a wind
blowing along the length of the power station.
Eight-hour average concentrations would be expected to be 0.66 times the predicted
maximum 1 -hour concentrations and thus the very highest 8-hour average concentration
expected at ground-level .n the ambient air close to the power station (the fenced area) of
the station, would be approximately 7 ppm. This is below the 1 0 ppm occupational health
exposure level.
Further, from the power s-ation it can be seen that 1 -hour average concentrations and of
course 30-minute averages (which would be expected to be approximately 15 per cent
higher) exceed the 0.03 ppm Californian 1-hour criterion, 8 km from the East Olkaria
Power Station and even 'urther, if points on elevated terrain are considered. The WHO
recommended 30-minute goal would be exceeded out to even greater distances. This
makes it necessary to examine the frequency at which various concentrations will be
exceeded at various residences. This is done later in this section. No threats to health are
posed by the predicted concentrations.
Figure 2, Appendix 7.4, s,.ows a maximum contour of 0.2 ppm. The maximum predicted
ground-level concentratici was 0.45 ppm. The recommended WHO goal is 0.125 ppm
(at 80 per cent of sea-level pressure). It can be seen that this contour extends to
approximately 1 .8 km to -ne northwest of the existing Power Station. This standard is set
to protect the health of iumans with a safety factor of 100. No non-KPC controlled
residential areas are affec:ed. Visitors to the Hell's Gate Park may pass through the area
predicted to experience 24-hour average concentrations above 0.1 25 ppm level but visitors
are not permitted to sperd 24 hours at a time in this area and the short-term exposures
are not such as to pose a threat to health.
Figure 3, Appendix 7.4 shows the predicted 1-year average concentrations. Sensitive
plants are reported to experience adverse impacts above a concentration of 0.1 ppm
(0.125 ppm at 80 per cent of sea-level pressure). Clearly there is the potential for
sensitive plants to show some affects within a few hundred metres of the East Olkaria
Power Station. However, the vegetation and flower trial studies (reported elsewhere) have
not revealed impacts due hydrogen sulphide. The effects on vegetation observed so far
appear to be due to del.berate actions such as grass cutting, or accidental fires and
accidentally introduced non-local plants, by construction equipment.
7-38



North East Olkaria4
Figure 4, Appendix 7.4, shows the predicted maximum 1-hour average concentrations.
The pattern of contours is quite different from the case of the East Olkaria Power Station.
This is because of the substantially higher plume rise that will occur with the new power
station. The maximum concentrations are associated with the high ground and the
maximum contour shown is 0.4 ppm. The highest predicted concentration is 1.12 ppm.
No residential areas except for part of X2-Camp and some Maasia bomas on the south
western and central southern boundary of Hell's Gate Park. are predicted to exceed the
Californian 1-hour average 0.04 ppm level, adjusted for 80 per cent sea-level pressure.
Comparison of Figures 1 and 4, Appendix 7.4, shows that the impact of the proposed
North East Power Station is far less than from the existing East Olkaria Power Station.
Figure 5, Appendix 7.4, shows the predicted 24-hour average concentrations for the North
East Power Station operating alone. No areas are predicted to be affected by 24-hour
average concentrations above the WHO 24-hour goal of 0.1 ppm (0.125 ppm at 80 per
cent atrnospheric pressure).
Figure 6, Appendix 7.4, shows the predicted annual average hydrogen sulphide emissions
due to North East Olkaria Power Station emissions. Nowhere do predicted concentrations
exceed that concentration at which sensitive plants show effects.
Cumulative effects of North East Olkaria and East Olkaria Power Stations
Figure 7.4.1 shows the predicted 1-hour maximum ground-level concentrations of
hydrogen sulphide. It is clear that the introduction of the North East Power Station has
almost no effect on the maximum 1-hour ground level concentrations experienced. The
impact assessment is the same as for the East Olkaria Power Station operating alone,
except that marginally higher concentrations are experienced on the high ground to the
east ancl southwest of the North East Power Station.
Figure 7.4.2 shows the maximum predicted 24-hour concentrations. Comparison with
Figure 2, Appendix 7.4, shows no significant change in predicted maximum 24-hour
concentrations except in the area to the east of the North East Power Station. The change
in the area to the south west apparent in the predicted 1-hour concentrations does not
show up in the 24-hour averages.
Figure 7.4.3 shows the predicted 1 -year average hydrogen sulphide concentrations. Again
the introduction of the North East Power Station is almost imperceptible except on the high
ground to the east of the North East Power Station, where concentrations will
approximately double (see area close to the North East Meteorological Station where
concentrations increase from a low value of 0.002 to a still low value of 0.004 ppm).
7.4.4.4 Impact assessment (predicted cumulative frequency distributions)
To evaluate fully the impact of odours from the power stations, it is necessary to examine
not only the maximum concentrations expected but also the frequency with which
particular concentrations are expected.  Figures 7.4.4, 7.4.5 and 7.4.6 show the
predictions for nine sites for the three cases; East Olkaria Power Station by itself, North
East Olkaria Power Station by itself and the two operating simultaneously. The grid
4 This case will be of minor significance because it Is planned that the two power stations will operate
together.

coordinates and elevations of the nine sites are listed in Table 7.4.3 and the sites are also
shown on Figure 6.6.1.
The discussion presented in this section will probably be the most useful method whereby
local residents will be able to assess the impact of the proposed power station. It allows
the existing level of impact to be compared with the future level.

Figure 7.4.4 is the predicted air quality for the existing situation. The figure shows how
many hours in the year a particular 30-minute concentration value will be exceeded at any
of the nine locations. On the right-hand axis are marked three odour levels: the 5 per cent
odour detection limit; the 50 per cent limit: and the 95 per cent limit. These are taken
from data presented by Nagy (1991) following tests of human response to odour
undertaken using two 9-person odour panels. The 5 per cent limit is the concentration at
which the most sensitive panellist was able to just detect an odour (but not necessarily
identify it), the 50 per cent limit is the concentration at which 50 per cent of the panel
could just detect the odour (presumably the more sensitive members experience an odour
stronger than the "just detectable") and the 95 per cent limit is the concentration at which
95 per cent of the panellists could at least detect the odour.
To use the graph, select a particular curve, for example Elsa Gate (existing situations) and
read from the curve how frequently a particular 30-minute concentration is exceeded. For
Elsa Gate the curve shows that the 50 per cent odour detection limit is exceeded for
7-43



approximately 108 hours5 in a year. That is if the 50 per cent-member of Nagy's odour
panel spent one year at Elsa Gate continually concentrating on detecting hydrogen sulphide
odours, then that person would be expected to report an odour on approximately 108
hours. That is slightly over two hours per week. The same person at X2-Camp would be
expected to report a detectable odour on approximately 1 654 hours per year. That is
approximately 32 hours per week.
This approach to the assessment may overstate the odour impacts because it does not
take into account the fact that exposure to hydrogen sulphide causes a rapid decrease in
sensitivity to the odour. Nor does it take into account the decreases in sensitivity that
occurs due to interference by common hydrocarbons and other odours. However, unless
an odour panel was selected from residents in the area the approach seems to be the best
available.
Nagy (1991) also supplies information on complaint levels from the odour panel studies.
The 5 per cent complaint level is 0.0017 ppm, the 50 per cent level is 0.016 ppm and the
95 per cent level 0.247 ppm. Thus clearly even at X2-Camp, the "worst-affected"
residential area, there would still be people for whom the concentration did not reach the
complaint level. The 50 per cent complaint level would be exceeded on approximately
1300 hours per year. That is 25 hours per week. Again these goals probably overstate
the impact because of the factors discussed above.
Figure 7.4.5 shows the predicted cumulative frequency curves for the proposed North East
Power Station operating by itself. The improved disposal method, namely discharging the
hydrogen sulphide in the cooling tower plume, will achieve much greater plume rise (see
Table 7.4.2) and the consequences for ground-level concentrations of hydrogen sulphide
are dramatic. The most sensitive noses at X2-Camp would be predicted to detect the
smell on only 609 hours in the year (about 37 per cent of the frequency due to the existing
Power Station which is substantially further away) and the least sensitive noses may never
detect the odour. This operating scenario will probabiy never occur so the curves are only
useful for determining the contribution that the North East Power Station will make.
Figure 7.4.6 shows that expected future operating case with both the East and North East
Power Stations operating together. Comparing Figure 7.4.4 and Figure 7.4.6 is probably
the best way to assess the impacts. It can be seen that the change in impact is generally
small, except at X2-Camp where the 50 per cent odour detection limit is predicted to be
exceeded 1 654 hours/year at present and 2280 hours/year with both stations operating.
This level of impact would be expected to apply also at KWS's Olkaria Gate. At the Elsa
Gate entrance to Hell's Gate National Park the number of "exceedances" rises from 110
hours/year to 11 2 hourslyear.
Table 7.4.4 summarises the number of times that the 50 per cent odour detection limit is
exceeded at each of the ten sites for the three cases examined.
The operation of the North East Power Station will make very little difference to the
incidence of odours in the area.
5 The predicted concentrations used in constructing the cumulative frequency curves are 30-minute
average concentrations. Only one 30-minute average is predicted for each hour of meteorological data. Thus
there are approximately E760 predictions of half-hour concentrations in the year.

7.4.5 Eimissions of Radioactive Gases
As discussed in Section 6.6, the data on radon emissions presented by Clarke et al.
(1990), shows that the radon-222 levels in the Olkaria area were in the range 255 to 3000
counts per minute. On the assumption that the maximum level would have been 5000
cpm and the voiume of the enamometer chamber was 250 ml and its efficiency was 1 00
per cent,, then the activity of the fumarole gas would be 3.3x105 Bq/m3. As discussed
earlier, radon-222 levels were found to be strongly correlated with carbon dioxide
concentrations and the carbon dioxide concentration that corresponded to the maximum
radon-222 level was 30.6 percent.
With this information, and the predicted maximum annual average hydrogen sulphide
concentrations presented in Section 7.4.4, it is possible to estimate the maximum ground-
level radon-222 level. This can be done by noting that hydrogen sulphide has been taken
to be four to five per cent of the non-condensable gas fraction of the geogas emission.
This results in a maximum ground-level concentration of hydrogen sulphide of 0.08 ppm
(annual average with both power stations operating). If the remainder of the geo gas
emission is taken to be carbon dioxide, then it is possible to estimate the radon-222 level
to be 0.08x10-6x(96/4)x(100130.6)x3.3x105, namely 2.1 Bq/m3. The EER radon-222
concentration will be less than this by a factor of at least two. Therefore the increase in
radon-222 concentration due to emissions from both power stations is likely to be of the
order of 1 Bq/m3, at the most-affected receptor. This is one percent of the WHO (1990)
guideline.
7-45



Thus power generation activities are not expected to have any significant effect on
radiation levels at Olkaria. However, it should be noted that this conclusion is,based on
assumptions, which although believed to be either realistic or conservative, are
nevertheless assumptions. In view of this, it is recommended that a program to measure
worker exposure to radiation should be undertaken.
7.4.6 Conclusions and Recommendations
Main findings
The air quality assessment has provided a description of the local environment, a
description of the project from the point of view of air quality and has reviewed data on
existing air quality. It has been based on the use of the AUSPLUME computer-based
dispersion model, local meteorological data and emissions data to predict ground-level
concentrations of emissions. Predictions have been made for three cases: the existing
situation where the East Olkaria Power Station operates by itself; the case when the
proposed North East station operates by itself; and the proposed future situation when the
East and North East Power Stations operate simultaneously.
Because of superior dispersion of emissions from the new power station, the introduction
of the new North East Power Station will have little effect on ground-level concentrations
of hydrogen sulphide.
The modelling studies show that there are no health risks due to hydrogen sulphide in the
ambient air, although there is an area, extending approximately 1000 m to the north of the
East Olkaria Power Station where the WHO 24-hour goal of 0.1 5 ppm may be exceeded
under "worst-case" days. This area is fenced and access to this area is already controlled.
The concentrations are well below occupational health standards.
Although no health impacts are predicted to occur, the model predicts that odours are
presently detectable over wide areas. The concentrations predicted when modelling the
existing situation exceed the more stringent of the internationally recognised air quality
goals but comply with the less stringent goals. The introduction of the North East Power
Station will make little change to the frequency or intensity of odours experienced in
residential areas except at KPC's X2-Camp (and the nearby KWS's Olkaria Gate) where the
incidence of odours is predicted to increase by 39 per cent.
Predicted annual average concentrations of hydrogen sulphide indicate that even sensitive
individuals are unlikely to be affected by either the existing power station, or the two
power stations taken together. Flower-growing trials and surveys of existing vegetation
have failed to identify any air pollution effects. However, it is recommended that the
vegetation monitoring program and flower growing trials should be continued for a further
three years after which the need for continued monitoring should be reviewed. The new
power station will cause an almost imperceptible increase in annual average ground-level
concentrations at the closest point in Oserian's flower growing areas. No impacts are
expected.
Thus on the basis that current air quality is acceptable, there should be no reason not to
allow the operation of the North East Power Station.
7-46



Recommendations
The following recommendations are made concerning air quality issues.
O     Residents in X2-Camp are predicted to experience a significant exposure to
odours. Ideally the camp should be moved to an area experiencing a lower
incidence of odours. However the shortage of accommodation in the area
means that it is likely that people would prefer the option of living at X2-
Camp, rather than uncertain alternatives.
o     Meteorological monitoring shouid be continued at the X2-Camp site.
O     One and preferably two continuous hydrogen sulphide monitors (with
logging equipment) should be established to monitor hydrogen sulphide
concentrations at the flower trial areas to the north of the East Olkaria
Power Station and at X2-Camp.
o     The cooperative flower trial studies with Oserian Development Company
should be continued until such times as Oserian Development Company are
satisfied that the sensitivity of their operations to hydrogen sulphide has
been determined. It would be useful if these studies were to establish the
threshold at which adverse effects begin to occur. This would be useful
information for KPC's future planning. It is envisaged that these studies
may need a further period of up to three years.
o     KPC's Environmental Unit at Olkaria should continue to develop its expertise
in dispersion modelling and air quality monitoring and to make use of
monitoring data to assess the performance of the dispersion model. This
enhancement in expertise will require overseas training or the use of outside
consultants with expertise in air quality matters, or a combination of both.
7.5 NOISE
7.5.1 lintroduction
Noise impacts have been assessed using a noise prediction model to estimate noise levels
that will occur in the neighbourhood of the power station and well field during the well
testing phase and during operation of the power station. The predicted noise levels have
been presented as contour plots showing the "maximum" predicted noise levels over the
area of interest. Discussion of noise impacts expected during the construction phase is
also presented. The following sections provide information on the method used to predict
noise levels, the environmental noise quality goals which are appropriate for this
environrnent and the expected impacts due to noise emissions.
7.5.2 Method of Predicting Noise Impacts
The computer-based model used in this study, has been developed for assessing the noise
impacts from mining and industrial sources. The model is referred to as NOISE4. The
principles by which the calculations are made, are similar to those used by most
consultants and regulatory agencies undertaking similar noise impact assessment work.
7-47



The model takes into account three major factors affecting noise propagation: namely the
diminution of noise level due to distance as the sound energy spreads outwards from the
source; the effects that natural and artificial barriers have on the sound, and the absorption
of sound energy by the atmosphere, where some of the vibrational energy of the sound
is converted to heat in the atmosphere. Some sound energy is absorbed by vegeation but
with elevated noise sources such as will apply for the power station this effect is expected
to be minor.
The first cause of diminution of sound level due to distance (see above) is due primarily
to geometric factors and is 6 dB each time the distance from the source to the receptor
is doubled. The effects of natural and artificial barriers depends on the frequency of the
sound and the geometry of the arrangement of the source, receptor and barrier. The
estimates of the reduction in noise level due to barriers has been calculated using a
procedure set out by Harris (1979). The absorption of noise in the atmosphere depends
primarily on the frequency of the sound and the temperature and humidity of the
atmosphere. The method used to account for atmospheric absorption is again taken from
Harris (1979) and the temperature and humidity assumed to apply was 10 °C and 90%
relative humidity. This combination of temperature and humidity corresponds to low
absorption and thus leads to generally conservative estimates of noise levels at distant
receptors.
For the model to operate, it requires data on sound power level and the tonal composition
of the emitted noises. This information has been determined by on-site measurement of
noise emissions from existing East Olkaria Power Station. These have been increased
appropriately by 1.3 dB to take into account the fact that the proposed North East Power
Station will be a 65 MWe Power Station compared with a 48 MWe for the present East
Olkaria Power Station.
Apart from noise from heavy earth-moving machinery required for site works during
construction, the only significant noise sources associated with the project are the noise
of wells under test; noise from the cooling tower complex; and noise from the gas ejectors
located, in the East Olkaria Power Station, on the main power station building. For the
North East Power Station the gas ejectors disposing of waste hydrogen sulphide will be
located inside the cooling towers. Because of the shielding afforded by the walls of the
cooling tower, this may well lead to lower noise emission levels than for the present power
station. However, in the absence of specific performance data for this arrangement, it has
been assumed that the sound power levels due to the North East Power Station gas
ejectors will have the same tonal composition and be 1.3 dB noisier than the East Olkaria
gas ejectors.
The model takes into account the three attenuating processes discussed above and
estimates the sound level at a user-specified grid of points covering the area of interest.
For the present study the grid points were spaced at 333.3 m and covered a rectangular
area 14.3 km in an east-west direction and 19.0 km in a north-south direction with the
southwest corner of the grid at 192 000 m East and 206 000 m North (see Figure 2.2.3)
The calculations are repeated for each source and the resultant noise level at each grid
point is determined by adding the contribution from all of the sources.
7.5.3 Environmental Noise Quality Criteria
The annoyance potential of noise in a particular environment depends on the tonal
7-48



composition of the noise, whether it is impulsive or not and the level by which the noise
exceeds the background level5. With the exception of reversing horns that may be used
on heavy earth-moving equipment during site preparation works the noise emissions from
the project in both the development and operational phase will be broad-band non-
impulsive noises. Under these circumstances it is possible to determine environmental
noise quality guidelines which can be used to protect communities against adverse noise
impacts.
In the present study the goals applied by the New South Wales (Australia) Environmental
Protection Authority (EPA) have been used. These are similar to the goals that are applied
throughout much of the western world and from discussions at the Technical
Environrnental Review Committee Meetings these are appropriate for use in Kenya. The
New South Wales goals are set out in the "Environmental Noise Control Manual" published
by the New South Wales EPA (1 985). The relevant information from the manual is set out
in the paragraphs below.
The first step in determining appropriate environmental noise quality goals is to establish
background noise levels in the area. Because of the well-testing program it was not
possible to determine representative background noise close to the proposed power station
site and measurements have been made in locations where the influence of noise
emissions from wells under test was negligible. Background noise levels in remote isolated
areas and in areas where noises from insects and frogs and the wind was low was
between 25 and 30 dB(A). Indeed most areas experienced background levels as low as
30 dB(A) from time to time. The NSW guidelines set acceptable background noise levels
for rural residences of 45 dB(A) in the day (7 am to 10 pm) and 35 dB(A) at night (10 pm
to 7 am,l. Thus the existing noise environment should be considered as satisfactory, but
because of the low background levels the potential for an intruding noise to annoy is higher
than it would be in a noisier environment. The NSW guidelines consider that in such
environnments (that is those with low background noise levels) the intruding noise is
acceptalble so long as the LAIO level from the intruding noise is less the greater of 5 dB(A)
above the existing background level, or 35 dB(A). Thus an appropriate environmental
noise quality goal is that LA10 due to operational noise from the power station should be
below 35 dB(A) at noise sensitive sites.
Experience has shown that model calculations made under the assumptions described
above will under some atmospheric conditions, namely with light winds blowing towards
the receptor and strong ground based inversions, underpredict noise levels at the receptor
by up to 20 dB(A). This type of meteorological condition would occur under calm night
time conditions with clear skies. This level of underprediction tends to occur at large
distances from the noise so although noise levels are higher than predicted they are still
very low' and below the level at which levels would be considered to be a nuisance.
7.5.4 Predicted Noise Levels and Impact Assessment
Noise During Well-Testing
Well-tesiting is a noisy operation where high pressure gas (mostly steam) from the well is
released to the atmosphere either through a silencer or directly to the atmosphere.
Measured noise levels at Well 716, which tested at 4.5 MWe, are presented in Section
6 The term background noise level as used in this report refers to the noise level exceeded for 90 per cent
of the period of interest. It is usually written as LA9o.
7-49



6.7. These show noise levels at 30 m from the well are in the range 95 to 100 dB(A).
The noise is best described as a roaring noise similar to a large jet engine. Generally three
wells are tested at a given time and the test period runs over three months during which
time the wells discharge continuously 24 hours a day.
Two other wells, Wells 714 and 709 were tested at 7.1 and 8.5 MWe respectively and
thus could be expected to be noisier than Well 716 by between 2 and 2.8 dB(A). Figure
7.5.1 shows the predicted noise level from Well 716, operated by itself. The figure shows
X2-Camp would have experienced noise levels between 45 and 50 dB(A) and the KWS
Olkaria Gate area would have experienced noise levels of approximately 47 dBMA). These
are above the 35 dB(A) limit and thus would not represent a satisfactory long-term
condition. No other residential areas would be expected to experience noise levels above
35 dB(A) and so adverse impacts are confined to the two locations.
Taking account of the noted propensity of the modelling procedure to under-predict noise
levels for distant receptors under certain meteorological conditions, (see Section 7.5.3) it
is relevant to note that it is possible that at distant locations such as Kongoni, noise levels
due to Well 716 under test would be perhaps 34 dB(A). Under quiet night time conditions,
the noise would be clearly audible above the background. If the effects of an additional
two hypothetical wells were to be taken into account, the noise levels would probably not
be significantly increased unless the wells had similar noise emission levels. If two
additional wells with the same noise emission level as Well 71 6 were to be tested at the
same location as Well 716, then the noise level would increase by 4.87 dB(A).
The results of modelling show that well testing has the capacity to cause adverse noise
impacts at X2-Camp and at the Olkaria Gate area. The limited duration of the well testing
program mitigates the impact, nevertheless for the well testing phase of the project,
adverse noise impacts will occur at these two sites.
Well testing will also affect the acoustical environment of other areas of the Hell's gate
National Park. In general, in day time conditions noise from well testing in the areas of the
park most used by visitors will not be noticed above background noise levels. At night
time the park is not open to visitors. However the camping area (4 km ENE of East Olkaria
Power Station) may be occupied by campers. Under light winds and inversion conditions,
noise from the well testing is audible and may be considered by some campers to detract
from the value of the camping experience. However noise levels will at all times be lower
than 35 dB(A) and may equally well be considered as an interesting feature of the area.
Given the limited duration of well testing this matter is not considered in further detail.
Construction Phase
The noisiest phase during construction will be when site works are being undertaken. This
work, which will span approximately 9 months, will involve the use of bulldozers, graders,
scrapers, front-end loaders, trucks and cranes. Work will be confined to daytime only 6
am to 5.30 pm. Noise will be clearly audible at X2-Camp (500 m NW of the site), at KWS'
Olkaria Gate 1 km to the NNW) and to workers in the neighbouring flower growing areas
on Oserian Developments flower growing land (1.2 km to the NNW). Given these
distances and the lack of night time operations, no adverse impacts are anticipated at any
7 The addition of noise levels follows a logarithmic rule. For example adding two identical noise levels
together increases the noise level that is produced by one of the sources by 3 dB (that is 1Olog10(2)l. If three
identical sources are added the level increases by 4.8 (that is 10log10(3)).

of the locations due to construction noise.
Operational Phase Noise
Predicted noise levels due to the existing East Olkaria and proposed North East Olkaria
Power Station are presented in Figure 7.5.2. X2-Camp is predicted to experience LA10
levels in the range 43 to 50 dB(A) and the Olkaria Gate area to experience a level of
approximately 38 dB(A). Thus X2-Camp is expected to experience a significant impact and
the Olkaria Gate area to experience a marginal impact.
Recommendations
The noise predictions are based on certain assumptions about noise emission levels from
the proposed power station. It is possible that noise emission levels from the new power
stations gas ejector system will be lower than assumed. However, it would appear
unlikely that noise levels below the target of 35 dB(A) will be achieved. If this is verified
by monitoring after commissioning of the power station, then the following
recommendations apply.
1.    Relocate X2-Camp to outside the 35 dB(A) contour operation noise
contour; and
2.    Monitor noise levels at the Olkaria Gate KWS residences and provide
acoustical treatment of these residences if the measured LA10 levels due to
the power station are above 35 dB(A) and if the affected residences request
such treatment.
No other areas are expected to experience noise levels that would justify mitigating actions
to be taken.
7.6 IMPACTS ON LAKE NAIVASHA
7.6.1  Introduction
The single source for all water abstraction is Lake Naivasha. This includes direct water
abstraction (eg drilling and housing estate) and indirect abstraction in the form of a
postulated "hydraulic-link" from the lake to the geothermal steamfield (i.e. the drawdown
of the steamfield would lead to a lowering of the lake). Both forms of impact are
discussed (Sections 7.6.2 and 7.6.3).
7.6.2   Direct Water Abstraction
A detailed discussion of the consumption by the registered users of water from Lake
Naivasha is provided in Section 6.8.3. A brief summary is presented here.
Information from the Water Bailiff of the Ministry of Water and Development, indicates
that there are currently 108 registered direct water abstractions from the Lake for a total
of 83340.3 m3/day or 30.4 x 106 m3/y. This figure represents 60% of the estimated
water storage (S) or outflow from the lake indicating that current water abstraction has
a significant influence on the water balance. However KPC is registered for only 2622.56
m3/day or 3.1% of the total comprising water taken from three intakes; one for Eburru,

another for Olkaria and North East Olkaria, and the final smaller intake for the housing
estate. KPC is the eighth largest abstracter, the two largest abstracters accounting for
virtually a third of the total on their own. In addition the amount of water used by KPC
will substantially diminish once drilling is completed. This is in contrast to other water
abstracters who primarily use the water for irrigation and are more likely to increase their
usage. It was therefore concluded that in terms of possible impact on the lake level
because of water abstraction, KPC would not be a primary cause.
An independent estimate of water usage was also undertaken, based on power
consumption. This indicated that direct water abstraction is probably almost double the
licensed amount, however the usage by KPC still remains at 3% of the total.
Malewa Dam Development
As discussed in Section 6.8.3, the Malewa Dam project has the potential to impact
significantly on lake levels, which in turn could affect abstraction by current users
including KPC. In view of the potential for adverse impacts, the ability of Lake Naivasha
to sustain the proposed water abstraction levels, will be the subject of a full environmental
study.
7.6.3  Indirect Water Abstraction.
The issue of indirect water extraction, centres around a hydraulic link between the lake and
the geothermal field. However, this issue has yet to be resolved. A detailed discussion
of the evidence for the link in provided in Section 6.8.4. A brief summary of that evidence
is presented here.
The data do not entirely support the notion of a link. On the contrary, a poorly permeable
unit (aquiclude) underlies the lake, separating it from the dual steam and hot-water zones
of the Olkaria field. A secondary, but significant, feature is the series of shallow, perched,
unconfined aquifers on top of the aquiclude, which are found in numerous drill holes. The
perched aquifers appear to be in direct hydraulic continuity with Lake Naivasha but not the
deeper geothermal system.
Some support for a hydraulic link has been put forward on the basis of isotope evidence
(Clarke et al., 1990), where it appears the geothermal reservoir is a mixture of about 40%
to 50% lake water. The lake water is identified by its relatively heavy oxygen and
hydrogen isotopes (resulting from solar evaporation of ponded water) compared to the
relatively light water of meteoric origin occurring as groundwater from the Rift margin.
For this lake water to originate in modern Lake Naivasha, it is necessary to postulate a
fairly unrealistic system in which lake water percolates vertically downward for several
kilometres, becomes heated, then returns to within a few hundred metres of the surface
as geothermal fluid, only a few kilometres distant from its point of descent. An alternative
hypothesis is that the Olkaria reservoir does indeed contain a high percentage of
evaporated lake water but that this water originates not from present-day Lake Naivasha,
but from ancient lakes known to have formed and evaporated over the millennia of Rift
Valley history.
The resolving of the extent and magnitude of any hydraulic link still awaits further and
more detailed study. However, in order to provide some assessment on the potential
impact that could occur, a "worse-case" scenario was assumed. That is, that a direct link
7-54



did occur.
Preliminary estimates of subsurface flows from the Naivasha catchment suggest that the
amount contributed by Lake Naivasha is around 50 x 1 06 m3/y (which is 20% of the total
recharge estimated by a previous water balance study). Flow to the south via relatively
shallow aquifers may be the most significant route for water flow from the catchment
(Clarke et al., 1990).
The average well at Olkaria is estimated to produce about 6 kg/s of steam, equivalent to
around 2.5 MWe. Therefore in order to produce 45 MWe, the present wellfield discharges
approxirnately 1 00 kg/s of steam, equivalent to a liquid discharge rate of approximately
3 x 1 or m3/y. This is only a small proportion of even the minimum estimated total natural
southerly flow from the Naivasha area (41 x 106 m3/y). With the North East Olkaria (64
MWe) development, reinjection is to be practised and it is also proposed to reinject at the
existing Olkaria field. Assuming that this will occur, consumption would stay at about 4
x 1 o6 m3/y or less tran 1 C% of the minimum Lake Naivasha underflow calculated for the
region.
Therefore, even assuming -he "worst-case", namely that 100% of the water released by
the wells is derived directly from the Lake, it is concluded that the impact of the steamfield
on the lake level will not tb major.
7.6.4 'Summary of Likely Impacts
The amount of lake wate' drawn by the existing geothermal project and the proposed
development has been snown to be a small proportion of the total amount of water
abstract:ed. On its o.vn therefore it is unlikely to affect the lake level significantly. Indirect
abstraction via a possible nydraulic link between t-he Lake and the wells is also unlikely to
have a major impac:.
Historically water-levels a: Lake Naivasha fluctuate significantly and it is likely that they
will continue to do so. It s important to consider that over the expected 30-year life of
the proposed power staticn, there are likely to be periods when the lake level is very low.
KPC should therefore not rely on the lake as a source of water for the entire life of the
well. Contingency plans should be made for alternative water sources for drilling and
domestic purposes when the need arises.
7.7 WATER DISPOSAL
A 64 MWNe geothermal de, -lopment produces a substantial amount of waste-water, which
needs to be disposed of safely without adverse effects on the environment. Previous
methods of disposal via cullies and natural draininge lines, have led to significant soil
erosion. The proposed lorg-term method of waste-water disposal is by deep reinjection,
which should have minimal surface impact.
The disposal of gecvherrmal waste waters poses a problem because the fluid is a brine
containing chemicals in cc,.ncentrations that are potentially harmful to both flora and fauna.
A 64 MWe development produces a substantial volume of waste water, all of which needs
to be disposed of safely. T he preferred option for waste brine disposal during steamfield
operation and that recorrmended in the feasibility report, is for deep reinjection into a
number of purpose drilled ^r unused production wells and this option is to be implemented.
7-55



The impact of this disposal option and temporary brine disposal options during the
construction phase of the development are assessed.
A detailed discussion of the well water quality and potential impacts is presented in
Section 6.9.2. Although by world standards the brine is not particularly toxic, it poses a
health risk and needs to be disposed of in a safe manner. The elements of most concern
are fluoride and lead.
Waste-water disposal is required during all phases of the project cycle, however the
original practise of disposal into gullies and natural drainage lines, led to serious erosion.
This form of impact has been assessed and discussed in an earlier section. The present
system for water disposal was initiated recently by KPC and involves piping all brine from
wells being tested into a collection pond and then gravity reinjecting. A similar activity has
been initiated for drilling waste-water.
During the long term commissioned phase of the project. the geothermal brine will be
disposed of by deep reinjection. The level of reinjection will be below lake level and there
is little possibility of surface or groundwater pollution. The problem of pipe blockages due
to precipitation of dissolved silica will be overcome by the use of conditioning ponds. The
proposed development will mean about 700 t/h will need to be reinjected. The large ponds
adjacent to the station will probably attract wildlife during extended dry periods and
therefore need to be securely fenced.
One advantage of the fact that the brine will have been cooled, is that the reinjection line
can be buried. This is recommended so that the pipeline does not become a barrier to
wildlife movement, particularly since the proposed reinjection wells lie some distance from
the production field wells.
Summary of Likely Impacts
Previous methods of waste-water disposal into gullies and natural drainage lines have led
to unacceptable levels of soil erosion. The current and proposed techniques of reinjection
will not cause any significant impacts at the surface and are sufficiently deep that there
is little possibility of groundwater contamination.
7.8 SOCIO-ECONOMICS
7.8.1 Introduction
For the purpose of assessing social and economic impacts, two areas have been
considered. The first is referred to as the primary impact area, which includes the Hell's
Gate National Park and the adjoining land to the north, which may experience direct effects
due to the project, either due to being able to see the development, experience odours or
hear noise from the project. Because of variability in the direct impacts as the dispersion
conditions change, or as noise propagation conditions change, it is not possible to define
these areas precisely. However, beyond a distance of three to four kilometres from the
proposed power station, the direct effects are expected to be minimal. The secondary
impact area includes a much wider area where other social and economic effects may be
experienced. This has been taken to include the Naivasha Location (940 km2).
Further, in assessing the impacts of the proposal the two stages of the project have been
7-56



included. These are construction and operation. The exploration phase has not been
considered in any detail because tris stage is essentially complete at this time.
Decommissioning is also only discussed very briefly as the precise nature of this phase is
not known nor indeed is the environment in which it will take place.
The consultants' findings on anticipated impacts and appropriate mitigating measures
throughout all sectors follow a broad theme of provision of the required facilities by the
project, rather than relying on Naivasha town and the facilities of the Municipality. This
is because, as reported in the baseline study, Naivasha town and its environs has
witnessed very rapid population growth over the last ten years. Recent estimates suggest
an annual growth of around 1 0 per cent for the town itself and around 6 per cent for the
surrounding rural areas, have been sustained for most of the 1 980s. While many
employers around the lake have provided housing, schooling and other facilities for their
employees, some have not and those that have, do not provide for the large number of
casual workers who gravitate to the area.
This effect, compounded by very little development in the Municipality itself in recent
years, has lead to a situation where the infrastructure of Naivasha town is stretched far
beyond capacity. Social services are inadequate, as are health, education, water and
community facilities. Apart from a few small projects, no systematic development has
taken place for many years in the public housing sector and private development has been
limited and largely unplanned. The impact of the unplanned population increase is visible
throughout the municipality. The roads are in a parlous state and even major residential
areas are either not served at all by roads, or the roads are no longer in a condition fit for
vehicular traffic. With a rapidly growing informal sector, building kiosks and workshops
along the smaller streets, both suburban dwellers and business people complain of frequent
water shortages.
The consultants have studied the Municipality development plans and have held
discussions with local officials, as well as residents and business people. The clear
conclusion is that any major project in the Naivasha area, including the Olkaria geothermal
project, is advised, both in its own interests as well as the Municipality's, not to put any
further burdens on the infrastructure of Naivasha town. The approach will have to be one
of self-sufficiency within the project area.
The consultants recommend that provided adequate steps are taken, as indicated here, in
the area of infrastructure and social facilities, and provided a joint planning approach
continues between KWS and KPC for the optimum management of hell's Gate National
Park, the socio-economic aspects of the project will not cause undue concern.
7.8.2 Construction
The following socio-economic aspects have been examined:
Impact on Population
The total peak workforce during the Main Civil Works and Power Station, High Voltage
sub-stations, High Voltage Transmission line and Steamfield Development Construction is
estimated to be 920. The total period will be two years.
The expected labour requirement by skill level are listed in Table 7.8.1. The numbers are
7-57



as follows:

Total Peak                      920             575             345
Five hundred and seventy five staff are expected to be drawn from people already living
in the area. Thus the total number of people affected will be approximately 2 875 people
including an estimated four dependents per worker. This may be compared with the
estimated 48 000 people living south of the lake or within the 40 000 in Naivasha town.
Three hundred and forty five are expected to be recruited into the area from outside.
Taking an average household size of three, this represents around 1035 additional people,
coming into a south-of-the-take population of some 48 000, an increase of 2 per cent.
The existing KPC project has on site 687 people, of whom 1 50 are generation staff
(Olkaria East Power Station) and 537 fall under the Development Operations (drilling,
scientific, civil, safety, training, personnel, administration, finance staff). The requirement
during construction phase, on average, will be roughly comparable to the existing
workforce.
In terms of absolute numbers, the infiux is relatively little compared with the increase of
over 5 per cent per annum in population over the last few years. However, the impact on
the socio-economics of the area will be significant, and is reviewed in the following
paragraphs.
Local Economy
The construction phase will bring in 345 salaried staff into the area, with commensurate
local spending power. Most spending is expected in the shops south of the lake, and will
provide paid employment for a further 575 staff already in the area. Given the relatively
low wage employment in Naivasha urban area of around 5 000 in a population of at least
40 000, the project will contribute around a 1 2 per cent increase in employment, a
significant positive impact. The gross income for the project staff at peak level will be in
excess of KShs 4.9 million per month.
Given that the earnings in urban Naivasha were around KShs 100 million/annum in 1988,
this represents a significant increase in local spending power. This will in turn give rise to
a commensurate increase in roadside trading, which expanded following the introduction
7-58



of the upgraded Moi South Lake Road and the flower farms. It v.'ill also produce a
temporcry increase in the demand for transport into Naivasha. Much of the temporary
economic boost will however be felt not in the project area, but in the various districts
from which the immigrant workers will come. The pattern is for such workers to remit
home a substantial portion of their earnings to their family to pay school fees and assist
wives in the running of their subsistence farms. Thus the multiplier effect may not be as
great as would occur if the spending was confined to the Naivasha area.
Impact on Housing
The existing KPC X2-Camp is expected to experience an increase in hydrogen sulphide
odour and noise levels as a result of the proposed development. The existing levels, while
not exceeding workplace goals, are sufficient to cause a nuisance and any increase will
exacerbate the problem. The camp is therefore considered to be unsuitable for the existing
300 resident employees as well as the additional 345 strong construction workforce.
X2-Camp will therefore need to be relocated. in order to minimise disturbance in Hell's
Gate National Park, the new housing camp will have to be located outside the Park
boundaries. This is consistent with the Park management strategy adopted by KWS and
with widely accepted management practices for national parks. The site should be
restored to a condition satisfactory to KWS.
The selected contractor will have two options for housing arrangements fcr the
construction workers, namely:
O     to negotiate a local arrangement for a camp with neighbouring property
owners.  A suitable option would have been to approach Oserian
Development Company Ltd. However, Oserian have recently expanded their
operations to the extent that they may not be able to provide such facilities,
and other neighbouring property owners will need to be consulted.
o     to house the workers in or around Naivasha town and then arrange for their
daily transportation to and from the site. In the latter case baseline studies
have shown that there is a severe housing shortage in Naivasha.  In
addition, health, education, water and social services are already inadequate
for the existing population.
In view of the above, the better option for the contractor would be to enter into
negotiations with neighbouring property owners on site. Regarding the remaining 100
employees consisting of 30 administrative staff in the contractors' and consultants' offices
and 70 supervisory staff made up of consultants and contractor engineers, additional
housing will need to be provided at the KPC housing estates. However, not all the 70
supervisory staff will be present throughout the construction period, but only during the
particular contract programs.
There is potential for the building of additional senior staff houses at the Lake Side housing
estate which currently has 65 houses of which 24 are for senior staff and 41 are for
technicians. At the same time, KPC has allocated an area near Lake View estate from the
development of additional junior and senior staff housing. This area, originally ear-marked
for the development of a second tree nursery, in addition to that at the Lake Side estate,
is adequate for the additional permanent housing requirements of not more than 100
houses during construction phase.
7-59



Water and Sewage
Water
The biggest impact during construction will be on the additional 245 strong workforce to
be housed at X2-Camp or re-located KPC camp. Already there are 300 people at X2-
Camp. Considering water requirements of 60 litres per day person and assuming that 1 0
per cent of the additional workforce will bring a wife and child, the additional water
requirement will be 1 7 700 litres per day, which basically doubles the existing requirement
of 1 8 000 litres per day.
At present raw water is tapped from the new water supply line and passes through a
water treatment plant on the X2-Camp site. Potable water is pumped from this plant to
a storage tank at a high elevation in the nearby hillside which feeds the camp site.
Contractors' water demand would need to be examined to confirm the above proposed
requirements which will have to be provided at the contractors' expense.
At the KPC estate, water is currently pumped from the lake to a raw water tank. The raw
water then passes through a treatment plant and then via 6" pipe to elevated water tanks
at both the KPC housing estates. The water supply to the housing estates is considered
to be just enough for the existing population. Further expansion of the housing estates will
entail expansion of the existing storage facilities by installing larger water tanks.
KPC plans to provide the option of both raw water as well as treated water to the housing
estates, in a bid to limit tne use of treated water to only those situations where it is
necessary, thus reducing .ne strain on the existing water treatment facility.
Sewage
The existing sewage facilities at X2-Camp will not be adequate to cater for the increased
workforce. Some of the existing facilities could be utilised and additional facilities eg
toilets will have to be builz and maintained by the Contractors. The consultants strongly
recommend that separate facilities be constructed for the additional workforce and their
families.
Schools
It has been demonstrated that there is a severe shortage of schooling facilities in Naivasha
town. During the construction phase, it is expected that 100 administrative staff and
supervisory staff will have with them an average of 2 young children per family. The older
children are expected to be left to continue with their primary/secondary education
wherever they are. From the estimated total number of 200 young children expected to
accompany the staff, it is estimated the 50 per cent will be below school-going age.
The existing Mvuke Primary School has a total of 403 pupils of which 324 or 78 per cent
are children of KPC employees. The Standard One and Two classes have two streams
each while Standard Three to Eight have only one stream. The total number of teachers
in the Primary School is nine.
During the construction phase it is envisaged that there will be minimal requirement for
additional primary school facilities since it is expected that a majority of the construction
staff will choose to allow their primary school-going children to continue studies at their
existing school. However provision for the expansion of the primary School will have to
be made for the operating staff during the Operation Phase.
7-60



The existing Mvuke Nursery School has a total of 1 26 pupils all of whom are children of
KPC employees, and three full-time teachers. During the construction phase, 25 per cent
of the ernployees are expected to have at least one nursery school age child. Taking into
account a 5 per cent per annum increase in population, there will be an added requirement
for 100 nursery school places. KPC will therefore need to expand its existing Nursery
School by almost 100 per cent.
The consultants have noted however, that KPC has already put into place plans for
expansion of the existing schooling facilities. KPC have purchased 14 acres of land near
the existing schools to cater for the expansion of both the primary and nursery schools.
Health
Although KPC has its own health centre at Olkaria - besides those of Sulmac Ltd and
Oserian Development Company Ltd - the influx of 920 people during the construction
phase, is; expected to create heavy pressure on this existing facility. Substantial additional
health facilities will need to be provided for basic out-patient services.  It is the
consultants' recommendation that KPC double the existing facility to cater for this very
substantial influx.
The existing KPC dispensary caters for an average of 600 cases/month. There is a full-
time clinical officer and two nurses. In addition, a doctor visits the dispensary twice a
week.  In view of the expected increased demand for medical facilities, KPC are
considering the idea of upgrading the existing dispensary into a fully-fledged hospital.
This step will also reduce transport costs. costs of purchasing drugs from other sources
and costs incurred when patients are referred to other hospitals for specialised treatment.
The consultants also recommend that a routine health monitoring program be set up at the
onset of the construction phase. This program will assist in alleviating some of the
misconceptions about the effect of the geothermal power plant emissions on the health
of people in the area.
Impact on Roads and Transport
The movement of heavy earth-moving machinery and construction equipment will not have
any major impact on the physical condition of the Moi South Lake Road because this
machinery will be transported to site on wheel loaders and will remain on site until
completion of the construction activities.  However, providing that an active road
maintenance program is in place, this road will not require upgrading since it has been
constructed to international standards.
From the workforce of 920, about 575 or 62.5 per cent are expected to commute to and
from the power station site. Transportation could be provided by the selected contractor
using lorries/buses, or by public means that is buses and matatus. In the latter case the
demand on public transport will call for a doubling of the existing capacity, representing
a 22 per cent increase in total motorised vehicular traffic. However, given the very low
traffic levels reported in the baseline study, this increase will not create a problem.
In addition to vehicular traffic, the number of pedestrians is also expected to rise
substantially. During the baseline tourist survey it was noted that 17 per cent of the
tourists visiting Hell's Gate National Park entered the park via the Olkaria Gate. Tourists,
construction workers, KWS personnel and KPC staff who will be travelling on foot stand
7-61



a higher risk of road accidents. The consultants recommend that safety measures be
incorporated to safeguard pedestrians against such accident. The safety measures would
include:
o     clear and frequent road signs along the road alerting all road users of KPC
activities in the area;
o     zebra-crossings at appropriate places;
o     side railings along the road to separate vehicular traffic from pedestrians;
o     construction of a bicycle path to cater for the high number of cyclists;
o     clear speed limit indications for all vehicles both outside and within the
National Park.
Impact on Tourism
This is the area that need not be of great concern if all the necessary measures are taken.
The biggest probable impact during this stage may be the discouragement of tourists
visiting the park through the Olkaria Gate by the very presence of construction activities
just inside the park.
Close dialogue between KPC and KWS is necessary to work out a strategy whereby the
new power station, although designed to be more aesthetically pleasing, does not create
a deterrent to tourism.
As proved during the tourist survey carried out during the baseline studies, there is no
evidence that the presence of a geothermal power station is putting foreign tourists off
visiting the National Park. In fact, Kenya being one of the few countries in the world with
such a facility, the Geothermal Power Station could be used to attract more tourists to the
area thus generating more foreign exchange. In order to achieve this however, there is the
need to change the existing perceptions about the Hell's Gate National Park. It is
suggested that the park be designated into two areas, namely the Geothermal zone and
the National Park zone, so as to clearly distinguish options for visitors to the area. This
zoning will enable the joint KPC-KWS management to issue different sets of rules and
regulations pertaining to the two different zones. This strategy will strengthen the concept
of the peaceful coexistence of the two and promote the concept of sustainable
development.
Impact on the Maasai
As discussed in Section 6.10, the power station development and operation interact very
little with the Maasai. The major interaction is that the power station provides a reliable
supply of water. At present the Maasai living close to the boundary of the park make use
of this water to supplement their other supplies of water. The Maasai also have the
potential to interfere with the security of power station facilities such as equipment,
fencing etc. This is a matter that is presently handled by KPC taking normal security
precautions. These will inevitably be defeated at times, but it is recommended that KPC
continue with its present policy of regular consultation with the Maasai leaders, who are
met with during the Hell's Gate National Park Management Committee meetings. With this
channel for communication and the spirit of cooperation between KPC and the Maasai that
presently exists it is unlikely that major difficulties will develop.
7-62



One area in which some consideration should be given is the indirect impact that could
occur if geothermal development within Hell's Gate National Park results in KWS needing
additional areas. Expansion of the park to the west or north is not feasible because of
existing significant land development. Any expansion of the park to the south or east to
"compensate" for geothermal development activities within the park would impact on
Maasai who presently use this area. Even though these settlements are within Nakuru
District and not Narok District (see Figure 6.10.7), there would be a displacement of
families, who may have no firm legal rights of occupation, but who would require
alternative areas in which to live.
The Narok District between the southern boundary of Hell's Gate National Park and Suswa
presently shows signs of poor vegetative cover as a result of grazing and in dry periods
there is significant wind erosion of the top soil. The capacity of this area to accept
additional people living a traditional pastoralist life-style should be examined in detail if
geotherrnal development should indirectly cause people to be displaced from the land they
presently use.
Impact on Recreational Facilities
The influx of an additional 1035 people into the area will impact on the existing
recreational facilities because these facilities will not be able to cater for the expanded
population. The existing recreational facilities consist of:
o     a Senior Staff recreational facility consisting of a converted three-bedroom
house at the Lake Side housing estate. This facility has a television, a small
swimming pool, and provision for indoor games;
o     a Junior Staff Social Hall located at X2-Camp which has a television, a
music system and provision for indoor games, and;
o     a football field that is well used and popuiar to the extent that it is
frequently utilised for National League matches.
The consultants recommend that both the existing Senior Staff and Junior Staff facilities
be upgraded and expanded.
7.8.3 Operation
Impact on Population
The worlkforce during the operation phase of the project is expected to be around 11 3
people oir 75 per cent of the existing East Olkaria Power Station generation staff. Many
of the existing staff at the Olkaria East Power Station will take up additional duties at the
new North East Olkaria Power Station. The additional 11 3 employees, will represent an
influx of 565 people, taking an average household size of five. This is an increase of 1 per
cent in the projected South-of-the-lake population of 53 280, and represents 55 per cent
of the influx of people during the construction phase.
Impact on Local Economy
The operation phase will bring 113 permanent salaried staff into the area with
commensurate spending power with the shops south of the lake.
7-63



The gross income for the operating staff at peak level will be in excess of KShs 390 000
per month representing annual earnings of KShs 4.7 million.
Impact on Housing
The following tables give an overview of the housing situation. Table 7.8-2 sets out the
status of the existing housing and Table 7.8-3 the proposed housing arrangements when
the North East Olkaria Power Station is commissioned.

The consultants therefore recommend that 113 additional permanent houses be
constructed to cater for the additional 100 administrative supervisory staff to be housed
during the construction phase, who will be replaced by 11 3 people drawn partly from the
same group and partly from outside the area.
7-64



Impact on Water and Sewerage
The existing KPC housing estates use water from Lake Naivasha. The current water
capacity will not be adequate to cater for the additional housing and the occupants. The
consultants concur with Ewbank Preece Limited regarding the provision of water for the
additional population namely:
The existing water reticulation system at the housing estates area will have to be reviewed
for upgrading and increasing the capacity for the additional housing and their occupants.
The new scheme will depend upon the layout of the new housing. A possible scheme
would be for the water from Lake Naivasha to be pumped to a new treatment works and
elevated storage tank at the top of the high ground at the site with water supplied to the
houses under gravity. At the new treatment works particular attention will be paid to
improving the quality of the water from the lake to reduce the high fluoride content.
Excessive fluoride intake can cause adverse effects on teeth and bones, particularly in
young children.
Regarding the water requirements at the power station, provision for a branch water
pipeline has been made by Ewbank Preece Limited in their feasibility study where it is also
stated that a potable water treatment plant will be provided with distribution within the
station via a pipe network.
Designs for adequate provision of sewage facilities have also been incorporated by Ewbank
Preece in their report.  All sewage will pass through a conventional septic tank
arrangement with the foul water discharging into a soakway.  The solids will be
periodically collected by the Naivasha Town Council. With these provisions no impacts are
expectead.
Impact on Schools
KPC have existing Primary and Nursery Schools at the Lake View housing estate catering
for children of the operating staff at the Olkaria East Power Station. It is estimated that
the operating staff of the new station will bring in about 295 nursery school going children
and 590 primary school going children.8
The consultants recommend that the new nursery school to be built to cater for the
additional 100 children during the construction phase, be designed for more capacity to
accominodate an additional 1 95 children during the operational phase. Secondly, the
existing primary school will need to be expanded to cater for 590 additional children, that
is more streams be introduced per class.
Impact on Health
The consultants consider that the facilities established during the construction phase of
the project will adequately cater for the operating staff, and with the proposed monitoring
prograrn in place, should provide sufficient out-patient services.
Impact on Roads and Transport
The volume of traffic generated by construction activities will be considerably reduced.
8 Although the employees housed at the KPC Estates will nave at feast one nursery school age child and
two primary school age children, and that 10% of employees noused at X2 Camp will have the same number
of school-going children (X2 camp actually has bachelor status but it is expected that the employees will have
families with them, as is the existing case tor Olkana East)
7-65



However, the volume of KrC vehicles. private vehicles, tourist vehicles, matatus and buses
is expected to increase due to increased activity in the area. KPC at present have two
buses which make two trips per day between the existing power station and Naivasha
providing transport for the 1 63 operating staff at the existing power station, who live in
Naivasha. The new power station will call for the acquisition of an additional two buses
to cope with the increased population. The same basic safety measures should be put into
place as during construction.
For the duration of the period of construction, there will be intermittent disruption of traffic
due to heavy construction machinery but due to the width of Moi South Lake Road and
the current sparse traffic rate of two KPC vehicles per hour, no major disruption is
envisaged.
It is expected that during the operation phase, the volume of traffic due to KPC vehicles
will increase by 100 per cent representing 8.5 per cent of the total vehicular traffic on Moi
South Lake Road. The increase in volume of traffic due to KPC vehicles is thus not
expected to impact significantly in terms of damage to the Moi South Lake Road.
Impact on Tourism
The Geothermal Project on the whole will have a positive impact on tourism, for reasons
stated earlier. However, the critical factor in ensuring that the project will have a positive
influence on tourism and hence the economy of the country, will be the close collaboration
between KPC and KWS in their commitment to environmental conservation.  The
consultants wish to report that as a result of deliberations at a senior management levels
of KWS and KPC, and detailed discussions at working leveis during Hell's Gate National
Park Management Committees a special collaborative joint KWS-KPC committee was
initiated in August 1991.  The objectives of the Wildlife Conservation/Geothermal
Exploration and Development Committee is to work out a joint management strategy
regarding present and future geothermal development and its effect on the environment
of Hell's Gate National Park. Membership of the committee is composed of:
o     Chairman - Assistant Director (Planning) KWS;
o     Member - Ceothermal Development Coordinator, KPC;
o     Member - Superintendent of Operation, KPC;
o     Member - Geothermal Development Manager. KPC:
o     Member - Warden, Hell's Gate National Park, KWS;
o     Member - Adviser to KPC Geothermal Development Project;
o     Member - Provincial Wildlife Officer, Nakuru, KWS;
o     Member - Environmental Officer, KPC, and;
o     Member - Resource Planner, KWS.
To date, two meetings have taken place on 14 February 1992 and 25 February 1992, the
latter one on site. Specific issues discussed so far have included:
7-66



o     rehabilitation of abandoned well pad sites;
o     an agreement for joint discussion on future road designs for the benefit of
both geothermal development and tourism;
o     an action plan for rehabilitation measures on abandoned well sites in North
East Olkaria:
o     an action plan on rehabilitation of sites that had infrastructure no longer in
use;
o     action on undesirable roadside weeds;
o     housing for construction workforce during the construction of the North
East Olkaria Power Station:
o     joint participation in the development of the community in the area, and:
o     appropriate security measures for visitors to the Park;
The consultanst recommend that this important dialogue continues throughout the life of
the project so that appropriate measures can be taken to offset any negative impacts and
enhance the positive ones.
Impact on the Maasai
As for the construction phase, no impacts are envisaged on the Maasai because there are
no Maasai in the Nattonal Park.
Impact on Recreational Facilities
The recreational facilities recommended for the construction phase will be adequate to
cater for the KPC employees and families during the operations phase. The increased
population in the area is expected to create an increase in number of visitors to hotels
along Moi South Lake Road namely Lake Naivasha Hotel, Safariland Hotel, Crescent Island
Tented Camp, YMCA. Fisherman's Camp and Elsamere Conservation Centre.
7.8.4 Mitigating Measures and Recommendations
One of thie most significant environmental impacts of the proposed development from a
socio-economic perspective is the presence of a full-time residential workforce within the
Park. This is not consistent with good environmental management of national parks, nor
is it consistent with the approach adopted by KWS in moving the Maasai out of the Park.
In addition, the ambient concentrations of hydrogen sulphide already experienced at the
X2-Camp, while not at an acutely toxic level are such that chronic effects may occur. The
present levels do not exceed workplace goals, but irritation of the respiratory system and
the eye may be experienced if individuals are exposed for longer periods. It is therefore
strongly recommended that there be no residential camps located within the park
boundaries.
7-67



The following is a list of recommendations for the management of the impacts of the
proposed development:
1.    X2-Camp or re-located KPC camp will need to be expanded to accommodate
additional 245 employees. It is recommended that this accommodation be
located outside the Park.
2.    220 additional permanent houses will have to be built at the estate. It has,
in the past, been suggested by KPC that some of the existing Junior staff
houses be demolished to provide land for two or three storey flats.
3.    The additional water requirement at X2-Camp will have to be catered for by
increasing the existing water supply. At the same time, the existing supply
at the estates should be upgraded and capacity increased.
4.    Additional sewage facilities will be required both at X2-Camp and the
estates housing.
6.    KPC will need to acquire 2 more staff buses.
7.    The present KPC-KWS committee should continue to meet at regular
intervals during all the phases of the Geothermal Development.
8.    KPC should renovate and expand the existing recreational club and upgrade
its indoor games facilities. In addition, a new football pitch should be built.
9.    Adequate road safety measures should be put in place, after joint KPC-KWS
discussions, to ensure the safety of KPC and KWS employees and visitors
to the Hell's Gate National Park.

7.9 POWER TRANSMISSION LINES
The impact assessment presented here is confined to the area within Hell's Gate National
Park and the immediate neighbourhood. The assumptions as to the route and mode of
construction are based on the information on the power transmission line provided in the
feasibility report (Ewbank Preece 1989). Minor deviations from the information would not
change the assessment. Impacts beyond the park can be inferred from the discussion, but
a detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this study.
In general power transmission lines have the potential to cause a range of environmental
effects as follows:
cl    visual impacts
ci    soil erosion
Co    fire hazard
co    effects due electromagnetic radiation
oi    noise
ci    hazards to aircraft.
The feasibility study (Ewbank Preece 1989) sets out the general principles that should be
followed in designing the line and selecting the route. Consideration of these principles
will ensure that impacts are kept to acceptable levels. Specific effects are discussed
below in the context of the power transmission line requirements for North East Olkaria.
Visual effects
The routes of existing and proposed transmission lines are shown in Figure 5.3.6. The
design of the line has taken account of visual impacts and has adopted an appropriate
comprornise between engineering requirements and visual impact. A short 4 km 132 kV
line is to be constructed between the existing East Olkaria Power Station and the proposed
North East Power Station and a 220 kV line will carry power to Nairobi. The impacts of
the new 1 32 kV power transmission line will be similar to those due to the existing line,
which are acceptable. The new 220 kV line will be larger and will follow a different route.
It will aclopt a basic span of approximately 370 m. Each tower will be approximately 25
m high aind will be constructed of galvanised steel, which will weather to a dull light grey
with time. It is proposed trhaT conductors be made of blue/grey insulators to reduce visual
impacts.
These colours are suitable for the Olkaria environment and the existing power lines blend
in well aind are generally do not form a significant part of the visual environment except
from viewing points which allow the towers to be viewed against the sky as the power
line crosses ridges. The route of the transmission line within the park has been reviewed
and it will not affect any areas with high scenic value such as the gorge area.  After
leaving the park the route initially will run northeast before turning to the east and joining
the existing 132 kV line to Nairobi (see Figure 5.3.6). From the northern side of the
transmission line (eg on the Moi South Lake Road) it will be visible against the hills near
the northern boundary of the park and the Elsa Gate entrance to the park. However, this
is a developed area with many houses and agricultural buildings already forming a
significant part of the landscape. The existing power line follows a similar route. The
visual impact of the new power transmission line is unlikely to be considered significant
either by existing residents of the area or by visitors.
7-71



Soil erosion
There is a potential for the transmission line tower foundations and construction activities
to give rise to soil erosion in areas with steep slopes. Simple commonsense precautions
will prevent these impacts being realised.
Effects of electromagnetic radiation
Electromagnetic radiation from power transmission line can interfere with radio reception,
particular with AM reception in areas where signals are weak. Interference with radio
reception will be confined to areas within a few tens of metres of the power line and will
not be a significant problem.
The calculated electric field strength directly under the conductor at midspan is estimated
(Ewbank Preece 1989) to be approximately 2.8 kV/m when the conductor height above
ground-level is 7.5 m at midspan. This will not give rise to any danger to humans or
animals. However, particularly within the park and in the vicinity where giraffe might be
expected, care must be taken to ensure that safety margins are maintained
There is concern that electromagnetic radiation from power transmission lines can give rise
to adverse health effects. However, these effects if any, are at a very low level and
researchers so far have been unable to provide convincing evidence of a link between
health effects and electromagnetic radiation at the levels that would be experienced from
the type of power transmission line proposed.
Fires
There is a possibility that power transmission lines can initiate bush fires if wires come too
close to vegetation under dry and windy conditions. The type and height of vegetation in
the park means that the fire hazard from this source should be negligible.
Noise
Noise emissions due to wind blowing through the wires and towers is not expected to
have any effect on animals within the park.
Aircraft safety
The route chosen by the power transmission line takes account of existing landing fields
and hazards to aircraft will be within accepted standards.
7-72



8. Conclusions and Recommendations
This section summarises the major findings of each study and lists in point form the
recommendations for monitoring  and  management.  It should  be noted  that
recommendations made under each study have not been cross referenced. Thus the
fauna study may recommend re-location of X2-Camp to minimise impacts on the Hell's
Gate National Park animals, the air quality study recommends relocation to ameliorate
odour irnpacts, the noise study recommends relocation to minimise noise impacts and
the socio-economic studies recommend relocation to ensure compliance with KWS's
policy to not permit human habitation in National Parks and to ensure consistency of
the application of the law  to both KPC  and the Maasai.  These individual
recommendations each stand on their own, but of course when assessed for
appropriiateness those that arise from more than one analysis may be considered to
have additional weight.
The overall conclusion is that the proposed power station as set out in the feasibility
study (Ewbank Preece, 1989) is an acceptable development from an environmental
point of view. This conclusion assumes that the power station is constructed as
described in the feasibility study and in particular that reinjection of waste water takes
place. It is noted that the feasibility study has not demonstrated that reinjection can
accept the volumes of water that will need to be disposed of. Also a number of
important mitigating measures are proposed. These are summarised below.
8.1 FLORA
Flora studies have documented baseline conditions in the area around the existing and
proposed power stations. The broad information from the baseline studies has been
summarised on the vegetation distribution map Figure 6.2.1. The main ways in which
geothermal development could be expected to affect vegetation would be via the action
of gaseous emissions, by the action of hot or cold geothermal brine either as flowing
water on the surface or as airborne droplets of geothermal brine and finally by the
physical removal of vegetation to make way for roads, drilling pads, buildings and so
on.
The vegetation distribution map shows only evidence of effects caused by the latter
activity,. Physical removal of vegetation results not only in the destruction of the
vegetation but may also result in the introduction of new species to the area and the
displacement of existing useful species that may be food sources for the local fauna.
Because of the status of the area as a National Park, it will be important to minimise
changes to the existing flora through introduced species. This can be achieved by
replanting disturbed areas with local grasses and vegetation as soon as possible after
the disturbance and by removing by hand, unwanted plants as they appear.
Detailed inspections of the area reveal vegetation that has been damaged by the action
of hot geothermal brine. These effects are very local (a few metres generally) and are
confined to drill pads and water courses where hot geothermal brine has been allowed
to flow unconfined over the ground. This procedure is no longer practiced. Such
damage is generally temporary, but it provides an opportunity for exotic species to
invade and displace indigenous species, which the local fauna may rely on for food.
8-1



Detailed studies have been undertaken to determine species occurrence in four one
hectare plots, two in a site that lies in the area of influence of tne existing power
station and two in an area that might be expected to be affected by the proposed
power station. Data from these plots showed no effects that could be attributable to
the existing power station. These data will also form useful baseline data that will
allow changes in species occurrence to be detected if any such changes do occur as a
result of the power station development and operation.
Flower trial studies have been undertaken as a joint study with Oserian Development
Company to attempt to find adverse effects on commercially important plants grown
on the flower farms. The principal concern is that power station emissions could affect
flower growth and quality. To date, although differences in plot performance have
been found it is considered that these are most likely to be due to non-air pollution
factors. These studies will be continued.
In summary the following safeguards and monitoring work should be adopted to
minimise impacts.
1.    Keep area of natural vegetation cleared to a minimum.
2.    Make use of deep reinjection of brine and drilling water to avoid potential
toxic effects on flora.
3.    Cleared areas should be quickly rehabilitated with appropriate indigenous
flora to prevent the growth of opportunistic species.
4.    Monitoring of the abundance and diversity of natural vegetation should
continue. If necessary, appropriate action should be taken by KWS such
as controlled grazing and burning of park areas. The Environmental Unit
of KPC should be made fully aware of all such activities.
5.    The potential effect on local flower farms should be monitored with the
flower trails continuing for a total of two years. If the Oserian Estate
wish to extend the trials longer than this they should be given access to
the plots.
KPC's Environmental Monitoring Unit at Olkaria have sufficient expertise to undertake
this work, provided assistance (through a local Kenyan consultancy) is available for
specialist advice such as the species occurrence studies.
8.2 SOILS
Soil erosion has been identified as a particularly difficult area of the environment to
manage at Olkaria. Soils comprise deep, poorly consolidated volcanic ash deposits
overlaying lava flows. These are readily eroded by rainfall run-off, waste water from
wells (drilling or testing) and burst water pipes or sumps.  Erosion channels once
initiated can then grow spectacularly until a stable land form is re-established. Much of
8-2



erosion control rests in the application of good engineering practice. The following
points list mitigating measures and monitoring studies.
1.   It is recommended that effectiveness of the erosion control measures be
monitored by visual inspections undertaken at monthly intervals during
construction and annually in the operation phase.
2.    KPC should provide strong guidelines for the resident engineer who
should be briefed by a soils expert as to the nature of the risks. The
resident engineer should closely supervise contractors to ensure that
contractors activities do not lead to erosion.
3.    Disturbed areas cleared of vegetation should be minimised.
4.    Slopes in cut and fill earthworks should be minimised.
5     Revegetation of disturbed areas should  be undertaken as soon as
possible.   Signs should  be placed  to  indicate  areas undergoing
rehabilitation.
6.    All fluid discharges should be piped or transferred in concrete lined open
channels from the source to sumps or disposal areas.
8.3 FAUNA
The fauna survey has identified approximate baseline conditions for large herbivores,
their migration routes and the avian species in the area. It is concluded that the power
station development will result in the loss of some habitat due to presence of physical
structures, buildings, roads, pipelines and so on. In addition the presence of increased
human activity will alienate some areas.
Despite these inevitable impacts it is concluded that power station development would
not result in an unacceptable level of impact.  The following list summarises the
safeguards and monitoring programs that should be undertaken to ensure that impacts
are miniimised.
'I.    Game-proof fencing of the holding ponds to prevent wildlife drinking
geothermal brine, which if consumed over an extended period may lead
to chronic poisoning due to excess fluoride and other trace elements in
the water.
2.    Deep reinjection of drilling water and brine.
:3.    Location of drains and pipelines so that they do not form barriers for
small animals.
4.    Introduction of speed humps to reduce animal deaths from excessive
vehicle speeds.
5.    Minimising area taken up by roads, padsites and plant to reduce loss of
habitat.
8-3



6.    Training of workers regarding park regulations particularly with regard to
interaction with animals and littering.
7.    Adequate facilities for waste dispcsal.
8.    Bans on the introduction by the workforce of exotic animals (such as
domestic dogs and cats) and exotic plants (apart from indoor plants).
9.    Cleared areas should be rehabilitated with indigenous vegetation as soon
as possible to restore habitat.
10.  In general, fencing should be kept to a minimum to avoid loss of habitat.
Care should be taken to ensure that there are no small animals trapped
inside fenced areas.
11.   Animal numbers, movements and distribution should be monitored. This
should be done either independently by KPC or in liaison with KWS.
KPC's Environmental Monitoring Unit should actively participate in these
studies and should be made aware of the findings of these studies and
the management decisions which are made as a result of these findings.
1 2.   Vehicle movements within the park should be monitored.
13.  It is considered desirable that in the long-term  there are no human
settlements within the park.
8.4 AIR QUALITY
Air quality studies have concluded that existing air quality in the vicinity of the existing
power station, is satisfactory in that no health effects would be expected. However
odour impacts occur over a large area. Emissions from the proposed power station will
occur through discharge into the cooling tower plumes. This is predicted to result in
much lower ground-level concentrations of hydrogen sulphide than occur from the
existing power station, despite the fact that the proposed power station will be have
42 per cent greater generating capacity than the existing one.
It is concluded that for most sites odour impacts will remain more or less at present
levels, in terms of the number of times the odour threshold is exceeded. The exception
is sites close to the proposed power station such as X2-Camp and the Olkaria Gate
area.  At X2-Camp the number of detected odours is expected to increase by
approximately 38 per cent.  All other occupied residential areas are expected to
experience only minor increases in odour events.
Small amounts of radioactive radon will be emitted as non-condensable geo gas.
Maximum long-term ground-level concentrations are predicted to be of the order of one
per cent of the WHO air quality guideline.
The following recommendations concerning air quality are made.
1.    X2-Camp should be relocated to prevent occupants from being exposed
to nuisance levels of odour.
8-4



2.    Meteorological monitoring should be continued at the X2-Camp site.
3.    One and preferably two continuous hydrogen sulphide monitors (with
logging equipment) should be established to monitor hydrogen sulphide
concentrations at the flower trial areas to the north of the East Olkaria
power station and at X2-Camp. Data collected by the monitor should be
used to verify the prediction made by the dispersion modelling study and
the model should be fine-tuned so that KPC have an improved predictive
tool to assess impacts and to provide further data to other environmental
monitoring programs, such as vegetation monitoring.
4.   The cooperative flower trial studies with Oserian Development Company
should be continued until such times as Oserian Development Company
are satisfied that the sensitivity of their operations to hydrogen sulphide
has been determined.  It would be useful if these studies were to
establish the threshold at which adverse effects begin to occur. This
would be useful information for KPC's future planning. It is envisaged
that these studies may need a further period of at least two years.
5.    A survey of radon concentrations in the ambient air near the existing
powers station and proposed power station should be undertaken.
5.    KPC's Environmental Unit at Olkaria should continue to develop its
expertise in dispersion modelling and air quality monitoring and to make
use of monitoring data to assess the performance of the dispersion
model. This enhancement in expertise will require overseas training or
the use of outside consultants with expertise in air quality matters, or a
combination of both.
8.5 NOISE
Noise studies have concluded that background-levels in the area will be very low, less
than 30 dB(A), from time to time. Given this, it is concluded that an appropriate
environrnental noise quality goal is that LA10 levels from the development should not
exceed 35 dB(A) at any residential receptor. In the absence of natural topographic
barriers that would attenuate noise, levels from wells under test are predicted to
exceed 35 dB(A) at distances of between 4 and 5 km from the well. Given the
temporary nature of the well testing operation, these impacts are not seen as causing a
problem and should be excluded from the 35 dB(A) goal provided this activity remains a
temporary or intermittent activity. Noise emission from the proposed power station
when operating, will exceed the 35 dBMA) level out to approximately two kilometres.
From tirne to time (under conditions of low background noise) the noise level from the
power station will be intrusive at X2-Camp.
Recomnmended mitigating measures are as follows:
11.   Re-locate X2-Camp  to  outside  the  35  dB(A) contour for
operational noise; and
8-5



2.    Monitor noise levels at the Olkaria Gate KWS residences and provide
acoustical treatment of these residences if the measured LA10 levels due
to the power station are above 35 dB(A) and if the affected residents
request such treatment.
8.6 LAKE NAIVASHA
Lake Naivasha is an important body of fresh water in the Rift Valley. Lake levels have
shown large variations over the course of this century and presumably will continue to
do so regardless of whether geothermal development takes place or not. The water
balance for the lake is not well understood. Part of the complication lies in determining
the unknown sub-ground flows which are generally acknowledged as the mechanism
by which the water stays "fresh" despite the lake being in a high annual evaporation
area and there being no surface outflow.
KPC is a user of Lake Naivasha water for drilling, power station make-up water and
domestic water supply. KPC's abstraction in 1 990 was estimated to be approximately
3.1 per cent of total water abstracted. With this comparatively low level of abstraction
the impact of KPC's activities on the lake are concluded to be minor.
KPC also abstract water from the geothermal field in the process of using steam. The
proposed power station will reinject much of this water back into the geothermal field.
There is also a proposal that the existing power station adopt a policy of reinjection.
Net water abstraction from the geothermal field is estimated to be approximately 4x106
m3/year. This is estimated to be approximately 10 per cent of the lowest estimate of
ground water flow  under the lake.  Thus in the unlikely event that the lake is
hydraulically connected to the geothermal field, the power development activities would
only perturb the flow by 10 per cent (at most).
It is clear that the lake will come under increasing pressure as development in the
region makes greater and greater demands for water in other towns and cities, not only
Naivasha. The Maiewa dam proposal plans to abstract water from a river that is a
major input to the lake. There is a need for a thorough understanding of the lake's
water balance so it is possible to develop reliable, sustainable, development plans for
the lake. Even through KPC is a relatively minor user of the lake (3.1 per cent of the
total abstraction) it is in its interest to support studies that will help improve the
understanding of the water balance.
8.7 WATER DISPOSAL
The consultants have based their environmental assessment on the assumption that
waste water will be disposed of by reinjection. It is understood that field experience
world-wide shows that one or two wells are adequate for the disposal of water from
high enthalphy fields. It is desirable to undertake tests to confirm that the proposed
reinjection wells do have the capacity to accept water at a suitable depth and at the
required rate without interference with the geothermal field.
8-6



8.8 SOCIO-ECONOMICS
Socio-economic studies have established baseline data on a range of socio-economic
topics including population size, schools, housing, health facilities, traffic, water
supplies, employment, tourism, structure of the local economy, community attitudes,
attitudes/perceptions of tourists, recreational facilities, the Maasai and the Hell's Gate
National Park.
The main conclusion of these studies is that the infrastructure of the area is presently
stretched beyond its capacity. Thus even though KPC's development plans represent
only a relatively minor increase in population and hence demand for services, it will be
important that the project be developed in a self sufficient way. That is that housing,
schooling, medical services, recreational facilities and so on should be provided by the
project and no reliance should be put on these facilities being provided by the existing
local government.
It is alsci concluded that the project will not have an adverse impact on tourism and can
be made to enhance the attraction of the area to tourists, particularly to visitors to the
Hell's Gate National Park. It is considered that the upgraded road makes access to the
park far easier and allows the park to be accessed by visitors from Nairobi relatively
easy.  The improved road has also been a significant gain to most of the local
community with travel times from the Naivasha to the SW side of the lake being
halved. Also dust fallout levels on areas adjacent to the road have been very much
reduced. The power station itself also has the capacity to draw visitors to the park.
There will of course be some negative impacts on the park as the power station
buildings and infrastructure and associated human presence will alienate some land
from use by animals.
Specific recommendations to ensure that the project does not strain the Naivasha area
infrastructure and that the impacts on the park are minimised, are listed below.
1.    X2-Camp or re-located  KPC  camp will need to  be expanded  to
accommodate an additional 245 employees. It is recommended that this
accommodation be located outside the park.
2.    220 additional permanent houses will have to be built at the Estate. It
has, in the past, been suggested by KPC that some of the existing Junior
staff houses be demolished to provide land for two or three storeyed
flats.
3.    The additional water requirement at X2-Camp, will have to be catered for
by increasing the existing water supply. At the same time, the existing
supply at the Estates should be upgraded and capacity increased.
4     Additional sewage treatment facilities will be required both at the
relocated X2-Camp and the Estates housing.
5.    KPC will need to acquire 2 more staff buses.
6.    The present KPC-KWS committee should continue to meet at regular
intervals during all the phases of the Geothermal Development.
8-7



7.    KPC should renovate and expand the existing recreational club and
upgrade its indoor games facilities.  In addition, a new football pitch
should be built.
8.    Adequate road safety measures should be put in place, after joint KPC-
KWS discussions, to ensure the safety of KPC and KWS employees and
visitors to the Hell's Gate Netional Park.
8.9 INTERACTION WITH THE PARK
This summary draws together views developed in a number of specialist studies. It is
the consultants' view that the effect of KPC's activities in the Hell's Gate National Park
can be managed so that the outcome is positive, at least in terms of the park's function
as a tourist attraction. The effects on the conservation function of the park will of
course not be positive, except to the extent that additional income from tourists (that
KPC's presence may produce), would provide KWS with additional resources to
undertake its conservation role. However, it is considered that even the inevitable
negative impacts on the conservation function can be managed in a way that will be
acceptable to KWS. Some recommended actions, such as relocation of X2-Camp and
restoration of the area, would serve to partially compensate the park for land lost to the
power station.
The following are recommendations made concerning actions to be undertaken by KPC
to assist in integrating the proposed power station into the park so that the benefits for
tourism are maximised. These recommendations are additional to those made for the
protection of flora, fauna, soils and so on, which have been discussed elsewhere.
O     KPC and KWS should maintain the formal meeting structure already
established to plan a detailed management strategy for the way in which
the park and the power station should interact and to deal with
management issues as they arise.
o     KPC should prepare explanatory material on geothermal power generation
to be incorporated in the Hell's Gate National Park's interpretation centre,
which is located near the central tower. This material should be prepared
so that it is compatible in style with the display information already being
prepared by KWS.
o     KPC and KWS should prepare a high quality explanatory leaflet that can
be handed to tourists visiting the park. The leaflet should set out the
following information:
the basic park rules and safety precautions that should be
adopted by tourists to protect them from harm or
unpleasant experiences associated with the fauna and
geothermal activities:
the locations of major attractions in the park including the
interpretation centre and geothermal power station, and;
8-8



-     the facilities available to tourists wishing to find out more
about the power station.
O     KPC should develop a simple "tourist trail" that could be followed by
visitors interested in this aspect of the park. The trail would lead tourists
to a series of features with high quality, professionally prepared signs
explaining points of interest. The tourist trail could include a well-head, a
separator station, any sites or equipment used in the environmental
monitoring programs (for example meteorological station, air quality
monitoring station, flower trial areas and so on) and the power station
itself.
o     KPC should include in the power station design, facilities that will allow
tourists to inspect the power station without disturbing power station
workers. This should include suitable signs and explanatory material to
ensure that tourist do not visit areas which may be unsafe, or where they
may interfere with the normal running of the power station.  Power
station personnel should be briefed on appropriate ways of interacting
with visitors. Guided tours should be provided at set times, or days of
the week, so that it will become known when guided tours are available.
KPC should conduct all its activities in a way which recognises the status of the land
as a gazetted National Park. This imposes constraints on work-practices that would
not apply in other areas. For example verv high standards must be applied concerning
the disposal of rubbish and disused equipment, such as pipes, silencers, building
material, earth-moving equipment and so. Some remedial work needs to be done on
the matter of disused equipment and abandoned sites. All waste disposal areas should
be outside the park boundary. Finally, a significant reduction in visual impact can be
achieved for visitors approaching the park from the north through the Olkaria Gate
entrance by planting trees and shrubs on the western side of the approach road. Visual
impacts looking down on the power station from elevated viewing point will be very
much reduced by carefully selecting "natural" colours for power station buildings,
power line pylons and unburied pipes. A weathered galvanised finish on the power
pylons can be considered a suitable colour for the pylons. The pylons on the existing
power plant transmission line blend well with the natural vegetation in the area.

NE. Figures given are approx:mations. The degree of erosion hazard refers to the risk of erosion 'rom the cut slope, the
fill slope and from any gully w;nich may have started as a result of the development. Well pads with hign or very high
erosion hazard require close attention. Grass was being planted on the fill slope of 714 in November 1990 and
the fill slopes of 726 and 717 in May - June 1991.
FURTHER NOTES ON WELL PADS
701. This is on almost level ground and is stable.
702. Same condition as 703. Some Kikuyu grass appears to have been planted on
the spoil along the N side. It would be better if the ground was graded uniformly
before planting.
703. This pad is on nearly level ground and is quite stable.
Some grass planting on bare surfaces is needed.
704. This is apparently an unproductive well. The cut slope is high but the angle is
not too steep and stabilisation with grass may be possible. The fill slope is very
broken. There are cracks and holes which are partly covered with grass and rather
dangerous. Smoothing and replanting is needed.
705.  Well pad is on nearly level ground and stable.
706.  This pad is on fairly level ground and apart from some minor gullying where the
waste water has been discharged, it is stable.
707.  The cut slope is badly rilled.  The fill slope is very irregular. A large gully on the
N side has been partly filled but grass planting is needed urgently. The outwash from
the sump pond during drilling caused gullying and there is a deep gully alongside the
Appendix 6.3.1.1 Page -2



access road due to the failure of a culvert. Stabilisation of the bare ground to minimise
runoff by planting grass should be carried out urgently.
709. This pad is on nearly level ground and is stable.
710. The pad is stable but the spoil needs smoothing and grassing.
711. The pad is fairly stable but the sump pit broke and caused a deep gully to the S
side. The upper part of the gully is partly stabilised but the lower section is eroding
badly and has joined a new gully that has developed below 709.
Appendix 6.3.1 .1 Page -3



712. There is a serious gully on the S side of this well pad which has developed in a
small valley that was carrying effluent during the drilling phase. The gully is about 4 m
wide and 5 m deep and there are huge heaps of spoil which are eroding rapidly. They
need to be stabilised with grass as soon as possible. The well is currently under test
and waste water is being discharged to a pond on the fill side. There is a gully at the
NE end which appears to have been caused by breaching of an earlier pond.
713. This well was under test in November and the waste water was channeled into
a nearby valley. Although the first section of the channel was stabilised with concrete,
a huge gully, about 10 m wide and 7 m deep, developed in the valley below. The gully
sides are slumping and the gully floor is filled with bush that has fallen in. Potentially
there is much sediment that could be transported to the channel alongside the power
station. However where this valley is crossed by the tarmac road it appears to be well
grassed and stable.
714. Grass planting ( Kikuyu and star) was in progress in November but was partially
negated by the construction of a sump pond for use during testing.
715. The cut slope has partly stabilised with star grass. The toe slope was very
irregular but has been smoothed. Star grass should be planted.
717. The cut slope is very high, about 7 m, and nearly vertical. The spoil on the
lower side has been smoothed and grassing is taking place (June, 1991). The southern
end of the pad needs grassing urgently as it is a potential source of sediment that can
be carried to the power station.
718. The fill slope was very irregular but has been graded uniformly and needs
planting with star grass as a matter of urgency to prevent sediment being carried to the
power station.
719. The fill slope is broken up and should be smoothed and planted with grass as
soon as testing of the well is completed.
720. This well has still to be tested. The valley to the S of the pad should not be
allowed to carry the waste water. It is well vegetated with trees and shrubs which are
different from those on the surrounding slopes. There is considerable risk of erosion in
this valley and waste water should be piped to the sump below 715 for subsequent
reinjection at 708.
721. This well is in an area of rock. The cut slope and fill slope are fairly stable on
account of the rock fragments. Establishment of grass may be difficult but there is little
risk of erosion.
722. This well pad is on fairly level ground and there is minimal risk of erosion.
723. This well has just been drilled. Some grass planting is needed to stabilise the
loose spoil but is not urgent.
724. Drilling is in progress. The risk of erosion is not high.
Appendix 6.3.1.1 Page -4



725. This is a new pad which has still to be drilled. The risk of erosion is not high but
the fill slope should be staoilised with grass.
726. This is a new pad. The fill slope has been well graded and stabilised with star
grass. T he cut slope has been bevelled to an angle of about 22 degrees. Stabilisation
with grass should be carried out before it erodes.
727. This is a new pad. The risk of erosion is not high but the fill slope should be
stabilised with grass.
NE-G. This pad has been sited on a very steep hillside and both the cut slope and the
toe slope are unstable. The site is not far from the existing camp. Apparently it has
been abandoned on environmental grounds. If this is so, immediate steps should be
taken to repair the damage as far as possible and to grass the bare surfaces. Well pad
708 was also abandoned after partial testing due to proximity to the camp.
M2.  This is referred to as a scientific well. The area is stable.
