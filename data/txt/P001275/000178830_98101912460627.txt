I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Local Energy Resources
1.01      The greatest potential source of energy in Kenya is in hydroelectric
power and, although the potential for geothermal power has been recognized for
some time, only now has the comparative cost become sufficiently attractive to
warrant its development. In spite of continued search, there has been no
success in locating reserves of oil or gas in Kenya. In rural areas parti-
cularly, firewood and charcoal are used extensively for energy needs while
bagasse is used as a source of fuel in the sugar industry. There are no known
coal reserves in Kenya although coal deposits have been found in neighboring
Tanzania.
Hydroelectric Resources
1.02      The hydro power potential of Kenya has been estimated to be about
6,000 MW (30,000 GWh per year), however, half of this lies in small rivers and
is uneconomic to develop. The remaining half is on the Tana River and of this
only about 800 MW or 4,000 to 5,000 GWh per year is economically feasible of
development (1,500,000 tons of oil equivalent per annum), about 300 MW of this
potential is already developed (para. 2.05). With little natural storage,
there is considerable variation in the seasonal flow of the Tana River. This
variation affects the output of the existing hydro plants accordingly, although
there will be a significant improvement after the Upper Reservoir, now under
construction, begins to impound water in 1981. The National Power Development
Plan, 1978-2000, funded by the Bank under Loan 1147-KE, (para. 2.10) was
prepared by Merz and McLellan and Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners of the U.K.,
consultants to the East African Power and Lighting Company, Limited (EAP&L),
and their 1978 Report lists the following potential sites on the Tana River in
order of priority; Kiambere - 120 1MW, Mutonga - 70 MW, Grand Falls - 88 MW.
Geothermal Resources
1.03      The most attractive geothermal potential is at Olkaria, in the Rift
Valley near Lake Naivasha about 100 km from Nairobi. Exploration began over
20 years ago, and investigations funded since then by UNDP and EAP&L indicate
that the site should be capable of supporting power generation of 100 MW
and possibly more than 200 MW. Two other potential sites, at Lake Hannington
and Eburu, have not been explored, but it is expected that with further
search and investigation geothermal power could contribute significantly
toward meeting Kenya's electric power needs.
Imported Energy
1.04      The main source of primary energy in Kenya is imported oil and
petroleum products, a secondary source being electrical energy from Uganda
(para. 2.04). Over the period 1973-77, the consumption of imported liquid
fuels as a percentage of total energy consumption was about 85%. Except for
minor amounts of speciality oils and greases, most of the imported crude oil



- 2 -
is processed at the refinery at Mombasa. Between 1973 and 1977, an average of
about 2.7 million tons per annum of crude oil were refined; of this total the
amount used domestically was about 1.5 million tons per annum, while the
remainder was exported to neighboring countries. During the period 1973-77,
the value of net imports of crude oil and petroleum products averaged about
13% of the value of Kenya's imports. The following table contains a summary
of the growth in energy consumption in Kenya.
Tons of Oil Equivalent (Thousands)
1973            1977
Coal and coke imports                         50              44
Oil consumption                            1,360           1,606
Hydro generated electricity 1/                98              167
Hydro imported electricity                    72              65
Total Energy Consumption               1,580           1,882
I/   1 GWh = 330 equivalent tons of petroleum (based on thermal
steam plant heat rate of 3,300 Kcal/kWh).
1.05      Kenya's dependence on imported oil and the potential effects it
can have on the country's economic growth is clearly demonstrated by the oil
crisis of 1973. Over the period 1964-72, a growth rate of 6.5% per annum was
achieved in Kenya, but this dropped very sharply after 1973, and the average
for the years 1973-75 was 3.4%, one of the main causes being the international
oil crisis and higher import prices which forced the Government to enact
restrictive economic policies. Secondly, Kenya's merchandise import bill
doubled between 1972-74 (from US$632 million in 1972 to US$1,237.3 million in
1974), despite the fact that import volumes were only 9% higher in the latter
year. The rise in the import bill again was due to higher import prices as
well as the rising costs of energy supplies, particularly petroleum. The
dramatic rise in the petroleum prices is seen in that the average price of
crude oil increased from K.1 5.8 per ton (1972) to Kb 23.9 per ton (1974) and
was Kb 39.3 per ton in 1977. Finally, before 1973, in monetary terms Kenya
was virtually in balance in its imports and exports of petroleum products.
The receipts earned in Kenya from exports of petroleum products were almost
sufficient to pay for the country's own petroleum needs. However, the
price of crude increased much faster than the price of refined petroleum
products, and this has led to Kenya now having an adverse balance on its
petroleum trade. Compounding the problem has been the border closure between
Kenya and Tanzania and the break-up of the East African Community which has
meant a loss of markets and stagnation in shipments of refined petroleum.



- 3 -
1.06      Government has thus realized that as long as oil remains the major
source of primary energy and substantial amounts of foreign exchange are
expended in paying for crude oil imports, Kenya's economy is very vulnerable
to sudden increases in petroleum prices. Thus, the Government's strategy, as
specified in the Development Plan 1979-83, is to rationalize the use of imported
petroleum and to develop and utilize domestic power resources to obtain some
alleviation of the country's dependence on imported oil.
Relative Energy Pricing
1.07      The price of many essential commodities, including electricity
and fuel, is regulated by the Government of Kenya. The cost of electricity
is the same to consumers in all parts of the country although certain isolated
areas are supplied with expensive diesel-generated electricity. Usually,
prices of petroleum products vary regionally and, in general, reflect the cost
of transportation. For example, the wholesale price of regular gasoline less
duties and taxes in Mombasa is KSh 1.547 per liter. Duty of KSh 0.6, sales
tax of KSh 0.705 and transportation of KSh 0.143 bring the wholesale price of
gasoline in Nairobi to KSh 2.995 and the retail price to KSh 3.16 per liter.
There are no duties or sales tax on diesel fuel and fuel oil. The wholesale
price of diesel fuel in Mombasa is KSh 1.347 and in Nairobi KSh 1.49, and the
wholesale price of fuel oil in Mombasa is KSh 0.985 and in Nairobi KSh 1.145.
1.08      The relative cost of energy in Kenya is illustrated in the following
table:
Price per Unit        Cost per      6
in Nairobi     Kilocalories x 10
Kilocalories/Unit          (K shillings)
Fuel oil                 9.7 x 106/ton              1,215                  125
Gas oil                 10.2 x 106/ton              2,751                  270
Kerosene                10.3 x 106/ton              2,242                  218
Firewood                   3 x 10 /ton                400                 133
Electricity              860/kWh                       42                 490
Considering also relative convenience in use of various types of energy, the
above price structure appears to be reasonably well balanced.

II. THE POWER SECTOR
General
2.01      The availability of power to consumers in Kenya is, in general,
limited to the central and southwestern sections of the country and along the
southeast coast (see IBRD map 14278R). There are several isolated diesel
installations in the north and east, but people living in these areas do not
have easy access to electricity. Of the estimated 14.4 million inhabitants in
Kenya, 90% live in rural areas. Only 6% 1/ of the total population has access
to electricity, resulting in an average estimated per capita consumption of
electrical energy in 1978 of about 90 kWh.
The Power Supply Entities
2.02      Public electricity in Kenya is now being supplied by three compa-
nies: The East African Power and Lighting Company, Limited (EAP&L), The
Kenya Power Company, Limited (KPC) and The Tana River Development Company,
Limited (TRDC). EAP&L coordinates all sources of power, purchases in bulk
from the other two companies, staffs and manages them, and is the sole dis-
tributor. Background information and a description of the three companies
is given in Chapter V. In addition, the Tana River Development Authority
(TRDA) is now constructing a dam to store water to augment the low river
flows during the dry season for irrigation purposes and will make use of the
head available for the production of hydroelectric power. The output will
be fed into the EAP&L power system (para. 2.11).
Existing Facilities
2.03      Most of the electricity sold by EAP&L is distributed through an
interconnected system covering five major areas of Kenya: Nairobi, Mount
Kenya, Coast, Rift and Western Districts - which are shown on the map IBRD
14278R. Power is supplied to some of the large centers in outlying areas
by isolated diesel stations. There are numerous small privately operated
generators, mostly isolated and some used for standby purposes. No consider-
ation has been given to the effect of these on the power supply system in
Kenya. The existing generating plant operated by the three companies (listed
in detail in Annex 2.1) together with those privately owned are shown in the
following table:
1/   Percentages of population with access to electricity in other East
African countries are as follows: Lesotho 3.5%; Malawi 2%; Sudan 8%;
Tanzania 7%; Zaire 2%.

2.04      This generating plant is augmented by a 30-MW bulk supply from
the Uganda Electricity Board (UEB) under a long-term agreement, extending
to year 2005 (para. 2.14), giving a total installed capacity of 496 MW on the
interconnected system. However, the effective capability is reduced to
460 MW due to derating some of the older diesel and gas turbine plant because
of their age. The dates of plant retirements will depend to some extent on
available river flows. For the purposes of this report, it has been assumed
that 21 MW of diesel plant, 2 MW of steam turbine plant, and 6 MW of hydro
plant will have been retired by 1985. In 1978 the gross output was 1529 GWh
of which 1053 GWh was supplied from the hydroelectric generating stations.
2.05      The three largest hydroelectric power stations (Kindaruma -
44 MW, Gitaru - 145 MW, and Kamburu - 94 MW located on the Tana River some
70 miles to the east of Nairobi) are owned by TRDC, and the 98-MW Kipevu
steam station located at Mombasa is owned by EAP&L. Two smaller hydro-
electric developments, Tana (10.4 MW) and Wainjii (7.4 MW), are owned by KPC.
The remaining four very small hydroelectric installations (3.3 MW in total)
together with eight diesel-electric stations, the Nairobi South and the gas
turbine plant, are owned by EAP&L. All of these generating stations are
interconnected by means of 132-kV and 33-kV transmission and subtransmission
lines. This system is linked to Uganda by a 132-kV double-circuit transmis-
sion line for the transfer of 30-MW bulk power. One of the 132-kV transmis-
sion lines between Kamburu and Nairobi is constructed for operation at 275 kV
but will be operated at 220 kV some time after 1982 (para. 2.12). The distri-
bution voltages are 11 kV and 415/240 kV. EAP&L also operates four isolated
diesel-electric power stations aggregating 2.2 MW in the northern and eastern
part of the country. However, for the purposes of this report, they have
been disregarded because of their isolation and size.
2.06      The supply of power is reasonably reliable.  The system frequency is
controlled by UEB through the tie-line to Uganda, and following a load change,
EAP&L adds or removes generating equipment from its system to keep the import
of power just slightly below the contract limit of 30 MW. This requirement
has necessitated load shedding on occasion. The losses in the system amount
to about 10%, which appear to be reasonable.

Demand for Power and Energy
2.07      In the preparation of the National Power Development Plan, 1978-
2000 (para. 1.02), the consultants very carefully examined the requirements
of the consumers in each of the five districts: Nairobi, Mount Kenya,
Coast, Rift and Western, and by consumer - Domestic, Off--Peak, Industrial,
Commercial, Street Lighting and Small Consumer - for the period 1972 to 1976.
From these data, growth trends were established.  The rales of growth from
1972 to 1976 for the districts were as follows: Nairobi 6.9%, Coast 9%,
Western 10.6%, Rift Valley 11.3%, Mount Kenya 10.7%, the weighted average
of which is 8%. The cyclical growth rate due to the changing demands of
industrial development in Kenya, is shown by the 11.2% increase in demand in
1977 over that of 1976, 8.1% in 1978, and expected rates of 9.1% in 1979, 9.9%
in 1980, 8.5% in 1981, falling to 7.0% in the mid-1980s (Annex 2.2). The
largest district, Nairobi, which accounts for about 60% of total sales, is
growing at the lowest rate because it is the most developed and is expected to
continue at this rate. In the examination of the annual growth for Nairobi,
it was noted that sales of off-peak power were significantly lower in 1976
than previous years. This was evidently caused by the suspension of the 30-NW
supply from UEB for about two months, and the necessity to turn off the
heating of domestic hot water remotely by means of "ripple control". A
suitable adjustment was made to the average results so as to take this
suppressed demand into account. The higher rate of growth in the Coast
District reflects the Government's efforts to expand the industrial and
commercial areas away from Nairobi, while domestic sales have increased more
slowly. The historical rate of growth is expected to continue except for a
new load at the Ken Ren Fertilizer Plant which required an increase of
13.5 MW and 95 GWh in 1979. Suitable adjustments have been made to the load
forecasts to allow for this large increment. In the Western District, the
rate of growth has varied one year to the next with an average of 9%. One new
load, the Pan African Paper Mill, would result in a large increase in one
year, and the effect has been averaged out over several y(ears. The Rift
Valley and Mount Kenya Districts have also grown at variable rates. There
have been no significant adjustments to the actual growth rate for the
forecast except that, if the Kenya Fibre Corporation builds a factory in
the Mount Kenya District, the increase in sales would be Significantly higher
than was assumed in the forecast.
2.08      Most of the demand for energy is from industry where much of the
sales increase is expected to originate. There are five consumers who average
more than 1 GWh per month, the largest being the Bamburi F'ortland Cement
Company at 7.8 GWh per month and a demand of 18,000 kVA. Twenty organizations
consume more than 500,000 kWh while there are 103 who consume between 100,000
and 500,000 kWh per month.
2.09      The demand for power has been met by the existing generating plant,
although in 1977 after making an allowance for units out of service for
maintenance and repair, the firm capacity was only 5 MW above the peak demand.
This improved in 1978 with the commissioning of the Gitaru units, where the
firm surplus capacity in the system became 128 MW above the peak demand.



- 7 -
The energy situation, however, is quite different. In 1977 the firm continuous
energy available (i.e. from the existing thermal plants, and from the hydro
plants limited by the river flows available in the driest year) was 153 GWh
below that required, and in 1978, even with the addition of the Gitaru units,
the firm energy shortfall would have been 142 GWh. During some periods, it
has been necessary to disconnect certain areas from the system in order to
reduce the demand to the capability of the available generating plant. It is
evident that Kenya requires the installation of additional firm generating
facilities to meet the potential deficiency in energy. The actual and forecast
sales of electricity from 1976 to 1988 are shown in Annex 2.2. The forecasts
for an average water year and a dry year are shown in chart form in Annex 2.3
and 2.4.
Long-term Development Plan
2.10      During the preparation of the Gitaru Loan (1147-KE), it was foreseen
that generation of geothermal power at Olkaria was becoming more attractive,
and to investigate the possibility and to put it into a long-term perspective,
funds were included for two separate studies. As a result, in October 1977,
Merz and McLellan of the United Kingdom (UK) and the Virkir Consulting Group,
Limited of Iceland completed and submitted a report on Geothermal Development
at Olkaria, in which it was concluded that active development of the Olkaria
site was economically feasible and was the least cost solution to meet the
growing power needs. The report concluded that geothermal power would be
required by 1981. The results of this study were included in the National
Power Development Plan, 1978-2000. Several alternative scenarios to meet the
expected load growth were considered, beginning with the Olkaria project and
taking into account the potential for development of both hydro and thermal
schemes.
Future Development
2.11      The power installations at the TRDA dam (para. 2.02) will consist of
two 20-MW units and storage of water is scheduled to begin in the spring of
1981. These units cannot be considered as a source of firm power supply
because, at the time of greatest need, i.e. during the dry season, the reser-
voir will generally be drawn down to such an extent that the head on the plant
will be insufficient for the generation of any appreciable amount of power.
Instead, they will serve as a source of less expensive energy to replace fuel-
generated energy during the period when the head on the plant is suitable for
power production. Although operated by TRDA, the reservoir will nevertheless
provide increased regulation of the Tana River flows, and the releases of
water during the low flow periods will result in a significant increase in
energy output of the downstream plants - Kamburu, Gitaru and Kindaruma.
2.12      With the diverse load centres and alternate sources of power, (hydro,
steam turbine, diesel, gas turbine), it is now justified to construct a 220-kV
transmission line from Mombasa to the Kamburu hydroelectric generating station
to augment the transmission capabilities of the existing 132-kV line between
the Mombasa and Juja Road sub-station in Nairobi. Upon its completion, forecast
for 1982, it will be possible to transmit additional amounts of low cost hydro
power to the Coast Region, during periods of high river flow, and higher cost



-8-
steam-generated power to Nairobi and the Western Regions, during low flow
periods. The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) has recently
approved a loan for this important link.
2.13      The National Power Development Plan contains a forecast that the
growth in demand will be such that a new power development would be required
at Kiambere by 1984. Funds for feasibility studies to determine whether a
hydro, geothermal, or other conventional thermal projects should be undertaken
are included as part of this project. Additional thermal generating plant at
Mombasa is expected to be required by 1987.
2.14      KPC has requested UEB to increase the power exported to Kenya, but
UEB has been reluctant to provide more than the 30 MW now contracted.   With
seemingly inadequate plant maintenance in Uganda and UEB's recent inability at
times to supply even the 30 MW on a continuous basis, EAP&L does not now
expect that an additional amount of power will be provided. For some time,
there has been a suggestion that a bulk transfer of power from the Kidatu
project in Tanzania may be available for use in Kenya. Although the provision
of power from this source will not be possible in the immediate future, in the
long-term, improved relations may make this transfer of power a possibility.
2.15      Therefore, Kenya's future needs will be met by further development
of geothermal or hydro resources or by thermal stations using imported fossil
fuels. The development program recommended in the National Power Development
Plan will be reviewed periodically, so as to ensure that the least cost
solution to supplying energy needs is obtained.
Rural Electrification
2.16      A Rural Electrification Fund has been established by the Government
and is administered by the Electricity Development Committee, which is com-
prised of representatives of the Ministries of Finance, Economic Planning,
Power and Communications and EAP&L. Rural electrification schemes are managed
and operated by EAP&L, which receives revenue from the consumers and presents
statements of revenue and cost to the committee. EAP&L normally apportions 1%
(about US$500,000 in 1978) of its gross sales revenue to the fund for the
development of supplies in the rural areas. In addition, funds provided from
the interest differential between the soft terms of a Swedish International
Development Agency (SIDA) credit to the Government for the Kamburu project and
the Government's harder onlending terms to TRDC are used to finance the rural
electrification program. A Swedish team, comprising a planning engineer and
two construction foremen, have been seconded to EAP&L to assist in the imple-
mentation of the program.
2.17      It is envisaged that when the Swedish grant ends, the rural elect-
rification program would continue with funds from CIDA, which has made a
direct grant into the Rural Electrification Fund of about Canadian $2.75
million to be disbursed over five years. CIDA would also provide two or three
staff members in a form of technical assistance. Funds would also be provided
for a study on the socio-economic benefits of rural electrification.
2.18      Plans for the future include an increase in the funds allocated for
rural electrification from KL 1.4 million in the Government's Third Five-Year



-9-
Development Plan (1974-78) to Kb 4.2 million in the Fourth Plan period
(1979-83), so that rural electrification could benefit an additional 500,000
people, about 3% of the population. Although staff constraints (para. 2.19)
may limit the expenditure on rural electrification, the training component
(para. 5.14) of this project has been included to alleviate this restraint.
2.19      EAP&L has spent about US$800,000 per annum on 22 schemes during the
1970-76 period. The two major problems encountered with rural electrification
programs in Kenya are the small demand of consumers and the unwillingness
of contractors to undertake works in the rural areas. Demand is low because
the cost limits most rural households to the use of electricity for lighting
and not for any other domestic or productive purposes.  The second problem is
that the contractors, mainly concentrated in urban areas, are unwilling to
undertake minor jobs in the rural areas, and EAP&L does not have sufficient
construction staff to do this type of work.  The geography of the country adds
to the problem in that there are few village concentrations, and the scattered
households make the distribution costly. The training of line construction
workers would be included in the training program (para. 5.14).
2.20      Although some of the rural electrification programs appear to be
uneconomic, the Government has continued to encourage the expansion of the
programs (para. 2.18) in the belief that improvement of the social, commercial
and industrial activities in small communities will tend to reduce migration
to the larger urban centers. Although none of the schemes undertaken to date
are financially viable, most are likely to become remunerative in time.
Meanwhile, the social and economic well-being of the rural community is
gradually being improved.
Previous Bank Lending in the Power Sector
2.21      The proposed loan would be the fourth Bank lending operation for
power in Kenya. The previous loans - US$23 million for the Kamburu Hydro-
electric Project (Loan 745-KE of 1971) and US$63 million for the Gitaru
Hydroelectric Project (Loan 1147-KE of 1975) - were made to TRDC and
US$9 million for the Olkaria Geothermal Engineering Project (Loan S-12-KE of
1978) was made to KPC.
2.22      The Kamburu project was the second phase of the Seven Forks hydro-
electric development on the Tana River (the first was a hydroelectric power
station at Kindaruma). The project was designed to meet the demand for power
in Nairobi and the coastal areas round Mombasa, where most of the industrial
and commercial activities of Kenya are concentrated. The project consisted of
a rock fill dam on the Tana River, an underground power station containing
three 30 MW units, and the associated transmission line facilities connecting
the power station with Nairobi and the Kindaruma hydroelectric power station
further downstream. The project was completed in 1974 about five months
behind schedule with a cost overrun of about 7%. The delays were not unusual
for a construction program of this nature, and the cost overrun was unavoid-
able as it was largely due to currency fluctuations. The Project Performance
Audit Report No. 1230, dated July 14, 1976, based on the Project Completion
Report stated that the construction of the dam, powerhouse and transmission
lines posed no unusual problems, and that the project was completed as planned



- 10 -
with only minor start-up problems. It was noted that EAP&L would have to rely
on the technical expertise of expatriates for some years to come, and that an
appropriate training program was available for all levels of personnel. The
sales and maximum demand forecasts were exceeded to such an extent that with
a tariff increase in 1974, the rate of return for EAP&L, KPC, and TRDC was
21% as compared with the appraisal estimate of 16%.
2.23      The Gitaru project is the last phase of the Seven Forks Scheme
completing the development of the hydro potential of the Upper Tana River.
It is situated between the Kamburu and Kindaruma power stations, and the
three stations operate in cascade. The project consisted basically of a
powerhouse with two 72-MW units with provision for a third similar unit, a
30 meter high dam, 580 meter long, a 900 meter supply tunnel and 4,700-meter
tailrace tunnel, switching station, and an 111 km transmission line to the
Juja Road substation in Nairobi. In addition, funds were provided for three
studies: Geothermal Development at Olkaria (para. 2.10); the National Power
Development Plan 1978-2000 (para. 1.02); and Management and Accounting Consul-
tancy Study (para. 5.10). The project was completed five weeks ahead of
schedule in June 1978, with cost savings of about US$3.5 million under the
Bank loan. The cost savings are almost entirely attributable to unutilized
physical contingencies, a reflection of the good preparation and implementa-
tion that went into this project. A Project Completion Report will be prepared
for this project.
2.24      The Olkaria Geothermal Engineering Loan became effective on April
30, 1979 and the project is the first phase of the development of geothermal
power in Kenya (para. 1.03). This project, located near Lake Naivasha, was
for the preparatory works for the development of a power source and the drill-
ing of steam production wells. There is a certain element of risk associated
with the development of geothermal resources relating to volume of steam
output, and its characteristics of temperature and pressure variations over
time. The engineering loan was used to drill wells to prove that sufficient
steam was available for operation of the first 15-MW unit, and is now being
used to drill production wells for the second 15-MW unit. This loan is a
preliminary though essential phase of the Olkaria Geothermal Power Project.
Bank Strategy in the Power Sector
2.25      The Bank's involvement in this project in Kenya will be the first
development of geothermal power in Africa.  It is expected t:hat this is the
start of a series of geothermal projects in Africa because the requirements
for energy have taxed the resources of Governments during the past few years
with the rapidly rising cost of oil, and the Rift Valley has shown great
potential to supply much needed energy at an economically attractive cost.
The Bank is keeping abreast of geothermal activities by closely following the
studies being made in other countries, particularly in Ethiopia, where UNDP has
recently funded a large investigation program similar to that for the initial
phases of the Olkaria project.
2.26      The Bank is also proposing to assist in meeting the projected short-
age of energy in rural Kenya through a forestry project which would include
fuelwood development on both private and Government land. Although the search



- 11 -
for domestic oil and gas reserves has been unsuccessful so far, Government
intends to continue the exploration program, and assistance may be requested
for further oil and gas exploration. The Bank's continued lending in this
sector would assist in funding Kenya's requirements for energy, for technical
assistance, for the development of Kenyan personnel to fill middle and senior
management positions now held by expatriate staff, and for studies on the
justification and manner that existing resources may be developed to meet the
needs of the country. Without this assistance, growth in the industrial
sector would stagnate, and retard the major objective of the Fourth Five-Year
Development Plan, aimed at alleviation of poverty through the creation of
income-earning opportunities and the provision of social services to meet the
basic needs of the population.
Government Strategy in the Power Sector
2.27      The Government continues to attach high priority to the development
of the power sector in view of its importance for the overall economic devel-
opment of Kenya. Moreover, the need to formulate a comprehensive national
energy development plan has become generally recognized by the Government
since the 1973-74 energy crisis. Thus, to meet the development objectives for
the energy sector as defined in the Development Plan 1979-83 investment
by the Government over the Plan period in generation expansion, transmission
and distribution is estimated at US$226 million of which US$59 million has
been allocated for the geothermal program. The large allocation (about 21% of
total capital expenditure in the power sector over the Plan period) reflects
the Government's emphasis on geothermal development.
III. THE PROJECT
Objectives
3.01      The primary objectives of the project are to assure the availability
of a firm source of power and energy within the country to meet the growth in
demand expected from 1981 to 1985 and, in line with the Government's intention,
as stated in the Development Plan 1979-1983, to assist in reducing the country's
heavy dependence on oil. The power industry must provide a reasonably reliable
source to meet the growing demand for electricity needed for economic growth
and the social well-being of the Kenyan people. The proposed project is the
least costly means of adding to the existing plant to achieve this objective.
A further objective is to strengthen the power industry in Kenya, by the provi-
sion of funds for the training of staff at all levels of the organization, and
maintaining the power industry's financial viability through sound management
and tariff policies.
Background
3.02      The Olkaria geothermal field is located south of Lake Naivasha and
is about 100 km northwest of Nairobi. Initial exploration indicated that
Olkaria (para. 1.03) had excellent potential for development. Thus, in 1970
with UNDP assistance, extensive investigations and surveys were initiated in
order to determine the feasibility of developing power from the available
steam. As a result of the studies, UiDP provided more funds to cover part



- 12 -
of the costs of a further drilling program for six deep wells between 1973
and 1976. Following this, the Bank financed additional feasibility studies
for this geothermal project from proceeds of the Gitaru Hydroelectric Project
(Loan 1147-KE) (para. 2.22). The studies were completed in October 1977
and indicated that the proposed project was feasible. KPC thus reactivated
drilling operations in March 1978 and sought Bank assistance for the power
project. An engineering loan (S-12-KE) for US$9 million provides foreign
funds for part of the cost of the preparatory works estimated to total US$15.5
million. This loan became effective on April 30, 1979. The need for the
engineering loan arose because the volume of steam output, temperature and
pressure variations from a well could vary considerably at different locations
in the geothermal field. Thus, the funds were used to drill production wells
for the proposed generating station, and 80% of the steam requirements for the
first unit were proven before the Bank proceeded with appraisal.
The Project
3.03      The project consists of the construction of an electric generating
station comprising two 15-MW units with associated auxiliaries and other
necessary civil works, together with deep wells driven into a geothermal
reservoir some 1,300 meters below grade level to provide a source of steam.
It is estimated that an annual output of about 95 GWh would be produced from
each 15-MW unit. The project has three distinct phases: preparatory works
(Loan S-12-KE), the commissioning of Unit 1, and the commissioning of Unit 2.
In summary, the phases are as follows:
(a)  Preparatory Works
The drilling of production wells for the steam supply (with
the existing drilling equipment), the purchase of another
drilling rig with its associated equipment and supplies, and
the provision of drill operators and consultants.
(b)  Unit I
(i) The construction of a power house for one 15-MW unit,
complete with all auxiliaries and ancillary electrical and
mechanical equipment, a system to bring steam from the
wells to the power house, a cooling tower and other works
associated with the cooling water system, and roads and
housing,
(ii) The switchyard and 22 km of 132-kV transmission line to
join the Kenya-Uganda transmission line at Naivasha; and
(iii) Consulting engineering.
(c)  Unit 2
(i) Drilling of additional production wells;
(ii) The installation of a second 15-MW unit, its associated
equipment, and civil works, and
(iii) Consulting engineering.



- 13 -
(d) Training and Studies
Training, and studies of further geothermal potential and the
next power project.
3.04      A conventional power house would be constructed to contain the
15-MW steam turbine-driven generators together with all auxiliary equipment
and controls. Since the generating capability of each production well is
expected to be about 2 MW or less, steam from a large number of wells would be
gathered through surface piping and taken to the power house. The power
from the generators would be stepped up to 132 kV by a transformer in an
adjacent switching station and carried to the load centers by a 22-km trans-
mission line which would be connected to the 132-kV Kenya-Uganda transmission
line. Consultants acceptable to the Bank have been retained to carry out the
necessary engineering design and supervision of construction (para. 5.09).
The existing access roads would be improved, and housing would be provided
for operation and maintenance personnel.
3.05      In addition, the project would include two studies to be carried
out by consultants: (a) a complete review of all existing data on geothermal
field at Olkaria to reassess the potential for further geothermal development
and to provide guidance for the location of additional production wells at the
site; and (b) a feasibility study of the Kiambere hydroelectric project (para.
2.13). A more detailed description of the project is contained in Annex 3.1.
Project Cost Estimates
3.06      The total project cost is estimated at US$84.3 million equivalent;
the net cost excluding duties and taxes is US$74.7 million. The project's
foreign exchange component is estimated to be US$44.3 million equivalent,
about 53% of total project costs. The estimated costs of the principal
features of the project are shown in the table on the following page. The
total financing required, including interest during construction, is estimated
to be US$89.0 million.
Basis for Estimates
3.07      Project cost estimates, as of mid-1979, are based on actual contract
prices for the supply of equipment and the construction of the transmission
line and civil works, and have been estimated for the drilling, training,
engineering, and studies for further geothermal exploration and for the next
project. In general, price contingencies of 12% per annum were used for
foreign expenditures, and 12% per annum for 1979 and 10% for 1980-83 for local
expenditures. Physical contingencies of 5% were used for the mechanical-
electrical equipment and 7.5% for the switching station contracts which have
been awarded and where there is less likelihood of increased cost due to
unknown factors, and 10% was used on the local component of the civil and
transmission line contracts. The major contract, mechanical-electrical
equipment for Unit 1, has been awarded to Mitubishi on a firm price, i.e. zero
price escalation, for work completed in Japan, and with 12% escalation to be
applied for work in Kenya. KPC has an option to purchase second unit, and
price escalation of 12% has been included on the foreign funds to allow for
expected price increases which may occur until the date on which the option is
taken.

3.08      Prior to the resumption of work at Olkaria in March 1978, about
US$5.6 million was expended on studies, civil works, exploratory drilling,
the purchase of a drill rig, and the drilling of six wells. These costs have
not been included in the cost estimates for this project, and appear in KPC's
accounts as work in progress.
Financing
3.09      The proposed Bank loan of US$40 million would finance 54% of the
estimated project cost (US$74.7 million) and 90% of the estimated foreign
component of project cost (US$44.3 milion) in both cases excluding duties and
taxes, and interest during construction. Part of the loan would be used to
refinance a portion of the existing Bank loan of US$9.0 million (para. 3.02).
A proposed loan from the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) of
US$20.0 million equivalent, would provide financing for the remaining foreign
component of estimated cost, and for some local costs. The total external
financing would amount to US$60.0 million, about 75% of the project cost less
duties and taxes. This is in line with the level of external financing that
the Bank normally uses in Kenya. The Bank loan would be for 20 years with a
5-year grace period and would be made at an interest rate of 7.95% to KPC.
The CDC loan to KPC would be for 15 years with a 3-year grace period, and with
an interest rate of 8.5%. Local costs would be financed by a Development
Surcharge 1/ on electric power sold by KPC and TRDC to EAP&L, and a government
equity of Kb 3.0 million (US$8.0 million), and other short term borrowings.

3.11      There is sufficient steam available for the first 15 MW unit from
the 12 wells that have been completed (para. 3.14), but to date, the avail-
ability of steam for the second 15-MW unit has not yet been proven. Thus
there would be a condition in the Bank loan, that funds for Unit 2 may not
be committed until about 80% of the steam needed for both units (i.e. 24
MW) has been proven. The source and proposed allocation of funds is follows:
1/   The definition of Development Surcharge is in para. 6.09.  It would be
applied to power sold from 1980 to 1982 to cover part of the balance of
the project's local cost of Kb 7.8 million (US$21.0 million).

Status of Engineering and Construction Schedule
3.12      The construction schedule is based on full commercial operation
of the first unit by July 1, 1981 and the second on April 1, 1983. KPC is
most anxious that this schedule be maintained because, if the output of the
hydro plants is reduced by a dry year, there would be power shortages in the
early months of each year beginning in 1980 (para. 4.03). Details of the
construction schedule are given in Annex 3.3.
3.13      The project is being designed by Merz and McLellan of the U.K.
in association with Virkir of Iceland. It is estimated that of the total of
105,000 man-hours which would be required by the consultants for the design
and supervision of this project, approximately 37,000 man-hours would be
expended in Kenya, and the remainder in the consultants' offices in England
and Iceland. An estimated amount of US$1,000,000 in foreign funds and
US$100,000 in local funds would be disbursed from the preparatory work compo-
nent by the end of 1979, to cover the estimated 15,000 man-hours of the
consultants' time spent in Kenya and 40,000 man-hours in England and Iceland.
Geothermal Energy of New Zealand (GENZL) has been contracted to provide key
staff for the operation and maintenance of the drilling equipment and to train
local staff in its operation. Since the drilling program was reactivated in
early 1978, three of the six wells drilled in 1973-76 were successfully
rehabilitated. Subsequently, six more wells have been drilled, with the
eighth and ninth producing only a limited quantity of steam.
3.14      The production wells, drilled to a depth of 900 to 1,300 meters,
have required an average of two months for completion, including moving and
setup times as well as delays due to failures of the existing equipment. The
existing drill was purchased for the 1973-76 program and has been out of
service for maintenance frequently. When the second drill (funded under Loan
S-12-KE) is put into operation in the fall of 1980, the rate of completion of
production wells should be more than doubled. The output from the seven
successful wells completed to date is estimated to be capable of generating
about 16.7 MW, and progress on the project indicates that the on-line date of
July 1, 1981 for the first unit would be achieved. It is also projected that
sufficient steam will have been proven by October 1980 to enable KPC to order
the necessary mechanical and electrical equipment, and to contract the assoc-
iated civil works to enable the second 15-14W unit to be commissioned on
April 1, 1983. Funds have been included to cover the estimated costs of
drilling production wells until December 1982. These are estimated to provide
a 40% surplus of steam because the production from some wells may diminish
over time. Any excess would be available for the generation of additional
power at some future date. KPC hopes that additional funds may be obtained so
that the drilling of wells would continue beyond this date.
Procurement
3.15      All of the funds to be provided in the engineering project loan
(S-12-KE) will have been committed for the drill rig and accessories, drilling
supplies and consultants, and about US$2.5 million will have been disbursed by
the end of 1979. Implementation of this project has necessitated advance
contracting, so that the shipping date of long delivery items would not delay
the scheduled on-line date. In the President's Report for Loan S-12-KE, it



- 18 -
was estimated that about US$13.5 million would be required for advance contract-
ing. Upon receipt of tenders, however, it was found that the cost had increased
significantly. It is now estimated that the value of the contracts which have
been awarded, and which would be financed in part by funds from this loan,
amount to about US$22.0 million, of which US$14.0 million would be from the
loan and the remainder financed by others. For the generating station,
contracts have been awarded only for the construction and supply of equipment
for Unit 1, and an option is held for the supply of the mechanical and
electrical equipment for Unit 2. The contract price for the second unit would
be adjusted in accordance with labor and material indices for work completed
in Japan, and in Kenya. No additional work would be required in the switching
station or for the transmission line for the commissioning of Unit 2.

3.16      Retroactive financing is recommended to cover the estimated expendi-
tures of about US$2 million needed for the initial costs of the contracts for
the mechanical-electrical equipment, switching station engineering, and
studies for the next power project. Prosurement for work and material to be
financed under the Bank loan has been or would be in accordance with Bank
guidelines for international competitive bidding. In bid comparison of
equipment procured through international competitive bidding, domestic manu-
facturers have been allowed a preferential margin of 15% or the existing
customs duty, whichever is lower, over the c.i.f. price of competing imports.
However, only the civil works and roads and housing contracts have been
awarded locally due to the very specialized nature of the equipment and
supplies involved. Contracts of less than about US$100,000 (expected to total
about US$3.0 million) for miscellaneous drilling equipment and supplies would
be awarded on the basis of the Bank's limited competitive bidding procedures.



- 19 -
Disbursements
3.17      The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed over four years on the
following basis: 100% of the foreign component of the cost of the drill rig,
drilling operations, mechanical electrical contracts, switching station, engi-
neering design and supervision, training, and studies for further geothermal
production wells and for the next power project. The remaining foreign costs
would be disbursed from CDC funds. KPC would not exercise the option
held for the supply of mechanical and electrical equipment for Unit 2 until
such time that a supply for the generation of 24 NW of electrical power (i.e.
80% of station capacity) is proven to be available (para 7.01 (a)). A dis-
bursement schedule may be found in Annex 3.
Environmental Considerations
3.18      There are no inhabitants in the immediate area of the proposed
power station, the vegetation is sparse, and except for a few zebra, there is
little wildlife. Thus, the disposal of gases in the air, particularly the
hydrogen sulphide, would cause little harm to man or animal life. The equip-
ment which may be affected by this gas would require air-tight seals so that
they may operate effectively. Special attention has been given to the problem
of hydrogen sulphide in the design of the station so as to eliminate unven-
tilated areas, and deep pits or trenches where the gas may accumulate.
Disposal of gases would normally be through a 50-foot high chimney which has
been designed to provide adequate dispersion and dilution so as to conform
with recommended allowable ground level concentrations. Periodically, it
would be necessary to blow off steam for pressure stabilization and well
maintenance, but with suitable protection the noise would be within acceptable
limits for the operators, who would normally be stationed in an air-conditioned
control room. Housing for the operating staff would be located some distance
away so that objectionable gases would be diffused and seldom reach the area,
and the noise level much reduced. Waste water containing large quantities of
salts would be piped to a nearby depression where the water would seep into
the ground. The underground flow in this area is away from Lake Naivasha, so
there is no possibility of contaminating the lake. However, if this effluent
were to reappear on the surface, proper measures would be taken to dispose of it.
IV. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
The Power Market
4.01      Kenya's Fourth Development Plan, 1979-1983, indicates that the
target for economic growth is 6.3%, which is the average rate of growth of the
economy since independence. While the nation's output of goods and services
between 1964 and 1967 averaged an annual increase of 5.8%, the growth rate
between 1972 and 1977 was only 4.7%. From 1972-1976, the average growth in
demand for energy was 8.0% (para. 2.07). Based on a review of the available
data, including the anticipated rate of industrial development, the mission
agreed that there was no reason to change the forecast as prepared by the
consultants in their report on the National Power Development Plan dated
May 1978 (para. 2.10). Therefore, these forecasts were used to determine the
requirements for new energy sources, the economic and financial feasibility,
and the financial projections.



- 20 -
Need for Additional Capacity
4.02      The generation of electricity in the interconnected system is
primarily by hydroelectric plants augmented by a large steam-generating plant
in Mombasa, a gas turbine and diesel installations in Nairobi and other
isolated diesel installations (para. 2.05). While it is possible to meet the
maximum demand, the National Power Development Plan (para. 2.10) indicates
that the firm energy capability of the existing generating plant was below
the requirement in 1977 and 1978, and that the shortfall would continue to
increase as the need grew larger in future years. In assessing the capability
of existing plant, the consultants took into account the need to have the
installed capacity of generating plant in the system greater than the maximum
demand, in order that units may be withdrawn from service for planned main-
tenance and to have capacity available for unforeseen forced outages. The
time required for the planned maintenance was based on an average of a large
number of installations, while the reliability data published by the Edison
Electric Institute of USA was used to estimate the frequency of forced outages
of the various types of generating equipment. Both of these assumptions give
an optimistic result for the frequency and duration for out-of-service condi-
tions and, therefore, the possibility of shortfall in energy would appear to
be somewhat greater than that forecast by the consultants.
4.03      Depending on the Tana River flows, there is a possibility of four
years in thirty that there could be a deficiency in firm energy of about 100
GWh in 1980. Therefore, the mission agrees that Kenya needs new generating
facilities as soon as possible.
4.04      A tabulation of the forecast of demand and production capability is
shown in Annex 2.2, monthly for an average water year in Annex 2.3 and in chart
form for a dry year in Annex 2.4.
Comparison of Alternatives
4.05      The need for additional generating capacity (para. 4.03) requires
the development of either geothermal, diesel or gas turbine installations or
some combination which would satisfy the demand. A conventional coal-fired
steam plant would take too long to commission. The next 'Logical hydro plant,
Kiambere, has not been studied in detail and could not be brought into service
soon enough to meet the expected shortfalls. In 1978, gas turbine fuel costs
were KIE 41,000/GWh and diesel fuel costs were KE 20,200/GWh for the existing
equipment in Kenya, indicating that choice was limited and that only two
possibilities, geothermal or diesel, should be considered. The comparison was
prepared on the following basis, using the estimated cost for the diesel
alternative as shown in Annex 4.1:
(a) Interest during construction, escalation, and duties and
taxes were not included;
(b) The equivalent geothermal production in the case of the diesel
alternative would be provided as follows: 80% from the



- 21 -
Kipevu steam plant in Mombasa, and 20% from a diesel gener-
ating plant located close to the demand so that transmission
costs may be disregarded;
(c)  Cost of steam plant fuel at Kb 15,675/Gwh and diesel fuel
at KL 24,750/Gwh in July 1979.
(d)  Shadow prices were used for foreign exchange. 1/
(e)  Salvage value of drill rig and accessories assumed to be
K1E 1.5 million (US$4.0 million) in 1984.
4.06      With interest rates up to 25%, the least cost solution was found to
be the geothermal project, which is much higher than the opportunity cost of
capital in Kenya, estimated to be 12%. Sensitivity tests have been carried
out to determine the effect of a 10% increase in estimated capital cost,
compared with the diesel alternative with a 10% reduction in fuel costs, and
the geothermal alternative remains the least cost solution at discount rates
up to about 23% (Annex 4.2).
4.07      The costs used in the foregoing analysis include all capital costs
expended since March 1978 when KPC decided to reactivate the project. An
alternative approach would be to consider all costs expended prior to Sep-
tember 1979 as "sunk costs" and, therefore, not included in the calculations.
On this basis, the equalizing discount rate would be about 34%. An increase
in the capital cost of the project of 10% and a decrease in fuel costs of 10%
lowers the equalizing discount rate to about 31% (Annex 4.3).
Economic Rate of Return
4.08      The economic rate of return, relating the economic project capital
and operating costs to the savings and revenues expected from it were cal-
culated, taking into account the following assumptions. During most of the
year, the existing generating plant is capable of meeting the demand for
energy, and for the next few years, energy from Olkaria would be needed to
meet the requirements of the system only during the periods of low river
flow. The sale of energy from Olkaria is expected to begin with an estimated
50 Gwh in 1981 rising to 190 Gwh in 1984, but for computation of the benefits,
it has been assumed that only 20% of this energy would produce an incremental
revenue. The revenue was determined by reducing the rated output of the
project by the estimated losses in the transmission and distribution system,
and multiplying the resulting kilowatt hour output by EAP&L's average sales
price per Kwh. During the remaining 80% of the time, instead of generating
expensive energy in the steam plant and diesel stations, the energy from
Olkaria would be used. The annual reduction in system operating costs due
to the fuel savings was determined by arbitrarily assuming that 80% of the
1/   Shadow foreign exchange rate KSh 10.50 = US$1.00 compared to current
rate of KSh 7.5 = US$1.00.



- 22 -
Olkaria energy output would displace steam plant fuel and 20% would displace
diesel fuel, using the KPC fuel costs for July 1979. A new thermal plant is
scheduled to be commissioned in 1987, and therefore, the station output was
assumed to be 100% revenue-producing from that date onwards. The economic
rate of return is about 11%, using the 1979 tariff structure averaging KSh
0.42 per kWh.  Shadow prices were used for foreign exchange.  Shadow prices
were not applied to unskilled labor because their application would have
little effect on the rate of return.  When the sensitivity of the rate of
return was tested using the 1979 tariff, it was found that an increase in the
capital cost of the project by 10% and a decrease in benefits of 10% reduces
the economic rate of return to about 10%.
4.09      The method used to determine the rate of return on investment
and the assumptions made are detailed in Annex 4.4.
Risk
4.10      There are two quite different degrees of risk associated with the
physical development of this project. The first is for the powerhouse,
switching station and transmission line which would be moderate and no dif-
ferent from other typical thermal generating projects. There would be a
greater unknown, however, for the production wells and associated controls and
steam-gathering system.
4.11      The greatest unknown is the amount and characteristics of the steam
which may be obtained from new wells drilled in the future, some of which may
be failures. Although the wells would be lined with steel pipe, some plugging
of the wells may take place after a period of time because calcite and silica
will precipitate where the hot water flashes into steam, retarding the flow.
The Olkaria site could be subject to earthquake shocks of an intensity from
VIII to IX on the modified Mercalli scale, which means that there would be
moderate to severe damage to buildings not specifically designed to withstand
such forces.  Therefore, the buildings and equipment for the project would
be designed to withstand the acceleration forces due to the expected earth
tremors, without failure or distortion, in accordance to the Kenya Code of
Practice for the Design and Construction of Buildings and other Structures
in Relation to Earthquakes. If a tremor were to occur, the flow of steam
might actually be improved by additional shattering of the rock, but the
flow could be cut off entirely if the well casing is sheared off or crushed.
This would only be likely if the well intersected an active geological
fault. The life of the materials and equipment in contact with the live
steam would be shortened considerably due to the corrosive nature of the
suspended water carried by the steam, particularly when units are shut down,
and if air enters the piping system.
4.12      The risks foreseen in this project would be minimized by the employ-
ment of GENZL and Virkir with extensive experience in similar geothermal work in
New Zealand and Iceland, and Merz and McLellan who have had extensive experience
in the design of conventional thermal power plants. Three of the original six
well have little flow, and two of the recently completed six wells have
minimum output, although it is expected that with further work, the power
potential from these two may be increased. The remaining seven wells have



- 23 -
been producing steam for an extended period and are estimated to be capable
of producing 16.7 MW.  Although the vast hot water reservoir (300 C) may be
considered to provide an endless supply of steam, it is expected that the
productive capability of each well will gradually decrease as the steam flow
carries particulate matter into the crevices in the rock and dissolved salts
are precipitated, obstructing the flow. In order to reduce the risk expected
from the corrosive nature of the steam, the potential suppliers of the equipment
were invited to place various samples of steels with different chemical
content in a testing chamber, where they have been exposed to flowing steam
for periods extending over six months. The results of these tests have been
used for the selection of materials for various components of the project. In
some cases, it would be more economical to use mild steel and replace the item
periodically as necessary, rather than use a costly material.
4.13      In addition, there are slight institutional risks relating to
EAP&L and KPC's capability to properly administer this and other projects in
the development program and their continued financial viability. Several
changes in management took place (para 5.10) to ensure continued and improved
operating functions. A training component is included in this project (para
5.14) to assist in the upgrading of present staff at all levels in the
organization, and ensure that the expected growth of all three organizations
would not be hindered by a shortage of qualified employees. As to the
financial viability, EAP&L's record of timely tariff revisions to maintain a
sound financial position has been satisfactory. The rate of return covenant
proposed for this project (para 6.08) would help to ensure that EAP&L and KPC
continue to have a sound financial position in the future.
V. THE BORROWER - THE KENYA POWER COMPANY, LIMITED
Structure of the Electricity Supply Industry
5.01      The East African Power and Lighting Company, Limited (EAP&L), which
is the sole distributor of electricity in Kenya, was founded in 1922 by the
amalgamation of two private companies which had supplied Nairobi and Mombasa
since 1907 and 1909. Both the Kenya Power Company, Limited (KPC) and the
Tana River Development Company, Limited (TRDC) were established by EAP&L,
the former in 1955 principally to finance the interconnection with Uganda and
sell imported power to EAP&L, and the latter in 1964 to develop the potential
of the Tana River. At the time these companies were formed, the stock of
EAP&L was privately owned by a large number of shareholders. Almost all of
the capital raised for KPC and TRDC was loan capital. EAP&L shared the
ownership of the nominal equity with a private financing company and the
Government, which became the owner of one third of KPC's equity capital and
one quarter of TRDC's. In 1969 the Government decided to obtain control of
EAP&L by purchasing the available shares on the London stock register, and
became in July 1979, the majority shareholder in the company. Subsequently,
the Government acquired the total equity of KPC and TRDC in February 1971.
Since establishment, both companies have been managed and staffed by EAP&L
under a management agreement. A brief description of the history of the
power companies is in Annex 5.1.



- 24 -
5.02      Government has accepted that rationalization of the structure of
the power industry could best be achieved by integrating all three companies,
which already operate for all practical purposes as one company. However,
this cannot be achieved immediately; about US$3.3 million of debenture stock
in KPC is held by outside shareholders. Government intends to retire these
debentures when the merger of TRDC and KPC can proceed. In the case of EAP&L,
Government and its associated institutions, which together hold about 60% of
the equity, are continuing to buy up shares on the Nairobi register as and
when these become available. The target for the merger of all three companies
is difficult to forecast but the present arrangement, while complicated, is
operating efficiently and it is not of significant importance if the merger
cannot be achieved in the short term.
5.03      EAP&L purchases the entire output of KPC and TRDC at what is called
the "ascertained cost" (Annex 6.7 for definition) and is the only company with
surplus revenue-earning capacity. The funds required to enable the proposed
borrower to cover its operating expenses, pay its debt service and meet the
local currency costs of the project must therefore come from EAP&L, and
appropriate arrangments are necessary to assure KPC's revenues. These matters
have been discussed with the Government and EAP&L during negotiations, and
agreement has been obtained on the continuation of the "development surcharge"
to meet the needs of KPC's development program (para. 6.09).
5.04      It was confirmed during negotiations that a generating station
license, which is required under the Electric Power Act, would be issued in
respect of the project before December 31, 1980 (para. 7.Dlb).
Organization and Management
5.05      EAP&L is a well-managed utility and is operated in accordance with
sound commercial principles. The Chairman, a Kenyan, is a competent admin-
istrator. The Board of Directors consists of nine members including the
Chairman and General Manager of the company and two government representa-
tives; the remaining five members are leading Kenyan businessmen.
5.06      The staff of EAP&L at December 31, 1978, inclusive of staff attached
to KPC and TRDC, numbered 3,525 which includes 56 expatriate staff. There has
been a significant reduction in expatriate staff as evidenced by the fact that
in 1970 there were 189 expatriate professional staff, and 120 in 1974. There
were 845 employees in the generation department, 1,332 in the distribution
department, with the remainder in various administrative positions in the
organization. The number of metered connections was 141,727 and there were
about 40 consumers per employee. This compares favorably with some of the
other East African companies 1/ and is reasonable considering the number of
installations (some 21 power stations spread over Kenya), the distances
involved, the amount of construction work carried out by the company, and
staff training needs.

-25 -
5.07      Maintaining the establishment at full strength and, at the same
time, avoiding a deterioration in the quality of staff are continuing problems.
Departing expatriate staff have generally been replaced with qualified local
staff, but there are a number of vacancies which EAP&L is having difficulty
in filling with suitable candidates either locally or from abroad. For these
reasons, the standard of management of the companies has remained about the
same since the Gitaru project was appraised in 1974.
5.08      There is no quick solution to this problem, and the situation can
only be relieved as the establishment becomes progressively more Kenyanized.
In the meantime, EAP&L will have to rely on expatriates for some years
but to a decreasing extent as Kenyans are trained to replace them (para.
5.14).
5.09      The present staff are competent to operate the companies, to carry
out the project with the assistance of consultants, and to carry out other
works covered by EAP&L's development program. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that KPC will continue to employ consultants satisfactory
to the Bank in carrying out the project. In addition, KPC has appointed a
resident project manager to be responsible for overall supervision and coordi-
nation of the drilling and steam production aspects of the project (para.
7.01c).
5.10      In January 1978, the Montreal Engineering Company, Limited sub-
mitted a report entitled "Management and Accounting Consultancy Study" which
contains comments and recommended changes to the structure of the organiza-
tion, the accounting functions, and the management reporting systems of
EAP&L. In general, the report found that the company functions were reason-
ably well organized but suggested that certain activities might be better
handled if assigned to other departments. The report has been studied
by EAP&L during the past year, and the introduction of many of the recommenda-
tions, including a restructuring of the company by the creation of six
functional divisions to replace nine departments took place on July 1, 1979.
5.11      EAP&L has provided assurances that it will continue to operate in
accordance with sound business, public utility, financial and insurance
practices, and exchange information with the Bank. A satisfactory management
agreement between EAP&L and KPC is already in force, and a condition of
effectiveness would be an extension of this agreement to include operation
and management of the proposed project (para. 7.02(a)).
Accounts and Audit
5.12      It was agreed for IBRD Loan 745-KE and Loan 1147-KE (for TRDC's
Kamburu and Gitaru projects, respectively) that the financial statements of
TRDC and KPC, individually and combined, would be prepared on depreciation
accounting basis and that the financial statements of TRDC/KPC, as so prepared,
would be combined with those of EAP&L. It was also agreed that the annual
accounts of TRDC, KPC and EAP&L, including the accounts on depreciation basis



- 26 -
for TRDC and KPC, would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank and that copies of the certified financial statements and of the auditors'
reports would be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of the
financial year.  Since TRDC and KPC now prepare their accounts on a deprecia-
tion accounting basis, it has been agreed that EAP&L, TRDC and KPC would in
future continue to submit their audited accounts to the Bank within six months
of the end of the financial year, with combined accounts statements of KPC/TRDC
and KPC/TRDC/EAP&L and that the combined accounts statemencs would not be
required to be audited (para. 7.01 (e).  The performance of the accountants,
Gill and Johnson, who currently audit the accounts of the three companies, has
been generally satisfactory and they are acceptable to the Bank.
Training
5.13      EAP&L has several training programs designed to produce qualified
staff to meet the company's normal growth and to compensate for the frequent
loss of employees to other sectors of the economy because of salary differen-
tials. The cost of training in 1978 was KE 490,000 for 156 trainees. Of
these, there were 23 students at university and 9 graduate apprentices pri-
marily in mechanical and electrical engineering. The 127 trainees in the
Technicians Training Program are sponsored by EAP&L at the polytechnical
schools in Nairobi and Mombasa. Candidates who do not meet the requirements
for training as technicians are apprenticed as linemen, mechanical and elec-
trical fitters, welders, etc. Middle and senior managers attend management
courses conducted by the Kenya Institute of Administration and the East
African Management Institute.
5.14      KPC would use funds from the loan to enlarge the foregoing programs
so as to provide the necessary skilled manpower that is needed at all levels
within the utility. Particular emphasis would be placed on the training of
operators and maintenance personnel because KPC staff are unfamiliar with this
type of project. Special attention would also be given to training additional
staff as linemen for the distribution department. Agreement has been reached
on the training of staff of EAP&L, and the extension of on-going training
programs both in Kenya and abroad.
Insurance
5.15      The three power companies maintain sufficient coverage against loss
through fire, machinery breakdown, special perils (such as earthquakes) as
well as against consequential loss, in addition to coverage for such things as
their motor vehicle fleet, workmen's compensation, personal accidents, third
party liability, etc.
Project Monitoring System
5.16      EAP&L has agreed to the project monitoring system which is pre-
sented in Annex 5.2 and to the requirements of the Completion Report.

VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Introduction
6.01      The activities of the three companies comprising the public power
supply in Kenya are closely connected through common management. The finan-
cial position of the borrower, KPC, should not therefore be evaluated in
isolation but jointly with that of TRDC and EAP&L. Financial statements of
KPC and consolidated statements for all the three companies combined, covering
the period 1975 through 1978 (actual) and 1979 through 1984 (estimated), are
presented in Annexes 6.1 to 6.6. Assumptions made in these statements are
given in Annex 6.7 together with explanatory notes.
6.02      The revenues of KPC and TRDC are determined on the basis of "ascer-
tained cost" as defined in their respective bulk-supply agreements. Ascer-
tained cost (Annex 6.7), described briefly, comprises operation and admin-
istration costs, interest and redemption payments for debt, income and other
taxes and an amount to meet abnormal expenses and a part of the development
expenses. The two bulk supply companies, while separate legal entities,
should, for all practical purposes, be considered a single unit since they are
both wholly owned by the Government, have similar nature of operations, and
sell the entire energy purchased or generated by them to a single entity,
EAP&L.
Past Operations and Present Financial Position
6.03      As will be seen from Annex 6.1, net assets (fixed assets, invest-
ments and working capital) of KPC are estimated at about KL 14 million at the
end of 1979. Most of these assets were financed by borrowing, all of which debt
is payable in sterling. Net gain from the devaluation of UK pound from time
to time since 1967 is reflected as a part of equity. The debt equity ratio at
the end of 1979 is expected to be 17/83. By the end of 1983, after completion
of the project, net assets are expected to be about KL 48 million and the debt
equity ratio 46/54, which is satisfactory. However, it is more significant to
consider the financial position of KPC on a combined basis with the other two
companies (para. 6.05).
6.04      During the three years 1975 to 1977, the rate of return earned
by EAP&L, 7.3%, 2.2% and 7.3% respectively, was lower than for the bulk supply
companies, which was 8.3%, 7.4% and 9.2%, respectively. This resulted from
payment of the development surcharge to TRDC during these years which was more
than the amount required to equalize the rate. The financial covenants of the
IBRD Loan 1147-KE required a minimum rate of return of 8.5% on average net
fixed assets revalued annually, including work in progress for EAP&L as well
as KPC and TRDC combined. These requirements are being modified for the
proposed loan (paras. 6.06, 6.09 and 6.14).



- 28 -
6.05      The combined balance sheet contained in Annex 6.4 shows that, at the
end of 1979, the total net assets of the three companies are expected to be KE
171 million and the debt equity ratio 35/65. It is apparent, therefore, that
on a combined basis, the three companies are conservatively capitalized.
6.06      The effect of currency rate fluctuations in the past has had no
adverse effect on the foreign currency debt of the three companies, as the
official rate of exchange of the Kenya shilling has remained quite stable.
The rate of return covenant (para. 6.09) for this loan repeats the provision
for the annual revaluation of assets on a price index, agreed between EAP&L
and the Bank, which takes into account the increases in the replacement cost
of fixed assets (para. 7.01f).
6.07      Annex 6.4 indicates that the three companies havre adequate working
capital and satisfactory cash positions. There has been good control of
debtors; accounts receivable amounted to only a little more than two months'
billing at the end of 1978. Net income of the three companies for the years
1975, 1976, 1977 and 1978 (Annex 6.5), expressed in million KE, was 3.1,
3.1, 6.0 and 9.3 as against the estimates (prepared during the appraisal of
the Gitaru Project in 1974) of 2.4, 4.2, 4.4 and 6.7 respectively, and shows a
satisfactory position.
EAP&L's Tariffs
6.08      On the basis of power tariff study completed by the Bank in 1977,
a tariff structure, taking into consideration long-term marginal costs, was
introduced throughout the country in January 1979. This is estimated to bring
in an average revenue of 42 Kenya cents or 6 US cents per kWh in 1979. 1/ A
fuel oil surcharge can be added to the tariff to allow EAP&L to recover from
its consumers the bulk of any increase in the cost of fuel used in power
generation. The electricity tariff structure is described in Annex 6.8.
EAP&L, while accepting the need for future tariff adjustments, indicated that
it would not be able to meet in the future the minimum rate of return of 8.5%
required by the financial covenants of IBRD loan 1147-KE (para. 6.04). The
Bank accepted this position and agreed to lower rates of return (para. 6.14)
since working capital and cash positions are at acceptable levels (para. 6.07).
EAP&L has, in the past, made timely adjustments to its tariffs in an effort to
meet agreed rate of return requirements and is expected to make appropriate
tariff increases in the future.
1/   Electricity tariffs for some other East African countries converted at
official exchange rates into US cents per kWh are: Botswana 3, Malawi
5, Mauritius 9, Sudan 10, Swaziland 3, Tanzania 6.



- 29 -
Proposed Financing Plan
6.09      The financing plan includes a 10% increase in EAP&L's tariffs from
July 1, 1980 and further annual increases by an average of 20%, 9%, 11% and
13% from January 1, 1981 through January 1, 1984 1/ respectively, continuation
of the development surcharge payable by EAP&L to the bulk supply companies,
issue of further KPC equity subscriptions of par value KL 1.75 million to the
Government of Kenya and a CDC loan, a part of which would be used to finance
local currency expenditure. To help finance TRDC's development projects,
EAP&L has in the past paid annually to TRDC a development surcharge which was
computed so that it provided the two bulk supply companies, TRDC and KPC, with
a rate of return which was similar to that of EAP&L. The development surcharge
which was being paid to help finance the Gitaru project was discontinued after
1978 as that project was completed in mid-1978.  EAP&L has suggested that it
should continue to pay the development surcharge to help finance the proposed
project and that from 1980, the surcharge should be paid to KPC and that, to
simplify calculation of its amount, it should be paid at a rate of 2 Kenya
cents per Kwh of energy supplied to EAP&L by the two bulk supply companies.
However, as the requirement of funds would vary from year to year depending on
the pattern of disbursements and other factors, EAP&L's suggestion was accepted
subject to the further requirement that, should this amount not prove adequate
to provide the local currency funds needed for the proposed project in any
particular year, EAP&L would provide additional funds required up to an
amount which would make the rate of return of the two bulk supply companies
in respect of any year equal to 8.5% of their average revalued net fixed
assets in operation (para. 7.01g). Thus, the local currency costs of the
project are proposed to be provided by continuation of the development sur-
charge, an equity subscription by the Government of Ki 3 million and a local
currency amount of K1 4.3 million in the CDC loan. The Government has paid to
KPC K 1.25 million as equity subscription in 1978 and has agreed to contribute
additional equity subscriptions of KE 1.25 million in 1979 and K1 0.5 million
in 1980 (para. 7.01h).
6.10      A forecast of KPC's sources and application of funds for the period
1979 to 1984 is presented in Annex 6.3. The financing plan of KPC for the
project construction period 1979-1982, along with that of the three companies
combined, follows:
1/   Assuming an annual price escalation rate of 10%, the level of electricity
tariffs in real terms would remain close to 1980 levels after the proposed
tariff increases.

6.11      It is appropriate to consider the financing plan on the basis
of the combined sources and requirements of the three companies, eliminating
inter-company transactions as though they were merged into one company. The
forecast of the combined requirements and sources of funds on this basis,
of KPC, TRDC and EAP&L for the period 1979-1984, is presented in Annex 6.6.
The summarized financing plan of the three companies, given in the table in the
preceding paragraph, shows that of the total construction and working capital
requirements of the three companies for 1979-1982, 38% would be financed by
net internal cash generation after providing for debt service and dividends,
2% from increase in share capital, 1% from CIDA grants and the balance by
borrowings: 16% by the proposed IBRD loan, 7% by a loan from CDC, 30% by
other loans which are available to EAP&L and TRDC or are in the process of
being negotiated; and 6% from an unidentified loan which would be required for
the Kiambere Project. Completion of cofinancing arrangements for the proposed
project is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan (para. 7.02b).
As indicated in Annex 6.6, the internal cash generation covers the annual debt
service requirements by an ample margin, ranging from an estimated 1.7 times in
1979 to about 3.5 times in 1984, which is adequate.
6.12      If additional funds are required to complete the project because of
cost overruns, or due to outside loans and credits being insufficient,
the Government has guaranteed that it will provide the additional financing
requirement in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to the Bank (para.
7.Oli).
Future Earnings
6.13      Forecasts of revenues and expenses are attached for KPC (Annex 6.2)
and for the three companies combined (Annex 6.5). The development surcharge
has been calculated to provide KPC and TRDC with funds required by them for
their capital development programs and EAP&L's tariffs adjusted to provide a
minimum rate of return on average net fixed assets in operation of 7%
in 1981 and 1982 and 8% in 1983 and 1984.
6.14      EAP&L has undertaken to ensure that the combined net operating
income of the three companies, KPC, TRDC and EAP&L, will be not less than 6%
of their combined average revalued net fixed assets in operation in 1980, 7%
in 1981 and 1982 and 8% thereafter. The Government has agreed that it will
take or cause to be taken all actions necessary to permit EAP&L to obtain
revenues sufficient to yield these rates of return (para. 7.01j). For this
purpose, the depreciation amount used to determine operating income would be
on revalued amount of fixed assets.
Debt Limitation
6.15      Debt service coverage is relevant only in relation to the combined
position of the three companies,particularly because of the rate of return
requirement for KPC/TRDC and EAP&L (para. 6.14) and the debt service of the



- 32 -
bulk supply companies, KPC/TRDC, being payable by EAP&L as a part of ascer-
tained cost (Annex 6.7). In line with the requirements of IBRD Loan 1147-KE
for the Gitaru project of TRDC, no long-term debt may be incurred by
EAP&L, TRDC, KPC (or any similar company which may be established in the
future as a bulk licensee selling power to EAP&L) without prior Bank approval,
unless cash earnings before provision for depreciation are at least 1.5 times
the maximum debt service for any succeeding fiscal year, on all debt including
the debt to be incurred. This test is made on the basis of combined revenue
accounts and debt service after eliminating inter-company payments. The debt
service coverage of the three companies is expected to be well above 1.5
and a similar covenant has been incorporated for the proposed IBRD loan (para.
7.01k).
Security Arrangements
6.16      Annex 6.9 describes the security arrangements for the loan capital
of EAP&L,KPC and TRDC. The outstanding foreign debt of KPC is estimated to
be about US$7.8 million equivalent in 1977 of which about US$3.3 million
is secured by a floating charge or lien on all present and future assets.
It has been agreed with KPC that if any lien is created in the future on any
of its assets as security for any debt, such lien would eqlually and ratably
secure the proposed loan (para. 7.011).
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Agreements Reached
7.01      Agreement was reached by the Bank, the Government, EAP&L and KPC
that:
(a)  Commitment of funds from the proposed loan for Unit 2 of the
power generation plant, included in the project, would be made
only after assurance is received that about 80% of the steam
required for two units would be available (para. 3.16);
(b)  KPC would be issued a generating station license, in respect of
the project, required under the Electric Power Act before
December 31, 1980 (para. 5.04);
(c)  EAP&L would continue to employ consultants satisfactory to the
Bank in carrying out the project. KPC has appointed an engi-
neering expert to be responsible for the supervision of the
drilling and steam production aspects of the project (para.
5.09);
(d)  EAP&L would continue to operate in accordance with sound business,
public utility, financial and insurance practices; and exchange
information with the Bank (para. 5.11);



- 33 -
(e) Auditors satisfactory to the Bank would be employed and copies of
annual financial statements of KPC, TRDC and EAP&L with auditors'
reports thereon, together with combined statements of KPC/TRDC
and KPC/TRDC/EAP&L, would be submitted to the Bank (para. 5.12);
(f) Fixed assets of the three companies would continue to be revalued
for the purpose of determining rate of return (para. 6.06);
(g) EAP&L would pay a development surcharge to KPC during the
construction period of the proposed project to provide a part of
KPC's requirements of local currency funds for the project (para.
6.09);
(h) The Government would contribute an additional KE 1.75 million
for KPC's equity capital (para. 6.09);
(i) The Government would provide additional funds, if required, to
complete the proposed project (para. 6.12);
(j) Minimum annual rate of return are to be earned by the three
power companies on a combined basis as follows: 6% in 1980, 7%
in 1981 and 1982 and 8% thereafter; and timely tariff adjustments
are to be made to achieve this rate (para. 6.14);
(k) Debt limitation covenant of Loan 1147-KE would be repeated
(para. 6.15); and
(1) Equal and ratable security for the proposed loan would be made
if any lien were created in the future on KPC's assets (para.
6.16).
7.02      The following are conditions of effectiveness of the loan:
(a) Extension of the management agreement between EAP&L and KPC
(para. 5.11);
(b) Completion of cofinancing arrangements (para. 6.11).
Recommendation
7.03      With the above agreements, the project is suitable for a Bank loan
of US$40 million equivalent for a term of twenty years including a grace
period of five years.

KENYA
OLKARIA GEOTHERMAL POWER PROJECT
Description of Project
1.        This project, because of its extended nature, has three distinct
phases: the first, preparatory works; the second, relating to Unit 1
and the third to Unit 2. Commitment for Unit 2 would not be made until
about 80% of the steam required for two units has been proven. In summary,
the phases are as follows:
Preparatory Works
(1) the provision of a new drill rig, equipment and supplies;
(2) the drilling of production wells for steam supply;
(3) consultants.
Unit No. 1
(1) a gathering system to bring the steam from the wells to
the powerhouse;
(2) a powerhouse for one 15-MW unit;
(3) installation of one 15-MW turbine generator and associated
controls;
(4) a switching station;
(5) housing and access roads;
(6) 26 km of 132-kV transmission line;
(7) consulting engineering;
Unit No. 2
(1) drilling of production wells;
(2) the second 15-MW turbine generator and its associated
equipment and minor civil works;
(3)  consulting engineering.
Training and Studies
(1) training of KPC management and staff;
(2) studies of further geothermal potential and for the next
power project.
Characteristics of the Geothermal Field
2.       2Although the Olkaria geothermal field extends over an area exceed-
ing 50 km , the area of 2the reservoir being considered for development at
this time is some 12 km . Under this region, circulating ground water is



- 39 -
ANNEX 3.1
Page 2 of 3
heated by the hot rock to a temperature of about 3000C and is almost wholly
contained by a nearly impervious caprock about 700 meters below grade. Some
steam escapes through fissures and fractures in the rock and appears at the
ground surface in scattered locations. The volume of escaping steam is
replaced by water from Lake Naivasha seeping down through porous sections
of the bedrock. At depth, the water is saline and contains fluoride,
calcium, magnesium and sulphate salts. The steam contains non-condensable
gases, the most dominant being carbon dioxide, but hydrogen, hydrogen-
sulphide and methane are also present. Scaling of silica and calcite can
be expected when the pressure is reduced and the water flashes into steam.
Long-term tests at the existing well-heads have been conducted to determine
the appropriate operating pressures to minimize scaling.
Preparatory Works
3.        Between 1970 and 1976 approximately US$5.6 million were expended
in studies and in drilling six production wells and associated works.
These costs have not been included in the estimates for this project. The
cost of drilling additional production wells, a new drilling rig and
associated equipment and materials sufficient to operate until the end of
1980 is included in the Engineering Loan S-12-KE. Each production well is
22" in diameter at the top and reduces in several steps to 8-3/4" in
diameter 900 to 1,300 meters below ground level. As the well is drilled, a
steel liner is concreted in place, beginning with an 18-1/2" O.D. casing at
the top. The lower end of the well contains a slotted 7" O.D. diameter
casing which is not concreted, allowing the steam to flow into the casing.
Well-head Equipment and Steam Gathering System
4.        The equipment at the top of each well would consist mainly of a
steam and water separator, an exhaust silencer, control valves, testing and
measuring devices. The steam would be conveyed to the powerhouse through
a system of insulated pipelines, and designed to take advantage of the
topography, and allow for expansion and contraction.
Powerhouse and Equipment
5.        The equipment for this station would require a rather simple
steel structure with no major civil works. Initially, only the structure
for Unit 1 would be erected to house the turbine and generator, associated
control equipment and a small workshop. The 15-MW turbo-generator has been
designed using materials specially selected to withstand the corrosive and
erosive characteristics of the steam emitted from the production wells.
The site is about 7 km from Lake Naivasha, and therefore a system with
a forced draft cooling tower would be the most economical solution to meet
the cooling requirements. Make-up water would not be required because the
condensate would exceed the water lost in evaporation.

Electrical Installation
6.        Considerable cost savings in switching and transformers have been
achieved by connecting the two 15-MW units to a single 36-MVA transformer,
stepping up to 132 kV. Suitable circuit breakers at Olkaria and the sub-
station at Naivasha allow for convenient maintenance and adequate fault
protection.
Transmission Line
7.        The 132-kV transmission line would be constructed from material
salvaged from part of a 275-kV line which requires removal because of the
flooding of the Upper Reservoir. Several new galvanized steel towers and
a quantity of new conductor, insulators and miscellaneous hardware would
be required. The shortest route for the transmission line from Olkaria to
Naivasha, where it will join the Nairobi to Uganda transmission line, is
through Hell's Gate Gorge, a distance of 20 km. However, by a short diversion
of about 2 km, the line would bypass this frequently visited tourist attraction
and leave it in its natural state.
Training and Studies
8.        During the course of the work, a complete reevaluation of the
geothermal field would be made, taking into account all of the additional
information that has been gathered since drilling was resumed in March
1978. The information has been continually assessed as work progresses
but a more complete and in-depth review is now required. Funds have been
included to prepare a feasibility study of the Kiambere Project forecast
in the National Power Development Plan to be required by 1984. The project
would be compared with further geothermal or conventional thermal genera-
tion to determine the most desirable solution to the need for increased
power generation. Training would continue in the operation and maintenance
of the drilling equipment. Specific training in various trades and for
technical and management personnel would be carried out in Nairobi, Mombasa
and overseas as required.
Unit 2
9.        KPC has an option to purchase the second unit which could be
exercised any time prior to February 1, 1981. A decision would be required by
the Bank in the fall of 1980 on the advisability of committing funds for the
purchase of Unit 2 and its associated equipment. This would be determined by
the rate of success in drilling that had been achieved to date.

Method and Assumptions Made to Determine the Rate of Return on Investment
1.        The rate of return on the investment is defined as the discount
rate at which the present values of all project-related capital and operating
costs, on one side, and the revenues attributable to the project, on the other,
over the life of the project, are equal.
2.        The capital costs of Olkaria (exclusive of costs incurred prior
to 1978) are estimated at August 1979 constant prices. The economic life
of Olkaria was assumed to be 25 years.
3.        Shadow prices were applied to foreign cost at a rate assumed to
be 40% above the official exchange rate. Local unskilled labor was not
shadow priced because the small percentage work involved would not affect
the result of the calculation to any significant extent. The operating
costs include the cost of drilling two new wells every three years.
4.        The streams of costs and revenues are presented in the table on
page two of this annex. The rate of return on investment is 13% based on 1979
tariffs.
5.        The rate of return on investment is sensitive to changes in costs
and revenues. A 10% increase in total costs together with a 10% decrease in
benefits would reduce the rate of return to 10%.

KENYA
OLKARIA GEOTHERMAL POWER PROJECT
KENYA POWER COMPANY, LIMITED
History of the Power Companies
1.        The Kenya Electric Supply Industry is presently comprised of
three companies:
(a) The East African Power & Lighting Company, Limited (EAP&L);
(b) The Kenya Power Company, Limited (KPC); and
(c) Tana River Development Company, Limited (TRDC).
2.        A fourth is the Tana River Development Association (TRDA) which
will begin producing energy in 1981.
The East African Power & Lighting Company, Limited
3.        EAP&L, which is the sole distribution company, was incorporated
in 1922 by the amalgamation of two undertakings which had supplied Nairobi
and Mombasa since 1907 and 1909, respectively. It is a local private
company with authorized share capital of K1 10,000,000, of which KE 9,741,504
is issued. In addition, loan capital amounting to Kf 5.72 million was
outstanding as at the end of 1978. Although formerly operating throughout
Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, its activities have been confined to Kenya
since 1964 due to purchase of the Uganda and Tanzania undertakings by the
respective Governments. The company is primarily concerned with the
commercial distribution of electricity throughout Kenya. At present it
also generates the entire power requirements of the coast system covering
Mombasa, Malindi and Kwale, provides the necessary thermal back-up for the
main grid system, and operates generating stations in centers not connected
to the grid. It also coordinates all sources of power, and staffs and
manages the other two companies (KPC and TRDC) and, beginning in 1981, will
be responsible for the Upper Reservoir generating station.
4.        In 1970 the Government acquired a controlling interest in EAP&L
when it made a successful bid for all the shares on the London Register.
Since then the Government has been purchasing shares as they come in the
East African market, and its total holding together with that of government-
controlled agencies is now probably in the neighborhood of 60%.
The Kenya Power Company, Limited (KPC)
5.        In 1955 EAP&L was faced with the problem of financing the con-
struction of a 132-kV transmission line to interconnect the power systems
of Uganda and Kenya as well as other expansion requirements. The company
did not consider it practicable to raise the required finances through new
equity issues because of conservative dividend policies due to political
pressures and the need for increased self-financing. There was also revived



- 49 -
ANNEX 5.1
Page 2 of 2
political pressure for nationalization. The company concluded it was
inevitable and desirable to increase public ownership and direct government
participation in the power industry. Accordingly, it was decided to form a
new company, KPC, in 1955 with an issued nominal capital of KE 100 held
equally by EAP&L, the Government and Power Securities Corporation, Limited
(PSC). 1/ KPC's function was to construct the transmission line and to
take over the ownership of the two hydroelectric stations belonging to
EAP&L on the Tana River. KPC financed its requirements through issuance of
L Stg. 7.5 million of debenture stock, the payment of the debt service on
which was guaranteed by EAP&L's undertaking to purchase KPC's entire
production at "ascertained cost".
6.        In accordance with its policy of increasing its participation in
the electricity supply industry, the Government acquired 100% of KPC's
issued share capital by buying out EAP&L's and Power Securities Corporation,
Limited in 1971.
Tana River Development Company, Limited (TRDC)
7.        A forecast of load growth after Kenya's achievement of independence
in December 1963 indicated that it would be necessary to commission further
major generating capacity by 1967-68, and a reappraisal of the Seven Forks
Scheme (the harnessing of the hydro potential of the Upper Tana) established
Kindaruma as the most economical first stage development. TRDC was formed
in 1964 to finance the Kindaruma hydroelectric development for much the
same reasons as led to the formation of KPC. The share capital of TRDC is
a nominal KE 100 which was held equally by EAP&L, the Government, Power
Securities Corporation, and Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC)
until February 1971, when the Kenya Government acquired the entire stock.
CDC supplied L Stg. 3.5 million of a total of about L Stg. 6 million of
loan capital which was arranged for the Kindaruma project. Kamburu
Stage 1, comprising the first two generating units, was comissioned in
July 1974 and the third unit in 1976. Gitaru, the last of the Seven Forks
hydroelectric projects, was commissioned in 1978. Like KPC, TRDC sells its
entire output to EAP&L at ascertained cost.
Tana River Development Association
8.        A fourth company, Tana River Development Association, is presently
building the Upper Reservoir on the Tana River primarily for irrigation
purposes. Advantage of the dam has been taken by EAP&L to complete arrange-
ments with TRDA to include a powerhouse and related structures and equipment
at the site. EAP&L will pay a fixed charge of KE 1.8 million per year to
TRDA from the date the reservoir is first filled to the maximum operating
level. This charge will be adjusted in relation to the cost of fuel that
this powerhouse displaces at the time of commissioning. All costs in
excess of KE 245,000 for operation and maintenance of the powerhouse and
other direct power-producing facilities, not including the dam, will be
paid by TRDA.
1/   PSC is a UK finance house which arranged the financing of most of
EAP&L's development in the past. It is also the parent company of
EAP&L's engineering consultants.

Project Monitoring System
There are several key factors which affect the operation of a
utility and the ultimate success of the project. These have been discussed
with the Borrower, and it was determined that existing systems for gathering
information and statistics are acceptable, and there is no need to add new
requirements for additional monitoring purposes.
The project, however, would be monitored, and the main items to
be monitored are described below:
1.   Critical Items for Project Implementation
(a) Progress of construction relative to the schedule;
(b) Rate of drilling new wells and associated steam
characteristics;
(c) Production capability of wells so as to determine when the
option on the second unit could be exercised;
(d) On-line date of Unit 1; and
(e) On-line date of Unit 2.
2.   Staff Training
Training activities will be checked against targets which have been
agreed upon.
3.   Financial
(a) Review of financial status of the combined companies before
April 30, 1980; and
(b) Comparison of appraisal financial forecast and actual
performance.

Notes and Assumptions for Financial Statements
Sales and Revenues
1.        EAP&L energy sales and revenue projections for each customer
category appear in Annex 6.5. Revenues from 1979 onwards are based on a 10%
tariff increase effective July 1, 1980 and further annual average tariff
increases of 20%, 9%, 11% and 13% effective January 1, 1981 to 1984
respectively.
2.        A consumption tax of 1,/kWh is levied on all energy sales.
3.        The revenues of KPC and TRDC are their respective ascertained
costs, the amount payable by EAP&L for electricity purchased from both
companies as described in para. 4. The ascertained costs of both companies
include a development surcharge as described in para. 5 below.
Ascertained Cost
4.        The bulk supply licenses of KPC and TRDC define ascertained cost
(on the basis of which their revenues are determined) as the actual audited
cost each year for the following items:
(a) Operations and administration. For KPC this also includes the
cost of purchasing power from Uganda;
(b) Interest and redemption payments for debt;
(c) Income or other taxes. TRDC's income is exempt from payment of
income tax and KPC has had no taxable income because of large
depreciation allowance deductible for tax purposes; and
(d) Such other charges as the Government shall consider proper to
be allowed. Under this authority a development surcharge
(described later in this annex) has been added up to 1978 as a
part of ascertained cost of TRDC and is proposed for KPC from
1980.
In addition, ascertained cost includes small annual appropriations to a
Reserve and Equalization Fund which, with the interest on the securities
in which it is invested, is available for future capital expenditure or to
cover deficiencies in income and to pay for abnormal expenses.

Development Surcharge
5.        Development surcharge, being paid by EAP&L to TRDC, was prin-
cipally designed to provide the latter with a part of the funds required to
pay the local currency costs of its Kamburu project (IBRD Loan 745-KE) and
Gitaru project (IBRD Loan 1147-KE).  The surcharge has been paid by EAP&L,
since 1971, as part of the cost of electricity it purchases from TRDC and
has been determined each year so that the rate of return on average net
fixed assets in service of TRDC and KPC combined was similar to that earned
by EAP&L. The payment of surcharge has provided to TRDC funds for part of
the local currency requirements of the Gitaru project. The surcharge
payment was intended to result each year in similar rates of return for
TRDC/KPC combined and EAP&L, measured in terms of net operating income as a
percentage of average net fixed assets in service for the years 1971-1974,
and average net fixed assets including work in progress for the years
1975-1978. The latter method provided larger amounts to TRDC during the
construction period when the requirements of funds for t'he project were
substantial. This also reduced the income tax burden of the power sector
during the construction period of the project by increasing TRDC's income
which is exempt from income tax and by reducing EAP&L's taxable income.
Development surcharge payment by EAP&L to KPC has been provided from 1980
to 1982 to help provide local currency requirements of the geothermal
project (para. 6.09).
Fuel Cost and Purchased Energy
6.        The fuel cost per GWh of operating EAP&L's plants is assumed to
increase 10% per year.
7.        KPC's annual purchases from UEB are assumed to be constant at 254
GWh and KE 390,000 from 1979 onward under the existing long-term contract
(to 2005).  TRDC is assumed to purchase 192 GWh from TRDA's Upper Reservoir
in 1982 and 217 GWh annually thereafter. The estimated cost of this energy
is based on the agreement for electricity purchase by EAP&L from TRDA.
Operating and Administration Expenses
8.        Increases in volume of operations are reflected in these expenses,
4% for EAP&L; for KPC, due to the addition of two geothermal units in 1981
and 1983 respectively, the expenses are expected to increase by KE 60,000
for each unit. The sharp increase in TRDC's 1979 operating and administration
costs reflects the first full year of operation of Gitaru as well as major
non-recurring maintenance. In addition, provision for price escalation of 10%
per year has been made.
Depreciation
9.        Depreciation is charged as a percentage of the revalued fixed
asset value at the beginning of each year: EAP&L 3.7%, KPC 2.7%, TRDC 2.2%.
This is consistent with past experience. The depreciatiorl for the years
1975 to 1977 is computed on cost of fixed assets; whereas for the period
after 1977, it has been calculated on the revalued fixed assets.



-  59   -              ANNEX 6.7
Page 3 of 5
Taxes
10.       TRDC's income is exempt from income tax.  Incomes of KPC and
EAP&L are subject to tax; the present rate of tax is 45%. KPC has not paid
income taxes in the past because it has accumulated losses for tax purposes
arising from higher depreciation allowance deductible for tax computation
than the accounting depreciation.
Dividends
11.       Dividends on 4% and 7% preferred stock are KE 97,000 per year.
Dividends on common stock of EAP&L are assumed to continue at the 1978
level of 12% per year.
Rate of Return - Financial
12.       The rate of return for the years 1975 to 1979 has been calculated
on the average revalued net fixed assets including work in progress, in
accordance with the requirements of IBRD Loan 1147-KE. The depreciation
allowance used in calculating operating income for those years is on the
basis of the cost of fixed assets, in keeping with past practice. The rate
of return for years starting from 1980 has been calculated on the average
revalued net fixed assets in operation, in accordance with the method
suggested for the proposed loan. Depreciation allowance used for calcula-
tion of operating income from 1980 onwards is on the basis of the revalued
fixed assets.
Rate of Return - Statutory
13.       Under the Electric Power Act of Kenya (Section 47), a power
company's tariffs would be subject to reduction to the extent of five-sixths
of the amount by which operating income before income tax for any year
exceeds 12-1/2% of the "capital expended on the undertaking" as of the end
of the year. This statutory assets base is shown as the total of fixed
assets at cost, including work in progress and inventories at the end of
each year.
Fixed Assets
14.       Fixed assets and depreciation for the years 1975 to 1978 are at
cost as shown in audited accounts; however, these have been increased in
1979 to reflect their estimated replacement values and in 1980 and subsequent
years by 10% and 6.5%, respectively, to reflect estimated price escalations in
those years.
Accounts Receivable
15.       EAP&L's accounts receivable are assumed to be 15% of total
revenues in accordance with recent past experience.



_  60  -              ANNEX 6.7
Page 4 of 5
Inventories
16.       Considering past experience, EAP&L's inventories are assumed to be
6% of gross revalued plant in operation while those of KPC and TRDC are
assumed to be constant.
Long-Term Debt
17.       A statement showing the composition of foreign exchange and local
currency loans of KPC appears on the following page.

Electricity Tariff Structure
1.        EAP&L's new tariff structure was developed in consultation with
the Bank. It took effect on January 1, 1979 and comprises the following
six categories:
Method A:  covers consumers whose monthly usage does not
exceed 7,000 kWh.
Method B:  is applicable to consumers with monthly usage ranging
from 7,001 to 100,000 kWh.
Method C:  covers consumers whose monthly usage exceeds 100,000
units.
Method D:  Off-peak supplies.
Method E:  Public Lighting.
Method F:  Company staff.
2.        In addition, there is provision for the introduction of a fuel
oil cost adjustment with the approval of the Ministry of Power and Communi-
cations. This is a surcharge designed to allow EAP&L to recover part of
any additional fuel costs from electricity consumers based on the difference
between actual fuel cost and a "basic price".
3.        Details of the tariffs are presented in the attached table.

Loan Capital and Security Arrangements of EAP&L, KPC and TRDC
1.        This annex describes the loan capital of power companies of
Kenya and the arrangements securing this loan capital. The amounts stated
represent the total amount of the loans contracted and not the amounts
outstanding, which are given in Annex 6.7. Unless indicated otherwise,
all references to t are references to E Sterling.
EAP&L
2.        EAP&L's loan capital comprises loans from Commonwealth Development
Corporation (CDC) (L 350,000, E 2,944,000 and E 1,500,000), and from Glyn,
Mills and Company syndicate (L 2,887,520, E 216,400, E 2,724,320 and
_ 240,000). The CDC loan of E 350,000 was secured by (i) EAP&L's 8-1/2%
Debentures 1971-85; and (ii) a Trust Deed dated November 1, 1968, which
provided for a first legal charge on specified leasehold properties of
EAP&L. The E 2,944,000 CDC loan and the E 2,887,520 loan from the Glyn,
Mills and Company syndicate were respectively secured by Debenture Stock
1975-91 and 1971-80 respectively, as well as a Trust Deed dated May 16,
1969. This Trust Deed created mortgages and charges on certain of EAP&L's
properties and assets and also stipulated that EAP&L was not to create any
mortgage or charge ranking in priority to or pari passu with that mortgage
or charge. The E 1,500,000 CDC loan and Glyn syndicate loans of E 2,724,320
and E 240,000 were secured by Debenture Stock 1979-88, and 1978-80 respec-
tively, as well as a supplemental Trust Deed dated August 29, 1974 which
made these loans to rank pari passu with the loans secured by the Trust
Deed dated May 16, 1969. By the end of 1978 EAP&L had also taken up KE 64,800
at 8% on an unsecured basis from a KE 750,000 given by the British Government
to the Government of Kenya and a further KE 362,100 on similar terms from a
loan of KE 1 million made to the Government of Kenya by the Finnish Government.
KPC
3.        In 1955 KPC floated a E 7,500,000 loan by the issue of a E 7,500,000
5-1/2% Debenture Stock 1975/85. E 3,500,000 of this loan was subscribed by
CDC, and the balance was underwritten for public sale. The Debenture Stock
was secured by a Trust Deed dated June 27, 1956, which among other things,
created a first legal charge and a floating charge in respect of KPC's
property and assets and stipulated that KPC was not to create any further
charges or incumbrances upon its undertakings and assets ranking in priority
to or pari passu with the charges created under the Trust Deed except in
special stated circumstances. The Trust Deed also provided that any scheme
for the reconstruction should require an extraordinary resolution of the
stockholders which means in effect the consent of three-fourths of the



-  65  -                ANNEX 6.9
Page 2 of 2
stockholders. KPC also took up in 1977 an unsecured 9% loan from EAP&L,
in the amount of KE 1,316,879, repayable in 10 years commencing from the
commissioning of the first geothermal plant as well as KE 62,390 of an 8.5%
unsecured loan from TRDC totalling KE 145,000 (balance taken up in 1978)
and repayable from 1979 to the year 2000. Both of these loans were repaid in
1978.
TRDC
4.        TRDC's loan capital in 1978 came from CDC, the Glyn, Mills and
Company syndicate (now Williams & Glyn's Bank Ltd.), EAP&L, IBRD, the
Government of Kenya, from a SIDA credit to the Government of Kenya, and
from the Standard Bank Limited and export suppliers credits. A Trust Deed
dated May 26, 1966 modified and extended by three Supplemental Trust Deeds
dated December 5, 1968, December 16, 1971 and March 10, 1976, secures the
following loans: (i) E 3,742,911 A Debenture Stock 1971-87, (ii) Shs
9,240,500 and Shs. 5,380,000 B Debenture Stock 1971-87, (iii) Shs. 6,040,000
C Debenture Stock 1971-87, (iv) Shs. 81,300,000 E Debenture Stock 1975-96,
(v) US$23,000,000 and US$63,000,000 IBRD loans (vi) E 2,000,000 Debenture
Stock 1980-91 (vii) KE 2,000,000 loan from EAP&L (viii) KE 1,890,000 loan
from the Government of Kenya. The Trust Deed provided for the creation
of a floating charge of TRDC's undertakings, property and assets and also
required TRDC (i) not to (A) create without the Trustee's consent any
mortage or charge ranking in priority to or pari passu with the floating
charge of (B) create any specific mortgage or charge over any of its
immovable property or other assets without prior written consent of the
Trustee or have any subsidiary, except with the prior written consent of
the Trustee. The Trust Deed also provides for the creation and issue in
specified circumstances of additional stock to rank pari passu in point
of security with the original stock created under the Trust Deed. These
circumstances include the need to secure any loan TRDC would need to finance
later stages of the Seven Forks Hydroelectric Project.
5.        In addition, TRDC has issued promissory notes in the amounts of
DM 22,553,000 and US$217,000 to cover part of the export suppliers credits
while DM 32,459,000 financed by Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau is covered
by a guarantee from the West German Government. The loan from the Standard
Bank Limited was unsecured and repaid in 1978.
