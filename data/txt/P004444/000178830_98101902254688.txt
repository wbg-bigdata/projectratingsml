REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES FOR A
THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a loan for the
equivalent of US$25 million, to the Republic of the Philippines to help
finance the foreign exchange cost of an education project. The loan would be
on standard Third Window terms of 25 years, including seven years of grace,
with interest at 4-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        The most recent Economic Report - "Current Economic Position
and Prospects of the Philippines" (No. 568-PH of November 7. 1974) was
circulated to the Executive Directors on November 11, 1974. A basic
economic mission visited the Philippines in April/May 1975 and is now
finalizing its report. The discussion below includes the findings of the
mission. Annex I of this report contains country economic data.
3.        During the 1960s, the economy grew in real terms at the rate of
5-6 percent per annum. However, the rate of growth was less than the level
that might have been achieved if the considerable natural and human resources
of the Philippines had been exploited more effectively. Moreover, the bene-
fits of growth were not distributed widely and unemployment rose. Low levels
of taxation resulted in inadequate public investment in necessary infrastruc-
ture and social services. Relatively weak export performance, combined with
a failure to reduce the import dependence of domestic industry, resulted
in a steady deterioration in the balance of payments position.
4.        During 1970-72, the authorities adopted policies of monetary and
fiscal restraint in order to lay a firm basis for future growth. With
assistance from the Consultative Group, they succeeded in improving substan-
tially the maturity strujcture of the external public debt. Real GNP during
that period increased at about 5 percent a year. In 1972, following severe
floods, the President began a series of social and economic reforms in the
country including an agTarian reform program, tax reforms, and an adminis-
trative reorganization. These programs are beginning to show results.
5.        In 1973 there was a sharp increase in the level of economic acti-
vity in the Philippines. This upsurge was led by the international commodity
boom, which resulted in higher export incomes in the Philippines, a strong
recovery in agriculturaL and industrial production for the domestic market
and an expansion in pubLic and private investment. The growth in real GNP
doubled to 10 percent.
1/   The paragraphs in ]?art I (with the exception of paragraph 20) and
II of this report are the same as those in the Second Livestock De-
velopment Project Report.

of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be discd   without World Bank authorization.



- 2 -
6.        Like most countries, the Philippines was profoundly affected by
the tumultuous events in the world economy that began with the jump in the
prices for food and petroleum in late 1973. With international trade the
equivalent of almost half of its GNP, the Philippines proved quite vulner-
able to the impact of world inflation, the increase in oil prices and the
prolonged recession in the industrialized countries. This sequence of
events has temporarily frustrated the Government's attempt to accelerate
the rate of development, and in 1974 GNP increased by only about 6 percent
in real terms. While adverse effects of the recession were cushioned some-
what in 1974 by a modest improvement in the external terms of trade, the
Philippines has been even more seriously affected in 1975 by the continued
rise in import prices and reduced demand for Philippine exports. The real
growth of GNP in 1975 is estimated to have been at about the 6 percent rate
of the previous year. Improvement in the growth performance in 1976 can be
expected only if recovery takes place in the economies of the Philippines'
main trading partners.
7.        Agricultural production has grown at an average rate of 3.2
percent per year during the 1970s, a period which has been affected by un-
usually adverse weather conditions. Rice production increased by 25 percent
in 1973-74, but due to serious damage by typhoons, it grew by only 1 percent
in 1974-75, and the Government had to import 200,000 tons in the first half
of 1975 to ensure adequate stocks. However, initial indications are that
the outlook for rice production in 1975-76 is bright. The Government is
giving the highest priority to increasing agricultural production and has
initiated a number of programs designed to expand the use of fertilizer,
irrigation and supervised credit. It has also intensified efforts to expand
social services needed in rural areas, including rural electrification,
health and family planning services as well as small-scale road and irri-
gation projects.
8.        Although progress has been slower than initially planned, the
Government has moved ahead with its agrarian reform program for the nation's
one million tenant farmers who grow rice and corn. By mid-1975, land trans-
fer certificates had been issued to nearly 200,000 tenants and progress had
been made on land valuations and the transfer of titles. The Government has
raised the cash portion of the compensation package to landlords to reduce
their resistance to land reform, but strong administrative efforts will be
necessary to ensure continued progress in the implementation of the program.
9.        Industry accounts for almost 30 percent of net domestic product,
one-third of total fixed investment and 15 percent of total employment.
Industrial production, which grew by 12 percent in 1973, was adversely af-
fected in 1974 by the world-wide economic slowdown and grew by only 3.6
percent in 1975. This decline is primarily a result of depressed demand
for Philippine exports on the part of the country's main trading partners
and the concomitant slowdown in the rate of economic growth in the Philip-
pines. Nonetheless, the long-term prospects for industrial growth are
favorable because of the natural and human resource endowment of the
Philippines and a very active private sector.



- 3 -
10.       The Government: has made significant progress in increasing public
investment. The ratio of public investment to GNP is currently about 3 per-
cent compared with 1.8 percent in FY72. The Government has also imple-
mented a series of long needed tax reforms and improvements in tax adminis-
tration. These reforms, aided by the increased economic activity, the boom
in export incomes, and domestic inflation, resulted in a 36 percent increase
in national government t:ax revenues in FY73, and an estimated 47 percent in
FY74. As a result, the ratio of national government tax revenues to GNP
has increased from an average of 9 percent in recent years to an estimated
12.3 percent in FY74.
11.       In the latter part of 1973, inflation emerged as a major problem
in the Philippines and in 1974 consumer prices rose by almost 40 percent.
The rise was caused by the large increase in liquidity that came with the
export boom in 1973-74, and by a number of cost-push factors, including the
higher rate of world inflation. To deal with this problem, the Government
adopted contractionary monetary and fiscal policies, and attempted to
reduce the impact of inf'lation on consumers by subsidizing such essential
goods as wheat, imported rice, and cooking oil. As a consequence of the
Government's measures, the annual rate of inflation decreased to less than
20 percent at the end of 1974 and less than 10 percent in 1975.
12.       The rapid inflation in 1974 exacerbated the decline in real wages
which had begun in 1970. Overall, there was a decline of about 20 percent
in real wages during 19/4. In order to offset the deterioration of real
wages in urban areas, the Government increased the salaries of Government
employees and directed private firms to grant emergency cost of living ad-
justments to employees earning less than P 600 per month. Nevertheless
real urban wage incomes declined and reduced the demand for manufactured
products, which contributed to the poor performance of the manufacturing
sector in 1974. The depression in the urban areas was partly offset by the
improvement in rural incomes that stemmed from continued high prices for
agricultural commodities.
13.       On the external side, the Philippine balance of payments bene-
fitted considerably from the international commodity price boom during 1973.
High prices for the country's chief exports, including coconut products,
sugar, copper and wood products resulted in a 70 percent boost in export
earnings and a balance of payments surplus of about $670 million. Since
mid-1974 the external trade position has deteriorated, due to the sharp
increases in the prices of-oil and other imports, less favorable prices
for Philippine exports, and reduced volume of some exports resulting from
the recession in the economies of the Philipines' main trading partners. As
a result, the overall balance of payments surplus fell to about $100 million
in 1974, and a deficit of about $400 million was recorded in 1975. Inter-
national reserves stood at about $1.1 billion at the end of 1975, the equiv-
alent of three months imports.
14.       The outlook for 1976 is for exports to increase by about 12 per-
cent in real terms on the assumption that there will be some international
economic recovery. Imports will need to grow by about 7 percent in real terms



- 4 -
in order to maintain the growth of the economy. Due to a modest deteriora-
tion of the terms of trade, the current account deficit may reach about
$1 billion compared to $860 million in 1974.    Medium and long term capital
inflows are expected to finance most of this deficit, producing an overall
balance of payments deficit of about $200 million. Such a deficit can be
managed without serious pressure on reserves through utilization of the IMF
oil facility and by short-term foreign borrowing by the Central Bank.
15.       The overall level of debt of the Philippines is expected to remain
within reasonable limits, as the ratio of debt service payments to exports
and non-factor services would average about 16-17 percent during the rest of
this decade. At present, the Bank/IDA share in total debt outstanding is
about 10 percent and its share in debt-service is about 4 percent. These
shares are expected to increase somewhat in the years ahead.
16.       Foreign assistance is expected to continue to be of major import-
ance in helping to finance the larger investment expenditures which will be
necessary for the country's development. In order to ensure that disbursement
of external assistance reaches levels commensurate with the level of develop-
ment expenditures which will be required during the latter part of the decade,
total commitments will need to be maintained in real terms at least at the
level of about $500 million which was achieved in 1974. The Consultative
Group for the Philippines at its meeting in Paris on October 1, 1975, agreed
that it would be reasonable for the Philippine Government to seek aid commit-
ments of about $600 million during 1976.
Growth Prospects
17.       Despite the slowdown in the growth of the economy which is primarily
a result of worldwide economic conditions, the Government remains committed
to regaining the growth momentum which began in 1973 to provide for a con-
tinued increase in incomes and employment. High priority must be accorded
to expanding employment opportunities - in the short-term as well as the
long-term - because unemployment and underemployment are still high and the
labor force continues to grow at 3 percent a year.
18.       Priority must also be given to expanding food production for the
domestic market, to expanding industrial export production and to accelerating
development of local energy resources. The difficulties experienced during
the last two years in importing sufficient quantities of food at reasonable
prices, especially cereals, have increased the Government's resolve to
achieve self-sufficiency in rice and corn as soon as possible. The Govern-
ment rightly recognizes that the increased cost of petroleum and other
imports cannot be financed indefinitely by borrowing abroad and it is active-
ly encouraging both local and foreign investors to expand the productive
capacity of export industries and to undertake major new import-replacing
investments. Because it will take time for these investments to have an
impact on the balance of payments, the Government is seeking increased
support from the international financial community to help carry out its
development program and to ease the adjustment to higher petroleum and other
import prices. Because of the substantial easing of the external debt burden



- 5 -
which has taken place in the last several years, the Philippines now has the
capacity to borrow externally larger amounts of capital in support of its
development program.
19.       Given the likely availability of resources and the expected growth
in various sectors, it is reasonable for the Government to plan for a longer
term growth in GNP of about 7 percent a year in real terms. To achieve
this objective, increased investments will be needed in a wide range of in-
dustries. Public investments also need to be increased. A new public in-
frastructure program is being prepared, and the Government is putting
emphasis on developing nuclear and indigenous power sources and on irrigation,
feeder roads and other projects to support increased food production. The
Government has made considerable progress in recent years in building up the
capacity of public sector agencies to prepare and execute projects. However,
there will be a need for continued efforts to strengthen this aspect of
administration. The ratio of public investment to GNP will need to rise
from the present level of 3 percent to about 5 percent by 1980. To support
the level of investment, the Government will need to intensify its tax
efforts so that the ratio of national taxes to GNP rises from its present
level of 11-12 percent to 14 percent by 1980.
20.       The Government's ambitious development program will continue to
require foreign resources in addition to the capital which would become
available for the financing of the foreign exchange component of development
projects. Some financing of local costs is justified, especially for pro-
jects of economic and social importance which need limited amounts of for-
eign exchange. In view of the Philippines balance of payments and exter-
nal debt position, and caking into account the country's performance in
economic development and its relatively low per capita income, the Philip-
pines is also considered eligible for Third Window loans from the Bank.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES
21.       The Philippines has received 32 Bank loans and three IDA credits
totalling $791.2 million, net of cancellations. About 36 percent of the
Bank/IDA lending, $293 niillion, has been for infrastructure projects in
power, transportation, End water supply and $38 million has been for popu-
lation and education. Of the remainder about $216 million has been for
agriculture and about $250 million for industry. There has been a marked
improvement in the way Eank financed projects in the Philippines have been
executed in the last three years compared with experience in the 1960s
when shortages of peso counterpart funds combined with poor administration
to cause serious problens. All these projects are now going reasonably well.
Annex II contains a sumnary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC
investments as of January 31, 1976 and notes on the execution of on-going
projects.
22.       The Bank's lending program has been designed to continue to sup-
port the Philippine development effort with its particular emphasis on
agriculture and infrastructure. Shortages of domestic revenues led to low



- 6 -
investment for these purposes in the past. The last three years have seen
major changes which have helped to overcome these constraints and both the
ambitious Philippine development program and the Bank's lending program have
been designed to make good past neglect and to meet future needs. Commit-
ments in FY74 amounted to $165.1 million, and in FY75 $208 million compared
to an average of about $30 million a year in the preceding five years.
23.       Two loans, one of $42 million for the Magat River Multipurpose
project and one of $75 million for the Industrial Investment Credit Project
have already been approved by the Executive Directors in FY76. In addition
to this project and the proposed Second Livestock Project, other projects
for fisheries, grain storage, urban development and irrigation may be ready
for consideration in FY76.
24.       IFC has made commitments in the Philippines totalling $76.2
million for investments in 13 companies in the fields of development bank-
ing, power, telecommunications, ceramic tiles, paper, petroleum products,
nickel mining and refining, chemicals and synthetic fibers. Of these
investments, as of January 31, 1976, $18.9 million had been sold, $0.4
million cancelled and $3.4 million repaid, leaving a net portfolio of
$53.5 million. On the same date all commitments were fully disbursed.
Preliminary proposals have been received for an aluminum smelter and
other projects in the pulp and paper, dinnerware, metal alloys and ship-
building fields.
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
25.       The quantitative achievements of the Philippines education system
are impressive: the literacy rate (estimated at 87 percent) is among the
highest in Asia and enrollment at the elementary level is universal. The
enrollment ratios of 46 percent at the secondary level and 24 percent at
higher levels are among the highest in the world. Most elementary school
pupils are enrolled in public schools, but about 52 percent of secondary
school students and over 90 percent of those in higher education are en-
rolled in private institutions. However, the quality of education is low be-
cause of outdated curricula, a serious lack of textbooks and other teaching
aids and the lack of proper data for decision-making and policy formulation.
26.       Education Structure and Administration.   The Philippines' educa-
tional system is comprised of a six-year elementary level, a four-year
secondary level, and a four-year tertiary level, followed by further post-
graduate programs. Thus, the combined elementary-secondary program provides
for ten years of education.
27.       The formulation of educational policy lies with the National Board
of Education, which is chaired by the Secretary of Education and Culture.
Administrative responsibility for public schools and non-chartered colleges,
as well as supervision of private schools, rests with the Department of
Education and Culture (DEC). The DEC was reorganized in July 1975 with the



establishment of three integrated bureaus organized by level of education
(elementary, secondary, and higher education) to replace each of three exist-
ing bureaus organized by type of schools (public, vocational, and private).
The three parallel orglanizations have been consolidated into a single organi-
zation and each of the Department's twelve regional offices now deals with all
levels of education. The consolidation of the field organizations is a dis-
tinct improvement Aove7- the past arrangements. The establishment of regional
bureaus, accompanied by a decentralization of authority as planned, should
speed up decision maki ng on local matters.
28.       Elementary Education. Enrollment at the elementary level is uni-
versal but there is much repetition and attrition. The teaching force is
generally well trained. About three-quarters of 230,000 public elementary
school teachers are four-year college graduates. Most of the others are
graduates from two-year normal colleges or from agricultural, arts, and
trades colleges. The pupil/teacher ratio is low (31:1 in public elementary
schools). A serious problem is the lack of textbooks. There are few books,
and most of those available are used in the urban schools.
29.       Secondary EaLucation. About 46 percent of the secondary school age
group attend school (almost equally divided between men and women). Pupil/
teacher ratios are reasonable (34:1 in private schools and 38:1 in public
schools) and teachers are well-qualified (about 95 percent are college
graduates in education). However, as in primary schools, instructional
materials, particularly textbooks, are in short supply and inadequate in
content.
30.       Higher Education. The student participation rate at higher levels
is 24 percent (with women's participation being higher than men's). Most
students (93 percent) attend private institutions; about 40 percent of the
students are in Manila but substantial educational opportunities are available
in other regions as well. The quality of higher education varies. Increased
investments have improved the quality of graduates from selected institutions,
but graduates from many institutions are poorly trained. Facilities, equip-
ment and instructional materials are good in a few select institutions, but in
general they are scarce or non-existent. In the best institutions, 50 percent
of the staff hold post-graduate degrees, but in most other institutions
few staff have received post-graduate training.
31.       There are eight dominant local languages spoken in the Philippines
by about 86 percent of the people, and some 80 dialects spoken by the others.
The language closest to a national language is Pilipino (Tagalog) which is
understood by about 60 percent of the people in the country. English is
the most important non-local language, known by about half the population
and is the chief language of government, business and industry, mass media
and universities.
32.       In June 1974, the Government announced a new bilingual policy
which made English the medium of instruction for all science and mathematics
courses and Pilipino for all other subjects. Before that date, the local
vernacular served as the medium of instruction for the first two grades



- 8 -
and English in the higher grades. The implementation of the new language
policy is to be phased over an eight-year period and to be completed by
1982.
33.       The main objective of the new language policy is to develop a
unifying national language (Pilipino) while maintaining the widely-spoken
non-national language (English) for subjects such as mathematics and sciences
The policy seems to be a workable compromise. However, its implementation
will pose difficulties for those sections of the population that speak little
Pilipino at present. For those people, it will be necessary to accompany
introduction of the bilingual education policy with intensive language train-
ing in Pilipino.
34.       Textbooks.   The Textbook Board, within the administrative frame-
work of the DEC, has been responsible for approving textbook manuscripts.
Textbooks are often written by private publishers and individual teachers;
they are also contracted out by DEC. The Textbook Production Service of the
DEC contracts with private firms for the printing of books and with private
freight forwarders for book distribution. Payment for books ordered by the
central government is made by the DEC and for books ordered locally by the
local government. The present policy of the Government is not to charge
public school students for books.
35.       The process of producing and distributing books has not been
satisfactory. The development of a new textbook title takes about six years
and the supply of books has been irregular and insufficient. It is esti-
mated that in the public elementary and secondary schools there is an
average of only one book for every ten pupils in any one subject. Another
50 million textbooks would be needed throughout the public school system
to provide each pupil with one textbook per subject. Moreover, 80 percent
of the existing books are at least five years old, in poor condition, and
outdated. The books lack continuity in subject matter from grade to grade,
are inconsistent in the level of language proficiency demanded of pupils and
provide no reinforcement in content between related subject areas. The main
reasons for lack of textbooks have been the absence of an effective institu-
tion to develop and supply textbooks to schools regularly.
36.       Electronic Media.   Radio broadcasts are used in elementary and
adult education, in-service teacher training and agricultural extension.
Despite the variety of educational radio and television activities, they
appear to have had only a marginal impact due to their unsystematic use.
Given the potential for widespread quality improvement through mass media,
particularly in rural areas, the Government plans to undertake a study of
the possible role of electronic media and other educational technology in
Philippine education.
36.       Educational Financing.   The total amount of funds (public and
private) allocated to education in 1975 is estimated at P 3,000 million
(US$402 million and about 3.2 percent of GNP); two-thirds is provided by the
national government. Although national government expenditures devoted to
education more than doubled between 1968 and 1974, they decreased as a share



- 9 -
of total national Government expenditures from 32 to 15 percent. Most (85
percent) of the national government expenditure on education is devoted to
elementary schools, whkich are the responsibility of the national government.
Public secondary schools are supported by local government finance which
varies according to the income of the region. One consequence of this is
a substantial variation in the quality of instruction according to the income
of the locality. Another characteristic of educational financing is that 90
percent of public operating expenditures on education consists of salaries
and other personnel costs. Hardly any provision was made in the past for
textbooks and other supplies and a Special Education Fund was therefore
created in 1973. Functs available for textbooks and other teaching materials
from this source amounted to P 21.5 million (US$2.9 million) in 1975, but
are still far from adequate.
38.       Development Priorities and Education Reform.    During the 1960s,
Government policies emphasized improvements in the training of middle and
higher levels of agricultural, industrial and scientific manpower. A
national education development strategy for the period 1973 to 1982 was
developed by a 1970 Presidential survey of the education sector. In
accordance with this strategy priority is being given to the improvement of
educational quality, the strengthening of educational administration, the
redress of imbalances of educational opportunities between rural and urban
areas and greater Government control over higher level schooling. Improved
educational quality is to be achieved by updating curricula, integrating
academic and vocational studies at the secondary level and producing textbooks
based on the updated and revised curricula. The Government is also to in-
vestigate ways in which it could use satellite communication and other mass
media to improve the quality of education. Educational administration is to
be strengthened through the reorganization of the DEC, better planning, and
the provision of a regular flow of up-to-date information to managers. The
imbalance of educational opportunities between the rural and urban areas is to
be redressed through construction of new secondary schools in rural areas.
Increased Government control of higher level schooling is to be achieved
by introducing a program of certification and by increasing the Government's
financial support of higher level schools.
39.       Presidential Decree No. 6-A (of 1972) established the machinery
to implement the new development strategy. It authorized the appropria-
tion of P 50 million (US$6.7 million) per annum for a period of 10 years
for development projects. It established a Special Education Committee
(comprised of the Secretary of Education and Culture, the Secretary of
Finance, and the Commissioner of the Budget) to administer the appropriated
funds and the Education Development Projects Implementing Task Force (EDPITAF)
to implement projects.   The Government has succeeded in establishing EDPITAF
as a strong agency capable of implementing the Government's education reform
projects. It has also 'begun a program of curriculum development in mathematics,
science, and social studies. However, little progress has been made in the
provision of more and 'better textbooks. Some of the manuscripts developed
recently are expected to be printed and distributed under the proposed project.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
40.       The project was prepared by the Government with the assistance of
UNESCO/IBRD Cooperative Program and appraised by the Bank in June/July 1975.
Negotiations were held in Washington during January 1976 and the Philippine
delegation was led by his Excellency Eduardo Romualdez, Philippine Ambassador
to the United States.
41.       This would be the third World Bank Group operation for education
in the Philippines.   The first was a Bank loan (Loan 393-PH) of     $6 million
made in 1964 to assist the Government in financing the expansion of the
University of the Philippines College of Agriculture at Los Banos. The pro-
ject was satisfactorily completed in 1972 within the original cost estimates.
An IDA credit of    $12.7 million was approved for a second project in 1973
(Credit 349-PH) to help finance the construction of new facilities and equip-
ment for (a) a curriculum development center and four science teaching centers;
(b) thirteen agricultural high schools and two agricultural colleges; and
(c) ten regional skill training centers and three technical institutes.
The execution of this project is progressing satisfactorily and the project
is expected to be completed on schedule.
Description of the Project
42.        The basic purpose of the proposed project is to develop the
institutional capacity for the continuous development and supply of relevant
textbook material in the Philippines. This involves the establishment or
strengthening of local institutions to develop and distribute textbooks, and
the production and distribution of about 27 million textbooks as the first
phase of an eight year program to introduce about 98 million new textbooks
into public primary and secondary schools by 1984. The major part of the
project thus consists of:
(a) the procurement of furniture and equipment for the
expansion of the functions of the Textbook Board;
(b) the constructing, furnishing and equipping of two new,
and the equipping and furnishing of three existing
curriculum development centers;
(c) curriculum development, manuscript writing, testing and
revising textbooks (about 75 titles) for five primary and
secondary school subjects;
(d) trainining of about 250,000 public elementary and
secondary school teachers in the use of new textbooks;
(e) equipping 14 staff development centers and 34 develop-
ment high schools for testing textbooks and teacher training;



- 11 -
(f) the purchase of paper for, and printing and binding
of about 27 million textbooks and their distribution
to public eLementary and secondary schools;
(g)  constructing, furnishing and equipping of one national,
and 107 provincial and sub-provincial warehouses; and
(h) evaluation of the textbook program.
The other components of the project consist of the establishment of an edu-
cation management information system to provide managers with a regular flow
of up-to-date information and a pre-investment study on the use of education-
al mass media, involving particularly the use of radio and TV via satellite-
communication.
43.       In addition, the project would provide for technical assistance,
including a total of 24 man-years of fellowships and 27 man-years of local
and expatriate specialist services. Fellowships would be awarded to about
50 educators and administrators mainly for short-term training overseas
in fields related to the project, such as book production. The specialist
services would be to help the Government to develop its capacity for text-
book publishing, to establish the management information system and to under-
take the mass media pre-investment study.
Institutional Arrangements
44.       Textbooks.   The existing project unit in the DEC   (EDPITAF), which
is in charge of the Second Education project (Credit 349-PH), would also be
responsible for overall administration, financial control and liaison with
the Bank and, specifically, for the implementation of the physical facilities
and technical assistance components of the project.
45.       As mentioned earlier, a key objective of the project is strengthen-
ing the textbook development process in the Philippines. Therefore, the
Government has recently reorganized its textbook program and given responsi-
bility for all stages to the Textbook Board of DEC. The Textbook Board of DEC,
which formerly only approved manuscripts of textbooks for use in public
schools, would now be :responsible for the development, production and distri-
bution of textbooks. To perform its considerably expanded functions, the
Textbook Board would be assisted by a full-time professional secretariat which
would have about six functional units. The secretariat of the Textbook Board,
which would be responsLble for the day-to-day operations of the Textbook
Board, would be headed by a director and staffed by qualified and experienced
professional staff inc;Luding an editor-in-chief, senior advisors, designers,
teacher trainers, spec-Lalists in textbook printing and binding, paper procure-
ment and storage and textbook distribution. Revised implementing rules and
regulations of the Textbook Board have been amended to take into account its
expanded responsibilities, organizational changes and staffing requirements.
The Government has also established a schedule of the key staff appointments.
The proposed loan will not become effective until qualified and experienced
personnel have been appointed as the director of Textbook Board's secretariat,
the editor-in-chief anct the heads of its production and manufacturing units
(Section 6.01 of the Loan Agreement).

46.       An advisory council (Basic Education Textbook Development Co-
ordinating Council - BETDECCO) consisting of the representatives of various
sections of the DEC, University of the Philippines, curriculum development
centers and several other relevant organizations, including a representative
of the private Publishers/Printers Association, would advise the Secretary
of DEC and the Textbook Board on priorities for development of textbooks.
47.       The normal textbook production cycle would require one year of
planning and writing, one school year for testing and revision, and one year
for printing, binding and distribution. Although private publishers would
continue to participate, most curriculum development and manuscript writing
under the project would be conducted by five designated curriculum development
centers under contract to the Textbook Board. The five centers would develop
curricula, write manuscripts, test and revise prototype books, and train
teachers in the use of books. Testing would be conducted for a full school
year in a minimum of about 40 representative schools before full scale produc-
tion (Section 3.07 of the Loan Agreement). Purchasing paper in bulk, letting
contracts for printing and binding of books, monitoring these contracts and
managing all aspects of distribution from printers to schools would be the
responsibilities of the manufacturing unit of the Textbook Board.
48.       The project would establish a national textbook distribution system
including a central warehouse in Manila and about 107 regional and sub-
regional warehouses. Printers would deliver the textbooks to the central
warehouse; local transporters and forwarding agents, under contract to the
Textbook Board, would transport them to the provincial and sub-provincial
warehouses. Public school principals would be responsible for transport
to schools, care and storage of textbooks in the schools and their loan
to pupils. The books would be loaned free of charge and their distribution
would be on the basis of one book per subject for each two pupils in all
public schools at the relevant grade level.
49.       Under the project, 250,000 teachers would be trained in the use
of textbooks through a network comprised of the project curriculum development
centers, regional staff development centers, and development schools. At the
national level, the five project curriculum development centers would provide
training in their respective areas for the staff of 14 regional staff develop-
ment centers attached to teacher training institutions. The staff development
centers would provide training for the staff of 34 development high schools
and primary schools. The development schools would in turn conduct short
courses for teachers in their regions. Adequate language instruction for
teachers and students would be provided where necessary (Section 3.10 of the
Loan Agreement).
50.       The Textbook Board would initiate a program to evaluate the text-
books and the teacher training program under the project. The textbook
evaluation program would include collection of data on the number of books
distributed, an analysis of the results of testing prototypes and a program to
test the incremental change in pupils' acheivements as a result of provision
of textbooks. Evaluation of teacher training component would include data on
the number of workshop participants and an analysis of the effectiveness of
training in textbook use.

51.       Education Management Information System.    In support of its
reorganization and its intention to strengthen planning and management, the
DEC has embarked on a program to introduce a management information system
within its Office of Planning Services. The system would provide for
centralized computer processing of educational statistics which are neces-
sary to improve policy making, planning and administration. The introduc-
tion of the system would entail:
(a) setting priorities regarding data needs;
(b) designing and testing forms and procedures
for data collection and processing;
(c) scheduling and phasing implementation;
(d) computer programming; and
(e) staff training.
Adequate computer facilities are available.
52.       Mass Media Pre-Investment Study.   The Government is considering
the extensive use of satellite communication for radio and television and
other mass media for formal and non-formal education. In order to provide
a basis for decision-making and to select an effective strategy for introduc-
ing educational technology, the Government proposes to undertake a pre-
investment study. The study would be conducted jointly by national and
international specialisl:s under the leadership of an Inter-Agency Planning
Committee within the DEC. It is to be completed before the end of 1976 when
allocations of channels on available satellites are expected to be made.
Cost and Financing of the Project
53.       The total cost. of the project is estimated at $51.6 million, includ-
ing $25.2 million in foreign exchange (for details, see Annex III). The total
cost estimates include E. physical contingency equivalent to about 10 percent
of base cost and a pricE contingency of about 34 percent. The proposed loan
of $25 million would finance the foreign exchange component of the project;
the balance of project costs would be financed through government budgetary
allocations. The annual additional recurrent expenditure generated by this
project when it is in full operation in 1980 would be about $14.5 million (in
December 1975 prices) for additional textbooks and $0.7 million for the opera-
ting costs of the Textbook Board and curriculum development centers. Al-
together these expenditures are substantial, which would be equivalent to
about 4.4 percent of the national government expenditure on education in 1975.
In addition to the normal assurance that the Government would make the neces-
sary funds available for the proposed project, the Government has given
assurances that it would commit sufficient resources to carry through with the
second phase of the textbook program during 1981-1984 (Section 3.01 (b) of the
Loan Agreement).

Procurement and Disbursements
54.       Contracts would be grouped to the maximum extent possible.    Civil
works contracts exceeding $500,000, contracts for supply of paper above
$100,000, and equipment and furniture contracts exceeding $50,000 would be
awarded following international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines. Contracts below these amounts and those for printing would
be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and in
accordance with Government procedures which are acceptable.     The aggregrate
amount of contracts so awarded would not exceed $2 million. Foreign firms
would be allowed to participate. Local equipment, furniture and paper man-
ufacturers would be allowed a margin of preference of 15 percent or actual
customs duty, whichever is lower. In addition, miscellaneous items, under
contracts not exceeding $10,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate amount of
$250,000, would be purchased locally on the basis of at least three price
quotations.
55.       Disbursements would be made over a five-year period against:
(a) 100 percent of the c.i.f. costs of directly imported paper, equipment
and furniture; (b) 100 percent of the ex-factory price of locally manufac-
tured paper, equipment and furniture; (c) 70 percent of the cost of imported
but locally procured paper, equipment and furniture; (d) 100 percent of for-
eign or 60 percent of total expenditures for technical assistance; (e) 45
percent of total expenditures for printing and distribution of textbooks;
(f) 30 percent of the expenditures for civil works, including related profes-
sional fees; and (g) 15 percent of expenditures for textbook development and
teacher training. Retroactive financing of up to $50,000 for costs incurred
on the mass media pre-investment study after February 1, 1976 is proposed.
Justification
56.       As indicated earlier, the Philippine education system is strong
in terms of numbers of students enrolled, but weak in the quality of in-
struction provided. Insufficient and outdated textbooks has been a major
contributing factor to low educational quality. The project would provide
both the institutional development and increased textbook supply necessary
for sustained improvement of educational quality.
57.       A central objective of the project is to assist the Government in
establishing the institutional framework needed for continuous curricula
development and textbook production. Under the project, the Textbook Board
would be strengthened in authority and expertise to initiate, coordinate,
execute and supervise the full complement of textbook publishing functions.
The presently dispersed activities associated with textbook development (cur-
ricula development, manuscript preparation, testing, production, manufacture
and distribution) would be integrated under the single management of the
Textbook Board. The wider span of authority of the Board would enable it
to undertake a systematic program for developing new textbook titles.
Testing, revision and teacher training, not done at present, would be
introduced as an integral part of textbook development.

58.       Thiie strengthened mianagement of the textbook development process
should bring about over the next four years:   (a) more than a 50 percent
reduction in "he time risequired to produce new books; (b) a three fold increase
in the output of new textbook titles; Cc) a tenfold iincrease ir. the -production
capacity Fo-r ne- beoksb  (ds  a 40 percen:: -e.uction .r the average  pst Per
book; and (e) a substarntiai increase in the quality of books produced.
The increased 6iupply of- 27 mi.llion books should allow the pupil/book ratic
per subject to be reducecd from iO-.1 to 2:1, Not only would this help raise
individuai learning achlievements, but the distribu-tion of uniform textbooks
equ'ltably throughout thie country would lielp equalize educational standards
between urban and rurai areas. The provision of adequate textbooks togethler
with impioved teacher training would be an important step toward improving
curricula and classrooriL practices.  They should also reduce repeater and
dropcut rates.
59.       In the short terml, large scale publication of. textbooks by the Govern-
mer.'t may have somewhat adverse effect on private publishing industry ini the Philip-
pines. However, given limited capacity of the private sector, no feasible
alternative to publication by government is available if the current short-
age and low quality of textbook is to be remedied. In the long run, publica-
tion by the Government and private publishers would complement each other
and would be necessary to meet the growing demand for books.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
60.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article IiI,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a
draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed separately
to the Executive DirectDrs.  Features of particular interest are referred to
in paragraphs 45, 47, 49, 53 and 55 of this report. The proposed loan will
not become effective until key staff appointments have been made to the
secretariat of -he Textbook Board (Section 6.01 of the Loan Agreement).
61.       I am satisfIted that the proposed loan would comply with tlle
Articles oL Agreemenit o:E the Bank and with the established criteria for
Third Windcw loans.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
62,       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

Ln. No. 637-PH       Upper Pampanga River Irrigation; US$34.0 million Loan
of August 18, 1969; Date of Effectiveness: October 15,
1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
This is the first major irrigation project in the Philippines and
will supply water year-round to nearly all its 84,000 ha command area. The
project 's on-farm development scheme is setting a pattern for future irriga-
tion development in the country. Despite some delays caused by the 1972
floods, the dam was commissioned on September 7, 1974 ahead of schedule. Most
of the work has been completed and the loan is expected to be entirely dis-
bursed by June 30, 1976, the Closing Date. Project costs have increased 40%
over appraisal estimates, largely as a result of rapid inflation, the effects
of successive devaluations of the peso, and design changes in the dam (which
accounted for nearly half the increase in costs). The increase in costs is
being financed by the Government. However, as a result of the close coor-
dination established between irrigation and agricultural supporting services,
the project is expected to reach full development in 7 years after comple-
tion of construction, instead of 13 years which was the appraisal estimate.
Also, nearly 7,000 ha have been added to the project, mostly by including
lands which were formerly under a private irrigation system. Finally, there
has been a considerable increase in the projected world market price of rice.
As a result, the rate of return estimate is now more favorable than at
appraisal.
Ln. No. 720-PH       Rice Processing and Storage; US$14.3 million Loan of
February 4, 1971; Date of Effectiveness: May 10, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
This project provides long-tem credit through the Development
Bank of the Philippines to finance a program for the development and modern-
ization of the rice and corn processing industry. Originally the project
was restricted to rice and to the private sector, and the emphasis was on
the construction of new integrated rice mills with large capacities. Due
in part to poor harvests and in part to large cost increases for rice mills,
the demand for sub-loans for new integrated rice mills turned out to be
small, and, as expalined in the President's Memorandum dated June 8, 1972
(R72-40), the loan agreement was amended to shift the project emphasis to
rehabilitation of existing rice milling facilities. In spite of this the
project made little progress. The loan agreement was amended again in
April, 1974 basically (i) to expand the scope of the project to include

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken

understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

corn in addition to rice, (ii) to enable local governments and the National
Grains Authority to borrow funds under the project, and (iii) to streamline
procurement procedures (President's memorandum SecM74-244 of April 15, 1974).
As a result of these amendements, the project is now progressing satisfactori-
ly and the loan is expected to be fully disbursed before the revised
Closing Date, June 30, 1977.
Ln. No. 731-PH      Highway; US$8.0 million Loan of April 14, 1971;
Date of Effectiveness: July 23, 1971; Closing Date:
June 30, 1976
The project is financing the construction and improvement of the
Cotabato - Digos road in Nindanao (160 km.). Construction is only 55% com-
plete based on the original scope of works, the delay being mainly due to
civil disturbances and army activity on part of the road representing about
20% of the total roadworks. As there is little chance of the contractor
being able to enter this area, the Bank has agreed to a Government proposal
to delete this stretch of the road from the contract and eventually execute
the work by force account; the undisbursed amount of the loan fund will be
applied to the balance of works which can be completed by contract. The
total cost of the reduced project is estimated to be about US$16.4 million
compared to appraisal estimate of US$15.8 million. The increase in cost is
due to a rise in construction costs which has been substantial since oil
price increases in late 1973. The roadworks have been completed in December
1975. The other components of the project including UNDP-financed feas-
ibility studies were completed in 1973. The closing date has been extended
from May 15, 1975 to June 30, 1976. Technical assistance to the Department
of Public Highways is continuing with Bank financing under the Second High-
way Project.
Ln. No. 809-PH       Fifth Power; US$22.0 million and US$10.0 million Loan
and                 and Credit of April 3, 1972; Date of Effectiveness:
Cr. No. 296-PH      July 1, 1972; Closing Date:   June 30, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance the construction o.E a second thermal unit of 150-MW at Bataan and
transmission facilities in Luzon. The project is proceeding satisfactorily,
and the unit is expected to be commissioned during the second quarter of
1976. The erection of tranismission lines has been somewhat delayed due to
unfavorable weather and poor soil conditions and is now expected to be
completed in June 1976. Further tariff increases were approved, effective
July 1, 1974 and again in July 1, 1975, although this last increase still
has not received President:Lal approval. No major problems are anticipated.
Ln. No. 823-PH      Livestock; US$7.5 million Loan of May 25, 1972;
Date oE Effectiveness: November 9, 1972; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
The project is assisting Government in carrying out its livestock
development program through credit supervised by the Development Bank of the

Philippines. The start of DBP lending operations was delayed by about six
months because of late appointment of technical staff. Although sub-loan
commitments were slow as a result of this, they improved so that all funds
were fully committed by December, 1975. The project has expanded the
4gricultural credit capability of DBP into a new and important field thus
meeting a previously unsatisfied demand for small to medium scale livestock
development finance.
Cr. No. 471-PH      Aurora-Penaranda Irrigation; US$9.5 million Credit of
May 14, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: August 22, 1974;

Ln. No. 984-PH       Aurora-Penaranda Irrigation; US$9.5 million Loan of
May 14, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: August 22, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This is the second irrigation development and rehabilitation pro-
ject in the Philippines to be financed by the Bank. The project will divert
water from the Aurora basin into the Pantabangan Reservoir of the first pro-
ject, to provide year-round irrigation for 25,300 ha of rice land in Central
Luzon. The project also includes an Irrigation Development Study for Central
Luzon to inventory water, land, and other resources and identify priority
irrigation projects. Although there has been some delay in constructing the
two diversion dams because of the need for more extensive foundations and
abutment area grouting than originally expected, most difficulties have been
overcome and the work is progressing satisfactorily. Diversion of 75% of
Aurora water into Pantabangan Reservoir was achieved in September, 1975, one
year ahead of the appraisal schedule. In the service area, lack of competi-
tion and high bids have delayed awarding of contracts. Urgent work is being
done by Government force account, although the Credit Agreement sets a force
account limit of about 20% on civil works in the service area. Project costs
have increased about 54% over appraisal estimates, largely as a result of
rapid inflation. There would be added benefits from early diversion, however,
resulting in additional water for irrigation sooner than planned, and the
rate of return is expected to fall from 17% at appraisal to 14%.
Ln. No. 998-PH       Industrial Investment and Smallholder Tree-farmers:
US$50.0 million Loan of June 12, 1974; Date of
Effectiveness: September 9, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981
The proceeds of the loan are being relent to the Development Bank
of the Philippines (DBP). The industrial portion of the loan (US$48 mil-
lion) is being used by DBP to make sub-loans to finance direct imports for
medium and relatively large industrial projects. DBP is using the balance
(US$2 million) to finance about 1,300 smallholders in a pilot tree-farming
project. As of December 31, 1975 commitments for sub-loans totalling $37
million had been made.

Date of Effectiveness: Aug     27, 1974; Closin& Date:
December 31, 1977
The Central Bank relends the proceeds of the Loan (except for
a small amount for an evaluation study) to participating banks. These on-
lend the funds to farmers and rural entrepreneurs to finance investment in
farm mechanization, on-farm transportation, farm support facilities and
equipment, coastal and inland fisheries, small-scale livestock development
and cottage-scale agro-industry. The project also provides for a review
of the effectiveness of the First, Second and this project. The loan became
effective on August 27, 1974, and is expected to be fully committed in 1976.
Collection of arrears by a sizeable number of participating banks from bene-
ficiaries under the first and second projects is not satisfactory. This is
being watched closely by Bank staff and appropriate steps are being taken
to improve such collections.
Ln. No. 1034-Ph     Sixtlh Power; US$61.0 million Loan of July 31, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: November 15, 1974; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance a 100 MW hydro pLant at Pantabangan and transmission lines for the
further expansion of the Luzon grid and feasibility studies by consultants
for a future power project. Major equipment for the plant has been contracted
and project commissioning is expected in January 1977 - three months ahead
of original schedule. The transmission component of the project is pro-
ceeding in stages. Some lines are under construction and others are in
procurement process. The design work has been delayed due to NPC's heavy
construction program. It is now expected that this part of the project will
be completed by the end of 1978, i.e. one year behind schedule. NPC raised
its tariffs on July 1, 1974, to meet the covenanted rate of return of 8
percent. But due to infLation NPC was not able to achieve this. NPC
therefore increased tariffs on July 1, 1975, but this increase still has
not received PresidentiaL approval.
Cr. No. 349-PH      Seconid Education; US$12.7 million Credit of January 5,
1973; Date of Effectiveness: April 11, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
The Credit is helping to finance a project for development of
technical and vocational education and for improvement in curriculum devel-
opment and teacher train:Lng. Construction has been about 12 months behind
schedule mainly due to delays in the finalization of design/drawing of
buildings and recruitmenl; of specialist services. This delay is being
reduced through effective! management by the project unit. Procurement of
equipment is on schedule. Both the program and schedule of technical
assistance have been reviLsed to suit the current needs of project institu-
tions and to expedite implementation. Disbursements (US$4.9 million as
of 2/11/76) are ahead of the appraisal estimate. Project costs are
estimated at about 32 percent above the appraisal estimates. The Government
has agreed to finance the-resulting overruns. Despite initial delays, the
project is expected to be completed on schedule.

Date of Effectiveness: December 5, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30, 1979
This project is designed to provide long term credit to the
private sector through the Development Bank of the Philippines for marine
and inland fisheries development. The loan became effective on December 5,
1973. The demand for loans is adequate, and the organization to implement
them has been properly established. The project is progressing satisfactorily,
and all funds are expected to be fully committed by June, 1976.
Ln. No. 939-PH      Second Ports; US$6.1 million Loan of October 24, 1973
Date of Effectiveness: December 19, 1973; : Closing
Date: December 31, 1977
This project provides for the rehabilitation and expansion of the
ports of General Santos and Cagayan de Oro in the island of Mindanao. The
Contract for General Santos was awarded in May 1975 and work has started.
For Cagayan de Oro, a bid has been selected and award of contract is awaiting
Government approval.
Ln. No. 950-PH      Second Highway; US$68.0 million Loan of December 12,
1973; Date of Effectiveness: December 27, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project is helping the Government to implement its program of
construction, improvement and rehabilitation of highways and feeder roads,
by financing the construction, improvement and rehabilitation of 1400 kms.
of roads in Luzon. Work has begun on all fourteen contracts, ten of which
were awarded to local contractors. In line with world-wide inflation, costs
have increased sharply, but price adjustments are being awarded to contractors
by the Government to offset the sharp rises in costs of basic materials,
fuels and labor. The UNDP financed Road Feasibility Studies (Phase II),
for which the Bank is executing Agency, have been completed and a possible
Third Highway project has already been indentified and pre-appraised.
Execution of other minor project items is proceeding generally on schedule.
