Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
The project's primary objective is the construction of a commercially self-sustaining urban wholesale market for the greater Lublin
area, complete with associated physical infrastructure.
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):

Financial Charges     1.20          6
3. Benefits and target population
The main economic benefits of the proposed wholesale market will include cost savings in search, bargaining and transportation;
improved quality produce and choice; reduction of product waste and the risk of adverse selection; improved market transparency and
heightened trader competition; and the development of complementary services to traders and clients that will contribute to regional
employment and economic growth
The primary beneficiaries will be a large proportion of the 0.5 million residents within the Lublin metropolitan area, who will benefit
from improved retail services that would be facilitated through the operation of the market, and local producers within an area of 50 to
150 km from Lublin, who will gain access to a much improved infrastructure for the disposal of farm surpluses. Additionally, the
proposed market will serve as a point of aggregation and distribution for exports to the Ukraine and Russia, providing services to
producers and traders from other regions of the country.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: : five years (FY 99 -2003)
Executing agencies: The project would be executed by the Lublin Wholesale Market Company, whose corporate name is the
Lubelska Gielda Rolno-Ogronicza, Spolka Akcyjna w Lublinie (LGRO), a company incorporated in Poland as a joint stock company in
1996. It has competent management as demonstrated by its success in bringing the venture to the point of having obtained all pertinent
planning permits and having raised over PLN 14 million of equity with the participation of several hundred private shareholders. The
wholesale company will be responsible for the implementation of the construction project with the assistance of civil engineering
consultants. The company will work in close collaboration with the public works department of the city of Lublin and surrounding
municipalities which will be participating in linking water and sewer services to the proposed construction, while the city's environment
department will oversee the pollution mitigation measures that have been included in design and construction.
Project coordination and oversight: The department of wholesale markets and commodity exchanges of the Ministry of Agriculture
and Food Economy (MAFE):
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: The company will produce a standard annual report with accounts
audited by an independent certified public accountant.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: The construction will be done under one turn-key contract with periodic progress
payments as contractually agreed, and based upon monitorable progress of physical works. Construction will be supervised by a
construction management company under contract to LGRO.

Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project  [Document number and date of latest CAS report No. 16484-POL; May 1, 1997]
The proposed project would complement the Bank's role in Poland, as outlined in the existing CAS, by (i) sustaining private sector
growth, and (ii) managing the transformation of the state in support of the market economy. The first objective will be supported by
fostering private sector participation, and catalyzing private sector financing, in this key segment of the marketing infrastructure, inter
alia a core part of the strategy for successful EU integration. The second objective will be supported directly by the actual creation of
a new market institution that aids in boosting the competitiveness of the agriculture sector by reducing marketing costs and increasing
market transparency. An additional, in the context of contemporary Poland important, contribution is the creation of an estimated
2,000 new places of employment. Moreover, the proposed project will foster the devolution of development responsibilities to local
government, through its involvement in providing services infrastructure to the site.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy: The process of restructuring the Polish economy resulted in the breaking up of
cooperative marketing structures and in a consequent dispersal of trade transactions. The sector is now characterized by a lack of
organization of producers, merchants and consumers. There are few mechanisms for improving product and packaging quality, and
the current state of organization of trade, of which the urban wholesale markets are the focal point, does not favor market
transparency. Some wholesalers have set up activities on the periphery of large cities. The present conditions of these sites and their
associated infrastructure is poor in both its technical aspects and in the lack of institutional services. The proposed project directly
addresses these technical and institutional issues in supporting the construction of a modem, efficiently operating market and the
creation of entry points to the wholesale marketing system for producers, along with commercially viable services facilitating market
entry.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices: Since 1990, the Bank has had a number of operations in the
agriculture and forestry sectors in Poland, including an ASAL of $300 million, two agricultural credit projects of $100 million each
and a forestry project of $146 million. Based on this involvement with Polish agriculture and its institutions over the last six years,
particularly in the context of the ASAL, the Bank has substantial in-depth knowledge of the sector and of the environment in which
marketing occurs. A sector-wide study that preceded the formulation of the ASAL had identified early the need to establish and
encourage market exchange facilities at the producer/ primary wholesaler and processor levels, recognizing that such activities would
require some public investment at state and local government levels, but would also need to become self-financing.
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection: Expansion and modernization of an existing network of smaller
markets lacking even the most basic infrastructure such as running water, electricity or hard surface was rejected due to location, cost
of upgrade and lack of space. The proposed site was chosen on the basis of its location and in general agreement with the surrounding
municipalities.
9. Major related projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies. The Poznan wholesale market was
established in 1992 with monetary and technical assistance from a Swiss development related organization. It has exceeded
expectations with respect to volume and variety of throughput. Financing for a wholesale market for the city of Gdansk, similar to the
one proposed for Lublin, was presented to the board on July 23; the loan agreement is expected to be signed on August 29.
10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design: From an economic standpoint the Poznan wholesale market has been a
successful venture since it has significantly contributed to reduction in the search and distribution costs of food stuff, particularly
produce, in its geographical area while simultaneously allowing more transparency of the market pricing for the producer. A major
problem has been that due to ownership structure and tenancy agreements, the market has been unable to adjust its fee and rental
schedule in step with inflation, creating a risk of financial failure in the long run.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership: The proposed borrower, the Lublin Wholesale Market Company, and its
shareholders, have demonstrated their commitment by securing and contributing required equity financing for the investment, by
cooperation with Bank staff in the processing of the project and by securing pertinent notarized permits, land deed documentation
and other required official papers with the local government; and by securing required equity financing for the investment. Local
government demonstrated its commitment to the project by appropriating funds for the construction of linking services infrastructure
to the site of the proposed market.
12. Value added of Bank support: Institutionally, the Bank's involvement in the proposed project would lend considerable
credibility to the formation of a business partnership between public entity shareholders and private sector investors -- a business
venture whose potential risks the weakly developed capital market in Poland would have otherwise not been willing to accept. The
Bank's involvement would promote small shareholding, which would help shift the incidence of investment risk in ways that would
enable local capital markets to respond more flexibly to the financing requirements of privatization and private sector economic
growth.



Poland: Wholesale Markets Project II                                                                 Page 4
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the project file. See Annex 8)
13. Economic Assessment (see Annex 4):
Cost-Benefit Analysis : ERR= 20% ((Represents most likely lower bound for expected market performance.)
The proposed project would introduce a number of benefits which are not easily quantifiable. Among them are reductions in search,
transaction and transport costs, reductions in product waste, improvements in product choice and quality, improved reliability of supplies
to retailers and consumers, improved market transparency and more competitive trader participation. The cost-benefit analysis of the
project establishes a lower bound for the project's economic rate of return by estimating the reduction in current search and collection costs
that can be achieved with the operation of the market.
Fiscal impact: Positive: at full development (five years from the start of construction) the operation of the wholesale market should
generate annual tax revenues in excess of US$1 million equivalent.
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5)
FRR = 12.1% (real rate of return on total capital for the wholesale market company)
Real return on equity = 23.8%
The results of modeling of the expected financial performance of the Lublin wholesale market company are displayed in the cash flows,
income statements, balance sheets and tables of financial ratios available in the project file, a summary of which is in Annex 5. In
general, the returns to the company are quite strong under a variety of financing arrangements. Given present expectations of the flow of
rental income that the company will earn from the development of the property, expectations that foresee constant real revenues over the
operational period, the rate of return to the company's investment should compare satisfactorily with other local property development.
The returns on investment, although not especially high in real terms in these projections, are of relatively low risk, and would provide
comfortable debt service coverage of the Bank loan.
The total cost of the investment is estimated at about US$ 19.36 million (PLN 77.14 in current zloties over three years) including prestart
costs incurred before 1998. The fnancing plan assumed for this document is one where the Bank provides financing of US$ 11.12
million as a long-term loan, representing about 57 percent of total costs. Local sources provide the remaining financing, including US$
5.44 million of shareholder equity (constituting 28 percent of the total financing required) , US$0.98 from the sale of sites along the
highway running adjacent to the site (about 5% of total financing required) and US$1.98 million (about 10% of total investment costs)
from the sale and leaseback of steel frameworks of structures completed in the early phases of construction. Of the total equity amount,
approximately US$ 3.6 million was raised prior to March 1998 in cash and the value of donated land.
The Wholesale Market Company has entered into contracts amounting to PLN 16.06 million (approximately US$4.03 million) for the first
phase of construction and a small amount of equipment (valued at about US$0.03 million). The Bank will finance the remaining
construction works to be undertaken, which amount to PLN 49.16 million (approximately US$11.38), disbursing 80 percent against these
expenditures for a total of PLN 39.02 (approximately US$9.80 million). The Bank loan will also finance the first three years of interest
and fees accruing against the borrowing for construction and equipment, which will amount to PLN 4.70 (about US$1.18 million).
15. Technical Assessment:
The detailed design of the market draws from the technical features of comparable European facilities and incorporates modern features
that will anticipate compliance with EU regulations in advance of Poland's accession. Practically, planning for the project has also
benefited from the operational experiences of the earlier discussed, similar, wholesale market that opened in 1992 in the western city of
Poznan. The design complies with pertinent requirements of Poland's Environmental Law, the Law on Sanitary Inspection and the Law
on Fire Protection. Technically, the present design for the market is sound and will provide flexibility for the addition of future structural
enhancements and market services.

16. Institutional Assessment:
a. Executing agency:
Lubelska Gielda Rolno Ogrodnicza S.A.(Lublin Wholesale Company, Inc.) The president of the company has managed a successful
agricultural cooperative, before this was disbanded. He is credited with having saved the cooperative financially in the early '90's when as
a result of the economic shock applied by the, then, government, many organizations of a similar nature went bankrupt on account of
spiraling debt charges. The president of the wholesale market, when managing director of the cooperative, paid off most debts before the
substantial interest rate increases that occurred on account of the economic shock therapy applied. The vice president of the company is a
civil engineer with a distinguished career in his field. During project preparation company management has shown the aptitude and
managerial talents that give confidence in their abilities to exercise the considerable responsibilities entailed in construction and operation.
b. Project management: The project will be managed by the executing agency described and summarily evaluated above.
17. Social Assessment: Not Applicable
18. Environmental Assessment:        Environmental Category              Z    A    L      B   E   C
The project poses potential problems of traffic congestion and disposal of sewage and may have esthetic consequences for nearby
residential developments. An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been made and a summary has been submitted to the
Executive Directors. Mitigation measures recommended in the EIA have been included in the project's costs. In summary, these are: the
development of on-site water treatment and the installation of a sewage system connecting into the system managed by the municipality;
and suitable landscaping.

Note: IS = information sharing; CON = consultation; COL = collaboration
20. Sustainability: The long-run sustainability of the market company will depend upon the evolving nature of the agricultural marketing
environment and its ability to position itself strategically in anticipation of events affecting its operations, such as an expansion of Western
European supermarket chains into Poland. A state owned and managed company is less likely to be as flexible and reactive as would be
needed in the potentially turbulent environment ahead than one owned and managed in the private sector.

Wholesale Markets Project II
Detailed Project Description
L.      Wholesale market construction (US$19.36 million total)
*   The construction of a multi-purpose fresh produce trading hall, with a single screened top-light central buyer's
walk area with wholesaler's units on either side in 6 meter wide bays, with draught lobbies at each end of the
walk, closed by rubber doors, which would also act as access to public toilets/hand washing facilities.
*  Building a dry goods market of identical dimension , layout and construction to that of the fresh produce trading
hall;
*   The establishment of individual, medium to large-wholesaler's units in garage-type structure - each unit with its
own roller-shutter door and access ramp available for use of a wide range of activities, -the tenants being
responsible for fitting-out to meet Polish and EU norms for hygiene and food handling (e.g. enclosed docking,
overhead railing, washing/changing facilities, etc.);
*   The construction of a hall for the sale of flowers and pot plants, with multiple buyers walks to maximize display
areas and with a high level (>1,000 lux) of artificial (fluorescent) and screened-natural day-lighting. Plentiful
supplies of water, adequate floor drainage and non-slip floor finishes would be provided. Partial humidity and
temperature control (at around 13°C) would be used in the main circulation areas and wholesalers would be
expected to have their own cool stores at the back of their stands for short-term storage;
*   The establishment of an open farmers' market, operating from a separate parking area and partially covered by a
continuous walkway at the point of sale, incorporating grower's display stands;
*   The construction of semi-wholesalers/retailers booths for smaller traders in a segregated area of the wholesale
market with its own vehicle access and parking,
*   Building a two-story market administration office complex, totaling 1,000 m2, including training and MIS
extension facilities, an environmental health laboratory, broker's offices, a bank, a restaurant, workshops and first
aid/welfare facilities as well as ancillary facilities, including amenity buildings (cafes and toilets), gate houses,
and buildings for electrical transformer and sewage pumping;
*   Establishment of on-site infrastructure, which would include: on-site earthworks and site preparation works;
roads and circulation areas and an extensive area for market users and visitor's parking of around 1,660 places;
road signage; pavements and ramps; planting and grassing; boundary fencing and automatically-controlled gates;
a water distribution fire/hydrant system, with a pump and 150,000 liter elevated storage tank (providing one full
day's supply); a filtered surface water drainage system, with separated systems for run-off from roads/parking
areas and building roofs, and from an isolated vehicle re-fuelling/solid waste compaction area; a low voltage
electrical supply network, providing communal supplies to building and street/site lighting, and with individual
pay meters for market users; a gravity sewerage system going to an on-site pumping station; and connections to a
telephone system with a potential for 200 lines;
*   The implementation of environmental mitigation measures including: soft landscaping and tree planting adjacent
to the site boundaries; soil conservation measures, including terracing, bounding and gully checking; acoustic
barriers along the main road; and surface water drainage interceptors for filtering hydrocarbons;
*   The connection to off-site infrastructure, including approach roads and grade separated junction to the main road;
connection to the mains water supply and to the mains gravity sewer (through a pumping mains); and two high
voltage electrical supply connections from main substations to a 550-630 kVA oil-cooled electrical transformer.
*   Pre-startup expenses of the Wholesale Company, amounting to about US$0.58 million.
*   Interest and other financial charges during the first three years of project implementation, amounting to about
US$1.20 million.

Principal economic benefits include:
-- a reduction in the costs, incurred by retailers and final consumers, for searching and procuring supplies;
-- a reduction in the administrative costs of existing small wholesalers who would consolidate operations at the market;
-- a reduction in consumer prices or improvement of value of expenditure through an expansion of consumer choice
and/or improvements in the quality of selection;
-- an improvement in farmer incomes through production geared to higher quality and trading opportunities; and
-- income multiplier effects through an induced expansion of agricultural services for value-added production and trade.
Of these benefits, available data most easily permit an estimation of the first. The magnitude of other potential benefits
are less readily determined without further detailed surveys, prior and subsequent to the development of the market, but
an attempt is made to bracket their possible ranges in identifying key parameters on which they depend. The reduction
of the transaction costs incurred by purchasers (mainly retailers) searching for supplies is an adequate measure of the
project's profitability.
Main Assumptions:
Reduced transaction costs and more regular supplies of cost-effective ranges of goods to retailers are translated into
producer and consumer surpluses.
A reduction in retailers' search and collection costs of zl 70-80 per ton of produce (zl 75 per ton is the most likely value).
Initially affected consumption, measured as market throughput, lies between 190,500 and 317,500 tons (equivalent to a
market throughput of 15-25 t/m2 -- the most likely value corresponds to a base throughput of 20 trm2).
The effects of rising incomes on consumer demand and market throughput are nil over time.
The price elasticity of demand for fruit and vegetables is -0.51.
Improvements in the reliability, range and quality of produce through the market will stimulate an expansion of retail
trade (for the analysis this expansion is restricted to a level that would just compensate for the reduction in revenue that
retailers would realize in passing on the benefits of the search and collection costs to consumers -- due to the inelasticity
of demand for market produce).
An opportunity cost of land of zl 407,200/ha (US$135,000/ha) -- this value represents a NPV of 12% and current
expectations of the speculative ground rents that would be received from areas on the site owned but not developed by
the company.
2 The financial analysis of the project concerns the performance and profitability of the Lublin Wholesale Market Company; refer to Annex 5 for items
from the company's projected cash flow statement, income statement, finding statement, balance sheet and financial ratios.
I Project costings assume an average tax content of about 15 percent for the costs of construction materials and services. N.B. The Bank finances at a
disbursement rate that excludes taxes.
4 The project should help create employment opportunities in the region, reducing the need for income support.

The standard conversion factor (SCF) is 0.9; the period of analysis is 25 years; the opportunity cost of capital (OCC) is
12%.

Investment costs: an increase of 30 percent over base estimates.
Annual operating costs: an increase of 40 percent over base estirnates.
Initial market throughput: 17 tt m2.
Search and collection savings: zl 60/t.
Total annual benefits: a decrease of 20 percent below base estimates.
