INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO FIJI
FOR A HOUSING PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Fiji for US$16.2 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The loan would
have a term of 17 years including 5 years grace, at the standard variable
interest rate, and would assist in financing the Government's efforts in
housing and urban development. A part of the loan proceeds (US$14.5 million
equivalent) would be onlent to the Fiji Housing Authority for a term of 17
years including a five-year grace period at a market-based variable interest
rate (currently 8.52). The Government would bear the foreign exchange risk.
The project would be cofinanced by ADB ( loan of $10.1 equivalent at standard
terms plus a small technical assistance grant), and grants of US$1.1 million
and US$0.3 million from Japan and UNDP respectively.
2.       Background.  Of Fiji's total population of 715,000 (1986 census),
nearly 40? live in urban areas. Over 75? of this urban population lives in
the cities of Suva (the capital) and Lautoka. The urban population has been
growing at about 2.6? per annum versus 1.92 for the total population. This
growth, which adds 1,400 new urban households every year, has generated strong
demand for housing in urban areas. The public and private sectors have been
increasingly unable to meet the housing needs of the lower and middle income
groups resulting in a growing backlog (currently estimated at about 8,000
households) of unmet housing demand and increasing squatting (about 5,000
households).
3.       Key Sector Issues.  There are four major issues in the sectort
(a) Fiji lacks coherent housing and urbanization policies resulting in
unclear and overlapping responsibilities among sector agencies and
preventing the development of effective responses to urban growth and
housing demand;
(b) Housing development standards are inappropriate - plot size,
infrastructure and housing standards have all increased in recent
years; the costs associated with these sthAdards have risen faster
than incomes and lower income groups have been increasingly unable to
afford formal sector housing;
(c) Land management and planning capabilities require strengthening; to
date urban development in Fiji has taken place on freehold and Crown
land reserved for this purpose; development has almost exhausted
these reserves and there will be no further alienation of native land
into freehold or Crown ownership; and
(d)  The Housing Authority (HA), which is the most important sector agency
and the largeLt housing development and mortgage finance institution
in the country, is in serious difficulty; HA suffers from conflicting



-2-
objectives, poor operating policies, staffing gaps and organizational
weaknesses, and increasing operating losses.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  As the first Bank operation in the
sector, the project focuses on rectifying critical institutional, technical
and financial problems constraining the sector as well as formulating the
sound policy framework required for future development. Once appropriate
design standards have been successfully employed in the public sector housing
program to the benefit of lower income households and once sector
institutions, especially HA, are operat-ng on a technically and financially
viable basis, future Bank assistance might focus on longer range objectives:
enhanced private sector involvement in low income housing development and
finance, improved financial intermediation for housing, and integration of
housing finance in the financial sector.
5.       The Bank's ongoing and proposed lending in road rehabilitation (Road
Upgrading Project - Loan 2871-FIJ) and telecommunications (Third
Telecommunications Project - Loan 3074-FIJ), as well as the proposed housing
project, support GOF's recovery program by providing or improving key
infrastructure and services needed by the productive sectors. The proposed
housing investment would generate employment by stimulatinS the construction
sector and related industries (building materials, home furnishings, etc.)
The housing would be targeted to the areas where industry is or will be
located and to the workforce required by industry. A better housed workforce
near sources of employment should lead to increased productivity.
6.       Proiect Obiectives.  The objectives of the project are: (a) improved
housing and urbanization policies and standards appropriate to lower-income
housing; (b) strengthened sector institutions; and (c) increased provision of
affordable housing to lower-income groups.
7.       Proiect Description.  The proposed project, to be implemented over
seven years (1989-95), would comprises (a) formulation of new housing and
urbanization policies and operational approaches to urban development through
technical assistance, training and equipment to the Ministry of Housing and
Urban Development (MHUD); (b) institutional strengthening of: (i) urban
planning capability of the Town and Country Planning Department (TCPD); (ii)
land use planning capability of the Native Lind Trust Board (NLTB); and the
operations and financial management of HA through technical assistance,
training and equipment; and (c) land development and housing through (i)
development of 3,181 new residential plots; (ii) house construction finance
for the 3,181 new plots (iii) house construction finance for 2,000 existing
plots; and (iv) rehabilitation of 720 rental units for sale.
8.       The total project cost and financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
IBRD funds would finance land development and house construction as well as
institutional strengthening for HA and NLTB and the operationalization of



- 3 -
urban policies for MHUD. The ADB loan has already been signed and would
finance land development, house construction and institutional strengthening
for TCPD.  UNDP would finance policy development for MHUD and the Japanese
grant would cover most of the institutional strengthening requirements of HA.
Procurement and disbursement arrangements are summarized in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project process.ng events and the status of Bank operations
in Fiji are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map is also atteched,
a Staff Appraisal Report No. 7643-FIJ dated March 19, 1990 is being
distributed separately.
9.       Agreed Actions.  GOF has endorsed a detailed revitalization plan for
HA including policy, financial, organizational and operational changes to
bring about its financial viability and enable it to develop affordable
housing for lower and middle income groups. A broad outline of a plan has
also been agreed for the restructuring of the public rental housing program.
As conditions of effectiveness: (a) GOF and HA would execute a subsidiary loan
agreemen" for the onlending of Bank loan proceeds; (b) HA would revise its
bidding procedures and draft bid documents; (c) HA would transfer to the
Public Rental Board the assets and liabilities of the public rental housing
program. As disbursement conditions: (a) HA would formulate and submit to the
Bank for review the criteria for project sites to be developed in response to
demand; and (b) GOP would develop and submit to the Bank for review a detailed
plan for the rental restructuring program. Assurances were obtained that GOF
would causet (a) timely and complete provision of offsite infrastructure for
project site: (b) annual review with Bank of HA's program, budget and
financial performance; (c) the HA revitalization and rental restructuring
plans to be implemented; (d) implementation of institution building components
by the Town and Country Planning Department and the Native Land Trust Board;
(e) formulation of housing and urbanization policies, urban and land use
planning standards and building codes and their submission to the Bank for
review by June 30, 1993; (f) appointment of consultants acceptable to the Bank
by December 31, 1990 for the operationalization of policies, standards and
codes; (g) prompt handover by HA of completed infrastructure to the relevant
agencies for operation and maintenance and acceptance by these agencies of O&M
responsibility; and (h) appropriate return on equity by HA and progressive
reduction by HA of the ratio of its operating expenses to its average total
assets.
10.      Benefits and Risks.  The project would provide affordable housing to
about 6,000 low and moderate income households, reaching down to the lowest
13th percentile of the urban income distribution. The revitalization of HA
and the restructuring of the public rental program would generate important
financial benefits for GOP by reducing or eliminating subsidies and improving
cost recovery. Project-financed house construction would create about 2,000
jobs. Environmental conditions would be improved through the extension of
water and sewerage services to project beneficiaries, including about 70
squatter households. Institutional strengthening and policy development would
improve resource allocation in the urban sector. The economic rate of return
on housing developed under the project is estimated to be about 132.



- 4 -
11.      The main risks are that: (a) GOF will be unwilling or unable to meet
its policy and financial commitments to the restructuring of HA and the public
rental housing program and (b) demand for project-financed housing will not
materialize. Vhese risks are mitigated by (a) GOF's already demonstrated
commitment to its sound economic recovery program and substantial actions
already taken to complete much of the reform agenda for HA and the rental
program and (b) conservative tailoring of the project in light of current
demand.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
