HOUSING PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:             Fiji
Beneficiaries:        Housing Authority (HA), Native Land Trust Board,
Public Rental Board
Amount:               US$16.2 million equivalent
Terms:                Repayable in 17 years, including 5 years grace, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate.
On-lending Terms:    Part of the proceeds of the loan, equivalent to
US$14.5 million, would be onlent by GOF to HA for 17
years including 5 years of grace at a variable market-
based interest rate (currently 8.5Z). GOF would bear
the foreign exchange risk.
Project Objectives:  The objectives of the project are: (a) improved
housing and urbanization policies and development
standards appropriate to lower-income housing;
(b) strengthened sector institutions; and
(c) increased provision of affordable housing to
lower-income groups.
Project Description: The proposed project, to be implemented over a six
year period (1990-95), would comprise: (a) formulation
of new housing and urbanization policies and opera-
tional approaches to urban development through techni-
cal assistance, training and equipment to the Ministry
of Housing and Urban Development; (b) institutional
strengthening of: (i) urban planning capability of the
Town and Country Planning Department; (ii) land use
planning capability of the Native Land Trust Board;
and the operations and financial management of HA
through technical assistance, training and equipment;
and (c) land development and housing through (i) deve-
lopment of 3,320 new residential plots; (ii) house
construction finance for the 2,000 existing plots; and
(iii) rehabilitation of 720 rental units for sale.
Benefits:             The project would provide affordable housing to about
6,000 low and moderate income households, reaching the
13th percentile of the urban income distribution. The
revitalization of HA and the restructuring of the
public rental program would generate important finan-
cial benefits for GOF by reducing or eliminating sub-
sidi'es and improving cost recovery. Project-financed
house construction would create about 2,000 jobs.
This document has a restricted distribution and may be used by recipients only in the performance
of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



Environmental conditions would be improved through the
extension of water and sewerage services to project
beneficiaries, iincluding about 70 squatter households.
Institutional st:rengthening and policy development
would improve resource allocation in the urban sector.
Risks:                The main risks are that: (a) GOF will be unwilling or
unable to meet iits policy and financial commitments to
the restructuring of HA and the public rental housing
program and (b) demand for project-financed housing
will not materialize. These risks are mitigated by
(i) GOF's already demonstrated commitments to
reforming the housing program and making required
changes to standards and practices; and (ii)
conservative tailoring of the project in light of
current demand.

HOUSING PROJECT
I. SECTOR BACKGROUND AND ISSUES
1.1      Key Sector Issues.  There are four major issues in the sector:
(a) Fiji lacks coherent housing and urbanization policies resulting in
unclear and overlapping responsibilities among sector agencies and
preventing the development of effective responses to urban growth
and housing demand;
(b) Housing development standards are inappropriate - plot size,
infrastructure and housing standards have all increased in recent
years; the costs associated with these standards have risen faster
than incomes and lower income groups have been increasingly unable
to afford formal sector housing;
(c) Land management and planning capabilities require strengthening;
to date urban development in Fiji has taken place on freehold and
Crown land reserved for this purpose; development has almost
exhausted these reserves and there will be no further alienation
of native land into freehold or Crown ownership; and
(d) The Housing Authority (HA), which is the most important sector
agency and the largest housing development and mortgage finance
institution in the country, is in serious difficulty; HA has
suffered from conflicting objectives, poor operating policies,
staffing gaps and organizational weaknesses, and increasing
operating losses.
Urban Growth
1.2      Of Fiji's total population of 715,000 (1986 census), nearly 40Z, or
about 277,000 people, live in the country's 15 cities and towns. The total
population growth rate is 1.9Z while the rate for urban areas is 2.6Z. At
these growth rates, the population will be 45Z urban by the year 2000. Of the
total urban population, 62Z (about 172,000 people) is found in the metropoli-
tan area of the capital, Suva (including Lami and Nausori), and another 14Z
(about 40,000 people) in the second largest city, Lautoka. The two major
urban areas grew somewhat faster than urban population as a whole, 2.8Z and
3.1%, respectively.
Employment, Incomes and Poverty
1.3      Nationally, agriculture (particularly sugar) and services (especially
tourism) provide the bulk of employment--about 70Z of the labor force (in
1988). Although separate statistics are not maintained for cities and towns,
urban employment is generally known to be provided by the services sector,
wholesale and retail trade, manufacturing and construction. Unemployment in



-2-
1986 was 7.5Z but rose to 10.2Z following the economic downturn that began in
1987. The decline in business activity led to widespread layoffs, particu-
larly in the building and construction sector (employment down 17% from 1986),
and real wages fell, especially in the public sector where wages were cut by
up to 20Z. While GDIP declined by nearly 9Z in 1987 and economic activity
remained weak in 1988, the labor force continues to grow at 2.3% p.a.. Agri-
culture and tourism (largely rural-based) will absorb much of this growth but
a large share of the additional jobs will have to be found in the cities and
towns. Emigration of professionals in a number of fields (5,118 Fijians in
1987) has created staffing gaps in both the public and private sector,
especially in urban areas, and has caused a shortage of skills in critical
occupations, including medicine, law, accounting and engineering.
1.4      GNP per capita was US$1,510 in 1987, down from US$1,730 in 1986.
Compared to many developing countries, urban incomes in Fiji are relatively
evenly distributed.  The median monthly urban household income in 1988 was
about F$375 (US$255) and about 50% of urban households earned between F$200
and F$500 (US$136 and US$340).11 About 15Z of households earn less than the
approximate urban poverty threshhold of F$173 per month (US$118).2/
Housing in the Econoff
1.5      Separate statistics are unavailable for housing, but the building and
construction and public utilities sectors, in which housing plays a large
part, are important sectors of the economy, together generating 7Z-8Z of GDP
in the early 1980's (this declined to 6% in 1987) and 11Z-12Z of total employ-
ment during the same period (about 8.5% in 1987). Gross output in the
building and construction sector in 1984 wqas F$123.5 million, two thirds of
this from the private sector. However, this figure was down over 20Z from
1983, due mainly to declining public sector activity.
Housing in the Financial Sector
1.6      Financial Sector.  The Fijian financial sector is relatively advanced
for a country of its size and stage of economic development. There are a
large number of different type institutions operating within the country
including a central bank (the Reserve Bank of Fiji), five commercial banks
(4 private, 1 government-owned), a development bank, a finance company (the
Merchant Bank of Fiji), a national provident fund, three life insurance
companies, four general insurance companies, one reinsurance company, two
specialized housing finance institutions (Housing Authority and Home Finance
Company), over 500 savings and credit cooperatives, 39 land purchase and
housing societies, and a unit trust operat:ion. There are also the beginnings
of number of financial markets including an interbank market, a market in
Treasury bills, promissory notes, government and public sector bonds, and a
form of stock exchange. Of these institutions, the Fiji National Provident
Fund (FNPF) is by far the most important with control of some 32% of financial
sector assets, followed by Fiji's five conmercial banks which together have
1/ Based on 1982 GOF survey data updated to 1988 by the appraisal mission.
2/ Based on HA estimate of household inceme required for basic shelter,
food and clothing.



31Z and the Reseive Bank with 14X. The two specialized housing finance insti-
tutions (HA and EFC) together hold just over 7X of financial sector assets.
1.7      In the 1980s GOF began a process of deregulation of the financial
sector which removed or reduced some restrictions on banking. Interest rates
are free from direct control although the central bank (Reserve Bank of Fiji)
continues to influence rate setting (particularly on savings deposits) by
financial institutions through persuasion and its control of public sector
fund raising. Due to the deregulation, Fiji has a relatively free and
efficient financial sector by developing country standards, but further reform
is needed in a number of areas, including investment restrictions on the
insurance industry and FNPF, local borrowing restrictions on foreign
companies, directed credit requirements to the agricultural sector and a
number of restrictions impeding the development of private mortgage lending.
1.8      Housing Finance.  The provision of mortgage finance in Fiji is rela-
tively segmented by income group and is dominated by the public sector. Low-
and middle-income households 3/ are to be served by the government-owned
Housing Authority (average loan approximately F$7,700), although its cheapest
house/plot product in 1988 was not affordable below the urban median income.
The needs of middle and some upper income households, particularly civil
servants, are addressed by the majority Government-owned Housing Finance
Company 4/ (average loan approximately F$20,000) and the balance of upper-
income needs are served by the commercial banks and insurance companies. HA
and HFC are not deposit-taking institutions and must raise loans to finance
their operations. FNPF 5/ is the main source of long-term loans for HA and
HFC and also permits its contributors to borrow substantial portions of their
pension balances for housing downpayments. Mortgage loans outstanding in
financial institutions as of the end of 1987 (about F$270 million) represented
13% of the total assets of the financial sector. FNPF held 44% of this out-
3/ The Housing Authority's legally defined target group was, until mid-
1988, workers earning a maximum of F$140/week. This has been generally
considered the lower income group. However, the upper limit of this
income range represents about the 75th percentile on the urban income
distribution and the HA target group cannot be said to be limited to
lower income households. After mid-1988, the HA still serves a wide
income spectrum (now defined as the 20th to 80th percentiles) but with
greater emphasis below the median income.
4/ It has not been generally recognized that HA and HFC serve overlapping
groups, although this is evident since HA's redefinition of its upper
limit at the 80th percentile. Some competition is not undesirable and
there is also some complementarity in that some households buy a plot
from HA (with HA mortgage finance) and borrow from HFC for house
construction.
5/  FNPF is a well-managed government-owned non-bank financial institution
established in 1966 to provide pension coverage to all employees in
Fiji. All employers are required to contribute 141 of wages and
salaries with half of that being deducted from the employees' own
wages. In addition to the normal withdrawals by participants after
retirement, FNPF permits participants to borrow a portion of their
accumulated contributions for downpayments against housing purchase and
has through this mechanism built a large portfolio of mortgage loans.

standing housing finance, HA held 25%, HFC 15Z, the five commercial banks 1OZ,
life insurance companies almost 5%, and the balance by housing cooperatives.
1.9      Mortgage lenders charge uncontrolled variable market rates ranging
from 10.5Z to 13.5Z. HA and HFC rates (12Z and 11.5%, respectively) currently
fall in this range and are therefore con3idered market rates. By comparison,
inflation in recent years (1985-88) has averaged 4.7Z. The Central Bank's
current (February, 1989) minimum lending rate to commercial banks in mid-1989
was 11.5Z. Short term interest rates are depressed by the current recession.
The most recent GDF Treasury bill rate was 0.4Z (weighted average) and promis-
sory notes averaged 0.74Z (28 days) and L.34Z (56 days). Mortgage repayment
terms range from 10 to 30 years (8-12 years for commercial banks). Other
requirements of mortgage lenders are fairly uniform except for loan-to-value
ratios for which HA allowed 90Z (until 1988), HFC 80Z and commercial banks and
insurance companies 60-80Z.
Housing Demand and Supply
1.10     Housing Stock.  The 1986 census reported that about 57Z of urban
households owned their dwellings while 23% lived in rented quarters and 7Z
were squatters (the balance lived in insl:itutional or employer-provided
housing). The housing stock is of relatively high standard, both in terms of
materials and services. In 1986 only 3Z of urban dwellings were considered to
be constructed of traditional or makeshilft materials (implying that many
squatter dwellings are well-built). Over 90Z of urban dwellings had piped
water and 75Z had electricity. Concerning sanitary facilities, just over 60Z
of urban dwellings had flush toilets, 10Z had water-seal toilets and 26Z had
pit latrines.
1.11     Demand.  According to the 1986 census, there were nearly 50,000 urban
households, of which nearly 52Z involved extended or composite family situa-
tions. A substantial number of these situations involve newly formed house-
holds living with relatives while searching for or accumulating savings for
housing, indicating a large accumulated demand for housing. The scope of this
accumulated demand is partially indicatecd by the almost 8,000 active applica-
tions on file with public sector agencies. About 6,000 of these are for
housing in Suva and Lautoka and two-thirds are from households earning less
than the median incoime. New household formation is adding demand for 1,400
housing units annually in urban areas (about 1,200 in Suva and Lautoka). By
1995, about 14,500 additional urban households will have been formed, 85Z of
which (over 12,000) will have been in gre!ater Suva and Lautoka.
1.12     Supply.  Land development for re!sidential purposes in urban areas for
middle and lower income households is a virtual monopoly of a single public
sector agency, the Housing Authority (HA), which enjoys privileged access to
long-term financing from public sector pension funds. However, all HA land
development is carriied out by private construction companies under contract.
Private developers (several real estate and land development firms) serve the
needs of the upper income group. The private sector has not been active in
the middle and lower income market, due in part to ample returns in the upper
income market (which was very active until the events of 1987) and higher
risks associated with a lower income clientele but also because of inability



- 5 -
to compete with HA's privileged position.6/ House construction is entirely a
private sector activity involving primarily small contractors although HA
provides mortgage finance for house construction for the middle and lower
income groups. While upper income demand has been well served, the supply of
affordable housing for middle and lower income has not been adequate, particu-
larly in the last several years. HA has been consistently unable to meet its
plot production targets while building up an inventory of expensive and
difficult-to-market plots. Squatting is a growing problem, especially in Suva
(12.5Z of the population in 1987) and is indicative of a lack of affordable
housing for lower-income groups. The fact that the cheapest public sector
housing unit in 1988 was not affordable below the median urban income supports
this conclusion.
1.13     Progressively rising standards for land use and construction 7/ and
inefficiencies in production and financing have caused housing costs to rise
faster than incomes and lower-income groups have become increasingly unable to
afford formal sector housing. Government noted in the last development plan
(1986) that 46% of Fiji's wage-earning population and 87Z of households on the
public sector housing waiting list could not afford the cheapest public sector
unit. For reasons already noted (para. 1.11), the private sector has not
served this market except for house construction on already serviced plots.
These factors have resulted in an increasing backlog of demand for housing at
the lower end of the income distribution.
1.14     In spite of its shortcomings, the public sector housing program,
undertaken by the Housing Authority, has been very significant in terms of
expenditure and output as shown in the table below:
6/ HA is not prohibited from financing land development by private
developers and in fact did so on one occasion in recent years, but the
experience was a bad one as the developer abandoned the project after
drawing substantial funds from HA when the Suva City Council insisted
that certain infrastructure standards be changed.
7/ The unnecessarily high standards in force in 1987 included minimum 9
meter width tar-sealed roads, individual road access to all plots,
minimum 400 square meter plots for detached houses and completion of an
enclosed permanent structure of at least three rooms, including
kitchen, before plot occupancy. In addition, cyclone resistance
standards were rigidly and unimaginatively applied leading to
unnecessarily heavy and costly structures.

Average annual expenditure during this period was F$9.75 million and average
annual sales were 1,600 units. With annual urban household formation at 1,400
(in 1986), the program was, at least in gross numbers, meeting urban popula-
tion growth requirements as well as reducing the accumulated demand and
addressing some of the replacement needs. Sales peaked in 1982 and in capital
expenditure in 1983 but both began dropping sharply in 1986, a trend worsened
by the economic downturn that began in 1987. In the face of poor demand and
due to production inefficiencies and financial and other problems,8/ HA works
in progress doubled between 1983 and 1987 and completed but unsold and/or
unoccupied plots increased to 3,659 units in August 1988.
Land
1.15     There are three basic forms of land ownership in Fiji:
(a)  native land, held by large ethnic Fijian family/clan groups with
complex systems of ownership rights; native land accounts for almost
83Z of the total area of the country;
(b) Crown land, owned by Government and accounting for about 7Z of the
total; and
(c) freehold land, owned by individuals, organizations or businesses,
accounting for about 1OZ.
This breakdown of ownership has been effectively frozen since independence
(1970), when Governrment last exercised its power to acquire land, and is
unlikely to change significantly.
1.16     The existing stock of freehold land is bought and sold, title passing
with the sale.  Government allocates Crown land for development, generally to
public entities, but: retains title, giving the developer a long-term lease
(Crown land leaseholds for housing are generally for 99 years). The Ministry
of Lands and Mineral Resources manages Crown land. Native land is also
8/ Details of HA's managerial, organizational problems are found in
Chapter II and analysis of its financial problems in Chapter IV.



leased, 9/ on similar terms, by its owners (ethnic Fijian extended family
groups). However, leasing of native land has been centralized and managed for
over 40 years by a public entity, the Native Land Trust Board (NLTB), estab-
lished to protect the rights of native owners, ensure a stable land market,
and to promote appropriate land use. NLTB has done a commendable job and Fiji
is known for its sound management and development of native land. There is an
active market, particularly in the housing sector, in freehold land, NLTB
leaseholds and in leaseholds derived from Crown land leases.
1.17     Urban development has heretofore taken place mainly on Crown and
freehold land, but since these sources of land are finite and almost
exhausted, future urban growth and development will have to take place on
native land. The sound arrangements in place for leasing of native land
should make this possible, but urban planning and land use management capabi-
lities need strengthening to ensure that the special needs of urban areas, and
housing in particular, are addressed.
Government Strategy
1.18     Following the 1987 economic downturn, Government (GOF) adopted an
economic adjustment and recovery program involving two devaluations, large
cuts in public expenditure and other measures which limited the current
account deficit, reestablished financial stability and maintained a trade
surplus. GOF recovery efforts have focussed on assisting the traditional
major sectors of the economy (maintaining a high level of sugar production and
supporting the recovery of the tourism sector) and stimulating new export-
oriented industrial activities, particularly textiles, through a tax-free zone
scheme. In addition to these export-related efforts, GOF is also looking to
an increase in construction sector activity to help stimulate the domestic
economy and generate employment.
1.19     In the housing sector, recognizing the housing shortage, rising
standards and costs and the growing squatter problem, GOF adopted the develop-
ment of sound policies and standards for housing and urban development as a
key objective of its Ninth Development Plan (1986-90) as well as increased
production of housing for all income groups. GOF also recognized shortcomings
in public sector planning, land management, and the performance of housing
finance and development agencies. Although not yet clearly articulated, GOF's
long term objective is a housing finance and development system which ensures
access to affordable housing by all income groups. Government expects the new
policy framework to lay the basis for and support the operation of such a
housing delivery system. The emerging strategy to achieve this objective is
to rationalize public sector housing activities to increase their efficiency
and reduce their burden on the budget while defining appropriate roles for the
public and private sectors in housing development and finance. As a first
step, GOF intends to restructure the activities of its main executing agency,
the Housing Authority. In pursuing its strategy in the housing sector, GOF
requested Bank assistance in formulating a new policy framework, addressing
institutional weaknesses and increasing the supply of housing for lower-income
groups and has already taken action on many Bank recommendations including the
9/ Up to now, native land has been leased primarily for agriculture and
tourism purposes.



- 8 -
adoption of new operational and financial policies by HA and the restructuring
of the rental program.
1.20     In spite of slow investment response to some of its measures, GOF's
economic stabilization and recovery program is sound and is beginning to bear
fruit. New investment in housing could effectively stimulate this process.
In the absence of foreign exchange provided by donors, GOF would have to
resort to deficit financing for this investment. While the investment
proposed under the project is relatively large, it actually represents a
decrease in the level of public sector :investment in housing over the last 10
years (para 1.13). The positive demand stimulation created by the housing
investment and its multiplier effects on associated industries would partly
spill over in increased consumer and inclustrial demand for imports. The
proposed IBRD and ADB loans would initially help finance this increased import
demand in a non-inflationary way. In the long run, foreign exchange earnings
by export-oriented sectors are expected to grow and servicing the foreign debt
should not be a problem.
Bank Strategy
1.21     The Bank's ongoing lending in road rehabilitation (Road Upgrading
Project - Loan No. 2871-FIJ) and teleconmmunications (Third Telecommunications
Project - Loan No. 3074-FIJ), as well as the proposed housing project, support
GOF's economic recovery program by providing or improving key infrastructure
and services needed by the productive sectors and by generating employment and
investment. In addition to providing housing for lower income households, the
proposed housing investment would generate employment by stimulating the con-
struction sector as well as related industries (building materials, home
furnishings, etc.) 10/   The housing wou.ld be targeted to the areas where
industry is or will likely be located and to the workforce required by
industry. A better housed workforce near sources of employment should lead to
increased productivity. Detailed analysis of Fiji's economy, balance of
payments and creditworthiness situation as well as GOF's recovery program are
found in the Country Economic Memorandum (Report No.7724-FIJ).
1.22     As this is the first Bank operation in the sector, Bank assistance
should focus on rectifying institutional, technical and financial problems as
well as formulating the sound policy framework required for future develop-
ment. Once appropriate design standards have been successfully employed in
the public sector housing program to the benefit of lower income households
and sector institutions, particularly the Housing Authority, are operating on
a technically and financially viable basis, the focus of future Bank
assistance should broaden. Longer range objectives should include enhanced
private sector invo:Lvement in housing development and/or finance, improved
financial intermediation for housing and integration of housing finance in the
financial sector.
10/ According to HA estimates, project-financed housing construction alone
would create almost 2,000 jobs and civil works would add more, although
the latter is difficult to quantify. HA estimates the employment
multiplier for related industries at between 2 and 3 times the direct
employment.



II. SECTOR INSTITUTIONS 11/
A. Housing Authority
Legal Basis and Objectives
2.1      The Housing Authority (HA) is a statutory body of the Government of
Fiji established by the Housing Act of 1955 and is responsible to the Ministry
of Housing and Urban Development (MHUD). The Authority assists middle and
lower-income citizens obtain adequate housing by producing and selling
serviced sites, originating and servicing residential mortgages 12/ and
administering GOF's rental housing and village loan programs.
Management and Organizational Structure
2.2      HA is managed by a Chief Executive who reports to the Board.  In
1988, HA employed about 300 staff at an annual cost of F$2.13 million for
salaries and benefits, or F$7,100 per employee on average. Until mid-1988, HA
was organized into four departments: Authority Secretary, responsible for
planning legal, personnel and administrative functions; Housing and
Development, responsible for land development and rental unit construction;
Estates Administration, responsible for marketing of HA for sale production,
management of the rental program, and origination and servicing of mortgages;
and Finance, responsible for accounting, treasury, budget and internal audit
functions. While appearing logical, this organizational structure fostered a
number of anomalies and inefficiencies, such as overly centralized and com-
partmentalized production and lack of distinction between rental and sale
properties. Organizational weaknesses were exacerbated by weak management and
inadequate accounting and information systems.
Operational Performance
2.3      HA began operations in 1958 with purchase and home improvement loans
to lower income workers and a small program of construction of new homes for
sale to lower income workers. In 1964, the GOF-subsidized Rental Housing
Program was established in order to assist lower income workers who tempora-
rily could not afford to own their own home. The production and sale of
serviced sites began in 1971. By the end of 1987, HA had produced about 8,300
serviced sites and 1,800 rental flats and homes, and provided finance for some
7,000 additional mortgages. Over 17,000 families have benefited from HA
programs--or about 34Z of the urban population in 1986. However, as indicated
in para 1.8 in the last several years HA beneficiaries were increasingly
limited to the upper range of HA's target income group.
Institutional Performance
2.4      The Authority was experiencing serious financial problems at the end
of 1987 after years of increasing net losses and its capital base had been

heavily eroded. Multiple problems produced these continuing losses,
including: costly rental housing policies, 13/ negative lending spreads, high
administrative costs, and high mortgage lending arrears. 14/   In addition to
its financial difficulties, HA lacked many of the capabilities needed by a
housing development and financing institution to perform effectively and
efficiently, including: appropriate accounting policies and practices; perma-
nent staff in key managerial and technical posts; appropriate financial,
lending and operating policies; an organizational structure that fostered a
coordinated production effort; firm central direction and coordination in
planning and operations; integrated and accurate financial and management
information systems and reports. 15/
Fundamental Problems
2.5      The political and economic problems that arose in Fiji in 1987
exacerbated the Authority's financial and institutional difficulties but were
not their sole cause. Underlying weaknesses can be found in HA's authorizing
legislation and in the policy framework governing HA operations. Since its
inception, HA has been faced with an cperational paradox: to provide high-
standard low-income housing as an independent statutory body with financial
accountability but without access to sufficient fiscal subsidies to pay
associated costs and debts. Under such circumstances, erosion of HA financial
and technical heaLth was inevitable. The political and economic problems of
1987 accentuated these problems and made evident to GOF the need for funda-
mental change.
Revitalization Plan
2.6      Through a collaborative effort of the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank i(ADB) and UNDP/Habitat staff and consultants working with GOF
and HA officials, a plan 16/ for the comprehensive restructuring of
Government's housing program was designed with the objective of providing
adequate housing to lower-income households in a manner satisfying and
affordable to both recipients of housing assistance and the GOF budget.
2.7      The plan includes:  the redesign of the policy regime governing the
work of HA; separation of the rental housing program from the accounts of HA,
a redesign of HA's organizational, planning and operational format, the intro-
duction of more effective concepts and techniques to produce affordable
13/ GOF subsidies to HA for rental program operating losses effectively
ended in 1986 but HA was expected to continue producing and operating
rental housing on the mistaken assumption that other HA operations
would generate offsetting surpluses.

problems.

Directors in July 1988 and endorsed by the GOF Cabinet in November 1988

housing for lower-income households, and a restructuring of finances and
financial management policies and operations. Much of this plan has been
completed or initiated. The remainder will be completed during the course of
project implementation. Grant funds provided by the Government of Japan
(beginning April 1989) and ADB (beginning early 1990), are providing consul-
tant services to strengthen HA's institutional capabilities.
2.8      Details of the HA Revitalization Plan and its progress are found in
Chapter IV (para. 4.11) and in Annex 2. The main points of the plan can be
summarized as follows:
(a) Policy Framework - a new HA Policy Statement, shown in Annex 3, has
been adopted by the HA Board and endorsed by the Cabinet (November
1988); it provides an appropriate basis for financially viable HA
operations;
(b) Organizational Structure and Key Managerial Appointments - the HA
Board has adopted a revised organizational structure (Annex 1,
Appendix B) and has filled all but two senior management positions
with competent and experienced local staff; the two unfilled posts-
-the corporate planning and EDP managers--have been filled by
external recruitment utilizing the Japanese grant;
(c) Housing Production - HA has introduced a computerized project design
and costing model and has adopted appropriate standards, specifically
approved by GOF in September 1988, to plan and design the project for
the benefit of lower income households; a project management approach
has also been adopted to ensure that affordable housing is produced
on a timely basis; these innovations will be supported by project-
financed technical assistance;
(d) Data Processing and Management Information - HA's obsolete computer
system is to be replaced and its accounting and financial information
systems modernized; project-financed technical assistance will direct
and support this effort;
(e) Corporate Planning - HA has introduced a financial planning and
projections model along with corporate planning techniques; these
tools will be further developed and institutionalized by project-
financed technical assistance.
(f) Financial Restructuring - With GOF assistance, HA acted vigorously in
1988 to identify and remedy its financial problems: financing was
arranged to meet short-term cash flow requirements, debt service was
brought up to date, long-term financing for current production was
obtained, new mortgage finance policies ensuring an adequate lending
spread and interest rate risk coverage were adopted, and strong
action was taken to improve mortgage loan collection performance; and
(g) Restructuring of Rental Program - GOF approved (November 1988) a
series of steps (see Rental Restructuring Plan in Annex 4) to
restructure the public sector rental program beginning with the
transfer of the program from HA to a new body, the Public Rental



- 12 -
Board (PRBI), and including the sale of about 40Z of the rental units
to tenants; (rehabilitation costs to be financed by the project) and
introduction of economic rents; the restructuring plan is being
supported by technical assistance financed by the Japanese grant; the
PRB Policy, Statement, action plan and financial projections are
contained in Annex 5.
B. Ministry of Housing and Urban Development
2.9      The Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (MHUD) is responsible
for formulating and implementing policies for urban planning and land use,
local government, aLnd housing. Thirteen statutory bodies are responsible to
MHUD:  Fiji's incorporated cities (2) and towns (8); the Housing Authority;
the National Trust for Fiji (preservation of historical buildings, sites,
flora and fauna); and the Suva Fire Brigade. MHUD is a small ministry
consisting of 45 established positions and an annual operating budget of about
F$850,700 (1988). It is administered by a Permanent Secretary who reports to
the Minister. Twenty-eight of the 45 established posts are assigned to the
Department of Town and Country Planning (TCPD).
2.10     MHUD has limited capacity to carry out its responsibilities for the
development and implementation of housing and urban development policies.
There is no specialized policy analysis and development staff. Policy matters
are handled by the Permanent Secretary on an ad hoc basis. The development of
appropriate policies in the urban sector was made a key objective of the
current development plan. GOF's recognition of the need for assistance in
developing these policies was a key factor behind the request for Bank assis-
tance for the project. The Bank helped arrange for UNDP and UN Center for
Human Settlements assistance for development of the new policy framework.
This assistance (underway since June 1989) is detailed in para. 3.4(a'.
C. Town and Country Planning Department
2.11     TCPD formulates planning and land use standards, prepares town plans,
reviews and approves subdivision and building requests, and processes requests
for planning changes and exemptions. It plays an important role in guiding
the country's urban development; other government institutions such as the
HA, Public Works Department, Ministry of Lands and NLTB as well as the private
sector rely on TCPD's work. TCPD is re,ceiving assistance from bilateral
donors (Australia and Japan) to further strengthen its institutional capabili-
ties in forward planning, information management and environmental planning.
ADB is providing grant financing (approved December 1989) for additional tech-
nical assistance needed to strengthen tlhe monitoring of urban growth and the
development of standards for land use. Details are provided in para. 3.4(b).
D. The Native Land Trust Board
2.12     The Native Land Trust Board (NLTB) is a statutory body responsible
for the administration of all native lands on behalf of the native owners.
Native lands constitute about 83Z of the country's total land resource. NLTB
assists in making native land available for development and arranges and
administers leases on such land ensurinlg that: rents and fees are paid when
due, rent reassessments are made on a timely basis, tenants and owners fulfill



- 13 -
the terms of their leases, and native owners are promptly, accurately and
efficiently paid monies owed them.
2.13     NLTB is governed by a Board of Directors and run by a General
Manager. It employs about 200 staff and has an annual budget of about
F$4 million. Its principal source of income is commissions on the leases it
arranges and administers. The commission schedule is fixed by law and
reflects GOF's desire to limit fee levels for NLTB services in order to encou-
rage native land owners to continue making land available through NLTB.
2.14     NLTB plays an important role in economic and social development,
including urban development and housing through its management of the bulk of
the country's land resources. It has a reputation for competence in its work
and management and has underway a sophisticated, computerized land information
system which will eventually provide accurate land data for the entire
country. An area in need of strengthening within NLTB is land use planning
for which it shares responsibility with TCPD. Activities of the two agencies
are complementary with TCPD focussing on standards and estimation of land
requirements for development while NLTB concentrates on ensuring adequate
supply of land for the required uses where development will take place.  NLTB
did work in this area in the past (1980) but the results are outdated and NLTB
now realizes that land use planning activities should be ongoing to adjust to
changing conditions and demands. NLTB will establish a land use planning unit
in 1990. Terms of reference have been prepared for the required expert assis-
tance to guide and train in-house staff and for external training and specia-
lized computer equipment to permit use of NLTB's existing system for land use
planning purposes. Details are provided in para. 3.4(b). Coordination of
this assistance will be required with the complementary assistance to be
provided to TCPD.

III. THE PROJECT
3.1      The project is the result of GOF requests to UNDP for assistance in
sector policy formulation and to the Ban.k for financing of low income housing.
UNDP and the UN Center for Human Settlements financed the preparation of most
elements of the project. The Asian Development Bank also contributed to
project preparation.
3.2      The project is intended to address the first phase of GOF and Bank
sector strategy and attempting more in this first effort in the sector would
be overly ambitious. Therefore, project objectives are limited to resolving
the key issues of this phase of the strategy: (a) getting the dominant sector
institution (HA) on a sound operational and financial footing on to avoid the
serious damage to the housing and financial sectors its collapse would cause,
while (b) developing the sector policy base needed for later elements of the
strategy and (c) redirecting housing production to neglected lower income
households. The scope of the project, particularly its physical components,
has been conservatively dimensioned to fit the reduced production capacity of
an institution restructuring its programs and processes as well as demand
estimates based on current economic conditions.
A. Objectives and Description
Objectives
3.3      The objectives of the project are:
(a) improved housing and urbanization policies for the sector as a
whole and dievelopment standards appropriate to the needs and means
of the lower-income groups;
(b)  strengthened sector institutions; and
(c) increased provision of affordable housing to lower-income groups.
Project Description
3.4      The project comprises the following components:
(a) Policy Development
(i)  improvement in urban policy framework for the Ministry of
Housing and Urban Development through technical assistance,
equipment purchase, training and studies; a total of 26 person-
months of technical assistance would be provided to MHUD to
draft new housing and urbanization policies; provision would be
made for computer equipment and software purchase and for train-
ing of key personnel (details of this component, as well as
other policy development and institutional strengthening compo-
nents have been agreed and are available in the Project File
[Annex 6]);



- 15 -
(ii)  operationalization of urban policies for MHUD through technical
assistance and studies; a total of 24 person-months of technical
assistance and studies would be provided to develop operational
approaches for the housing and urbanization policy framework;
studies to guide policy implementation would be undertaken in
critical areas such as the further integration of housing
finance into the financial sector, the enhancement of the role
of the private sector in land and housing development and mort-
gage finance; a provision of 12 person-months of short-term
technical assistance would also be made to cover unforeseen
needs that arise during the course of project implementation.
(b) Institutional Strengthening
(i) improvement of the urban planning and standards development
capability for the Town and Country Planning Department through
technical assistance and training; a total of 18 person-months
of technical assistance would be provided to help TCPD undertake
a study of urban growth and establish a data base and to review
and revise planning and land development standards;
(ii)  improvement of the land use planning capability of the Native
Land Trust Board through technical assistance, training and
equipment purchase; a land use planning and housing expert would
be provided to NLTB for a period of 36 person-months to help
establish a land use unit to plan the delivery of native land
for urban development, especially housing; in-house seminars and
workshops and overseas training of urban and land use planners;
computer equipment;
(iii)  improvement in operations management (physical planning, project
management, procurement) and financial management (corporate
planning, accounting, data processing) for HA through technical
assistance, training and equipment purchase; a total of 122
person-months of technical assistance would be provided to help
HA improve its operations and finance and carry out the project;
provision would be made for in-house training (seminars and
workshops) and study tours of similar institutions in other
countries in the region; provision would also be made for the
purchase of a mainframe computer system and necessary software
to replace the existing obsolete system as well as other
computer requirements;
(iv) improvement in the operations (restructuring, rehabilitation,
sale, rent collections, accounting) of the public rental housing
program for the Public Rental Board (PRB) through technical
assistance and equipment; a rental management/restructuring
expert would be provided for 12 months as well as provision for
initiating the PRB accounts and an audit of the rental program
handover arrangements for HA to PRB; provision would also be
made for the purchase of two microcomputers.

(c) Land Development and Housing
(i) land development - a total of 3,320 new plots would be
developed, of which 2,760 would be on 11 sites (site descrip-
tions are in Annex 7) in the Suva/Nausori area and Lautoka and
560 plots on sites to be identified in response to demand; plot
size would range from 203-688 square meters with 75% of plots
less than 375 square meters and 40% less than 275 square meters;
infrastructure would include water, sewer and electrical
networks 17/ and roads of 6-12 meter width with gravel
(conditions permitting) o,r bitumen surfacing; plot cost would
range from F$2,640 to F$14,860 averaging F$4,830 and would be
affordable (including house costs noted below) from the 13th to
the 70th percentiles of the national urban income distribution;
HA loans would cover a maximum of 80Z of total plot cost and
purchasers would provide minimum 20% downpayments; land for
project sites has already been acquired by HA with the exception
of the sites to be identiified for the 560 additional plots;
(ii) house construction finance: new plots - houses costing an
average of F$4,060 would be constructed on the 3,320 new plots
by the purchasers with loans (maximum 80Z financing) averaging
F$3,200 per house (ranging from F$805 to F$10,480) and the
balance of financing coming from the purchasers' minimum down-
payments; house designs prepared by HA to be provided to plot
purchases are based on an incremental development approach (see
illustrative drawings in Annex 9); temporary structures allowing
plot occupancy during house development would also be permitted;
with the average house cost over 50% of the plots are affordable
below the 40th percentile and with cheapest house option nearly
40% of the plots are affordable below the 25th percentile;
(iii) house construction finance: existing plots - houses costing an
average of F$10,875 (maximum cost F$12,000) would be constructed
on some 2,000 existing plots (already developed by HA) by
purchasers with loans providing a maximum of 80% of house cost
and the balance of financing coming from the purchasers' minimum
20% downpayments; this component would assist HA to reduce the
loan commitment overhang on the 2,600 plots sold but without
houses because of lack of (HA) mortgage finance; house designs
prepared for new plots would also be available;
(iv) rental rehabilitation - repair and/or upgrading of an estimated
760 existing rental units prior to sale to sitting tenants or
other buyers; rehabilitation costs would range F$250-1,000 and
average F$780.
17/ Individual connections to water, sewer and electrical networks are the
responsibility of the plot purchaser. The cost of these connections
has been included in the affordability analysis for each site.

B. Project Cost, Financing and Onlending
Project Cost
3.5       Total project cost is summarized in Table 3.1 below.  Cost details
are found in Annex 8. Base costs are as of end December 1989 and are based on
detailed engineering for two sites and preliminary engineering for other
sites. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at 37Z of total project cost
(432 of total financing required). Computer equipment and technical assis-
tance cost estimates assume exemption from taxes and duties. On this basis,
taxes are estimated to be less than 1X of total project cost. Price contin-
gencies are based on projected domestic price increases of 7Z for 1990 and 4%
for subsequent years and projected price increases on foreign exchange costs
of 4.9% for 1990-95. Physical contingencies have been estimated at 10% on
civil works and have not been applied to house construction on existing plots
or on land already acquired, design and supervision and technical assistance
components. Design and supervision have been estimated at 7.5% on civil works
and house construction.
3.6       Interest during construction (IDC) has been calculated on all borrow-
ing of the Housing Authority, a financially autonomous entity, including the
proposed Bank loan, and is shown separately in the summary cost table below as
additional financing required. IDC on the Bank loan is based on projected
disbursements over the implementation period of the project at the proposed
onlending rate from GOF to HA (8.5% currently). The estimated foreign cost
component of IDC, based on the Bank lending rate of 7.75Z currently in effect,
is also shown in the table below.

3.7      As shown in Table 3.1 above, total financing required is US$51.3
million, which includes IDC of US$10.6 million (US$6.7 million on the proposed
Bank loan). Bank financing of IDC is not warranted because of recent actions
to improve past HA cash flow problems and HA's projected healthy cash flow
during the period of the project (see paras. 4.11-4.13). Therefore, HA would
finance IDC. Table 3.2 below summarizes project financing.
Financing Plan
3.8      The proposed loan of US$16.2 million would cover about 34Z of the
total financing required (US$47.9 million) excluding IDC accruing to loans
other than the Bank Loan. ADB would finance US$10.1 million including
technical assistance grants of US$542,000 or 20Z of total financing (25Z of
total project cost excluding IDC). ADB cofinancing which would be parallel
financing and limited to certain project sites and technical assistance
components, was approved by the ADB Board in December 1989. Japanese Grant 18/
financing of V 150 million (US$1.0 million at US$1 = Y 139 as of September 15,
1989) is being disbursed following signature of the grant agreement in
December 1988. UNDP financing is also effective. HA's share of US$16.2
million (US$6.1 million less IDC) would cover 32Z of financing requirements
(15Z of total project costs less IDC) would be funded primarily from HA's own
funds and by local borrowing, mostly from the Fiji National Provident Fund
(FNPF). The Public Rental Board would finance a small share of the costs of
the rental rehabilitation component (US$88,100) representing less than 1X of
total cost. The balance of project financing, US$7.4 million or 14Z of total
financing (or 18Z of total cost excluding IDC, would come from downpayments by
HA plot purchasers and mortgage loan borrowers. These downpayments would come
primarily from the individual FNPF pension balances accumulated by the project
beneficiaries. IBRD would not finance land acquisition costs, any existing
value in the rental rehabilitation component or taxes and import duties.
18/ The Government of Japan has asked the Bank, under a grant agreement of
June 3, 1987, to administer grant funds to support Bank-financed
projects. GOJ and the Bank subsequently agreed to allocate V 150
million from these funds to finance part of the technical assistance
requirements of this project. The grant agreement between the Bank and
GOF was signed on December 7, 1988. The funds are being applied to the
technical assistance requirements of HA.

Onlending Terms
3.9       IBRD financing would be in the form of a loan to Government for 17
years (five years grace) at the IBRD variable interest rate (currently 7.75Z).
IBRD financing for technical assistance and equipment components would be
passed on By GOF to HA, TCPD and NLTB as grants as would the IBRD financing
for the rehabilitation of rental units by PRB. IBRD financing for civil works
and house construction would be onlent to HA, under a subsidiary loan
agreement acceptable to the Bank, for 17 years, including 5 years grace, at a
variable rate, 3Z below the mid-point in the range of mortgage lending rates
charged by financial institutions in Fiji. It was agreed at loan negotiations
that the mid-point rate would be determined by the Reserve Bank of Fiji on
September 30 each year by dividing by two the sum of the highest and lowest
mortgage interest rates in the financial sector. For this purpose, a list of
financial institutions has been agreed with GOF and is contained in the
Minutes of Negotiations. As of late 1989 this calculation would result in an
onlending rate to HA of 8.5Z. This indirect onlending rate methodology is
necessary because of the absence of an appropriate market reference rate for
term finance. It was decided to use mortgage lending rates, which are market-
determined, as the starting point and subtract a reasonable spread (3Z) for
this kind of lending to arrive at a proxy reference rate. The objective of
this onlending approach is to ensure that the onlending rate to HA remains
aligned to market rates. The difference between the onlending rate and the
IBRD rate to GOF (which would be 0.75Z currently) will compensate GOF for its



- 20 -
handling of the loan. This GOF onlendirng spread will also be variable since
the IBRD rate and the mortgage midpoint rate will vary independently. This
onlending arrangemenLt will be reviewed by the Bank, ADB and GOF, on the basis
of the results of a housing sector domestic resource mobilization study,
separately financed by ADB, which is expected to be completed by June 1990.
Signature of the sulbsidiary agreement between GOF and HA is a condition of
effectiveness.  Government would bear the foreign exchange risk on the IBRD
loan because (a) the risks arising from GOF's desire to stimulate the economy
through investment in the housing sector should be borne by GOF, (b) HA does
not earn foreign exchange and cannot hedge the risk, and (c) forward cover is
unavailable in Fiji. This is consistent with GOF's economic recovery program
and its assessment by the Bank (paras. 1.18-1.20). UNDP and Japan Fund
financing (already approved and effective) are in grant form.
3.10     HA would onlend to the final beneficiaries at its variable mortgage
lending rate (currently 11.5%) which would be reviewed annually according to
the principles set forth in the HA Policy Statement (Annex 3, para. 17). This
would currently allow HA a lending spread of 3Z which is considered adequate
to cover its operating costs. This spread would likewise be variable.19/ The
current mortgage lending rate is positive (average domestic inflation over the
last several years was 4.7Z). HA rates during the project are expected to
remain positive since HA's cost of funds and lending spread can be expected to
reflect domestic inflation, which is projected to average 4.9X during the
project. Terms of ADB financing (approved December 21, 1989) to GOF are
standard, although UJS$542,000 of the ADB financing is a technical assistance
grant. Onlending terms on ADB financing will be the same as for IBRD
financing except that repayment will be over 20 years.
C. Implementation
3.11     The project: is expected to take 6 years to complete (1990-95) (see
Table A for project implementation schedule). With the exception of the
policy development and institutional strengthening components which would be
the responsibility of MHUD, TCPD, PRB and NLTB, and the rental restructuring
component under PRB, HA would implement the project. Implementation of land
development and housing components would follow current GOF and HA procedures,
as modified to comply with Bank guidelines. Improvements suggested by the
Bank during project preparation in the planning, design, costing, pricing, and
mortgage financing of HA projects have already been adopted by HA (and reflec-
ted in its Policy Statement - Annex 3). Improvement to HA's contract documen-
tation and bidding procedures (paras. 3.17 and 3.19) to comply with Bank
guidelines (including drafting of bid documents satisfactory to the Bank), for
which technical assistance financed by the Japanese grant is being provided,
is a condition of ef-fectiveness. With the exception of sites to be identified
and developed in response to demand, all sites have been fully acquired by HA.
No civil works or house construction would be undertaken directly by HA.
Local or international contractors acceptable to the Bank (see below) would be
engaged by HA for civil works. Individual plot purchasers would borrow from
HA for house construction and would themselves engage small contractors for
this purpose. Before proceeding on sites to be developed in response to
19/ A means of controlling HA operating expenses would be necessary to
avoid inefficiencies which might be tolerated by HA's rate setting
procedures (para. 4.13)



- 21 -
demand, HA would submit the site selection and planning criteria, design
standards and beneficiary selection criteria to the Bank for review and
approval (criteria and standards for already identified and acquired sites are
contained in Annex 9). This is a condition of disbursement for these
components. The provision of necessary offsite water, sewer and electrical
infrastructure to serve each project site has been programmed and budgeted by
the relevant authorities (PWD and Fiji Electricity Authority). Assurances
were received at negotiations that this infrastructure will be provided when
required.
3.12     To ensure that its capacities are not overburdened, HA would not
undertake land development and mortgage lending other than project-financed
activities during the project period without the prior agreement of the Bank.
To this effect, HA's program and budget for the following year would be
reviewed with the Bank every year. This was confirmed at negotiations. HA's
projected program for the project period (See Annex 10) was confirmed at
negotiations along with the key points of the Revitalization Plan, the Policy
Statement and HA's project implementation responsibilities, including HA
support services to PRB. Implementation of the HA Revitalization Plan is
already underway and the Japanese grant is financing key technical assistance
to support the plan. Appointment by HA of key Japanese grant-financed experts
(Corporate Planner, EDP Manager, Accounting Policy/Systems Adviser and Project
Management Adviser) has been made.
3.13     PRB, with the aid of HA support services and project-financed techni-
cal assistance, would implement the rental restructuring component. The GOF
Cabinet approved the creation of PRB in November 1988, the decree of
establishment was issued in May 1989 and Cabinet approved the PRB policy
statement in November 1989. The formal creation of PRB, agreement among
concerned parties (HA, PRB, FNPF, MOF, MHUD) on the details of the transfer
from HA to PRB of rental program assets and liabilities and the selection by
PRB of the Japanese grant-financed rental expert, have been accomplished prior
to negotiations. The broad outline of the rental restructuring program was
agreed at negotiations. Completion of the transfer of the rental program from
HA to PRB is a condition of effectiveness. The development of a detailed
program, including the rehabilitation of rental units for sale, is a condition
of disbursement for this component.
3.14     Other project components, for policy development and institutional
strengthening, would be implemented by MHUD, TCPD and NLTB. There would be no
project agreements with these agencies but assurances were received at
negotiations that these components would be implemented according to the
agreed terms of reference and that complementary TCPD and NLTB activities
would be closely coordinated. The UNDP-financed policy development component
has been underway since June 1988. The proposed new housing and urbanization
policies, as well as the planning and design standards to be developed by TCPD
and NLTB, by June 30, 1993 will be reviewed with the Bank before their
submission to GOF for approval.
3.15     The policy formulation component would be followed by Bank-funded
technical assistance, under the direction of MHUD, to operationalize the new
policies. MHUD would engage consultants with qualifications and terms and
conditions of employment acceptable to the Bank to conduct studies designed to
identify and prepare actions and investments which would put the new policies
to work. Formulation of terms of reference acceptable to the Bank for this



- 22 -
consultancy would be accomplished by December 31, 1990. With the exception of
the urban policy operationalization component, terms of reference for all
technical assistance and studies have been agreed and are contained in the
Project File.
Squatters on Project Sites
3.16     HA policy and procedures (Appendix to Annex 9) for dealing with
squatters on land it acquires were reviewed during the course of project
preparation and found satisfactory and in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Review of HA practice indicated that the stated policy is consistently and in
fact generously followed. Squatters are accommodated on site through first
priority access to the developed plots but are required to pay full price for
their plots with H[A financing on the usual terms. They are allowed to retain
existing structures. HA assists squatters unable to afford plots to raise
charitable contributions for plot purchase or to find accommodation elsewhere
and resettle. In practice, few squatters have been unable to purchase plots
on site. Six of the 12 project sites contain squatters involving a total of
70 households (380 people). HA's surveys of the squatters indicate that all
of the households would be able to afford at least the cheapest plot on the
sites they inhabit (para. 5.2).
D. Procurement
Format of Bidding and Contract Documents
3.17     Standard international procurement documents (ICB) will be prepared
using the IBRD-recommended sample formats for civil works, supply of goods,
and consultant services. The mission reviewed with HA the related terms and
conditions of contract and bid evaluation criteria generally applicable to the
nature and type of contracts anticipated under the project. Draft bid
documents (for civil works and goods) and requests for proposal (for
consultant services), will be submitted to the Bank prior to loan
effectiveness. As agreed, the standard FIDIC terms of contract, modified to
suit Fijian conditions, will be adopted for civil works contracts. Since
foreign bidders are not to be excluded Erom participation in local competitive
bidding (LCB), the above-mentioned ICB documents would also serve for LCB,
with only minimal modifications. Both the Bank and ADB have agreed to the use
of the same standard procurement documentation (except where changes are
needed to reflect the specific procurement guidelines of each agency).
Procurement of contracts to be financed by the Bank and ADB under the project
has been designed on a parallel financing basis.
Local and International Competitive Bidding
3.18     Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 3.3 below.  Civil
works contracts exceeding US$750,000 equivalent (about F$l.l million) in value
and goods procurement contracts exceeding US$25,00.0 equivalent (about
F$37,000) in value would be procured through international competitive bidding
in accordance with IBRD guidelines. In the evaluation of ICB contracts for
goods, local manufacturers would be accorded the usual margin of preference
(15Z of the CIF price or customs duties, whichever is lower). Following the
existing practice, contracts for electricity networks and water and sewerage
networks would be directly executed by the Fiji Electricity Authority and PWD,
respectively, on behalf of HA. For contracts valued below the ICB limits,
local competitive bidding acceptable to the Bank would be used (para. 3.19).



- 23 -
The aggregate value of LCB procurement would be limited to US$2.5 million.
For civil works contracts of less than US$10,000, prudent shopping (based on
at least three price quotations) would be permitted with the aggregate value
of such contracts not exceeding US$200,000. For goods contracts of less than
US$25,000, competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank would be
permitted with the aggregate value of such contracts not exceeding US$200,000.
Contractors for all ICB civil works bids would be prequalified in accordance
with agreed evaluation criteria. Consultant services for technical assistance
components to be financed by IBRD would be obtained according to IBRD
guidelines. Table B summarizes civil works and goods contracts to be financed
by IBRD and ADB by land development site.
Review of Procurement Documentation
3.19     All bid and contract documents for works and equipment to be procured
in the first two years of project implementation would be subject to IBRD
prior review and approval. In subsequent years, if IBRD review has indicated
that HA bid documentation procedures are satisfactory, IBRD prior review of
bid documents would only be required for civil works contracts exceeding
US$750,000 equivalent in value and goods contracts exceeding US$50,000 equiva-
lent in value. For all bids, HA would prepare for IBRD review a detailed
report containing bid analyses and recommendation for award.
3.20     A review of current HA contracting practice was undertaken during
appraisal and it was determined that existing bidding and evaluation
procedures need to be streamlined. Technical assistance being provided to HA
under the Japanese grant includes an element to address this need. In addi-
tion, HA would explore the possibility of addressing the cash flow needs of
contractors through the provision of mobilization advances (maximum of 20Z,
secured by bank guarantee) or acceptance of retention bonds in lieu of cash
retentions.

who would engage small private contractors. Rehabilitation of rental units, compris-
ing numerous small improvements would be undertaken by HA under force account.
Note: Figures in the Parentheses are the respective amounts financed by the Bank or
cofinancers as indicated.
E. Disbursements
3.21      The IBRD loan would be disbursed on the following basis:
(a)  60Z of total expenditure for civil works for the residential land
development component;
(b)  60% of total HA disbursements for house construction for the new plot
and existing plot house construction components; and
(c)  100Z of foreign expenditures an.d 65Z of local expenditures for
materials and equipment; and
(d)  100X of total expenditures for technical assistance and studies.
3.22      Disbursement would be made against Statement of Expenditure  (SOE) for
(a) subloans for housing construction, and (b) eligible expenditures relating
to contracts valued under US$50,000 equivalent. Supporting documentation for
these would be retained by HA and made available for review by the Bank during
supervision.  All other disbursements would be made against normal documenta-
tion submitted to the Bank.



- 25 -
3.23     In order to expedite project execution, and should HA so require, a
Special Account would be opened in the central bank (or any commercial bank
acceptable to the Bank) with an initial deposit of US$0.4 million, sufficient
to cover project expenditures for a four month period. These funds would be
used to reimburse HA for the Bank's share of the project cost, as well as to
effect in an expedient manner direct payments in foreign currency.
3.24     The IBRD loan would be committed over a period of six years (1990-95)
and fully disbursed by June 30, 1996. This follows the regional disbursement
profile for urban projects and the profile for all sectors for Fiji. The
conditions of disbursement (para 3.13) would apply to the rental rehabilita-
tion and to the (presently unidentified) future site development components.
F. Accounts and Audit
3.25     HA and PRB would send to the Bank for review within 9 months of the
end of each financial year their audited statements of their full accounts,
including separate project accounts. All audits would follow terms of
reference agreed with the Bank and would be conducted by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank. The auditors would also audit the Special Account and
provide a separate opinion on disbursements made under SOE procedures. MHUD
would arrange for the annual audit of the project accounts of activities under
its control for review by the Bank. NLTB would cause its auditors to provide
a separate audit and opinion of its project accounts for review by the Bank.
MHUD and NLTB audit reports would also be submitted to the Bank within 9
months after the end of each agency's financial year. Accounting and audit
arrangements for components financed by the Japanese grant are described in
the grant agreement signed by the Bank and GOF in December 1988.
G. Operations and Maintenance
3.26     Operations and maintenance of project-financed infrastructure would
closely follow existing practice in Fiji except that the formal handover of
these facilities to responsible authorities would be made in a more timely
manner than at present. Roads, water and sewerage systems would be operated
and maintained by the Public Works Department (PWD) through its existing net-
work of offices (in this case, PWD offices in Suva, Nausori and Lautoka). The
electrical network would be the responsibility of the Fiji Electricity
Authority. Garbage collection in project areas would be the responsibility of
concerned local authorities (e.g. Lautoka City Council for Tavakubu and Suva
Rural Local Authority for Kalabo). However, special arrangements would have
to be made for garbage collection for the Davuilevu and Naulu sites in the
Nausori Rural Local Authority area which does not yet have organized public
refuse removal and lacks a suitable landfill site. A Japanese government
funded study is addressing this problem in the context of improving solid
waste management in the Suva metropolitan area. In the interim, the Ministry
of Health has indicated that on site disposal of garbage through a combination
of composting and burning is permissible. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that HA would promptly hand over project infrastructure
facilities to the responsible O&M agencies after completion of construction
and satisfactory testing and that these agencies would accept the completed
facilities. This is a loan covenant.

IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. HOUSING AUT'HORITY FINANCES
Introduction
4.1      In pursuing its objective of providing housing for low and middle
income households, HA develops and provides mortgage finance for housing for
sale and develops and retains ownership of housing for rent. HA also provides
for rural housing needs through a small (average 9% of total HA development
operations) village loan scheme which is secured by liens on borrowing
villages' NLTB land rental income or crop proceeds. HA therefore combines the
roles of housing ideveloper, mortgage finance institution and owner/operator of
social welfare rental housing. It is also permitted to finance the purchase,
extension or improvement of existing housing and to undertake other activities
(such as the development and sale/lease of land for commercial, industrial or
community purposes) which would contribute to its housing efforts. HA has no
banking functions and does not take deposits (other than downpayments from
prospective homebuyers).  All civil works and house construction are
undertaken by private firms under contract to HA or the beneficiary households
themselves.
4.2      HA received its initial capitalization in the form of GOF grants of
small amounts of cash as well as CrownL land at nominal rents which it then
developed and sold, retaining the profits as capital.  Periodic GOF capital
grants in cash and land continued until 1983 when HA's capitalization reached
its 1988 level of F$11.2 million. HA's early operations, involving the
development and sale of houses to first-time lower income home buyers, were
financed by GOF's capital grants supplemented by GOF loans. Beginning 1966,
HA began borrowin,g from a variety of sources (including insurance companies,
commercial banks and other statutory bodies) on market terms. Starting in
1974, FNPF became HA's exclusive source of long term borrowing. HA began
developing and managing rental housing in 1964 and it was a deeply subsidized
program from the outset, intended to serve those who could not afford HA's
sale housing.
4.3      In its 31 years of operations, HA has developed approximately 17,000
residential and 500 commercial/industrial plots for sale, and has made almost
8,000 mortgage loans for housing and 7,800 loans for plot purchase only. In
addition, HA has developed more than 1,800 rental units of which 1,713 remain
(the balance were sold or demolished for redevelopment).
4.4      Until July 1988 (when the HA Board adopted a new policy statement),
HA's mortgage loan terms involved a maximum loan amount of F$20,000, minimum
downpayment of 5Z, repayment periods of 5-30 years at interest rates of 9.5Z
to 11.5Z (some of the older loans in the HA portfolio carried rates as low as
5%) and repayments subject to a maximum of 33% of gross income of the appli-
cant. For the rental program, tenants are obliged to pay 15Z of gross income
or economic rent whichever is lower with the difference to be paid (in
principle) by GOF.



- 27 -
Past Performance
4.5      HA began the period reviewed in detail (1983-88) with a relatively
sound balance sheet (financial statements showing past HA financial perfor-
mance and projected future performance are found in Annex 10). The long-term
debt/equity ratio was 4.6:1 and the current ratio 3.5:1. However operations
were generating losses (which began before 1980) arising from the rental
program (where rental income was only a fraction of operating costs), inade-
quate mortgage lending spreads (which were at times negative), poor pricing of
sale housing (which often did not reflect full costs) and poor loan management
(resulting in lost interest income and higher than necessary interest expense
from additional borrowing to meet cash needs). In 1983, operating losses
amounted to F$749,000 or nearly 12% of gross income. GOF subsidies and other
adjustments reduced the net loss to F$118,000 (2% of gross income) and, when
added to previous years losses, the accumulated deficit for 1983 was F$2.1
million or nearly 14% of total equity.
4.6      During the period, HA grew at a moderate pace with total assets
increasing at an average annual rate of 6.5% from F$78.7 million to F$101.2
million in 1987 then declining slightly to F$100.1 million in 1988. The mort-
gage loan portfolio increased at an average rate of 7.5% from F$44.6 million
to F$63.4 million in 1988. Fixed assets (rental housing and HA buildings,
work in progress) grew from F$21.6 million in 1983 to F$34.7 million in 1988
and ranged from 27% of total assets at the beginning of the period to 35Z in
1988. Borrowing also increased moderately at an average annual rate of 9.7Z
to F$95.9 million in 1988. The higher rate of growth in borrowing compared to
that in the loan portfolio reflects HA's cash flow problems. All long-term
borrowing during the period was from FNPF which held 93Z of HA debt in 1983
and 92% in 1988.
4.7      Operating losses worsened during the period, increasing from 5.8% of
gross income (net of subsidy) in 1984 to 62% in 1988. The financial and
management weaknesses noted above which generated the losses were exacerbated
by the termination of GOF subsidies in 1985 and steadily increasing arrears in
the rental and mortgage loan programs. These repeated losses caused a steady
deterioration in the balance sheet with accumulated deficits reaching F$13.6
million in 1988 and having eroded nearly 88Z of total equity in 1988. The
erosion of HA's capital and increased borrowing led to an increase in the
long-term debt/equity ratio to 47:1 in 1988. The current ratio showed steady
deterioration until 1988 when it improved to 1.25:1.
4.8      HA's financial position in late-1989 was extremely poor.  Its opera-
tions are suffering from:
(a) a deeply subsidized rental program for which HA no longer receives
offsetting GOF grants;
(b) a negative interest rate spread (average cost of funds of 10.6%
versus average interest earned of 10.1%);
(c) high arrears in the mortgage loan portfolio as of mid-1989 HA's
records showed that of its 13,928 loan accounts 7,186 (52%) were in
arrears and that accumulated arrears (F$9 million) had reached 14% of
total portfolio; furthermore approximately 30% of the accounts in
arrears were aged 18 months or more; however, the inadequate account-



- 28 -
ing and computer systems significantly overstate 20/ the arrears
position (by as much as 40Z); an accurate picture will only come with
the new computer and accounting systems to be put in place under the
project; and
(d) a negative cash flow (cash deficit of F$7.2 million for 1988)
produced by a combination of the above factors.
4.9      As a result, HA was unable to meet its FNPF debt service obligations
for several months in 1988 and had to seek GOF assistance in guaranteeing
(a) the repayment of a F$1 million increase in its commercial bank overdraft
and (b) underwriting the first issue (F$4.0 million) of HA promissory notes
(taking advantage of unusually low short-term interest rates). This enabled
HA to meet its short-term cash requirements and return to a current position
on its debts.
4.10     If the above situation were allowed to continue, HA would be bankrupt
by 1991.
HA Revitalization ]?lan
4.11     Recognizing that the collapse of HA would not only damage its housing
program but would also have serious implications for the financial sector
(especially FNPF), GOF agreed to an HA revitalization plan with the following
components:
(a) emergency actions to assist HA. t.J resolve its cash flow crisis
comprising approval of an increase in HA's mortgage lending rates to
variable rates (para. 3.10) of 10Z (for existing loans previously
5-9.5Z) and 12% (for new loans and existing loans previously at
10-11.5Z), guarantee of an increase in HA's commercial bank
overdraft, underwriting of an issue of HA promissory notes and public
announcements by Government officials supporting HA's efforts to
collect reental and mortgage loan arrears; this action was completed
in June and July 1988 (GOF support for arrears collection is
continuing);
(b)  filling of key HA management vacancies including the post of Chief
Executive; this action was completed in September-October 1988;
(c) a capital contribution to HA of F$1 million (in the form of the
repayment of the increase in HA's commercial bank overdraft); the F$
1 million payment was made by GOF in April 1989;
(d)  elimination of water reticulation and land subsidies in the housing
for sale program; this has been agreed for project sites (with the
adoption and approval of the H[A Policy Statement); issues of the
pricing of HA products and subsidies in the sector as a whole would
be addressed under the policy formulation component of the project
(para. 3.4 (b));
20/ Due to late and/or inaccurate posting of payments to individual ledger
accounts.



- 29 -
(e) approval of a new HA Policy Statement which makes a number of organi-
zational, operational and financial changes designed to make HA
financially viable (Annex 3); this was adopted by the HA Board in
July 1988 and approved by Cabinet in November 1988;
(f) strengthening of the HA Board by adding representatives of the finan-
cial sector; this action was accomplished in December 1988;
(g) consideration of changes to the Housing Act to correct ambiguities
regarding the role and operations of HA; MHUD plans to present
Housing Act revisions to Cabinet during the project; and
(h) restructuring the rental program involving:
(i)  creation of new public body, the Public Rental Board (PRB);
creation of PRB was approved by Cabinet in November 1988 and the
Presidential decree formally establishing it was issued in May
1989 and the PRB policy statement was endorsed by the Cabinet in
November 1989;
(ii)  transfer from HA to PRB of the assets and liabilities of the
rental program; this is a condition of effectiveness;
(iii)  implementation of a program of improvements to the finances,
management and operations of the rental program which would
include:
-    removal of rent controls on public rental housing;
-    progressive introduction of rents covering all operating
costs;
-    redefinition and recalculation of tenants income;
-    introduction of financial incentives and penalties to
accelerate arrears collection;
-    shift of responsibility for social welfare determinations
and subsidy payments to the Ministry of Social Welfare;
-    sale of at least 40X of the existing rental housing stock;
-    promotion of home ownership among rental tenants;
These actions were approved in principle by Cabinet in November 1988 and will
form the basis for a detailed rental restructuring plan to be presented to the
Bank for review as a condition of disbursement of the rental rehabilitation
component (para. 3.13).
Future Performance
4.12     As noted, most of the above actions have already been taken and are
already having a positive impact on HA finances (cash flow crisis solved,
interest rates increased, about F$2.6 million in arrears collected by mid-
1989, management vacancies filled). These actions combined with the removal



- 30 -
of the subsidized rental program from HA's books as well as the rest of the
above actions would enable HA to reverse its deteriorating financial position,
ending operating deficits in 1990 and contributing surpluses to the capital
base which would elliminate accumulated deficits by 1995.
4.13     With periodic modest GOF capital contributions (a total of F$4 mil-
lion over five years) HA's debt/equity ratio would return by 1991 to a healthy
10:1 or below and the current ratio would be 1.1:1 or better.  Cash flow would
remain positive throughout the projection period and HA would generate inter-
nally nearly 60% of its financing requirements. Operations would improve from
a break-even result in 1990 to a surplus of 10% of revenues in 1991 and
averaging about 18Z of revenues in subsequent years. The return on equity
would improve to 19%t in 1990 and would average about 18Z thereafter. HA has
committed itself to adequate standards for capital structure, liquidity and
interest spreads in its Policy Statement (Annex 3, para 17.). This commitment
was confirmed at negotiations. As profitability is not specifically covered
in the Policy Statement, minimum return on equity of 5Z was agreed at negotia-
tions. To ensure ef'ficiency in HA's operations, a declining target for the
ratio of operating e!xpenses to average total assets was agreed at negotia-
tions. The ratio wcould be targeted to fall from the 1988 level of nearly 4X
to 2.7% by 1995.  HA's financial performance (based on the above indicators
plus those contained in the HA Policy Stiatement) would be reviewed with Bank
annually.
4.14     During the period of the project (1990-95), HA's housing development
and mortgage lending program would comprise only project-financed activities.
Total assets (adjusted for the removal of the rental program) would grow from
F$94.9 million in 1989 at an average rate of 4.22 to F$126.9 million in 1996.
The mortgage loan portfolio would increase from F$58.3 million at an average
rate of 8.4Z to F$102.3 million in 1995. Long-term debt would increase from
F$78.5 million in 1989 at an average rate of 7.9Z, reaching a peak of F$91.7
million in 1995. The onlent IBRD portion of long-term debt would rise from 5Z
in 1989 to 30% in 1995. FNPF's portion (luring the same period would fall from
94Z to 69Z. The balance of HA's long-term debt would be the remaining
balances on GOF, commercial bank and insurance company loans. Overdrafts and
promissory notes would reach a high of 8.5Z of total liabilities in 1990 and
would decline to 2Z by 1995.
B. PRB FINANCES
4.15     PRB was established by Presidential decree in May 1989 and by early
1990 the PRB board of directors had been appointed, the PRB policy statement
had received Cabinet endorsement, the Executive Secretary had been appointed,
the rental expert financed by the Japanese grant had been recruited, agreement
had been reached between MOF, MHUD, FNPF, HA and PRB on the transfer of rental
assets and liabilities (including the accumulated deficit of the rental
program) from HA to PRB. The steps remaining to be taken are: (a) completion
of the transfer of t'he rental program to PRB (this is a condition of
effectiveness; and (b) preparation of a detailed rental rehabilitation action
plan and PRB financial projections (this is a condition of disbursement of the
rental rehabilitation component).



- 31 -
4.16     A preliminary action plan and PRB financial projections were dis-
cussed at negotiations and are contained in Annex 5. According to this plan,
the restructuring of the rental program will focus on improving the cash flow
of this program through the sale of rental units, improved cost recovery and
other specific measures detailed in para. 4.11. These measures are expected
to be effective but it will require several years to get PRB on a sound finan-
cial footing. The cash flow forecast (Annex 5) indicates that the restructur-
ing plan would require GOF subventions of F$3.3 million in 1990 and F$1.4 mil-
lion in 1991. An operating surplus would be maintained for the next four
years as rental units are sold. Beginning in 1996 welfare payments of about
F$250,000 annually would be necessary to make up the difference between full-
cost rents and affordable rents in true hardship cases. The GOF subventions
in 1990 and 1991 could be considerably reduced if the sale of rental units and
the introduction of full-cost rents can be accelerated.



- 32 -
V. JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
Benefits
5.1      The project would provide somet 5,300 low and moderate income house-
holds with new plots and housing finance, and would cover approximately 28Z of
the estimated total demand (backlog plus new demand) in Suva/Nausori and
Lautoka during the project period. In addition, 700-800 tenant households
would benefit from the purchase of their rental units. Through smaller plots
and house designs and appropriate standards, the project is geared to the
needs and capabilities of lower income households and approximately 70Z of
the project beneficiaries would be in the bottom half of the urban income
distribution. Abouit 3Z of the plots produced under the project would be
affordable to households at or below the estimated urban poverty threshold.
The project would also generate important financial benefits for Government by
improving the finanicial condition of HA thereby reducing the deficits
Government would otherwise have to bear and by generating revenues for land
and water reticulation costs not hitherto recovered. Individual house
construction loans are expected to stimulate the small contracting sector and
generate approximaltely 2,000 jobs (para. 1.20). Policy development and insti-
tutional strengthening would lead to more efficient allocation of resources in
the urban sector and a more rational pattern of urbanization.
Environmental Impact
5.2      The project would have a positive impact on the physical environment
of the project cities. It would contribute to improved planning, control and
monitoring of human settlement. Properly designed and economically construc-
ted infrastructure systems, such as storm drainage, water and sewerage and
roads, would be supported under the project. The project would also improve
living conditions of about 800 tenant families in the public rental program as
well as the sanitary conditions of about 70 squatter households. Even though
no financing would be provided under the project for the construction of trunk
infrastructure facilities, assurances were obtained at negotiations that all
the requisite off-site infrastructure (trunk sewers, water transmission lines,
etc.) would be built by the responsible GOF agencies (para 3.11) and operated
satisfactorily (para. 3.26). Compliance with this condition would be closely
monitored to ensure the full beneficial impact of the project on its intended
beneficiaries, although this infrastruct:ure would benefit many more households
as well. In-site arrangements made (Appendix of Annex 9) for about 380
squatters in about 6 sites include measures that provide the squatters first
priority to purchase lots in the new subdivisions. HA's resettlement office
would also assist the squatters to move their existing houses within the site
and to get help from charitable organizations to purchase plots.
Cost Recovery and Affordability
5.3      The project would recover all development and financial costs
including land acquisition, site development, infrastructure, HA overhead and
interest during construction.  House construction loans would cover a maximum
of 80Z of construction cost, the balance coming from the beneficiary's down-
payment. Plot acquisition and house financing would be consolidated into a



- 33 -
single mortgage loan repayable over a maximum term of 20 years at an adjus-
table interest rate reflecting HA's average cost of funds plus a margin for
risk, operating costs and other financial costs not recovered in the price of
the plot/house. Based on this approach, the range of affordability of project
housing solutions would be from the 13th to the 70th percentiles (see Annex 11
for details). The distribution of plot/house sizes and types has been based
on the income distribution of the HA waiting list, on which 80Z of the appli-
cants are below the median urban income.
Economic Rate of Return
5.4      Based on end-1988 costs and recent rent levels for similar units and
locations, the economic rate of return on plots/houses developed under the
project would range from 11.8Z to 13.9Z (details are shown in Annex 12). The
cost stream includes the cost of land, civil works, house construction,
physical contingencies and maintenance. Benefits are based on imputed rents
for the plots/houses plus a premium for the value derived from increasing
urbanization of the surrounding community. The imputed rents are rather
conservatively estimated and could understate benefits, but the premium for
increasing urbanization could overstate benefits. As these factors tend to
offset each other, the rates of return should be relatively balanced. Bene-
fits based on imputed rents for project-financed improvements alone (without
later beneficiary-financed house expansion) would result in rates of return of
11.4Z to 212 while benefits calculated without the urbanization premium
generate returns of 9.7X to 10.7%. A 15% increase in cost (e.g. due to
construction delays) or a 15Z decrease in benefits (e.g. due to delays in
completion of house construction) would result in rates of return of 9.9% to
11.2Z and 9.7Z to 10.9%, respectively.
Risks
5.5      A risk for the project is that the revitalization and restructuring
of the housing program will stagnate or reverse itself. However, GOF and HA
have already demonstrated their commitment to reforming the housing program by
adopting new policies and making required changes to standards and practices.
There is also a risk that the project will exceed HA's implementation capacity
or that effective demand will not materialize for the new plots and house
loans. These risks are minimized by the tailoring of the project to HA's past
performance and recent demand surveys.

VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
6.1      Assurances were obtained at negotiations on the following:
(a)  complete and timely provision of off-site water, sewer and electrical
infrastructure for project sites (para. 3.11);
(b)  annual review with the Bank of HA's program and budget for the
following yesar (para 3.12);
(c)  implementation as agreed of the HA Revitalization Plan (para. 3.12)
and the PRB Rental Restructuring, Plan (para. 3.13);

schedule agreed with the Bank (para. 3.14);
(e)  submission Eor Bank review by June 30, 1993 and prior to GOF approval
of new policies and standards formulated by MHUD, TCPD and NLTB under
the project (para. 3.14);
(f)  MHUD formulation of study terms of reference and selection of consul-
tants, both acceptable to the Bank, for the policy operationalization
component by December 31, 1990 (para. 3.15);
(g)  prompt handover by HA to the concerned authorities of completed

of operations and maintenance responsibilities for these networks
(para. 3.26); and
(h)  minimum 5X return on HA equity and progressive reduction by HA of the
ratio of its operating expenses to its average total assets (para.
4.13); and
(i)  annual review of HA financial performance (para 4.13).

(b)  revision, satisfactory to the Bank, of HA bidding and evaluation
procedures and draft bid documents (paras. 3.11 and 3.17);
(c)  completion of the transfer of the rental program assets and liabili-
ties from HA to PRB (para 3.13).
6.3      The following would be disbursement conditions:
(a)  submission for Bank review and concurrence of HA criteria for project
sites to be developed in response to demand before disbursement on
these sites (para. 3.11);



- 35 -
(b) development of a detailed rental restructuring program, acceptable to
the Bank, before disbursement on the rehabilitation of rental units
(para. 3.13).
6.4      With the above assurances, agreements and conditions, the proposed
project would be suitable for a Bank loan to Fiji of US$16.2 million repayable
in 17 years, including a grace period of five years, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate.

FIJI
HOUSING PROJECT
Institutional Arrangements
A. Introduction
1.       The Government of Fiji's Housing Sector consists of the following
institutions:
(a) Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (MHUD)
(b) Housing Authority (HA)
(c) Public Rental Board (PRB)
(d) Native Land Trust Board (NLTB)
(e) Home Finance Corporation (HFC)
(f) Housing Assistance and Relief Trust (HART)
(g) City and Town Councils
2.       The Housing Authority is the main institutional beneficiary of the
project with both MHUD and NLTB receiving a limited amount of technical assis-
tance under the project. The following sections describe the various institu-
tions starting with MHUD which is responsible, inter alia, for formulating the
Nation's Urban Housing policies and coordinating the efforts of the various
institutions.
B. Ministry of Housing and Urban Development
Introduction
3.       The Ministry of Housing and Urban Development is responsible for
formulating and implementing policies for urban planning and land use, local
government, and housing. The Ministry is responsible for 13 statutory bodies:
Fiji's incorporated cities (2) and towns (8); the Housing Authority; the
National Trust for Fiji (preservation of historical buildings, sites, flora
and fauna); and the Suva Fire Brigade.
4.       The Minister is responsible for administering nine specific Acts:
Town Planning, Subdivision of Lands, Housing, Local Government, Business
Licensing, Markets, Fair Rents, National Trust of Fiji and Suva Fire Brigade.
These Acts require the Minister to exercise certain specific authorities,
including appeals to decisions taken by the Director, Town and Country Plan-
ning, appointment of members to the boards of MHUD's statutory bodies,
appointing local committees to investigate requests for city/town boundary
changes or the incorporation of a new city or town, approving business fees
set by local governments, approving loan and overdraft requests of local gov-
ernments, approving municipal by-laws, etc.

Organization and Staffing
5.       MHUD is a small ministry consisting of 45 established positions and
an annual operating budget of about F$850,700 (1988). It administers a vari-
ety of capital and operating grants from Government to local governments, the
Housing Assistance and Relief Trust, the National Trust for Fiji, and the
Housing Authority. For the last four years, grants have ranged between
F$2,100,000 and F$600,000 trending lower as a matter of policy.
6.       The Ministry is administered by a Permanent Secretary who reports to
the Minister. Twenty-eight of the 45 4established posts are assigned to the
Department of Town and Country Planning (TCPD) which is headed by a Director,
who supervises four sections: Enviromnent; Land Development Control; Land
Subdivision Control and Research and Forward Planning. TCPD sets planning and
land use policies, provides town plans, reviews and approves subdivision and
building requests, and handles requests for planning changes and exemptions.
7.       A staff assists the Minister in his responsibilities under the vari-
ous Acts, with local government functions accounting for the bulk of the work
load. There is no specialized policy analysis and development staff. Policy
matters are handled by the Permanent Secretary on an ad hoc basis. Small
accounting and personnel units provide services to the Ministry.
Areas Requiring Institutional Strengthening
8.       MHUD has limited capacity to carry out its responsibilities for the
development and implementation of housing and urban development policies.
Attempts have been made in the past to review and revise legislation in the
housing and urban sectors but the work has never been completed and sustained
because of the lack of capacity in the Ministry.
9.       TCPD plays an important role in directing the country's urban devel-
opment. Other government institutions such as HA, Public Works Department
(PWD) and NLTB as well as the private sector rely on TCPD's work. TCPD is
receiving assistance from several bilateral donors (Australia and Japan) to
further strengthen its institutional capabilities in forward planning and
information management. It needs additional assistance in the areas of moni-
toring of the urbanization process, development of standards for land use and
the incorporation of environmental concerns and safeguards in its overall work
policies, programs and procedures.
10.      The project would provide assistance to TCPD in these areas with one
resident advisor for a 12 month assignment, and short term consulting services
(6 months) for specific studies (see Annex 6 for details).
C.  Housinl Authority
Introduction
11.      The Housing Authority is a statutory body of the Government of Fiji
established by the Housing Act of 1955 to assist lower income citizens obtain



-  38  -                            ANNEX 1
Page 3
adequate housing. It produces serviced sites for sale, originates and ser-
vices residential mortgages and administers the Nation's rental housing and
village loan programs. It is responsible to the Ministry of Housing and Urban
Development. The Authority is managed by a Chief Executive who reports to a
Board of Directors appointed by the Minister for Housing and Urban Develop-
ment. Since its inception, the Authority has housed over 17,000 low and mid-
dle income families--about 34Z of the urban population in 1986.
Background
12.      HA's operations began in 1958 with cash loans for the purchase or
improvement of lower income homes, and the start of new home construction by
the HA for sale to lower income workers. During its first three years of
operations, HA served about 160 families. In 1964, the Rental Housing Program
began in order to assist lower income workers who "temporarily" could not
afford to own their own home. The Program envisioned tenants paying 15Z of
their income to the HA as rent with Government subsidizing the remainder of
the Authority's actual cost of providing rental accommodations. The produc-
tion of serviced sites began in 1971. By the end of 1987, HA had produced
about 8,300 serviced sites and 1,800 rental flats and homes, and provided
finance for some 7,000 mortgages. Although it operates nationwide and serves
both urban and rural populations, HA's operations are concentrated in Suva and
Lautoka.
13.      Initially, the Authority's six-person board contracted directly with
other organizations to construct and operate its housing programs. In 1967,
the Authority first appointed its own operating management and staff. At the
end of 1987, HA employed just under 300 people at a current cost of F$2.13
million for salaries and benefits, or F$7,100 per employee on average.
14.      At the end of 1987, HA was organized into the following major areas:
(a) Authority Secretary who is also in charge of Legal, Personnel and
Administrative Services, Planning and Public Relations;
(b) Housing and Development where land is acquired and developed into
sites, houses or flats. It is comprised of separate surveying, civil
engineering, and architectural units.
(c) Estates Administration where properties are sold or rented; mortgages
are originated and serviced; rents are collected; properties are
repossessed when necessary and resold/rented; and properties are
maintained. Estates is divided into a Central/Eastern (in Suva,
where HA's headquarters is located) and a Western/Northern (located
in Lautoka) Division;
(d) Finance where the accounting, treasury, budget and internal audit
functions are performed.
A chart showing the organization of HA as of March 1988 is attached as Appen-
dix A.

Page 4
Condition of the Housing Authority
15.      The Authority was on the verge of operational and financial collapse
at the end of 1987 after years of increaLsing net losses. Its original paid-in
capital base had been severely eroded. Multiple problems caused these contin-
uing losses including:  costly rental housing policies; negative lending
spreads; high administrative costs; and high mortgage lending arrears. In
addition to its financial difficulties, HA lacked many of the capabilities
needed by a housing development and finaLncing institution to perform effec-
tively and efficiently. HA's major institutional breakdowns and missing capa-
bilities in early 1988 are discussed in the following sections.
Accounting Policies and Data
16.      Many of thie financial policies and practices followed by the HA were
inappropriate for the nature of its business, the major problems being:
(a) absence of full accrual accounting;
(b) failure to make annual provisions for possible losses in the mortgage
portfolio;
(c)  automatic capitalization of arrears into the long-term mortgage port-
folio instead of backing aged arrears out of current income;
(d) failure to reconcile bank statements in a timely manner;
(e) slow, error-prone and low-capacity computerized accounting system;
(f)  lack of an accounting policy and procedures manual; and
(g) late and inaccurate financial information.
17.      One major effect of these inappropriate accounting policies and prac-
tices was the proba'bility that HA's historical net income and asset value were
overstated. Another effect was that the real financial circumstances of HA
were not made apparent to the management, the HA Board, the political direc-
torate and the citizens of the country.
Personnel
18.      Significant gaps developed in HIA key posts over the last several
years. Of its sixteen executive and managerial posts:
(a) one executive post and its entire area of responsibility (EDP) had
been "contracted out" because of the inability to recruit or retain
competent EDP staff.
(b) two were vacant;
(c)  two were filled with experienced HA staff;



ANNEX 1
-  40  -                            Page 5
(d) three were filled with people with less than one year service with
HA;
(e) eight were filled on an acting basis while the incumbents were still
doing their regular jobs.
19.      The top five posts in the HA were encumbered as follows:  Chief Exe-
cutive (Acting); Authority Secretary (filled, but also served as Acting CE);
Director Estates Administration 1/ (Vacant); Finance Director (Acting);
Director Housing and Development (Acting). The Minister of Housing and Urban
Development was new to his post and to the field of housing. The HA board was
also new, except for one carryover member from the previous board. The board
also lacked representatives with banking/financial markets experience, and the
MOF, which--one way or the other--must deal with any HA deficits, was not
represented on the Board.
20.      HA staff were reportedly demoralized for a number of reasons:  a
recent 15Z salary cut; the fact that HA was under investigation for contract-
ing irregularities; and from a long history of "lack of leadership" and
"trouble' at the top of the Authority. In addition, those responsible for
collections complained of the lack of support from the political level which
they felt was undermining the collections program.
Policy Environment
21.      HA operates under an Act passed in 1955 without subsequent substan-
tive revision. The current Act invites interpretation of housing as primarily
a 'social welfare program' while requiring the HA to operate as an autonomous,
financially independent body, thereby creating an operational paradox for all
associated with the HA.
22.      Not surprisingly, HA internal policies also reflected a much greater
concern for 'social welfare" than for financial viability and operational
efficiency. For example:
(a) policies set by the HA Board dealt mainly with the regulation of flat
rentals; the sale of, and lending for, sites and houses; and the
administration of mortgage and rental contracts, while only slight
attention was paid to maintaining HA overall financial viability;
(b) mortgage arrears were allowed to accumulate up to one year before
beginning action on repossession and resale;
(c) policy discussions and initiatives to produce more housing for poorer
workers sought subsidies from Government rather than lower production
costs through the adoption of realistic housing standards which would
be affordable to lower income workers and greater efficiency in the
HA;
1/ This post was abolished in the subsequent HA reorganization.



ANNEX 1
-  41  -                             Page 6
(d) borrower interest rates were set so as to rise progressively with the
size of the HA mortgage, with no concern evident for the cost of
funds to HA nor the "lending spread" required to make HA financially
viable;
(e)  no evidence of internal financial policies and objectives appropriate
to a lending institution could be found in HA's published policies,
e.g., debt/equity ratio; debt: service coverage; provisions for
losses; income recognition; maturity and rate matching; lending
spread; building reserves; liLquidity level, capital preservation and
growth, etc..
Housing Output
23.      While HA has produced a signi.ficant number of high standard houses
over the years, it never was able to keep up with the demand for houses, nor
could it meet the targets set for it in Fiji's various development plans. In
1988, only the upper 50Z of the household income distribution could afford the
housing developed by the Authority. And only some 1,700 families could be
accommodated in existing rental flats which were intended for the very lowest
income levels, although not necessarily all occupants were truly low income
families. HA waiting lists of prospective buyers and renters covered close to
5,000 families. In 1987 the production of new housing by both government and
the private sector fell significantly and the number of squatters--estimated
at 1 of 8 urban families in 1986 started to increase sharply.
Organizational Culture
24.      HA's maniagement culture was functional/hierarchical, i.e., central-
ized authority at Board and senior management levels with organizational units
operating with few lateral, working-le!vel interactions--operating as if they
were isolated, independent compartments. While this culture can be adequate
for activities that are largely repetitive and routine (e.g., accounting,
mortgage collections, administrative services, property management), it is
inadequate for housing production. Effective and efficient site development
and house construction requires a decentralized, noncompartmentalized culture.
25.      Evidence exists to support the conclusion that HA's functional/
hierarchical approach to the production of housing had contributed to its
operating losses, e.g., the burden of a F$2.5 million inventory of raw land,
partially developed and completed sitets 2/ some of which is of doubtful value.
It was a production system lacking coordination and clear purpose, where: one
unit acquires land that is costly to develop; another develops land that can't
be built upon efficiently; a third builds houses unaffordable to the target
clientele; and yet another unit must sell these houses at a loss or to people
who are credit risks. Even after properties are sold, HA is left holding the
responsibility for providing local government services, without full cost
2/ As of November 1988, HA had an inventory of 3,500 unsold completed
plots (some with completed houses) and works-in-progress at a
historically high level--twice that of 1984.



-  42  -                            ANNEX 1
Page 7
recovery, because of inefficient procedures for the handover of completed
infrastructure to competent authorities for maintenance.
Management Direction and Coordination
26.      Coordination and direction was not only lacking in the production of
housing in HA. A lack of coordination and direction was a "way of life"
throughout the Authority for some long time. Concepts, mechanisms, and tech-
niques to ensure coordination among units and to sharpen and build consensus
around goals and objectives are not to be found in HA and the consequences of
their absence are evident.
27.      Authority-wide planning was carried out piecemeal with a short term
planning horizon and without collaboration on the part of the executives who
had to do the work. Operationally, the various parts of HA exercised their
bureaucratic "right" to be involved in a particular process rather than colla-
boratively seeking the simplicity and speed required by HA to be efficient and
effective. For instance, mortgage documents were originated in one unit,
routinely passed to another for legal scrutiny and to a third for recording in
the accounts--causing delays and errors along the way. Accounts receivable
management also involved the duplicate, slow and error prone work of two sepa-
rate units. And as mentioned above HA plots and houses were produced in the
same uncoordinated and compartmentalized manner.
Fundamental Problems
28.      The political and economic problems that arose in Fiji in 1987 took a
toll on the HA. Vacancies in the ranks, arrears at historically high levels,
general financial deterioration and staff morale problems were to a certain
degree, related to these problems. However it needs to be recognized that
most of HA's problems predate 1987 indicating that more is involved and that
the search for the cause should not end there.
29.      Since its inception, HA has been faced with, indeed has been, an
operational paradox. To put it simply, those connected with the Authority
have been caught in the bind of believing they had no choice but to attempt to
provide high standard, low-income housing while operating like a commercial
business--i.e., an independent statutory body with its own financial accounta-
bility--but without access to sufficient fiscal subsidies to allow it to pay
its costs and debts. Under such circumstances, it was only a matter of time
before the impossibility of such a way of operating would become inescapably
apparent. That time has now come, perhaps hastened and exacerbated by the
events of 1987, but not really caused by them.
Policy, Financial, and Institutional Revitalization
Revitalization Plan
30.      Through a collaborative effort by the Bank, ADB and UNDP/Habitat
staff and consultants working with officials of GOF and HA, a plan (Annex 2)
for the comprehensive restructuring of Government's housing program was
designed with the objective of providing adequate housing to lower income
citizens in a manner satisfying and affordable to both recipients of housing



43-                              ANNEX 1
Page 8
assistance and the Government's budget. This plan was approved by Cabinet in
November 1988.
31.      The plan includes the redesign of the policy regime governing the
work of HA including the separation of the rental housing program from the
accounts of HA, a redesign of HA's organizational, planning and operational
format, the introduction of concepts and techniques to produce affordable
housing for lower income citizens, and a restructuring of HA's finances and
financial management policies and operations. Much of this plan will have
been completed or initiated before Board presentation. The remainder will be
undertaken during project implementation. Grant funds provided by the Japan
Fund and ADB, and a small amount of the loan for computers and related equip-
ment, will be utilized to strengthen HA.'s institutional capabilities. The
following sections summarize the major action components of the restructuring
plan.
Rental Housing
32.      Government's costly (on average, total cost is F$1,650 per family per
year), subsidized (on average, subsidy is F$1,250 per family per year) rental
housing program is being removed from the HA accounts and transferred to a
separate entity whose operating results and governmental subsidies will be
fully transparent. To accomplish this, the Public Rental Board (PRB) has been
established as a statutory body under MHUD. HA will provide support to PRB
for government for a three year period, using fully segregated accounts.
33.      On the basis of a study carried out by an ADB-financed consultant
during preparation of the project (see summary at Annex 4), Government has
developed an action plan and policy statement (Annex 5) for the restructuring
of the rental housing program which is expected to include:
(a) the sale of approximately 40Z of the existing rental units to setting
tenants or, other parties with 'HA mortgage loans;
(b) the establishment of rent charges at economic or market rates with
any subsidies required by individual tenants to be provided by Gov-
ernment's welfare program;
(c) the promotion of home ownership by long-term tenants and a public
information/community participation program for tenants of rental
estates; and
(d) the definition (as part of the housing and urbanization policy formu-
lation component) of appropriate roles for the public and private
sectors in housing (including rental housing) as well as legal and
other changes to promote the provision/production of rental housing
by the private sector.
34.      At the end of the three year restructuring period, the program would
be reviewed and its future decided with the possibility that responsibility
for it might revert to HA, be placed elsewhere in Government, continued indef-
initely as PRB, or terminated. The project is assisting (via the Japan Grant



-  44  -                           ANNEX 1
Page 9
Fund) the start-up and operation of PRB with residential and short-term tech-
nical assistance, start-up accounting and audit services, and funding for the
rehabilitation (via the IBRD loan) of rental units for sale.
HA Policy Statement
35.      The HA board has adopted a Policy Statement (Annex 3), endorsed by
the Cabinet (November 1988) which provides that:
(a) HA will produce, and finance through long-term mortgages, shelter for
families who would not otherwise have access to the kinds of housing
they would both desire and afford.
(b) HA will proportionately serve households whose total family income
falls between the 20th and 80th percentiles of the national urban
income distribution.
(c) HA will concentrate on producing serviced sites in sizes and at costs
affordable by its target population, and financing mortgages for new
lots and houses. It will also upgrade substandard neighborhoods upon
community request.
(d) HA will work closely and cooperatively with the Town and Country
Planning Department, local authorities and other regulatory agencies
to ensure appropriate standards and efficient site development
thereby allowing the provision of affordable shelter to all HA target
beneficiaries.
(e) HA will not impose constraints on sold properties. Purchasers of HA
properties will be free to enjoy and use their property as they
please, subject to regulations established by national and local
agencies.
(f) Rental housing will not be included in future HA financed housing
programs. Any management or construction of rental housing would be
the responsibility of the appropriate authority (PRB) with its own
finances.
(g) HA projects will be designed and managed--from inception to the final
sale of all lots and turnover of infrastructure--under the authority
and responsibility of "Project Managers,' who report to the Director,
Housing and Development, and ensure that:
(i) lots offered for sale are affordable and desirable by the target
beneficiaries in proportion to their representation in the popu-
lation as a whole, varying standards to attain affordability;
(ii) adequate and affordable provisions are made for and agreed to by
any squatters on the land before land acquisition or development
begins;



-  45  -                            ANNEX 1
Page 10
(iii)  electricity, water and sewerage will be available on time to
allow the prompt sale and occupation of lots as they are devel-
oped;
(iv)  as the lots are occupied, local governance arrangements, includ-
ing owner associations, will be available to provide for commu-
nal needs and services;
(v)  due consideration is given to transportation and access to work,
stores and services in choosing sites;
(vi) due consideration is given to the health and environmental con-
cerns of the Nation; and
(vii)  industrial and commercial sities are developed in conjunction
with residential lot development and land is set aside for play-
grounds, churches and other communal needs, as appropriate;
(h)  HA will operate on a fully "self-sufficient" financial basis without
Government sub'sidies.
(i)  HA will make mortgage loans for a maximum of 30 years incorporating
adjustable rates which will be reset semiannually based on HA's
weighted cost of funds with limits set on annual and life of mortgage
maximum and minimum adjustments;
(j)  HA is committed to the vigorous pursuit of mortgage payments due to
it and will take prompt legal action against accounts in default.
Accounts in arrears 30 days will receive notices by mail of possible
default; accounts 60 days in arrears will be contacted in person or
by telephone; accounts in arrears 90 days of more where no workout
has been agreed to will be considered in default and legal action
instituted to repossess the property.
(k)  In November of each year the CE will recommend to the Board the oper-
ational plan and budget for the next year. These recommendations, in
such manner and detail as prescribed by the Board, will be supported
by a five-year financial projections, prepared by the management, and
indicating clearly the assumptions and policies used to make the
forecast, highlighting where changes to previous year assumptions and
policies were made. In reviewing the budget, operating plan and
financial projections, HA's financial and policy assumptions will
also be reviewed by the Board, including, inter alia, the lending
spread for the next six months.
(1) In its planning and administration of HA, Management is directed to
produce, maintain and/or observe the following standards:



ANNEX 1
-  46  -                            Page 11

Composition of the HA Board and Revision of the Housing Act
36.      On December 1, 1988, the Minister (MHUD) appointed a new HA Board
with 2 new members from the banking and finance sector thus remedying a key
weakness of previous HA Boards. The Minister, MHUD will submit to Cabinet
during the course of the project a revised Housing Act reflecting the outcome
of the project-financed policy formulation work as well as the objectives and
philosophy of the HA Policy Statement.
HA Organizational and Operational Changes
Overall Structure and Key Executive Appointments
37.      The HA Board has adopted a revised organizational structure--Appendix
B--and has filled all but two of the senior executive positions with compe-
tent, experienced staff. The two unfilled posts--Corporate Planning Manager
and EDP Manager--have been filled by experts funded under the Project (Japan
Grant Fund).
Housing Production
38.      Project Managers have been designated for all sites and housing proj-
ects underway or planned by HA. A Project Management Advisor has been engaged
to guide the transformation of the HA housing production system. Initial
project management operating concepts and procedures have been developed and
additional short term consultants will be engaged as necessary to develop
specific procedures and techniques for working in a "project manager" format.
39.      With the assistance of UNDP/Habitat financed consultants, the physi-
cal production program for the HA to be financed by the project has been pre-
pared. In the process, a computerized 'housing affordability model' has been
introduced into the HA which will be used by the project managers to plan and
review all HA housing projects. New housing standards that ensure adequate



ANNEX 1
Page 12
and affordable housing for low income wiage earners have been formulated and
adopted for the project by the HA, and ratified by the Cabinet and other min-
istries involved in establishing and administering such standards.
Accounting and Financial Management Information System
40.      With the assistance of a consultant financed by the ADB during the
preparation of the project, a thorough study has been carried out of the HA
computerized accounting system and related management information needs. A
summary of the consultant's report and the proposed implementation schedule of
his recommendations is at Appendix C. Through the Japan Grant, an Accounting
Policy and Systems advisor has been engaged for two years and an EDP Manager
for 30 months. Together with the Finance Director and the top management
team, the EDP Manager and the Accounting Adviser will order, install a new
computer and accou;nting system in HA and train staff in their use. The
Accounting Policy and Systems advisor will also prepare, for adoption by the
HA Board, a comprehensive financial and accounting policy and procedural man-
ual.  The new accounting system will provide on-line access to mortgage origi-
nation and collections officers who will enter data directly into HA accounts
(following computer programmed protocols and subject to strict internal con-
trols) thereby elimninating the current duplication between the lending and
accounting staffs and reducing the potential for delays and errors.
Corporate Planning
41.      With the help of consultants financed by the Bank and UNDP/Habitat, a
financial projections model has been developed and introduced into HA. This
model has been taken over by the new Corporate Planning Staff and the Corpo-
rate Planner engaged under the Japan Fund for use as a key management tool in
the HA. The Corporate Planner will report administratively to the Deputy
General Manager bul: will work closely with HA senior executives who function
as HA's Strategic Planning Team.
Financial Restructuring
42.      The financial projections model mentioned above has been used to
design the restructuring of HA finances. With a consultant financed during
preparation by UNDP/Habitat, a thorough analysis of HA's financial condition
and its various financial problems and breakdowns has been undertaken, and
advice has been provided on the immediate steps HA could take to improve its
financial position., HA has moved creatively and vigorously to strengthen
itself financially over the past several months. With the active support of
the Minister, MHUD and effective action by HA managers and staff, collection
volume has improvecd dramatically. HA collected in 1988 about F$9 million in
mortgage principle and interest which represents more than 100Z of the new
payments coming due during the year and therefore reducing arrears by approxi-
mately F$0.5 million. In addition, HA is making contact with every borrower
in arrears and is working out arrangements for the repayment of all amounts
overdue. HA has also moved quickly into the short term borrowings to improve
its liquidity. Finally, Government has provided an additional F$l million in
new capital and Cabinet has committed to provide additional capital for future
needs when required by the financial restructuring plan. The financial plan

-48   -                             Page 13
for the HA and its financial situation are covered in full in Chapter IV. of
the SAR and in Annex 10.
Mortgage Lending
43.      HA has separated its mortgage lending operations from its rental and
estates management activities. In recognition of the vital importance of the
management of the mortgage origination and servicing function to the viability
of HA, mortgage lending is now a "directorate" within the HA. The new compu-
terized accounting system with its on-line terminals for mortgage origination
and servicing will greatly assist this directorate to become more effective
and more efficient while serving the HA's clients better than in the past.
Rental Management
44.      While rental assets and liabilities are being transferred to the
Public Rental Board, HA will provide managerial and administrative services to
the PRB for property management (and the restructuring of the rental program)
on a fee basis. A new organizational arrangement has been developed (see
chart at Annex 5) to undertake the operation and restructuring of the rental
program. HA will provide accounting, personnel, administration and other
services to PRB for a fee.
Training, Equipment and Software
45.      Considerable training in new methods, systems and technologies must
be provided to HA staff over the next several years. The vast bulk of this
training will be done on-the-job, guided by HA managers with assistance from a
limited number of long and short term advisors financed by the project. Staff
will be trained to use new systems and technologies to do their work, and the
way technologies are chosen and systems designed will lead to significantly
improved efficiency and effectiveness in many HA departments. For example, the
computers and software being acquired for the accounts receivable system would
literally "coach' staff on how to do their work as they go about it. In addi-
tion, a small amount of funds are being provided for short term courses and
short term learning tours of comparable operations in other developed and
developing countries.
46.      The program of technical assistance (experts, training and computing
equipment and software) for the HA referred to above is shown in Annex 6 cov-
ering all the technical assistance components of the project.
D. The Native Land Trust Board
Introduction
47.      The Native Land Trust Board (NLTB), established in 1946, is the sta-
tutory body responsible for the administration of all native lands on behalf
of the native owners. Native lands constitute about 83Z the country's total
land resource.



-  49  -                             ANNEX 1
Page 14
48.      With regard for both the native owners and the nation as a whole,
NLTB makes undeveloped native land available for development and administers
leases it arranges on such land ensuring that: rents and fees are paid when
due; rent reassessments are made on a t1mely basis; owners and tenants fulfill
the terms of their leases; native owners are promptly, accurately and effi-
ciently paid monies owed them. NLTB is also responsible for establishing and
dissolving native land "Reservations."
Organization and Staffing
49.      NLTB employed about 200 staff as of June 30, 1988 with annual operat-
ing expenditures of nearly F$4 million. NLTB's principal source of income is
commissions on the leases it arranges andi administers. It also receives an
annual salary subvention grant of F$l mi'Llion from the Governiment budget. It
operates at close to break even on averagye, and of its balance sheet total of
close to F$5 million, 40% (F$2 million) iLs carried as capital surpluses and
reserves.
The Board
50.      The Board consists of the followring members:  the President of Fiji,
who is President of the NLTB, the Minister of Fijian Affairs and Rural Devel-
opment (Chairman), five Fijian members appointed by the Great Council of
Chiefs, three Fijian members appointed by, the Fijian Affairs Board; and not
more than two members of any race appointed by the President. The Board meets
monthly to set policy and monitor operations having delegated day to day oper-
ating responsibilities to management. The General Manager attends Board meet-
ings but is not a memaber of the Board.
The Operating Organization
51.      NLTB is run by the General Manager who is responsible for day to day
operations. He is assisted by the Deputy General Manager who is also Chief
Estate Officer and thie senior professional officer. NLTB headquarters are in
Suva. It operates in decentralized format through three Division Estates
Offices in Lautoka, Nrausori and Labasa, each of which covers a geographical
area identical to thet administrative division of the country. Divisional
offices are responsibile for land management work and make most of the deci-
sions on such matters on behalf of the NLTB. Each office operates through a
number of Estate Field Teams which do the ground work of property inspection,
reassessment, creating new leases, valuations, terminations, etc..
52.      The Headquarters Estate Office handles special cases:  hotel and
tourist leases, timber concessions and licenses, quarrying, etc.. Also
located at headquarters are the following departments: Finance (internal
finance, rent collections and distributionis, computing, accounting and admin-
istrative services); Legal; and Human Resource, Management Services and Audit.
Each of these is headed by an Assistant General Manager.
53.      Given that native lands constitutie the vast majority of Fiji's land
resource, the work of the NLTB touches upon all facets of the economic devel-
opment of the country and the social welfaire of its people, including housing



ANNEX 1
- 50 -                            Page 15
availability. NLTB has a reputation for competence in its work and manage-
ment. It has underway a sophisticated, computerized Land Information System
which will eventually provide accurate land data for the entire country.
Areas Requiring Institutional Strengthening
54.      An area in need of strengthening is land use planning and policy
within NLTB. In 1980/81, the U.S. Peace Corps placed two town planners at
NLTB. The work they accomplished (land use studies of towns and urban areas,
a study of an agricultural area, a study of squatters, and a major tourism
study) proved valuable to the Board and staff. Most of the recommendations of
the studies have been followed. The Peace Corps contract was not renewed
because it was felt at that time that there were sufficient plans to guide the
NLTB's future work. But it is now realized that land use planning activities
should be ongoing to adjust to changing conditions and demands.
55.      An urban planner with experience in Fiji was hired in March 1987 to
reactivate planning activities. He has worked on updating some of the urban
area plans as well as tourism and environmental planning. NLTB wants to
establish a planning unit composed of a Senior Planning Officer, two Land Use
Planners and two technical support staff. A planner was recruited from
Australia and began to start work in 1989. The second expatriate planner
would be provided by the project, along with computing hardware to connect the
planning system to the Land Information System and funds for staff training.
The two expatriate planners would train counterparts who would take over the
planning responsibilities. Annex 6 contains further details on the technical
assistance to be provided to NLTB.
E. Other Institutions
56.      The Home Finance Corporation is a quasi-public entity jointly owned
by the Government of Fiji, the FNPF, and the British Commonwealth Development
Corporation. HFC finances residential mortgages for middle and upper income
citizens. The Housing Assistance and Relief Trust is a charitable organiza-
tion that arranges temporary housing for indigent families and provides assis-
tance to get the family back on its own. Fiji currently has two City Councils
and eight Town Councils. These councils have the authority to develop urban
plans and codes and review and approve subdivision and building applications.
Only the City Councils have their own urban staff; the Towns depend upon the
expertise of MHUD. Local authorities do not own, build or administer public
housing.

Housing Authority Management Information Systems and Data Processing _/
Background
1.       The present management information system is based on a small
Honeywell computer which was installed in May 1983. The main application is
accounts receivable which was introduced in July 1983; the other applications
are general ledger, accounts payable, payroll and waiting list which were
added later, the most recent in 1985.
2.       At the time their installation was a major undertaking for the Auth-
ority because of the complexity of the programs and the desire to improve
substantially on the previous systems.
Financial Information
3.       The present systems are intended to provide monthly financial state-
ments which are up to date, accurate and relevant. The study shows that this
is not the case; that the accounts are five months behind and that management
has to rely on other sources of information such as bank balances to manage
the Authority.
4.       The delays and errors are caused by insufficient planning and coordi-
nation, mistakes in operating, and inadequate accounting resources. But these
problems can be eliminated and the Authority is currently making extra efforts
to deal with them appropriately.
Customer Information
5.       The present systems are also .intended to maintain up-to-date customer
accounts so that customers can be provided with accurate balances, and arrears
can be acted on immediately to prevent them from becoming worse. The study
shows that the accounts are four weeks behind, and that extra work and delays
occur when up-to-date information is required for arrears notices and mortga-
gee sales.
6.       These delays like those in the? financial accounts can be reduced and
the Authority is endeavoring to bring the accounts up to date as soon as pos-
sible. The Authority is not in a position to make any changes which require a
major programming development. It has only one programmer of its own (joined
August 1, 1988) and he is needed to keep the present system operating.

Data Processing by Ian Crawford for the Asian Development Bank, August

New Needs to be Met
7.       It is in the key areas of management information and customer ser-
vices that the present systems are inadequate for the Authority's current and
future needs. In the accounting area, the financial results of the Author-
ity's activities, e.g. mortgage lending, are not separated, there is not
accrual accounting and no commitment information. In the nonaccounting area
there is a need for systems which can provide assistance in property manage-
ment, loan management and sales analysis.
8.       For customer service, there is a need to provide information which is
completely up to date and accurate.
New Systems Needed
9.       The present system is a batch one which has been superseded by new
technology called interactive systems. This can meet the new needs which the
batch system cannot do. It uses on-line receipt terminals user data entry and
automatic transfer of salary deductions.
10.      New software is required because the concepts are entirely different.
New hardware is also required because the study shows that to upgrade the
present hardware would not be cost effective.
Need for Assistance
11.      Assistance will be needed to prepare for and install the new system,
and to provide appropriate in-house training. There will be a need to prepare
tender documents, evaluate proposals, recommend equipment and supervise the
installation of the new system. This is estimated to take 36 months and needs
to be provided by a data processing manager on assignment. A senior program-
mer will also be required to provide technical training in programming (12
months).
Development of In-house Resource
12.      The Authority is not receiving a satisfactory service from its pres-
ent contractor of computer management and operations. There is a lack of
knowledge of the existing programs and delays in the completion of work sched-
ules.
13.      The Authority needs to build up its own programming and operations
expertise rather than rely on outside services. It will need to train its own
staff because skilled programmers cannot be recruited locally. It should take
on at least four trainee programmers and provide them with the training needed
to develop and code programs using database and a fourth generation language.
Recommendations
14.      The recommendations to the Authority are as follows:



ANNEX 1
-  55  -                          Appendix C
Page 3
(a) It installs a new interactive system designed to improve its manage-
ment information and customer service facilities.
(b)  It installs systems in the nonaccounting areas of property manage-
ment, loan, management and sales analysis.
(c)  To assist in the implementation of the new systems, it requests
assistance with a data processing manager for 36 months and a senior
programmer for 12 months.
(d)  It builds up its own programming expertise by recruiting at least
four trainee programmers and providing them with suitable training.
(e)  Until a data processing manager can be appointed, it assigns a senior
executive to manage the present: installation.
(f) It investigates the installation of cashier facilities in major shop-
ping areas where each office would have an interactive terminal.
Other Requirements
15.      The consultant's terms of reference did not cover a review of the
Authority's accounting policies but it was apparent during the study that
these need to be revised and documented, and any changes appropriately intro-
duced. Furthermore the review needs to be carried out concurrently with the
preparation of the tender documents for the new system so that the policy
requirements can be properly implemented. Assistance is required for this
work.

Cabinet Memorandum 1/
Revitalization of the Fiji Housing Authority
(Memorandum by the Minister for Housing and Urban Development)
1.       Since December 1987 when the present Interim Government took office,
eight papers on the Housing Authority operation and finances have been dis-
cussed by Cabinet.
2.       The basic issues which were highlighted and discussed in those Papers
primarily revolved around the operational and financial difficulties of the
Housing Authority. Although some of the decisions of Cabinet have addressed
those problems and issues, further measures and actions are required to bring
about long term and lasting solutions.
3.       Realizing the grave situation the Housing Authority was in, Govern-
ment in 1986 sought the assistance of the World Bank to finance some of the
Housing Authority projects. The same assistance was also sought from the
Asian Development Bank later in 1987.
4.       Both the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, through the find-
ings of their personnel and consultants who had thoroughly reviewed the cur-
rent policies, programs and operation of the Housing Authority, affirm that
the Authority is in a critical financial situation.
5.       They emphasized that certain measures must be put in place now and
other specific actions be taken immediately by both Government and Housing
Authority to save the Authority from the brink of bankruptcy. Some of those
measures and actions are also the prerequirements of the two Banks for the
further consideration of the loan to Housing Authority.
6.       This Memorandum explains:
(a) the current status of the Housing Authority and its program;
(b) the causes of the current difficulties;
(c) a program of restructuring the Authority's rental housing program,
finances and operations; and
1/ This memorandum was considered and approved by the GOF Cabinet on
November 1988.



ANNEX 2
-  57  -                            Page 2
(d) the corrective actions to be taken to turn around the Authority into
a viable and dynamic institution.
(i)  Current Status
Development Plan 9 estimatied that an annual production of 5,835
dwellings (29,175 over the plan period) will be needed to accom-
modate new households and replace and upgrade substandard stock
between 1986-90.
The Authority is unlikely to meet its projected supply of 13,050
houses and sites during the 5 years of the plan. During the
first 2 years, it only succeeded in completing 3,168 units or
sites and this accounts for 24.2Z of the 5 year target.
Between 1979 and 1987, the Authority went through continuous
operating losses. Appendix 1 illustrates the accumulative defi-
cit for that nine-year per.iod. The current cumulative operating
deficit stands at F$8.930 mnillion.
Over 15.7Z of the Authority's mortgage accounts are in long term
arrears, man for as long as 60 months with total arrears of
approximately F$6.998 million. During 1987, it collected only
60Z of the mortgage interest and principal due to it.
The Authority recovered only 23.2Z of its expenditures on rental
housing in 1987. Rental program loss of estimated F$1.907 mil-
lion was the largest single component of its 1987 deficits. The
total breakdown is as follows:
Net rental deficit                F$ 1.907 million
Net interest deficit              F$ 0.040 million
Net administration expenditure  F$ 1.074 million
F$ 3.021 million
Prior to the recent adjustment in interest rate following Cabi-
net Decision No. 79 on IGCE (88)53, the Authority borrowed funds
at higher rates than it charged to its own mortgagees.
The Authority's administrative expenses run at about 2.5Z of its
total assets, making it an expensive operation compared to
others of its kind.
Given this dismal background, the Authority will need an infu-
sion of F$5 million in 1988 to keep afloat.
Vigorous steps by the new Board and the Chief Executive have
already begun to show results. The mortgage and arrears collec-
tion has improved.



ANNEX 2
-  58  -                            Page 3
(ii) Causes of its Difficulties
A firm consensus exists among the new Housing Authority Board
and management and World Bank/Asian Development Bank/United
Nations Experts that the main cause of the Authority's current
dilemma is the excessive 'social welfare" orientation of the
Government and the Authority in the low income housing program,
almost from its inception.
A classic illustration of its social welfare role is amply dem-
onstrated in the case of the operation of the Authority's Rental
Housing Program.
Currently, the total annual average family expenditure incurred
by the HA to house each of the 1,700 families occupying the
Authority's Rental flats is F$1,650.
Based on the above expenditure, a family occupying a rental flat
could be provided at no cost to them a serviced site in 2 years
for the same money now spent to maintain their flat. The family
could move to their new site and build temporary home which
could be improved and made permanent in the future.
Or take the case of a family occupying a rental flat for 4
years. The total amount spent by the Authority to maintain the
flat in 4 years = 4 x F$1,650 = F$6,600. This amount of money
is sufficient to develop a serviced site and construct a core
home on it in three to four years. The core house could be
improved and extended as the family income increases.
The net effect of allowing families to occupy rental flat at
present level of maintenance costs is that one family is reason-
ably taken care of at the expense of 5-10 other families. The
tragedy does not stop here. Even at the end of 20 years, the
family occupying the flat can never claim ownership.
(iii)  Restructuring the Rental Housing Program
All evidence before the Housing Authority Board and the World
Bank/Asian Development Bank consultants suggest that so long as
the deficit laden rental housing program is on the Authority's
books, the Housing Authority cannot become a financially viable
institution.
The situation is desperate but not hopeless.
The Housing Authority, ADB/WB consultants, my Ministry and I
fully endorse the proposal that a Public Rental Board (PRB) be
immediately established and decreed. The assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenditures of the rental program would be trans-
ferred to the PRB. Appendix 2 outline the constitution, powers



ANNEX 2
- 59  -                             Page 4
and responsibilities of the PRB.  The draft decree which will
effect the PRB will be tabled at the meeting.
The existing arrangements that apply to the Authority would
apply to the PRB.
The HA would continue to manage the Rental Housing Program, but
using the PRB funds instead of the HA funds. It should continue
as such until a firm decision is made as to the future of the
Government provided rental housing in the Nation.
The Authority's Board would serve as the Board for the PRB and
the Chief Executive of the Authority would serve as the Chief
Executive of the PRB. A senior staff of the Authority would
manage the rental program.
The PRB would be provided with the authority to borrow funds
with Government guarantees to fund its operating deficit for its
first- year of operation. The Government's annual budget will
take care of its operations for the subsequent years. The anti-
cipated deficit for 1989 is about F$2 million.
The consultant financed by the Asian Development Bank has done
an in-depth study of the rental program. His analysis together
with the remedial action as suggested should see the rental
program operating at break-even point over a passage of time.
However, this matter is still the subject of further study.
Housing Authority Operational Policy
7.       With the removal of the rental flats, the Housing Authority proper
will be left with iLts own assets, liabilities, revenues, expenditures and the
historical deficit associated with the production and sale of sites and
houses.
8.       The HA Board has adopted a policy statement which would govern the
operation of the home ownership program. A copy of the statement is attached
at Appendix 3.
9.       Its key features are:
(a) The objective of the HA is to produce and finance through long-term
mortgages, shelter for families who would not otherwise have access
to the kinds of housing they would both desire and afford.
(b) The HA will serve households w]hose total family income falls between
the 20th and 80th percentiles of the national income distribution.
(c) The HA will operate on a fully "self-sufficient" financial basis
without Government subsidies.



ANNEX 2
-  60  -                            Page 5
(d)  The HA is committed to the vigorous pursuit of mortgage payments due
to it and will take prompt legal action against accounts in default.
(e)  The HA will concentrate on producing serviced sites in sizes and
costs affordable by its target population, upgrading substandard
neighborhood when the community so requests, and financing mortgages
for lots and houses.
(f)  The HA will work closely and cooperatively with Town and Country
Planning, Local Authorities and other regulatory agencies to ensure
efficient site development and standards allowing the provision of
affordable shelter to all HA target beneficiaries.
(g)  The HA will not impose constraints on properties once they have been
sold. Purchasers of HA properties will be free to enjoy and use
their property as they please subject to regulations established by
national and local authorities.
(h)  Rental housing will not be included in future HA financed programs.
Management or construction of rental housing would be on contract to
other agencies.
10.      It is hoped that Cabinet will agree for HA to operate in accordance
with this policy statement until such time as the Housing Act of 1955 can be
revised in a manner which conforms to the policy statement. Recommended
changes to the Housing Act are attached in Appendix 4 for Cabinet's informa-
tion.
11.      Separation of the Rental Housing Program and adoption by all sections
of Government of the policy and operational philosophy inherent in the new
policy statement for the Home Ownership Program provides an environment in
which the HA can operate effectively with financial viability in the future
and paves the way for the proposed WB/ADB Loan.
HA Capital Requirements
12.      With the active support of the present Government, HA has already
initiated, or completed, a large number of internal changes to ensure that its
future operations are effective and financially viable. These are mentioned
briefly in Appendix 5.
13.      Appendix 6 contains a ten-year financial projection of HA's Balance
Sheet, Income Statement and Source and Applications of funds statement along
with the assumptions used to produce this plan, assuming in these that the
Rental program has been removed from HA's books. (Appendix 7 shows the unac-
ceptable consequences of leaving rental housing on the HA's books.)
14.      The financial results have been conservatively estimated but still
require very good future performance from the management and staff of the
Housing Authority to produce in time the financial soundness needed by the HA.
It is clear from these projections that the capital base of the institution
must be strengthened. Commitments have already been made by the Ministry of



ANNEX 2
-  61  -                             Page 6
Finance of a F$1 million capital infusion into the HA by March 1989. Through
careful planning, additional capital will not be required for several years.
15.      In restructuring the HA, every effort has been made to limit the
amount, and to spread the timing, of the infusion of new funds both to mini-
mize the budgetary effect and to permit assessment of the future performance
of HA management and make such revision as is necessary. But it is unfortu-
nately inescapable that Government funds be spent given the current circum-
stances of the housing program and HA. Hence, in 1991, an additional F$1
million will be needed from Government as an equity injection to Housing Auth-
ority. This will be followed by an additional F$1 million in 1992 and F$2
million in 1993. After that, the HA will be and remain financially self-suf-
ficient.
Conclusion
16.      The plan presented in this memorandum will pave the way for the pro-
posed World Bank/Asian Development Bank loan of F$45.5 million to house 5,000
families and develop 3,000 new housing lots. Current and future home owners
will have greater freedom to enjoy home ownership. They will be at liberty to
rent part of their homes to others thus opening up supply of affordable rental
housing.
17.      The Authority will change from a social welfare regulatory agency to
a housing production and financing agency. It will be dedicated to serving
the needs of the truly low income sector of the population by producing
affordable housing and mortgage finance.
18.      The Ministry of Finance and Attorney General Chambers have been con-
sulted on this Memorandum. Their respective views and comments on it have
been noted.
19.      Cabinet is invited to:
(a) agree that the Housing Authority Rental Program be transferred to a
separate Bcard as detailed in Appendix 2;
(b) agree with the new Housing Authority Policy Statement as outlined in
Appendix 3; and
(c)  approve the equity injection of F$4 million by the Government between
1991 and 1993.

HOUSING PROJECT
Fiji Housing Authority
Policy Statement 1/
Objective
1.       The purpose of the Housing Authority is to produce and finance
through long-term mortgages, shelter for families who would not otherwise have
available to them the kinds of living accommodations they would both desire
and afford. HA neither produces nor administers rental flats requiring con-
struction and or operational subsidies.
General Policies
Target Beneficiary Group
2.       HA will operate in such a manner as to serve families whose total
family income falls between the 20th and 80th deciles of the national distri-
bution of family income as determined by official Government statistics. Both
urban and village families will be served; differences in the family income
distribution for these two segments will be respected. Shelter production and
mortgage finance will be made available in proportion to the numbers of fami-
lies in the income decile and their ethnic composition.
3.       HA will operate in such a manner as to serve families whose total
family income falls between the 20th and 80th deciles of the national distri-
bution of family income as determined by official Government statistics.
However, for the purpose of determining the loan eligibility of a family only
income of those members who would own the property jointly shall be taken into
account. Both urban village families will be served; differences in the fam-
ily income distribution for these two segments will be respected. Shelter
production and mortgage finance will be made available in proportion to the
numbers of families in the income decile and their ethnic composition. For
the purpose of determining the eligibility the income of the head of house-
hold, spouse and a maximum of two adult children living at home shall be taken
into account.
Financial Self-Sufficiency
4.       HA will operate on a fully "self-sufficient" basis without Government
subsidies. While it will not seek profit for the "sake of profit", it is
required to be financially viable, including: ensuring the full recovery of
all direct and indirect costs; maintaining adequate levels of liquidity,
1/ This policy statement was adopted by the HA Board of Directors
August 15, 1988 and was endorsed by the GOF Cabinet in November 1988.



ANNEX 3
-  63  -                            Page 2
interest/debt service coverage, and reserves for losses; preserving its capi-
tal base to meet the housing needs of future generations. HA is committed to
the vigorous pursuit of mortgage payments due to it and will take prompt legal
action against accounts in default.
Products and Services
5.       HA will concentrate on producing serviced sites in sizes and at costs
affordable by population segment it serves, along with upgrading substandard
communities when the community so requests, and financing mortgages for new
lots and houses. It is committed to being an efficient producer of shelter
and financing. However, greater emphasis shall be placed on new lots and
houses.
Coordination with Other Authorities
6.       HA will work closely and cooperatively with zoning and other regula-
tory agencies to ensure that the standards set allow the provision of afford-
able shelter to all members of its target beneficiary group and will coordi-
nate its site development with PWD, FEA, NLTB/NLDC, TCPD, MHUD and local
authorities.
Deregulation
7.       HA will establish mortgage covenants to ensure that its mortgages are
secure and that its target group of families benefit from its products and
services, but will otherwise be guided by the principles that purchasers of
its properties: are free to enjoy and use their property as they please; have
the duty singly and collectively to care for their property including "commu-
nal" land; and are subject to the regulations established by national and
local authorities. HA will not provide services or substitute its own regula-
tions for those of other authorities or- home-owner associations. Should its
mortgage covenants be violated, HA will seek remedies through the courts.
Shelter Production
8.       HA produced subdivisions will be designed and managed from inception
to the final sale of all lots under the authority and responsibility of a
"Project Manager", who reports to the Director, Housing & Development, and
ensures that:
(a) costs of :Lots offered for sale are affordable and desirable by its
target group of beneficiaries in proportion to their representation
in the population as a whole, varying standards to attain affordabil-
ity;
(b) adequate and affordable provisions are made for and agreed by any
squatters on the land before land acquisition or development begins;
(c) electricity, water and sewerage will be available on time to allow
the prompt sale and occupation of lots as they are developed;



-  64  -                            ANNEX 3
Page 3
(d)  after the last lots are sold, local government arrangements,
including owner associations, will be available to provide for
communal needs and services;
(e)  due consideration is given to transportation and access to work,
stores and services in choosing sites;
(f)  due consideration is given to the health and environmental concerns
of the Nation;
(g)  industrial and commercial sites may be developed in conjunction with
residential lot development and land may be set aside for play-
grounds, churches and other communal needs;
Mortgage Financing
Eligibility
9.       Mortgage financing will be available to all citizens who meet HA's
family income and credit standards eligibility standards, which shall be pub-
licly available, for the purpose of purchasing a single-family, owner occupied
residence. Should mortgage funds be scarce, first preference will be given to
lots being offered for sale by HA. Industrial/Commercial sites are sold for
cash or short-term notes.
Allocation of Mortgages
10.      Mortgage loans and property sales will be allocated from chronologi-
cal order waiting lists established for that purpose, maintaining an ethnic
balance in the allocation sequence. Applicants are free to specify where they
wish to purchase subject to ability to pay. Credit and income eligibility
will be determined prior to being placed on the waiting list.
Security
11.      Individual loans made will be secured by a first mortgage on the
property and such other security as may be specified from time to time and
case-to-case. Village Loans will be secured by ground rent liens administered
by NLTB and other acceptable securities.
Rate and Term
12.      Loans will carry an interest rate set by HA at the time the mortgage
is originated based upon its current marginal cost of funds and lending
spread. The Authority will have the right to adjust its rates periodically
based on changes to its weighted average cost of funds within limits setting
the annual and life-of-mortgage adjustments which may be made, which are also
set at the time of mortgage origination. Maximum mortgage term will be 25
years. Applicant age, type of shelter and the conditions may result in a
lesser period.



ANNEX 3
-  65  -                            Page 4
Rate Adjustments
13.      Every six rmonths Management shall automatically adjust mortgage rates
up or down--based oni the weighted average cost of funds to HA for the past six
months. Old mortgages will be brought to current standards through maximum
allowable adjustments every six months. Mortgagors will be promptly notified
by mail and through publication in the local media of the adjustment, includ-
ing notification of no change in the lending rate.
Credit Standards
14.      Applicant family income and ability to pay will determine the size of
loan a family is eligible for. Family credit obligations in excess of one
year will be deducted before computing family income to determine the amount
of loan eligibility. No more than one-third of the remainder may be allocated
to mortgage payments to determine maximum eligibility after down payments.
Closing costs may be charged to the loan. Credit applications will contain
affidavits certifyin,g the statements thereon are true, that no other residence
is owned and that the applicant intends to occupy and use the property as a
permanent home. Legal remedies will be sought when false affidavits are dis-
covered. Graduated rate mortgages and "lballoon" payments will not be used.
Payments
15.      Level monthly payments will be called for in all mortgage contracts.
Payments received 15 days or more late will be assessed penalty interest
monthly at the rate of 0.5% a month until brought current. Accounts in
arrears 30 days will receive notices by mail of possible default; accounts 60
days in arrears will be contacted in person or by telephone; accounts in
arrears 90 days or more where no work-oul: has been agreed to will be consid-
ered in default and legal action institut:ed to repossess the property.
Finance and Administration
Financial Planning
16.      In November of each year the CE will recommend to the Board the oper-
ational plan and budget for the next year. These recommendations, in such
manner and detail as prescribed by the Board, will be supported by a five-year
financial projection, prepared by the management, and indicating clearly the
assumptions and policies used to make the forecast, highlighting where changes
to previous year assumptions and policies used. In reviewing the budget,
operating plan and financial projections, HA's financial and policy assump-
tions will also be reviewed and confirmed or modified by the Board, including
inter alia, the lending spread for the next twelve months.
Financial Objectives
17.      In its planning and administration of HA, Management is directed to
produce, maintain and/or observe the following standards:



-  66  -                           ANNEX 3
Page 5
(a)  Accounts in arrears 180+ days:      2Z of accounts.
(b)  Provisions for Doubtful Debts:      1Z of the net value of outstanding
loans
(c)  Debt/Equity Ratio:                  10:1
(d)  Current Ratio:                      1.5:1
(e)  Interest Service Ratio:             1.5:1
(f)  Debt Service Ratio:                 2:1
(g)  Lending Spread:                     = all noncapital admin. and opera-
tional costs
(h)  Current Lending Rate:               weighted average cost of past 6
months of long-term borrowings
plus spread.
(i)  Lending rate adjustments:           +/- 1% p.a. or 5Z over life of
mortgage
(j)  Down Payments                       Min. 1OZ of selling price
Selling Price Mark-up
18.      The books of the Authority will be maintained in such a manner as to
identify the full direct and indirect costs of properties sold. This cost
will be set annually by the Board at the time of the approval of the budget
and plan. The mark-up will be set to: fund reserves, maintain ratio stan-
dards, and preserve capital in real terms. Management will propose the mark-
up to the Board as part of the annual budget and plan against the longer term
context of the five year financial forecast. Management is granted flexibil-
ity to apply the mark-up differently to classes of property, particularly to
maintain affordability for the lowest income group served by HA. Industrial/
Commercial sites are to be offered on tender to the highest bidder as a cash
or near cash sale. Any residential, industrial or commercial property offered
for sale at a price below full cost requires prior Board notification.
Borrowing
19.      HA seeks to match maturity and rate in its lending and borrowing
portfolios to the maximum extent possible and to diversify its sources of
finance. Except during times of unusually high interest rates and with the
approval of the Board, HA will not borrow at maturities less than ten years to
fund its mortgage portfolio. Construction loans may be borrowed short term.
Long-term borrowings at fixed rates are to be committed to fixed rate mort-
gages for the same maturity whenever possible. Adjustable rate borrowings
will always be loaned at adjustable rates.
Delegation to CE
20.      Policy making is exclusive right of the Board.  The CE is authorized
to carry out the plans and policies approved by the Board subject to the fol-
lowing restrictions and conditions:
(a) Construction and/or land acquisition contracts in excess of F$150,000
require the Board's prior approval.



-  67   -                            ANNEX 3

(b) Vacancies: in managerial positions reporting to the CE are not to be
filled on a permanent or acting basis without the prior approval of
the Board.
(c)  The Board is to be notified promptly if any events beyond manage-
ment's control will prevent the fulfillment of the approved annual
plan or realization of its finLancial objectives.
(d)  Management is to report monthLy to the Board current operating and
financial results consistent with the format and manner in which the
annual plan was presented to and approved by the Board.

Recommendations for Restructuring of Rental Housing Program 1/
1.       The public rental housing program has done good work in the past but
is not financially viable nor sustainable under the present policy constraints
and funding. The main impediments to continuing to operate rental housing
are:
(a) Rent controls by government directives forcing uneconomic rents to be
retained;
(b) Misguided social welfare constraints on the Authority which since
1974, has had to suffer the losses of income incurred by the Govern-
ment's instruction that the maximum rent it can charge must not be
greater than 152 of the nominated tenant's income;
(c) Inequities in rent setting policies unrelated to household incomes;
(d) Inadequate support with land, grants and sufficiently favorable loans
by government.
(e) This inadequacy in financial support for rental housing has forced
the Authority into nonsustainable debt servicing in its attempts to
meet government's housing targets.
2.       The Authority is expected to make a F$2.1 million deficit in its
rental operations in 1988. Any continuation of such losses is likely to crip-
ple the whole Authority preventing it from continuing most of its operations,
at great loss to the community.
3.       There is always likely to be a need for government-assisted rental
housing but, at this point in time, while maintaining the rental housing pro-
gram, there should be a marked change of strategy towards promoting more home
ownership and self-help building; promoting a greater role for the private
sector in both housing development and private renting; and liberalizing the
planning and building standards to increase residential land-use densities and
make better use of urban resources.
4.       There is a need for the rental housing operations to be separated
financially and clearly from the rest of the operations of the Authority so as
not to mask the true cost of the rental program, nor to prevent the Authority
from continuing its other functions of providing housing loans and homes for
sale to low-income workers; and so as to be separately accountable to the
1/ Extract from A Review of the Rental Housing Program of the Fiji Housing
Authority by Allen Crosby for the Asian Development Bank, August 1988.



ANNEX 4
-  69  -                            Page 2
Government to enable management to be dedicated to, and responsible for, this
financially vulnerable operation.
5.       Recommendations for the short term include:
(a) Immediate transfer of all assets, liabilities and responsibilities of
the rental operations from the Authority to a separate Public Rental
Housing Trust to maintain separate and clearly identifiable accounts,
for separate accountability, and to restore and public rental opera-
tions to a financially sound and sustainable basis;
(b) Remove all rent controls to allow progressive restoration of rents
for public rental housing to more viable levels and to encourage the
private sector to provide more rental accommodation;
(c)  Change the basis of calculating rent from the tenants income to the
combined income of all adult members of the tenants' household,
thereby greatly increasing the source of revenue and removing many
current social inequities; and
(d)  Institute a system of financial incentives (that is:  discounts) and
penalties to accelerate the recovery of rent arrears and to increase
the yield.
6.       Recommendations for the medium to long term include:
(a) Transfer the responsibility for determining affordability and for
allocating all subsidies for rents to the Social Welfare Department
so that the Authority can concentrate on the efficient supply of
housing to the largest number of people on low incomes as resources
permit on a sustainable basis;
(b) Change the policy of restricting Authority rents to a maximum of 152
of the tenant's income to allow at least economic rent (that is full
cost recovery) to be charged in all cases;
(c) Progressively and regularly increase rents to more realistic levels
so that aLl tenants who have occupied their subsidized rental flats
for ten years or more should be charged a fair market rent unless the
Director of Social Welfare recommends that there are special circum-
stances of hardship or of a humanitarian nature for not doing so;
(d) Formulate and implement a firm program to sell or lease between 40Z
to 602 of the existing public rental flats over the next 10 years to
improve the cash flow of the rental operations; encourage the pur-
chase of homes; turn over the stock; and to reduce maintenance and
administration costs;
(e) Promote the private sector more in producing houses, flats and board-
ing houses for sale and rent; and



-  70  -                            ANNEX 4
Page 3
(f) Create more enlightened local and regional authorities in the main
urban areas and liberalize the planning and building regulations to
encourage greater land-use densities; more in-filling on existing
urban land; building additional units or separate "Granny Flats" for
relatives on existing lost and make better use of existing urban
resources/infrastructure.

HOUSING PROJECT
Draft Policy Statement for the Public Rental Board
A. Introduction
1.       The Public Rental Board (PRB) was established on May 16, 1989 as part
of the revitalization of the nation's public housing program. PRB will
restructure the finances and service levels of the current rental housing
program in order to:
(a) reduce its excessively high costs which require significant govern-
mental subsidies at this time;
(b) ensure that benefits from government expenditures reach intended
beneficiaries'
(c)  eliminate rent subsidies for families who have the means to pay a
fair market rent.
2.       This is an interim policy state!ment.  On or before the end of 1991,
the Board will make formal recommendations to the Minister of Housing and
Urban Development as to the long term future of government-operated rental
housing in the nation. In administering the existing rental flats, in
restructuring the program and in formulating recommendations for the future,
the Public Rental Board will work closely with the Housing Authority Board.
B. Guiding Principles
3.       In restructuring and administering the public rental program, the
Board shall:
(a) treat current occupants of PRB properties fairly and equitably;
(b) foster home ownership on the part of all wage earners;
(c)  stimulate and support private rental accommodation initiatives;
(d) cooperate with the Department of Social Welfare to house wage earners
temporarily in need of financial assistance for housing, and
(e)  seek to eliminate the need for government subsidies to the PRB.
C. Program Restructuring
4.       The government seeks to have affordable housing available for all who
seek it without subsidy, and recognizes that the current manner in which the
rental housing program is operated falls far short of attaining this objec-
tive.  The prime restructuring goal is to ensure that government expenditures



ANNEX 5
-  72  -                            Page 2
on housing serve the needs of all low income wage earners in the long run, are
affordable both by Government and the homeowner or renter and provide good
value for cost. The Board is approaching the matter of restructuring the
rental housing program in a learning mode. Initially the PRB will proceed to
develop plans and begin implementation along the following lines, making
adjustments promptly as experience is gained.
Sale of Selected Rental Flats
5.       The high overall cost of the rental program is disproportionately
influenced by approximately 40X of the rental units where financial charges
and other costs are well above the rents that the PRB can charge. These flats
will be sold at a fair market price as soon as possible. Sitting tenants will
be given first right of purchase with certain allowances made for past rents
paid. If the sitting tenant cannot, or will not, purchase the property, it
will be offered for sale on the open market. Tenants displaced from their
flats through such sales will be granted priority rights to other flats as
they come available or to the purchase of less expensive sites from the HA.
Rental Charges
6.       Future rental charges for all PRB properties will be at a level
whereby all direct and indirect operating costs of the Board will be recouped
on an annual basis. Rents will be increased for sitting tenants to the requi-
site level for sustainable operations. This may involve a transitional period
of progressive rent increases. Where existing or future tenants cannot afford
to pay the rent charged due to low family income, they will be assisted by the
Department of Social Welfare which will make up the difference through direct
payment to the PRB.
Rent Collections
7.       The PRB will diligently collect all past and current rent due.
Action will be promptly taken to evict tenants who fall behind in their rent
payments in excess of 90 days.
Flat Allocation Criteria and Occupancy Time Limits
8.       PRB will have a review made of the current criteria for allocating
vacant units in cooperation with the Department of Social Welfare. A review
will also be made of the length of occupancy of rental units by the current
tenants and proposals made to set limits on the length of time a family may
occupy a government-owned rental flat, along with the relationship of length
of occupancy to the rent to be charged to the occupant. Recommendations
emerging from these reviews will be made to the Board for its consideration
and action.
Rehabilitation/Construction
9.       A review will be made of the need to rehabilitate existing or con-
struct new rental flats and proposals made to the Board on these matters.



ANNEX 5
-      -                             Page 3
Community Involvement
10.      Through their representatives, current tenants and other interested
parties will be invited to discuss and make recommendations to shape the poli-
cies and practices being adopted by the PRB and to help develop the future
direction of government assisted housing in the country.
D. Operations
11.      Subject to any changes which may be decided upon as a result of the
review of allocation criteria and length of occupancy policy mentioned above
the policies, procedures and practices for the operation of existing rental
flats previously followed in the Housing Authority will be continued in the
PRb without change. Current staff of the Housing Authority working full time
on the rental housing program will be transferred to the PRB with no loss in
pay, status or benefits as a result of the transfer. The Housing Authority
will provide accounting, treasury, data processing, internal auditing, person-
nel, public relations, administrative and other supporting services to the
PRB. A fee, to be negotiated by the Boards of the HA and the PRB with the
concurrence of tbhe Ministries of Finance and Housing, will be paid by the PRB
to the HA for services rendered.
E. Finance and Management
12.      Two months before the start of each fiscal year, PRB staff will rec-
ommend to the Board the operational plan and budget. These recommendations
will be supported by a five-year financial projection prepared by management
and indicating clearly the assumptions and policies used to make the forecast,
highlighting the key variables and the degree of uncertainty attached to them.
Since the PRB is so heavily dependent upon subsidies from the regular govern-
mental budget (or government-guaranteed borrowing authority), the operational
plan, budget and five-year forecast is to be developed in consultation with
the MOF Budget Department and MOF views are to be made known to the Board when
it receives Management's recommendations.
F. Audit
13.      An initial audit of the HA's books to determine the appropriate open-
ing financial statements of the PRB shall be carried out immediately by an
independent, FIA-member auditor selected jointly by the Board of the HA and
the PRB. The firm selected for the initial audit shall be retained by the PRB
as an external auciitor.

HOUSING PROJECT
Planning Criteria and Design Standards
Selection Criteria
1.       The project areas were selected initially on the basis of preliminary
demand estimates and an analysis of the application backlogs for house rentals
compiled by HA. The selection of the project areas is also consistent with
the national urban development trends identified by the government. Site
selection criteria included the following, namely, affordable land costs,
marketability, closeness to employment opportunities, easy access and availa-
bility of affordable transportation, suitable physical conditions including
topography and minimal flooding, minimal off-site infrastructure needs (water
and supply, for example). The major features of the previously identified 11
sites are summarized in Annex 7. Land for these sites has been already
acquired by HA. About 6 sites would require in-situ accommodation of a total
of about 380 squatters for which satisfactory arrangements are being made by
HA (see attached Appendix).
Site Planning and Infrastructure Design
2.       The standards and criteria are sufficiently flexible to allow for
variations in the topography, economy in infrastructure construction, cultural
conditions and availability of local building materials. To permit the use of
low-cost designs which depart from the traditional costly standards, agree-
ments were reached with TCPD to relax requirements regarding lot sizes, set-
backs, road widths and road paving standards. Revised design standards thus
include the following smaller plot sizes (starting from 203 m2) allowing
higher density neighborhood clusters (as high as 31 dwellings/ha), 6 m wide
roads instead of 9 m wide roads as the minimum size, unsealed roads instead of
tar-sealed, narrower one-way vehicle access loops and improved footpath circu-
lation. The process of refining the site-specific standards was iterative in
order to be able to match the physical standards with the income distribution
and affordability limits of the beneficiaries.
3.       Layout designs typically permit 78Z residential usage, 13Z circula-
tion usage and lO  community/commercial usage.   The need for and the portion
of the site area allocated for commercial areas, schools, playgrounds and
other community facilities varies widely from site to site, depending on the
existence of these facilities in the immediate vicinity. (Following the cur-
rent practice, in several subdivisions, the schools will be provided by the
local religious institutions and private groups according to standards estab-
lished by the Ministry of Education). Site development will include site
preparation, and provision of infrastructure--both off-site and on-site--for
roads, water, sewerage, drainage and electricity.



-  81  -                             ANNEX 9
Page 2
4.       Plot sizes and the distribution of plots for the project are deter-
mined on the basis of available income distribution data and the target popu-
lation with incomes within the 13th to the 70th percentiles. For each site
scheme, the proportiLon of beneficiaries of each income decile would generally
correspond to the national urban income distribution and the types of plots
would also reflect this distribution.
5.       As Annex 7 indicates, the off-site infrastructure requirements are
minimal, particularly for water and sewerage. For example, the sites located
in the Suva-Nausori corridor will be served with adequate water and sewerage
through the existing trunk infrastructure or planned construction of such
facilities under the! ongoing PWD schemes financed by the Australian Aid Pro-
gram. Off-site water reticulation for the Tavakubu site in the Lautoka area
will however require careful planning in view of the extremely undulating
topography (29 m to 120 m) of the site. The phasing of Tavakubu II and III
takes this into account. While trucked garbage collection is not of concern
at most sites, off-site landfill disposal facilities for the Suva-Nausori
corridor have only limited handling capacity, a problem which is currently
under study by the Japanese government. This situation will be carefully
monitored during the project implementation phase.
Superstructure Design
6.       While the project is limited to the provision of serviced plots and
building loans, it takes into account the development of alternative super-
structure designs to suit the affordability criteria for the target popula-
tion. The affordability studies cover a range of housing options--from a
'temporary basic shelter" to permanent concrete block structures, including a
shell-type incremental structure in timber. (See Annex 11 for affordability
details). The incremental core house concept which is hitherto untested in
Fiji is also reflected in the stated options. Illustrative prototypes of the
various options are presented in Drawings 43470:1-3 and briefly described
below:
(a)  The basic shelter, an informal structure, is intended as a temporary
measure while permanent accommodation is being built either in
stages, or as a complete unit. However, it includes permanent sani-
tary connections as required by the Central Board of Health.
(b) The incremeintal form of dwelling is evolved from a core (WBlO--area
2.3 m2) consisting of toilet, shower and wash basin which would be
supplemented by a basic shelter or other informal temporary struc-
ture. Type WB20 (area 9 m2) is the basic core plus a covered living
area. This may or may not be supplemented by a basic shelter. Type
WB30 (area 15 m2) is a one-room addition to WB20. A two-room exten-
sion to this; forms Type WB60A (area 27 m2) which is a two bedroom
completed dwrelling which can be further extended into a three bedroom
house (WB60B--area--40 m2).
(c)  The shell house (area--20 m2) has a conical roof supported on four
timber columns. Initially the initerior is undivided except for the
enclosing walls of the toilet and shower.

Page 3
(d) These designs are intended to illustrate the expansion process to
guide potential builders and owners, and to test affordability. HA
clients are free to adopt their own designs. It is intended that the
structural detailing of all units should be such as to enable them to
be self built, and that a completed dwelling should be capable of
being built progressively from a core with the minimum of disturbance
to each stage.
7.       All solutions, including the basic (temporary) shelter using nonper-
manent building materials, have been approved by the Board of Health, the
building code enforcement authority, relaxing the existing building standards.
The design and costing of the building options meet cyclone resistance
requirements. A separate study will be undertaken under the proposed project
to help draft a building code that rationalizes standards and procedures rela-
ted to cyclone resistance requirements. The drafting of a new South Pacific
regional building code has been undertaken with AIDAB assistance. HA is a
member of the drafting committee in Fiji and in this capacity serves as an
advocate of low-cost shelter design.

PROCEDURES FOR ACCOMMODATING SQUATTERS ON HOUSING
AUTHORITY DEVELOPMENT SITES
When the Housing Authority obtains land for development on which squatters
have established themselves, the following procedures are used.
1. Survey information of the site is obtained identifying existing
structures. Aerial photography is used to draw site plan of existing
conditions.
2.  An income/eligibility survey is carried out and in the process,
squatter shacks are marked so that no 'new' squatters take advantage of
3 below.
3.  The squatters are offered first priority to purchase lots in the new
subdivisions.
4. Information from 1 and 2 above determines which structures are to be
preserved and incorporated in the design of the subdivision.
5. The Authority's Resettlement Office assists the squatters to move their
shacks within the site, in cases where they would interfere with
construction work, or finds alternative temporary accommodation.l/
6.  Where squatters need temporarily to be relocated elsewhere they are
granted a 'Resettlement Cost'. This cost is worked out after a
'removal valuation' is done based on the size and condition of the
squatter house.
In temporary relocation centers the Authority arranges and pays for
communal water supplies.
7. Upon completion of site works, squatters purchase plots with HA
financing like other HA clients. In those cases where the squatters'
income is insufficient to purchase a plot,2/ HA assists the squatter
in making contract with charitable organizations for assistance in
purchasing the plot or with service organizations (such as HART) for
alternative accommodation.
1/  It has normally transpired that the squatters are willing to cooperate
with the Authority but there have been cases where the squatters bring
court injunctions against the deveLopment which then require resolution
in the courts. Instances of this have arisen from disputes on
landownership when a squatter feels that he has a claim to the land.
In such cases, HA works through the courts. If the issue cannot be
satisfactorily resolved in the courts or if the case entails an
excessive delay, HA is free to drop the site from its development
program and acquire a replacement site.
2/ According to HA there are few such cases.
