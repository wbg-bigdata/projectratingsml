NORTHEAST InRICATION PROJECT II
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the project completion report (PCi) for Thailand's Northeast
Irrigation Project II for which a loan of US$17.5 million (1630-TN) was signed
on December 4, 1978. The project was jointly financed with the International
Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) (Loan STHA), also for US$17.5 mil-
lion. The project was completed in September 1985 and the loan was closed on
March 31, 1986.
The PCR was prepared by the East Asia t.nd Pacific Regional Office,
Bangkok from data and reports provided by the Royal Irrigation Department
(RID) and a completion mission by Messrs. T.E. Davis, Y. Wong (Bank),
T. Lohavisavapanich (FAO/CP), and E. Senior (Consultant). Other sources of
information were: Appraisal Report No. 1901-TH dated October 17, 1978,
Project Loan Agreement No. 1630-IA dated December 4, 1978; Project Performance
Audit Report Northeast Irrigation Improvement Project OED Report No. 4203
dated November 29, 1982; supervision reports; correspondence with the
Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda. The conclusions and evaluation summary
were prepared by Agriculture Division 2 East Asia Pacific Project Dapartment
staff.
The PCR was sent to the Borrower and cofinanciers on September 15,
1988. The Office of the Auditor General has sent in response a copy of their
Comments and Recommendations on the project, which is reproduced in Annex I.
Comments received from the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives also appear
in Annex I.
The project has not been audited by OED but, together with the
Northeast Irrigation I project, is the subject of an impact evaluation cur-
rently underway by OED.

NORTHEAST IRRICATION PROJECT II (Loan 1630-TH)
Project Completion Report
Evaluation Sui ary
Introduction and Objectives
i.        The Project was expected to:  increase vet season rice yields and
expand cultivation of paddy and irrigated upland crops in the dry season;
complete the irrigation system for the Lam Pao project area (31,550 ha) begun
under the Northeast Irrigation Improvement Project (Stage I) Cr. 461-TH; and
to construct two diversion dams to enable the existing Lam Takhong dam to
develop delivery systems for 19,700 ha. The project was also expected to
improve the economic status of the Northeast Region a  , more directly, the
21,000 farm families in the command area (para. 2.5)._
Implementation Experience
ii.       The Royal Irrigation Department (RID) force account works began in
January 1980 and were 90% complete by the closing date. In addition seventeen
LCB contracts were completed in 69 months (66 months projected at appraisal)
and all main canals, laterals, diversion dams and Lam Pao rehabilitation were
accomplished largely as projected in the staff appraisal report (SAR)
(para. 3.:'). The total service area of both dams was reduced from 51,250 ha
to about 4b,000 ha served by tertiaries.
Results
iii.      Tertiaries and farm turnouts have been developed but have not been
fully tested during a Jr- season. The appraisal design standard for 58%
overall water utilizationi efficiency was unrealistic in light of experience
under Stage I (paras. 3.7-3.9) and actual efficiency is estimated at 30%.
Although RID established an Inspection Committee to improve design and to
simplify operation and maintenance; the length of tertiary canals, lack of
control structures, seepage losses, and poor canal maintenance makes equitable
water distribution and high efficiency difficult. Damage due to overtopping
of canals and structures occurred during intense rainfall and additional
wasteways may be required (para. 3.13).
iv.       Demands for dry season cropping exceed system delivery capability
which is also affected by water storage limitations. The capacity of the Lam
Pao Dam (built in 1968) has been reduced from 1,260 MCM to 900 MCM
1/   All paragraph references ir the evaluation summary are to the PCR.



v 
(para. 3.10) by failure of the mechanism controlling spillway gates and the
occurrence of a "wet spot" in the dam. RID decided not to repair the gates
and "vet spot" however, in view of the present system delivery efficiency dry-
season service areas at Lam Pao are now limited to about 23,200 ha;
approximately 481 of Stage I and II total com_and area. Water was delivered
to the are in the 1985 wet season, but 1986 dry season deliveties were
affected by limited water supply and lateral capacity.  At Lam Takhong, dry
season water in 1985 and 1986 was only sufficient for 2,500 ha (target
4,400 ha) because wet-season irrigation requires annual runoff and 861 of the
reservoir's total capacity. Changes in the operating procedure and reservoir
mar3gement for both the Lam Pao and Lam Takhong systems are proposed
(pares. 3.9-3.11).
v.        RID's responsibilities for operation and maintenance are upstream of
the off-takes which service the tertiary system. Farmer-water user groups
(WUG) are responsible for cleaning and maintenance of the tertiary system.
About 467 WUG have been organised but 750 more are needed and performance is
below par (paras. 3.14 and 6.7).
vi.       In the 1985 wet season 48,800 ha of paddy yielded 3.4 ton/ha and 2.9
ton/ha in the Lam Pao and Lam Takhong areas, respectively. At full develop-
ment paddy yields are expected to be 3.8 ton/ha (paras. 4.5-4.7). With limi-
ted water for about 23,200 ha of dry-season cropping (see para. iv) cropping
intensity at Lam Pao is expected to be 146% compared to projected 160Z at
appraisal. In Lam Takhong full-development cropping intensity of 125% is
expected, similar to appraisal estimates.  Dry-season cropping patterns (Lam
Pao 35% paddy 65% upland crops; Lam Takhong 50% paddy and 50% upland) may have
to be revised in view of limited water supplies, delivery cap'city, market
demands and farmer response (para. 4.4). Until farmers havy, more confidence
in dry season water delivery, the use of fertilizers, agricultural chemicals
and broadcast seeding of paddy and more intense production of upland crops
will lag.
Sustainability
vii.      Shortcomings coomon to other projects implemented by RID include:
failure zo improve design criteria (paras. 3.4 and 3.7); delays in awarding
contracts (para. 3.6); and insufficient funding and staff for OM (para.
3.14). The early formation of water users groups (paras. 6.2 and 6.7) and
better communication with other agencies, market, supply and credit
organizations would have helped. The performance of the consultant appointed
ur4er the project to assist in design and implementation was satisfactory
para. 6.4). The Bank was attentive in monitorirg physical achievements but
failed to obtain improvement in RID provision for O&M (para. 6.9).
Findings and Lessons
viii.          The project has been successful in potent.ally providing dry-
season irrigation fe 23,500 ha and supplemental wet-season irrigation for
about 46,000 ha at Lam Pao. It is estimated that about 20,000 farm families
will obtain direct benefits through the incremental production of paddy,
peanuts and mungbeans. The re-estimated ERR is 11% against the appraisal



vi -
target of 252, largely due to lover projected rice prices, reduction in
expected dry season irrigation and cost overruns.
ix.       The principal lessons learned ares
(a)  The effect of project desi* on operation and mintenance.  In an
OPD 1981 study o/ water managemnt in Bank Supporte4 Irrigation
Project Syste I _ it was concluded that project oerformnce had
been affected by inadequate attention to O&K dut  a p 0praisal,
design and implementation. This Stage-II project attempted to
improve these conditions by charging the Inspection Comittee to
make a special effort to improve system designs. Unfortunately few
improvements took place a-id overall conveyance efficiency is likely
to be the sam (302) as in Stage I (para. 3.7).
(b) Water User Groups. O&M of tertiary canals was expected to be the
responsibility of farmer groups to be organized along each canal
(paras. 3.8-3.9 and 6.9). Reasons for the failure of WUG include
(i) lack of sufficient training and guidance, especially for group
leaders, (ii) excessive group size and conflicting interests among
members, (iii) the absence of DAE- or RID-conducted water-user
training and (iv) a legal basis for RID collection of water charges
or enforcement of water use discipline.

the Northeast. The project was intended to contribute to an ongoing
government program to increase wet-season rice yields and expand cultivation
of rice and upland crops in the dry season. It was also seen as an important
contribution to government attempts to derelop the economic status of the
Northeast Region, where per capita incomes were, and remain, only about one
half the national average. The project was prepared as a follow-up to the
first Bank-financed Northeast Thailand Irrigation Improvement Project (Cr.
461-TH). It was designed to complete the irrigation system development for
31,550 ha of the Lam Pao project area begun under the first (Stage I) project
and to develop main through tertiary service for 19,700 ha below the existing
Lam Takhong Dam.
II. PROJECT ORIGIN AND DESCRIPTION
2.1       Most of the irrigable areas in Thailand are in the flood plains of
the major rivers where heavy rainfall and flooding preclude the cultivation of
crops other than paddy in the wet season. In the Chao Phya Plain, clay soils
predominate and paddy is the preferred crop  n the dry season as well.  The
situation is similar in the coastal plains of the South. Dry-season cropping
is more diversified on the alluvial soils of the Northern Region, and in the
areas developed for irrigation in the Northeast. In the 1976 wet seaso-., the
harvested area of rice was about 7.7 million ha, of which the irrigated areas
accounted for some 1.8 million ha. Close to 0.4 million ha of rice were
irrigated in the dry season. Since virtually ell land suitable for rice was
cultivated in the wet season, any major gains in rice production would have to
come from higher yields and increases in the area cropped in dry season. To
meet increased domestic and international demand for rice, the Covernment
estimated that Thailand's production would ha~-- to increase from 15.1 million
tons of paddy in 1976 to 22.7 million tons in 1990. Even assuming an average
20% rainfed yield increase, paddy proaucticn ih irrigated areas would have to
more than double to meet this target. This would require the use of higher-
yielding varieties which in turn depend on more reliable water and improved
cultivation techniques.
2.2       Sinct its formation in 1904, the Royal Irrigation Department (RID)
has constructed irrigation, flood control and navigation systems which now
benefit nearly 2.5 million hectarec.  Early irrigation development was



- 2 -
characterized by an extensive approach simed at modifying natural flood
regimes over large tracts of land. This method, which was appropriate to the
vast flat Chao Phya plain, was applied with less success in the Northeast
where the irregular terrain precludes flood irrigation except in the narrow
river valleys. Furthermore, the circumstances that favored this extensive
app: oach changed. Improved agricultural techniques became available and price
ratios offered incentives for farmers to adopt higher standards of on-farm
development. Thus, future exploitation of Thailand's irrigation potenti&L
would require more emphasis on reliable and timely delivery of water to
farmers' fields, involving upgrading of virtually all of the existing irriga-
tion systems, and incorporating higher standards of water control in the
expansion of existing systems and in new projects. Projects undertaken after
1973 incorporated higher standards of water control, by including land
levelling and on-form development.
2.3       Storage dams are essential to irrigation in the Northeast.  During
the dry season, the flow in all except the lower reaches of the larger rivers
virtually ceases. In the wet season, river flows vary in accordance with
rainfall, with sharp recessions in flow during drought periods. Run-off per
sq km is much lower than in the Northern and Southern regions, and the
potential for year-round irrigation is limited to about 300,000 ha or some 10%
of the region's total paddy area. By the mid-19709, about 30,000 ha benefited
from wet-season irrigation and about 8,000 ha were irrigated in the dry
season. At that time there existed 6 large reservoirs with capacity to
irrigate about 160,000 ha. However, the area receiving reliable and timely
irrigation was far less because of technical deficiencies in the canal
systems.
2.4       From 1950 to 1976, the Bank assisted in financing nine irrigation
projects and one multipurpose project, for a total of US$297.1 million in
loans and credits. Nine of these were for the development of irrigation in
the central plain, and one for the improvement of irrigation in the Northeas:
region. The Norchc -t Irrigation Improvement Project to support effective use
of existing irrigation facilities in the Northeast was initiated in 1974 with
Bank assistance (Cr. 461-TH). This project upgraded and completed irrigation
works serving 38,600 ha in three project areas--Lam Pao 18,600 ha and Nam Pong
and Lam Phra Plerng 10,000 ha, each--and also included consultant services to
prepare a second Stage project. Because of initial delays in project imple-
mentation, and a decision to increase coverage and adopt nigher standards for
tertiary development than initially envisaged, the project was not completed
until early 1981, two and one-half years later than originally schedule.
2.j       Feasibility studies for the Northeast Irrigation Project II,
prepared by RID and their consultants (Tahal Consulting Engineers Ltd.) as
part of the Northeast Thailand Irrigation Improvement Project, were completed
in 1976. A Bank preappraisal mission visited the sites in March 1977 and the
project was appraised in September '977. At the request of the Government,
negotiations were deferred until mid-1978 in order to allow works under the
Lam Pao Stage T to be adequately advanced. Negotiations were held during
August 1978. The project comprises two areas about 300 km apart on the Korat
Plateau in Northeast Thailand. The Lam Pao project element in Kalasin
Province is situated 60 km east of Khon Kaen and adjoins the 18,000 ha Stage I



- 3 -
Lam Pao component (Cr. 461-TH). The Lam Takhong elements in Nakhon Ratchasima
Province, are situated along the Lam Takhong River beginning about 20 km
downstream from the dam site and extending eastward for about 55 km. The
provincial capital of Nakhon Ratchasima is adjacent to the project area. The
project was designed to provide facilities for year-round irrigation on about
51,250 hectares where 21,000 farm families largely subsisted on a single crop
of rainfed rice. It would tap the potentiel of the existing Lam Pao and Lam
Takhong reservoirs through the construction or improvement of diversion dams,
canals, drains, and facilities for operation and maintenance. The main
features of the project were to:
(a)  construct main, lateral and tertiary canals, and main drains for
irrigation of 31,550 ha in an area to be supplied by the existing
Lam Pao Reservoir;
(b)  construct 2 diversion dams, main, lateral and tertiary canals, and
main drains to irrigate 6,200 ha in an area served by the existing
Lam Takhong Reservoir (Upper Zone);
(c)  improve existing main, lateral and tertiary canal systems and drains
in an area of 13,500 ha served by the Lam Takhong Reservoir (Lower
Zone);
(d)  construct and equip operati l and maintenance facilities for the
irrigation works included in the project; and
(e)  carry out studies relating to the water supply of Nakhon Ratchasima;
and prepare future irrigation projects.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.1       Following execution of the loan agreements IBRD 1630-TH and IFAD 5-
THA in December 1978 with loans effective from May 1979, project activity
began in April 1979. Physical work began in January 1980 and was completed at
the end of September 1985. Tahal Consulting Engineers Ltd. of Israel in
association with Empire M&T consultants of Thailand were appointed in March
1979 to assist RID with design, engineering detailing and implementation.
Their commission included assistance in establishing an operating and
maintenance (O&M) service on completion and a risk evaluation of the Lam Pao
reservoir.
A. Project Works
3.2       The project comprised 51,250 ha at appraisal in three main subpro-
ject areas--Lam Pao at Kalasin in Kalasin province and Upper and Lower Lam
Takhong at Nakhon Ratchasima in Korat province. At the commencement of the
project, storage reservoirs at Lam Pao (completed in 1968) and Lam Takhong
(1969) were in place as were nine reinforced concrete barrages (1940) in the
Lower Lam Takhong area. The Lam Pao area was partially serviced with main
concrete-lined canals, a 42-km LMC and a 55-km RMC, irrigating some 18,600 ha.



- 4 -
Theme works were constructed between 1975 and 1980 with Bank-Group support
(Credit 461-TH). Irrigation works completed or rehabilitated under the
project co-mand 46,000 ha and, together with the Lam Pao Stage I, provide
irrigation directly for about 64,600 ha of farmland.
3.3       Construction by RID force account began at Lam Pao in January 1980
and were completed at the end of September 1985, together with the bulk of the
authorized extra works. However, some problem areas in main canal embankment
stability persisted cn the old Stage I right main canal which also serves the
Stage II (project) area. This work was completed by RID force account at end-
September 1986. During the work period water deliveries below the design full
supply operating level (FSL) were maintained by irregular release from the
headworks. At Lam Takhong, force account construction in the upper zone began
in January 1980, and in the lower zone, twelve months later. Contract work
began in July 1982. All works at Lam Takhong were completed in late September
1985. Some additional drainage and flood protection work was compl ted early
in 1986. A summary of appraisal estimates and of achievements for the key
items of work is shown in Table 1.
3.4       Problems with land acquisition, particularly for drains, necessi-
tated numerous design changes and minor additions. Additional works
that were found necessary and added to the implementation
schedule included: a new LMC intake, 21 km of flood protection dikes, and
rehabilitation of the Stage I main canals in the Lam Pao area; and improvement
of the nine barrages and the river channel in Lower Lam Takhong. All of these
works are complete except for minor repairs to the Lam Pao main canals, still
underway. Also late in the project farmers requested additional culverts and
road crossings and OFW not included in the planned schedule. Wherever
possible and where clearly justified the requests were met. But, due to
budget constraints, some 358 additional small structures and 445 ha of OFW
will have to be constructed later by the O&M divisions of the RID regional
offices. In general these works, though needed are not essential for opera-
tions of the original project areas. However, minor supplemental works are
needed to enable effective system operations. At Lam Pao these include eight
additional wasteways on the main canals, and at Lower Lam Takhong 6.2 km of
LMC omitted due to budget constraints. At present,t water for this segment
flows through a natural river course.
3.5       The original program for carrying out the works had to be modified
significantly due primarily to design delays and the late production of
reliable survey base maps. This was later partially offset by a change in
policy permitting smaller-scale contracts within the capabilities of local
Thai contractors. However, construction throughout was delayed at the start
by some 12 months and took 69 months to complete (66 months projected at
appraisal). The work was done by RID force account and some 17 LCB contracts,
15 in Lam Pao and 2 in Upper Tam Takhong. Force-account work began slowly,
but as the additional equipment procured for the project became available in
1982 progress improved substantially. Work on the main and secondary laterals
in general proceeded year round but work on the tertiary system was confined
to the dry season to avoid interference with wet-season cropping.



- 5 -
3.6       The 17 LCB contracts totalling B 800 million, 50X of the cost of the
completed works, were mainly for construction of the main and secondary canals
in the Lam Pao subproject. The contracts, generally for 24-month contract
periods, were implemented during FY 1980 to FY 1984. Three LCB contracts for
dike construction at Lam Pao were for shorter, 8-month contract periods while
the contract at Ban Maklua Mai in Upper Lam Takhong was extended to 32
months. In general, considerable time was taken to approve bona fide tenders
and instruct the preferred contractor to proceed. Only one contract was let
within a month of bid opening; eight took more than four months, normally the
limit for bid validity, and the average period was 199 days, with the 95S
percentile for acceptance a prolonged 199 days.
3.7       Design.  In general, project design and detailing was based on
criteria and practice established for Lam Pao Stage I and the RID experience
in construction, operations and management of the earlier completed works
serviced by the Lam Pao and Lam Takhong rebervoirs and barrages. In
consequences some of the weaknesses in the earlier designs were carried
forward into the project, but, also, some were corrected. To facilitate
design approvals and expedite construction RID established an Inspection
Committee to whom all plans for survey, appraisal, and design work were to be
submitted for approval before work could proceed. The committee w-s also
responsible for approving design criteria, drafts of planning, design drawings
and engineering detailing and for final drawing approval.  The committee
I.        apparently contributed little to improving design or simplifying the task of
later operations and management.
3.8       The canal and tertiary system designs were based on a modified
rotational irrigation model providing for tertiary unit rotation at seven day
intervals with the main and lateral canals flowing continuously at fully
supply level (FSL). Experience from Lam Pao Stage I showed that the average
65-8C-ha tertiary-service unit size was inefficient and should be reduced to
30-50 ha. In this way the number of farmers in a water-user group (WUG) would
be reduced to a manageable level and the length of tertiary ditches could be
reduced to 1.5-2 km, thereby enabling better water delivery in the lower
reaches. Full on-farm development and lan4 consolidation was found to be not
economically justified and on-farm works were designed according to the
traditional paddy to paddy irrigation system with each farm turnout serving
about 50 ha or some 20-30 farm units. Main and secondary canals were to be
generally concrete-lined, with some short segments in difficult terrain
widened and protected with gabions and random stone rip rap. However,
wherever practicable improved canals in the lower Lam Takhong subproject were
designed as unlined earth channels. Laterals were mostly unlined exicept in
unstable soils, on high fill segments or at initial curved segmentr where
concrete-lining was used.  No provision was made for regular monit3ring of
water flows or assessing losses, which within the tertiary service units
appear unacceptably high.
3.9       Efficiency.  System efficiencies assumed in the design do not appear
to have been achieved in practice. O&M staff recognize this and have
endeavcr.d to supply water at a level above demand to offset the higher than
expected operational losses. The standard of clearing and tertiary mainte-
nance, including preservation of stop checks, bifurcation chambers and FTO



-6-
varies considerably throughout the project area. Even if properly cleared the
ditch and dike system constructed would be unlikely to achieve 50Z efficiency
on-farm. With maintenance and operations of reasonable standards, the best
efficiency that might be expected is about 30X overall, as against the 582
design and appraisal values. An independent study by the Asian Institute of
Technology in 1978 dry season found 142 overall efficiency for 252 of the
Stage-I Lam Pao subproject. This may prove to be them normal efficiency for
the lower reaches of the Stage II area unless early attention is given to
proper canal and ditch clearing.
3.10      Water Supply and Demand.  Supply for wet-season cropping is no
problem although some care is needed to ensure maximum storage levels are
maintained for the commencement of the following dry season. This is not too
difficult to achieve because of the time lag in t2e late wet seasonal rainfall
reaching the reservoirs. At Lam Pao the 5,430 km catchment area provides an
annual runoff averaging 1,540 MCM but the active storage in the Lam Pao
Reservoir has had to be reduced from 1,260 MCM to a theoretical 900 MCM
because of failure of the mechanism controlling spillway gates and a wet spot
within the earth dam. Lam Pao diversion requirements for dry-season cropping
when applied to the current agricultural mix of 35% paddy and 652 peanuts--
mungbeans (at an average consumptive use of 745 mm) are 362 MCM for 1002 or
217 MCM for a 602 dry-season cropping target. Equivalent daily flows of from
8.0 MCM to 4.8 MCM, respectively, at 302 overall system efficiency (512 to 582
assumed at appraisal), exceed the sum of the main canal capacities: 4.6 MCM
at appraisal but now reduced to 3.6 MCM per diem by operational restraint on
the RMC. In practical terms this has limited the mean service areas to 14,120
ha (382) off the RMC and 9,090 ha (701) off the LMC, in total 48% of the
developed Stage I and II irrigated areas. This is in comparison to the 602
dry-season cropping area assumed at appraisal. Moreover, storage deficiencies
requiring up to a 302 area reduction continue to apply once in seven years.
To increase the area irrigated, it will be necessary to repair the spillway
gate controls, correct the wet spot and adopt new procedures for reservoir
management.
3.11      At Lau- Takhong the 1,340 km2 catchment provides an average annual
runoff of only 250 MCM, and the active reservoir storage capacity is
290 MCM.  Available water is insufficient for year round irrigation.  Dry-
season supply is governed entirely by reservoir storage. Full storage would
permit 3,500 ha of 502 rice and 50Z upland crops to be irrigated or 5,400 ha
of just upland crops. In 1985 and 1986 the January storage was only 240 MCM
which reduced the 50:50 dry-season irrigable area to 2,500 ha or 83Z of the
reduced Upper Lam Takhong developed area (40Z of appraisal).
3.12      Nakhon Ratchasima has first claim on available water for urban use,
currently about 1 MCM per month rising to 2 MCM per month by 1990.  Second
priority has been allocated to wet-season cropping for the whole 16,070 ha
developed. However, due allowance has always to be made for traditional water
use along the 45 km river frontage. Water continues to be taken out of the
river by some 300 water wheels, bamboo weirs ana pumps; sometimes up to 402 of
the low-stage flow discharged from the headworks. A total 25,250 ha,
including the project area, draws water. For both the upper and lower project
zones water demand for 16,070 ha of irrigation during the May-October wet-



season is estimated at 250 MCM. Mean discharge during the first three months
June to August at 0.75 MCM per day is well within the design capacity of the
main canal, the natural river course, even when taking into account
traditional and municipal users; the reservoir inflow remains the limiting
factor.
3.13      Operations and Maintenance.  During the wet season May-September
1985 all 46,000 ha developed by March-April came under irrigation. For most
of the Lam Pao and all the Upper Lam Takhong area this was the first time
water was supplied for iirigation in the newly developed system(s). Water is
reported to have flowed to the end of the canals throughout.  Minor, though
significant, damage ariuing from heavy rainfall and excessive discharge in the
lower small-sectioned main and lateral canals occurred.  Both O&M and
construction teams were deployed to make good the damage.  At the end of the
1986 dry season, water was not readily available at the lower end of the
systems or at the terminal ends of the longer upper-system laterals.
3.14      RID's responsibility for operations and maintenance is confined to
the headworks and barrages, main and secondary canals, check structures, waste
and drainage control structures and the constant head off-takes (CHO), that
service the tertiary (on-farm) system. At present O&M staffing is about 95%
of the 395 needed, but is 80% deficient in properly trained civil-service and
permatient-employee workers: only 19 compared to the 95 required. The
shortage has been partially made up by temporary employees, many of whom do
not meet educational or training standards set for formal government
service. The O&M management are endeavoring to make good the deficiencies by
on-the-job training and standardization of field operations. All tertiary
canals, farm take-offs (FTO), stop checks and tertiary wastes and relief
control structures are the responsibility of farmer water-user groups or, in
their absence, of the individual farmers. This includes water distribution,
clearing and maintenance work.
B. Procurement
3.15      Procurement of construction equipment did not proceed as planned due
to procedural problems in the early stages of international bid preparation
and to slow execution of the procurement contracts. The construction equip-
ment did not become available until FY 1982 some three years after the loan(s)
became effective. Procurement contract(s) for O&M vehicles, concrete work,
workshop and repair, communication and office equipment were not advertised
until June 14, 1985, with contracts signed on September 30, 1985, and final
deliveries in March 1986. The total expenditure on vehicles and equipment
amounted to B 115 million (US$5.0 million), an increase of 20% in baht but
only 7% in US dollar terms over the value, inclusive of physical and price
contingency provisions, projected at appraisal.  The principal reason for the
baht overrun was procurement of 5 additional major items of construction
equipment and 15 trucks, including 3 dump trucks and four 6-ton trucks with
crane. In dollar terms the additional costs were offset by the successive
devaluations of the baht, which totalled 19% over the procurement period 1982
to 1985.



-8-
C. Water Charges
3.16      It was anticipated and included as a Loan covenant that RTG would
impose and collect appropriate charges from beneficiaries of all irrigation
works. The charges would be sufficient to recover RID's operation and
maintenance costs and a reasonable portion of the tertiary systems cost. The
full O&M costs were estimated at B 250 per ha (in 1979 constant prices) for
Law Pao and Upper Lam Takhong and B 150 per ha for Lower Lam Takhong, while
cost recovery of the tertiary system was estimated at B 4,200 per ha oe 50Z of
the total costs. To date, no water charges have been levied on irrigation
schemes operated by RID because the proposed water charges legislation was not
approved by the National Assembly. Due to a dramatic drop in the world market
price of rice, indirect taxes from the rice export premium were also abolished
in 1985. RID has no legal power to enforce water use discipline nor impose
water charges. Its role has been limited to the promotion of water users
groups.
D. Project Costs
3.17      Total project cost was estimated at B 1,628 million (US$80.0 mil-
lion) at appraisal. Valued in local currency, actual cost of B 1,892 million
was about 16% higher on completion. However, taking into account the effects
of the four Baht devaluations over 1981-85, actual cost was in dollar terms
$80.5 million, only a 0.6% overrun. The total cost covers all planned work
items financed by the IBRD and IFAD loans and local budget, as well as
additional work items financed solely from local budget. The significant cost
increases for irrigation, headworl;s, drainage and procurement arose princi-
pally from purchase of more construction equipment; and vehicles than planned
and expansion of the works to include additional controls and structures and
75 km of flood protection levee not provided for at appraisal. Other contri-
buting factor6 were later-than-expected commencement of works, the slow start
on construction and the concentration of the bulk of the work in the latter
years. A comparison of appraisal projections and actual prcject expenditures
is presented in Table 2.
3.18      Physical contingencies--incorporated in the cost sumiary in
Table 2--originally projected at 15% for construction and equipment were
adequate for the project as defined. Price increases, reflected in the Thai
Bureau of Economics monthly price indices for relevant items, are estimated at
31Z. In the appraisal the allowance for price increases was B 334 million or
26Z. The price contingency provision at appraisal would appear to have been
adequate had the work proceeded as programmed.
E. Project Financing
3.19      The Bank and IFAD were expected to finance 44% of the total costs of
the project including 100% of foreign exchange costs and 9% of the local
currency costs. Total loan amount was US$35 million, RTG was expected to
contribute US$45 million to meet the local currency costs. Despite cost
overrun, the actual loan disbursements of US$31 million, (US$4 million was
cancelled), contributed only 38% of total project costs of US$80.5 million.



- 9 -
Due to a Bureau of the Budget restriction, the annual disbursement was fixed
at the beginning of the fiscal year, therefore, it ignored increased costs
incurred during the year. There was no amendment to the Loan Agreem^nt
deopite the increased project costs which were met through provision of
regular budget. A large proportion of the unallocated amount (US$3.1 million)
v2s used mainly to meet the increased costs of equipment and consulting
services. If the increased costs of civil works had been taken into account,
total estigated loan allocation of US$35 million would have been fully
utilized.
IV. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
A. Preproject Agricultural Situation
4.1       Warm temperatures throughout the year and a five-month wet season
(85% of annual rainfall) are the dominant climatic characteristics of the
project areas. Erratic timing of wet-season rainfall often results in 10- to
15-day droughts that significantly reduce crop yields, and no dry-season
cropping, except for cassava, is possible without irrigation. The typical
landform is low flood plains, most developed for wet-season paddy cultivation,
and flat to slightly undulating terrace lands at higher elevations. Although
low-lying clays and clay loams suitable for paddy production are common, sandy
soils also occur throughout the project area. In these soils, low water-
holding capacity and organic matter content limit yields. Saline soils, also
present around Lam Takhong, are not suitable for most upland crops.
Therefore, poor soils have been a factor limiting both the range and level of
cropping carried out in the project areas.
4.2       Prior to the project, paddy was the main crop in the wet season, but
some upland crops were also grown on higher ground free from flooding. In Lam
Pao, there was no irrigation but in Upper Lam Takhong about 1,300 ha of the
total 6,200 ha was irrigated, and in Lower Lam Takhong, the total 13,500 ha
was partially irrigated. In the dry season, irrigation water was available
only for about 1,300 ha of mungbeans and pcanuts in Upper Lam Takhong. The
wet-season paddy consisted mainly of native, photosensitive varieties of low
yield potential but adapted to the prevailing water-level fluctuations.
Farmers in Lam P4o preferred to grow glutinous rice, and in Lam Takhong,
nonglutinous rice. They obtained seed from their own fields which were mostly
prepared by animal traction. Very little fertilizer was used (the varieties
responded poorly, anyway) and pest control measures were minimal. The yields
obtained ranged from 1.5 to 2.0 tons per ha. The dry-season mungbean and
peanut yields, probably overstated in the SAR at 0.8 and 1.8 tons/ha,
respectively, were limited because the fields were irrigated only once, after
the rice straw was burnt and before the upland seeds were dibbled. Fields
were not ploughed, and no fertilizer or other inputs were applied.
B. Expected Project Impact
4.3       The project aimed at providing wet-season irrigation to about
51,250 ha (31,550 ha in Lam Pao, 6,200 ha in Upper Lam Takhong and 13,500 ha
in Lower Lam Takhong) and dry-season irrigation to about 27,800 ha (23,200 ha



- 10 -
in Lam Pao and 4,600 h: in Upper Lam Takhong). Also, access to credit,
extension and other support services would be strengthened, and an adequate
organization of operation and maintenance of the irrigation system would be
met up, both in the main system and at the farm turnout. As a result, the
cropping intensity would increase from 88Z to 1462. In the wet season, rice
would remain the dominant crop, but it was projected that with improved water
supply farmers would shift to higher yielding, semidwarf varieties (HYVs) in
the 60Z of the total project area which would be free from flooding. In the
dry season, about half of the cropped area would be under paddy (all HYV) and
the other half under mungbeans and peanuts. Yields would increase due to
irrigation, the use of higher-yielding varietias, fertilizers and pesticid ,
and adoption of improved cultural techniques. Altogether it was expected that
wet-season rice yields would increase from 1.8 ha in Lam Pao and 2.3 t/ha in
Lam Takhong to over 3.5 t/ha. Dry-season rice yielding about 4.0 t/ha would
be introduced. Peanut and mungbean production would be introduced at Lam Pao
and expanded at Lam Takhong, with average yields increasing 50 to 75
percent. Net farm incomes for medium sized holdings, 2.6 ha in Lam Pao and
1.8 ha in Lam Takhong, were expected to achieve a fourfold increase in Lam Pao
(to about US$715/ha) and about a doubling in Lam Takhong (to US$825/ha).
C. Project Achievements
4.4       Although irrigation water was first made available in 1982 the
agricultural production targets are far from being achieved. Construction was
completed only in 1985 and the irrigation system is not yet fully operational
in many areas. Faced with at best a very erratic supply of irrigation water,
most farmers have been unable to do much dry-season cropping. They have been
unwilling to risk a dry-season rice crop and hesitate to plant upland crops
that, new to the project area, require learning of new cropping techniques.
Another deterrent factor has been the low farm-gate prices, particularly the
dry-season paddy price which in 1986 was less than Baht 2.0/kg, about 60% to
752 of the 1984 and 1985 prices.
4.5       Agricultural Production and Incomes.  In the 1985 wet season,
Stage II irrigation in the Lam Pao area covered 28,400 ha, 962 of tie
appraisal target; virtually the whole area was under paddy. For the whole of
Lam Takhong, the 1985 wet-season area covered about 20,400 ha, or 1072 of the
appraisal target. As for Lam Pao, paddy was by far the main crop grown.
Paddy yields in Lam Pao were acceptable (3.4 tons/ha) but lower for Lam
Takhong (2.9 tons/ha). While no survey data are available on the varieties
grown, the average yields indicate a high percentage of HYVs, particularly in
Lam Pao. The average 3.4 tons/ha paddy yields in Lam Pao since 1983 indicate
that HYVs must occupy at least 502 of the cropped area. A 1983 survey of the
Lam Pao Stage I area, which is adjoining and north of this project area,
showed that HYVs and improved local varieties occupied about 902 of the total
area. Between 1982 and 1983, the area under traditional varieties had
declined sharply. It is probable that the same trend will occur in the
project area and with improved water distribution, the average wet-season
yield for the whole project area could reach 3.8 tons/ha at full
development. It is reasonable to assume that yields at Lam Takhong will catch
up to the levels obtained at Lam Pao.



- 11 -
4.6       For the 1986 dry season, only 420 ha of peanuts was cropped in Lam
Pao although irrigation system cover 29,900 ha. In Upper Lam Takhong, about
4,160 ha (95% of the appraised target) of mungbeans was cropped, a larger area
ot 5,120 ha being cropped in 1985. The very small area cropped in Lam Pao
does not indicate future cropping levels as the canals were closea for
construction during the past two dry seasons and there was little irrigation
water available. Also, until the irrigation system has been fully operated at
design capacity, it is difficult to know how it will perform or how farmers
will use the irrigation water. It is, therefore, too early to say whether the
developed areas in Lam Pao will be fu.Lly cropped, or what will be the cropping
patterns in the future. However, surveys carried out in Lam Pao Stage I found
groundnuts as the main dry-season crop (60% of total area), followed by rice
(35Z) and other crops. It appears that a similar pattern will develop in the
Lam Pao project area at full development. In Lam Takhong, however, dry-season
cropping of mungbean has been a long tradition and it is likely that the
present full coverage with mungbean will continue. Soybeans have been
introduced into the project area but are yet to be adopted on any significant
scale.
4.7       Due to limited irrigation water supply, the current estimates of
full development cropping intensities are 73% and 95% in the without project
(WOP) in Lam Pao and Lam Takhong and 148%, 200% and 100% in the with project
(WP) in Lam Pao, Upper and Lower Lam Takhong, respectively (Table 7).
Projected yields of native paddy and mungbeans are between 20% and 50% lower
than the appraisal yield estimates, while yields of HYV paddy and peanuts are
slightly higher in the with-project situation. Projection of farm income
levels at full development (1991) for typical farms of 2.6 ha at Lam Pao and
1.8 ha at both Upper and Lower Lam Takhong are B 30,400, B 9,150 and B 20,350
respectively. These income levels represent project caused increments of plus
B 24,200 per farm or B 9,300 (US$360) per ha for Lam Pao and B 14,500 per farm
or B 8,050 (US$310) per ha for Upper Lam Takhong. The incremert at Lower Lam
Takhong is only B 3,300 or B 1,840 (US$71) per ha because of the lack of dry-
season cropping. These results are up to 60% below the levels and 100% below
the incremental gains projected at appraisal. The main negative factor
contributing to the lower net and incremental incomes is the lower paddy
prices.
4.8       Farm Management.  Transplanting continues to be the preferred
planting method (95% plus) in both the wet and the dry seasons, the remaining
area being dry broadcasted. The use of pregerminated seeds has just been
Introduced and covers a negligible area. But. as in neighbouring provinces
where this technique has been widely adopted, it is expected to gain in
popularity as irrigation water distribution improves. No data are available
on the amounts of chemical fertilizers, or pesticides, used. However, for Lam
Pao Stage I average fercilizer application rates are less than 75 kg/ha, or
only about 20% to 30% of the dry-season rates recommended. For a more precise
calculation of optimuir and probable fertilizer use rates, rice variety,
nutrient response cur\e, composition of the fertilizer and relative prices of
paddy and nutrients have to be taken into account. That level of precision
has yet to be reached. But, clearly there are no technical constraints for
achieving yields even higher than the assumed 4.3 tons/ha at full develop-
ment. However, it is necessary to provide sufficient staff, equipment and



- 12 -
funds for operation and maintenance of the irrigation network, and for
establishing water user groups that function effectively at the on-farm
levels. These conditions are even more critical for irrigated upland crop
production. At present, due to a very erratic and inadequate irrigation
schedule and poor cultural techniques, yields of irrigated peanuts and
mungbean average only 1.2 tons/ha and 0.7 tons/ha, respectively. Irrigations
rarely exceed two to three over the whole cropping period, causing water
stress and a drop in yield. The limited irrigation is due to a lack of water
control and farmers being reluctant to irrigate if they cannot drain excess
water in time. This problem is, of course, partly caused by inadequate land
preparation for upland crop irrigation and drainage. The land surface has to
be graded to avoid low spots where water cannot be drained off.
V. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
5.1       Direct benefits of the project are largely the incremental produc-
tion of paddy, peanuts and muingbeans. To provide benefits the cropping
intensities, estimated, increase from 85% preproject to 148% at full
development in Lam Pao and from 97% to 126% in Lam akhong. Total cropped
areas increase from 28,400 and 17,400 ha to 44,300 and 20,400 ha at full
development in Lam Pao and Lam Takhong, respectively. Incremental yields are
averaged at 2.0 t/ha for wet season paddy, 4.3 t/ha for dry season paddy,
1.5 t/ha for peanuts and 0.3 t/ha for mungbeans. The incremental annual
production is estimated to reach 105,000 tons of paddy, 12,000 tons of peanuts
and 8,500 tons of mungbears at full development.
5.2       The ERRs have been estimated separately for Lam Pao and Lam Takhong
subprojects and the entire project. Analysis is carried out in 1986 constant
prices, with past expenditures restated in 1986 price terms by using the
wholesale price index. Costs of the additional rehabilitation works and O&M
after FY 1986 estimated by RID are included in the analysis. Costs of future
project preparation were excluded. Because the major incremental production
in the project is paddy, price interpolations between 1986, 1990 and 1995
border prices in 1986 constant values for paddy, have been used. Estimated
prices for nonglutinous paddy are B 2,435/t in 1986, then increase to
B 3,285/t io 1990 and drop to B 2,910/t in 1995, or about 25-40% lower than
the projected paddy price of B 4,320/t estimated at appraisal. The price of
glutinous paddy is about 92% of the price of nonglutinous paddy. For
simplicity in economic calculations and because quantities are small, the
projected 1990 border prices for fertilizers, mungbeans and peanuts are used
throughout the analysis. A standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.92 is used
for converting the financial prices of nontraded items. The averaged current
market wage rate of B 30 per man-day for unskilled agricultural labnur
adjusted by the SCF is assumed to reflect the opportunity cost of labour.
5.3       In estimating the project benefits a 30-year period of analysis, the
8-year construction period, and full benefits in year 12 (FY 1990) were
assumed for both subprojects. The re-estimated ERRs are 11% for Lam Pao, 12%
for Lam Takhong and 11% for the entire project. These compare with appraisal
estmates of 26%, 20% and 25%, respectively. Major factors contributing to



- 13 -
lower ERRs are cost overrun, mainly in the Lam Pao, lower cropping intensi-
ties, delays in benefits and lower prices of paddy. It is estimated that
20,000 farm families would benefit directly from production impact and
indirectly from employment--12,000 families in Lam Pao and 8,000 families in
Lam Takhong. Approximately 7.5 million man-days of employment would be
generated annually at full development. This is about one million fewer than
projected at appraisal but is an annual increase of 3.5 million man-days over
without-project employment.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFURMANCE
A. Royal Irrigation Department
6.1       At the beginning of project implementation RID appointed a project
management team including a project director (DDG) project manager, a project
engineer for each of the three subprojects, and design staff from the central
RID design office. Force account (RID own) construction on main canals and
all drainage work was the responsibility of the Large Projects Construction
Division while the Operation and Maintenance Division On-farm Development
Branch (subunit) undertook the tertiary system construction at Lam Pao and the
supervision of contract work at Lam Pao and Lam Takheng including the diver-
sion dams.
6.2       Reporting to the Project Director and top management coordination
were generally adequate. In the field, project management played a surveil-
lance role and does not appear to have exercised control over the programming
or standards of construction of the various force account activities.
Overlapping of responsibilities persisted to completion. With, consultant
assistance, project management was able to achieve completion in reasonable
time and to satisfactory standards. The project apparently did not result in
development of an experienced project management group which might be deployed
on to other works, accept responsibility for coordination, and progress, or
form the nucleus of an efficient O&M team. Although fiel.d survey and mapping
techniques improved, the same degree of skill and understanding was not
achieved in engineering detailing, which continued to be a limiting factor in
project implementation. Close liaison between the farmers and field
management staff in the early stages might have achieved better understanding,
earlier consents, and reduced the quantities of laterals and tertiary works
deleted.
6.3       Operation and maintenance of completed works, including advisory
services to the farmer in the care and clearing of tertiary works, has been
slow in getting established despite earlier experience going back to the 1969
completion of the reservoirs and 1974 completion of Lam Pao Stage I. C'ose
daily surveillance by senior technical staff and the prompt correction of
inadequacies and damage which would enhance farmer confidence and improve
system efficiencies with reduced wasteage has still to be practiced. No
system uf preventive maintenance or barrage adjustment to preserve water not
required in the separate command areas has been clearly establisnled although
routine procedures for seven-day rotaLional distribution from the primary and
secondary canals have been introduced. Inadequate O&M budget, shortage of



- 14 -
trained or skilled manpower and preoccupation with rehabilitation of Lam Pao
RMC is reflected in the inconsistency of water supply to the lower and more
remote farms.
B. Consultants
6.4       The project conjultants appointed at the beginning of the project
provided valuable assistance to RID both in overall management and implementa-
tion and the detailing of works. The survey assistance was particularly
valuable. Working relations were good throughout. The consultant appears to
have made an earnest endeavour to achieve successful and early completion.  It
is to RID's disadvantage that more notice was not given to some of the minor
issues of standards of construction and the more important provision of waste-
ways. The initial perceived savings are now more than offset by the high cost
of remedial works, rehabilitation aid repair.  With regard to O&M procedures
insufficient attention has been given to the continuation training and day-to-
day management. The termination of the consultant services in December 1985
without having an efficient O&M organisation functioning properly wes prema-
ture and to the disadvantage of RID and the project. Physical work was super-
vised and monitored by RID p oject staff with some assistance from the con-
sultant, particularly on formal contracts. Overall supervision of the force
account work was not properly exercised by the p.oject management, but
defaulted to in-house construction unit management. Exceptions were the major
structures including the two diversion dams which were idequately supervised
with the help of the consultant.
C. Agricultural Support Services
6.5       Research and Extersion.  While no specific reseer-h action was
proposed under the project, in or near the project areas several crop research
centers are being strengthened under the separate National Agricultural
Research Project (Ln. 1922-TH). In Khon Kaen, a field crops research center
is being developed and field-crop and rice experiment stations are present
within the project areas in Kalasin and Nakhon Ratchasima provinces. The main
focus of work is the development and multiplication of improved varieties and
cultural techniques, including fertilizer rates and pest control methods.
There is no crop variety or husbandry constraint to attaining the project
yield Zevels aimed at. Higher-yielding varieties of rice, peanuts and
mungbean are available to farmers, and the cultural techniques to achieve high
yields are known, although not yet fully adopted by farmers. Pregerminated
planting is still new to the project area, although very popular in
neighboring provinces. However, although Department of Agriculture (DOA)
research programs on rainfed crops to replace cassava have been under way in
the Northeast for some time, there is no program for irrigated upland crops
such as peanuts and mungbeans. Research on irrigation techniques, outside the
responsibility of DOA, should have an integrated, multidisciplinary approach
involving RID for water management, Land Development Department (LDD) for soil
management and DOA for irrigated crop husbandry techniques. Institutional
responsibilities should be clarified and mechnnisms set up for these agencies
to participate in joint research programs on irrigated crop production.



- 15 -
6.6       At appraisal each village-level extension agent had to cover up to
4,500 families, but this number has been lowered to about 1,000 families under
separate projects to strengthen the Department of Agricultural Extension
countrywide (Loa'i 1393-TH and 1752-TH). A system of continuous training of
agents by subject matter specialists (SMS) and mandatory fortnightly visits to
farmers have been established.  The SMSs in turn attend monthly DOA workshops
on technical themes that provide a nccessary linkage between research and
extension. Informal linkages are frequent, but official department coordina-
tion comeittees at provincial level have never functioned effectively. The
extension services have been successful in getting farmers to use HYVs and
improved cultural methods; however, their efforts to promote irrigated upland
cropping have yielded little result. A major constraint could be the lack of
appropriately trained permanent SMSs. At present, only two SMSs at provincial
levels specialize in c.ther rice, upland crop or horticultural crop produc-
tion, and they have limited training in soil- and water-management tech-
niques. As a reoult, extension agents receive little training in the key
topics for farmers in the project area. Short annual courses on water
management organized by RID are also not sufficient.
6.7       Water User Groups.  Operation and maintenance of the irrigation
system within the tertiary command areas was expected to be the responsibility
of the farmers themselves organized into water user groups, each serving an
average 30-50 ha and 25-30 farms. Each group would elect a committ3e and a
chairman responsible for ensuring smooth operation and maintenance of the
system. The O&M unit of RID, with consultant assistance, would promote the
water user groups and provide them with technical assistance. RID's O&M units
have so far organized farmers into 367 WUGs in Lam Pao, 100 WJGs in Upper Lam
Takhong and none in Lower Lam Takhong. Although the irrigation system is now
complete, it cannot function at full capacity until the establishment of the
remaining needed 750 WUCs. So far, the WUCs have been working quite well but
this depends very much on the collective spirit and willingness to sacrifice
personal time. The quality of work, however, is iot entirely sacisfactory as
maintenance, mainly with voluntary labor, is being carried out only once a
year, leaving many canals and ditches choked with weeds. Also, performance of
the WUGs would need to be improved whenever irrigated upland crops assume more
importAnce. Then, not only water distribution is at issue but also the type
of cropping pattern and synchronization of cultural operations. Farmers who
do not contribute their own labor for O&M presently must pay a cash O&M fee
unofficially fixed by each WUG at B 40-50 per farmer per year, regardless of
the area cropped by the farmer. This sum is not sufficient to cover works
required to ensure minimum maintenance standards. A more appropriate level
would be B 400 (equivalent to 8 man-days) per ha per farmer which is the
present rate fixed by water-user cooperatives in the Phitsanulok Irrigation
P;:oject.
6.8       Agricultural Credit.  Access to institutional credit is not a
constraint in the project area. The Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural
Cooperatives (BAAC) is fully equipped through its branches to provide
seasonal, medium-term and long-term credit to all farmers in the project
area. Credit is given to individuals, BAAC's farmer credit associations and
cooperatives. Seasonal credit is provided in cash or in kind at an annual
interest rate of 13%. However, at present not more than one third of farmers



- 16 -
use credit directly or through cooperatives. Some of the remaining farmers
use credit associations, but some of these have been disqualified due to low
repayment rates. Thus, there was no lending to associations in Kalasin
province, and only one small farmer group obtained credit in Nakton Ratchasima
province. On the other hand, loan recoveries from BAAC's clients and coopera-
tives are satisfactory, ranging from 80% to 100Z, except for the cooperatives
in Kalasin where the recover in 1985 amounted to only 45%. The volume of
credit for BAAC's direct clients average B 12,000 per year per borrower, or
about twice as much as for each member of cooperatives.
D. The Bank
6.9       Bank performance during project development, appraisal and implemen-
tation was generally good. However, in the latter stages of implementation,
supervision efforts were reduced, resulting in failure to adequately encourage
and assist in the transition from construction to operations phases. As is
typical in such projects, most of the Bank's attention was on monitoring works
completed, expenditures and loan disbursements. Government's explanations of
operations and maintenance failures resulting from serious budget constraints
and inherent bureaucratic-administrative problems were readily accepted and
allowed to stop possible Bank attempts to push for RID or other agency
performance in providing a,equate O&M budgets and staff--required by the Loan
covenants. In essence, because of the construction focus by all project
implementation workers and monitors, as 4s virtually always the case for large
irrigation projects, appropriate operation aiud maintenance resources, and
organization will be made available only at considerable delay and additional
cost after works are completed. Bank supervision organization and performance
should have been managed to forestall these common problems. They were not.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.1       This project aimed at increasing cropping intensity and yields on
about 51,250 ha through the improvement and extension of irrigation works. It
provided for construction of irrigation and drainage systems for 31,550 ha as
a second phase of the Lam Pao Project (the first phAse had developed an area
of 18,600 ha), construction of two diversion dams as well as irrigation and
drainage systems for E,200 ha in upper Lam Takhong, and the improvement of
existing systems covering 13,500 ha in lower Lam Takhong. Over a 7-year
period, total costs were estimated at B 1,628 million (US$80 million). The
project was jointly financed with IFAD.
7.2       The project commenced promptly and, with an extension of six months,
it was closed in March 1986. The main elements of the project construction
and rehabilitation works have been completed, the exceptions are small works
in Lam Pao which are estimated to need about B 29 million for completion in
FY 1987. A total of 46,000 ha of tertiary systems has been developed, of
which 29,934 ha in Lam Pao and the remaining 16,066 ha in Lam Takhong (Table
1). The system field delivery efficiency (58%) assumed during design has not
been achieved. As was the case in Lam Pao phase I, operational tertiary-
service units were too large and ditches too long and of insufficient capacity
for efficient delivery, especially in the lower reaches. With reasonable O&M



- 17 -
the best efficiencies which might be achieved would be 30Z or perhaps 352.
Since the system has just been completed, additional operational experience
and studies are needed on reservoir management and to monitor and hopefully
improve deliveries. Only 402 of the water-user groups responsible for terti-
ary operation and maintenance have been organized. About 95Z of the required
OEM staff is in place but is 802 deficient in skilled permanent employees.
7.3       Construction was completed only in 1985, and the irrigation system
is not yet fully operational; however, about 48,800 ha (including some rainfed
lands) were planted in the 1985 wet season, and virtually all was paddy.
Yields were reported at 2.9-3.4 tons per ha and should reach 3.8 tons at full
development. Faced with uncertain water supplies and low paddy prices, and
lacking experience with upland crops, farmers made limited plantings to
peanut, mungbeans and paddy during the 1986 dry season. Eventually, dry-
season cropping is expected to increase to 18,300 ha. Additional efforts are
required to introduce improved cropping practices, organize water user grouws
and assure adequate and equitable water distribution.
7.4       Total costs of the project have been B 1,892 million, which
represents a cost overrun of 16%. The main reason was the considerable
increase in the volume of civil works, particularly of canal rehabilitation
and the flood-protection embankment in Lam Pao.
7.5       RID institucional deficiencies in the project included delays in the
contracting procedure, lags in procurement of equipment needed for force
account work, and assignment of inadequate staff and budget for operations and
maintenance. The Inspection Committee contributed little in overcoming
engineering constraints carried over from Phase I experience. Failure to
provide RID a legal basis for collection of water charges or to enforce water-
use discipline have left these matters to water-user groups, which in many
cases are yet to be organized. The Bank, while attentive to monitoring
implementation, failed to obtain RID correction of organization, design and
operational and maintenance deficiencies due in part to less than normal field
supervision and failure to follow up with detailed reports to Bank and project
management.
7.6       The re-estimated ERRs are 11  for Lam Pao, 12% for Lam Takhong and
Ill for the entire project. This compares with 25%, 20Z and 252 at
appraisal.  Majo: factors which have contributed to lowering the ERRs have
been cost overrun, mainly in Lam Pao, substantial reduction in dry season
irrigation and lower paddy prices.

Upon completion of the Second Northeast Thailand
Irrigation Project, works were transferred to the Lam Pao,
Upper and Lower Lam Takong O&M Projects for further
administration.
4.   OAG's Comments and Recommendations
4.1 General Cgmments of Office of the Auditor General
The Second Northeast Thailand Irrigation Project
was a project for the construction and improvement of
irrigation system, aiming at increasing rate of produc-
tivity, income and employment opportunity of the people in
the Northeast. It was targeted that 21,000 farm families in
an area of 197,200 rai (31,552 ha.) in Kalasin and 123,125
ral (19,700 ha.) in Nakhon Ratchasima would benefit from
this project through the expansion of irrigated area and
Improvement of some works completed during Phase 1. OAG



-37-                    Annex I
Page 4
found this project vory suitable for the arid Northeast
where agricultural water problem prevailed. At present, the
project has been completed as scheduled and water 1s being
irrigated evenly throughout the project area. It can be
said that the project has reached its objective at a level.
The ex'ent of Its future accomplishment depends on other
conditions such as support of soeds, fertilizer and pos-
ticide, credits for farmers, and more importantly, farmers'
understanding in how to optimize irrigation water.  OAG
recommended that RID cooperate with other agencies in
agricultural extension programmes, educating farmers nn how
to use lrrigation water optimally. Such practice will even-
tually help increase the farmers' income.
It was discoversd during the construction of the
Lam Pao Project in Kalasin that soil in the project area was
of low quality easily causing.damages to concrete lined
canals. Realizing the possible high cost of repair, the
project had then switched to reinforced concrete canals
which were more costly. OAG recommended that RID take into
consideration the reinforced concrete canals with relatively
high cost but with longer useful life and the low cost con-
crete lined ones with a shorter useful life and high
maintenance cost. Svch compar,ison will provide more infor-
mation for the future planning of similar type projects as
to which would yield higher rate of return but lower in
costs of construction and maintenance.
4.2 Project Constraints
4.2.1 The three O&M Projects need more staff in
operation and maintenance of structures, canals and drains.
At the time of auditing, the Upper Lam Takong Project has no
O&M officers. Some officials from Lower Lam Takong Project
had to eupervise works temporarily.
4.2.2 The project does not have adequate O&M
equipment, especially the Lam Takong Project which has not
yet received any such equipment as specified in the Loan

disbursed totally US Dollars s0,578,847.57 of loan proceeds;
of which US Dollars 15,304,290.38 were from IBRD loan and US
Dollars 16,274,557.19 from IFAD loan.
7.   LoAn Intersts and Commitment Charce
According to the Comptroller General's Department
accounts, in FY 1988 the Government had paid for the project
Baht 60,698,380.70 as loan interests and Baht 552,7'2.92 as
loan commitment charge.
8.   Indirect Exoenditures
