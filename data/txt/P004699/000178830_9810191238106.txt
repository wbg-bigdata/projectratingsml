THAILAND
APPRAISAL OF THE NORTHEAST IRRIGATION PROJECT II
1. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Introduction
1.01      The Government of the Kingdom of Thailand has requested the Bank
and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) to assist in
financing the Northeast Irrigation Project II. The project would improve and
extend irrigation facilities covering about 51,000 ha in the service area of
two existing reservoirs.  This would be the  tenth  Bank Group operation for
promoting irrigated agriculture in Thailand and the second such irrigation
project in the Northeast Region.
1.02      The project was prepared by the Government, with the assistance of
consultants (TAHAL, Israel). The feasibility study was completed in 1976,
and was financed under the Northeast Thailand Irrigation Improvement Project
(Cr. 461-TH).
1.03      This report is based on the findings of a preappraisal mission,
comprising of Messrs. W. T. Smith, J. G. Stemp (Bank), R. B. Campbell, and
C. Gonzales (Consultants), which visited Thailand in February/March 1977 and
an appraisal mission in September 1977, comprising Messrs. W. T. Smith,
J. G. Stemp, Ms. N. K. Hill (Bank) and C. Gonzales (Consultant).
The Agricultural Sector
1.04      The agricultural sector in Thailand accounts for about 30% of GNP,
employs 78% of the labor force, and contributes about 60% of total export
earnings. Agricultural production has grown at an annual rate of around 4%
for the past six years, compared with a 6% increase for the economy as a
whole. Sustained growth in the agricultural sector has kept pace with
domestic demand for food and raw materials and has doubled the value of
exports over the past six years.
1.05      Thailand's performance in agriculture is in a large measure due to
the Government's policy of allowing vigorous growth in the private sector and
supporting this growth through investments in infrastructure (roads, water
control, ports, electric power, etc.). Not only has production increased,
but it also has become diversified. Thus, though area planted to rice has
increased by about 2% annually, the share of rice in total area planted has
dropped from 71% in 1965 to 64% in 1975, while its export share declined in
relative terms from over 25% of total agricultural exports to about 20%.
Maize and cassava exports together now exceed the value of rice exports.
1.06      As the supply of uncultivated land declines, further growth will
depend on attention to the issues briefly discussed below:
(a)  Productivity:  New land now being brought under cultivation
is of an increasingly marginal nature, thus the main source of
increased production must come from higher cropping intensities



- 2 -
and yields. This will require further investment in irrigation
and infrastructural facilities as well as more effective
agricultural research and extension.
(b)  Land Occupation:  More efforts are needed to develop farming
techniques to sustain yields on marginal land now being exploited,
to provide greater security of ownership, and to avoid land tenancy
problems. Government efforts in this area need to be more
effectively planned and executed.
(c) Government Institutions: Further growth in agriculture will
place heavier demands on Government institutions than in the past.
The roles of the various agencies involved in land development,
land settlement and land reform need to be more clearly defined to
avoid overlapping responsibilities and duplication of effort.
Also, agencies whose tasks are now clearly defined will have to
reach higher standards of performance than in the past.
(d) Agricultural Credit: In general, the Thai farmer has difficulty
in obtaining institutional credit. Recently, the Government has
taken steps to remedy this situation which, unless corrected, could
constrain future growth.
1.07      Government intends to accelerate implementation and planning of
agricultural development projects in general and irrigation projects in
particular. Development of the irrigation subsector plays a major role in
the Government's efforts. Irrigation typically leads to large increases in
productivity and farm incomes and can also serve income distribution goals,
provided investment is directed at lower income groups and regions. Intensi-
fication of production on existing cultivated land would also ease encroachment
into forest areas.
Irrigated Agriculture
1.08      Most of the irrigable areas in Thailand are in the flood plains of
the major rivers where a combination of heavy rainfall and flooding precludes
the cultivation of crops other than paddy in the wet season. In the Chao
Phya Plain, heavy soils predominate and paddy is the preferred crop in the
dry season as well. The situation is similar in the coastal plains of the
south. Dry-season cropping is more diversified on the alluvial soils of
the north, and in the small areas so far developed for irrigation in the
northeast. In the wet season, the harvested area of rice averages about
7.7 million ha of which the irrigated areas account for some 1.8 million ha.
Close to 0.4 million ha of rice is irrigated in the dry season. Since
virtually all land suitable for rice is now cultivated in the wet season,
any major gains in rice production will have to come from higher yields in
both rainfed and irrigated areas, and increases in the area cropped in the
dry season. To meet domestic demand and maintain Thailand's share of the
world's export market, production would have to increase from 15.1 million



-3-
tons of paddy in 1976 to 22.7 million tons in 1990.  Over the same period,
assuming a yield increase of- 20% in rainfed areas, irrigated paddy production
would have to more than double from 5.5 million to 12 million tons.
1.09      Since its formation in 1904, the Royal Irrigation Department (RID)
has constructed irrigation, flood control and navigation systems which
benefit nearly two million hectares. Early irrigation development was charac-
terized by an extensive approach aimed at modifying natural flood regimes
over large tracts of land. This method, which was appropriate to the vast
flat lands of the Chao Phya plain, was applied in other regions with less
success, particularly in the Northeast where the irregular terrain precludes
flood irrigation except in the narrow river valleys.
1.10      Furthermore, the circumstances that favored this extensive approach
have now changed. Farming techniques have advanced, and current and projected
future prices give the incentives for farmers to take advantage of higher
standards of on-farm development. Thus, future exploitation of Thailand's
irrigation potential will require more emphasis on reliable and timely
delivery of water to the farmers' fields. This will involve upgrading of
virtually all of the existing irrigation systems, and incorporating higher
standards of water control in the expansion of existing systems and in new
projects.
1.11      Since 1950, the Bank has assisted in financing nine irrigation
projects and three multipurpose projects. Loans and credits in the period
1950-1977 amount to US$468 million. In the Chao Phya Basin, Bank-financed
projects include the Chai Nat Diversion Dam and related canal systems
(Ln. 36-TH), Bhumiphol Dam on the Ping River (Ln. 175-TH), construction of
tertiary canals and drains known as the "Ditches and Dikes Project"
(Ln. 328-TH) and the Sirikit Dam on the Nan River (Ln. 514-TH). More
recent projects which embody higher standards of on-farm development include
the Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement Projects I and II (Cr. 379-TH and
Ln. 1468-TH), and the Phitsanulok Project (Ln. 1149-TH), a major new develop-
ment on the Nan River.
1.12      In the Mae Klong Basin, Bank-financed projects include the Vajira-
longkorn Diversion Dam on the Mae Klong and the first stage of a major canal
system (Ln. 394-TH), the Petchaburi Project (Ln. 327-TH) and the Ban Chao Nen
multipurpose project on the Kwae Yai (Ln. 977-TH). In Southern Thailand,
under the Pattani Project (Ln. 1485-TH), the Bank is helping to finance a dam
and power plant which will provide the potential for irrigation development
on about 60,000 ha in the Pattani River Basin. In the Northeast Region
financing has been provided for the Northeast Irrigation Improvement Project
(Cr. 461-TH) which included a provision for the preparation of a second stage
development.
Project Formulation
1.13      Storage dams are essential to irrigation in the Northeast.  During
the dry season, the flow in all except the lower reaches of the larger rivers
virtually ceases. In the wet season, river flows follow a similar pattern to
rainfall with sharp recessions in flow, coinciding with drought periods.



-4-
Runoff per sq km is much lower than in the Northern and Southern regions, and
the potential for year-round irrigation is limited to about 300,000 ha or
some 10% of the total paddy area. At present, about 30,000 ha benefit from
wet-season irigation and about 8,000 ha are irrigated in the dry season. In
the 1960s, the Royal Irrigation Department began a major program of dam and
canal construction in the Northeast. At the present time there are six large
projects designed to irrigate about 160,000 ha. The area receiving reliable
and timely irrigation is far less than the potential of the existing projects
because of technical deficiencies in the canal systems.
1.14      In support of the Government's efforts to make more effective use
of existing irrigation facilities in the Northeast, the Northeast Irrigation
Improvement Project was initiated in 1974 with Bank assistance (Cr. 461-TH).
This project aims at upgrading and completing irrigation works serving 37,300
ha in three project areas: Lam Pao (17,000 ha), Nam Pong (10,200 ha) and Lam
Phra Plerng (10,100 ha). Delays in the selection of consultants and subsequent
contract negotiations, followed by delays in equipment procurement, caused
the project to get off to a slow start. Nevertheless, despite numerous
problems, mostly administrative, substantial improvements have been made.
The project originally included rehabilitation of all main and lateral
canals, and construction and/or improvement of tertiary canals on some 22,500
ha of relatively flat land (about 50% of the original service area). Rehabil-
itation of canals has involved more work than was originally anticipated, but
is now about 60% complete. Also, RID has decided to construct new tertiaries
on about 34,500 ha of which 17,500 ha have been completed to date. Even
though these factors, together with sharp inflation since 1973 (wage rates
and equipment costs have almost doubled), have led to costs being about
double the appraisal estimate, the ERR will be over 20% because of the
rise in the projected price of rice and other crops and the larger area to be
developed for double cropping. Because of the initial delays and larger
scope of the project, it is now scheduled to be completed in 1980, two
years behind schedule. The response of the farmers to the improvement of
irrigation systems has been encouraging with dry season cropping intensities
in individual tertiary blocks reaching 60 to 70% within two years of the
completion of facilities.
1.15      The project also provided for the preparation of a second stage
development. Under this provision a feasibility study for the Northeast
Irrigation Project II was completed in 1976. The proposed project would
(a) complete the expansion of the Lam Pao project area by constructing the
canal systems to cover 31,600 ha; and (b) develop 19,700 ha served by the
existing Lam Takhong Dam.
1.16      Other projects aimed at irrigation improvement in the Northeast are
an ADB-financed project to develop 13,000 ha of the Nam Pong project, and a
USAID-financed project for improving existing systems at Lam Nam Oon. A
project for expanding the Nam Pong system by 15,700 ha is to be financed by
KfW.

2. THE PROJECT AREAS
Location
2.01      The project is located in the Northeast region of Thailand
and comprises two areas on the Korat Plateau about 300 km apart (Map 10305R):
(a) The Lam Pao project, Kalasin Province, situated 60 km east
of Khon Kaen and adjoining a 17,000 ha component of the ongoing
Northeast Irrigation Improvement Project (Cr. 461-TH).
(b) The Lam Takhong project in Nakhon Ratchasima (Korat) Province,
situated along the Lam Takhong River beginning about 20 km down-
stream from the dam site and extending eastward for about 55 km.
The provincial capital of Nakhon Ratchasima, with a population of
85,000, is adjacent to the project area.
Both areas of the project are close to National Highway No. 2 and the main
railroad linking the Northeast region to Bangkok. There is an adequate
network of provincial and district roads within the project areas.
Climate
2.02      The tropical and monsoonal climate with its warm temperatures
throughout the year, provides a potential 12-month growing season. About
85% of the average annual rainfall (1,400 mm at Lam Pao and 1,100 mm at Lam
Takhong) occurs in the wet-season between May and October. Although total
seasonal amounts are adequate for a wet-season rice crop, poor rainfall
distribution causes drought periods of 10 to 15 days (usually in July and
August or during October) and reduces yields significantly. In the dry
season (November to February) crop production, except for cassava, is only
possible with irrigation. Further climatic details are given in Table 2.1.
Topography, Land Use and Soils
2.03      The two service areas of the project are located in the valleys
of the Lam Pao and Lam Takhong rivers downstream of the dam sites. The
principal land forms consist of low-lying flood plains with a characteristic
levee-basin landscape, and flat to slightly undulating low and middle terrace
lands at higher elevations. Longitudinal slopes are gradual, 1% or less,
while transverse slopes range between 1% and 5%.
2.04      Most of the cultivable land within the project areas has been
developed for wet-season paddy. Dry-season cultivation under irrigation is
limited to the upstream part of the Lam Takhong project, where mung beans
and peanuts are cultivated in narrow areas along the natural levees of the
Lam Takhong and its tributaries. Cassava is grown under rainfed conditions
on the higher terraces which are generally at too high an elevation to be
irrigable.

2.05      Soils in the project areas are of mixed alluvium overlying
sedimentary sandstone and siltstones. Heavy textured clays and clay loams
with poor drainage predominate in the low-lying flood plains and low terraces,
while lighter textured, moderately well-drained loams and sandy loams are
found on the higher terraces and river levees. These lighter soils account
for about 15% of the irrigable area. Apart from the recent alluvium of the
flood plains, the soils are of low natural fertility. A semi-detailed
soil survey indicates about 6% of the project area at Lam Pao and 20%
of Lam Takhong Lower Zone have soils with low to moderate salinity. Rice is,
at present, grown on these soils in the wet season with yields only slightly
lower than other nonsaline soils. This is due to the effect of heavy rains
and the accumulation of surface runoff which tends to dilute the salinity in
the root zone during the wet season. A similar effect would be produced by
irrigation. Under the project, the saline soils would be cropped only to
paddy. The soils in both projects are suited to rice and about 50% of Lam
Pao and 30% of Lam Takhong are also suitable for irrigation of upland crops.
Farm Size and Land Tenure
2.06      There are about 13,000 farm families in the Lam Pao project area,
averaging 7 people per family, and 8,000 in the Lam Takhong project area,
averaging 6 per family.  Farm size distribution for Lam Pao, based on data
from selected villages, is shown in Table 2.2. The average holding is 2.8 ha
of which 2.3 ha are paddy land located within the project area plus 0.5 ha of
upland, (mainly cassava and kenaf) located outside the project area. The
smaller farms tend to have their total holdings concentrated in lowland
paddy, while larger farms have a greater proportion of upland. No data on
farm size distribution are available for Lam Takhong but estimates are that
the average size of holding in the project area is about 1.8 ha with little
or no additional upland area. Virtually all of the farms in both project
areas are owner-cultivated.

Existing Irrigation Facilities
2.07         Lam Pao.  The irrigation water supply for the Lam Pao project
area will be provided from the existing Lam Pao reservoir through an exten-
sion of the canal system of the ongoing Stage I project (Cr. 461-TH). The
Lam Pao dam, completed in 1968, consists of a 30 m high earth dam, about 6 km
of low earthfill dikes, and a concrete spillway. Irrigation canals to serve
a Stage I area of about 18,000 ha on both banks of the river downstream of
the dam were built in the period 1968-73. Completion and improvement of this
system was initiated in 1974 as part of the Northeast Irrigation Improvement
Project (para. 1.14).
2.08         Lam Takhong.  The water supply for the Lam Takhong project
area is provided by a reservoir formed by the Lam Takhong dam. The dam,
completed in 1969, is a 40 m high earthfill structure with a crest length of
520 m provided with a service spillway and an emergency spillway. The
service area is divided into an Upper and Lower Zone (para. 3.07). There are
no engineered irrigation works in the Upper Zone of the service area although
individual farmers irrigate small areas close to the river by means of bamboo
diversion dams, water wheels and pumps. In the 13,500 ha Lower Zone, an
irrigation system was built in the 1940s comprising nine diversion structures
and 115 km of main and secondary canals. This area experiences water short-
ages due to uncontrolled upstream diversions. These difficulties are com-
pounded by inadequacies in the design of the system and deterioration of the
existing works from lack of maintenance.
3. THE PROJECT
Project Description
3.01      The main features of the project are:
(a) construction of main, lateral and tertiary canals, and main
drains for irrigation of 31,550 ha in an area to be supplied by
the existing Lam Pao Reservoir;
(b) construction of two diversion dams, main, lateral and tertiary
canals, and main drains to irrigate 6,200 ha in an area served by
the existing Lam Takhong Reservoir (Upper Zone);
(c) improvement of existing main, lateral and tertiary canal systems
and drains in an area of 13,500 ha served by the Lam Takhong
Reservoir (Lower Zone);
(d) construction of, and equipment for operation and maintenance
facilities for the irrigation works included in the project; and
(e) consulting services to assist in the design, implementation and
monitoring of the project; to carry out studies relating to the
water supply for Korat; and to prepare future irrigation projects.



-9-
Project Works
3.02      Lam Pao. The 48,550 ha service area of the Lam Pao project is being
developed in two stages. Completion and improvement of irrigation systems in
the Stage I area of 17,000 ha is being carried out under a project financed
in part by Credit 461-TH. The proposed project includes the construction of
all the works needed to develop the remaining 31,550 ha in the Stage II area.
3.03      The project would provide for the construction of 57 km of main
canals and 196 km of laterals. The Lam Pao project was planned and designed
in the late 1960s at a time when RID had adopted a policy of providing
concrete lining in all main and lateral canals. Thus, all main and lateral
canals in the Stage I area are concrete lined and the main canals of the
Stage II area have been designed as concrete lined canals and parts of them
have been constructed. About 14 km of main canal remains to be built on the
left bank and 43 km on the right bank, and designs have been completed and
right-of-way acquired. Therefore, to avoid delays in revising designs and
acquiring additional right-of-way, these sections would be constructed as
concrete lined canals. RID's current policy is to be more selective in the
use of concrete lining, which is now adopted only in areas where excessive
seepage and water loss appears likely. The lateral canals would be mostly
unlined except for an estimated 20% which pass through areas where permeable
subsoils might be encountered. The topography of the area is generally
favorable for canal construction and soils are easily excavated and suited to
use in the canal embankments. The only major conveyance structure is a 600 m
long concrete flume where the Right Main Canal crosses a tributary of the Lam
Pao River. Service roads would be constructed along all main and lateral
canals with widths ranging from 5 m on the Lam Pao main canal to 3 m on the
smaller laterals. The roads would be paved with a 20 cm layer of compacted
laterite.
3.04      The layout and design of tertiary canals would follow the standards
developed in the ongoing Stage I project. Each turnout from the lateral
canals would serve about 50 ha. Tertiary canals would be aligned as far as
possible along property lines to minimize exchange or reallocation of holdings.
A farm turnout from the tertiaries would be provided to serve two or three
holdings and the density of tertiary canals would be about 40 m per ha. Farm
roads, about 2.5 m wide, would be provided along about 20% of the tertiaries
to supplement the existing roads and trails linking the villages to the farms.
RID and its consultants considered the possibility of "land consolidation," a
mode of development adopted in the Bank-financed Chao Phya Improvement
Project (Cr. 379-TH) which includes land leveling, boundary realignment and
construction of a rectanguLar grid of tertiary canals, drains, and farm
roads.  However, this option was ruled out because the steeper slopes in the
Northeast would involve considerably more earth moving, and in addition to
the higher costs this would disturb the thin layer of topsoil typical of the
project areas.
3.05      Similar tertiary systems have been constructed on about 17,500 ha
in the Stage I project area and the results have been encouraging with
dry-season cropping intensities in individual tertiary blocks reaching 60% to



- 10 -
70% in the second year after construction. The farmers, however, are at
present reluctant to give up their land for the construction of tertiary
drains. This, in part, is because there is adequate slope in most areas for
effective field-to-field drainage of excess rainfall which generally occurs
during the later growth stage of the wet-season rice crop. However, drains
have been included in the design of the tertiary systems and could be con-
structed in the future if farmers become convinced of the need for them.
3.06      The main drainage system would consist primarily of widening and
deepening existing natural drains, but some new drains would be constructed
in low-lying areas. Some of the natural drains to be improved originate in
the Stage I area, and their improvement was deferred so that the entire
length of the drains could be developed under the Stage II project. The
total length of drains would be about 150 km. The main drains would discharge
into the channels of the Lam Pao and its tributaries. Since construction of
the Lam Pao Reservoir, the frequency and magnitude of floods in the Lam Pao
have been considerably reduced but, following widespread rainfall, drainage
from the project would continue to be impeded at times because of uncontrolled
runoff in the tributaries and by floods in the Nam Chi which forms the
southern boundary of the project area.
3.07      Lam Takhong.  The service area of the Lam Takhong project is
divided into two zones (M4ap 13080). The Upper Zone extends about 45 km down-
stream from the Lam Takhong Dam and has an irrigable area of about 8,500 ha.
There are no formal irrigation systems in the Upper Zone but lands close to
the river are presently irrigated by about 300 farmer-owned bamboo diversion
weirs, pumps, and water wheels.  The proposed project includes the construc-
tion of two diversion dams and associated canals to irrigate 6,200 ha
in the Upper Zone.  The remaining 2,300 ha, a narrow strip of land extending
20 km below the dam, would continue to be served mainly by pumps installed by
RID which irrigate about 1,200 ha in the wet season and 600 ha in the dry
season. The new systems would replace most of the farmers' diversions which
are costly to maintain and operate. Improved water control in the upper
reaches would also make it possible to deliver more timely and dependable
flows to existing downstream systems, constructed in the 1940s, which serve
13,500 ha in the Lower Zone. These systems would be improved to permit more
effective operation and maintenance.
3.08      In the Upper Zone of Lam Takhong, two diversion dams would be
constructed in the main channel of the river. The first, about 20 km from
the reservoir, would supply canals serving 2,600 ha, and the second about 8 km
further downstream would serve 3,600 ha. The dams would be low concrete weirs
with four 6 m gate openings controlled by 6 m x 5 m radial gates. There are
nine existing diversion dams in the Lower Zone. Improvement of these would
consist of overhauling the gates and repairing the stone protection. At six
of the dams the height of gates would be increased by 0.3 to 0.6 rn to raise
the full supply levels in the canals supplied from the dams.
3.09      About 60 km of new main canals would be constructed in the Upper
Zone, of which 20 km or some 30% traverse irregular topography and cross
numerous streams where particular attention will be given to cross-drainage



- 11 -
works, but the remainder are located in generally flat terrain. In the Lower
Zone there are 110 km of existing canals. There are 11 main canals serving
areas of 1,000 to 2,000 ha and which function essentially as laterals. The
canals would be cleared of weeds and sediment and existing control structures
would be improved and in some cases replaced.  Manually operated control
gates would be installed on all structures. The service roads are in poor
condition and new roads would be constructed to the standards described in
para. 3.03. Turn outs from the main canals would be repaired and replaced.
3.10      The tertiary system for the Upper Zone would be similar to that
described for Lam Pao (para. 3.04). In the Lower Zone, tertiary development
would be limited to improvements of existing tertiaries and construction of
about 100 km of new tertiary canals. A higher standard of development is not
justified for this area since it is limited by water availability to a
single wet-season rice crop.
3.11      The main drains in the Upper Zone would outfall into the Lam Takhong
and its tributaries below the diversion dams. High river stages which would
impede drainage are infrequent since the Lam Takhong Dam was built. The
total length of drains in the Upper Zone would be about 40 km. In the Lower
Zone, about 50 km of new drains would be constructed to carry excess rainfall
from the project area to a network of natural channels.
Water Supply, Demand and Quality
3.12      Lam Pao.  The Lam Pao has a catchment area above the dam site of
5,430 sq km and its average annual runoff is 1,540 MCM. The reservoir has
an active storage capacity of 1,260 MCM. Reservoir operation studies have
been carried out to assess the capability of the reservoir to regulate the
Lam Pao and meet irrigation demands for an annual cropping intensity of 160%
on an irrigable area of 50,000 ha. Monthly inflows for a period of 39 years
were used in the study. The sequence of reservoir inflows included 10 years
of recorded flows (1957-66), 7 years of flows derived from reservoir operating
data, and 22 years derived from rainfall runoff correlations.
3.13      For each year of the sequence, the recorded rainfall in the project
area was used in deriving monthly irrigation demands. These demands were
calculated for the cropping patterns and the crop calendar shown in Chart
17862 and described in Chapter 5. Water requirements for land preparation
and crop irrigation (crop consumptive use minus effective rainfall plus
percolation losses) were calculated for ten-day periods and then converted to
monthly values for use in the operation studies.  Crop consumptive use was
determined by Haise-Jensen values of evapotranspiration multiplied by crop
factors. Effective rainfall, derived by a water-balance study for the
growing season, averaged about 75% of actual rainfall.  Percolation losses of
60 mm per month were assumed. The diversion requirements for an average
rainfall year amount to about 7,000 cu m/ha and 11,000 cu m/ ha for wet-
season and dry-season paddy respectively. For peanuts the dry-season diver-
sion requirement is 5,500 cu m/ha. Crop irrigation requirements were con-
verted to demands at the reservoir outlets (diversion requirements) by
applying the efficiency factors listed below:



- 12 -
Main and lateral canals            85%
Tertiary systems                   80%
Farm efficiency:
Paddy                            85%
Other crops                     75%
Overall efficiency:
Paddy                            58%
Other crops                     51%
3.14      The operation studies showed that irrigation shortages would be
confined to the dry season and would occur in only 5 years of the 39-year
sequence. Shortages would range from 10% to 30% of dry-season demands.
In practice, low reservoir levels at the beginning of the dry season would
give advance warning of water shortages and the farmers could be advised
to plant a larger proportion of land to crops with low water requirements
such as peanuts and mung beans. Given that shortages would be predictable and
could be managed by shifts in the cropping pattern, a higher long-term
cropping intensity than 160% may be attainable. But, in view of the short
period of actual flow records used in the operation studies, an annual
intensity of 160% has been used for purposes of project evaluation.
3.15      Lam Takhong.  At the dam site the Lam Takhong has a catchment area
of 1,340 sq km and its average annual runoff is 250 MCM. The reservoir has
an active storage capacity of 290 MCM. Reservoir operation studies cover a
period of 44 years. This sequence of monthly reservoir inflows includes
7 years of recorded flows (1962-68), 6 years of flows derived from reservoir
operating data, and 31 years of flows derived from rainfall-runoff correla-
tions. Procedures and assumptions for the operation studies are as described
for the Lam Pao project. Shortages occur in four years of the sequence with
demands based on irrigation of 100% of the Upper and Lower Zones in the wet
season, a dry-season cropped area of 5,100 ha (including pump irrigated areas
see para. 3.07) in the Upper Zone, and demands for Korat water supply of
24 MCM/year. These shortages all occur following years of abnormally low
runoff such as experienced in 1968 when the annual runoff of 108 MCM was 43%
of the average. The dry-season cropped area would, of course, vary from year
to year depending on the water available in the reservoir but a dry-season-
cropped area of 4,600 ha together with wet-season irrigation of 20,000 ha is
considered a reasonable basis for project evaluation.
3.16      The city of Korat (Map 13080) with a present population of about
85,000, draws its water from an intake on an arm of the Lam Takhong. For two
or three months in the dry season the river at the intake dries up and water
has to be released from the Lam Takhong reservoir.  Although Korat's present
demand is only about 0.6 MCM/month, a much larger volume has to be released
because of the numerous uncontrolled diversions in the 65 km of river channel
between the reservoir and Korat. In future the flows from tributaries of the
Lam Takhong will be further depleted by storage dams and diversion weirs now
being built, at the same time Korat's demands will continue to grow. Therefore,
a growing portion of Korat's demands will have to be supplied from the Lam
Takhong reservoir. In order to eliminate the problem of routing reservoir
releases along the river channel, and to ensure a reliable supply for Korat,
the Government has for some years been considering the construction of a
pipeline from the reservoir to the city. Alternatives to a pipeline are
not promising. The geology of the Korat Plateau is generally unfavorable for
groundwater development and wells with large and sustained yields are rare.



- 13 -
Some damsites on tributaries nearer to Korat than the Lam Takhong reservoir
have been identified but these can be ruled out because of very high reservoir
compensation costs. A further advantage of a pipeline is that it could supply
the three district towns close to the national highway running from the
damsite to Korat. It is estimated that by the year 2000 the pipeline would
serve a population of about 240,000 together with numerous commercial and
manufacturing establishments and the annual demand to be supplied by the
pipeline would be about 16 MCM (a more conservative figure of 24 MCM was used
in the operation studies). The estimated cost of the pipeline and related
works would be about US$7 million.
3.17      At present, releases from the reservoir in the early part of the
dry season sometimes far exceed Korat's requirements in order to compensate
for losses and diversions from the river. As a result, water is wasted when
the irrigation requirements are low early in the dry season. This problem
would be eased but not overcome when the proposed canal system replaces the
numerous farmer diversions. Thus, even with a higher degree of control over
irrigation diversions, a direct supply to Korat would still be needed to
avoid inefficient operation. Therefore, a feasibility study (and any necessary
design work) to determine the appropriate means of supplying water to Korat
would be included in the project. The Government is formulating a plan to
establish a Provincial Water Supply Authority, which would eventually deal
with such projects. Until this agency is established, a committee composed
of representatives of RID, NESDB, the Department of Public Works (Ministry of
Interior) and other concerned agencies, would be formed to initiate the
feasibility study and review recommendations. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that the Government would: (a) prepare and submit to the
Bank and IFAD by June 30, 1980, a plan, including at implementation schedule,
to meet Korat's future water demands, and (b) take all necessary steps to
insure that the plan is implemented in a timely manner. Any consulting
services to carry out the required studies and to prepare designs and contract
documents would be financed from the project.
3.18      Preparation of Future Irrigation Projects.  The Government has
requested that provision be made in the loan for financing the detailed
preparation of other irrigation projects. These projects would be selected
and the scope of studies decided by the Royal Irrigation Department after
consultation with the Bank. A project already identified as having high
priority for detailed preparation is the Nam Mun Project in Northeast Thai-
land. This includes two dams on the headwaters of the Nam Mun (Map 10305R)
which would irrigate about 20,000 ha. The project costs and benefits as pre-
sented in a USBR feasibility study of 1972 would be updated. Subject to con-
firmation of the project's economic viability, detailed designs and contract
documents would be prepared for the two dams and for the initial stages of
the irrigation system.  A further activity would be the preparation of de-
tailed designs and contract documents for selected medium-scale irrigation
projects. Studies to identify and select such projects and to assess their
priority are to be carried out by consultants employed by RID and financed
under the Phitsanulok Project (Loan 1149-TH).  Consulting services to be fi-
nanced under this project would, as is the case of other projects in Thailand,
usually be provided by foreign firms in association with local consultants.



-14 -
Project Implementation
3.19      The project would be constructed over a period of five and a half
years beginning with the right main canal at Lam Pao in the 1978/79 dry
season (Charts 18278 & 18279).  Construction of main and lateral canals
would proceed throughout the year, but earthinoving operations would be
slowed down and sometimes suspended for short periods during the wet season
(June through September). Work on tertiary canals would be confined to the
dry season to avoid interference with the wet season crop. At Lam Pao,
where the left bank main canal has been completed over most of its length,
construction of laterals and tertiaries would begin in November 1979 on a
block of about 3,000 ha served by this canal. Thereafter, construction of
successive blocks of about 3,500 ha would begin each year. Each block is
expected to be completed in two working seasons. A similar procedure would
be followed on the right bank with construction of the first unit also
starting in November 1979. Design and construction of all the laterals and
tertiaries in a block would proceed in parallel. This is in contrast to the
normal practice in Thailand of completing the laterals and then constructing
the tertiaries. RID intends to adopt this approach so that irrigation
benefits will begin to accrue shortly after investments are made.
3.20      Work on the Upper Zone of Lam Takhong would begin in October 1979
with a start on the first of the two diversion dams with its associated canal
system. The diversion dams and irrigation systems are expected to be completed
in about three years. Rehabilitation of the Lower Zone facilities would take
about three years beginning in late 1979.
3.21      A major part of the project's civil works would be carried out by
contract in line with RID's current policy of reducing the share of its con-
struction program carried out by force account. However, improvement of
existing systems at Lam Takhong and the construction of drains in both
project areas would be executed by force account since the scope of work is
best defined in the field as the work proceeds. Also, the first lateral/
tertiary blocks at Lam Pao would be constructed by force account since it
would not be possible to prepare contract documents and complete procurement
procedures before the start of the 1979/80 working season.
Status of Designs
3.22      The alignment of the main canals and laterals and the location of
major structures are based on 1:10,000 scale maps, and quantities are based
primarily on profiles and cross-sections along the main canals and most of
the laterals. Detailed designs for the project works would be based on 1 to
4,000 scale maps.  Mapping for the Lam Takhong area has been completed
and mapping for the Lam Pao area will be completed in July 1979. Detailed
designs have been completed for the Lam Pao main canal system. Semi-detailed
designs have been prepared for the Lam Takhong (Upper Zone) main canal
system. Quantities for tertiary development are based on detailed designs
for similar areas in the Stage I project of Lam Pao.

Cost Estimates
3.23      Total project costs in January 1979 prices are estimated at
US$80 million with a foreign exchange component of US$35 million, or 44%
of the total cost. Construction costs are based on quantity and unit price
estimates prepared by RID and include about 10% for taxes and duties. Unit
prices are in line with recent bid prices for similar work in Thailand
updated to January 1979. Details of the cost estimate showing quantities and
unit prices for the major work items are shown in Annex 1. Minor items and
miscellaneous costs are accounted for by an allowance of 10% for unlisted
items. Physical contingencies of 15% have been added to all civil works and
equipment costs. Estimated price increases were derived by applying the
following annual rates of price escalation: for civil works 9% through 1979
and 8% thereafter and for equipment and services 7.5% through 1979 and 7%
thereafter. Expected price increases amount to US$16.4 million, or 26% of
base cost plus physical contingencies. A summary of project costs is shown
in Table 3.1 and further details are given in Annex 1.
Financing
3.24      The Bank loan of US$17.5 million and an IFAD loan of US$17.5 million
would jointly finance the foreign exchange requirement of the project. The
proposed IFAD loan would be administered by the Bank acting as a Cooperative
Institution under terms of the Cooperative Agreement between IFAD and the
Bank dated May 20, 1978. The Government's contribution of US$45 million
(B 917 million) would finance the balance of project costs through annual
budgetary allocations to the Royal Irrigation Department.

Procurement
3.25      The division of work between force account and contracts would
be approximately as shown below (figures in parentheses denote number of
contracts).

3.26      The value of civil works contracts would range between US$0.5 and
US$6.0 million (including physical contingencies and expected price increases).
The size and phasing of contracts are dictated largely by the rate at which
detailed designs and contracts can be prepared. Experience in Thailand has
shown that such contracts are probably too small to be of interest to interna-
tional contractors. Therefore, these contracts would be awarded following
competitive bidding advertised locally; foreign firms would be eligible to
bid. Contracts would be advertised in Thai and English in the local press
and documents would be in English. RID's contracting procedures, which have
been followed on several Bank-assisted projects to date, are satisfactory.
Bid evaluation procedures for local competitive bidding would follow Chapter
III of the Bank's Guidelines.
3.27      Most vehicles and equipment (US$3.8 million) would be procured
following international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group
Guidelines. A 15% preference margin, or the prevailing customs duty if
lower, would be extended to local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids.
Vehicles and equipment costing less than US$20,000 each and limited to a
total of US$300,000, which are not suitable for international tendering,
would be purchased through normal government procurement procedures (local
competitive bidding or competitive quotations) which ensure adequate compe-
tition.



- 17 -
3.28      There have been numerous cases where procurement for Bank-financed
irrigation projects has been delayed by RID's internal procedures and by
complicated clearance procedures in other government agencies. Although
delays cannot be ruled out in the future, there have been encouraging signs
that most of the problems have been identified and resolved.
Disbursements
3.29      Disbursements from the Bank loan and the IFAD loan, apportioned
50:50 against each withdrawal application would be made at the rate of 100%
against the foreign exchange cost of directly imported vehicles and equipment,
or the ex-factory price net of taxes for items manufactured locally, and at a
rate of 65% of total costs for imported items procured locally. For consultants'
services, disbursements would equal 100% of total expenditures. Disburse-
ments for civil works would be at 42% of total expenditures, to be disbursed
against periodic contractors progress payments, or in the case of force
account works, against certificates of expenditure, the documentation for
which would be retained by the borrower and made available for inspection by
the Bank's supervision missions. It is expected that disbursements would
be completed by June 30, 1985. Estimated schedules of expenditures,
disbursements and the proposed allocation of the proceeds of the loans are
presented in Annex 1.
Accounts and Audits
3.30      Assurances were obtained that RID would maintain separate accounts
for the project; would employ independent auditors, acceptable to the Bank
and IFAD, to audit project accounts annually; and would send the audited
accounts, together with the auditor's comments, to the Bank and to IFAD
within four months of the close of each financial year.
Environmental Effects
3.31      The project would have a beneficial effect on the environment by
providing a year-round water supply in an area presently dependent on uncer-
tain rainfall. Its adverse effects would not be significant. The project
areas are already flooded for paddy cultivation for about six months every year
so that double cropping would not greatly increase exposure of the farmers to
water-borne diseases or malaria. The canals would not be used for drinking
water since the villagers rely on wells and rainwater for domestic use.
Schistosomiasis is not present in the project area. Chemicals to control
pests and diseases are used sparingly by Thai farmers. Also a major emphasis
in Thailand's rice breeding program is to produce disease and pest resistant
varieties. The fish life which might be affected by agricultural chemicals
is not a significant source of food in the project areas.
4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Project Management
4.01      The Royal Irrigation Department (RID) would be responsible for
project implementation. RID is now organized in 22 functional divisions



- 18 -
and 12 regional offices under a Director General (Chart 16264[R]). Three
Deputy Directors General and two Chief Engineers assist the Director General
in the management of the Department. RID, together with most of the govern-
ment agencies serving agriculture, fall under the Ministry of Agriculture
and Cooperatives (Chart 16265).
4.02      For recent Bank-financed irrigation projects, RID has adopted
a system of project management which is aimed at placing all aspects of
project implementation under the control of a Project Manager reporting to a
Deputy Director-General who serves as Project Director. A similar system
would be adopted for the proposed project. For the Northeast Thailand
Irrigation Improvement Project (Cr. 461-TH), a Deputy Director General acts
as Project Director responsible for overall direction of the project. A
Project Manager is responsible for day to day management and for coordination
with the project consultant, the functional divisions, and other government
agencies. Work in each of the project areas is under the supervision of a
Project Engineer. While much of the work continues to be done by the dif-
ferent organizational units, their activities are coordinated and carried out
in a logical sequence. Procurement problems, sometimes beyond the control of
those responsible for project management, have delayed the project but
recently there has been a marked improvement in progress with a steady
increase in the area benefiting from irrigation.
4.03      RID intends to adopt the same organizational arrangements for
the proposed project as for the project financed under Credit 461-TH.
As far as possible the same key officials would be retained but with additional
staff to handle the extra work load during the time when both projects
are being implemented. Project Engineers would be appointed for Lam Pao and
for the Upper and Lower Zones at Lam Takhong to coordinate field operations
in their respective project areas. An assurance was obtained that the duties
of the Project Director and Project Manager for Credit 461-TH would be
extended to cover the proposed project, and three Project Engineers would be
appointed.
4.04      Design staff would be assigned to the project by the Central Design
Division, with overall supervision provided by the Division's senior design-
ers.  Force account construction at Lam Pao for parts of the main canals and
for the main and secondary drains, together with supervision of contractors
on the main canals would be the responsibility of the Large Projects
Construction Division.  The Operation and Maintenance Division, through its
On-Farm Development Branch, has traditionally carried out tertiary system
construction in Thailand and would be responsible for the lateral/tertiary
blocks scheduled for force account construction at Lam Pao and for the
supervision of contract work at Lam Pao and Lam Takhong including the diver-
sion dams.
Consulting Services
4.05      Consultants (a foreign firm in association with local consultants)
would be retained to assist RID in the preparation of designs and contract
documents, in the supervision of construction, to provide guidance in estab-
lishing operation and maintenance procedures, and to assist in project



- 19 -
monitoring and evaluation. Included in the consultant's team would be a
water management specialist, who would assist RID in advising farmers on the
efficient use of irrigation facilities. The estimated total consultant input
is 160 man-months of expatriate staff and 500 man-months of local engineers
and technicians. The estimated cost for expatriate consultants is US$7,500
per man-month, including international transportation. An assurance was
obtained that consultants engaged by RID for project implementation and
preparation of future projects (para. 3.18) would be employed on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank and to IFAD.
Right-of-way
4.06      Land acquisition for right-of-way has been completed in respect of
the main canal system for the Lam Pao area. No problems are anticipated in
acquiring land in the Lam Takhong area. In the Stage I project area farmers
have cooperated with RID in providing right-of-way for tertiary canals. No
boundary realignment is involved, and farmers are given the opportunity to
provide labor for construction in the dry season as an added incentive. With
similar conditions in the proposed project area, farmers are expected to be
equally cooperative.
Agricultural Supporting Services
4.07      Extension.  The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) is
primarily responsible for providing agricultural advice to farmers in the
project areas. At present the project areas have only one extension worker
for every 4,500 farm families. Under the Northeast Irrigation Improvement
Project, Stage I (Cr. 461-TH), an improved extension service has been intro-
duced, using leading farmers as part-time extension workers (farmers' foremen),
under the supervision of extension officers of DAE. Both Stage I and the
proposed Stage II project areas are due to be incorporated in the National
Extension Project (Ln. 1393-TH) in 1980. At that time farmers' foremen will
be replaced by full-time extension agents (EAs). The national project is
based on staffing at a ratic) of one EA to 1,000 farm families.
4.08      Research.  A number of research stations are located in, or near
to the project areas. These! include the Khon Kaen and Phi Mai rice experi-
ment stations, operated by the Rice Research Division of the Ministry of
Agriculture. The work on th,ese stations is focused on varietal screening,
fertilizer trials and seed multiplication. Similar work with upland crops,
including both peanuts and mung bean, is conducted on the FAO Experiment
and Demonstration Farm located in the Lam Pao subproject area. In addition
RID operates its own crop experiment station near Korat, adjacent to Lam
Takhong. Between them, these stations provide a sound technological base for
the project.
4.09      Fertilizers.  Under prevailing conditions there is little use of
fertilizer in the project areas. Fertilizer consumption in the Stage I
project areas, however, is increasing as a result of improved irrigation and
extension. At full development the project would require about 19,600 tons
of fertilizer. Ammophos (16:20:0) would account for 62% of the total require-
ment and urea, muriate of potash and triple superphosphate for 19%, 12% and



- 20 -
7% respectively. Commercial channels for the distribution of fertilizers are
well established. Private dealers and storekeeers would have no difficulty in
meeting the demand.
4.10      Seeds.  At full development the project would use approximately
2,500 tons of rice seed per annum of which 80% would be of high-yielding
varieties. In addition some 650 tons of peanut seed and 185 tons of mung
bean seed would be required annually. Assuming that all seeds would be
replaced every five years, the estimated annual requirement of certified seed
for the project area at full development would amount to 500 tons of rice,
130 tons of peanuts and 40 tons of mung bean. Seed processing facilities
will be strengthened by the establishment of a seed center at Khon Kaen in
1978, under a USAID-financed National Seeds Project and no problems are
anticipated in meeting the project's seed requirement.
4.11      Credit.  At present farmers in the project areas rely almost
entirely on noninstitutional sources of credit, mainly from relatives,
friends, or local merchants. With the existing low level of farm inputs,
credit needs are primarily for consumption. However, irrigation development
will result in a substantial demand for short-term production credit which
would be met mainly from institutional sources. The annual requirement for
short-term credit is expected to increase from B 20 million to B 166 million
at full development. The Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives
(BAAC) would be the main source of institutional credit. BAAC already has
the necessary infrastructure with branch offices in all districts covered by
the project area. An assurance was obtained that BAAC would make available
additional staff and funds needed to meet the credit requirements of the
farmers in the project areas.
Operation and Maintenance
4.12      RID would be responsible for the operation and maintenance of
the dams, the irrigation system down to the tertiary outlets, and the drain-
age system. Consultant assistance would be available for developing O&M
procedures for the project. An assurance was obtained that RID would operate
and maintain the irrigation facilities in accordance with sound engineering
standards.
4.13      Operation and maintenance of the systems within the tertiary
command area would be the responsibility of the farmers themselves, organized
into water users' associations. The farmers in each group would elect
a common irrigator who would be responsible for operating the on-farm works
and for ensuring that maintenance is carried out. The informal water user
groups in the completed areas of the ongoing Northeast Irrigation Improvement
Project are working quite well in maintaining and operating the systems.
But, formally established groups would be better able to handle disputes and
operate the systems more efficiently. The Ministry is presently drafting
legislation to strengthen RID's legal powers to establish farmer groups and
to enforce water use discipline. RID, with consultant assistance, would
promote the establishment of water users' associations in both project areas
and provide them with technical assistance. The annual cost of operating and



- 21 -
maintaining the facilities for which RID would be responsible is estimated at
US$12 per ha on average.  The cost of O&M of the on-farm works is estimated
at US$3/ha/yr.
Safety of Dams
4.14      Although the existing Lam Pao and Lam Takhong dams were built
without Bank financing, bot'h structures would be essential to the success
of the proposed project. RID is responsible for operation and maintenance.
An assurance was obtained that the Government would make arrangements
satisfactory to the Bank and to IFAD for the two dams to be periodically
inspected in accordance with sound engineering practice in order to ensure
that no deficiencies occur in their condition, or in the quality and adequacy
of maintenance or methods of operation, which may endanger their safety; and
that the Government would submit such arrangements to the Bank and to IFAD
for review by December 1979.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.15      The Irrigated Agriculture Branch of RID's O&M division which
is already engaged in the collection of crop statistics for all irrigation
projects would be responsible for monitoring the proposed project. Data
collection would be expanded to include measurements of input use, changes in
cropping patterns, and farm incomes, as well as crop yields. The Government
is considering employing the National Institute of Development Administration
(NIDA) to assist RID in the collection and analysis of data.
5. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
Present Cropping Patterns
5.01      Virtually all cultivable land in the project area is cultivated to
rice during the wet season. The Lam Pao area is entirely rainfed. At Lam
Takhong Upper Zone, about 1,300 out of 8,500 ha are irrigated, while the
13,500 ha in the Lower Zone are partially irrigated in the wet season from
the existing system. Dry-season cropping is confined to upland crops, mainly
peanuts and mung bean, grown on the 1,300 ha irrigated in the Upper Zone of
Lam Takhong.
5.02      Wet-season rice iLs grown between May and December.  Virtually all
rice is transplanted from field nurseries onto previously puddled land. In
most cases land preparation is done using animal power. Unreliable rainfall
at the start of the wet season frequently causes delays in the planting
program and transplanting often continues from June through August. The
crop is harvested in November and December. Photosensitive, local varieties
are grown throughout the project areas. Most of the rice grown in Lam Pao is
glutinous, whereas at Lam Takhong nonglutinous rice is preferred. Very few
farmers use any fertilizers or insecticides and yields are low, about 1.5 to
2.0 tons/ha.



- 22 -
5.03      Peanuts and mung bean in the Upper Zone of Lam Takhong are planted
at the beginning of the dry season after the rice harvest in December. Both
crops appear promising on the better drained soils but inadequate land
preparation and poor water control depress yields. Mung bean matures in
about 80 days and is harvested in March, while peanuts mature about two months
later.
Future Cropping Patterns
5.04      In the absence of the project there would be no significant change
in cropping patterns. Similarly, existing cropping intensities would be
unchanged in the absence of improvement or extension of irrigation facilities.
5.05      The expected changes in the cropping pattern and production, with
the project, are shown in Tables 5.1 and 5.2. With the project, 51,300 ha
would be provided with irrigation in the wet season and dry-season cropping
would increase from 1,300 ha at present to 23,500 ha. Cropping intensities
would increase from 85% to 160% in Lam Pao and from 117% to 174% in the Upper
Zone of Lam Takhong. Limited water for irrigation would restrict cropping in
the Lower Zone of Lam Takhong to the wet season only. Rice would remain the
dominant crop and would be the sole crop grown throughout the project during
the wet season. A reliable water supply would enable farmers to shift from
local varieties to high-yielding, semi-dwarf varieties (HYVs). In the wet
season about 60% of the project area would be planted to HYVs in areas free
from flooding. The remaining 40% would be local varieties which the farmers
prefer for their own consumption because of better cooking quality and
palatability. In the dry season about 46% of the total project area would be
cropped. HYVs would be grown on about half the cultivated area and peanuts
and mung bean on the remainder.
5.06      The proposed cropping pattern is consistent with soils and
topography and with the national strategy of growing more rice for domestic
consumption and export. The inclusion of legumes would exploit export
opportunities for these crops and reduce Thailand's dependence on imported
vegetable oils.
Yields and Production
5.07      Present and projected crop yields are shown in Table 5.3.  With good
water control, improved extension service, and adequate supplies of credit
and inputs, projected yields would be reached seven years after completing
construction and rehabilitation of the systems. This is a longer period
than for similar projects in the Central Plain of Thailand due to the lower
existing yields and generally less developed agriculture in the Northeast.
Projections are based on yields presently achieved under irrigation by pro-
gressive farmers in the Stage I project areas, and on research results adjusted
to field conditions. Future paddy yields in the Lower Zone of Lam Takhong are
estimated to be 3 ton/ha only, reflecting the lower intensity of tertiary
canals and possible uncertainties in water supply delivered to the Lower Zone
from the reservoir. Crop yields in the Lam Takhong Upper Zone are expected to
be higher than in Lam Pao due to better soils.

5.08      Increased paddy yields of both local varieties and HYVs would be
obtained by better land preparation, irrigation, use of good quality seed,
heavier fertilizer input and greater expenditure on crop protection and weed
control. The Department of Agriculture has developed improved varieties of
peanut and mung bean. Increases in the yields of these crops would be achieved
through the use of good quality seed combined with improved cultivation and
planting techniques, and better weed control and plant protection.
5.09      As a result of the project paddy production would increase from about
83,600 tons at present to 225,000 tons at full development. Peanut production
would increase from 1,400 tons to 19,300 tons and mung bean from 400 tons to
5,100 tons.
Cropping Calendar
5.10      Chart No. 17862 shows a proposed crop calendar.  The main difference
between the proposed calendar and existing practice is the introduction of
dry-season cropping over much of the project area in the period January-June.
With reliable irrigation, the farmers would transplant their wet-season paddy
crop in July/August and harvest in November/December in contrast to the
present situation in which the date of transplanting varies considerably
according to rainfall. Dry season paddy and upland crops would be planted in
January. Mung bean would be harvested in late March and paddy and peanuts in
May/June. The proposed calendar allows for a 30-day closure of canals for
maintenance in December.

Farm Mechanization
5.11      Virtually all land preparation is now done by animal-drawn equip-
ment. With improved water management, better access to fields, the need for
tighter operating schedules to maximize water use and increased cropping
intensities, it is estimated that 50% of land preparation in the wet season
and 80% in the dry season would be mechanical. The machinery, mostly two-
wheel tractors and rotary tillers, would either be owned by farmers or rented
from their neighbors. On the larger plots, four-wheel tractors, which are
readily available in the project areas, would be used for contract plowing.
Paddy is currently harvested by sickle. Threshing is done manually either in
the field or at threshing sites in the villages. With the project, it is
assumed that most of the threshing would continue to be by hand, but some
threshers run by power tillers may be used.
Drying, Storage and Processing
5.12      At present threshed paddy is sun-dried on whatever suitable surfaces
are available. Some of the rice mills have concrete drying floors. Existing
arrangements appear adequate for the present paddy crop. At full development
80% of paddy production would be from the wet-season crop. This should not
cause drying problems as harvest would take place mainly in the dry months of
November and December. The remaining 20% from the dry-season crop would be
harvested in the relatively wetter May-June period. Rainfall at this time,
however, is largely confined to infrequent heavy showers of short duration
and ample opportunity exists for sun-drying during this period. Storage
capacity in the project area is ample for present production, but would need
some expansion to accommodate increased yields. There are over 2,000
privately owned rice mills and hullers in the project areas. Data on the
total milling capacity is lacking but at present the total capacity is
underutilized. However, since these mills also cater to the needs of farmers
outside the project areas, additional milling capacity would probably be
required at full development. The private sector can be expected to meet
storage and milling requirements without difficulty.

6. MARKET, PRICES, INCOMES AND PROJECT CHARGES
Market Prospects
6.01      Over the past 15 years domestic consumption of rice in Thailand
increased at a little over 3% a year while production increased at less than
3% per annum.  Exports over the same period have declined; Thailand's share
of world exports fell from 20% in the early 1960s to about 15% in the mid-1970s.
The volume of exports in 1977, however, was above the average for the ten
year period 1967-76. The incremental project production of 93,500 tons of
milled rice constitutes a 3% increase in output for the Northeast region. In
view of projected increases in domestic and overseas demand there will be no
difficulty in selling this amount.
6.02      In the Lam Pao project, 90% or more of the rice area is planted
to glutinous varieties. Domestic demand for glutinous rice is largely
confined to 16 provinces in North and Northeast Thailand and will increase in
line with population growth. Export demand for glutinous-rice is limited and
is expected to remain at present levels. It is expected that as the farmers
in Lam Pao increase their marketable surplus because of irrigation they will
grow more non-glutinous rice. Farmers in the Lam Takhong area currently
produce non-glutinous rice and will continue to do so in future.
6.03      Ready markets exist for the project's incremental rice production.
Farmers in the project area may market their surplus paddy to merchants or
millers. Glutinous rice is marketed mainly in the Northeast. Farmers at Lam
Takhong will receive slightly higher farm-gate prices for non-glutinuous rice
than farmers at Lam Pao because of lower transport costs to Bangkok.
6.04      At present, farmers have no difficulty in disposing of peanuts at
attractive prices. Increasing domestic consumption of high-quality vegetable
oils, continued growth in demand for confectionary peanuts, and favorable
export prospects in neighboring countries are likely to ensure good market
conditions for producers in the future.
6.05      The peanut oil processing capacity in the Northeast is negligible
and most of the output is shipped to Bangkok. With the volume of production
forecast for the future, several of the processing companies are considering
construction of a plant near the Lam Pao project area. This could lead to
higher farm-gate prices and greater price stability through processor-producer
contracts.
6.06      The market prospects for mungbeans are equally favorable.  There is
a strong domestic market and good prospects for growth of the export market.
Prices
6.07      The price structure for rice and paddy used in the financial and
economic analyses is presented in Table 6.1. The present and future prices
are based on the Bank's commodity price forecasts weighted to reflect the
actual composition of exports by grade and expressed in January 1979
constant prices. The present and future weighted average f.o.b. export



- 29 -
prices are US$335/ton and US$375/ton, corresponding to financial farm-gate
prices of B 3,135/ton and B 3,355/ton, respectively. Export prices are
largely determined by market forces, although the composition of exports
by grade in a given year is greatly influenced by weather conditions at
harvest time. Government intervention in the form of the rice premium and
other export taxes tends to depress farmgate prices.

- 30 -
6.08      The present and future economic prices were derived by taking the
same weighted average f.o.b. export prices and working back to the farm-gate,
excluding all taxes and adjusting domestic costs by applying specific conver-
sion factors to state all local costs in terms of their border price equiva-
lents (para. 7.03). The resulting economic farmgate prices are B 3,960/ton
and B 4,320/ton for present and future (in terms of January 1979 constant
prices).  The price of glutinous rice in the future will maintain the histo-
rical relationship to non-glutinous rice prices that have held in the past.
Financial and economic prices for other crops in the project area as well as
major inputs were derived in a similar manner and are summarized in Table
6.2.

Farm Incomes
6.09      Farm budgets have been prepared for five farm models, representing
typical farms of different sizes in the two project areas. The models for
Lam Pao are 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 ha and for Lam Takhong, 1.8 ha in the Upper and
Lower Zones (reflecting the differences in dry-season cropping in the two
zones). Farmers at Lam Pao generally have, in addition to their holding in
the project area, additionaLl land ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 ha on which they
grow cassava or other upland crops.
6.10      In the farm models, it is assumed that family labor contributes 54
man-days/month to the project holdings. Hired labor is generally used only
in the peak months - July/August for transplanting and November for harvest-
ing - and is costed at B 15/day. Project charges at the levels shown in
para. 6.17 have been assumed in the farm budget analysis.
6.11      The results of the farm budget analysis, presented in Table 6.3,
show almost a four-fold increase in farm incomes for Lam Pao and more than
doubling in the Upper Zone of Lam Takhong. In the Lower Zone of Lam Takhong,
where there will be no dry season cropping even with the project, incomes
will still increase substantially mainly due to the provision of a more
reliable water supply.

6.12      The Bank estimated that the relative poverty income level in rural
Thailand in 1976 was US$93/capita. Using the index of international inflation
and assuming a 4% annual increase in real personal income, the 1979 and 1991
relative poverty levels are estimated to be US$130 and US$220, respectively.
Based on the farm models tested, it is estimated that at present about 90% of
the farmers in the project areas have incomes less than the poverty level,
comDared with 40% of the rural population nationally. Without the project,
the relative income situation is likely to remain the same or even deteriorate
as development occurs in other regions faster than in the Northeast. With
the project, farm incomes would increase substantially. At full development
in 1991, some 55% of farm families in the project area would exceed the
poverty income level.
Project Charges
6.13      To date, no water charges have been levied on irrigation schemes
operated by RID. An indirect tax is borne by farmers who produce a market-
able surplus of rice because of Thailand's system of rice export taxes. The
most important of these taxes is the rice premium which is a fee per ton paid
for an export license and depends on the grade of rice. The rice premium is
varied according to world market prices in order to stabilize the domestic
price for urban consumers and to ensure that windfall profits, when world
prices are high, accrue to the public sector rather than exporters or producers.
In recent years the average premium for all grades has ranged from a low of
B 600 (US$30) per ton in 1972 to a peak in early 1974 when it exceeded B 4,000
(US$200) per ton. Annual government receipts in the 1970s have ranged from
B 26 million (US$13 million) to B 3,300 million (US$165 million). The rice
premium has little impact on subsistence farmers who consume most of the
rice they produce, but it definitely depresses the incomes of farmers in
irrigated areas or those with large rainfed holdings who have a significant
surplus for sale.
6.14      Prior to 1973, the Bank accepted the rice premium as a form of
cost recovery for irrigation projects. Since then, however, in four projects
financed by Bank loans and credits, the Government has undertaken to conduct
studies to determine appropriate levels of project specific charges and
thereafter to impose and collect such charges. These projects place more
emphasis on on-farm development than previous Bank-financed projects and
lead to clearly identifiable improvements to the productivity of the land
holdings of the individual project beneficiaries. It was for this reason
that the Government has decided to introduce a more direct form of cost
recovery than provided by the rice premium.
6.15      In the Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement Project (Cr. 379-TH) which
is now nearing completion, the Government proposal which has been accepted
by the Bank is to impose a charge which would recover 90% of the cost of
on-farm development, excluding land-levelling, over nine years without
interest. The actual cost of on-farm works and the charge per hectare have
yet to be established. In Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement Project; Stage II
(Loan 1468-TH), where construction has recently begun, the Government has



- 33 -
agreed to recover 50% of the cost of on-farm development (including land
levelling) over not more than 15 years with interest not less than 12%, with
appropriate grace periods. In both projects, the Bank for Agriculture and
Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) has agreed to serve as the collection agent.
In the case of the Phitsanulcok Project (Loan 1139-TH) and the Northeast
Thailand Irrigation Improvement Project (Cr. 461-TH) the Government has
requested, and the Bank has a,greed, to an extension of time to carry out the
necessary studies to determine appropriate levels of charges. These studies
involve working with the farmers to prepare detailed farm budgets in areas
where irrigation has been established and cropping intensities and yields are
approaching full development. Because of delays in both projects, cropping
intensities close to full development have only recently been reached on
areas large enough to form a basis for the study. Because of differences in
the modes of on-farm developtment the results from the Chao Phya area are not
directly applicable to other projects.
6.16      The Government has also undertaken to strengthen its legislative
authority in regard to irrigation charges, since existing legislation is
inadequate.  Authority to collect 0 and M charges and recover on-farm develop-
ment costs is provided under two Acts: (1) the Land Consolidation Act which
empowers the Government to collect 90% of the cost of common irrigation works
and the full cost of on-farm development and of associated 0 and M works in
designated "land consolidation area," and (2) the Irrigation Act which
empowers Government to charge farmers a flat fee per hectare for land under
irrigation. The former Act applies to only a small portion of irrigated land
in the central plain, and the latter Act has never been applied because of
the unreliability of much of the system. New legislation which will enable
the Government to assess, impose and collect appropriate charges from benefi-
ciaries of all irrigation projects is now being drafted. For the proposed
project, assurances were obtained that the Government would:
(a)  not later than June 30, 1980 submit to the National Assembly
appropriate legislative measures which would enable the Borrower to
assess, impose and collect appropriate charges from beneficiaries
of all irrigation projects;
(b) on the basis of the cost recovery study for the Stage I project
(Credit 461-TH), prepare and submit to the Bank and IFAD for
review and comment, not later than December 31, 1980, proposals
for charges to be levied on project beneficiaries; and
(c) subject to (a) and (b) above, impose and collect charges, not later
than three years after the completion of tertiary systems in blocks
of about 3,000 ha, on terms and under procedures satisfactory to
the Bank and IFAD, sufficient to recover:
(i) the project's operation and maintenance costs and
(ii) a reasonable portion of the cost of the tertiary
systems.

6.17      As an illustration of the farmers' capacity to pay, an analysis has
been made assuming the farmers would pay;
(a) full O&M costs (B 250/ha in Lam Pao and the Upper 7one of Lam
Takhong, and B 150/ha in the Lower Zone of Lam Takhong); and
(b) annual charges sufficient to repay 50% of the estimated B 8,400/ha
on-farm development costs over 15 years, including a three-year
grace period, at 12% interest.
6.18      In determining the adequacy of the above level of project charges,
all project charges, costs and benefits are measured at present values dis-
counted at 15% over the 30-year life of the project, and in terms of January
1979 constant prices (Table 6.4)
6.19      In the cost recovery analysis, US$61.0 million construction costs
(base estimate of irrigation component plus physical contingencies) are
charged against the project. The present value of construction and O&M
costs, discounted at 15%, is US$40.0 million. At full project development
and during the period of maximum capital repayment, incremental project
charges total US$2.4 million per year. Since only O&M charges are assumed to
remain constant in real terms, while capital repayment charges are fixed in
nominal terms, with an annual inflation of 10%, the real net present value of
incremental project charges (in terms of January 1979 constant prices) would
be US$2.8 million, giving a cost recovery index of 7%. If the rice premium
were taken into account for all incremental production, the cost recovery
index would be 13%.
6.20      In the rent recovery analysis, indices are calculated for five
typical farms (para. 6.09). Again assuming 10% annual inflation, the rent
recovery indices vary from 9 to 16%. These rates indicate that the farmers
would have sufficient financial incentive to attain projected yields and
cropping intensities and are considered satisfactory in view of the low per
capita income over most of the project area and the Government's efforts to
increase agricultural productivity and to reduce the disparity in incomes
between the Northeast and other regions.

7. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
7.01      The proposed project would increase cropping intensities and yields
on about 51,300 ha through the improvement and extension of irrigation works.
Rice would be the main crop grown throughout the project area, but in the
dry-season irrigated upland crops, mainly peanuts and mung bean, would also
be grown. Approximately 21,000 farm families would benefit directly from the
increased production and consequent employment. The project would create a
demand for an additional 4.3 million man-days of farm labor per year. The
project would meet the Government's objectives of increased food and cash
crop production and more balanced regional distribution of development at a
capital cost of about US$2,900 per benefited farm family.
7.02      Benefits.  Expected future yields and production with and without
the project are discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 presents the farm-gate
prices for inputs and outputs, based on the Bank's commodity price forecasts
for rice, peanuts and chemical fertilizers, and domestic prices for other
commodities. Gross returns, production costs, net returns (without account-
ing for labor costs) and labor requirements per ha are given in Annex 2.
Figure 5.1 shows the proposed cropping calendar. Table 7.1 summarizes the
foregoing information and gives the expected benefits at full agricultural
development for the two components of the project and for the project as a
whole.
7.03      Foreign Exchange.  The common unit of account used in the economic
analysis is uncommitted public income measured at border prices. Because of
import taxes and quantitative restrictions, the official exchange rate
understates the value to the economy of foreign exchange used in carrying out
the project. For this reason specific conversion factors for a number of
broad categories of goods and services produced or consumed by the project
have been used to express all values in terms of the common unit of account.
Table 7.2 lists the standard and specific conversion factors used in con-
verting from domestic to border prices.
7.04      Farm Labor.  There are an estimated 21,000 farm families in the
project area with an average family size of 6.6 giving a total farm family
population of 139,000. In addition, there are about 500 landless families
(3,300 persons). With an average number of 2.25 full time workers on farms
in Lam Pao and 2.0 in Lam Takhong, plus about 1,000 landless laborers, the
total farm labor force available in the project area is about 46,000. On the
basis of 24 days per worker per month, the total labor supply is now about
1.1 million man-days per month and 13.2 million man-days per year. Assuming
population growth in the area at 2% per year, the labor supply at full
project development in year 13 would be 1.4 million man-days per month and
16.8 million man-days per year.
7.05      The demand for labor in the project area is at present largely
limited to the wet season, and for much of the year there is underemployment.
With the project, farm employment opportunities will increase from the present
4.2 to 8.5 million man-days. In peak months, July, August and November, local
labor shortages may develop, but there should be no problem in hiring the
necessary labor from surrounding areas. Tables 7.3 and 7.4 give estimates of
total monthly labor requirements in the project area.

/a  Weighted average of conversion factors for trade (0.47) and

and transport/handling costs account for 75% of his margin.
/b  Weighted average of conversion factors for industry (0.80) and
trade, assuming milling cost accounts for 75% and profit accounts
for 25% of the miller's margin.
7.06      Information on wages actually paid within the project area through-
out the year is limited. Market wage rates range from about B 10 to B 25 per
day. B 15 per man-day was adopted as being representative of the present
financial wage rate. Because of imperfections in the labor market however,
market wages do not fully reflect the varying demand and severe underemploy-
ment in the project area. Consequently, observed market wage rates are
likely to be higher than the economic cost of labor. Estimates of the
economic cost of labor have been made using the techniques developed in the
Phitsanulok Irrigation Project (Report 248b-TH). The results of the calcu-
lations for the two project areas are given in Annex 2, Table 7. For the
project as a whole, the future economic cost of farm labor would be B 73.5
million with the project at full development and B 39.3 million without the
project, or an incremental cost of B 34.2 million. This would be equivalent
to pricing the incremental employment of 4.3 million man-days per year at a
shadow rate of B 8 per man-day.
7.07      Project Costs.  The total investment cost, expressed in January
1979 economic prices, is US$48.3 million.  Investment costs were adjusted to
exclude taxes and transfer payments (cost of civil works reduced 10%) and all
local costs were multiplied by the conversion factor of 0.74 for construction
to express them in border prices. Costs include physical contingencies
but exclude price contingencies. Estimates of annual O&M costs for Lam Pao



- 39 -
and the Upper Zone of Lam Takhong are US$9/ha for the main system and
US$2.20/ha for the on-farm systems. The O&M cost for the Lam Takhong Lower
Zone is estimated at US$5.40/ha.
7.08      Development Period.  According to the project implementation
schedule, all works would be completed by mid 1984 in time for the 1984 wet
season crop. Beginning with the first crop grown under project conditions,
farmers would achieve the projected yield levels over seven years. The
project would reach full development in 1991.
7.09      Economic Rate of Return.  Using the foregoing assumptions and
discounting costs and benefits over a 30-year evaluation period, the economic
rate of return for the entire project is 25% (Table 7.5). Rates of return
for the individual project areas are 26% for Lam Pao and 20% for Lam Takhong.
Sensitivity of the rate of return for the entire project was tested to cost
overruns and reduction and delay of benefits. The effects of these changes
were as follows:
Alternative                   Economic Rate of Return
(a)  a 20% increase in construction cost                  22%
(b)  a 20% reduction in benefits                          21%
(c)  a two-year slippage of benefits                      19%
(d)  a combination of (a), (b), and (c)                   15%
7.10      Risks.  There are no unusual risks associated with the project.
The risks normally associated with irrigation projects have been accounted
for in the estimates of yields and in the areas to be irrigated during the
dry-season. Delays in procurement have been encountered in other irrigation
projects in Thailand, and these cannot be ruled out in the future. However,
progress on all Bank-financed irrigation projects has shown a marked improve-
ment in this area during the past year.
