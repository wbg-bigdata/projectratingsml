PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
1.        This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Mopti II Rice
Project in Mali, for which Credit 753-MLI in the amount of US$ 15.0 million
was approved on November 29, 1977.  The original cr3dit closing date was
November 30, 1983, the actual June 30, 1985.  The last disbursement was
made on July 30, 1985 after which US$ 64,000 remained undisbursed.  The
project was tht fifth creidt for agriculture and the second for rice
production in Mali. It was identified by the Regional Mission in Western
Africa (RMWA) and prepar .d by the Institut d'Economie Rurale (IER) of the
Ministry of Rural Development in Bamako. It was followed by the Mopti Area
Development Project (Credit 1597-MLI) which was approved on May 21, 1985.
2.        This PCR was prepared by the West Africa Region and is based in
part on a Proect Implementation (Rapport d'Execution) Report prepared by
the project  implementing agency Opgration Riz Mopti  (ORM)  supervision
reports, and the appraisal report (January 1983) for the Mopti Area
Development Project.  This PCR reviews elements that helped the development
of the Mopti Region.
3.        The PCR was not subjected to audit by OED, and the draft report
was sent to the Borrower for comment on March 23, 1987. No comments were
received.

MALI
MOPTI II RICE PROJECT
(Credit 753-MLI)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.       This was the second rice  production  project IDA financed in Mali.
It was preceded by four credits for agriculture) the first of which was for
rice production. The project was identified by the Bank's Regional Mission
in West Africa (RMWA) in 1974 and prepared by the Institut d'Economie Rurale
(IER) of the Ministry of Rural Development in Bamako. The appraisal fol-
lowed in November 1976 and the credit was approved in November 1977. The
project's objective was to affect at full development about 13,000 families
(90,000-100,000 people) in an area with an incremental paddy production of
about 34,000 tons in an area of low economic activity.
The project centered on (a)  construction of four polders (together
h,800 ha), (b) improvement of polders developed under the first rice project
(Credit 277-MLI), (c) deep ploughing of the newly developed polders and of
14,285 ha of polder, financed  by  Cr.  277-MLI, (d) construction of stores,
workshops, offices, houses, and training centers, (e) acquisition of vehi-
cles, machinery, equipment, and two ferries, (f) an applied research and a
credit program, and (g) technical assistance.
3.       The project was expected to begin  in  mid 1978 and to be completed
by November 1983. However, the closing date had to be extended to June 30,
1985.  Final  disbursement  was  made  in  July  1985.    Total project cost
increased slightly, from US$29.9 million (appraisal) to US$31.5 million,
mainly because of more expensive civil works which made up more than half of
total project costs.
4.       Project design was largely based  on the experience of the previous
rice production project (Cr. 277-MLI).    This previous project had produced
better than estimated results.    With  enough rainfall during three project
years of five, a higher rice price than estiuated at appraisal, and a larger
number of project beneficiaries than anticipated, its actual rate of return
exceeded estimates.   The  Mopti  II  project  was  to  (a) expand the areas
flooded, (b) improve ORM's managerial capability, (c) _pgrade the efficiency
of ORM's supporting services, and (d) introduce training.
5.       While its civil works  components  progressed remarkably well, the
project did not attain its production targets. Key problems--and therewith
inadequate flooding of polders--were the droughts and the non-adherence to
the recommended technical package (poor quality seed, inadequate equipment,
failure to weed, farmers' attitude).    An oversized and not always relevant
agricultural extension program caused results at farm level to stay below



-v 
expectations. At appraisal the risk of abnormally dry years was under-
estimated. Supervision missions did not pay sufficient attention to the
technical package and to the financial situation, but gave disproportionate
attention to civil works.
6.       Lessons learned are of weight  fov the follow-up project (Cr. 1597-
MLI) for which the following agreements have been reached.
(a)  Water components.  Controlled flooding is to be revised so that the
flood probability increases to 95%.   Polder rice cultivation would
therefore decrease from 36,200 ha to 27,000 ha leaving about 9t00O
ha to  rainfed  cultivation.    Control  of  water  levels  will be
improved by construction of additional dikes and canals;
(b) Agricultural Credit will be administered by BNDA with ORM assis-
tance. Loan transactions of farmers will be handled by BNDA only
thus clearly separating them from water charges;
(c) Farming practices and ORM's Extension Service. With more appropri-
ate credit conditions, farmers will be better equipped to follow
the recommended farming practices.    Farmers will buy threshers to
do their own threshing rather than having it done by ORM. ORM's
extension component can be reduced as the project's technical
aspects are fairly simple and because farmers have had continuous
tutoring for fifteen years.
(d) Marketing of paddy has been a loss for ORM, the only authorized
buyer of the paddy produced by the project. ORM, under the follow-
up project, will progressively liberalize paddy sales and have it
on the free market system by the fifth year.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MALI MOPTI II RICE PROJECT
-(Credit 753-NLI)
I. BACKGROUND
A.   General
1.01      The Mopti II Rice Project (Cr. 753-MLI) followed a first Mopti
Rice Project (Cr. 277-MLI) appraised in April 1971, and is followed by a
third project, the Mopti Area Development Project, approved on May 21,
1985, and effective since November 15, 1985. All three projects are based
on  the  same  concept:  the  cultivation  of  rice  within  polders  under
controlled flooding to reduce  the risks  inherent  to cultivation under
uncontrolled flood conditions,  as traditionally practiced in the flood
plains of the Niger river basin.  The Mopti II Rice Project was the sixth
IDA operation in the Malian agricultural sector.
1.02      This PCR is based on:  (a) a "Rapport d'Execution" prepared by
ORM, received in the Bank on April 4, 1985; (b) the series of supervision
reports issued throughout project implementation; and (c) the findings of
an appraisal mission (January 1983) for the Mopti Area Development project.
The three rice-based operations in the Mopti region, together with the
First Livestock Project (Cr. 538-MLI, of 1973), constitute in fact a series
of interrelated actions and reactions.   Thus, rather than reviewing the
performance of Mopti II as an independent project, the approach of this PCR
is to focus on the key elements which, throughout the evo,lution of the
physical, agricultural and social conditions, have helped the Borrower and
the Bank in making some progress toward the understanding of the complex
process of development of the Mopti region.
B.   First Mopti Rice Project (Cr. 277-MLI)
1.03      The first Mopti Rice Project was implemented from 1972 to 1978.
Main conponents were: (a) the construction of three new polders (about
13,000 ha) along the Niger and the Bani rivers; (b) the rehabilitation of
five existing polders (about 18,000 ha); (c) land preparation (deep
ploughing) on about 10,300 ha; (d) the construction of ancillary buildings
(offices, workshops, storage, etc.) and acquisition of vehicle and farming
equipment; (e) an applied research program, including a seed production
farm; and (f) the provision of technical assistance to the Operation Riz
Mopti (ORM), the project's executing agency.  About 7,300 families were
expected  to benefit from the project.   Project cost was estimated at
appraisal at US$9.4 million, of which foreign financing amounted to US$7.6
million: an IDA credit of US$6.9 million and a grant equivalent to US$0.7
million  from  France's  Fonds  d'Aide  et  de  Cooperation  (PAC).   A
supplementary IDA credit of US$2.6 million was approved in 1975 to offset
the effect of the dollar devaluation and to finance changes in project
design and cost overruns.  FAC also increased its contribution by US$0.5
million equivalent.
1.04      ORM prepared an Implementation Report, dated June 1978, on the
basis of which the Western Africa Regional Office prepared a PCR dated
December 1980. Further, on June 25, 1981, OED issued a Project Performance
Audit Memorandum (report No. 3523) which concluded that, despite of
shortcomings in certain areas, the controlled flood irrigation system



- 2 -
offers benefits to a large number of farmers at low cost and does not
require drastic changes of existing farming systems.
1.05      The two first years of the implementation period (1972-1978) were
very dry and, in terms of total output, the results were disappointing;
conversely, rainfall in years 1974-76 was acceptable and results were
encouraging.   The  table  below  summarizes  the  evolution  of  production
parameters expressed as percentage of appraisal estimates except for the
ratio "harvested area/sown area" which refers to actual annual values.

a/ per harvested area.
Yields per harvested area were good, exceeding consistently, after the
second year, appraisal estimates, which called for an increase from 0.9
t/ha to 1.5 t/ha in five years. Regarding harvested area it seems that,
aside from the two abnormally dry first years, there was a systematic
deviation from harvested to sown area of -20%, larger than the -10% assumed
at appraisal.  In all likelihood, that deviation was due to the fact that
actual rainfall in those years was below the rainfall accepted at appraisal
as "normal" rainfall, which was defined as the rainfall that would have a
90% probability of being equalled or exceeded.
1.06      Altogether, economic results were acceptable, mainly because a
dramatic increase in the economic price of rice (more than 300% above
appraisal estimate).  Thus, in spite of project output being lower than
expected, the actual rate of return was estimated to be 17%, higher than
the  14%  estimated  at  appraisal.   The number of project  beneficiaries
exceeded appraisal estimates, reaching about 9,000 families. However, some
unexpected and undesirable distortions were found regarding distribution of
project lands: about 25% of participants were not primarily farmers (civil
servants, traders, etc.) and 6% of participants were attributed 21% of the
area. Although not supported by a rigorous study, it became well known
that holdings under these two categories experienced severe shortages of
labor at harvesting, which probably had an adverse impact on the overall
output.  Therefore land reallocation became an important component under
the Mopti Area Development Project (Cr. 1597-MLI).



II. PROJECT FORMULATION
A. Identification and Preparation
2.01      The Mopti II Rice Project was identified by the Regional Mission
in Western Africa (RMWA) in November 1974 and prepared by the Institut
d'Economie Rurale (IER) of the Ministry of Rural Development in Bamako.
The project was conceived as a follow-up and extension of the then on-going
Mopti Rice Project.   Project preparation was financed with funds  from
Cr. 277-MLI.
B. Appraisal
2.02      The project was appraised in November 1976.  There is no record
of disagreement between Government and the Bank. Main issues identified by
the appraisal mission were:
(a)  Timing of project implementation.  It was then commonly accepted
that Mali had attained self-sufficiency in rice production and
that the project  might bring  about  a surplus.   The mission
recommended to go ahead with the project without delay, giving
more importance to the continuity element between the first and
second projects than to the potential marketing problems derived
from a production surplus.
(b)  Quality of Extension arnd Farmers' Response.  The mission found
that performance of ORM's extension service was deficient;
further, although new rice varieties had been well received,
farmers  had  not  adopted  new  farming  techniques   (mainly
line-sowing and weeding) but rather, they kept their traditional
practices. The mission recommended that those new practices were
made mandatory, that they should be carried out by ORM at a fee
(MF 1,000/ha) and farmers failing to apply "more efficient
methods should be divested of their land-use rights."
(c) Financial Equilibrium of ORM. The mission flagged the weakness
of ORM's financial position, given that the resources to finance
its operating costs were to be provided by the farmers, through
the payment of a "development levy", and by the Government,
through budgetary allocations. The appraisal mission recommended
that the financial situation of ORM be reviewed annually;
further, the mission envisaged that a substantial increase in the
"development levy" (from MF 180 kg/ha to MF 300 kg/ha of paddy)
might be necessary to ensure ORM's financial viability.
2.03      The Decision Meeting accepted the mission's recommendations on
the above  three  issues.   NO other issues were  subject  to discussion.
However, one other issue was addressed: the inclusion in the project of a
health compon.ent for the control of schistosomiasis.  Such a component was
not included in the project, because, it was concluded that a decision on
that issue should await the results of a specialized study carried out by



- 4 -
the Office de Coordination et de Cooperation pour la Lutte contre les
Grandes Endemies.  The meeting also agreed that, if further action on a
possible health component were warranted, the appropriate Division would
participate in a post-appraisal mission. This did not happen.
C. Negotiations, Board Presentation and Signing
2.04      Negotiations were held from October 3 to 6, 1977.  The project
remained essentially as proposed by the appraisal mission.  The only change
worth noting was the inclusion, at the request of the Malian delegation, of
a modest applied research program.   There were no conditions for Board
presentation.  Most significant assurances given by the Malian Government
were that: (a) farmers would have priority in land e.llocation over non-
farmers; (b) price of paddy would be increased to MF 50/kg (from MF 45/kg)
before the 1978/79 campaign; and (c) the development levy would be
gradually raised up to 240 kg/ha by 1982 (from 160 kg/ha).
2.05      The credit (No. 753-MLI) was approved by the Board on November
29, 1977. ED's comments focused on the measures taken to cope with the
most notorious difficulties arisen in the previous project, namely the
weakness of the extension services and the allocation of project lands to
non-farmers  (civil servants,  traders,  etc.).   The Credit Agreement was
signed on December 8, 1977.
D. Objectives and Description
2.06      Taking into consideration the lessons learned from the preceding
project, Mopti II objectives were to: (a) expand moderately the floodable
area; (b) improve ORM's managerial capability; (c) upgrade the efficiency
of supporting services rendered by ORM to farmers; and (d) widen the
project scope by introducing alphabetization and training components. At
full development, the project was expected to reach 13,000 families
(90,000-100,000 people).
2.07      The project consists of:
-    construction of four polders (Sarg-Mala, Ouronema, Tiroguel and
Torokoro) with a total area of 8,800 ha;
-    improvements to polders developed under Credit 277-MLI;
-    deep ploughing of the new polders as well as of 14,285 ha in
polders constructed under Credit 227-MLI or being improved with
financing provided by the African Development Fund (ADF);
-    construction of storage facilities for paddy, farm inputs and
farm equipment, of workshops, offices and staff houses, and
training centers;
-    acquisition of farm machinery, civil works maintenance equipment,
vehicles, two ferries, workshop and office equipment;



establishment of an adult literacy program for villages in the
project area and an audio-visual program to be used by extension
services;
-    an applied agricultural research program;
-    agricultural  credit  for  the purchase  of fertilizer and  farm
implements;
-    technical assistance for project management, and ORM staff and
operating costs during the project period to the extent that they
are attributable to the expansion of the project area;
-    provision of support to the Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of
Rural Development including an extension to existing offices,
acquisition of equipment, travel scholarships and funds for the
execution of studies for irrigation projects which may be
included in a future IDA-financed project.
The project was expected to begin in mid-1978 and to be completed in five
years.
2.08      Project costs were estimated at US$26.3 million, net of taxes, to
be financed as follows: IDA, US$15 million; FAC, US$2 million; ADF, US$6
million; users, US$2 million; and Government, US$1.3 million.
2.09      At full development, the project was expected to increase annual
paddy production by some 34,000 t (15,000 t from new polders and 19,000 t
from improved existing ones). The economic rate of return was estimated at
18%. Anticipated risks were those deriving from the variability inherent
to the central elements of the project concept: the timing and intensity of
early local rains determining the sowing period and, subsequently, the
timing and level reached by the Niger's flood. It was estimated that a 20%
drop in benefits would still yield an ERR cf 12%.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Effectiveness and start-up
3.01      The  only  condition  of  credit  effectiveness  (other  than  the
standard ones) was the fulfillment of all conditions precedent to the
initial disbursements of the FAC grant. The credit became effective on May
15, 1978, before the funds of the previous credit were fully used.  The
project had a timely start.  Contracts for earth moving, deep ploughing,
buildings and equipment (which had been prepared during execution of Mopti
I) were awarded promptly. Acquisition of vehicles was also made on time.
No  procurement  problems  are  reported.   Regarding  farming  equipment,
however, Bank required that purchases under Cr. 753-MLI were to be
postponed until the equipment procured under the preceding credit reached a
reasonable rate of utilization.



-6-
B. Project Development
3.02      Civil Works.  The project's physical targets were fully attained
in a timely manner.   Four new polders were built; works included dikes
(70 km), conveyance canals with regulating gates (25 km), and feeder roads
(210 km).  In addition, v polder initiated under Mopti I (Bougoula) was
completed under Mopti II and rehabilitation works (dikes, 150 km; roads, 35
km; and canals, 230 km) were carried out on nine existing poldere.  Deep
ploughing was carried out on an area of 20,400 ha, practically the entire
area foreseen at appraisal. Buildings for offices, warehouses and housing
for project staff were executed according to appraisal estimates. Annex 1
gives the quantities of works actually carried out under the project and
compares actual results with appraisal projections for the area to be
attributed to users and area requiring deep-ploughing.
3.03      Land Distribution.  At completion in 1983, an area of 30,700 ha
had been distributed to some 12,600 users; the area was about 20% short of
the 38,300 ha foreseen at appraisal, while the number of beneficiaries was
very close to the initial target of 13,000. Consequently, at 2.3 ha, the
average farm size was about 20% smaller than anticipated. The distribution
of the average farm size is fairly homogeneous throughout the project area,
ranging from 1.6 ha in Sofara to 3.2 ha in Soufouroulaye. Given the low
level of mechanization (para. 3.10 b) the average farm size was probably
excessive for the labor force of the average farm.
3.04      Agricultural Production.  The project has failed to attain its
production targets as shown below:
Cultivated Area
Estimate    Actual         Yield     Production     Actual/Est.

a/ actual harvested area/estimate
The project's poor agricultural performance contrasts sharply with the
remarkably  good  progress  of  its  hardware  components.   Thus,  for  the
campaign 1980/81, three years after effectiveness, the sixth supervision
report (August 17, 1981) shows that civil works, deep ploughing and
acquisition of equipment were completed, which pushed disbursements to 126%
of appraisal  estimates.   Conversely,  the harvested area was  less  than
one-half of appraisal projections, yield was off more than one-third and
thus, actual production was only 31% of the appraisal projections.   The
reasons of this poor agricultural performance are analyzed in paragraph
3.10.



- 7 -
3.05      The  Applied  research  program,  financed  by  FAC,  was  delayed
because of disbursement prob'lems. Yet three results were attained:
'a) development of a relay cropping system for the polders consisting
of maize/sorghum (grown and harvested during the rainfed season)
intersown with rice (sown after the first rains and harvested
after the recession of floods);
(b) response to Tilemsi phosphates on the mostly phosphorus-deficient
soils of the ORM polders; and
(c) identification of two improved rice varieties.
3.06      The adult literacy program was 100% FAC financed, and despite
disbursement problems (see para 3.05), started satisfactorily because it
was temporarily run on ORM funds. More than 100 villages were motivated.
The program continues under the Mopti Area Development Project (Cr.
1597-MLI).
3.07      Organization  and  Management.   During  the  execution  of  the
project, ORM was directly responsible for the actual carrying out of most
of the project activities, with the farmers having a limited participation
in the making of farming plans and decisions. To discharge its duties, ORM
structure comprises five "divisions", each divided into two-to-four
"sections", as indicated beiow:
Division                              Sections
Production           Training, Extension, Applied Research, Literacy program
Services             Marketing, Farming equipment, Workshop
Studies              Statistics, Monitoring and Evaluation
Administration       Accounting, Personnel, Secretary
Engineering          Studies, Works
ORM is staffed with civil servants and personnel hired under fixed-term
contracts.   In the last three years of the project the number of civil
servants was stable at 137, of which 54 were at professional level;
fixed-term personnel, most of them supporting staff, decreased from 389 in
1982 to 367 in 1983 and further down to 347 in 1984.
C. Cost and Financing
3.08      Appraisal Estimates.  At appraisal, project cost net of taxes and
duties was estimated at US$26.3 million, equivalent to MF12.9 billion at
the then prevailing rate of US$1=MF490.  Project cost and financing plan
are summarized below 1/:

3.07       Actual Results.  Actual project cost has been estimated by ORM at
MR 12,636 million   2/, i.e.,  practically  the exact  amount projected  at
appraisal. According to ORM the financing of the project was as follows:
Source                                 Amount
(HF Million)               (%)

It seems, however, that ORM has not accounted for in its closing statement
the amount of MF 490 million equivalent earmarked for support of the
2/   Rapport d'Ex&cution, pages 29 and 37.

Directorate of Rural Engineering (Genie Rural) of the Ministry of
Agriculture. Aside from this omission, there are some inconsistencies and
information gaps in the "Rapport d'Execution" which prevent a detailed
comparison between projected and actual costs. Thus, while actual cost by
source of finance is MF 12,636 million (page 29), as indicated above, the
analytical breakdown gives a total of MF 12,208 million (page 30).
Further, the categories used in the "Rapport d'Exgcution" do not coincide
with those used at appraisal neither in estimating project costs or in
establishing   disbursement   categories.    And   finally,   there   are
inconsistencies in the "Rapport d'Execution" on the amount shown for civil
works, which in Table 1 (page 12) is MF 7535 million (derived from actual
cost  of  civil  work  contracts)  while  in  Section 4.2  (page 30)  is
MF 7,950 million. With the above qualifications, actual project cost, by
category, have been estimated by ORM as follows:
Amount
(MF million)             (%)
Civil works                                7950              65.1
Agricultural research                       110                0.9
Farming equipment                           744                6.1
Management and extension                   3404               27.9
12,208             100.0
3.08      From the above, it follows that the civil works component of the
project was well defined and actual cost (MF 7,950 million) was just 6%
above appraisal estimates (MF 7,492 million, including contingencies). As
for other components, project implementation diverged substaatially from
appraisal projections and, once again, with due consideration to adverse
climatic conditions, it looks like neither the Borrower nor the Bank had a
firm grasp of the project.
D. Key Problems
3.09      The Droughts Throughout  the Implementation Period.   The most
significant cause of the project's poor results is, undoubtedly, the
exceptionally low floods of the Niger and Bani rivers which, in 1982, 83
and 84, have been well below the levels which, based on the period 1940 to
1983 (44 years), are expected to be equalled or exceeded nine out of ten
years. Currently, we are witnessing how the isohyets which determine the
Sahelian (100 mm-400 mm) and Sudanian (400 mm-1,200 mm) zones have been
displaced southward between 200 km and 400 km, if the data of the last
20 years (1965-1984) are used for the frequential analysis of the rainfall.
Although  nothing  can  be  stated  conclusively,   the  possibility  of
deterioration of the rainfall patterns in the Sahelian zone is a widespread
concern among scientists.   Further,  if the period  1965-84 is used to
analyze the frequential distribution of the rainfall, the flood area
associated with the 90%- probability rainfall is substantially smaller than
the flood area associated with the rainfall of the same frequency, but
based on the data of the 1940-83 period. Reciprocally, the probability of



- 10 -
flooding a given area is lower if calculated on the 1965-84 data than if
calculated on data of the 1940-83 period. The problem, however, is that we
do not and can not know which sample is more representative of the next 5,
10, 20,..., years.
3.10      Faming Problems.   Aside  from the devastating effects of the
drought, the project's agricultural aspects seem to have deteriorated. At
appraisal, four stages of agricultural performance were foreseen; they
were:
Stage     Key Features                                    Yield (t/ha)
1       Traditional rarieties; controlled flooding           1.1
2       Higher-yielding varieties; improved
land preparation                                    1.4
3       Stage 2 plus line-sowing, weeding                    1.9
4       Stage 3 plus fertilizers                             2.5
Based on the above and considering an acceptable rate of progress of
farming techniques, average yield by year 4 was expected to be 1,8 t/ha and
at  full  development  (year  7)  2 t/ha.   Actual results have been most
disappointing; in 1982-83, the project's fourth year, average yield over a
harvested area of 2,520 ha was 730 kg/ha, with about 50% of the area
stagnating at 600 kg/ha.
Immediate causes of this poor performance seem to be:
(a)  Poor quality seeds.  Under the supervision of the West Africa
Rice Development Association (WARDA) the project has identified
two improved rice varieties; however, no provisions were made to
secure production of quality seed at farmers' level; thus,
farmers have been using low quality seed infested with low
yielding wild rice species.   Furthermore,  due to the lack of
adequate farming practices, wild rice has often re-invaded paddy
fields which had been previously freed from it by the deep
ploughing operation.
(b)  Lack or inadequacy of farming equipment.  Farmers were generally
under-equipped and, therefore, farming practices have been
inadequate. The main reason is probably the inappropriateness of
the agricultural credit scheme which consisted of 0RM procuring
directly the farming equipment and passing it on to the farmers
with a down-payment of 40-45% and the balance due in one or two
years, at 3% or 5% interest rate. These harsh conditions caused
the demand for credit to stagnate (and recovery rate was low),
with the result that about 60% of farmers lacked oxen or
animal-drawn   implements.    In  addition,   ORM   acquired   132
line-seeders which never worked properly and the farmers,
logically, were not interested in buying that equipment, with the
consequence that the line-sowing practice was never carried out.
Another similar case was the acquisition of 32 threshers (make:
Colombini), which were inadapted to the conditions of the project

and, despite the modifications introduced by the manufacturer, of
very limited use.  A lot of 22 mid-size tractors (make: Fiat),
with implements, was also procured under the project, mainly to
carry out  the deep- ploughing  operation.   The  tractors have
performed well, but once the deep-ploughing was completed, they
remained  under-utilized  since  only  a  few  absentee  farmers
required the services of ORM equipzent to carry out farming
operations in their fields, while farmers are reluctant to pay
for ORM services that they can carry out or from which they do
not anticipate a clear benefit.   A detailed list of farming
equipment is at the "Rapport d'Execution" (Table 3, page 17).
(c)  Failure to weed.  This operation requires a considerable labor
input.  In the absence of good seeds, adequate land preparation
and efficient sowing, farmers are not interested in weeding.
(d)  Lukewarm farmers' attitude toward improved farming techniques.
When measured against the demand for land, farmers' attitude
toward the project is very positive, with almost 13,000 farmers
participating in the project and 30,000 ha distributed. However,
farmers' response toward accepting improved farming techniques is
mixed, as anticipated by the appraisal mission in view of the
results of Mopti I.  Farmers have largely accepted the use of
"sativa" varieties seeds, although the quality was below
standards; end-of-season ploughing has been practiced to the
extent of availability of oxen and implements, i.e. on about 30%
of the area; and line-sowing and weeding have been neglected as
discussed  in  (b)  and  (c)  above.   While  sound  statistical
information has not been gathered, it seems that farmers have
split their interest between the in-polder rice cultivation under
the supervision of ORM and the off-polder private farming, where
with less effort and without any financial charges, they may
obtain similar yields in grain crops depending upon rainfall and,
further, they grow some vegetables for self-consumption and/or
cash income.
3.11      Financial Problems.   The combined effect of higher operating
costs and lower operating revenues than anticipated at appraisal resulted
in an annual operating deficit for ORM of MP 270 million  (average for
1977-78 t1iugh 1981-82), while appraisal projections called for an annual
operating surplus of MF 225 million  (average for the same period).   A
summarized comparison between projected and actual annual results (for the
above period) is presented below:
Projected      Actual          Deviation
-----(MF million)----              %
Operating revenue                700             300             -  57
Operating costs                  475             570             +  20
Surplus (Deficit)                225            (270)            - 220

The operating deficit has been financed through Government subsidies,
deferred maintenance and IDA financing, which was to cover 50% of the
incremeaital operating cost.
E.   Borrower's Performance
3.12      With  due  consideration  to  all  adverse  climatic  conditions,
Borrower's  performance  is open  to question.   Weakest  areas  have  been
agricultural extension and organization-and-management.
(a)  Agricultural Extension.   ORM has made  a remarkable effort in
establishing a most detailed extension program which includes:
(i) the training of the extension agents, (ii) the setting up of
village producers' committees with detailed description of their
functions, and (iii) the carrying out of specific extension
activities. An added function has been the collection of charges
due by farmers to ORM, which has taken up to 40% of the agents'
activities. While the program seems to have been carried out in
strict accordance with the guidelines regarding seminars,
meetings,    visits,    setting-up    of    farmers'    committees,
demonstration practices, etc., results at farm level have been
well below expectations.   It seems that the dense and costly
program of activities was largely oversized given the limitations
imposed by other factors: first, the climate; and second, the
relative modesty of the technical innovations.
(b) Organization and Management. The administrative structure of ORM
and the number of staff throughout the project were essentially
in accordance with appraisal projections (para 3.05); the issue,
however is not the numbers per ce, but the central concept of the
project, as established at appraisal, concerning the role and
responsibilities of ORM. As recommended in the SAR of the Mopti
Area Development Project, the transfer of threshing and marketing
operations to farmers, and credit operations to the Agricultural
Development Bank (BNDA) will reduce the administrative burden
substantially, permitting a reduction in staff numbers.
F.   Bank's performance
3.13      Bank's performance went hand-in-hand with Borrower's.  The risk
of occurrence of abnormally dry years was underestimated at appraisal,
since  the  worst  case  analyzed  was  a  20%  decrease  in  benefits.   In
retrospect, given the uncertainties inherent to the controlled flooding
method, it seems prudent to allow for a more adverse situation than those
accepted as "worst case" at appraisal.  In fact, as the recent climatic
circumstances have brutally demonstrated, a 90% probability of reaching or
exceeding a certain flood level, derived from the analysis of the historic
records, does not preclude the occurrence of discrete events, no matter how
low the probability, such as two, three or more consecutive years of
practically nil floods.



- 13 -
3.14      Aside from the adverse climatic conditions, the Bank failed to
react to several problems which arose from what, in retrospect, seem to be
design flaws:   inadequate agronomic package  (3.07)  and over-optimistic
financial projections  (3.08).  Judging by the specialties of the staff
assigned to supervision, the Bank did not follow-up closely enough the most
sensitive areas (agriculture and financing) during project execution,
particularly the first half of the implementation period, as shown in the
table below:
1st half       2nd  half          Total

Total                         100             100            100
3.15      The above data indicate that the Bank allowed a disproportionate
weight to the project's civil works component, which entailed little or no
risk given  its  relative  simplicity.   Conversely,  it seems that major
decisions  related  to  agriculture  (e.g.  the  acquisition  of  farming
equipment, para 3.07 b) were approved by the Bank without proper technical
analysis.  Further, despite the warnings of the appraisal mission about the
weakness of the ORM's financial position (2.02 c), no measures were taken
during supervision to correct the financial deterioration of the project
executing agency. However, as stated at the outset (1.02) the Borrower and
the Bank have agreed to undertake the necessary corrective measures to
overcome the difficulties encountered in the past. These measures, which
are outlined in Chapter V, will be implemented through the follow-up Mopti
Area Development Project.
IV. ECONOMIc ANALYSIS
4.01      At appraisal, the project's economic rate of return was estimated
at 18%.  This calculation was based on the assumption that incremental
production from the project would be absorbed by domestic demand including
demand for the build-up of a rice reserve stock as a protective measure
against future droughts. If part of incremental production were to be



- 14 -
exported, for a transitional period of some 5 years, the rate of return
would still be 16%. In calculating the ERR, the following adjustments were
made:
-    the assistance to the Rural Works Department was excluded;
-    the adult literacy program was excluded;
-    the applied agricultural research program was excluded;
-    only 50% of technical assistance was counted as incremental cost
since, without the project, two technicians would have still been
required;
-    the farm-gate economic price of paddy was based on the import
substitution price;
-    the project life was considered at 25 years.
A sensitivity analysis was performed to measure the variations of the ERR
to deviations from basic hypotheses. Results are summarized below:
Assumptions               ERR (%)
Base estimate               18
Costs + 20%                 13
Benefits - 20%              12
2-year delay                13
4.02      In evaluating the project from today's perspective, a distinction
must be made between the polders built under Mopti I (the existing polders)
and the new polders built under Mopti II.  For the existing polders, the
extremely  adverse  climatic  conditions  have  determined  that  actual
production "with project" has been below the pre-project production.
Therefore, the calculation of a rate of return for investments related to
existing polders would not be meaningful. We have thus limited the ex-post
economic analysis to the investments made in the four new polders, where an
increment of production, albeit modest, has been obtained with respect to
the pre-project situation.
4.03      In calculating the ex-post economic rate of return, the following
criteria have been considered:
(a) investments in infrastructure are actual costs of the
contracts related to the new polders;
(b) investments in equipment have been pro-rated to the ratio of
area of new polders to total area; cost of equipment



- 15 -
actually acquired but practically never used (seeding
machines and threshers) has been excluded;
(c)  incremental production has been measured as the difference
between actual production obtained in the new polders until
the season 1984/85 and the produetion resulting from
applying the of f-polder actual yield to the area of new
polders; for the future, "'with" and "without" yields have
been estimated at the levels assumed in the Mopti Area
Development Staff Appraisal Report;
(d)  operating costs for the entire Operation Riz Mopti have been
analyzed  in  detail  during  appraisal  of  the Mopti Area
Development project; the estimates for Mopti II have been
defined by applying again the new area-to-total area ratio
to the values obtained or projected during appraisal of the
follow-up project;
(e) replacement of equipment is expected to take place every
five years;
(f)  the economic price of paddy has been estimated at MP 150,000
per ton, which is the resulting import parity farm gate
price based on Mopti reference market (riz Abidjan), as
presented in the Mopti Area Development project Staff
Appraisal Report;
(g) a standard conversion factor of 0.95 has been used to adjust
local costs;
(h) GDP deflators used to adjust historic costs to 1983 prices
have been as follows:
Year      _
1979      70.3
1980      76.7
1981      85.2
1982      92.7
(i) the project's economic life has been estimated in 25 years.
Supporting detailed calculations are at Annex 2.
4.04      With the above assumptions, the project's ERR is estimated to be
about 3%. The main reason to explain the difference between the return
estimated at appraisal and that calculated now seems to be the drastic
drought during the project's early years, which has an extended negative
effect over the project's life.

V. CONCLUSIONS: LESSONS LEARNED
5.09      To improve project performance,  it is clear that satisfactory
answers must be found to the four essential project issues:
(a) Water minagement.
(b) Agricultural credit.
(c)  Farming practices and ORM's Extension Service.
(d) Marketing.
In the course of processing the Mopti Area Development Project, Government
and IDA have reached consensus on actions to be taken to address the above
issues. A brief summary of the agreements reached is presented below.
(a) Water management. Aside from the uncertainties inherent to
the climatic factors, there is a wide consensus among
project  staff,   consultants  and  Bank  staff  that  the
operational guidelines for controlled flooding should be
revised to reduce the risk of losses that will occur in the
areas  not  reached  by  the  flood.   This  revision  would
essentially  consist  of limiting cultivation to the area
which would have a 95% probability 3/ of having its water
requirements  satisfied  by  the  flood.   The  operational
criteria adopted in the Mopti Area Development project would
reduce the in-polder rice area from 36,200 ha to 27,000 ha,
by abandoning the higher fringes where flooding is more
uncertain.  As a consequence,  the overall probability of
fully meeting  the project's water re,uirements would be
91.5%, while with the operational criteria of the past the
probability was 84.6%.  Further, control of water levels
will be substantially improved by the construction of
additional dikes, which will subdivide certain large polders
into two or even three "sub-polders", and by the upgrading
of certain secondary canals.
(b)  Agricultural credit.   In the future,  agricultural  credit
will be administered by the National Bank for Agricultural
Development (BNDA), assisted by ORM staff in the appraisr.l
of loan requests. Further, the financial responsibility of
the farmers will be directly with BNDA, instead of ORM, thus
separating out water charges from loan repayment. Terms and
conditions will be as follows:
3/   This is a general criterion;  in certain polders, however,  due to
topographic constraints, lower probabilities are accepted, thus
increasing the risk of not meeting in full their water requirements.



- 17 -
Loan Type                 Terms           Down payment
(years)              (%)
Farming equipment           4                  10
Threshers                   4                  20
Blacksmith's equipment      5                  20
Storage wells              10                  10
Livestock                   5                  20
Interest rates would be consistent with those agreed with Government for
the Mali Sud II project, namely 10% for individuals and 9% to producer
groups where these absorb significant risks and administrative costs.
(c)  Faming  practices  and  ORM's  Extension  Service.   It  is
expected that, as a consequence of the more appropriate
credit conditions, farmers will be better equipped and thus
more able to carry out adequately the recommended farming
practices.   Another  essential  innovation  will  be  the
threshing, which will be done at the villages by the farmers
themselves, with threshers acquired directly through credit,
ir,stead  of  being  done  by  ORM.   Moreover,  given  the
transferring of most of the farming activities to the
farmers, it seems appropriate to call the attention of
future supervision missions on the intensity of the
intervention of ORM extension service into the farmers'
business.   As  stated  earlier  (para. 3.06  d),  there  are
questions about the adequacy of the size of the extension
component, especially taking into consideration that the
technical aspects of the project are fairly simple and that,
after 15 years of continued tutoring, farmers' requirements
can probably be satisfied with a much lighter ORM presence.
(d)  Marketing.   ORM has been the only authorized buyer of paddy
produced in the project, acting on behalf of the Bureau of
Agricultural Products  of Mali  (OPAM).   However,  since  a
large proportion of the production was self-consumed, this
policy has not been appreciably detrimental to the farmers.
It has been, however, detrimental to ORM, which had to be
staffed and equipped to carry out all the operations related
to the threshing-milling-marketing process.  Further, since
the price paid by OPAM to ORM was far below its
administrative costs, the process has b.en one of the
sources of losses for ORM.  In the follow-up project, ORM
will progressively reduce its role in this operation, so as
to cease its participation by the fifth year.  Farmers are
now free to sell to whomever they wish.
