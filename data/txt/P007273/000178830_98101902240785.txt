INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF HAITI
FOR A FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Haiti for the equivalent of US$2000
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for the rehabili-
tation of the Northern Road.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report on Haiti, Report No. 410-HA
entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Haiti" was issued on
April 18, 1974. Updated social and economic data are presented in Annex I1
3.        Haiti is one of the poorest nations in the world, and the only
country in the Western Hemisphere included in the U.N. list of 25 least
developed nations. GNP per capita in 1972 stood at about US$130. An
infant mortality rate of about 200 per thousand live births, an average
life expectancy of 45 years, low nutrition and sanitation standards (mal-
nutrition and gastro-enteric diseases account for over half the deaths in
the country) and an adult literacy rate of only 20 percent characterize
the depressed living standards of the population.
4.        The country's natural resources are limited. Of the country's
total area, only about 15 percent is well suited to agriculture although
twice as much is actually under cultivation. The remaining 70 percent is
too arid and steep for cultivation. The average density of population is
nearly 500 per square kilometer of arable land, one of the highest in the
world. In addition, much of the country suffers from frequent hurricanes,
floods and droughts. Known mineral resources are also modest, consisting
of bauxite, copper and lignite. Haiti's natural conditions for tourism,
in contrast, are more favorable. Some beaches offer good potential for
development, the mountainous terrain is attractive and Haitits culture
and art are distinctive.
5.        Economic growth and social progress have been hampered by periods
of political instability which did not permit the development of an adequate
technical and physical infrastructure. Inadequate maintenance has reduced
the efficiency of the limited irrigation network. The lack of transport
infrastructure has hampered the development of commercial agriculture
while deficient communications between the capital and the interior have
led to the concentration of economic activity in Port-au-Prince.
Power generation capacity is also well below the Latin American average



- 2 -
despite recent investments in hydro-electrical generation facilities.
6.       Nevertheless, in marked contrast to the previous decade when
the economy stagnated, Haiti enjoyed some growth in 1968-73. Expansion
of small-scale manufacturing and assembly operations, tourism and cons-
truction led to average annual increases of GDP of about 4 percent uwhi,e
population grew at an estimated annual rate of 1.7 percent. These acti-
vities contributed noticeably to ixrnproving economic conditions in Port-au-
Prince.  Emfployment in assembly operations, for example, increased from
10,000 in 1971 to 25,000 in 1973.   Agriculture, however, which employs hO
percent of Haiti's population and accounts for nearly half of GDP and about
60 percent of merchandise exports has as yet shown little dynamism. Progress
in agriculture will require the adoption of improved production techniqtles
and provision of greater incentives to farmers, as well as the improvement
of transport facilities.
7.       Value added in agriculture stagnated in 1974. The Government
adopted two important measures in 1974 to stimulate agricultural produlction
(a program to modernize coffee production and a substantial increase in
the price paid to farmers for sugar cane). Adverse economic conditions
in the United States brought about declines in investment and growth in
tourism and export-oriented manufacturing. Consequently, GDP growth in
1974 is estimated to have been only 1.9 percent.
8.       The Government's strategy is to create the conditions for a fuller
utilization of the country's physical and human resources by first con-
structing or rebuilding the necessary infrastructure in transport, power,
irrigation, water supply and telecommunications; second, taking measures
to increase agricultural productivity and third, extending educational
services to reach greater numbers of persons. This strategy will require
much higher public development outlays than in the past. The five-year
development plan 1977/81 that the authorities are currently preparing
is expected to call for an increase of development expenditures from about
US$15 million per year in 1970-72 (3 percent of GDP) to about US$50
million per year in 1977-81 (about 5 percent of GDP).
9.       The successful execution of such a program presupposes a substan-
tial increase in +tle flow of external assistance. In the period 1970-72
gross disbursements on external official loans financed 25 percent of de-
velopment experditure.  Technical assistance grants and private donations
financed the equivalent of 35 percent. The remaining 40 percent was fi-
nanced out of public savings. On the basis of disbursements of already
committed loans and of likely annual commitment levels of US$30-US$35 million,
it is expected that official lending agencies will finance about 54 percent Otf
development expenditures in the period 1977-81. Capital investment grants
from bilateral agencies are expected to finance about 10 percent of develop-
ment expenditures. Technical assistance grants and private donations are
expected to continue financing an important, albeit dec4ining, share of



development expenditures (about 14 percent) Public savings are expected
to finance the remaining 22 percent.
100     Although public savings are expected to finance a smaller share
of development expenditures in 1977-81 than in 1970-72, in absolute terms
the level of public savings is expected to increase from about US$9
million per year in 1970-72 to about US$12 million per year in 1977-81l
These savings will be utilized to provide counterpart funds for externally
financed projects, to finance some investment projects that are not linked
to foreign loans and to repay outstanding public debt. In addition to the
need for increased external assistance and public savings, the Government's
development plan will require the allocation of increased domestic resources
for operating expenditures associated with the new development projects in
agriculture, education, road maintenance and other sectors.
11.     The Government has expressed its determination to make the
necessary fiscal effort. It has recently adopted two tax measures which,
although they may have the immediate effect of lowering some collections,
should stimulate commodity exports and in the medium term generate higher
revenues. In August 1973, the specific tax on coffee, which contributed
to reducing producer incentives by absorbing a large share of export
proceeds when international prices were low, was replaced by a progressive
ad valorem levy. In early 1975, the export tax on sugar was lowered from
its previous rate which was as high as 80 percent at the margin. In
addition, the Government plans to improve income tax administration to
nearly triple collections by the end of the decade. Customs administra-
tion and the collection of import duties are also being tightened, with
technical assistance from the OAS and the IMF.
12.     Additional development funds are expected to originate from the
taxation of bauxite exports of which the Government has allocated
US$4.4 million for development expenditures in 1975. It is expected
that at least similar amounts will be made available in future years.
On balance all the measures contemplated are likely to increase the
ratio of taxes to GNP from its current level of 12 percent to about 14
percent by 1980.
13.     Even with the adoption of the increased tax measures discussed
above (paras. 11 and 12), government revenues allocated to development
may not be sufficient to finance the investment program and operating
expenditures. It may, therefore, be necessary to channel increased
resources into the development effort by allocating to it certain revenues
that at present do not fall within the budgetary process, in particular
part of the profits of public enterprises such as the Port Administration,
the State Flour Mill and the Tobacco Monopoly.



4 -
14.      Haiti's balance of payments has deteriorated in 1974.  The
current-account deficit doubled to US$41 million as merchandise imports
increased from US$70 million to US$110 million, largely owing to higher
import prices. (Higher costs of fuels accounted for one-fourth of the
US$4o million increase in 1974 imports.) On the other hand, higher
prices benefitted Haiti's exports, particularly coffee, sugar, essential
oils and sisal, but these gains were partially offset by declines in
the volume of coffee and sugar exports. Haiti's international reserves
decreased by about US$20 million in 197h. As of December 31, 19743
net international reserves of the National Bank were equivalent to
US$1009 million, less than one month's imports; for the consolidated
banking system, net international reserves were negative, of the order
of US$3.1 million. The 1974 balance of payments deficiL was partially
financed by the drawdown of US$7.6 million on the IMF stand-by and
special oil facility. An IMF mission visited Port-au-Prince in May to
discuss with the authorities the possible extension of the current stand-
by arrangement which will expire in July.
15.      Haiti's resource gap is expected to continue to widen in the
medium term, reflecting the import requirements associated with the
Government's investment program. As there has been relatively little
net foreign borrowing in the last decade, the debt-service ratio is
relatively low (5,8 percent in 1974). But even with a low debt-service
ratio, the balance of payments is likely to constitute a constraint to
economic development in view of the limited growth prospects of Haiti's
major exports (coffee and bauxite) and because export diversification
through the development of other agricultural products, manufacturing
and tourism, is still at an early stage. In view of the country's
poverty, vulnerable balance of payments and the need to employ most of
its limited import capacity to sustain growth, Haiti will require
external assistance on highly concessionary terms for a long time if
it is to achieve a significant improvement in the standard of living of
its population.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
16.      Bank Group lending to Haiti prior to 1974 consisted of a
US$2.6 million Bank loan (141-HA) in 1956 for highway rehabilitation and
maintenance and a US$350,000 IDA credit (32-HA) in 1962 for highway
maintenance. Much of the progress achieved under these projects was
lost in the 1960's, a period during which Haiti's highway system deterio-
rated badly for lack of adequate maintenance.
17.      In 1974, responding to the Government's assignment of the highest
priority to the reconstruction of the countryts major roads, IDA made a
US$10 million credit (478-HA) to commence reconstruction of the Northern Road
which connects the capital, Port-au-Prince, to Cap Haitien, Haiti's second
city. The project (Third Highway Project), as approved by the Executive
Directors in May 197h, included the replacement of the collapsed Estere Bridge,
reconstruction of about 150 km of the 250 km Northern Road, comprising those



sections in most urgent need of reconstruction and technical assistance to
undertake studies, train personnel in the Ministry of Public Works, Trans-
portation and Communications (TPTC) and assist the domnestic civil works
industry in management, administration and engineering. Because of much
higher than expected bids reflecting worldwide inflation and probably the
unfamiliarity of international contractors with conditlons in Haiti, the
Executive Directors authorized on October 29, 1974 a reduction in the scope
of the road reconstruction work to about 80 km. Similar bid overruns also
affected other major road projects in Haiti. Annex IT contains a stumary
statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of April 30, 1975, and a state-
ment of the execution of the ongoing Third Highway Project.
18.       Other official lending agencies are also supporting the Government's
road rehabilitation program. The IDB has made a loan for the reconstruction
of the Southern Road from Port-au-Prince towards Les Cayes and the French
Government is financing construction of a road connecting the Southern Roar
to Jacmel. USAID is financing technical assistance equipment and shop ins-
tallations for a road maintenance program. The UNDP is financing the tech-
nical assistance component of the Third Highway Project (with the Bank as
executing agency) including a study of Haiti'- transport sector which is
expected to recommend future investment priorities. All agencies participa-
ting in the roads program meet twice a year in Port-au-Prince with the
Government to coordinate their efforts.
19.       In addition to its lending for road reconstruction, the IDB has
made loans in Haiti for agricultural and industrial credit, rural education
and improvement of Port-au-Prince's water supply and port facilities. IDB
is also providing assistance to the Government for the preparation of inte-
grated rural development projects in the Cul-de-Sac Plain and in the
Artibonite Valley. USAID has provided assistance for a malaria eradica-
tion program, for community development and for agriculture with emphasis
on rehabilitation of coffee production and improvement of feeder roads.
Besides the recently approved Jacmel road project, France has given assis-
tance to technical and secondary education and to improve airport facilities
in several provincial towns. The Federal Republic of Germany is assisting
rural development schemes, with current emphasis on drilling of wells for
irrigation in the Gonaive Plain. Canada is financing a technical education
project, a study of the water resources of Haiti for both irrigation and
power potential, and the preparation of a rural development program in the
southern peninsula. An important contribution to Haiti's development are
the programs of the many voluntary agencies whose assistance, especially
in health, education and agriculture, will continue to be a vital element
in community development.

20.        Future IDA assistance for the Government's road rehabilitation
program would take into account the recommendations of the study of the
transport sector for which the Bank is executing agency. It is likely
that road projects (e.g. the Central Road, linking Port-au-Prince
to Cap Haitien via the Central Plateau, and rural feeder roads) will rank
high among investment priorities.
21.        The recent rapid development of light assembly industries in
the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area contributed positively to the balance
of payments and in particular to the amelioration of Haiti's acute under-
employment problem. This industrial development has increased the demand
for power in the metropolitan area to a point where shortages are expected
by 1977 unless urgent measures are taken to reinforce the capital's mainly
hydro-electric power supply. The Bank is presently assisting the
Government in preparing a small-scale thermal power project for Port-au-
Prince. The consultants who are carrying out the feasibility study will
also make recommendations on the improvement of the distribution system
and on the strengthening of the State Power Company's accounting and
management. The Bank also expects to assist the Government in carrying
out a country-wide sector study which would make recommendations, inter
alia on future high priority power investments, The results of an on-
going hydraulic resources study which is being financed by Canada (CIDA)
would be integrated into the sector study. IDA lending for power, other
than for the Port-au-Prince thermal project, would take into account the
findings of the study.
22.        An 1DB/UNESCO mission visited Haiti in June 1974 to identify
the country's educational needs. The Association is presently discussing
with the Government and with iDB possible areas in which the two lending
agencies could provide assistance in education.
23.        Following an IDB/IBRD/FAO agriculture sector study in
September 1973, which identified several high priority project possibi-
lities in the agricultural sector, the Government and Bank/FAO staff
began preparation of an integrated rural development project in the
Northern part of Haiti (Plaine du Nord)0 This densely populated region
has considerable agricultural potential which could be developed through
a combination of public investment (feeder roads, drainage and irrigation)
and strengthening of existing peasant organizations.
240        The Government has requested IDA assistance for a program to
improve thewater supply system of provincial towns, Inadequate water
supply contributes to Haiti's serious health problem including one of
thl highest infant mortality rates in the Western Hemisphere. Further-
more, Haiti's considerable but largely unrealized tourism potential can
only be developed if improvements in water supply and other services
in the country's provincial towns are made.
25.        The Bank Group's share in Haiti's publicly-guaranteed external
debt outstanding and disbursed amounted to about two percent at the end
of 1974. The Bank Group's share of external public debt service during
1974 was about 0.2 percent. Its share of outstanding publicly-guaranteed
external debt could rise to about 35 percent by the end of the 1970's;



- 7 -
its share of external public debt service would be of the order of 10 percent.
26.        There have been no IFC operations in Haiti and none are under
active consideration at this time.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
27.        Haiti's transport network is still rudimentary. Mountainous
terrain hampers communications between rural communities and the main
distribution centers. Except for a short narrow-gauge railroad
used for hauling cane to a sugar mill, all inland transportation is by
road. The port of Port-au-Prince handles over 90 percent of the country's
export and import trade although numerous small hairbors along the countryt s
long coast line are used for coastal shipping, and a few other general
cargo and specialized ports service international shipping. Port-au-Prince
airport handles all international air traffic and over 90 percent of all
tourist travel. A few provincial towns have small airports for domestic
air traffic.
Transport Planning
28.        TPTC is responsible for implementing transportation projects, but
has not been actively involved in transportation planning for lack of expe-
rienced professional staff and transportation data. In order to strengthen
transportation planning, the Third Highway Project includes technical assis-
tarce for creation of a planning uni4 under TPTC, and for the preparation of a
National Transport Study which will provide the sectoral input for tie next
national development plan (1977-81).  Consultants preparing the study will
also train counterpart personnel in planning procedures.
29.        The National Transport Study, to be completed in mid-1976, will
identify priority transport projects. Assurances were obtained during nego-
tiations for the proposed credit that the Government will consult with the
Association on the recommendations of the Study with a view to formulating
an investment plan for the transport sector, and that, until such a plan has
been completed, the Government will consult with the Association prior to
undertaking any major investment in the transport sector (Section 4.06 of
the draft Credit Agreement).
Maritime Transport
30.        With 1500 km of coastline, Haiti has long used coastal shipping
as a means of moving merchandise and people. The Government, with the assis-
tance of IDB, is making major improvements to the Port-au-Prince harbor. The
other main general cargo harbor is at Cap Haitien. There is a specialized
harbor at Miragoane for handling bauxite, Coastal shipping will continue to
serve an important role for isolated communities, but cannot provide an
economic alternative to an improved road network.



Air Transportation
31.       Though a few Caribbean cruise ships stop at Port-au-Prince and
Cap Haitien with passengers coming ashore for a few hours, almost all
international passengers arrive and leave by air. Haiti's international
airport at Port-au-Prince can handle international flights adequately.
Several provincial towns have small airports but domestic air traffic
is low due to the small size of the country and the poverty of the popu-
lation. Some tourist traffic flies from Port-au-Prince to Cap Haitien
and to Jacmel on the north and south coasts, respectively.
Roads
32.       The basic road network of Haiti was built during the 1920's
and from the mid-1940's to the mid-1950's. Of the 3000 km constructed
during those periods, only 350 km were paved. From the mid-1950's
through the 1960ts no new road construction was undertaken and existing
roads deteriorated to such an extent that communities which formerly had
year-round communication with the main trading centers, now find themselves
isolated during the rainy seasons. Trucking costs became so high that
costs of evacuation of agricultural products left little revenue for the
producer.
33.       In the late 1960's the Government began to recognize the need
to redress this situation and requested OAS and UNDP assistance for
transportation studies. These studies identified the priority of the
reconstruction of the Northern and Southern Roads and underscored the
need for systematic road maintenance. As a result, USAID made a US$3.1
million loan and a US$0.6 million grant in 1973 to support a newly created
maintenance unit (SEPRRN) with technical assistance and equipment. The
IDB made a US$22.2 million loan in 1974 for the partial reconstruction of
the Southern Road and IDA lent US$10 million in 1974 to begin reconstruct-
ion of the Northern Road (Third Highway Project). The French Government
made a FF 35 million loan (about US$.3 million) in 1975 to build a road
connecting the Southern Road to the south coast city of Jacmel.
34.       The Government has taken several measures to improve road
maintenance. SEPRRN is being strengthened under an AID-sponsored program
designed to improve SEPRRIN's administration, modernize its equipment and
train field maintenance personnel. The Government has organized special
brigades to maintain sections of the Northern Road not being rebuilt under
the Third Highway Project. With the help of technical assistance being
supplied under the on-going project, regular traffic counts and origin-
destination surveys will be undertaken not later than December 31, 1975
and load limit legislation will be drafted for enactment before the end
of 1976. During negotiations for the proposed credit, an understanding
was reached with the Government on the basic outline of SEPRRN's five-
year maintenance and training plan and on the required budgetary alloca-
tions. A detailed five-year plan, based on the above outline, and in-
cluding specific measures for maintenance of the Northern Road, is being
prepared by the Government. Agreement on this detailed plan between the
Government and the Association is a condition of credit effectiveness
(Sections 4002 and 5.01 of the draft Credit Agreement).



35.       Counterpart funds for road construction and maintenance come from
earmarked excise taxes on fuel, from export taxes on bauxite and from the
general budget. Counterpart funds wil be needed over the next three years
for the Southern Road (IDB), for road maintenance and feeder roads (USAID),
as well as for the Northern Road. Revenue projections indicate that suffi-
cient funds would be available as counterpart for the proposed project and
assurances were received during negotiations that additional funds would
be provided by the Government if required (Section 3.01 of the draft Credit
Agreement).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
36.       The feasibility and detailed engineering studies for the project,
financed by UNDP, were carried out in 1973 by a French consultant firm
(Ingeroute) as part of the preparation of the Third Highway Project. These
studies have since been updated by a Canadian consultant firm (Ewart, Lea
and Tremblay) which was retained by the Government in October, 1974 to
evaluate pavement standards and also to design the Sonde bridge. The project
was appraised in the field in December 1974. Negotiations for the proposed
credit were held in Washington from April 7 to 11, 1975. The Haitian
delegation was headed by Mr. Emmanuel Bros, Minister of Finance. A Report
entitled "Haiti - Appraisal of a Fourth Highway Project" (No. 673a-HA) dated
May 21, 1975, is being distributed separately. The main features of the
credit and project are summarized in Annex III.
37.       The 250 km Northern Road is the most important highway in Haiti.
Near Port-au-Prince it serves a sugar factory, the country's only steel
processing mill, a cement factory and a flour mill. Seventy kilometers
north of the capital, the road skirts beach resort areas before crossing
the Artibonite Valley and the Gonaive Plain, both important agricultural
areas with potential for major increases in production. Beyond Gonaive
the road crosses two difficult mountain ranges before descending into the
fertile Northern Plain and to Cap Haitien, Haiti's second city. On a
mountain overlooking the Northern Plain, 30 km from Cap Haitien, is a
fortress, the Citadel, and at the foot of the mountain are the ruins of
Sans Souci Palace, both important historic sites which are expected to
increasingly attract tourists as the Northern Road is rebuilt.
Project Objective and Description
38.       The main objective of the project is completion of reconstruction
of the Northern Road. The project would consist of:
(a) reconstruction of the remaining 170 km not included in the
ongoing Third Highway Project;
(b) construction of a new bridge over the Artibonite River (Sonde
Bridge);



- 10 -
(c)  supervision of construction under (a) and (b);
(d)  evaluation of pavement standards, and design of Sonde Bridge;
(e)  technical assistance for (1) preparing specific priority
transport projects and (2) further improving the capability
of the domestic civil works industry.
39.       The pavement standards recommended in the 1973 engineering studies
have been reviewed by consultants (Ewart, Lea and Tremblay/Canada) to take in-
to account recent behavior of the pavements and current traffic volume,
as well as to update cost estimates. The existing Sonde Bridge on the
Artibonite River is nearly a hundred years old and, though still in re-
markably good condition, its replacement should not be too long delayed.
Should the bridge collapse a very long and costly detour (about 180 km)
would have to be used to evacuate agricultural products from the Artibonite
Valley, the Gonaive Plain and the Northern Plain.
140.      With the help of technical assistance financed under the ongoing
Third Highway Project, a transport sector planning unit will be set up under
TPTC by December 31, 1975. Under the proposed project, assistance would be
given to prepare transport projects of the highest priority recommended by
the ongoing Transport Sector Study, and selected by the Government in agree-
ment with the Association. The ongoing project is also supplying technical
assistance to strengthen the Haitian civil works industry with emphasis on
evaluating physical execution capacity and on training industry personnel
in administration, engineering and management (costing, budgeting, prepa-
ration of bids). Under the proposed project, assistance to domestic con-
tractors would continue the training begun under the ongoing project with
emphasis on practical on-the-job training. Local firms, some of which are
already participating in construction of the Northern Road as sub-contractors,
would be assisted to upgrade their expertise in job management and equip-
ment use and maintenance to enhance their capabilities to execute civil works
contractsO
Project Cost and Financing
41.       Based on the 1973 detailed engineering, on the recent review of
pavement standards and on bidding experience on the ongoing Third Highway
Project, the cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$26.3 million
equivalent net of duties and taxes (foreign contractors are exempted from
taxation). The foreign exchange component of US$20 million would be financed
by the proposed credit. Cost estimates for road reconstruction are based on
bids received under the Third Highway Project and on bids already received for
major civil works components of the proposed project. Cost estimates for
construction of the Sonde Bridge are based on prices for construction of the
recently completed Estere Bridge.  The cost estimat. of consultant services
for supervision and technical assistance has been based on experience under



the ongoing project. Allowances of 10 percent of civil works base line
costs for physical contingencies and 24 percent of project base line costs
for price contingencies have been included in project cost estimates. The
price contingencies reflect the results of the bidding mentioned in para-
graph 43 below and are considered adequate in the light of expected price
trends. A summary of project costs is found in Annex III.
Project Execution
42.       TPTC would be responsible for execution of the project and would
be assisted in supervision of construction by the sane consultant (Ingeroutet
France) who is supervising the ongoing project. Major earthworks, rock ex-
cavation and paving will require the use of mechanized methods. Other items,
particularly small structures and drainage works, will be executed by labor-
intensive methods.
43.       Procurement:  Although a 7-1/2 percent margin of preference is
available for local contractors, none are expected to qualify as prime
contractors. As indicated above (para. 40), continuing on-the-job training
should enable then to participate in bidding for prime contracts in the
future. Works on the ten road sections to be rebuilt and on construction
of the Sonde Bridge were divided into four lots. Bids for two of the lots,
equal to about 85 percent of the estimated cost of -ivil works, were
received in March 1975 on the basis of international competitive bidding
according to Bank Group guidelines. These bids were in line with project
cost estimates. Awards would only be made after approval of the credit
by the Executive Directors. Bids for the remaining two lots of civil works
will be called for as soon as bidding documents are completed.
44.       Disbursements of the credit would be for the foreign exchange
component of the project, estimated at 75 percent of total project cost, on
the basis of:
(a) For civil works: 100 percent of foreign exchange costs of
contractors, and 20 percent of local costs of contractors,
representing the estimated foreign exchange corponent;
(b)  For consultant. services:  100 percent of the foreign exchange
cost.
Up to $100,000 retroactive financing fror, the proposed credit is recormended
for consulting services undertaken after October 1, 1974 for the review of
pavement standards and for the design of the Sonde Bridge.
Economic Benefits
45.       The unreconstructed sections of the road would continue to deterior-
ate even if maintenance efforts were increased. Quantifiable benefits fron
the proposed road reconstruction would consist of reduced road maintenance costs
and of savings in vehicle operating costs. Since the transport industry is
competitive, a large part of savings in vehicle operating costs are likely to



- 12 -
be passed on to farmers, passengers and consumers. These savings, by
increasing revenues received by farmers from marketing of their crops,
should generate agricultural development, particularly in the Gonaive Plain
and the Artibonite Valley. They should also generate development of tourism
by providing an all weather road from Port-au-Prince to the tourist attrac-
tions near Cap Haitien. Non-quantifiable but nevertheless important benefits
would include the better integration of the northern part of the country with
the capital.
46.       Quantifiable benefits and costs were discounted over the period
1975 through 1997 (representing the construction period and the anticipated
20-year economic life of the project). Benefits are sensitive, of course, to
the assumptions made regarding the number of years that the existing Sonde
Bridge can still be used. The economic rate of return of the civil works
overall and assuming collapse of the existing Sonde Bridge in 1997, would
be about 26 percent. Assumptions of earlier collapse of the bridge increase
the estimated rate of return, up to 35 percent if failure of the bridge is
assumed as early as 1982. Sensitivity tests, assuning either (a) an increase
of construction costs by 25 percent, (b) a decrease in benefits by 25 percent
or (c) a reduction to zero for the amount of generated traffic, indicate
that the overall economic rate of return would still be no less than 21 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
47.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Hailti
and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section l(d), of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft
resolution approving the proposed credit are being distribuited to the Executive
Directors separately.
48.       Features of the draft Credit Agreement of special interest are
referred to in paragraphs 29, 34 and 35 of this Report. Agreenent between the
Government and the Association on a detailed five-year maintenance and training
plan is a special condition of credit effectiveness.
49.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - REC%MDTENDATION
50.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
