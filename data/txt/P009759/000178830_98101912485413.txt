Staff Appraisal Report
I. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Introduction
1.01      India has a population of 640 M which is growing at an annual rate
of 2%. Per capita income reached approximately US$150 per annum in 1977 and
is increasing at about 1.1% p.a. Some 70% of the population is engaged in
agriculture, which accounts for about 45% of GNP and provides the base of 60%
of India's exports. Although the average per capita income has increased and
access to public services has improved, in general, there has been little
change in the incomes of the vast masses of urban and rural poor; conserva-
tively measured, they total some 300 M people with incomes below the poverty
line of US$75 per capita per year (1977).
1.02      Against this background, the principal objectives of India's Five
Year Plan (1978/79-1982/83) are: (i) the removal--over a 10 year period--of
unemployment and significant underemployment; (ii) an appreciable rise in the
standard of living for the poorest segments of the population, which would be
achieved largely through the creation of productive employment; and (iii) pro-
vision by the Government of some of the basic needs of the people in the low
income groups. Agricultural growth and the expansion of irrigation facilities
are the cornerstones in the development strategy of the Draft Plan:
"The employment objective depends crucially on increased labor
absorption in agriculture and allied activities. This means
increasing the productivity of available land through irriga-
tion, multiple cropping and improved technology. The main thrust
of the planning strategy, therefore, would be to expand the area
under irrigation as rapidly as possible, and to develop cropping
patterns and agricultural practices which optimize the use of
land and water resources." 1/
These priorities are also reflected in Gujarat's 1979-80 Development Program:
"Agriculture has to be given the top-most priority. In a pre-
dominantly rural economy the key to alleviating poverty is to
accelerate the growth of agricultural incomes ....  Extending
the benefits of irrigation to additional areas and optimising
utilisation will play an important role in promoting agricul-
tural development ....  A substantial stepping up of the utili-
sation of the irrigation potential created already, has to be
obtained." 2/

Although during the Fifth Plan (1974-79), Gujarat achieved a relatively high
proportion (90%) of its targeted irrigation potertial compared with the ave-
rage for India, there has been a serious lag in utilization which, combined
with unexpectedly low yields, has resulted in significantly reduced benefits.
Thus, the aim of the proposed project is to help meet the national and State
objectives of expanding the area under irrigation and of addressing the major
causes of the under-utilization of irrigation investments in Gujarat:  inade-
quate planning, design and management. Gujarat's agricultural and irrigation
development, and the nature and causes of this "underutilization" are discussed
in Volume II (Sector Report) and summarized below.
Agricultural Development in Gujarat
1.03      Gujarat: covers an area of about 19.6 M ha and has a population of
about 32.0 M (1979).  It is relatively urbanized and has a large modern manu-
facturing sector, but agriculture, which in a normal year contributes 30-40%
of State income and employs about 65% of the labor force, has a predominant
influence on the State's economiy. Due to low and uncertain rainfall and
limited irrigation facilities, Gujarat is extremely susceptible to droughts
and famines. Although yields are therefore relatively low for most major
crops, the combination of advanced farming practizes and the cultivation of
high value crops has resulted in a productivity p(r agricultural worker which
is the fourth highest in India. Gujarat also has one of the best developed
systems for agricultural supporting services in India.
1.04      Between 1952/53 and 1964/65, agricultural production in Gujarat
grew faster than in any other State, as a result of the rapid expansion of
the cultivated area, a general yield increase and a shift towards high value
cash crops. Two factors changed the agricultural scene in the mid-1960s:
(i) the potential for an expansion of the net cull:ivated area had largely been
exhausted; and (ii) high yielding varieties for a number of foodgrains were
introduced on a large scale. Much of the transformation that was associated
with the "green revolution" took place between 1965/66 and 1971/72.
1.05      Mainly as a result of favorable weather, agricultural production
reached a peak in 1970/71 and 1971/72, which it barely recaptured in 1978/79 1/,
and although this apparent stagnation of recent years can be explained largely
by a combination of unfavorable exogenous factors,, it appears that the easy
benefits of the "green revolution" have already been reaped for the major
crops. In order to regain the momentum, the Government of Gujarat's (GOG)
present plans emphasize irrigation, soil conservat:ion programs aimed at improv-
ing soil moisture retention in rainfed areas, strengthening of agricultural
extension and research with special focus on drought and pest resisitant
varieties.
1/   1978/79 is the last year for which production data is available.  Because
of erratic rainfall during the 1979 monsoon season, it appears likely that
the level of agricultural production will be lower in 1979/80 than in
1978/79.

Irrigation Development in Gujarat
1.06      According to official statistics, about 18% of the cropped area
(1.76 M ha) is presently irrigated. This figure is less than two-thirds of
the national average, and only two States (Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra)
have a lower percentage of its cropped area irrigated. Gujarat's water re-
sources are heavily concentrated in the southern and central parts of the
mainland: the State's three major rivers flow through this area, which has
relatively high rainfall. The northern mainland, Saurashtra and Kutch, with
high to exceptionally high irrigation needs have limited surface and ground-
water resources.
1.07      Statewide, the potential for the development of surface water
resources is limited by a number of factors: (i) the river flows are highly
seasonal; (ii) where the flows are less seasonal, the topography is generally
flat and most damsites costly to develop; and (iii) agreements with the upper
riparian States limit Gujarat's use of river flows. With the exception of
Narmada, most of the river flows are either being utilized at present or
construction is underway to develop the remaining potential. Similarly, with
the exception of Southern Gujarat, half or more of the potential for well
irrigation in rainfed areas has been developed. Thus, any significant expan-
sion of the irrigated areas can come only from: (i) construction of the
Narmada Project; (ii) conjunctive use of surface and groundwater in command
areas; (iii) expansion of well irrigation in the rainfed areas in the South;
and (iv) iniprovements in the efficiency of existing and new projects.
1.08      A number of surface irrigation projects were started in the 1950s,
but implementation was slow, and not until the early 1960s, did the develop-
ment of surface irrigation accelerate. Nevertheless, on all three major
projects started in the 1950's (Mahi, Kakrapar and Shetrunji), although the
progress of storage diversion construction was relatively rapid, canal con-
struction lagged far behind. While the State's major irrigation works are
concentrated on the Gujarat mainland (only Shetrunji is located in Saurashtra
and no major project is located in Kutch), there are about 65 completed medium
irrigation projects (MIPs) 1/ located in all parts of the State. Minor surface
schemes (mainly tanks) provide only supplementary irrigation during the kharif
season, and the area irrigated varies substantially from year to year.
1.09      During the 1950s, the well irrigated area increased at an annual
rate of about 3.5%, mainly due to the sinking of new wells. In the 1960s, the
pace of development almost doubled and traditional lift methods were rapidly
replaced by pumps driven by diesel engines. In several areas, the limit of
groundwater resources is now being approached and the overall pace of develop-
ment is slowing down. Along the southern coast of Saurashtra, this problem
is compounded by salt water intrusion into the aquifer.

Past Performance of Major and Medium Irrigation Projects
1.10      Since Independence, the average cost for major and medium irrigation
projects in Gujarat has been about 30% higher than the national average. The
higher cost can, to a large extent, be explained by a shortage of good dam-
sites. However, the actual utilization of the irrigation potential is signif-
icantly lower in Gujarat, resulting in a cost per irrigated ha that is almost
twice the national average. In an attempt to remedy this situation, command
area development (CAD) programs--focusing primarily on development below the
Government outlet, i.e., on the construction of field channels, drains and land
shaping--have been initiated in most major irrigation projects. However, the
experience from projects where CAD programs have been operating indicates that
a lack of on-farm development is only a partial explanation for the low yields
and the underutilization of irrigation potential. 1/ It has become increasingly
clear that one of the major constraints to higher yields and the greater
utilization of irrigation water lies in the deficiencies of the system that
occur between the dam and the Government outlet. In particular, these defi-
ciencies are:
(a)  The hydrological data base is typically poor which results
in over-or-under-design of the dam and the irrigation net-
work in relation to the water de facto available.
(b)  Some of the projects are run-of-the-river schemes supplied
from a diversion weir. Large variations of the river flows
make the water supply unreliable and irrigation is usually
limited to khairf.
(c)  Water losses in the conveyance system and on fields are
grossly underestimated at the design stage resulting in
the area actually irrigated being considerably smaller
than the area commanded by the distribution system.
(d)  The water conveyance systems, especially in medium projects,
are incomplete at the farm level. Water is presently supplied
through outlets serving 40 ha blocks, ar.d the farmers are
expected to construct water courses and field channels within
the blocks. However, with few exceptiors, there are no
effective organizations to help the farmers with the design,
implemenitation and financing of these works. Consequently,
the fieLd channels that exist have not teen constructed to
exacting standards, resulting in both excessive water losses
and unreliable supply to the individual farms.
(e)  Inadequate water allocation procedures.  For the highest
yields, the farmers should plant many irrigated kharif crops
in June, but the approval of their water applications comes
only afl:er the reservoir has started to fill up in mid-July.
1/   See for example, "Gujarat Irrigation II Project; Volume II - Sector
Report" IBRD Report No. 2843a-IN, dated April 9, 1980; and "Maharashtra
Irrigation II Project; Volume II - Sectoral Background," IBRD Report No.
2529a-IN, dated September 13, 1979.



-5-
This usually results in too late a planting date--for both
the kharif and the following rabi crop--especially if the
application is rejected and the crop has to be grown under
rainfed conditions. Being "risk minimizers", the farmers
plant with the first monsoon rains in the later part of June
and go for a "low technology package" under the assumption
that they might not get any irrigation water. Only in the
case of drought during the later stages of the crop will
they apply for water. Thus, in normal years, the potential
for kharif irrigation remains largely unutilized.
(f)  The farmers have limited experience in irrigated crop man-
agement which leads to a wasteful use of water on the field.
(g)  There is no professional cadre of trained and experienced
water management specialists who can operate the system in
full response to agricultural requirements, or who can properly
advise farmers on land development and irrigation practices.
Consequently, the "underutilization" of irrigation potential is partly un-
avoidable because there is little possibility for projects designed and con-
structed to present standards to provide enough water to irrigate the
originally designated area.
1.11      In conclusion, project design, water allocation and canal operation
procedures have changed little since the nineteenth century when the prime ob-
jective of irrigation was to provide "insurance" against droughts and famines.
These design and management deficiencies make it impossible to operate the
projects so as to ensure timely and reliable water deliveries at the farmgate
which is a prerequisite for a productive and high value agriculture. Because
the water supply is unreliable, there is little incentive for the farmers to
carry out on-farm development (OFD), with the result that OFD programs have
had only a limited impact on the performance of agriculture in the command
areas. Improvements of irrigation infrastructure, water allocation procedures,
system operation practices, and on-farm works are thus complementary.
Evolution of IDA's Lending in Gujarat
1.12      The Bank Group's association with Gujarat in the irrigation sector
has been longer than with any other State in India. The Bank's first loan
or credit for irrigation development in India financed the construction of
Shetrunji's canal system (Cr. No. 13-IN, 1961, US$4.5 M).  Like other Indian
irrigation projects financed by the Bank Group at about the same time, the
Shetrunji project failed to achieve its agricultural potential due to an
inadequate irrigation infrastructure, weak agricultural supporting services
and over-optimistic planning assumptions.
1.13      These problems led to the development of a new emphasis in the
Bank's irrigation lending. The Kadana Irrigation Project (Cr. No. 176-IN,
1970, US$35 M) was the first of a second generation of projects in India,
which emphasized command area development: the project included a somewhat
improved canal system, construction of field channels, drains and landshaping



- 6 -
(and financing of these works through institutional credit), the construction
of market roads and an agricultural support program. As the project has only
recently been completed--having been delayed by two serious floods and cons-
truction problems--there is little data on the performance of the CAD pro-
gram. In 1978 the Government of India (GOI) requested IDA assistance to
finance a major part of Gujarat's irrigation development program: the result-
ing line-of-credit, the Gujaral: Irrigation Project (Cr. No. 808-IN, US$85 M)
included construction of about twenty new, and the modernization of about ten
existing medium irrigation projects (MIPs) located 1/ in most parts of the
State. Through the proposed Gujarat Irrigation II Project, IDA would extend
its involvement in Gujarat's irrigation sector: together with the on-going
credit for medium irrigation schemes, it would then be involved at all levels
of the State's irrigation program, 2/ for the first time in India. The bene-
fits of this close involvement are reflected in tae agreements on criteria
for improved planning, design, construction and operation (see Annex 1) that
have been reached between GOG and IDA during project preparation and appraisal.
Project Formulation
1.14      Given that expanding of the irrigated area is one of the cornerstones
of Gujarat's agricultural development strategy, and that the scope for ground-
water development is limited, GOG gives high priority to surface irrigation;
in the 1979/80 Annual Plan, 25% of the budget was allocated to irrigation. In
per capita terms, the investment rate is almost twice the national average.
Annual capital expenditures, in constant 1978/79 terms, rose from Rs 160 M
during the First Five Year Plan (1951-56) to Rs 431 M during the Fourth Plan
(1969-74) and reached Rs 818 M in 1978/79.
1.15      The plans for the next five year period emphasize:
(a)  The completion of all on-going major and medium projects
in order to minimize the gestation period and get a more
rapid buildup of irrigation benefits;
(b)  Construction of new medium projects, especially in
drought prone and backward areas;
(c)  Start on the Narmada scheme; and
(d)  Modernization of existing projects, primarily through
the provision of additional control structures, canal
lining, drainage works and construction of watercourses/
field channels.
1/   Although GOI and GOG defines "medium irrigation projects" as projects
with a CCA between 2,000 ha and 10,000 ha, the IDA Credit also included
some projects with a CCA between 10,000 ha anc 30,000 ha.
2/   Minor surface irrigation projects implemented by the District Panchayats
(Councils) would be excluded.



- 7 -
Two years have passed of the present five year plan (1978-82) and the original
plan has not been officially updated. However, taking into account recent
developments, it appears that the irrigation investments for the 1978/79-
1982/83 period will amount to about US$750 M, in constant 1978/79 terms, with
the following approximate breakdown:
Investments
1978/79-1982/83
-----US$ M-----
Narmada                                                  240
New projects with a CCA over 30,000 ha                   200
New projects with a CCA between
2,000 ha and 30,000 ha                                 200
Modernization of existing projects                        70
Others                                                    40
Total                                                  750
1.16      Within the constraints imposed by the State's limited surface water
resources, this represents a well formulated investment program. It balan-
ces short gestation, high yielding investments in medium irrigation projects,
completion of major projects and modernization of existing medium and major
projects with the need for a continuous long-term expansion of the irrigated
area through the start of the Narmada Project. By the later part of the
1980s, when it is likely that the first areas will be irrigated from the
Narmada Project, virtually all surface water resources outside the Narmada
basin will have been fully developed. In the formulation of the program, a
high weight has also been given to the needs of drought-prone and backward
areas. The proposed project, which reflects the priorities in both the
national and State Five Year and Annual Plans, would combine the completion
of three new major schemes in the backward areas; first-phase modernization
of Gujarat's largest project; coastal area development; operational and
management improvements; a training institute for land development and water
management; funds for preparation of Narmada Basin Projects in Gujarat and
Madhya Pradesh and of selected irrigation projects in other States.
1.17      The objectives of this credit would be to achieve an economic
use of scarce surface water resources and to ensure a reliable and equitable
supply to individual farmers. In order to meet these objectives, the credit
would address the major causes of under-utilization of irrigation investments
in Gujarat: inadequate planning, design and management of the systems (see
Volume II-Sector Report). Under the MIP line-of-credit (Credit 808-IN),
criteria for the planning, design, construction and operation of medium
irrigation projects were agreed with GOG. These and additional criteria would
be adopted for all the components. An agreement has been reached with GOG
that it would implement the project works in accordance with the full set of
planning criteria, design and construction standards and the operational
procedures listed in Appendix 1 and summarized below:
(a) The new irrigation projects would be planned and designed
to such standards that the water would be supplied to each
farm in the command area in a reliable and timely fashion
with a minimum of losses in conveyance between the dam



- 8 -
and the plant. Typically, this would involve: (i) the
Government would construct the channels down to each indi-
vidual farm; (ii) a 'major part of the distribution system
would be lined; (iii) a larger number of control structures
and measuring devices would be provided along the system;
and (iv) the number of farmers that have to cooperate in
distributing the water to the farmgates would be reduced;
(b) Technically feasible and economically viable programs
for modernization of existing projects would be started
in order to raise current distribution and water use
efficiencies to more acceptable levels; the systems would
then be able to meet the exacting requrements of high
yielding, high value crops;
(c) A special Command Area Development Wing would be esta-
blished in the Agricultural Department. It would be
staffed with properly trained land development and water
management specialists; the CAD Wing would be responsible
for both the operation of the irrigation systems and the
development of agriculture in the command areas;
(d)  Water allocation and operational procedures that would
help promote equity and efficiency inside the command
areas would be introduced; this would imply that each farmer
would get an allocation of water based on the size of his
holding and that the deliveries to each farm would be in
accordance with a predetermined rotational schedule; and
(e) More comprehensive technical, agricultural and socio-
economic investigations would be carried out as the basis
for project planning, and the resources--in terms of both
money and manpower--made available for preparation of
feasibility studies would be increased.
II. THE PROJECT AREAS
A. General
2.01      The three main project components would be located in distinctly
different areas of the State (Map 14606): the new major irrigation schemes
(Damanganga, Heran and Karjan) are located in the more backward southeastern
parts of the mainland; the modernization component: (Ukai-Kakrapar Project) is
located on the fertile coastal plain of South Gujarat where farms are small and
a large percentage of the population is landless; and the coastal development
component (consisting of smaller surface schemes) would be located along the
Saurashtra coast where a very productive area irrigated from wells is threatened
by intrusion of saline groundwater from the sea. The individual scheme areas
are shown on Maps 14608-14612 and their salient features are presented in Table
T-1. The areas are described in detail in Volume III and summarized below.



-9-
B. The New Scheme Areas
General
2.02      The Damanganga, Heran and Karjan scheme areas are generally char-
acterized by small farms and the population is predominantly tribal.  About
one-third of the families are landless. Economically, these areas are among
the poorest and most backward in Gujarat. It is estimated that almost three-
quarters of the population have per capita incomes below the poverty line
(US$75). The Damanganga River originates in the State of Maharashtra and dis-
charges into the Arabian Sea in the southernmost part of Gujarat. The dam is
located near the Maharashtra border and the project area extends to the coast.
About 73% of the catchment is located in Maharashtra. The project would
irrigate some 44,400 ha in the Valsad District of Gujarat, about 8,300 ha in
the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and some 3,400 ha in Daman which
is a part of the State of Goa, Daman and Diu. The total Culturable Command Area
(CCA) is 56,100 ha. The Heran River originates in the State of Madhya Pradesh.
It flows in a westerly direction to its confluence with the Orsang River, which
is a right bank tributary of the Narmada River. About 49% of the catchment
is located in Madhya Pradesh.  The scheme area, with a CCA of 32,100 ha, is
located in the Vadodara District. The Karjan River, which originates in the
eastern hills of Gujarat, is a left bank tributary of the Narmada River. The
scheme area, with a CCA of 56,200 ha, is located in the Bharuch District.
2.03      The total population of the three new scheme areas is about 450,000,
over half of which is tribal; in the Damanganga area, 75% of the population is
tribal. The average and medium farm sizes are about 2.0 ha and 1.2 ha,
respectively. Over 95% of the holdings are owner operated. The salient
features of the three project areas are:
Damanganga      Heran     Karjan       Total
Rural Population               240,000       60,000    150,000    450,000
Percentage Tribal                75%           46%       17%         52%
CCA (ha)                        56,100       32,100     56,200    144,400
Land and Water Resources
2.04      Climate.  Most of the annual rainfall occurs during the monsoon
period from mid-June through September; during the rest of the year it is
negligible and erratic. The average rainfall is 1,800 mm in Damanganga; 900
mm in Heran and Karjan. The winters are mild and temperatures peak in May;
however, in Damanganga, the temperatures are moderated by the influence of the
sea.
2.05      Soils and Topography.  The topography of the Heran project area is
generally flat while the Damanganga and Karjan areas are gently rolling.  The
areas are intersected by extensive networks of small rivers and other natural
drainage channels that generally meet the surface drainage requirements, ex-
cept in a limited area of the Damanganga scheme near the coast. Fine-textured,



- 10 -
deep (over 90 cm) brown soils that are derived from basaltic parent-material
cover 75-90% of the project areas. These soils are moderatly well-drained
and have a tendency to crack vertically during ths dry season. The gently
sloping upland areas are covered with moderately deep (45-90 cm) gravelly,
fine textured soils that are well drained. About 10% of the Damanganga area
is covered by very deep, fine-textured coastal alluvial soils with imperfect
internal drainage.
2.06      Surface Water Resources.  The three project rivers all depend on
monsoon rainfall for their run-off and more than ')5% of the flow occurs during
the June-September period. The Damanganga and Heran Rivers both have a major
part of their catchments in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, respectively.
There are no interstate agreements regarding any eventual sharing of the
waters.  Consequently, only run-off from the unintercepted catchment located
in Gujarat has been taken into account in the water balance studies. Because
of the topography in the catchments, it is highly unlikely that the upper
riparian States would be able to divert all run-off from their catchments.
Furthermore, return flows would occur from upstream irrigation, but have not
been taken into account in the formal water balance of the project areas.
Thus, the following table gives a conservative estimate of the annual surface
water resources available to the projects:
Damanganga       Heran     Karjan
50% dependable yield (Mm)                702            271       623
75% dependable yield (Mm )               640            186       446
2.07      Groundwater Development.  At present, irrigation from wells plays
only a limited role in the development of the scheme areas.  However, when
year-round water celiveries from the canal systems become available, the infil-
tration from return flows is likely to at least doible--and could quadruple
--the utilizable groundwater resources. Experiencas from other projects in
Gujarat and similar areas in India indicate that the farmers rapidly respond to
the increased availability of groundwater and that wells account for 20-40% of
the total water used for irrigation inside the comnand areas.  This development
would be particularly important for irrigation of cash crops, additional hot
season crops, high water demanding perennials, and for added security during
extended drought periods.
Present Level of Agricultural Development
2.08      Damanganga.  The most important feature of the command is the large
area of natural grass land, which can easily be adapted to orchards, and
ultimately vegetables. The grass is grown as a reLatively high value, rainfed
cash crop. It is harvested annually, baled and so:d principally in Bombay as
fodder for milk animals. Historically, most of the command area was covered
by grass, but over time, and especially over the last 15 years, much of it has
been converted to paddy (38% of CCA) and to orcharcds (10%). At present, about
45% of the area remains under grass. Besides paddy, the main kharif crops are
minor millets (3%) and pulses (3%). Rabi crops are confined to pulses (9%),
sown in paddy stubbles and grown on residual moisture, and a small area of
wheat (1%). Fruits--primarily mango, but also chiku, guava, pineapple, papaya



- 11 -
and banana--occupy some 10% of the command. The mangoes, well known for their
high quality, are sold primarily on the Bombay market. The fruit trees are
provided with supplementary irrigation from dug wells (about 2,000 are located
in the command). Sugarcane (1%) and kharif and rabi vegetables are also grown
around the wells. Paddy, the main rainfed crop has a relatively low yield due
to the short rainfall season, and its unpredictability. Despite the relatively
high average annual rainfall, its uncertain timing renders it ineffective in
meeting the water requirements of the high-yielding and improved varieties.
Yields of fruits and vegetables are high where well water is available. A
dairy has recently been established in the area and milk production is increas-
ing rapidly. Most farmers have cows or buffalos and derive a significant part
of their earnings from milk.  Given favorable climate and soils and established
links to urban markets (principally Bombay), it is expected that a rapid
transformation of the area will take place once irrigation water becomes
available.
2.09      Heran.  The command area has no irrigation facilities beyond a
limited number of low yielding dug wells which are scattered throughout the
area. The cropping pattern is kharif-oriented with cotton--mostly local
herbaceum varieties--as the major crop (32% of the CCA). Pearl millet (26%)
is the staple foodgrain of the area. Hybrid varieties are extensively grown
but downy mildew and ergot have decreased yields. In spite of the low rain-
fall, rainfed paddy covers about 18% of the area. The paddy is usually
drilled using short duration, tall varieties. Groundnuts of the spreading,
long duration varieties are grown on 11% of the area. The principal rabi crop
is local sorghum (10%). Due to the limited irrigation facilities, the area
under wheat is negligible. The area under bananas is small (0.4%) but the
crop is irrigated and yields are high.
2.10      Karjan.  The cropping pattern is two seasonal, with 70-75% of the
land under cultivation in the kharif and rabi seasons. The dominant crop is
rainfed cotton which covers 54% of the CCA. As in Heran, mostly locally
improved herbaceum varieties are grown. The varieties are late maturing and
frequently affected by failure of the late rains. Consequently, the average
yield is low (about 0.4 tons/ha). The main foodgrain is rabi sorghum which is
grown on 17% of the area. The kharif foodgrains are drilled paddy (4%), pearl
millet (4%), sorghum (2%) and pulses (6%)--primarily long duration pigeon pea.
Some bananas, guavas and miscellaneous vegetables are grown around wells.
C. The Ukai-Kakrapar Modernization Area
General
2.11      The Ukai-Kakrapar scheme is located on the Tapi River in southern
Gujarat. The southern part of the area has relatively high rainfall (1,500 mm)
but it declines to about 600 mm in the northern part. Because of the moderat-
ing influence of the sea, there is little variation in the temperatures over
the year. Construction of the Kakrapar weir and its associated canal system
was started in the early 1950s. The weir was completed and irrigation started
in 1957 but construction of the canal system continued for another decade.
The Kakrapar scheme was designed to serve a CCA of about 225,000 ha (subse-
quently revised to 204,000 ha). In 1960, construction was started on the Ukai
dam across the Tapi to provide carry over storage for the Kakrapar command and



- 12 -
to extend the CCA by another 152,000 ha. The dam was essentially completed in
1971 and the final works on the Ukai canal system will be finished in 1980.
2.12      The command is one of the most densely populated areas in Gujarat.
Surat (population about 472,000 in 1971) is located in the center of the area
and Bharuch (92,000) and Valsad (55,000) at its rorthern and scuthern fringe,
respectively. In addition, there is a network of about a dozen smaller market
towns with a total population of about 240,000 inside the area. The rural
population in the command is a'bout 1,400,000. Because of the high population
density, farms are small--average size about 2.2 ha--and almost half the
agricultural labor force is landless. In spite of the large number of land-
less agriculturaL workers, there is a significant immigration of laborers from
Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra during the sugarcane harvesting season. It
is estimated that 50-60% of the population have incomes below the poverty
level (US$75). In spite of high pressure on land, over 95% of the farms are
owner-operated.
Soils, Topography and Drainage
2.13      The Kakrapar command slopes gently towards the west and becomes
almost completely flat near the coast. In general, the micro-topography is
determined by small rivers and natural drainage ways. However, land shaping
and grading have been carried out over most of the area and virtually all
the land has slopes below 1%. The soils of the command area consist of
montmorillonite clays.  Though they were initiallv formed as residual deposits
from disintegrated basalt, they have been denuded from the place of origin,
transported by river flows and laid as flood plain deposits. During their
transportation, they have been intermixed with granular material and, there-
fore, they vary in texture, stratification and phvsico-chemical properties.
They now form alluvial deposits of stratified layers of residual clay inter-
mixed with sands and silt. Because of high clay content, the soils crack on
drying--usually to one meter depth--and swell on wetting. The cracks are
numerous, thin and vertical.
2.14      In general, the permeability of the soils is low, few field drains
have been constructed by the farmers and the capacity of main drains is inade-
quate because of poor design, irregular natural gradients, siltation and heavy
growth of typha (cattail reeds). As a result, the water table is rising (at
least 15 cm per year) and the problem of waterlogging is increasing. In
1967/68, before perennial supply was available from Ukai dam, post-monsoon
water tables were within 3 m of the surface in about 50,000 ha; in 1976/77,
after perennial irrigation, the areas affected by high water table had
increased to 155,000 ha. Some 22,000 ha located along the coast are affected
by restricted natural drainage and occasional flooding by sea water during
high tides. Although some attempts have been made in the past to protect and
reclaim this land, the success has been limited and most of the areas are
fallow.
Irrigation and Agricultural Development
2.15      Fertile land, perennial water supply from the Ukai dam, good
marketing facilities, easy access to major urban centers and export markets,
rapid development of agro-industries and progressive farmers provide the



- 13 -
basis for what could be one of the most productive agricultural areas in
India. However, because of the inadequacies of the irrigation system and
poor water management practices, the actual production is far below its
potential.
2.16      In a historic perspective, the shortcomings of the Kakrapar part
of the command are easily explained: at Independence, there was a great deal
of experience available on large-scale surface irrigation in India. However,
this experience, which dated back to the nineteenth century, was largely
limited to two typical situations: (i) supplementary irrigation of paddy,
primarily in the eastern delta areas (Cauvery, Krishna, Godavari and Mahanadi);
and (ii) extensive irrigation of a limited number of upland crops to provide
insurance against drought and famine (primarily in the Punjab but also in
some parts of the Deccan). Virtually, no experience existed on irrigation
of mixed crops in intermediate rainfall areas. Consequently, when Kakrapar
was planned in the early 1950s, the design standards and the management
practices adopted were inappropriate for local agro-climatic conditions.
2.17      Initially, the inadequacies of the irrigation system were obscured
by the adverse impact of the unreliable irrigation supply from the Kakrapar
weir due to variable river flows. However, even after a firm perennial
supply was available from the Ukai dam, it became apparent that the main
constraints to a highly productive cultlvation could be found in the design
and operation of the canal system. The advent of the "green revolution"
made the adopted standards and practices even more inappropriate. The system
did not permit timely and reliable water deliveries to the farms, which is a
prerequisite for a modern agriculture based on high yielding, high value
crops. Thus, the unreliable water supplies, combined with the rapidly wor-
sening drainage problems have provided a clear disincentive to many farmers
to use irrigation water.
2.18      At present, the irrigated area in the Kakrapar system is about
85,000 ha or about 42% of the reported CCA. However, the reported CCA of
204,000 ha includes 20,000 ha of cultivable waste land, 12,000 ha of coastal,
salt affected lands that are not cultivated and 18,000 ha of grass land or
perennially fallow land that either has very low production potential or
appears to be out of command. In addition, there are local high spots that
cannot be irrigated by gravity. Consequently, the net CCA appears to be
only about 150,000 ha. Thus, the actual irrigated area is about 56% of the
net CCA. About 72,000 ha are cultivated under rainfed conditions.
2.19      The main irrigated crops are:  paddy (40% of the area), sugarcane
(30%), wheat (10%), cotton (6%) and banana (3%). Because of the varying
rainfall over the area, there are significant variations in the cropping
pattern in the various parts of the command:

34,100 ha)
The importance of paddy declines with the monsoon. rainfall from the south to
the north.  Upland crops (sorghum and groundnuts in kharif, wheat in rabi and
cotton) are primarily confined to the northern parts of the Kakrapar command
area. Sugarcane and bananas are grown in all parts of the command, but are
concentrated in the central area, and in the upper reaches of the distribu-
tion system'. The general time trend in the cropping pattern is towards more
perennial crops End paddy, while the area under cotton is decreasing, primarily
because of deteriorating drainage conditions.
2.20      Since sugarcane and bananas both use more water and give much
higher returns per ha, it is clear that the Central Zone of the command
receives an disproportionately large share of the irrigation benefits. The
net returns per ha of CCA are approximately 1-1/2 - 2 times higher in the
Central Zone than in the two other zones. However, the benefits are not only
inequitably distributed between the main zones of the scheme, they are even
more inequitably distributed within the zones. Typically, the irrigation
intensities are high at the head of the distribution system while the water
often does not reach the tail-end of the distribution system. Consequently,
there are large areas close to the coast that are not irrigated. Also, inside
the chaks (i.e., the areas--typically 40 ha--served by a government irrigation
outlet) the water is inequitably distributed. A review of irrigation intensi-
ties inside 88 chaks in the Kakrapar system reveaL the following pattern:
Annual Irrigation

Upper third of chak                       117%

/a  The sum of the areas irrigated in kharif, rabi
and hot weather divided by the CCA of the chak.



- 15 -
2.21      The inequitable distribution of irrigation benefits is a result of
excessive losses and lack of operational control which results in inadequate
and unreliable supplies to the tailends of the system. Thus, a modernization
program including lining, reduction in chak sizes, construction of additional
control structures, selective increase in canal capacities, and drainage
works would not only result in increased agricultural production but with
stronger management would also ensure that the berefits are more equitably
distributed.
D. Saurashtra Coastal Development Area
General
2.22      The Saurashtra Coastal Development scheme is located in Gujarat
along the South Coast of the Saurashtra Peninsula. The narrow coastal plain
has long been known as a very fertile and productive tract, with orchards and
vegetable gardens in addition to intensive field crops. Due to the low and
unreliable monsoon rainfall 1/ and the lack of extensive surface water
irrigation systems, farmers in the area are heavily dependent on groundwater
for irrigation. The water is obtained from shallow open wells, tapping a
productive aquifer which extends inland for 5-7 km along the entire coastal
plain. Prior to the early 1960's, when limits to the rate of groundwater
extraction were set by the available human and animal power, a delicate
balance between the discharge and recharge of groundwater was maintained.
However, si'nce the introduction and expansion of motorized pumping, the dis-
charge rate has exceeded the recharge rate, and the underlying saline water
of the aquifer system has intruded into the fresh water body. Although some
deterioration in groundwater quality was first noted in the 1950's and 60's, it
was not until 1970 that a problem of regional scale had developed. The most
heavily affected area lies along a coastal strip of about 160 km long between
Madhavpur and Una. Within this region, the area affected by saline groundwater
has increased from about 35,000 ha in 1971 to 100,000 ha in 1977, and the area
irrigated by groundwater has been reduced from approximately 24,500 ha to
16,900 ha, as wells have been abandoned.
2.23      The population living in the salinity affected areas of the Saurashtra
scheme is about 280,000. The population density per cultivated ha in Junagadh
district is the same as the average for Gujarat State. Veraval is the largest
town and is likely to develop further as a fishing port and market center.
Land and Water Resources
2.24      The Saurashtra coastal area has limestones of Gaj and Dwarka beds,
milliolitic limestones and recent alluvium in a 10-15 km belt along the coast
line. The Gaj and Dwarka beds consist of alternating compact limestone and
impervious clay beds and are inland from the milliolitic limestones, which
1/   The average monsoon rainfall is about 600 mm on the coastal plain with a
coefficient of variability exceeding 50%. The temperatures are moderated
by the influence of the sea. However, because of high wind velocities,
the evapotranspiration of crops is the highest in Gujarat.



- 16 -
lie along the sea coast. The latter consists of banks of shale and hard
compact limestone but have solution cavities through which groundwater flows.
The recent alluvial deposits along the coastal belt have good soil moisture
retention capacity, gentle to flat topography and thus form good horticultural
land; they vary in depth from 25 to 100 cm; their texture is loam to clay loam
near the coast becoming sandy loam further inland. Because of their proximity
to the sea and their permeability, the areas most severely affected by saline
intrusion are to be found on the recent alluvial deposits and the milliolitic
limestones. The salt water intrusion results largely from the upward movement
of the freshwater-saltwater interference and replacements of the freshwater
deficit by salt water.
2.25      The catchment area of this section of t:he coastal plan between
Madhavpur and Una is 5,880 km2; of this area, 1,580 km2 is intercepted by
reservoirs serving medium irrigation systems, leaving a balance of unregulated
catchment of 4,300 km2. The runoff to rainfall coefficient is about 20%.
Thus, in an average year with 700 mm of rainfall, the run-off to the sea from
the unregulated catchment is about 600 Mm3. The small streams in Saurashtra
are flashy; they reach their peak a few hours after heavy rainfall and subside
quickly. The base flow is virtually non-existent: and most of the run-off
occurs after a relatively small number of heavy rains. Some 90% of the rain-
fall occurs during the monsoon season from late June through September and
in this period run-offs are relatively frequent. There is a fairly high
probability of post-monsoon storms generating run-off during October and in
some years in November.
Irrigation and Agricultural Development
2.26      The most important crops in Junagadh district are groundnuts (42%
of the area), pearl millet (26%), sorghum (8%), wheat (5%), and sugarcane (5%).
About 20% of the gross cropped area is irrigated, mostly from private wells.
Foodgrains are grown on nearly half of the irrigated area, 33% being under
wheat. Cotton is the next most important irrigated crop (27%). Due to the
relatively large livestock population in the district, fodder is a fairly
important irrigated crop, and is grown on 9% of thle irrigated area.  Sugarcane,
fruit (4%) and vegetables (2%) are concentrated in the coastal areas, and are
almost entirely dependent on wells. The effect of the groundwater salinity
on the vegetation has become increasingly apparent. Some of the farmers have
shifted their pumping installations towards fresh water zones, resulting in
further travel of the saline water. In the absence of fresh water, some of
the farmers use saline groundwater for protective irrigation and this affects
the soil structure and salt balance of the soil. As a result, the yields of
sugarcane and other irrigated crops in the area have been drastically reduced.
E. Agricultural Supporting Services
Agricultural Research
2.27      Since 1973, Gujarat Agricultural University (GAU) has been responsi-
ble for agricultural research. Its four campuses--Anand, Dantiwada, Junagadh
and Navsari--are located in different agro-climatic zones. The University has



- 17 -
seven main research stations, specializing in different crops, and about 50
regional stations. In general, Gujarat's plant breeding programs have been
highly successful. In particular, the research station at Jamnagar has
achieved impressive results in the development of hybrid pearl millet. Large-
ly due to this research, the all-India yields of pearl millet have increased
faster than those of any other kharif crop. Significant contributions have
also been made in the development of long staple hybrid cotton. However,
research on dry-land farming technology and water management has not achieved
the same level of success as the plant breeding programs.
2.28      Research on irrigated agriculture is carried out primarily at the
Navsari campus of GAU, which is located in the Ukai-Kakrapar command and on
15 trial-cum-demonstration (TCD) farms. The main focus of this research has
been to determine water requirements in relation to soil types, climate and
critical stages of crop growth. So far, relatively little attention has
been given to irrigation practices and land development for irrigation.
Results are mixed, as farmers do not readily accept demonstrations under these
controlled conditions, which they regard as not adaptable to their own farms.
At the same time, many of these TCD farms do not have adequate staff and equip-
ment to properly fulfill their research function.
Agricultural Extension Services
2.29      Agricultural extension is the responsibility of the Department of
Agriculture (DA). The administrative set-up is presently being reorganized
--with financial assistance from IDA (Cr. No. 862-IN, 1978, US$53.4 M)--
in accordance with the "training and visit" (T&V) system. The basic elements
of this reorganization are:
(a)  Transfer of the Village Level Workers (VLW), who are
the primary contact with the farmers, to the admin-
istrative control of DA;
(b)  Strengthen applied agricultural research and establish
a better link between research and extension; and
(c)  Increase staff mobility at all levels.
Under the scheme, the VLW would work only on extension, covering 500 to 800
families, through a system of visiting groups of 60-100 farmers on a regular
basis every two weeks.
Agricultural Inputs
2.30      There is a well developed system for distribution and sale of seeds,
fertilizers and pesticides throughout the State. Certified seeds are produced
both by the District Panchayats, under the guidance of Agricultural Department
(AD), and by the State Cooperative Marketing Federation. They are distributed
primarily through the cooperative marketing societies. Gujarat is more than
self-sufficient in the production of nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizers
(the Gujarat State Fertilizer Corporation (GSFC), a joint venture between the
GOG and the private sector, is India's second largest manufacturer). Fertili-
zers and pesticides are distributed through both cooperative marketing socie-
ties and approved private retailers. There are about 6,000 distributors, of
which 5,000 are cooperatives, and inputs are usually available within easy
reach of the markets.



18 -
Farm Mechanization
2.31      There are an estimated 16,000 tractors in Gujarat or 1.6 tractors
per 1,000 ha, which is below the national average. Most of the tractors are
owned by individual farmers but group ownership is not uncommon. The Agro-
Industries Corporation has recently established a network of "Agro-Service
Centers" which provide repair facilities for tractors and implements and
custom hiring services (at a rate of Rs 30 per hour for a 50 hp tractor).
They also provide training facilities for mechanics and drivers. The private
sector, however, handles most of the sales and repairs of tractors and imple-
ments.
Transport, Marketing and Processing
2.32      With about half of the area under cash crops, Gujarat has a well
developed system for agricultural marketing and processing. Most of the
trade is through regulated markets that serve a specified area, usually
within a 10 km radius. The 280 regulated markets are under the control of
Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees. Some 30 markets have not yet been
regulated, mainly due to resistance from vested interests. Licensed traders
are allowed to operate inside the service areas of the regulated markets.
Normally, these traders pay the same price -- at farm gate -- as the farmers
would get at t]he regulated market. About three-quarters of the storage and
processing facilities are owned by the private sector, with the remainder
provided by the public and cooperative sectors. In general, the present
system for marlceting and processing, which is highly competitive, has
responded quiclkly to increased output of both foodgrains and cash crops.
2.33      The rail and main road networks in Gujarat are generally well
developed and provide good access to the project areas. However, the existing
road networks within the commands are inadequate to meet the projected trans-
portation needs of productive irrigated areas.
Agricultural Credit
2.34      The organization for institutional credit to farmers follows the
normal pattern in India. The cooperative banks, which provide short (up to
one year) and medium-term (one to five years) credit at an interest rate of
about 13%, are organized on a three tier basis with the Gujarat State Coop-
erative bank at the State level, 18 central cooperative banks at the district
level, and 8,700 primary cooperative credit societies at the village level.
The cooperative movement has always been strong in Gujarat and about 80% of
the farmers are members. The State Cooperative Land Development Banks (SLDB)
with about one million members, has 182 branches. It provides long-term (up
to 15 years) loans at an interest rate of about 11%. In recent years, the
recovery performance of the cooperative banks has been poor but GOG is under-
taking a program to restore the financial viabiLity of these institutions. 1/

Project", IBRD Report No. 2404a-IN.

Commercial Banks (CB), which provide all three types of credit, have, since
1969, rapidly expanded their lending for agricultural purposes and they now
account for about 15% of all loans to farmers.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Main Project Components
3.01      The project would consist of financing a five-year time-slice of
Gujarat's irrigation program. The components of the project would be:
(a) Completion of the dams and major canals and partial comple-
tion 1/ of irrigation service blocks on three on-going major
irrigation schemes (Damanganga, with a CCA of 56,100 ha, Heran,
32,100 ha and Karjan, 56,200 ha); and improving the command
area road network (580 km of new and improved roads);
(b) Modernization of irrigation facilites on about 52,000 ha of
which 33,000 ha would be completely modernized during the
five-year project period; drainage improvements on about
20,000 ha; and about 190 km of village roads in Ukai-Kakrapar,
Gujarat's largest existing irrigation scheme;
(c) Construction of storage and distribution facilities to provide
supplies for the irrigation of about 25,000 ha of coastal
areas in Saurashtra, where the groundwater is affected by
salt-water intrusion from the sea;
(d) Operational and management improvements (RWS) on existing and
new schemes;
(e)  A training center for land development and water management
specialists that would fill the cadre of the special Command
Area Development Department to be established under the project;
(f) Monitoring and evaluation studies; and
(g) Financing of consultants, incremental staff, equipment and
special studies for the preparation of irrigation projects
in Gujarat and other states.

3.03      Dams.  Three dams would be financed under the project.  They are
described in Volume III, Annex 3 and the salient features are summmarized in
Table 2.  The Damanganga and Heran dams are comprised of: earth fill embank-
ments with clay cores to impermeable bed-rock; and masonry non-overflow and
spillway sections that are provided with drainage galleries. The spillway
gates are of radial design and operable by both eilectric powered and manual
lift mechanisms. The Karjan dam was originally designed as a masonry struc-
ture, but it is now planned for concrete construction. The design and
construction methods of the dams have been reviewed by GO! and IDA and found
adequate from the standpoint of structural stability, functional efficiency



- 21 -
and safety. GOG has appointed an independent panel of experts, with qualifi-
cations and terms of reference acceptable to IDA, who would routinely review
dam safety and efficiency. The panel includes an engineering geologist, a
flood hydrologist and a dam design/construction engineer.  This panel would
visit the damsites and meet periodically as required--not less than once in 12
months--to review and evaluate design and construction practices, and to make
specific recommendations to GOG concerning: embankment safety; foundation and
abutment integrity; and spillway adequacy. An agreement has been reached with
GOG that it would maintain the expert panel until the dams have been completed
and their performance during the first filling has been assessed.
3.04      The dams are designed to store surplus monsoon inflow during July
through September for later releases during the rabi and hot weather seasons
for pre-monsoon early sowing irrigations. The Heran dam would also provide
carry-over storage from one year to another. The operations for this type of
reservoir with large variations in the inflow include seasonal decision points
for adjustments of the cropping pattern on the basis of the water available in
storage. Thus, the area irrigated in rabi would be determined each upon the
basis of water in storage at the end of September. Given the conservative
estimates of inflows (para 2.06), nominal shortages (less than 10%) during the
kharif season have been accepted in the computerized reservoir simulations
carried out by GOG for the feasibility studies; 1/ the water supply in all the
schemes is adequate-for the proposed cropping pattern.
3.05      Irrigation Systems.  Given the past success of agricultural research
in the State; the well educated and progressive farmers; the easy access to
both domestic and urban markets and export markets; and the well developed
network of processing and marketing facilities, the prospects for a sustained
high growth rate for agricultural production are favorable. However, as
discussed in Volume II, this growth is likely to be associated with the fol-
lowing changes in crops and cultivation practices:
(a)  High value cash crops will become more important and
coarse grains less important;
(b)  The cropping pattern will become more complex;
(c)  Most future varieties will have shorter duration than
at present;
(d)  Crops will be planted at their optimum days; and
(e)  Irrigations have to be given at critical stages of
crop growth;
1/   The feasibility studies were based on 30-year streamflow and rainfall
records and took into account upstream, domestic and industrial water
uses, effective rainfall, reservoir inflows, evaporation and spills
and estimated irrigation system losses together with crop water require-
ments (derived by the modifed Penman method) for the annual cropping
patterns expected to be adopted. Overall systems efficiencies--dam
to plant--were assumed at 50% for these lined systems.



- 22 -
These changes have the following implications for the planning, design and
operation of irrigation projects.
(a) The wat:er supply has to be reliable, i.e., the farmers
must bse ensured that they can get water at the time when
the crop needs it;
(b)  Operation of the pro-jects, will no longer be done in
accordance with the traditional irrigation seasons,
instead different kharif crops will be planted at dif-
ferent times, which requires a more flexible operation
of the system; and
(c)  The peak carrying capacity of the system has to be
higher than at present, particularly in the lower
parts of the system, to permit RWS.
In order to ensure a timely and reliable water supply to all farmers in the
command area, the entire conveyance system for the Heran and Karjan schemes
would be lined from the dam intake down to irrigation turnouts serving approx-
imately 8 ha bloclks. (Implied in this criterion is the objective that no
field would be further away from a lined channel t:han 300 m). The Damanganga
scheme is located in an area with high rainfall ard relatively impermeable
soils and the available river flows are ample to meet scheme requirements. In
this scheme the lining would be carried down to the 20 ha level. However, the
irrigation turnouts would serve 8 ha blocks. Furthermore, distributaries in
the Damanganga scheme, with a capacity between 10 cusecs and 100 cusecs, would
be lined selectively depending upon the estimated seepage losses from unlined
channels. The lining would reduce conveyance losses and maintenance, and,
more importantly, would allow improved operation of the system. The expend-
itures for this and for construction of unlined field channels to each indi-
vidual farm would be met from GOG's budget. The distribution system (from
minors down) would be in pipes wherever sufficient natural head is available.
It is estimated that 30-40% of the Damanganga CCA, 10-20% of Heran and 20-30%
of Karjan would be served by a piped distribution network.
3.06      The minor distributiorl system would be designed "from the tail
up", i.e., the alignment of minors and sub-minors would not be finalized until
a tentative layout of the field channels has been prepared. This procedure
would require large-scale survey work and increased allocation of professional
manpower for the survey, planning and design of the minor distribution system.
Chak sizes would be based on topography, soils, cropping patterns and farm
sizes, but would not normally exceed 20 ha.  For o-erational purposes, the
chaks would be broken down into 8 ha sub-chaks eaclh served by a gated turnout.
In order to permit an efficient and equitable operation of the system, measur-
ing devices (such as standing wave flumes, V-notch weirs) would be provided
throughout the system down to the chak outlet. All-weather service roads
would be provided along all channels with a capacity above 50 cusecs and all
weather bicycle/motorcyle paths along all minors and sub-minors. A modern
communication system would be provided in the catchment area (for flood
control purposes) and at various control points on the canal, the dam and the



- 23 -
divisional headquarters. Planning and construction of field drains within
the chaks and drains connecting to the main drainage system would proceed
concurrently with the distribution system.
3.07      Command Area Roads.  All-weather road access between farms and
markets is essential   The roads program, which is described in Volume III,
Annex 4, would comprise improvements to about 237 km of existing roads,
reconstruction of about 138 km of roads and tracks and construction of some
204 km of new roads. The principal planning criteria would be: (i) to
provide all-weather road access to within a distance of about 3 km from almost
all parts of the command areas and to villages having ever 1,500 inhabitants;
(ii) to utilize existing road alignments and new canal embankments whenever
technically and economically appropriate; and (iii) to bypass village centers
as far as possible. Project roads would be designed and constructed to Indian
Road Congress standards and minimum widths for right-of-way, formation and
pavement would be 18 m, 7.5 m and 3.7 m, respectively. All roads would have
adequate drainage, hard shoulders and waterbound macadam pavements with black
top surfacing. In addition to the project roads, the agreed layouts include
some 461 km of existing black top roads which have been identified and listed
as constituting essential links in the networks. An agreement was reached
with GOG that whenever necessary, these existing roads would be upgraded to
project standards in phase with project road development.
Ukai-Kakrapar Modernization
3.08      General.  Modernization of the irrigation., drainage and road infra-
structure and the introduction of improved management practices could yield
exceptionally high benefits. However, since the irrigation system is already
in operation, the potential loss of agricultural production due to extended
and repeated canal closures for remodelling work can, under certain condi-
tions, outweigh both the direct cost of the works and the potential benefits
of modernization. These problems require careful planning, design and imple-
mentation. However, since both the problems and solutions to a large extent
are unique to a specific scheme, it is necessary to proceed slowly initially,
and to learn by experience, in order to avoid unnecessary costs. A step-by-
step approach is thus the only viable course for modernization of the Ukai-
Kakrapar command, from both an economic and an engineering standpoint. This
would involve a large-scale pioneering exercise over the first 2-3 years
during which the planning, implementation, organization and resulting benefits
would be carefully monitored and fed back into the current and future project
planning. This staged approach would be restricted to specific segments of the
irrigation system which typify different stages and aspects of the moderniza-
tion problems. The initial areas would be limited to enable both control of
the implementation and manageable evaluation of the results. This approach
would also help develop sufficient trained staff for a gradual build-up of
the implementation program.
3.09      Project Works.  The IDA-assisted project would, over a 5-year period,
undertake a complete package of works in specific areas of the Kakrapar part
of the command. It is expected that the remaining parts of the command would
be modernized gradually after the completion of the IDA time-slice. However,
the economic viability of the works carried out during the first-year period
is not contingent on the rate of implementation of subsequent modernization

works. The project works are described in detaiL in Volume III, Annexes 1
and 4 and summarized below:
3.10      The distribution system covering two blocks of 9,800 and 28,200 ha
respectively under the Kakrapar Right Bank Canal (RBC) would be scheduled for
modernization. In this part of the command, perennial crops--i.e., sugar-
cane and bananas--cover only a small part of the area and regular and longer
canal closures are thus feasible. The works would involve: enlarging and
selected lining (above 20 cusecs) of distributaries; lining all minors and
sub-minors down to chaks of mangeable sizes; drainage works on a sub-catchment
basis; and construction of necessary control strtictures and measuring devices.
The works would be staged: in the initial 2 year period some 10,000 ha under
the Hajira Branch Canal 1/ would be taken up and in the following 3 year
period--with some overlap--an additional area of about 10,000 ha under the
Karanj distributary would be completed and work would be initiated on the
remaining 18,200 ha under the Hajira Branch Canal. As part of the Kakrapar
RBC, some 2,000 ha of salt-affected coastal lands located at the tail-ends of
the distribution system would be protected from tidal flows (through construc-
tion of sea dykes and double-gated tidal regulatcrs), provided with irrigation
and drainage works, and then fully reclaimed (through a program of leaching
and land development). The coastal reclamation would be associated with a
settlement program (para 4.13).
3.11      The distribution and drainage system covering an area of about
14,000 ha under the Umbrath Branch Canal in the Kakrapar Left Bank Command
would also be modlernized. The works in this area would be carried out to the
same standards as on the Right Bank. However, since a large part of the area
is under perennial crops, the remodelling works would be carried out during
shorter canal closure periods. Standby arrangements for secondary pumping
from wells and impounded drainage channels would be tested. If these con-
struction methods prove feasible, recourse would be made to channel diversions
and small coffer dams in order to continue irrigation supply during recon-
struction. During the first phase, 3,000-4,000 ha would be covered, followed
by 10,000-11,000 ha in the second phase. A special feature of the Umbrath
Branch modernization would be a pilot operation undertaken with farmer par-
ticipation. It would test the technical, administrative and economic
feasibility of conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water to meet the
heavy water demand for sugarcane. This pilot exercise would include both
direct and augmentation tubewells on a limited basis and would examine the
role of dugwells for individual farms. Coastal raclamation works would cover
an area of about 3,000 ha.
3.12      High priority drainage works would be completed for an area of about
20,000 ha and be initiated for the remaining 37,500 ha under the Surat Branch
Canal in the Left Bank Command. This area is seriously waterlogged and main
and secondary drains would be provided largely through the improvement of
existing natural drainage channels and construction of maintenance roads along
the channels. A specific program of maintenance, on a regular cycle, using a
combination of equipment and hand labor would be devised and instituted.
1/   Additional capacity would be provided in the Branch and one minor to
supply the Hazira Fertilizer Plant.



- 25 -
3.13      Construction of 31 km new, reconstruction of about 72 km and improve-
ments to 85 km of existing farm-to-market roads in the areas covered by the
modernization and drainage works would be undertaken. The road program would
be planned and constructed in accordance with the criteria adopted for the new
schemes (para 3.07).
Saurashtra Coastal Development Scheme
3.14      General.  GOG has developed a comprehensive scheme for water conser-
vation, direct irrigation and artificial recharge along the southern coast
of Saurashtra which has been adversely affected by the intrusion of saline
groundwater from the sea. The scheme includes a comprehensive package of
run-off conservation measures and small reservoirs for direct irrigation.
IDA's assistance in the scheme, over a five year period, would include the
following components:
(a) Construction of 14 (17) 1/ gated or ungated regulators
at the mouths of the rivers and provision of lift irri-
gation facilities at the reservoirs;
(b) Construction of about 150 (200) check dams along the nallas
and rivers and making arrangements for the establishment
of individual or cooperative lift schemes at the check dams;
(c) Construction of 1 (2) reservoir scheme for regulated
releases to downstream lift schemes;
(d) Construction of about 1,000 (10,000) "gully plugs" i.e.
small check structures across natural drains; and
(e) Afforestation of 10,000 ha (10,000 ha) on government waste
land and community owned land in the upper catchments.
3.15      The 3 existing and the 17 planned regulators would control all the
important streams discharging to the sea. The total storage volume of these
structures would be 119 Mm3 or about one-fifth of the total run-off. An
analysis of rainfall and run-off data for medium irrigation schemes located
in the area indicates that the storages of tidal regulators and the other
structures that control all the important streams discharging to the area,
would fill up three to four times during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons.
Since some of these run-offs would occur within .a couple of weeks of each
other, it is estimated that on the average a volume equal to 2-1/2 times the
storage would be available for irrigation, or approximately half the annual
flow. It is expected that water deficits would occur at the reservoirs in
very low rainfall years (i.e., about one year in five). The annual irrigation
resulting from these structures is estimated at 20,000 ha.
3.16      Regulators.  Gated regulators on 7 rivers are included in GOG's
program of which 4 would be financed under the credit. These gated masonary
1/   Figures in parenthesis indicate the scope of GOG's complete scheme.

structures would serve the duaL purpose of arresting the inflow of sea water
into the rivers and providing a reservoir of fresh water for irrigation, to
be distributed using low-lift pumps. Generally the gates remain closed, but
are operated during floods to prevent excessive submergence of upstream land.
Ten ungated regulators would be constructed on smaller streams where the
height of tide water is limited. The locations of regulators are shown on Map
14609. Depending on the topography, a number of pumping stations would be
constructed at the reservoirs.  Water would be pwnped to the highest level in
an irrigation blcck through a rising main, feeding into a small storage tank.
From the tank it would be distributed to the fields through pipes or open
lined channels, depending on the topography. The outlets from the irrigation
system would serve 8 ha areas. The credit would finance the irrigation system
for the 14 regulators built under the credit and Eor 3 existing bandharas.
The regulators that would be included under the IDA project have been selected
to ensure an economic rate of return of at least L2% for each individual
structure. I/ 2/
3.17      Check dams are a key element in the overall recharge plan.  The
structure would utilize stop-log gates to regulate water at the recession of
each flood. During prolonged stream flow periods the gates would be removed
so that the flood flows would pass down the stream channel unrestricted.
Through the repeated filling and emptying of the pools behind the gates, the
water would percolate through the wetted perimeter into the ground water it
would thus be available for supplementary irrigation to kharif crops and for
the essential early waterings to plant and establish rabi crops. It is also
expected that the private sector would undertake the construction and opera-
tion of pump lift schemes to utilize the water stored behind the check dams,
and the more sustained surface flows generated in the streams themselves.
3.18      Reservoir.  The storage reservoir (Sangavadi) would be constructed
at the upper reaches of a large river. It would Frovide regulated releases
to the structures further downstream to supplement the catchments of the
regulators and check dams.  Although no distribution system from the reservoir
would be financed under the credit, it is expected that some farmers would
install their own low-lift pumps.
3.19      Gully Plugs.  Additional soil and moisture conservation measures
would include smaLl stone check dams, ring bunds and similar structures for
plugging channels and gullies. Nalla plugging would also be beneficial on
the high ground above check dams as a means of increasing infiltration into
the soil mantle, and in reducing silt loads; thus, in effect, increasing the
water yield of the downstream structures. The Gabion design (rubble rock
enmeshed in galvanized wire baskets) is ideally suited for this purpose.
1/   This would imply an investment cost--in financial terms--for the storage
structure, pump installation and distribution network of less than Rs 4.0
per m3 of storage created.
2/   The estimatecl opportunity cost of capital in India is 12%.



- 27 -
3.20      Afforestation would be carried out on the higher ground of the catch-
ment areas where slopes are too steep for cultivation, and on Government and
community lands scattered throughout the coastal region. Terraces would be
constructed along the contours with seedlings planted in pits both on the
terraces and in the intervening spaces at the rate of 800 plants per hectare.
3.21      Research, Demonstration, Monitoring and Evaluation.  In association
with, but without direct financial support from the credit, GOG is undertaking
a research and demonstration program. There is a significant scope for devel-
opment of water-conserving irrigation techniques to reduce groundwater use,
and for growing more salt-resistant fruit crops such as bor, date palm, guava,
etc., in areas where the groundwater is already saline. Research on these
subjects is carried out on trial-cum-demonstration farms in the area, under
the guidance of the Gujarat Agricultural University (GAU) at Jungadh. The
GAU would also be responsible for monitoring and evaluating: (i) water
quality and soil condition changes in the area; (ii) groundwater supply,
demand and usage; (iii) crop yields, cropping patterns and intensities, crop
calendars, and agricultural production related to specific deliveries of water
from wells; (iv) input costs and farm incomes; and (v) the costs and benefits
of alternative crop varieties and planting methods.
Training Center for Land Development
and Water Management Specialists
3.22     'As a first step in a long-term program to build up a professional
cadre for irrigation management, GOG would commence, under the proposed pro-
ject, a training program in water management and land development for irrigated
agriculture. The program would comprise courses of duration varying from 6 to
9 months for recently graduated students or existing GOG personnel who hold
university degrees or diplomas in civil engineering, agronomy or agricultural
engineering. About 60 students would be trained annually. New entrants would
be absorbed into the CAD organization for their entire professional career and
in-service candidates would be required to serve a minimum of three years in
the CAD Department following completion of the course. In addition, GOG would
annually provide technical upgrading courses for some 100 agricultural and
irrigation field assistants of the two departments engaged in irrigation
management and land development. The project would assist the establishment
of a new training center to be located in or adjacent to one of the major
irrigation schemes in Gujarat, and would provide residential and training
accommodation, equipment, incremental staff salaries and training allowances,
consultant services and, to a limited extent, overseas training for the
institute's staff. An agreement has been reached with GOG that it would
commence a training program for land development and water management spe-
cialists, acceptable to IDA, by October 1, 1981. Before the new buildings
have been completed, the courses would be given at GOG's Staff Training
College in Gandhinagar.

Operational and Management Improvements
3.23       During the 1978/79 rabi season, GOG introduced Rotational Water
Supply (RWS) I1 as a pilot scheme on three of the minors in the Mahi Right
Bank Command area. GOG is encouraged with the results and is anxious to
expand RWS in the same command area and to other projects. However, large
scale introduction of RWS would require (i) a buiLd-up of considerable know-
how and organizational capabilities among the irrigation adminis-rators; and
(ii) some modifications of existing irrigation networks--primarily construc-
tion of cross regulators, measuring devices and group turnouts within the 40
ha chaks. 2/  Consequently, implementation would De constrained by a need to
learn from experience, rather than by a lack of fi-nds. Since RWS would be the
basis for operation of the new projects financed -inder the credit, it would be
essential that sufficient experience be gained rapidly.  Consequently, the
credit would finance the required works on an area of about 60,000 ha, about
half of which is expected to be located in the Mahi-Kadana command.
Monitoring and Evaluation
3.24      Under the project, improved conveyance :echnologies and more effi-
cient operational procedures would be introduced. The performance of these
innovations would be systematically monitored and evaluated during and after
project implementation. A first evaluation point would be in October 1984,
when the initial results would be reviewed. At that time the design and
operations criteria could be modified if necessary. Monitoring and evalua-
tion will be carried out on a continuous basis by GOG's PPM Cells. The PPM
Cells would, with the assistance of consultants if required, carry out the
following studies:
(a) Monitoring of water deliveries in each completed segment
of the schemes. The measurement work will be carried out
by teams deputed from the ID;
(b) Collection and tabulation of cost data related to each
component of the schemes;
(c) Measurement of crop yields, cropping intensities, crop-
ping calendars and patterns, and agricultural production
related to specific deliveries of canal- and well-water;
the cost of inputs, the volume of production, and the
resulting farm incomes 3/;
1/   For a discussion of the merits of RWS see Volume II.
2/   Under the Bombay Irrigation Act, the farmers apply for water to irrigate
a specific area under a specific crop. As proposed under RWS, the farmer
would instead be allocated a specific quantity of water which he would be
free to use to irrigate whatever area and whatever crop he chooses. This
might requires a change in the Irrigation Act.
3/   Base-line agro-economic surveys have been carried out in the new scheme
areas and are in progress in the Ukai-Kakrapar command.



- 29 -
(d)  Derivation of related costs and benefits arising from:
alternative levels of irrigation service; lined vs.
unlined minor and sub-minor canals; size of outlet com-
mands; varying levels of land development; the impact of
new varieties, planting methods, irrigation and drainage
methods and comparative standards of canal maintenance; and
(e)  A transportation study covering:  comprehensive traffic
counts; marketing patterns; seasonal traffic variations;
commodity freight charges; and vehicle and pack animal
ownership and operating costs. A special feature of
this study would be to assess the impact of road access
on cropping patterns, on marketing options and on farm
gate prices.
GOI Project Preparation Fund
3.25      The GOI has requested that US$10 M be provided--for a two year
period--for preparation of future irrigation projects for Bank Group financing.
The funds would be utilized for the following purposes:
(a)  About US$1.9 M for the establishment of 8 project prepa-
ration cells in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa,
U.P., Kerala, West Bengal, and Karnataka, and two project
preparation cells in the Center, one to deal with the
Narmada Valley development and the other for project pre-
paration of other Bank Group-financed projects;
(b)  About US$1.1 M for equipment (such as calculators, mini-
computers, office and other technical equipment and sur-
vey instruments), vehicles and other non-recurring expen-
ditures for the project preparation cells; and
(c)  About US$7.0 M for data collection, studies, consultancies,
and other project preparation and pilot works in the eight
above-mentioned States (including for Narmada development).
The data collection and studies to be financed out of the
facility would include among others: the preparation of
topographical surveys, soil surveys, geological surveys,
hydrological surveys (surface and groundwater), socio-
economic surveys, etc. The consultancy funds under this
category would pay for consultants in project preparation,
including systems analysis, watershed studies, project
implementation studies and specialized detailed designs
for major engineering structures. The project preparation
facility would also finance internationally recruited con-
sultants as may be needed. (At present, a need has been
identified in the fields of inland water transport and dam
foundation design.) The pilot project work to be financed
under the credit would be used for experiments with alter-
native canal lining materials and procedures, minor water
conveyance systems, groundwater recharge and exploitation



- 30-
systems, etc. The program and scope of these studies
would be mutually agreed among GOI, the concerned States
and the Bank Group.
C. Cost Estimates and Financial Arrangements
Cost Estimates
3.26      The total project cost, over the five-year time slice (April 1980 -
April 1985), is estimated at US$360.0 M, net of taxes and duties (which are
negligible). This amount includes a foreign exchange component of about
US$59.0 M or some 16% of project cost. The prov7isions for physical contin-
gencies range between 10% and 20% depending on t:he status of designs and cost
estimates. The physical contingency allowance for civil works average 15%.
No physical contingencies have been applied for equipment and vehicles.
Administration, engineering and design are estiniated at 15% of the civil
works cost. Detailed costs of all civil works cnd equipment have been updated
to reflect April 1980 contract prices. Expected price increases are taken as
10% in 1980, 7% in 1981-83 and 5% thereafter. Cost estimates are detailed in
Tables T-7 and T-8 and summarized below:

Financing
3.27      The proposed IDA credit of US$175.0 M would finance the foreign
exchange component (US$59.0 M) and about 39% of local cost, or about 49% of
total project cost. All expenditures for the Gujarat component would be met
from GOG's development budget which includes a GOI contribution. The credit
would be made to GOI on standard terms. Agreements have been reached with
GOI that it would: (i) make the proceeds of the credit, except disbursements
for project preparation undertaken by GOI or other States, available to GOG
on GOI's standard terms and arrangements for development assistance to the
State;s and (ii) disbursements for project preparation expenditures in other
States would be channeled to these States in accordance with GOI's standard
procedures for development assistance to the States. Agreements have been
reached with GOG that it would: (i) provide sufficient funds to execute the
project in accordance with the implementation schedule for the five-year
program supported under the credit; and (ii) after the credit has been dis-
bursed, complete the three new schemes (Damanganga, Heran and Karjan) as soon
as technically and financially feasible.
Budgetary Implications
3.28      The GOG plans to allocate about US$750 M from its budget in the
period 1978/79 through 1983/84 for the development and modernization of
irrigation schemes. This amount, representing 25% of the budget, is consis-
tent with past GOG policies. The total anticipated expenditure on major and
medium irrigation is US$400 M, excluding Narmada, which will account for
US$240 M over the next five years. The expected growth of Gujarat's economy
and the expected growth in the sources of the state government revenues,
transfers from the center and proceeds from external assistance and other
loans, are such that the Government of Gujarat will be able to finance Plan
expenditure envisaged over the next five years, including that for irrigation
development.
Procurement
3.29      Civil Works financed under the Project would cost approximately
US$174 M excluding physical contingencies, price increases, engineering and
administrative costs. Of this, about US$40 M or 23% of the civil works would
be let through International Competitive Bidding (ICB); and about US$102 M or
59% would be let through Local Competitive Bidding (LCB); and the remaining
US$32 M or 18% would be let under piecework contracts or be carried out by
GOG's departmental forces.
(a)  ICB Contracts for Dams and Main Canal Works:  US$40 M.
Works for dams and main canals in excess of US$6 M per
contract would be let in accordance with IDA-approved ICB
procedures. However, to encourage the participation of
smaller Indian contractors, tenders would be designed to
allow tendering for parts of the works (individual sched-
ules). The individual schedules would, in general, include
only one type of work (for example, earthwork or structures).



- 32 -
Indian contractors would be entitled to a 7.5% preference.
Tender documents would specify the requirements for pre-
ference eligibility and the manner of its application.
(b)  On-going LCB Contracts for Dams and Main Canal Works:
US$3.4 M. Construction of dams and main canals is in
progress and some works have been awarded under multi-year
contracts through LCB. Work on 18 su-h contracts, with an
aggregate value of US$35.3 M and about US$24.8 M worth of
work remaining, is ongoing at present. Four contracts, each
costing less than US$6 M, have been found acceptable for
financing under the project (see Volume III, Annex 6).
These four contracts were let after the pre-appraisal
mission identified them as components of the project and
would have approximately US$3.4 M wor:h of works outstanding
on April 1, 1980.
(c)  Other LCB Contracts:  US$98 M.  Most wvorks which are
individually small, scattered over a 'Large area and carried
out intermittently as determined by weather conditions,
would be let through GOG's LCB procedures which have been
reviewed and found acceptable to the Association. Contracts
which exceed a value of US$1.0 M would be subject to full
pre-action review by the Association, with the remainder
subject to ex-post review.
(d)  None-ICB/LCB Works:  US$32 M.  These works would also be
scattered, individually small and their implementation
will be governed by weather and agricultural conditions.
Because of these and other technical constraints there
would be a general lack of competitior. which would make
these works impractical for tendering. Most of these works
would instead be carried out under small piecework contracts.
Force account would be used only when required by safety,
quality considerations or when the quantities are exception-
ally difficult to estimate in advance. Force account would
be limited to US$16 M.
3.30      The Central Water Commission (CWC) of GOI has recently developed
model ICB and LCB contracts and procedures for works procurement that have
been approved by the Association. The GOG has adopted these models and
procedures and will use them for procurement of works under the project
(see volume III, Annex 6 for detailed list of major civil works).
3.31      Equipment, Instrumentation and Vehicles financed under the project
would cost approximately US$28 M excluding price contingencies. All heavy
equipment and instrumentation worth about US$20 :A would be let through ICB
procedures. Local manufacturers will be entitled to a preference of 15% or
prevailing customs duty, if lower, in the evaluation of bids. Tender docu-
ments will specify the requirements for preference eligibility and the manner
of its application. Light equipment and vehicles worth about US$8 M would be
procured through LCB procedures acceptable to IDA.  The equipment and vehicles



- 33 -
will be conveniently grouped to promote efficiency and attract competition;
however, awards will also be accepted on individual schedules to attract small
manufacturers. Because of existing servicing and spare parts supply facili-
ties, there are considerable benefits to be derived from procuring local
models of the items listed as light equipment and vehicles (see Volume III,
Annex 5 for detailed list of equipment, vehicles and instruments).
Disbursements
3.32      Disbursements would be made for:  (i) 100% of the foreign expendi-
tures for directly imported equipment; (ii) 100% for locally manufactured
goods procured ex-factory; (iii) 70% for other locally procured goods; (iv)
100% of foreign and 70% of local expenditures for operational improvements,
training, monitoring and evaluation; (v) 70% of expenditures for civil works
incurred up to March 31, 1983 and 50% thereafter; and (vi) 100% of eligible
expenditures for project preparation. Disbursements for force account work
and for payments of less than Rs 300,000 under civil works contracts and Rs
150,000 for equipment and vehicles would be made against certificates of
expenditure--itemized by sub-project--submitted by GOG. Documentation for
these works would be retained by GOG and made available for inspection by IDA
during review missions. Full documentation would be required for all other
disbursements. The estimated schedule of expenditure, the semi-annual dis-
bursement schedule and the proposed allocation of the proceeds of the credit
are presented in Tables T-11 to T-13. It is expected that disbursements would
be completed by June 1986.
Accounts and Audits
3.33      The Irrigation and Public Works Departments is subject to normal
Government control and auditing procedures are satisfactory. An agreement
was reached with GOG that:  (i) it would maintain separate accounts on
project expenditures (accounts would be maintained for each scheme);
(ii) these accounts would be audited by the State auditor; (iii) audit sum-
maries would be submitted to IDA within nine months from the end of each
fiscal year together with the auditor's reports; (iv) complete accounts and
financial statements would -be made available for inspection during IDA review
missions; and (v) disbursements against certificates of expenditure would in
addition be audited through internal auditors. An agreement was also reached
with GOI that the other states benefitting from the project preparation
facilities would maintain accounts and be audited in accordance with the same
procedures as agreed with GOG.
IV. IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATION
A. Project Implementation
Organizational Responsibilities
4.01      The Irrigation Department.  The direct responsibility for the
planning and implementation of the new major irrigation schemes and the main



- 34 -
civil works in the Saurashtra Coastal DevelopmenL Scheme would rest with the
Irrigation Department (ID). The ID, which has a sufficient staff of well-
trained engineers to meet the increased construction workload 1/ under the
credit, is organized, as shown in Chart C-2, into six branches, headed by
Chief Engineers (CE)--five of whom are also Joint Secretaries--who work under
the guidance of the Secretary, Irrigation: 2/
(a)  The Irrigation Projects (IP) Branch is responsible for
planning, design and construction of aLl medium and some
of the major projects in the State. The IP Branch would
be responsible for the Saurashtra scheme.
(b)  The Projects Branch was originally set up for the design and
construction of the IDA-financed Kadana Irrigation Project
(Credit No. 176-IN). Its responsibilities have now been
extended to cover selected major projects in central Gujarat,
including the Heran and Karjan schemes proposed for financ-
ing under the credit.
(c)  The Narmada Construction Branch is responsible for plan-
ning and construction of the Narmada Scheme.
(d)  The Narmada Planning Branch was establ:.shed for the plan-
ning and monitoring of the Narmada Scheme. It would be
responsible for the Narmada planning component of the pro-
posed project.
(e)  The Damanganga Branch is responsible for implementation
of the Damanganga scheme.
(d)  The Irrigation (I) Branch operates all major and medium
irrigation projects are present. It also assists the
distrizt Panchayats in the design and construction of
minor irrigation projects. The I Branch has planned and
started to implement the lTkai-Kakrapar modernization
scheme.
4.02      The ID's construction organization is ilexible and adjusted to the
implementation program. The main units are the construction circles. Each
circle is headed by a Superintending Engineer (SE) and handles a work program
of US$5-10 M annaally. All designs of canals ancl minor canal structures for
the circle are prepared by a design office direct:ly under the SE. Typically,
the circle consists of 4-6 divisions, headed by Executive Engineers (EEs),
1/   However, the staff is not sufficent to meet the increased requirements
for operating the system; the training institute to be financed under
the credit would train staff to meet this shortage.
2/   Until April 1979, ID was a wing of the Public Works Department (PWD).
The Secretary, Buildings and Communications retains certain administative
responsibilities for ID.



- 35 -
and about 25 sub-divisions. The divisions employed on major projects have
functional responsibilities, for example: canal surveys, masonry dam con-
struction or quality control. Testing of construction materials is carried
out by GOG's Engineering Research Institute (GERI).
4.03      The central support units report to the CE-IP.  The three Water
Resources Investigation Circles (WRI), headed by SEs, are responsible for
the hydrological, geological and soil surveys and the preliminary design of
all major and medium projects. In order to provide basic data for irrigation
planning purposes, they maintain a network of rainfall and river discharge
gauging stations and carry out in-depth studies of selected river basins
in the State. The Central Design Organization (CDO) with three SEs, prepares
detailed designs of earth and masonry dams and major canal structures. It
lays down design standards and provides typical designs for minor canals and
canal structures to the construction circles. The CDO has a special unit that
also assists the construction circles in computerized PERT planning for proj-
ect implementation. Model studies for the design of irrigation projects are
carried out by GERI in Vadodara or by GOI's Central Water and Power Research
Station in Pune, Maharashtra. In 1977, a Project Preparation and Monitoring
Cell (PPM), with a multidisciplinary staff was established in order to better
integrate agricultural development aspects in the planning of irrigation
projects. The ID's Mechanical Organization--with heavy construction
equipment--also reports to the CE-IP.
4.04      The Building and Communications Department (B&C).  It would survey,
plan, design, supervise construction and maintain the command area roads,
acting as sole executing agency and in close consultation with the CAD Admini-
strators. Overall control and liaison would be the responsibility of the
Chief Engineer and Joint Secretary PWD and would be operated through the
existing Roads Section of the Project Preparation and Monitoring Cell. This
section which is headed by an Officer on Special Duties (OSD) of SE grade,
would be strengthened so that the OSD would be supported by two EEs and four
Deputy Engineers. Two Command Area Roads Circles would be created to be
engaged exclusively on command area road works. To meet the implementation
targets, both these circles would be established at the beginning of GOG's
fiscal year 1980/81. In addition, two specialist Sub-Divisions would be
provided in each of the four commands, one being responsible for quality
control and one for maintenance of construction equipment. Back-up for these
two services would be provided by the B&C Quality Control Organization and
Mechanical Wing, respectively. The project would provide field testing equip-
ment for quality control and mobile maintenance units to undertake a regular
program of in spection and servicing of all equipment employed on the widely
scattered construction sites. In order to improve the operational efficiency
of road construction units, B&C would provide in-service training for engineers,
supervisors, technicians and plant operators employed on project works. The
organization of B&C is shown on Chart C-3.
4.05     CAD Authority. 1/  The GOG would appoint a special Project Manager
for implementation of the Ukai-Kakrapar modernization works. He would be
1/   See paras 4.14-4.16.



- 36 -
under the administrative contirol of the CAD Commissioner but he would, in
technical matters, report to the CE-I. He would be assisted by staff deputed
from the Irrigation and Agricuiltural Departments.  Three separate planning and
design cells (one each for the Karanj, Umbrath and Surat Modernization areas
and one for the coastal reclamation works) would be established. and staffed
with irrigation engineers, drainage specialists and agriculturalists.
An assistant project manager would be responsible for PERT planning and for
day-to-day monitoring and eva:Luation: there would be a continuous feed-back
from the field so that designs and construction methods can be modified based
on actual experience. An expert group of engineers and agricultural experts
would be established to advise on project implementation and to make a formal
mid-term evaluation of the design and construction aspects of the moderniza-
tion works. It is expected that in 1983 sufficient data would be available
for the mid-term review and for formulation of the second phase program.
4.06      The reclamation of c:oastal lands in Ukai-Kakrapar would be inte-
grated into the modernization works and be the rasponsibility of the project
manager. The irrigation, drainage and protectio-1 works would be planned and
implemented as described above. However, an OSD would be functioning as
assistant project manager for the agricultural development and settlement
aspects.  The GOG would appoint a committee or panel of experts to advise
on implementation plans and to monitor progress on the coastal land develop-
ment. The actual composition of the committee could be variable and flexible
but it should be small--consisting of three to five members selected from
Gujarat or throughout India. One member would come from the Central Soil
Salinity Research Institute in Karnal; others would be from agricultural
research institutions or from development projects where similar problems
have been overcome successfully, or be consultant:s with expertise in selected
fields. This committee would meet periodically (about once every six months)
to advise on problems and to monitor progress.
Implementation Programming (see Implementation Schedule - Chart C-1).
4.07      The New Major Schemes,  The credit would finance a five year time-
slice (approximately between April 1980 and 1985) of the three projects.
The construction program would complete the dams, main and brancha canals, the
road networks and a major part of the distributicin systems of the three projects.
The irrigation system (lined distributaries, minors, sub-minors and unlined
field channels from the 8 ha turnout to the fielks) and the drainage system
would be constructed simultaneously and completed on a block-by-block basis. 1/
The command area roads would also be completed or a block-by-block basis.
However, in order to facilitate the construction and reduce the cost of the
irrigation works, the roads would be completed, where necessary, in advance
of the other components. A coimmissioning period of at least two years would
follow the completion of each block of the irrigation system. During this
period, the Irrigation Department (ID) and the Command Area Development
Authority (CADA) would be jointly responsible for the system and required
1/   An irrigation block--typically 3,500-4,000 ba--consists of the distri-
bution system below the branch canals, as far as the government outlet,
and includes field drains and the channels between this outlet and the
individual farms.



- 37 -
adjustments to the system would be done by the ID. A special budgetary
provision would be made for this purpose. The subsequent commissioning
would verify that the design discharges could be delivered to all parts of
the block.
4.08      Ukai-Kakrapar Modernization.  Planning, design and construction of
the modernization works would be a continuous process programmed on the basis
of critical-path analysis. The objective of this analysis would be to imple-
ment the works in a timely fashion with minimum interruptions of irrigation
deliveries. Furthermore, there would be a continuous feed-back from the
field so that designs and construction methods can be modified based on
actual experience. The planning and design work would be carried out within
such a time frame that the canal closures would be notified at least one year
ahead to enable the farmers to make suitable adjustments in cropping patterns
and, eventually, arranging a supplementary water supply.
4.09      Construction Methods.  At present, canal and dam foundation excava-
tion and canal and road embankment construction are implemented mostly by
manual labor. Construction under the credit would continue to be labor-
intensive. However, because of the rapid urban development in Southern
Gujarat, significant migration of skilled construction workers to the Middle
East and the heavy labor demand from the Narmada scheme which is just starting,
it is expected that in the future an increasing share of the work tradition-
ally done manually, would be carried out by machinery. Under the credit, all
compaction of dams, canal and road embankments, paving of roads and some
excavation--especially for drains--and stone breaking operations would
be done with mechanical equipment. Large and medium sized contractors in
Gujarat typically own most equipment. However, heavy and specialized equip-
ment is usually owned by the ID and leased to the contractors. For work
where quality control and safety is especially important or quantities are
exceptionally difficult to estimate in advance, ID implements the work with
its own equipment.
4.10      Land Acquisition and Resettlement.  The construction of the three
major irrigation schemes 1/ would include the resettling of about 5,700
families from villages submerged by the reservoirs on to new sites selected
by the GOG.
Number of Villages      Cultivable Land
Affected            Submerged (ha)
Heran                 22                   3,620
Karjan                28                   2,560
Damanganga            36                   4,420
Total              86                  10,600
1/   The Ukai-Kakrapar Modernization and Saurashtra Coastal Development
Works would involve only limited acquisition of land and no submer-
gence of existing village sites.



- 38 -
4.11      The COG has a well developed policy for land acquisition, resettle-
ment and rehabilitation of families displaced by major irrigation schemes.
Full compensation is paid for land, houses and other immovable property.
New village sites with schools, public buildings, roads, water and electricity
supply are constructed by GOG. Transport of families to the new site with all
household belongings and whatever building materials can be recovered from the
old houses is provided by GOG. Furthermore, special resettlement grants are
given to the affected families.
4.12      However, the most important feature of GOG's land acquisition policy
is not the full compensation for property lost but the aim of rehabilitating
the displaced families by providing alternative means for their future live-
lihood. This is done though a variety of means: making cultivable land
available--each family is provided with new land equal to the amount acquired
by the GOG, however, if the original farm is smaller than 2.0 ha, the family
would be given at least 2.0 ha; providing credit at favorable terms; estab-
lishing dairy or fishing cooperatives; and vocational training. GOG's
resettlement plans for the Damanganga, Heran and Karjan schemes include not
only the standard provisions--i.e., new village infrastructure, allocation
of cultivable land, etc.--but also the provisio-n of irrigation facilities
where technically and economically feasible. This would be done either by
relocating the displaced families inside the comnmand of a surface irrigation
project or by providing irrigation wells or lift: irrigation schemes for the
new farms. In allocating irrigable land preference would be given to those
families from whom irrigated land has been acqu-:red. To facilitate the
rehabilitation of the displaced families, the GOG would appoint, for each
scheme area, a rehabilitation committee comprising representatives of the
resettled families, GOG officials from concerned departments and voluntary
agencies active in the areas. The resettlement work would be supervised
and coordinated by a Director of Rehabilitation in the ID. An agreement was
reached with GOG that as part of its resettlemert plans for the Damanganga,
Heran and Karjan schemes, it would allocate cultivable land to the displaced
families.
4.13      The protective, irrigation and drainage works in the tail-ends of
the Ukai-Kakrapar modernization area (paras 3.08-3.13) would cover both pri-
vately and publicly owned land. On-farm reclamation works on private land
would be contingent on agreements by the owners to finance these works. The
public land would be reclaimed through leaching and initial cultivation of
green manure followed by paddy. After it is fully reclaimed, the land would
be subdivided and settled. Settlers would be given 2 ha farms. Priority
would be given to people living in the area. Any family presently owning
less than 2 ha would be eligible to get land to bring their total holding up
to about 2 ha. However, lots of less than 0.5 ha would not be distributed.
People from reservoir submergence areas would be resettled--on a village-by-
village basis--in a limited part of the reclaime,l area. They would not be
integrated into existing villages but settled into new villages that would be
provided with all community facilites.



- 39 -
B. Irrigation System Development and Management
Command Area Development Authorities (CADA)
4.14      At present, the direct responsibility for operation and maintenance
of irrigation projects rests with the I Branch of the Irrigation Department
(para 4.01). The I Branch also constructs field channels in the Ukai-Kakrapar
project while the soil conservation wing of the Agricultural Department is
responsible for construction of field channels in most other irrigation
projects. In order to achieve an effective coordination between irrigation
management and agricultural supporting services and to assist the farmers to
carry out on-farm development, GOG has established three Command Area Develop-
ment Authorities (CADA); one for Mahi-Kadana, one for Ukai-Kakrapar and one for
a group of smaller schemes in Saurashtra and Northern Gujarat. Each CADA is
headed by an Area Development Commissioner (ADC) who reports to the Secretary,
Agri culture. However, the CADAs do not have any staff of their own and the
ADCs fulfill only loose coordinating functions. The parent departments (the
Agriculture and Irrigation Departments) retain full technical and partial
administrative control of their field units. The performance of these field
units is further hampered by the fact that there is no professional cadre of
trained and experienced water management specialists who can operate the
irrigation systems in full response to agricultural requirements or who can
properly advise farmers on land development and on-farm water management.
4.15      Under the proposed project, a separate CAD Wing for water manage-
ment would be established in the Agricultural Department. It would be
staffed with properly trained land and water development specialists. Al-
though initially the staff would be deputed to the CAD Wing, the objective
is to transform the Wing into a separate department for water management
with its own cadre of land and water management specialists. The GOG would
examine the feasibility of establishing such a separate CAD Department.
Over time, graduates from the water management and land development training
center (para 3.22) would fill up the cadre. Short term training would also
be provided for the deputed staff.
4.16      Special Circles would be established under existing CADAs for the
Damanganga, Heran and Karjan command areas. The CADAs would be responsible
for operation and maintenance of the projects; organizing the farmers to
establish (together with the extension service) rotational water allocation
schedules and advising farmers on land development and irrigation practices.
When sufficient trained staff would be available, the CADAs would also be
responsible for the survey, planning and design of the minor irrigation and
drainage works.
Water Allocation and Delivery
4.17      As noted in Volume II, present water allocation procedures do not
ensure an equitable and dependable irrigation supply to the individual farmers,
nor do they provide sufficient incentives for on-farm development. The
project would finance the introduction of RWS in a number of existing schemes
(para 3.23). From the start of irrigation in the new scheme areas, water
deliveries to the farmers would be on rotational basis in accordance with



- 40 -
predetermined schedules established for the rahi and hot weather season.
GOG would also examine how rotational deliveries can be introduced during the
kharif season when rainfall is subject to significant variations. Before the
start of each irrigation season every farmer under a distributary/minor would
be notified by CADA of his allocation for water for the forthcoming season
and the way the supply will be made available to him (rotational interval 1/).
The allocation would be based on: (i) the seasonal availability of water;
(ii) the cropping pattern and the calculated water demand for this pattern
for the minor/distributary under which he is located; (iii) the size of his
holding; and (iv) soil conditions. The farmer would have the right to refuse,
within a stipu:Lated time period, to use part or all of his allocation. Water
not utilized by a farmer would be reallocated first to farmers under the
same distributary/minor, but if they do not want to use it, to other farmers
in the command, In establishing the allocation, preference could be given to
small farmers.
4.18      Seasonal irrigation schedules would depend on the storage avail-
able in the reservoirs and would be established through fortnightly assess-
ments of scheme water requirements. These schedules would be based on
updated rainfall and streamflow records, measured conveyance and distribution
efficiencies and information feedback on actual cropping patterns in the
command area. In the new schemes, the reservoirs would be operated to provide
pre-monsoon irrigation for those kharif crops for which early planting is
beneficial.
Operation and Maintenance of Irrigation Systems
4.19     The irrigation and drainage networks wDuld be constructed by the ID
and handed over to the CADA for operation and malintenance (O&M). The basic
field operating unit would be a distributary coimmand block, covering about
3,000-5,000 ha and managed by a junior engineer, The block would be equipped
with the necessary communication and climatic data collection devices.  To
ensure that the irrigation schemes are completely functional from the outset,
the ID would commission each distributary block prior to handing it over to
the CADA. The commissioning would be carried ouit by the ID during a period of
24 months after completion of construction and would include repairs or recon-
struction to remedy any deficiencies in design and construction.  A similar
procedure would be used for the main and link drainage systems. To ensure
adequate operation and maintenance of the canal systems, annual O&M budgets
would be determined on the basis of a detailed operation and maintenance
program for each segment of the scheme works, and the canals would be closed
for maintenance for an appropriate period which would be determined and
adequately publicized each year at the beginning of June. An agreement was
reached with GOG that it would undertake periodic safety inspections of the
dams and spillways in accordance with sound engineering practices.
Road Maintenance
4.20     The B&C is directly responsible for maintenance of only the National
and State Highways in Gujarat. All other roads are maintained by Local
1/   The frequency and amounts of irrigation deliveries would be adjusted
to fit crol), soil and seasonal climatic conditions.



- 41 -
Authorities (Panchayats) which are controlled by elected bodies and whose
operations are funded partly from various State departmental budgets and
partly from local revenue. The Chief Engineer, B&C retains ultimate respon-
sibility for the construction and maintenance of road works undertaken by the
Panchayat Divisions, supervision being exercised through a Superintending
Engineer at State level. In some cases, this arrangement is rather tenuous as
it is very difficult to achieve effective technical control of a large number
of divisions, located throughout the State, which are under the administra-
tive and financial control of the semi-autonomous Panchayats. Consequently,
an agreement was reached with GOG that it would maintain all project roads as
well as all existing roads that form an integral part of the command area road
networks.
V. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND COST RECOVERY
A. Agricultural Production
5.01      Present agricultural production in the new scheme areas and along
the Saurashtra coastal plain reflects the uncertain rainfall. Average yields
are low and cropping intensities only around 100%. This climatic risk factor
is the principal constraint in the farmers' use of modern high yielding varie-
ties, which require relatively costly inputs of labor, seed, fertilizer and
chemicals. Existing minor irrigation facilities (wells, pumplifts), which are
dispersed throughout the scheme areas, have demonstrated that local farmers
quickly adopt profitable cropping patterns once an assured water supply is
available. A wide variety of crops including high yielding sorghum, fodder,
wheat, vegetables, flowers, fruit and sugarcane are grown under minor irriga-
tion. Under assured year-round canal irrigation, farmers can be expected to
adopt more profitable cropping patterns employing high yielding varieties, and
to move away from the present subsistence type agriculture. The introduction
of efficient farm irrigation and drainage practices, would, however, need
considerable inputs from developmental research and agricultural extension.
5.02      Agricultural production in the new scheme areas and along the
Saurashtra coast would increase through the adoption of more intensive crop-
ping patterns (Table T-14) through increased yields (Table T-15) and from
a switch from drought resistant to more water responsive crops. The Ukai-
Kakrapar modernization would result in reduced water losses, more reliable
irrigation supplies and improved drainage. As a result, the irrigated area
would expand and both rainfed and irrigated yields would increase. Expected
total incremental agricultural production at full development (about 10 years
after commencement of irrigation delivery in each block of the irrigation
schemes) is shown below for major crop categories; details of individual crop
production are shown in Table T-14.

development would be financed through institutional sources (refinanced by
ARDC). The 10-year repayment schedule includes a 2-year grace period.
Water and Water-Related Charges
5.05      At present, the prime vehicle for recovery of capital and O&M costs
for irrigation works is the water charge. GOG has a policy of reviewing and
revising the water charge every two or three years. Over the last decade, the
rates have increased about 2% annually in real terms, reflecting the increased

agricultural productivity. The present rates, together with the rates in
Maharashtra, are the highest in the country:
Crop                   Rate (Rs/ha)
Paddy                           106
Other Kharif Foodgrains         28
Groundnuts                      76
Other Kharif Foodcrops          48

Orchards                       693
Grass                           48
5.06      For the projected cropping pattern of the three major schemes, the
water rate would average about Rs 184 per cropped ha. A 20% local cess is
levied on the water rate, which would bring the total assessment up to about
Rs 220 per cropped ha or Rs 247 per ha of net CCA.
5.07      The Irrigation Act 1/ provides for the collection of a betterment
levy from farmers benefitting from irrigation works. According to the Act,
the betterment levy should be set at half the increase in land value due to
an individutal project (defined on a before-and-after basis). The repayment
period and the interest to be charged on the outstanding amount are set
through an executive order, published in the Official Gazette. However, the
assessment of the betterment levy has been successfully challenged in the
courts, and, as in most other States, the levy is not collected at present.
Other Agricultural Taxes
5.08      Since incomes in the agricultural sector are much lower than in the
manufacturing and service sectors, the rate of agricultural taxation is rela-
tively modest. The land revenue and associated cesses amount to about Rs 15-20
per ha. More important from a revenue point of view is the agricultural sales
tax which is levied--at a rate of 4%--on cotton and oilseeds. It is estimated
that GOG's revenues from the agricultural sales tax would increase on average
by about Rs 40 per ha in the three major irrigation schemes. Purchase tax on
sugarcane-at a rate of 6%--is another source of revenue.
Levels of Cost Recovery
5.09      If the water and water-related charges remain at their present
levels--in real terms--the GOG would recover about 27% of project cost from
the three major irrigation schemes:

Evaluation of GOG's Cost Recovery Policy
5.10      The adequacy of GOG's cost recovery po:icies should be evaluated in
terms of: (i) the usefulness of water charges to promote efficient use of
irrigation water; (ii) the need to generate public savings to sustain a high
level of investments in irrigation; and (iii) equity and the farmers' ability
to pay water charges.
5.11      Promoting Efficient Water Use.  In general, volumetric water rates
promote a more efficient water use than area-based water charges, but the
unlined distribution systems existing at present do not permit either a reli-
able irrigation supply nor an accurate measurement of the water supplied to
each farmer. The new technical standards for the distribution network and the
rotation water supply introduced under the credit. are specifically designed to
ensure that each farmer in the command areas recetives a predetermined volume
of water in a reliable fashion. Thus, it would be technically feasible to
charge the farmers on a volumetric basis. 1/
5.12      When the farmer is allocated a predetermined amount of water, he
tends to select his crops and his intensity of irrigation in such a way that
he optimizes his returns to water. In the absence of major distortions in the
price structure of major crops, this allocation system generally leads to an
efficient use of water. However, an area-based water charge provides an
incentive to use the water on a smaller area than that which is desirable from
society's point of view. Consequently, area based charges might adversely
1/   The volumetric measurement of water deliveries would be carried out at
this stage by measuring the time during which a fixed flow of water is
made available to the farmer at the chak outlet.



- 45 -
affect production if they are set at too high a level. Volumetric charges
would allow farmers to vary their crops and the irrigated area to maximize
the private and social returns to water irrespective of the level of water
charges. The introduction of a system of water charges based on water
quantities delivered is therefore of highest priority.
5.13      Public Savings.  Although the water and water-related charges are
relatively low and contribute little to the State's revenues, GOG is making
a strong effort in resource mobilization by other means. 1/ In recent years,
its tax revenue has increased by about 10% per year in real terms, and is
presently about Rs 130 per capita or roughly 50% above the national average.
Due to the difficulty of assessing and collecting taxes on the agricultural
sector and the relatively low incomes in the sector, GOG depends heavily on
indirect taxes on the non-agricultural sectors.
5.14      GOG would directly recover about 25% of project cost from the bene-
ficiaries. In addition, GOG would recover about 2% through sales and pur-
chase taxes on the incremental production resulting from the operation. This
would bring the cost recovery index up to 27% and imply that about 73% of
the costs are met from the Government budget. However, this over-estimates
the net impact on the budget since the increased farm incomes would lead to
further increases in GOG and GOI revenues through other indirect taxes. On
the basis of agricultural production and indirect taxes for the whole State
during 1960/61 to 1975/76, it is estimated that Rs 1.0 of value added in
agriculture would generate about Rs 0.04 in indirect taxes other than those
discussed earlier. Under the operation, the incremental value added would
amount to about Rs 6,200 per ha and GOG's incremental revenues from non-
agricultural taxes would be about Rs 250 per ha. 2/ Consequently, the net
contribution from GOG's budget would be no more than Rs 1,010 per ha or about
58% of the annual financial requirements.
5.15      Farmer's Ability to Pay Water Charges.  For the assessment of
farmers' ability to pay water charges, the "project rent" has been estimated.
The project rent is equal to net incremental farm income less the necessary
rewards to the farm family for its labor, entrepreneurship and cultivation
risk. The project rent has been analyzed for representative farm models in
each scheme (Table T-19). At full development the project rent is estimated
1/   For a review of GOG's finances see:  "Gujarat State Finances and
Planning for Irrigation and Agriculture", by Roger Grawe, December
1977.
2/   It should be noted that this represents only part of GOI's and GOG's
incremental revenue resulting from the operation. The reason is that
increased agricultural incomes would generate growth in the non-
agricultural sectors of the State's economy and the implicit taxation
on these sectors are significantly higher than on agriculture. Thus,
the total cost recovery from the direct and indirect benefits of the
operation would be considerably higher.



- 46 -
to average about Rs 2,660 per ha. Thus if the water rates remain unchanged the
rent recovery index for the project would be 18'. However, in the past, the
water rates have been increased in real terms to reflect the increased benefits
from irrigation. This trend is likely to continue in the future. Given the
expected large increases in incomes as a result of the construction of the
schemes, there would appear to be scope for subsequent increases in the water-
related charges.
5.16      However, there are large variations nct only in the benefits accruing
from different projects but also between different farmers in the same scheme.
In view of the difficulties of assessing the benefits to each individual farmer,
the general policy in India is to charge a uniform water rate. It has been
observed in the older projects, that the water supply to most tailend farmers
is highly unreliable and that their benefits from "irrigation" are fairly
low. This is well illustrated by estimates of farm budgets in Ukai-Kakrapar
(Table T-17).
5.17      Consequently, water rates have to be set at a low level in order to
give the tailend farmers sufficient incentive to use irrigation water, even
though the "average" farmer would be able to pay substantially higher charges.
Because of the low charges, the "average" irrigated farmer makes a significant
profit which is taxed only to a limited extent. Both from an equity point of
view and from a resource mobilization point of view it would be desirable to
have a system of water charges that are directly related to the benefits
accuring t6 each farmer. Therefore, without voluimetric charges, that better
reflect the benefits of irrigation, the water charges will generally have to
remain at a relatively low level.
5.18      Conclusion.  The technical standards introduced under the project
are specifically designed to ensure that each farmer in the command area
receives a reliable water supply. Consequently, it would be technically
feasible to collect water charges based on volumetric measurements of the
water delivered. The cost per actually irrigated hectare of command area
would be lower 1! than in existing projects, while at the same time the bene-
fits to the individual farmer would be higher and more secure.  Efficiency
considerations imply that the introduction of a charge related to the volume
of water delivered is of the highest priority. Consequently, an agreement was
reached with GOG that, by December 31, 1981, it would review the water and
water-related charges in the State; and that, based on the outcome of the
review and after paying due regard to IDA's comments, it would begin to exper-
iment with different systems of volumetric charges to promote efficient water
use by the consumers. By December 31, 1984, GOG would have evaluated the
experience from these experiments and, if the experience is favorable, would
start implementing a volumetric system of charges in all the scheme areas.
These charges would recover the annual O&M costs and, to the extent possible,
the cost of the irrigation infrastructure. In establishing the level of
charges, due consideration would be given to farmers' incentives and payment
capacity and to the overall budgetary requirements of the State. The study
1/   However, the cost per hectare of command area would be higher than in
existing systems.

would be based on a careful evaluation of the benefits accruing from the
higher design standards and the rotational water supply introduced under the
project.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION 1/
General
6.01     The proposed investment would lead to completion of three on-going
major irrigation schemes, modernization of Ukai-Kakrapar (Gujarat's largest
irrigation scheme), increased irrigation potential for coastal areas in
Saurashtra and would assure operational and management improvements. It
would increase the production of foodgrains, cotton, sugarcane, fruit and
other crops, and generate additional and more stable employment opportunities
for landless laborers and small farmers.
6.02     The overall impact in terms of agricultural production, employment
generated and of farm families benefitting at completion at full development
is summarized below:
1/   The assumptions regarding yields, prices, input requirements and the
derived crop and farm budgets and economic benefits are given in
Appendix 2 and Tables T-16 to 22.

Employments Effects
6.03     The provision of new and the improvement of existing irrigation
schemes would have strong emloyment generation effects. The irrigation schemes
together would increase family employment by about 3.2 M mandays which is
equivalent to the creation of about 10,000 full-time jobs. More important
from an equity point of view would be the creation of about 21,000 full-time
jobs for non-family labor. The latter would consist largely of landless
laborers, from the area and migrants from outside.
6.04     With an increase in value added in agriculture of some Rs 1,900 M,
the operation would generate additional income and employment in local non-
farm sectors such as marketing, transport and processing. On the basis of
district level data on value added in agriculture and non-farm employment in
the State of Karnataka in 1970/71, 1/ (with adjustments for inflation between
1970/71 and 1979/80), the increase in non-farm employment is expected to be
of the order of 58,000 manyears. Thus, the operation would substantially
decrease the high level of unemployment and under-employment in the scheme
areas and help to stem rural-urban drift.

Income Effects
6.05      Low, poorly-distributed and variable rainfall is the major constraint
facing farmers in Gujarat. Once this constraint is released, substantial
income gains are possible. In the three major schemes, the average net
increment in farm incomes is estimated at about 215%. The estimated income
effects are:

6.07      Income levels of landless laborers in the scheme areas are generally
lower than the incomes of small farmers. The effects of the project on the
incomes of landless laborers are difficult to forecast, but a survey in the
Tungabhadra command area 1/ of Karnataka revealed that as a result of irriga-
tion, the average days worked annually by landless laborers increased from
about 130 to 230 days. With an increase in hired labor demand of 5.6 M man-
days, the operation would almost double the average income of some 50,000
landless laborers in the project areas.
Economic Evaluation
6.08      The assumptions used for the economic evaluation are detailed in
Appendix 2. Appropriate conversion factors have been applied to all costs and
benefits to make them comparable at world market prices. The cost and benefit
streams have been discounted over a 50-year period (30 years in the case of
Ukai-Kakrapar Modernization Scheme). The overall economic rate of return
(ERR) is estimated at 18%. The ERR and the net present values for the
project individual components are as follows:

Sensitivity Analysis and Project Risk
6.09      The results of sensitivity analyses inclicated that only large (and
unlikely) deviations from the project assumptions would cause the various

components not to be economically viable. The relative output prices would
have to decline by one-third, future with project yields by one-fifth, or the
construction cost would have to increase by at least 60%. With the exception
of Ukai-Kakrapar, the ERRs are relatively insensitive to construction delays
or to a slower buildup of agricultural benefits (see Table T-23).
6.10      However, the sensitivity analysis did highlight the critical impor-
tance of careful scheduling of the Ukai-Kakrapar modernization works. Any
prolonged closure of the canal system would result in lost agricultural pro-
duction. Assuming that the canal system--inside a distributary block--would
be closed for 6 months each construction year, the ERR would be related to
the construction period in the following manner:
Years of
Construction    ERR
1          27%
2          20%
4          12%
6           8%
6.11      In Ukai-Kakrapar, the modernization works would be carried out on a
distributary-by-distributary basis and, thus, the closures would be limited
in time. However, from an economic point of view, one 6-month closure period
would have cost equivalent to 70% of the basic civil works cost. Thus, in
order to avoid two 6-month closure periods, it would be appropriate to spend
as much as an additional 140% on civil works to provide an alternative source
of water during the construction period. 1/.
Environmental Effects
6.12      The main water-related diseases in Gujarat are malaria and typhoid.
The construction of drainage facilities and the lining of canals in the new
schemes would minimize areas of stagnating water which are suitable breeding
grounds for mosquitoes. Also, borrow-pits excavated in the course of project
implementation would be drained. Under these conditions, it is not expected
that the incidence of malaria and typhoid would increase due to the construc-
tion of the new schemes. The modernization and drainage works would signif-
icantly reduce waterlogging and drainage problems in the Ukai-Kakrapar area.
The Saurashtra coastal development works would improve the groundwater quality
in the area. Thus, the overall environmental effects of the new schemes would
be positive. However, an agreement would be reached with GOG that it would take
all necessary measures to minimize the hazards of malaria and other water-
related diseases in areas covered by the credit.
1/   No attempts have been made in this analysis to assess the effects of
closing a major part of a scheme to make improvements on a main canal.
However, the results discussed above indicatet that in schemes with a
large percentage of the area under hot weather and perennial crops, the
cost of closing down a whole or major part of the system could exceed the
potential benefits that might result from improvement works on main canals.

INDIA
GUJARAT IRRIGATION II PROJECT
Criteria for New Projects 1/
1.   Planning Process
(a) Planning of irrigation projects would be a continuous process
into which there is a systematic feedback of experience. To
make this possible, a continuous monitoring and evaluation
program is required to feed back information to the planners
from current experience on the construction and operation of
the project under implementation and from other projects. For
this purpose, the project preparation and monitoring cells would
be suitably strengthened; and
(b) A systematic experimental and research program would be under-
taken so that fully developed and evaluated technologies are
available when the time is ripe to introduce them. This means
that research has to be started today on technologies that will
be needed and ready for introduction 10-15 years from now.
Provision for this would be made under the Project.
2.   Project Preparation
(a) A continued upgrading of existing procedures for collecting
hydrological data from rivers feeding the project, including
the continual collection and evaluation of monthly flow records
and the use of computerized reservoir operation studies;
(b) Systematic classification of the command area for irrigability
(on the basis of detailed topographical, soil and drainage
surveys, etc); and
(c) Preparation of periodic reviews (i.e., at approximately five
year intervals) to highlight socio-economic changes in the
project areas (e.g., labor and farm power availability) which
influence cropping patterns and water demand.
3.   Design Standards
(a) Increased professional manpower made available for the survey,
planning and design of the minor distribution system;
(b) Appropriate large-scale survey work to permit proper align-
ment of minor conveyance channels and outlets;
1/   Partly, these criteria codify existing practices in Gujarat.



56
Appendix 1
Page 2
(c) Design of the required number of cross regulators in the
main and distributary canals allowing the network to be
operated efficiently at two-thirds of design depth.
(d)  Lining of the entire conveyance system from the dam intake
down to irrigation turnouts that serve approximately 8 ha
blocks. 1/ (Implied in this criterion is the objective that
no field should be further away from a lined channel than
300 m.) The lining would be of high quality as to reduce
conveyance losses and maintenance;
(e) A piped distribution system (from minors down) would be pro-
vided wherever sufficient natural head is available unless
it is economically not viable. Turnouts from this system
would typically serve 8 ha blocks;
(f) The minor distribution system would be planned "from the
tail-up". Thus the alignment of minors an:id sub-minors would be
decided first after a tentative layout oF the field channels
has been prepared;
(g) Chak sizes should be based on topography, soils, cropping
patterns and farm sizes, but would in general not exceed
20 ha. For operational purposes, the chaks would be
broken up in 8 ha sub-chaks each served by a gated turn-
out;
(h) Measuring devices (such as standing wave flumes and V-notch
weirs) would be provided throughout the system down to the
Government outlet;
(i)  Service roads would be provided along all channels with a
capacity above 50 cusecs and all weather bicycle/motorcyle
paths along all minors;
(j) A master plan of the drainage system would be prepared
together with the irrigation system and in coastal areas
drains would be provided with tidal regulators; and
(k) A modern communication system would be provided in the
catchment area (for flood control purposes) and at various
control points on the canal, the dam and the divisional
headquarters.
1/   The Damanganga project area has high rainfall and heavy soils.  Since
ample water would be available in the river, the lining would be
extended by down to the 20 ha level. However, the turnouts would
serve 8 ha blocks. Furthermore, distributaries, with a capacity
between 10 cusecs and 100 cusecs, would be lined selectively depending
upon the estimated seepage losses from unlined channels.



57
Appendix 1
Page 3
4.   Construction Standards
(a) The irrigation system (lined distributaries, minors, sub-
minors and unlined field channels from the 8 ha turnout to
the farm-gate), and the drainage system and road networks
would be constructed simultaneously by the Government and
completed on a block-by-block basis; where necessary to fac-
ilitate the irrigation and drainage works the road network
would be constructed in advance of the other components;
(b) A commissioning period of at least two years would be intro-
duced. During this period required adjustments to the system
would be done and a special budgetary provision would be
made for this purpose. The commissioning would be on a
block-by-block basis;
(c) The organization for monitoring implementation performance
(both in quality and quantity terms) would be suitably
strengthened at both project and Sachivalaya level; and
(d) An existing dam review panel composed of specialists in
engineering geology, flood hydrology, dam design and con-
struction, would be maintained during project implementation.
This'panel would meet periodically as required, but not less
than once in 12 months, to review and evaluate all data and
design and construction practices, and make specific recom-
mendations to GOG concerning: embankment safety; foundation
and abutment integrity; and spillway capacity.
5.   Operational Procedures
(a) Water deliveries to the farmers would be on rotational basis
in accordance with predetermined schedules established for
the rabi and hot weather season. GOG would examine how rota-
tional deliveries can be introduced during the kharif season
when rainfall is subject to significant variations;
(b) Before the start of each irrigation season, every farmer under
a distributary/minor would be notified by CADA of his allo-
cation for water for the forthcoming season and the way the
supply will be made available to him (rotational interval).
The allocation would be based on: (i) the seasonal availability
of water; (ii) the cropping pattern and the calculated water
demand for this pattern for the minor/distributary under which
he is located; (iii) the size of his holding; and (iv) soil
conditions. The farmer would have the right to refuse, within
a stipulated time period, to use part or all of his allocation.
Water not utilized by a farmer would be reallocated first to
farmers under the same distributary/minor, but if they do not
want to use it, to other farmers in the command. In estab-
lishing the allocation, preference could be given to small
farmers;



58
Appendix 1
Page 4
(c) Seasonal irrigation schedules would depend on the storage
available in the reservoirs and would be established through
fortnightly assessments of project water requirements. These
schedules would be based on updated rainfall and streamflow
records, measured conveyance and distribution efficiencies
and information feedback on actual cropping patterns in the
command area;
(d) Irrigation water for kharif crops, for which early planting is
beneficial, would be available at the beginning of June and
the project reservoirs would be operat(ed to provide appropriate
carryover storage for pre-monsoon irrigation;
(e)  The canals would be closed for maintenance for an appropriate
period which would be determined and publicized each year at
the beginning of June;
(f) Annual O&M budgets would be determined on the basis of a
detailed operation and maintenance program for each segment
of the schemes; and
(g) The method of assessing water charges would be revised to
promot,s the use of kharif irrigation.
6.   Organizational Changes
(a) A separate CAD Wing for water management would be established
in the Agricultural Department. It would be staffed with
properly trained land and water development specialists.
Although initially the staff would be deputed to the CAD
Wing, the objective is to transform the Wing into a separate
department for water management with its own cadre of land
and water management specialists. The GOG would examine the
feasib:Llity of establishing such a separate CAD Department; and
(b) Special Circles would be established under existing CADAs for
the Damanganga, Heran and Karjan command areas. The CADAs
would be responsible for operation and maintenance of the
projects; organizing the farmers to establish (together with
the extension service) rotational water allocation schedules
and advising farmers on land development and irrigation
practices. When sufficient trained staff would be available,
the CADAs would also be responsible for the survey, planning
and design of the minor irrigation and drainage works.

GUJARAT IRRIGATION II PROJECT
Economic Analysis
General
1.        The economic prices of major traded agricultural outputs and in-
puts are derived from the IBRD projected 1990 world market prices expressed
in 1979 currency value with appropriate adjustments for freight, handling
and processing. The projected economic prices for non-traded foodgrains,
on the other hand, are derived by applying a foodgrain conversion factor to
the financial prices of various crops are projected on the basis of their
historical price trends. Present and projected financial and economic
prices are given in Table T-20. The cost and benefit streams are given
in Table T-21. The detailed assumptions behind the estimates are described
below.
Official Exchange Rate (OER)
2.        Until September 24, 1975, the Rupee was officially valued at a
fixed Pound Sterling rate. since then it has been fixed against a "basket"
of currencies. As these currencies are floating, the US dollar/Rupee ex-
change is subject to change. Conversions of financial prices have been made
at US$1 to Rs 8.40, which represents the projected exchange rate over the
disbursement period of the credit.
Standard Conversion Factor (SCF)
3.        The benefits of the operation are evaluated at world market prices,
i.e. they measure what India would have to pay for imports or receive for
exports.  Most of the costs, however, are for items that are not traded
on the world market. Tariffs and trade restrictions introduce a distortion
in the price relationship between traded goods - valued at world market
prices - and non-traded goods - valued at local prices. Thus, the costs
are not directly comparable with the benefits. In order to make them com-
parable, an SCF is applied to the price of non-traded goods and consumption.
In the absence of trade restrictions, the SCF can be approximately calculated
using the formula:



60
Appendix 2
Page 2
X + N
SCF  =  X   S    M   T   1/
x        m
For the period since 1970, this calculation gives an SCF of 0.86. However,
since this estimate does not take into consideration quantitatite restric-
tions, it provides only an upper limit for the SCF. The Indian Planning
Commission recommends for the evaluation of industrial projects the use of
conversion factors for foreign exchange and for untraded goods that impli-
citly give a SCF of about 0.75. Because of the approximate nature of this
estimate, a SCF of 0.8 has been used in the economic analysis.
Prices of Agricultural Outputs
4.        The economic prices for traded goods such as rice, wheat, cotton,
groundnuts and sugarcane are based on their border prices at the official
exchange rate (OER). The domestic cost component:s (i.e. local transport
and marketing charges) are adjusted by the SCF of 0.80. The economic prices
for non-traded foodgrains (sorghum, maize and pulses are assumed to be
non-traded) are derived by applying a foodgrain conversion factor (FCF) to
the financial price. The FCF can be estimated with the following formula:
FCF  =  (Q rice x PE rice) + (Q wheat x PE wheat)
(Q rice x PE rice) + (Q wheat x PF wheat)
Q:      Gujarat production
PE:     Economic price
PF:     Financial price
The projected financial prices for various crops are based on the estimated
historical price trends in Gujarat and India.
Prices of Agricultural Inputs
5.        Fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides are potentially traded
commodities; to make allowance for taxes and subsidies and the total cost of
transport and marketing, a conversion factor of 0.95 has been applied to the
financial price. The financial price of bullocks and miscellaneous charges
has been multiplied by the SCF to express them in economic terms. Analyses
of farm labor supply and demand in various Indian irrigation projects typic-
ally give an economic shadow wage rate for farm labor in the range of 1/2 to
2/3 of the average financial wage rate. For the analysis of this project a
shadow wage rate of 67% of the market wage has been assumed.
1/   X = fob value of exports at the official exchange rate (OER); M = cif
value of imports at OET; S = export subsidies; T = import duties.



61
Appendix 2
Page 3
Construction Conversion Factor (CCF)
6.        The schemes would be constructed using a mixture of equipment,
skilled and unskilled labor. For the economic analysis, the CCF is estimated
as follows:
(a)  Traded Component - This component includes capital-intensive
works which require imported materials. Since it is traded,
the conversion factor is 1.00. It is estimated that about
15% of the construction costs fall under this category.
(b)  Non-Traded Component - This component includes works that
require skilled labor and locally manufactured materials.
The SCF of 0.80 is used as the conversion factor for these
works. About 30% of the construction costs are included
in this category.
(c)  Unskilled Labor - A minimum wage is in force in Gujarat.
Since daily worker virtually never are paid above the
minimum wage, it is likely that this wage is higher than
the wage at which the workers would be willing to work
(i.e. their supply price). Civil works construction is
harder physical work than farming, and experience from
similar areas in India indicates that the laborers require
a premium of 25%-30% to shift from agriculture to construc-
tion work. By comparison with agricultural wages in the
State, it is estimated that the construction laborers'
supply price is about 15% to 20% below the minimum wage.
This gives a shadow wage factor which is 10%-20% below
the SCF, or approximately equal to 0.67. It is estimated
that unskilled labor constitutes about 55% of the con-
struction cost.
Conversion Factor
Traded Items                           1.00
Non-traded Items                       0.80
Unskilled Labor                        0.67
Construction Costs
(weighted average)                    0.75
Land Acquisition and Resettlement Costs
7.        Costs of the operation include the cost of resettling families
from villages submerged by the reservoirs. The economic cost of resettle-
ment is calculated by multiplying the financial cost by the construction
conversion factor (CCF). Where the cost of land acquisition is concerned,
the real cost to society is the opportunity cost, that is, the production
foregone by the submersion of the land in the reservoirs and the loss of
lands acquired for the construction of the distribution system. The per
ha value of production in the future "without project" situation was taken
to represent this opportunity cost and deducted from the benefit stream.

Economic Rate of Return and Net Present Value
8.        The economic cost of all civil works, equipment, land acquisition,
administration and engineering, operation and maintenance costs have been
included in the derivation of the ERR. Discounting costs and benefits over
a 50 year period, the estimated rate of return and the net present value of
10% and 12% interest rate for each scheme at full development are as follows:
Net Present Value
Rs M
ERR           10%        12%
Heran                  17%           293        162
Karjan                 21%            696       441
Damanganga             16%           298        147
Ukai-Kakrapar /a       20%              4.9       3.3
Saurashtra             18%            68         18
Whole Project          18%         1,610        940
/a 1000 ha development block with cost and benefits
discounted over 30 years.
Sensitivity and Risk Analysis
9.        Several tests were performed to determine the sensitivity of assump-
tions made in the economic analysis (see Table T-23). The sensitivity of ERR
to changes in output prices and yields is moderate. A decrease of more than
20 per cent in either of these variables in the major schemes would lower the
ERR below that of the opportunity cost of capital. The sensitivity to in-
creases in construction cost is very low, however, that is the case only under
the assumption of no construction delays. Construction delays, a frequent
occurrence in Indian irrigation projects, would slow down agricultural devel-
opment in scheme areas.
10.       The existing analysis did highlight the critical importance of
careful scheduling of the Ukai-Kakrapar modernization works. Any prolonged
closure of the.canal system would result in lost agricultural production.
Assuming that the canal system -- inside a distributory block -- would be
closed for six months each construction year, the ERR would be related to
the construction period in the following manner:
Years of Cana:L
Closure                     ERR
1                       27%
2                       20%
4                        12%
6                        8%



63
Appendix 2
Page 5
11.       Since the modernization works will be done on a distributory-by-
distributory basis, the closures will be limited in time. According to the
analysis, one six-month closure period would have "cost" equivalent of 70% of
the basic civil works cost, i.e. it would be appropriate to spend as much as
an additional 140% on civil works to provide an alternative source of water
during the construction period.
12.       No attempts have been made in this analysis to assess the effects
of closing a major part of a scheme to make improvements on a main canal.
However, the results discussed above indicate that in schemes with a large
percentage of the area under hot weather and perennial crops, the "cost"
of closing down a whole or major part of the system could far exceed the
potential benefits that might result from improvement works on main canals.
Estimates of Benefits for the Saurashtra Coastal Development Scheme
13.       The value of water at plant was estimated for the Saurashtra coastal
irrigation schemes to quantify scheme benefits. The estimates were conducted
by using two independent methods:
Method 1: estimates of net incremental return per ha and crop water
requirements per ha for a typical cropping pattern in the area was
used to estimate the value of one cubic meter of water (see Table
T-22). The resulting weighted average return per one m is Rs 0.62.
Method 2: yield of groundnuts, a predominant crop in the area
was estimated as a function of effective rainfall. District
data on rainfed yields and monsoon rainfall (MR) for the
period 1972-76 were adjusted for trend growth up to year 1978/79
with the resulting equation:
Yield = -52.1 + 1865.9 MR - 587.0 MR2
Using daily rainfall data for two stations in Saurashtra over
five years, the effective rainfall (ER) was estimated in accor-
dance with the "Potential Evapotranspiration/Precipitation
Ratio Method." 1/ Subsequently, ER was expressed as a function
of MR through regression analysis. The resulting relationship
was:
ER  =  7.763 x MR
The yield of groundnuts was then derived as a function of effective rainfall by
merging the two equations (see Chart in Table T-22).  Whe resulting marginal
value of water at plant was estimated at Rs 0.63 per m of water.

Appendix 2
Page 6
14.       The palue of water at the plant was furth3r adjusted to give the
valuS of one m at the pumping station. From one m pumped from the resirvoir
65 m would be available for surface irrigation at plant, from the .35 m
remaining in the aquifer .2 mr would be utilized for irrigation from wells.
In recharge of one m of groundwater .76 would be available at plant, i.e.
.152 from the reservoir as could be seen overleaf from a flow chart:
one m  of water-        -4 0.65 available at plant through surface irrigation
at reservoir
in aquifer ' -  2 groundwater 'z---i.152 available at plant
recharge       >
.15 lost                .048 lost
Adjusted for losses in the Irrigation system, the benefits of one m3 at pump
station are then estimated at about Rs 0.49.
15.       The total storage capacity of regulators and bandharas in the
Saurashtra Coastal Devilopment Scheme is estimated at about 80.8 Mm3. The
total inflow of 2023Mm corrected for losses due to evaporation and percola-
tion gives 130.9 Mm of water available for irrigation, i.e, the value of water
is estimated at about Rs 64.14 M at full development.
16.       Since the water supply situation for bandharas and regulators is
similar, direct comparison is possible. 3Weighting the capital cost of all
schemes gives an average of Rs 2.0 per m of water storage available. The
weighted average of capital cost of regulators and bandharas and the O&M cost
for pumps and distribution systems were adjusted for economic analysis. Dis-
counting the weighted average of cost and benefits over a 50 year period the
ERR is 18% (Table T-22).

1/ Some studies of farmers' behavior show that a simple approach can be adopted to take into account the farmers' risk aversion by estimating a certainty equivalent value (CE) of the
expected value (EV). The formula used is:
CE = EV - n x s
where s = the standard deviation and n = a factor that expresses the farmers' risk aversion. The studies indicate that the farmers' choice of cropping patterns and production
techniques can be predicted for values of "n" in the interval 1 to 2 and that "n" decreases when the farm size increases. For this analysis, it is assumed that n = 2 for a 0.5 ha
farm and n = 1.5 for the 3.0 ha farm in mainland Gujarat and n = I for the 5 ha and 8 ha farm models. The variation in historical gross returns under rainfed conditions are
roughly within 205, of the average values in mainland Gujarat and 30% in Saurashtra. It has been assumed that under "with project" conditions, the gross returns would vary within
10'0 of the average values.
2/ The reward for management and entrepreneurship is primarily a premium for the special skills that farm management requires. Consequently, it has been assumed that the "management
fee" is equal to 10% of the net returns.
