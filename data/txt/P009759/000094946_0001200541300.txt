GUJARAT IRRIGATION II PROJECT
Staff Appraisal Report
VOLUME II - SECTOR REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This volume gives an overview of Gujarat's irrigation sector.  It
is the second comprehensive review that the Bank has undertaken 1/ of a
State's existing irrigation project and its future program, with the objec-
tive of identifying improvements in the planning, design, construction, oper-
ation and utilization of these investments. The study also provides a frame-
work within which to evaluate the extent and scope of the Bank's involvement
in a State's irrigation program: in this State, the Bank Group is already
financing the Gujarat Irrigation Project (Credit No. 808-IN), and, with the
proposed project 2/, would be involved at all levels of Gujarat's irrigation
program. General issues of national policy, however--e.g., land tenure,
agricultural prices, subsidies and credit--are outside the scope of the study.
1.02      The experience from Bank-financed projects in other States indicates
that the findings and conclusions reached during these sector reviews are
applicable to most irrigation projects in the semi-arid zones of India. The
low yields and especially the "underutilization" of irrigation potential have
been major concerns of the Government of India (GOI) and the States. Numerous
studies and committees have dealt with the problem. 3/ In an attempt to
remedy the situation, command area development (CAD) programs, focussing pri-
marily on development below the government outlet--i.e., on the construction
of field channels, drains and land shaping--have been initiated in most irri-
gation projects. It has become increasingly clear, however, that the lack of
1/   For the first sector review, see Maharashtra Irrigation II Project,
Volume II, IBRD, Report No. 2529a-IN, September 13, 1979.
2/   The proposed project would consist of financing a five-year time slice
of Gujarat's irrigation program. The components of the project would
be three new major schemes (Damanganga, Heran and Karjan); partial
modernization of the State's largest irrigation scheme (Ukai-Kakrapar);
development of parts of the Saurashtra coast, where groundwater is af-
fected by saltwater intrusion from the sea; and various items of techni-
cal assistance. For details, see Volume I of this report.
3/   See for example the Report of the Irrigation Commission, Ministry of
Irrigation and Power, New Delhi, 1972; and the Report of the Working
Group on Irrigation (Major and Medium Irrigation Program, 1978-83), GOI,
Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, Department of Irrigation, New
Delhi, January 1979.

on-farm development is only a partial explanation for the low yields and
underutilization; and that the major constraints to higher yields and expan-
sion of the irrigated areas are found between the dam and the government out-
let.
1.03      Project design, water allocation and canal operation procedures
have changed little since the nineteenth century, when the prime objective of
irrigation was to provide insurance against droughts and famines. As a re-
sult, most existing projects cannot provide a timely and reliable water sup-
ply at the farm gate which is a prerequisite for productive, high value
agriculture. Because the water supply is unreliable, on-farm development
is resisted by the farmers and has only a limited impact on the performance
of agriculture in the command areas. CAD works and improvements in irriga-
tion infrastructure and project management are, thus, complementary and rein-
force each other.
1.04      The recommendations in this review are made within the context of
GOI's and the Government of Gujarat's (GOG) development objectives: the pursuit
of economic growth with a redistribution of incomes and wealth. Agricultural
development is perceived as a means of achieving both these goals, given that:
"...in a predominantly rural economy the key to alleviating poverty
is to accelerate the growth of agricultural incomes...Extending the
benefits of irrigation to additional areas and optimising utilization
will play an important role in promoting agricultural development...
A substantial stepping up) of the utilization of the irrigation
potential created already, has to be obtained." 2/
Further, agricultural growth and the expansion of irrigation facilities are
the key to the removal of unemployment and significant underemployment, through
direct effects on the agricultural sector and through indirect effects on the
non-agricultural sector.
1.05      Growth.  The development of irrigation facilities has been a major
factor in the growth and stabilization of agricultural productivity in Gujarat,
both through an increase in the cropping intensi:y, and through a rapid growth
in irrigated yields. Because of Gujarat's erratic rainfall, reducing the impact
of drought is an important, though not unique, benefit of irrigation. The
agricultural sector still accounts for about 40% of the State's income, and
provides employment directly to about 65% of the labor force -- and indirectly
to a significant proportion of the non-agricultural population, through the
development of agro-based industries and the mult:iplier effect on the State's

economy. Thus any growth in the agricultural sector will tend to raise output
and employment in the economy as a whole. The improvements in planning, design,
construction, implementation and operation of irrigation systems to be intro-
duced under the credit 1/ are designed to improve the utilization of irrigation
investments, and thus their potential contribution to the growth of the economy.
1.06      Gujarat's agriculture has long been oriented towards cash crops,
especially cotton and groundnuts. However, in recent years there has been a
rapid increase in the production of high-value fruit, vegetables and spices,
crops for which there is buoyant demand generated by the growing urban popula-
tion of the industrial belt between Ahmedabad and Bombay. A reliable supply
of these high-value cash crops would also form the basis of an expanding food-
processing industry, which would help alleviate Gujarat's non-agricultural
unemployment problem. As most of Gujarat's fastest growing industries are
highly capital-intensive, further concentration of investment in such indus-
tries will aggravate both income and employment inequalities.
1.07      Distribution.  As well as providing general distributional benefits
through the development of agriculture, the proposed irrigation investments
are also likely to result in more specific inter-regional and inter-farmer
income redistribution. The three new major schemes and the modernization
component are all located in the poorest and most backward areas of the State.
The small farmers and landless laborers will benefit through increased produc-
tivity of the land, the former through direct income increases, and the latter
through increased employment opportunities.
1.08      However, just as serious as the inter-regional imbalances are the
inter-farmer inequalities, which have in many cases been exacerbated by the
introduction of irrigation. The improvements in planning, design, construction,
implementation and operation to be introduced under the proposed credit would
help prevent -- and in the old schemes, redress -- the present deficiencies
which allow the farmers at the head of the system to take water at the expense
of those at the tail-end.
1.09      In conclusion, Gujarat's agriculture is tending increasingly away
from subsistence crops and towards cash crops: wherever reliable irrigation
is available, there has been a rapid expansion of the area under fruit, vege-
tables and spices. This is particularly true of Southern Gujarat -- where
most components of the proposed project are located -- because the soils are
suitable and demand is strong in the nearby industrial belt. Irrigation
investments in this area are thus a key element in Gujarat's development
strategy, not only in terms of the growth and employment they are likely to
generate, but also in terms of their income redistributional effect, and of
their positive impact on regional balance.

II. THE STATE OF GUJARkT
General
2.01      The State of Gujarat, covering an area of 19.6 M ha, has a popula-
tion of about 32.0 M (1979). By most indicators it is one of the more advanced
States of India. It is fairly urbanized and has a large modern manufacturing
sector. However, agriculture has a predominant influence on the State's eco-
nomy and continuous economic progress is largely dependent on the removal of
constraints to further agricultural growth, particularly through the expan-
sion of irrigation.
The Economy - Recent Trends
2.02      Although Gujarat's economy is still dominated by the agricultural
sector, by Indian standards iit is relatively industrialized. The following
table summarizes the present structure and recent growth trends of the
economy:

/b   Adjusted to exclude the extreme drought years of 1972/73 and
1974/75; the inclusion of these excepticnally low values distorts
the regression results.
2.03      In Gujarat, the agricultural sector accounts for about 36% of net
domestic product, a relatively small share, compared with 44% in the national
economy. As a corollary, the share of the secondary sector (mining, manufac-
turing, construction, etc.) is relatively large at nearly 30%, compared with
the all-India average of 23%. The shares of the other sectors in Gujarat are
similar to those of the whole country.



- 5 -
2.04      Over the period i960/61-1977/78, both the Gujarat and Inojan
economies experienced a similar overall growth rate, at 3.5% p.a., but with
a different sectoral distribution, and different per capita growth rates.
Due to Gujarat's rapid population growth rate, per capita incomes almost
stagnated, increasing at only 0.7% p.a., compared with a national growth rate
of 1.1% p.a.  At the national level, the agricultural sector, which grew at
only 2.3%, proved a major constraint on the growth of the whole economy, while
all other sectors were particularly dynamic--notably transport, communication,
trade, hotels, etc., which grew at nearly 5% p.a.. The growth of Gujarat's
non-agricultural sectors was less marked, partly because they started from a
higher base than those in the Indian economy.
2.05      The relative stagnation of the secondary sector in Gujarat
(mining, manufacturing, construction, etc.) can be related principally to
the sluggish performance of the textile industry. In 1961/62, this industry
accounted for 66% of the value added in the industrial sector, but by 1976/77
its share had declined to 34%:

The poor performance of Gujarat's textile industry was the result of factors
at the national level such as weak demand, price controls, and policies to
protect the handloom sector that had a corresponding effect on the textile
industry throughout India: between 1951 and 1975, national industrial produc-
tion of textiles grew at only 1.4% p.a.
2.06      In absolute terms, the fastest growing sectors of Gujarat's economy
have been mineral production, especially of petroleum products, and manufac-
turing of chemicals, whose share in the industrial sector increased from 12%
to 21% in the period since 1961/62. However, these industries are highly
capital-intensive and have few linkages with the rest of the State's economy.
Thus, they have not increased consumer incomes significantly and they have
largely failed to generate growth in other sectors. Manufacturing of machinery
has more than quadrupled since 1960/61, but it started from a low base and,
currently, it accounts for only 8% of value added in manufacturing. The
dynamic growth of this sub-sector, which was fueled by the expanding demand
for irrigation pumps and engines, illustrates the strong linkages that exist
between agriculture and other sectors of the economy. Another example of the
entrepreneurship for which the Gujarates are famous is the rapid growth of
India's export-oriented diamond cutting industry which is based in Surat
district. In spite of the impressive expansion of many manufacturing sub-

-6-
sectors, the dominant size of the textile industry has meant that the overall
growth of the manufacturing sector has been welL below the all-India average.
The sluggish performance of manufacturing has in turn affected transport,
trade and services, which have grown relatively slowly.
Emplment
2.07      The labor force cornstitutes 31% of the total population.  Its parti-
cipation rate among the tribal population is significantly higher (over 40%)
than for the population at large. About 67% of the labor force is employed
in agriculture and allied activities with cultivators and agricultural laborers
accounting for 43% and 22%, respectively. Thus, about one-third of the agricul-
tural workers are landless.  Most of these landLess laborers are concentrated
in the southern coastal areas where they constitute approximately half of the
agricultural labor force.

As productivity and incomes in the agricultural sector are among the lowest
in the economy, any increases in agricultural productivity will have major
income distributional benefits, as well as providing a stimulus to the non-
agricultural sectors.
2.08      While the secondary sector (here defined as mining, manufacturing,
construction, etc.) accounts for nearly 30% of State Domestic Product (SDP),
it employs only 14% of the labor force. Industrial employment is heavily
concentrated in the agro-based industries: over 60% of industrial workers are
employed in the food, drink and tobacco, textiles, wood, paper and leather
groups. Nearly half of all industrial workers are employed in the textile
industry.

At present, the fastest growing industries--chemicals and minerals--are also
among the most capital-intensive. If non-agricultural employment is to grow
even at the same rate as the urban population, then the more labor-intensive
industries, such as food, drink and tobacco, wood, paper, leather, etc. will
have to expand rapidly. Between 1960 and 1969, employment grew between 15%
and 20% p.a. in the following industries: dairy products; canning and pre-
servation of fruits and vegetables; grain mill products; bakery products.
These growth rates were exceeded only in electrical machinery, bicycles and
jewelry. 1/ If Gujarat's agricultural production--particularly of the high-
value crops--grows rapidly, then the incentive for investing in the former
group of industries is likely to be strong on both the demand and the supply
side. On the supply side, the timely and reliable provision of cheap inputs--
such as cotton, mangoes, and fish for canning, dairy products, tobacco,
leather, etc.--are likely to be as important as the existence of a strong
market. Markets for the output of these industries are likely to be buoyant
in Ahmedabad, Surat, Bombay, the rest of India and even the Middle-East.
2.09      However, even if labor-intensive industries expand rapidly, they
are unlikely to grow sufficiently within the next 20 to 30 years to absorb the
current un- and under-employment in the rural sector, let alone the expected
increase in the population of working age. For the foreseeable future, then,
the principal source of increased employment opportunities for the rural popu-
lation will have to come from the agricultural sector, where more than two-
thirds of the labor force are currently employed. Most of this increase will
come from the intensification of agriculture through irrigation, which would
also require significant amounts of labor in the construction phase.
2.10      Agricultural development will thus play a central role in the devel-
opment of the whole economy over the coming decades, as the major potential
source of increased incomes and employment for the majority of Gujarat's popu-
lation; as a source of inputs for the agro-based industries which form an impor-
tant part of Gujarat's industrial sector; and as the generator of increased de-
mand for the output of all non-agricultural sectors of the economy.

Socio-Economic Conditions
2.11      Population.  Gujarat has one of the highest birth rates in India
and its 32.0 M population is increasing by about 2.6% per year. With about
30% of its population living in towns and cities, it is, next to Maharasthra
and Tamil Nadu, the third most urbanized of the States. Although the three
largest cities--Ahmedabad (population about 2 M), Surat and Vadodara--are all
located on the Gujarat mainland, the Saurashtra peninsula, with an extensive
network of small and medium sized towns, is the most urbanized part of the
State.
2.12      About 21% of the population belongs to traditionally disadvantaged
groups; scheduled tribes (14%) and scheduled castes (7%). The tribal popula-
tion is heavily concentrated in the "backward" rural areas of the eastern hill
region--where the new major schemes are located--while the people of scheduled
castes are widely dispersed throughout the State. A relatively high participa-
tion rate for women is characteristic of tribal agriculture, and the practices
are still fairly primitive: limited use is made of implements, fertilizers,
pesticides or improved seeds, and even shifting cultivation is still practiced
in a small area. Special prc,grams 1/ have been initiated for accelerating the
pace of development of these "backward" areas. Provisions for these programs
amount to 3.6% of the 1979/80 budget.
2.13      Rural Incomes.  Rural areas of Gujarai: are characterized by a rela-
tively equ'al distribution of income. 2/ In a normal year, about 40% of the
rural population have incomes below the poverty line (US$75). However, there
are large regional variations in the incidence of poverty. These income
differences (see Table T-4 for a detailed breakdown) can be explained largely
by ecological factors and the historic evolution of agriculture in the State.
A significant variable in explaining variations in household expenditure is the
cropping, or irrigation intensity of the village. 3/
2.14      The southern and central parts of the mainland, with high rainfall
and relatively fertile soils are densely populat:ed with small farms and a
large proportion of landless households. Kutch and Saurashtra, with low and

unreliable rainfall and less fertile soils, have traditionally not been able
to support a large population, which is clearly reflected in the farm size
distribution for the State (para 2.15). With the advent of irrigation and
modern farming practices, some of the low rainfall areas' natural disadvan-
tages have been removed. These factors and the concentration of tribal people
in the eastern hill region and the many small farms and large number of land-
less laborers in the southern coastal plains largely determine the regional
distribution of poverty in Gujarat (1970/71):

2.15      Another determinant of regional variations in living standards, but
less significant than the village cropping intensity, is the variation in farm
sizes. Farms in the low rainfall areas are significantly larger than in high
rainfall areas: (see Table T-3 for a regional breakdown).

2.16      Tenancy legislation, giving tenants ownership rights to the land
they previously rented, has been strictly enforced in Gujarat. Depending
on the type of tenancy, the land has been transferred to the tenants either
with or without payment to the former owners. Tenants have either paid for
the land in installments or have taken loans for this purpose from GOG or
land development banks. According to the 1970 Agricultural Census, 97% of
all holdings were fully owned; 2% were partly owned and partly rented; and
1% wholly rented.

from their school. Primary school enrollment is 60% above the national average
and the literacy rate (36% in 1971) is one of the highest in India. However,
the drop-out rate is high, and secondary school enrollment is only half of the
national average.
2.18       In rural areas, the number of doctors and health centers per 1,000
persons is significantly above the national average. The provision of safe
drinking water is a serious problem in this drought prone State, where the
groundwater is unreliable and often saline: GOG estimates that only about
one-third of the 18,300 villages in the State have an adequate supply. The
most severely affected districts are Panchmahals, Vadodara, Junagadh, Kutch,
Kheda and Rajkot. However, COG is increasing its efforts, and plans to sup-
ply most villages with a reliable water supply by the end of the current five
year plan.
2.19       Transport.  While the State is well-connected by railroads and air-
routes, its road network has lagged behind compared with other States: Gujarat
ranks fifteenth in terms of road length per hundred square kilometers and per
thousand of population. Out of 18,300 inhabited villages, only 6,200 have
all-weather communications and 5,200 have fair-weather roads. The inadequate
road network has acted as a constraint to a more rapid agricultural development.
However, over 95% of the population lives within 3 km of a bus route.
2.20       Power.  Progress in rural electrification has improved in the last
few years and about 44% of the villages (8,100 out of 18,300) and 156,000 pump
sets are now connected.  But (Jujarat still lags behind many other States:  in
Tamil Nadu and Haryana, for instance, all villages have electricity, although
the per capita consumption of electricity is about 20% lower than in Gujarat.
This is largely a reflection cof the capital-and ?ower-intensive development
of the manufacturing sector that Gujarat has adopted in recent years.  GOG
plans to electrify almost all remaining villages by the end of the current
five year plan.
III.  THE AGRICULTURAL SECTORt
General
3.01       Gujarat's erratic rainfall imposes a severe constraint on its rainfed
agriculture: yields of most crops are below the national average. However,
they have increased faster than in most other parts of India, largely as a
result of improved varieties and farming practices. An important characteristic
of the cropping pattern is the relatively small proportion of the sown area
under foodgrains--it has declined from 47% in 1960/61 to 44% in 1978/79, com-
pared with a national average of 73% in 1977/78--and the relatively high and
increasing proportion of the area under high-value cash crops. In value terms,
this factor more than offsets the low yields, so that the value of production
per agricultural worker is the fourth highest in India.
3.02       A factor which will 4affect the future of agricultural development
in Gujarat is the rapid growth of the urban population; as urban incomes tend



- 11 -
to be higher and to rise faster than agricultural incomes, so the demand for
higher value food crops--such as fruit and vegetables, sugar, spices and con-
diments, dairy products, poultry, eggs and groundnut oil--is likely to increase
more rapidly than the demand for foodgrains over the next few decades, Wherever
irrigation is available, the more perishable crops, such as fruit and vegetables,
are likely to be heavily concentrated around the urban growth centers, or close
to a major road. As a response to the demand generated by the industrial strip
between Ahmedabad and Surat, the central and southern parts of the State are
likely to be transformed over the next few decades into areas with concentrated
belts of market gardening and mixed farming.
Climate
3.03      Gujarat has a tropical monsoon climate with temperatures that are
suitable for gear-round cropping. Dailg minimum and maximum temperatures
range from 13  - 27  C in January to 27  - 41 C in May.  Annual rainfall
ranges from less than 300 mm in the Northwest to over 2,000 mm in a small
area in the Southeast, with most parts of the State receiving 500-800 mm.
About 95% of the rainfall occurs during the June-September monsoon. However,
variations in the timing and quantity are great, and in more than 60% of the
State, the rainfall is very unreliable (i.e. the coefficient of variability
is over 40% 1/).
3.04      The low and uncertain rainfall, combined with limited irrigation
facilities, has made Gujarat susceptible to droughts and famines. The latest
drought years were in 1972/73 and 1974/75 when foodgrain production fell 50%
below its normal level. Especially hard hit were rice and groundnut growers
who, on the average, lost two-thirds and three-quarters of their crop, respec-
tively. In large parts of the State, there was complete crop failure which
led to severe malnutrition in spite of sizeable famine relief expenditures
(about US$100 M following each of the two droughts). Although these droughts
were more severe than any other during the last two decades, drought in Gujarat
is a regular occurance: since 1900 the State has experienced severe food
scarcity not less than 25 times -- averaging once in about every 3 years.
Topography and Soils
3.05      The State divides naturally into three geographical units:  the
Gujarat mainland, the Saurashtra peninsula, and Kutch. Mainland Gujarat com-
prises extensive alluvial plains flanked by hilly terrain in the east. The
land slopes gently towards the west and southwest and is traversed by the
State's four major rivers (Tapi, Narmada, Mahi and Sabarmati) and numerous
small streams. At frequent intervals, the major rivers cause widespread
floods in the coastal areas. Due to the low gradient, natural drainage is
inadequate in the northern and central-western part of the mainland; asso-
ciated with the poor drainage are water-logging and salinity. Most of the
1/   This criterion was adopted by the Irrigation Commission (1972); the
coefficient of variability equals the standard deviation divided
by the mean.



- 12 -
southern mainland has deep black soils. The central mainland has sandy loam
soils in the western part and medium deep black soils in the eastern part.
The soils of the northern mailand range from sandy alluvium in the hilly areas
along the Rajasthan border to sandy loam at lower elevations. Coastal allu-
vium dominates along the Gulf of Khambhat.
3.06      The central part of the Saurashtra perninsula is elevated and the
land slopes very gently towards the coast and the plains of the Gujarat
mainland. Most of the rivers originate in this central table land and run
radially into the sea. The central portion of the peninsula is characterized
by low hills of coarse and shallow residual soils, underlain by porous disin--
tegrated rock, alternating with deeper clay loam or clay alluvial basins.
Along the Gulf of Khambhat and the Arabian Sea, coastal alluvium predominates,
while the soils along the Gulf of Kutch are sandy alluvium. In the coastal
areas, the water table is shallow and some localized areas of salinity and
high boron content occur. In recent years, over-exploitation of groundwater
has resulted in an increasing problem of salt water intrusion along the sou-
thern coast.
3.07      The Kutch land mass is crescent shaped, sloping towards the Great
Rann in the north and the Little Rann and the Bay of Kutch to the south.
The soils are generally derived from sandstones and limestones and are coarse
in texture with satisfactory .internal drainage. Large areas are affected by
salinity arnd the Great and the Little Rann of Kutch are, without reclamation,
unsuitable for agricultural production.
Land Use
3.08      About 9.8 M ha (52% of the reporting area 1/ in the State) is under
cultivation. The forest area is only 1.6 M ha (3%) and cannot be reduced
further without disturbing the ecological balance. About 3.8 M (20%) are
either barren, uncultivable, or put to non-agricultural uses.  Officially,
cultivable waste land accounts for 2.2 M ha (12%), but most of this land is
located in Kutch and has--without irrigation--ex-remely low production poten-
tial. 2/ The remaining 1.4 M ha (8%) are either fallow or used as permanent
pastures and grazing land. Thus, in practice, there is little scope for in-
creasing the net cultivated area except through reclamation of desert, saline
and ravine areas.
3.09      The cropping intensity (107%) is one oif the lowest in India.
However, this figure gives a somewhat misleading picture of the intensity of
land use, since almost one-fifth of the area is cultivated with two seasonal
or perennial crops. Given the low rainfall, the intensity of cultivation
1/   Land use is reported for an area of 18.8 M ha while the official estimate
of the State's area is 19.6 M ha. Water bodies account for a part of the
difference between the two estimates, but the difference is mainly due to
incomplete coverage of the land use surveys.
2/   Before 1970, about 1.4 M ha of cultivable waste land in Kutch was classi-
fied as uncultivable.

cannot be significantly increased without irrigation. Further increases in
agricultural incomes are primarily dependent on (i) continued yield increases
in rainfed areas; (ii) expansion of irrigation; and (iii) shifts in the crop-
ping pattern to higher value crops.
Crops and Cropping Patterns (Tables T-5 to T-9)
3.10      There are three cropping seasons in Gujarat:  kharif (June-October),
rabi (October-February), and hot weather (March-June). Most of the cropping
takes place during kharif, utilizing the monsoon rainfall. In rabi, crops are
grown on residual soil moisture or with irrigation. Except in limited areas
with perennial irrigation, no cultivation is done during the hot weather
season.
3.11      The climate and soils are suitable for cotton, groundnuts and
tobacco, and Gujarat produces about one-quarter of India's cotton and ground-
nuts and one-third of its tobacco. The area under tobacco (90,000 ha) is
small, but groundnuts and cotton are the most widely grown crops in the
State, accounting for about 1.9 M ha (or one-sixth of the cropped area) and
1.8 M ha, respectively.
3.12      Foodgrains--primarily pearl millet (1.5 M ha), sorghum (1.0 M ha),
wheat (0.7 M ha), paddy (0.5 M ha) and maize (0.3 M ha) and pulses (0.4 M ha)--
account for less than half the cropped area. As a result, Gujarat is seriously
deficient in foodgrains; in a normal year, production is about 4.3 M tons,
compared to estimated requirements 1/ of 5.7 M tons.
3.13      Pearl millet is the most important foodgrain, accounting for 30-35%
of total production. It is grown as a rainfed kharif crop throughout the
State, but is of lesser importance in the southern part. Since Independence,
yields have increased at an annual rate of 5.4% largely as a result of success-
ful research. Hybrid varieties were introduced in the mid-1960s and, at
present, two-thirds of the area is covered by these varieties. However,
since only 9% of the crop is irrigated, the average yield remains relatively
low (0.8 tons/ha).
3.14      Sorghum is grown as a food and fodder crop throughout the State.
The kharif crop is almost without exception rainfed and the rabi crop is
mostly grown on residual soil moisture. Short-duration HYVs are available,
but because of their relatively poor fodder value, they are rarely used.
Grain yields are extremely poor (0.4 tons/ha).
3.15      Wheat is the most popular rabi crop.  High yielding varieties were
introduced in 1967 and production has increased rapidly (8% p.a.). About
two-thirds of this increase was due to improved yields and one-third due to
expansion of the wheat area. One-third of the crop is grown on residual

(ii) seed requirements and storage and transport losses amounting to
10% of production.

soil moisture, especially in Ahmedabad and Kheda districts. Irrigated wheat,
which is grown throughout the State, yields close to 2.5 tons/ha compared to
0.7 tons/ha for the unirrigated crop. Wheat and coarse grains are the staple
food of the Gujarates.
3.16       Irrigated paddy (accounting for one-third of the rice area) is
usually transplanted and gives an average yield of about 2.5 tons/ha. The
rainfed paddy, with a yield of about 1.3 tons/ha 1/, is usually drilled. High
yielding varieties are primarily grown under irrigation. Since paddy requires
much more water than upland crops, paddy cultivation is concentrated in the
southern part of the State, where soils and climate are favorable.
3.17      Maize is grown in the eastern hill areas where it forms and important
component of the tribal diet. Like other kharif foodgrains, it is rarely
irrigated. However, hybrid varieties are gaining in popularity and now account
for one-fifth of the area. The average rainfed yield (1.1 tons/ha) is higher
for maize than for any other foodgrain in the State.
3.18      Cotton is grown primtarily in the central and northern parts of the
mainland and in the northern part of Saurashtra. Quality has received more
emphasis in cotton than in other crops; in the 1970s, short staple cotton
contributed nearly two-thirds of the total production while it now accounts
for less than one-fifth of the crop. Gujarat produces over 50% of India's
medium, 30% of its long, and 60% of its extra-long staple cotton. Since
Independence, the area of irrigated cotton has increased twenty-fold, but
still less than one-quarter of the cropped area is irrigated. Over this
period, yields have increased at an average rate of 2.3% p.a. mainly due to
the expansion of the irrigated area. Research emphasis has been on yields and
quality, but little attention has been paid to the development of short dura-
tion varieties for double cropping.
3.19      Groundnuts are grown primarily at Saurashtra under rainfed condi-
tions. The yield is highly influenced by the rainfall; in the drought year
of 1972/73, the average yield was only 0.20 tons/ha while it reached 1.24
tons/ha three years later. It is also affected by a number of diseases.
which makes it a risky crop. The production of other oilseeds (especially
castor) increased rapidly during the 1970s, primarily because of increasing
yields, but also due to acreages expansion.
3.20      Tobacco is concentrated in a small area in Central Gujarat with
favorable climate and soils. Since it is a high value cash crop, cultivation
practices are well advanced and about half the crop is irrigated. Since the
early 1960s, yields have increased rapidly (by 4.6% p.a.) and are presently
about 1.5 tons/ha. The quality is low and the tobacco is primarily used
for local cigarettes.
3.21      Sugarcane is the most important perennial crop grown under irriga-
tion (58,000 ha). About half of this acreage is located in the command area
1/   Equivalent to about 0.8 tons/ha of milled rice.

of the Ukai-Kakrapar project. In this, and neighboring areas in Surat and
Valsad districts, the processing system is well developed. However, both
yields (about 60 tons/ha) and sugar recovery (about 9.7%) are low and have
remained stagnant since the early 1960s.
3.22      Other Cash Crops.  With a large urban population in the State and
easy access to Bombay market, the market prospects for fruits and vegetables
are excellent. Mangoes are the principal fruit crop, grown primarily under
rainfed conditions in the southern-most district of Valsad and, to a lesser
extent with irrigation, along the Saurashtra coast. The second most important
crop is banana, which is grown mainly with irrigation in Surat district.
Vegetable production is also concentrated in the coastal areas of the Gujarat
mainland. The main exception is potato, which has its principal area of pro-
duction in the Banaskantha district. Other vegetables include onions,
tomatoes, cauliflower, brinjal, ladies fingers and cabbage. Statistics
on area, yield and production of most fruit and vegetables are virtually
non-existent. 1/ However, based on fragmented revenue data on cropped areas,
distribution of planting materials and turn-over in major markets, it appears
that the production of fruit and vegetables increased at a rate of at least
5% p.a. and possibly as much as 10% p.a. Most spectacular is the 19% annual
growth rate for potato production since 1960/61, largely due to the introduc-
tion of improved seeds and expansion of cold storage facilities.
3.23      Livestock and Dairying is an important feature of Gujarat's agri-
culture.   In 1974/75, the number of female buffalo, which provide most of the
State's milk, was 2.1 M. Much of the stimulus for Gujarat's dairy industry has
been supplied by the Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producer's Union (Amul),
which comprises 794 primary societies, with a total of 235,000 members. It
processes some 600,000 liters of milk per day, largely for supply to Bombay,
and its dairy products are sold nationwide. Amul has been a powerful force in
modernizing the dairy industry; it maintains 580 artificial insemination cen-
ters, popularizes green fodder cultivation and operates a cattle feed com-
pounding factory. Its economic impact is illustrated by a recent socio-
economic survey 2/ which showed that 56% of the incomes of farm households in
the Kaira District are derived from dairying. The success of Amul is being
spread over the State and, presently, there is a well established network of
some 2,000 dairy cooperatives organized into 12 district unions.
3.24      The number of poultry and pigs increased very rapidly between 1972
and 1977, at an annual rate of 23.4% and 3.3%, respectively. Poultry breeding
farms have been established and GOG is planning to institute a State eggs
marketing federation.
1/   Fruit and vegetables appear to account for about 8% of total agricultural
production and about 20% of the value of the output from irrigated areas.
Since these crops are likely to increase in importance in the future, the
lack of reliable statistics on the cultivation of fruits and vegetables
is a serious impediment to agricultural development planning.

Agricultural Production Trends (Tables T-7 to T-9)
3.25      The early years after Indenpendence were characterized by a rapid
acreage expansion; between 1950/51 and 1955/56, the cropped area increased
from 8.5 M ha to 9.5 M ha. Cotton accounted for half of this increase, fol-
lowed by groundnuts, wheat and pearl millet. In the period up to the mid-
1960s, the cropped area expanded much more slowly (by 0.6 M ha).  However,
there were significant changes in the cropping pattern. The groundnut area
more than doubled, to somewhat over 2.0 M ha; this expansion took place
largely at the expense of the area under foodgrains (especially millets).
An increase in the yields of most crops was comnbined with an expansion of
the cultivated area and a shift towards high-value cash crops. As a result,
between 1952/53 and 1964/65, the value of agricultural production grew faster
in Gujarat than in any other State.
3.26      Two factors changed the agricultural scene in the mid-1960s:  (i)
the potential for an expansion of the net cultivated area had largely been
exhausted; and (ii) high yielding varieties (HY'Vs) for a number of foodgrains
were introduced on a large scale (Table T-5). Most spectacular was the almost
tripling of wheat production between 1965/66 ar.d 1978/79. About two-thirds of
this increase was due to yield increases and one-third due to expansion of the
area under wheat. Similarly, the yields of the other major cereals increased
rapidly, but the cropped area declined; thus, the output of other cereals
grew at an annual rate of about 3% compared to about 7.7% for wheat. However,
much of the transformation that was associated with the "green revolution"
took place between 1965/66 and 1971/72.
3.27      Largely because of favorable weather, all the indicators of agri-
cultural performance--area, yield and production--reached a peak in 1971/72,
a level which they only just regained in 1978/79. Fertilizer consumption
(Table T-6) increased very rapidly from 1960/61, at a rate of 18.3% p.a.; it
doubled between 1965/66 and 1970/71, and again 'etween 1970/71 and 1978/79,
in spite of the drastic price increases and supply problems over the 1974/75
period. The use of modern vaLrieties of pearl millet, paddy and especially
wheat has spread quickly since 1971/72, but after an initial spurt, the use of
cotton HYVs has shown a recent decline. The area irrigated from groundwater
has grown very slowly compared to the rapid expansion of the 1960s.
3.28      There are a number of explanations for this mixed performance:  (i)
the weather--1972/73 and 1974/75 were extreme drought years and 1973/74 had
less than normal rainfall; (ii) the declining cotton yields and area sown; 1/
(iii) increased costs of fuel affected the profitability of well irrigation;
(iv) fertilizer prices were drastically raised in 1975/76; and (v) rapid
changes in output prices--foodgrain prices boomed during 1973 and 1974, fell
during 1975 and 1976 and rose again slightly in 1977 and 1978. Groundnut and
1/   Cotton is such a dominant crop in Gujarat's cropping pattern, that any
major change in the cotton performance also affects total agricultural
production. The decline in yields was probably caused partly by disease
and partly by a change in varieties.



- 17 -
cotton prices also declined in 1975 but increased in 1976 and 1977. The com-
bination of changing absolute and relative prices made crop planning extremely
difficult for the farmers. The perceived risks of droughts and falling prices
reduced the incentive for private farm investments.
3.29      However, the impact of the weather tends to obscure the underlying
trends in Gujarat's agricultural development. Furthermore, the picture is
distorted by the lack of production statistics for high-value cash crops such
as fruits and vegetables. Thus, to get a correct picture of agricultural pro-
gress during the 1970s adn the prospects for future growth, it is necessary to
look at some more basic "progress indicators": after a set-back during the
early 1970s, fertilizer use is again accelerating and the consumption in 1978/79
was double that in 1970/71. The use of modern varieties is increasing, and as
a result, the four major cereals all reached record yield levels in 1977/78 or
1978/79. The use of HYV cotton has shown a decline but the production of
potato and castor, which are non-traditional crops, has increased more than
five-fold over the last decade. The area irrigated from groundnuts has grown
very slowly compared to the rapid expansion of the 1960s.
3.30      The decline in private groundwater development is due partly to
the factors discussed in para 3.28, but also to the fact that the limit
of available groundwater is being reached in some of the most important ground-
water areas. Since private groundwater development appears to have been the
major contributing factor to the increase in gross cropped area during the
1960s and accounted for at least one-third of the productivity increase during
the same period, it is clear that the lost momentum in groundwater development
is a major cause of the relative stagnation of agricultural production during
the 1970s. This indicates that a rapid expansion of irrigation facilities is
a preprequisite for sustained agricultural development in Gujarat.
3.31      Even though the stagnation of recent years can largely be explained
by a combination of unfavorable exogenous factors, it is likely that the easy
benefits of the "green revolution" have already been reaped. To regain the
momentum, GOG's present plans give emphasis to:
(a) strengthening the agricultural supporting services;
(b) strengthening agricultural research, with special focus on
drought and pest resistant HYVs;
(c) developing improved dry farming techniques, with special
emphasis on methods of soil moisture retention, and expan-
sion of the soil conservation program;
(d) encouraging shifts in the cropping pattern to higher value
crops, for example, replacing groundnuts with soybeans and
hybrid castor;
(e) expanding the canal irrigated area and accelerating the
pace of modernization on existing projects, including
drainage of the water-logged areas, and conjunctive use
of surface and groundwater;



- 18 -
(f) controlling salt-water intrusion alont the Saurashtra
coastline.
3.32      Given the past success of agricultural research in the State and the
well-educated and progressive farmers, the pros3ects for a sustained growth
rate of agricultural production are favorable even without the Narmada develop-
ment. However, with the Narniada project, Gujarat is faced with the opportunity,
not only of stabilizing and maintaining a growth of production in physical
terms, but also of significantly increasing the value of its agricultural
output through a shift in the cropping pattern towards high-value crops.
Future Crops and Their Demand on the Irrigation System (Annex 1)
3.33      Design standards for the few existing large-scale irrigation projects
in Gujarat (para 4.11) evolved largely during the nineteenth century when the
prime objective of irrigation was to provide "drought insurance" to extensive
areas of foodgrains. Over time, cropping patterns and crop varieties have
changed and, as a result, existing projects cannot provide the timely and
reliable water supply that is the prerequisite for profitable cultivation of
high yielding, high value crops. Projects designed and constructed today
will reach their full maturity some twenty years in the future. Consequently,
the standards used for the planning and design c,f new projects must be raised
to meet not only the requirements of presently grown crops, but also--as far
as possible--the likely requirements of future crops. Although it is impossi-
ble to forecast accurately the future irrigated cropping patterns, crop
varieties, and the resulting demands on the irrigation systems, enough informa-
tion is available for a broad assessment of the direction of change. In
general, the factors that determine the future requirements on the irrigation
system can be divided into two groups:  (i) factors determining the cropping
pattern; and (ii) the characteristics of future crop varieties. Market pros-
pects and the suitability of the soils are prominent among the factors in the
first group; date of planning, timing of irrigations and crop duration are
important factors in the second.
3.34      Future market prospects are determined by a variety of socio-economic
factors such as:
(a) Rural/urban consumption patterns;
(b)  The proportion of rural/urban population and the shift
in the distribution over time;
(c)  The growth and distribution of incomes; and
(d)  The elasticity of demand for various products.
The interaction of these factors is incomplete, and different studies make
different projections of the growth of demand fo:P various products; but they
provide a relatively consistent basis for the following ranking of the crops:



- 19 -
Growth of Demand                  Crops
High                    Vegetable oil, fruits, vegetables,
condiments and spices, pulses,
dairy products, eggs and fish
Moderately High         Wheat, sugar, cotton
Intermediate            Rice
Low                     Sorghum, millets and other coarse
grains
On the supply side, the crops' response to irrigation, their genetic potential
and the comparative advantages among the States in the production of different
crops, all influence the irrigated cropping pattern in Gujarat.
3.35      As evidenced by high yields, Gujarat's climate and soils give it a
comparative advantage in the cultivation of cotton, tobacco, fruit and vege-
tables, condiments and spices. These crops, with groundnuts, already account
for at least one-third of the State's agricultural output in value terms, and
this share is likely to increase in the future. As one of the most industrial-
ized and urbanized of the States, and with a fast-growing urban population,
Gujarat as the advantage of rapidly expanding markets close to its most produc-
tive agricultural areas. Ahmedabad, Surat and the industrializing belt between
them; the well-developed transport network in this particular belt; and the
relatively advanced marketing and storage facilities all provide strong incen-
tives for the production of these high-value, high-income elasticity crops,
many of which (such as fruit, vegetables and milk) are perishable.
3.36      The following changes are likely to occur in the future in Gujarat:
(a) high value cash crops will become more important and coarse
grains less important;
(b) the cropping pattern will become more complex;
(c) most future varieties will be of shorter duration than
at present;
(d) crops will be planted at the optimum time; and
(e) irrigations will be given at critical stages of crop
growth.
3.37      These changes have the following implications for the planning,
design and operation of irrigation projects:
(a) the water supply will have to be reliable, i.e. the farmers
must be assured that they can get water at the time the crop
needs it;



- 20 -
(b) the operation of the systems will have to be more flexible;
(c) the peak carrying capacity of the system will have to be higher
than at present.
Conclusion
3.38      Gujarat's agriculture is well-placed to become highly productive by
the next century. Its advantages are:
(a) climate and soils that favor the cultivation of fruit, vege-
tables, condiments and spices and the development of a dairy
industry;
(b) progressive and commercially-minded farmers; and
(c)  rapidly expanding markets close to its most productive
agricultural areas.,
One of the major remaining uncertainties is:  can the irrigation systems be
made complete and responsive to enough to exploLt this potential?
IV. THE IRRIGATION SUB-SECTOR
Need for Irrigation
4.01      Based on the amount of rainfall and its variability, GOG has assessed
the need for irrigation as follows:
Annual         Coefficient of       Irrigation            Percent of
Rainfall         Variability             Needs            State's Area
Less than 500 mm       over 60%         Exceptionally High         16%
Less than 500 mm       40 - 60%              Very High             21%
500 - 1,000 mm         40 - 60%              High                  26%
500 - 1,000 mm         20 - 40%              Moderate              26%
1,000 - 2,000 mm       20 - 40%              ModErately Low        10%
over 2,000 mm          20 - 40%              Low                    1%
4.02      According to this classification, Kutch, with an annual rainfall
of 250 mm-400 mm has a very high to exceptionally high need for irrigation.
In Saurashtra, the rainfall is higher (400 - 70C mm) and more reliable, and
the need ranges from moderate in the eastern part to very high along the Bay
of Kutch. On the Gujarat mainland, with rainfall ranging between 500 mm and
2,000 mm, the need for irrigation decreases from very high in parts of
Banaskantha district in the north to low in parts of Valsad District in the
south. But, as evidenced by the highly variable paddy yields, this classifica-
tion of "low" needs in the south is misleading as it does not take into
account the uneven distribution of the monsoon rainfall. Irrigation needs



- 21 -
in the south are therefore higher than would be expected on the basis of annual
rainfall alone. It is also the only area in which there are large storage
systems still to be developed.
4.03      Moreover, in terms of income distribution, the irrigation needs of
the south are very high. This region, the "Eastern" area, is by all indica-
tors the poorest region of the State, and a large proportion of its rural
population is tribal (para. 2.14 and Map IBRD 14923). The Damanganga, Heran
and Karjan schemes to be financed under the proposed credit are located there
(Map 14606).
Water Resources and Irrigation Potential
4.04      The distribution of Gujarat's water resources is heavily concen-
trated in the southern and central parts of the gainland. Three mijor rivers
(Narmada,3with a mean annual runoff of 44,800 Mm ; Tapi, 19,700 Mm ; and Mahi
11,800 Mm ) flow through this area, which has a relatively high rainfall.
The northern mainland, Saurashtra and Kutch, with high to exceptionally high
needs for irrigation, have limited surface and groundwater resources.
4.05      The State's groundwater resou5ces are about 100,000 Mm3 1/ and the
surface water resources about 82,000 Mm 2/. However, the potential for
development of the surface resources is limited by a number of factors:
(a) All the rivers, except the Narmada and the Tapi, are
seasonal, and more than 90% of the total flow occurs
during the June-September monsoon when the need for
irrigation is the lowest;
(b) In most parts of the State and especially in Saurashtra
and Kutch, the topography is not conducive to the con-
struction of large dams and the dam sites are typically
costly to develop; and
(c)  The Narmada, Tapi and Mahi rivers all have the major
part of their catchments in other States and the
availability of water for Gujarat depends largely
on interstate agreements.

4.06      Taking these constraints into account, the available water resources
and the present utilization of irrigation water, which is estimated at 34% of
the potential, are estimated as follows:

/e   The Narmada water will be transferred outs:ide the basin and benefit areas
in all the major sub-divisions of the State but the water allocation is
not yet decided. Consequently, the surface water resources of Narmada
have been listed separately.
4.07      The total groundwater resources will probably increase significantly
--excluding those areas where the aquifers are saline and likely to remain so--
since at least 15-20% of the total surface water diverted in an irrigation
project is likely to percolate to the aquifer int the command area. In Mahi-
Kadana and Ukai-Kakrapar the freshwater aquifers are already highly charged as
a result of surface irrigation. Groundwater development will be influenced
by:
(a)  the cost of pumping and the supply of fuel, for both private
and public wells;
(b)  the level of service offered by wells, compared with
canals;
(c)  the yield of the aquifer.
Given the above, the conjunctive use of ground and surface water is likely to
play an important future role.
Past Development
4.08.     General Trends.  In 1950, the irrigated area in Gujarat was only
about 0.46 M ha (5% of the cropped area), almost exclusively served from wells.



- 23 -
A number of irrigation projects were started in the 1950s, but implementation
was slow, and not until the early 1960s did the development of surface irri-
gation accelerate. The private development of groundwater was much more rapid
and accounted for two-thirds of the increase in the net irrigated area between
1950/51 and 1975/76 as shown below:

/a   The results from the 1970/71 agricultural census indicate that the
area irrigated, according to official statistics, from major and medium
schemes might be over-estimated by 50-60% and from groundwater by about
30%. The adjusted estimate assumed that: (i) the census figures are
correct; and (ii) the relative error in the agricultural official stat-
istics has remained unchanged since 1970/71.
4.09      According to official statistics, about 18% of the cropped area
(1.76 M ha) is presently irrigated. This figure is less than two-thirds of
the national average (28%), and only two States (Madhya Pradesh and
Maharashtra) have a lower percentage of its cropped area irrigated. Wheat
and cotton have accounted for most of the expansion of the irrigated area
since Independence. The general trends in irrigation of major crops are:

4.10       Surface Irrigation Projects.  At Independence, there were only
two small canal systems in Gujarat both of which dated back to the ninteenth
century.  A major reason for the almost complete lack of irrigation projects
was that Saurashtra, which combines a high need for irrigation with a reason-
able potential, consisted of about 200 Princely States. Their technical and
financial resources were limited and even minor schemes created conflicts
over riparian rights. Moreover, the alluvial plains of mainland Gujarat did
not offer easily developed damsites.
4.11       In the early 1950s, three major schemes were started (Map 14606):
Mahi Right Bank Canal (RBC) with a cultivable command area (CCA) of about
143,000 ha; Kakrapar, CCA of about 225,000 ha; and Shetrunji, CCA of about
57,000 ha. Mahi and Kakrapar were both diversion schemes, while Shetrunji has
a dam for storage of monsoon flow for use in the rabi and hot weather seasons.
On all three projects, progress of storage and diversion construction was
relatively rapid but canal construction lagged far behind. The Bank Group's
first loan or credit for irrigation development in India financed the construc-
tion of Shetrunji's canal system (Credit No. 13-IN, 1961, US$4.5 M). Like
other Indian irrigation projects financed by the Bank Group at about the same
time, the Shetrunji project failed to achieve i:s agricultural potential due
to inadequate agricultural supporting services and lagging construction of
field channels and drains. These problems led GOI, the State Governments and
the Bank Group to focus on the development of the distribution network, as
well as the construction of dams and canals.
4.12       Based on these experiences, the Kadana Irrigation Project (Credit
No. 176-IN, 1970, US$35.0 M) was the first of a second generation of Bank
Group financed irrigation projects in India. I1: included: (i) a dam across



- 25 -
the Mahi River mainly to provide storage for the Mahi RBC; (ii) construction
of a Left Bank Canal (LBC) with a CCA of 11,000 ha; (iii) extension of the
Mahi RBC to serve 263,000 ha; (iv) construction of field channels, drains
and landshaping and financing of these works through institutional credit;
(v) construction of market roads; and (vi) an agricultural support program.
The Kadana project is now essentially completed, about two years behind
schedule due to two extreme floods which seriously disrupted dam construction,
and to other construction problems. A Project Completion Report is under
preparation.
4.13      The Ukai project was started in 1960 to provide carry-over storage
for the Kakrapar Project and to extend the CCA to cover a total of about
375,000 ha. Up to 1977, an irrigation potential of 314,000 ha had been created,
but only about 146,000 ha were actually irrigated. The canal system, especially
in the old Kakrapar part, was not designed to meet the exacting requirements of
modern high yielding varieties and inadequate drainage has created problems of
waterlogging. The GOG is presently undertaking a major program of on-farm
development, drainage and modernization works in the Ukai-Kakrapar command,
part of which is to be financed under the proposed credit. Command area
development is also in progress in the Shetrunji and Mahi-Kadana areas.
4.14      While the State's major irrigation works are concentrated on the
Gujarat mainland--only Shetrunji is located in Saurashtra and no major proj-
ect is located in Kutch--the about 65 completed medium irrigation projects
(MIPs) are located in all parts of the State. The dry areas of Kutch and
Saurashtra have been given priority in the concentration of MIPs. However,
because of the limited water resources in Kutch, only a few medium projects
have been built there.
4.15      Typically, tanks for storage of local runoff during the monsoon
provide only supplementary irrigation during the kharif season and the area
irrigated varies substantially from year to year. The district panchayats
are responsible for the construction--with the assistance of the Public works
Department's Irrigation Wing--and the maintenance of tanks and other minor
irrigation projects. Due to the large variations in monsoon rainfall and
poor maintenance, the water supply from these projects is unreliable, and
they have lower priority than major and medium projects. The exception is
in the low rainfall areas of the State where there are few possibilities for
larger projects and where important social benefits can be derived from
minor irrigation projects.
4.16      Groundwater.  For centuries, Gujarat farmers have used wells for
irrigation. At Independence, the well irrigated area in the State was
0.40 M ha. During the 1950s, the well irrigated area increased at an annual
rate of about 3.5%, mainly due to the sinking of new wells. In the 1960s,
the pace of development almost doubled and traditional lift methods such as
Persian wheels, poise lifts and rope-buckets were rapidly replaced by pumps
driven by diesel engines. In several areas, the limit of groundwater
resources is now being approached and the overall pace of development
is slowing down. At present, there are some 700,000 wells, over half of which
are equipped with pumpsets, and about 2,500 tubewells.



- 26 -
4.17      In the hard rock areas of Saurashtra, large diameter open dugwells
must be used. These wells depend on rains for annual recharge and the well
discharge varies substantially over the year. In years of low rainfall, many
of the wells are almost completely dry. In the alluvial areas, dug-cum-bore
wells are usually used. They are a development of the open dug well in that
a boring of about 15 cm diameter is sunk in the bottom of the dug well in order
to increase the flow. These borings may be as deep as 100 m. A dug-cum-bore
well in alluvium typically has three times as large capacity as dug well in
hard rock areas, and the discharge is much more reliable. Most of the tube-
wells are located in the northern part of the Gujarat mainland with deep
alluvial soils. Public tubewells--slightly over half of all tubewells--are
constructed by the Gujarat Water Resources Development Corporation but are
operated and maintained by the district panchayats. Private tubewells are
often owned by a group of farmers.
4.18      Investigations of groundwater potential and the establishment of well
spacing criteria are the responsibility of the State Directorate of Groundwater
Investigations. Gujarat is, so far, the only Indian State that has passed
groundwater legislation, but it has not yet become effective. In the mean-
time, GOG relies on lending institutions for the enforcement of well spacing
criteria; this program has been any partially sluccessful.
4.19      There are two major problem areas in the State.  One is located
in the areas with a deep aquifer in Mahesana District, the other along the
southern coast of Saurashtra. In the latter aresa, overdraft of the aquifer
has occured for about two decades. This has re,ulted in a worsening problem
of salt water intrusion from the sea and each year a number of wells go out of
production and the area irrig;ated declines rapidly. The proposed project
would finance the construction of small and medium sized surface irrigation
schemes along the coast to replace the wells and, thus, take the pressure of
the aquifer.
4.20      The IDA has supported the development of groundwater in the State
through the Gujarat Agricultural Credit Project (Credit No. 191-IN, 1970,
US$35.0 M). This project financed, inter alia, construction of about 41,000
wells and about 450 tubewells, and installation of about 45,000 pumpsets.
V. ASSESSMENT OF GUJARAT'S PAST IRRIGATION PROGRAM
A. Irrigation Investments
General
5.01      Since the beginning of the First Five Year Plan, GOG has made con-
siderable efforts to expand the irrigation facilities of the State, primarily
through investments in major and medium projects and through the support of
private groundwater development. In previous plans, irrigation has amounted
to about one-sixth of the State's expenditures, but its share has now risen to
25%. In each successive plan, the expenditures on major and medium projects
have increased significantly in real terms:

/a   The all-India investment price index has been used to convert the invest-
ments to constant 1978/79 prices.
/b   These costs are calculated by dividing the expenditures by the number of
hectares of potential created during that period. They are not costs per
ha of potential created in any one project (para 5.04).
5.02      Thus, since 1951/52, GOG has invested a total of about Rs 9,547 M
(US$1,137 M) in major and medium irrigation schemes. During the same period,
the irrigation potential 1/ created has increased by 1.02 M ha, from 0.02 M ha
to 1.04 M ha. The average cost per ha of "irrigation potential created" during
this period has been about Rs 9,400 which is about 30% higher than the national
average. The higher cost can, to a large extent, be explained by a relative
lack of good dam sites. However, the "utilization" (para 5.04) of the irriga-
tion potential created is significantly lower in Gujarat resulting in a cost
of Rs 16,000 per irrigated ha, or about twice the national average: This
considerable difference in cost is due to the following factors:
1/   The irrigation potential is calculated by a straight addition of the
areas under all irrigated crops in the design cropping pattern, no matter
how much water the crops require, how long they stand in the field or
what economic benefits they produce. The irrigation potential has been
"created" when the Government system has been constructed down to outlets
serving 40 ha blocks.



- 28 -
(a)  The State has few really large-scale project possibilities,
which--because of the economies of scaLe--would have resulted
in a lower cost per ha;
(b) Many of the dam sites are expensive to develop due to a
relatively flat topography;
(c) The inclusion of perennials in the cropping pattern--for
which the climate of Gujarat is suited---reduces the area
that can be irrigated with a limited amount of water; and
(d)  Many parts of Gujarat are drought-prone and, consequently,
GOG has used low irrigation intensities in the design of
projects in order to benefit as many farmers as possible;
this means the distribution system is extended over large
areas, which results in a higher cost rer ha of irrigation
potential created.
Economic Viability of Irrigation Investments
5.03      The economic viability of GOG's irrigation investments is determined
not only by the investment cost per hectare, but also by the rate of project
implementation and the resulting agricultural production. No comprehensive
data exist which permit an accurate estimate of the agricultural benefits that
have resulted from GOG's investments in major and medium projects. However,
a project completion report on the Mahi-Kadana project recently undertaken by
the Bank shows a rate of return of 12% on the whole project, which is approxi-
mately equal to the opportunity cost of capital. 1/ Most medium irrigation
projects appear to have a higher rate of return due to their shorter gestation
periods. The large Ukai-Kakrapar Project appears to have a lower rate of
return. For the whole investment program, it is Likely that the rate of
return has exceeded 12%, but that due to delays in construction 2/ and lags
in utilization, it has been below the national avierage.  It should also be
noted that the indirect economic and social benef:Lts are considerable in this
drought prone State. Nevertheless, the analysis in the remainder of this
chapter shows that it would be feasible to achieve higher economic returns by
correcting existing deficiencies. In fact, by adopting the recommended design
standards GOG could, with a given investment budget: (i) irrigate a larger
area; (ii) benefit more farmers; and (iii) achieve a higher agricultural pro-
duction in the command areas.
1/   The opportunity cost of capital for India is estimated at 12%.
2/   This is particularly the case in the Ukai project; although the dam was
nearing completion in 1970, practically no work was done on the canal
and distributaries. The cost of the canal system was therefore very much
higher than originally assumed and the benefits were also delayed.

B. Utilization of Irrigation Potential
General
5.04      As noted above, there is a great discrepancy in most major and some
medium projects between the irrigation potential planned and the "utilization"
(see Table T-16). The data reveal that, although there have been some improve-
ments in the degree of utilization, the ratio has remained below 50%. However,
even this 50% understates the problem, as the "utilization" figures are the
result of a straight addition to the area irrigated in each season (regardless
of crop), whereas the "potential" figures result from adding the area irrigated
under each crop over the entire year. In the "utilization" figures, the
irrigated areas under two seasonals are thus double-counted, and those under
perennials triple-counted, in this comparison between potential and utilization.
The apparently high utilization ratio for the Kakrapar system (Table T-17) can
thus be explained largely by the predominance of perennials in the cropping
pattern. unfortunately, data that would more accurately represent the utiliza-
tion ratio are not available. These figures also indicate that the overall
performance of tubewells has been much superior to that of the major and
medium schemes; and that the performance of the minor schemes, though initially
worse than the medium and major, has now overtaken the latter's.
5.05      The principal reasons for this "underutilization" are:
(a) the technical inadequacy of the irrigation system, resulting
from deficiencies in the planning, design, construction,
operation and maintenance of the projects;
(b) unrealistic assumptions about the available water supply, the
crop water requirements and the irrigation losses leading to
a significant over-estimation of the area that can be irrigated
with the water available;
(c) lack of appropriate assistance to farmers for on-farm development;
(d) inadequate agricultural supporting services;
(e) unsatisfactory coordination between the agencies involved in
the development and exploitation of the command area; and
(f) agro-climatic factors.
Irrigation Technology
5.06      The key to successful irrigation development is to provide a relia-
ble water supply at the farmgate with a minimum of transit losses between
the dam and the plant. If the farmer has faith in the irrigation supply,
he will be keen to develop his land and buy the inputs that are required
for successful cultivation of high yielding high value crops. In the remainder
of this chapter, various aspects of planning, design, construction, operation
and maintenance as they relate to the performance of major irrigation projects



- 30 -
in Gujarat are analyzed. The main conclusion of this review is that the tech--
nology adopted in the past for major and medium irrigation projects is such
that it cannot provide a reliable water supply at the farmgate. This conclu-
sion is likely to apply to many Indian irrigatior. projects.
Assumptions about Hydrology, Water Losses and Crop Water Requirements
5.07      In many projects, the annual inflow into the reservoir, and thus
the area that could be commanded, have been overEstimated. This was the case
for Bhadar irrigation scheme, which was completed in 1963. Virtually no stream
flow data was available, and an assumed 17% run off factor was applied to the
limited rainfall data available: during the 13 years of operation, the reser-
voir filled only in 3 years. In 1972/73, a year of very severe water shortage,
rabi and hot weather irrigation supplies were completely stopped and whatever
water was available was used to supply Rajkot city.  The project authorities
are now redefining the scope of the scheme.
5.08      GOG has traditionally assumed that the seepage loss in unlined
channels is 8 cusecs/M sq. ft.  Rather than actu-lly calculating the losses
using these seepage rates and the wetted perimetEr of the project channels,
percentage figures for the losses in different pE.rts of the system are used
in GOG's water balance calculations. Typically these figures imply an overall
project efficiency--i.e., from dam to plant--of 40-50%. Data 1/ from projects
in Gujarat and other parts of India indicate that the losses are three to
four time the losses assumed:

Our estimate of overall efficiency in unlined projects is of the order of
25-30% and 30-35% for major and medium projects, respectively. A sample
of existing major and medium 1/ projects in the State indicates that water-
use efficiency in the rabi season is in the range of 25-30% for the major
schemes, and 25-45% for the medium schemes. As the efficiency is lower in
the kharif, an average for the year would be between 30% and 35%. The fol-
lowing table summarizes the findings:

/a   Assuming an average water requirement of the cropping pattern of
4,300 m 3/ha.
5.09      Water requirements for most crops and field losses are underestimated
in most Project Reports. This is especially the case for projects planned in
the 1950s and 1960s before the high yielding varieties were introduced. For
most kharif crops, the design water requirements are only about two-thirds of
those actually required. The reason is that the estimates are based on the
requirements in a "normal year" when rainfall is fairly evenly distributed over
the season. In Gujarat, drought spells of three to four weeks or sometimes
longer occur in the middle of the monsoon which immediately raises the water
requirements.
5.10      The cumulative effect of too optimistic planning assumptions (regard-
ing crop water requirements and irrigation losses) is that the irrigation
potential often is overestimated by 50% or more. Thus, the "irrigation poten-
tial"--as defined in project reports--sets unrealistic targets for what can
be achieved in projects designed and constructed to present standards. Or
put in another way, most projects in Gujarat probably utilize the de facto
potential available at the present level of technology when actual losses and
crop water requirements are taken into account.
Organizational Aspects
5.11      Organizational factors (c, d, and e in para 5.05) have been exhaus-
tively discussed and analyzed, inter alia, in the reports of the Irrigation
Commission (1972) and the Agricultural Commission (1976). In order to achieve

an effective coordination between irrigation management and agricultural
supporting services and to assist the farmers to carry out on-farm development,
GOG has established three Command Area Developmelnt Authorities (CADA): one
for Mahi-Kadana; one for Ukai-Kakrapar; and one for a group of smaller pro-
jects in Northern Gujarat and Saurashtra. Each CADA is headed by an Area
Development Commissioner (ADC) who reports to the Secretary, Agriculture.
Although the CADAs have had some positive impact on irrigation utilization
and agricultural development in the project areas, they have failed to live
up to the high expectations that the Irrigation and Agricultural Commissions
established for their performance. There are a number of reasons for their
relatively modest achievements; among the reasons are:
(a)  the CADAs do not have any staff of their own and the ADCs
fulfill only a coordinating function. The parent depart-
ments (the Agriculture and Irrigation Departments) retain
full technical and partial administrative control of their
field units;
(b)  there is no professional cadre of traired and experienced
land development and water management specialists who can
operate the system in full response to agricultural
requirements or who can properly advise farmers on land
development and irrigation practices;
(c)  the incentive system for the agricultuTal and irrigation staff
is such that they regard the work under CADA as only a tempo-
rary assignment in their careers;
(d)  the ADCs are frequently transferred.  Because of the lack of
a permanent, professional CADA staff, the ADC provides the
only unifying force in the projects. However, with the
limited term (often only a year) that an ADC serves, there
is little continuity in policies and few clear objectives
for the CADA work;
(e)  the present practice of financing communal field channels
and field drains through agricultural credit has created
great administrative difficulties. Sinze some farmers in
the command areas (for example, those who are located
closest to the irrigation outlet) have little to gain from
the construction of field channels, they are re:Luctant to
help finance works that will benefit other farmers in the
chak most. This means that the land development staff has
to spend a significant part of their time in persuading
farmers to participate.  Furthermore, the administrative
cost of providing the credit is high and, because of the
limited gains that some farmers make from the on-farm
works, the default rate is high. The two latter factors
are putting a severe strain on the land development banks
and are now threatening their financial viability; and



- 33 -
(f) no systematic research work on land development and water
management is carried out in Gujarat. As a result, there
is no firm technical guidance for the CADA's work.
5.12      However, until irrigation projects are planned, designed and con-
structed in such a manner that they can deliver a reliable water supply to
each farmer in the command area, there is only a limited scope for CADA to
improve the utilization of irrigation potential and increase crop yields.
Thus, improvements of irrigation infrastructure and CAD/on-farm works are
complementary and reinforce each other.
Agro-Climatic Factors
5.13      Agro-climatic factors have, so far, received insufficient attention
in the analysis of the slow uptake of irrigation. However, there appears
to be a general behavioral pattern of the farmers in India related to the
amount of rainfall: in the low rainfall, drought-prone areas, the benefits
of irrigation are obvious and the farmers rapidly switch from rainfed to
irrigated crops. The same thing appears to be true in higher rainfall areas
where the climate and soils allow a switch from rainfed coarse grains to
irrigated paddy. However, the uptake of irrigation is much slower in areas
with intermediate rainfall (say 700-1,200 mm) where, in a normal year, farmers
can grow a rainfed crop without too much risk and where the quantity of water
available does not allow an easy switch to water consuming crops such as paddy
and perenni'al crops. Most of mainland Gujarat falls into this category.
5.14      In the intermediate rainfall areas of Gujarat, the predominant food-
grain crops under rainfed conditions are pearl millet and sorghum. The local
varieties of kharif and rabi sorghum and pearl millet give low yields under
irrigation. The high-yielding/hybrid varieties of sorghum have not spread--
except in the traditional grain-producing areas of Vadodara, Bharuch and Surat--
possibly as a result of the low fodder/grain ratio. Uptake of the high-
yielding/hybrid varieties of pearl millet has been rapid, but the high incidence
of downy mildew has caused a recent decline in the area grown. Paddy is a
suitable irrigated kharif foodgrain, but is confined to the central and south-
ern mainland districts. Wheat is the only widely-grown foodgrain that has
responded well to irrigation, and that has not been subject to pests and
disease--hence the rapid growth in the area grown. To give high and stable
yields, kharif foodgrains should be planted in June before the start of the
monsoon, but under present GOG procedures for allocating water and operating
irrigation projects, most farmers do not get the first irrigation until the
latter part of July. Consequently, the farmers in canal commands still orient
their planting operations around the onset of the monsoon rains and thus
realize only part of the potential benefits from irrigation. It seems clear
that a much larger number of farmers would apply for and depend upon kharif
irrigation if the first irrigation was given before rather than after the
monsoon rains have started.
5.15      Successful cultivation of irrigated cotton requires expensive inputs
and is difficult to fit into GOG's irrigation seasons; moreover, recently it
has been subject to serious pest attacks. Furthermore, water logging is a
serious problem encountered by cotton cultivators in some surface irrigation



- 34 -
schemes; for example, the rising groundwater table in Ukai-Kakrapar has led to
a decline in the area under cotton. Cash crops such as fruit, vegetables,
spices and condiments typically give higher incomes when irrigated but the
frequency and reliability of canal supplies are inadequate for a profitable
and risk-free crop. The cultivation of such crops--for which the climate
and soils of Gujarat are ideal:Ly suited--is constrained by the water supply
and the high cost of the on-farm investments required. To sum up, the farmers
in the low to moderate rainfal:L areas of the Gujarat mainland have only a limi-
ted choice of crops that can be profitably grown under canal irrigation. How-
ever, if the canal supplies are made more reliable, and the irrigation seasons
are adjusted to coincide with the optimum planting dates of the major seasonal
crops, then the range of profitable crops would be much greater and the use
of irrigation water in kharif would become the rule.
C.  Project Preparation
General
5.16      One major reason for the apparently low utilization of irrigation
potential is the inadequate preparation of major and medium irrigation projects.
Not enough staff and funds are made available to carry out the necessary data
collection, survey work, evaluation of different alternatives, etc. Project
reports that are submitted for approval are based on investigations that
typically have been carried out several years before the report is issued.
After approval, the report becomes the basic document for implementation of
the project. It is not uncommon that the last patt of a major project is
completed in accordance with a project report prepared some 15 years earlier
and based on investigations done 20 years ago.
5.17      Over the last two decades, new high-yielding crop varieties have
been introduced, market conditions have changed drastically, the use of
fertilizer has become a widespread practice; as a result, the comparative
advantages of various crops have changed. The new crop varieties have differ-
ent demands in terms of quantity and timing of irrigation. During the last
few years, the stock of technical knowledge has increased significantly.
Various project designs have been tried out in other projects and experience
is becoming increasingly available to indicate how these designs function in
practice. Time has also been available for further stream flow measurements,
monitoring of canal losses in the already completed projects, soil surveys,
etc. All this additional data, together with the experience from operating
projects--if properly utilized--could have provided the basis for refinements
in the designs of on-going and new projects. Planning of irrigation projects
in the future must be a continuous process into which there is a systematic
feedback of experience from projects already under implementation and operation.
5.18      Under the Gujarat Irrigation Project (Credit No. 808-IN), GOG is
strengthening its preparation for medium irrigation projects, and the major
projects proposed for financing under the Gujarat :[rrigation II Project have
been prepared to higher standards than in the past. However, there is still



- 35 -
scope for further improvements in the hydrological and agricultural data bases
and in their use for project preparation.
Design of the Distribution System
5.20      General.  The distribution system--distributaries, minors and sub-
minors--is the most critical factor of an irrigation project in determining
its performance.   However, with present staffing priorities, it is the part
of the project that receives the least attention. At present, only about
one-tenth of the total engineering effort invested in the project goes into
the survey, design and construction of the distribution system. As a conse-
quence, the distribution system is "under-engineered" and constitutes the
weakest link in the water's route from the river to the field. The following
discussion focuses on some of the major deficiencies in the design of the
distribution network.
5.21      Alignment of Channels and Location of Outlets.  In existing projects
the alignment of many channels is poor and a large number of outlets are
incorrectly located. The main reasons are: (i) maps used are not detailed
enough for proper alignment of the channels and correct positioning of the
outlets; (ii) the manpower input for survey and design is too low for suf-
ficient accuracy in the work. As a result, large areas are, in fact, not
commanded; and (iii) division of responsibility for the lay-out, design and
construction, and a lack of coordination between the respective government
agencies results in large areas being out of command. In other areas, farmers
break the channels to irrigate land not served by the outlets. Poor alignment
of the channels, high seepage losses and lack of control in the distribution
system seriously affects the water supply to the tail portions of distri-
butaries and minors resulting in very unreliable supply to the tail outlets.
To improve the quality of survey and design of the distribution system, the
manpower allocation to this phase of project implementation has to be signi-
ficantly increased.
5.22      Cross Regulators.  There is a general lack of cross regulators in
the distribution system and off-taking channels and outlets cannot draw their
full discharge when the flow in the parent channel is below the design dis-
charge. In the absence of proper cross regulation, excessive flows are
maintained in the distribution network in order to ensure that the water level
is high enough for the offtakes to operate adequately. Another consequence of
the lack of cross regulation is that farmers build small bunds at the bottom
of the channels in order to get the full flow from the outlets. To overcome
this problem, some offtakes and outlets have been set at the bottom of the
parent channel with the result that silt and debris interfere with the oper-
ation of the offtakes and outlets. The lack of cross regulation in the
distribution system results in: (i) unreliable flows in the smaller channels
and through outlets; (ii) excessive operational losses; and (iii) higher
maintenance costs.
5.22      Size of Chaks.  At present, the farmers are responsible for water
distribution and for maintenance of the channels below the chak outlet. Ex-
perience from existing project shows that cooperation between farmers is
very limited and that the field channels are poorly constructed and maintained.



- 36 -
In most cases, the farmers closest to the outlets take more than their share
of water, and the losses in conveyance of water to the tail-end are excessive.
As a result, the distribution of water is both inequitable and inefficient. A
study of 88 chaks (average size about 40 ha) in the Ukai Kakrapar Project
givbes an indication of the benefits that accrue to farmers located in the
upper, middle and lower third of the chak:
Annual Intensity
Location             of Irrigation
Upper Third               117%
Middle Third               98%
Lower Third                78%
5.23      The inequity inside the chak increases with the size of the chak 1/
and so do the water losses in the field channels.  A review of irrigation data
collected for the study mentioned above indicates that the field channel
losses are related to the size of the chak in the following manner:
Field Channel Losses as % of the
Size of Chak           Flow at the Outlet to the Chak
(ha)
8                               14%
20                               22%
40                               32%
80                               39%
5.24      With some chaks as large as 200 ha, often some 50 farmers have to
coordinate their irrigation schedules and agree on maintenance of the communal
channels inside the chak. The inequities in water distribution and the poor
maintenance of field channels that have been observed during field visits to
Mahi-Kadana, Ukai-Kakrapar and other projects in Gujarat, clearly show that
such large groups of farmers cannot cooperate sufficiently to operate the
chaks. There are three main reasons for this: (i) the rich and powerful
farmers are at an advantage over the smaller farme:rs; (ii) the benefits of
channel maintenance and equitable water distibution are unevenly distributed
over the chak and thus, some farmers--usually locat:ed near the outlet--have
no incentive to participate in the maintenance; and (iii) when the outlet is
located at least 1 km away from the field, the irr:igator cannot properly check
that there are no breaches on the field channel--from natural or man-made
causes. The only feasible solution at this stage of development is for the
1/   Field inspections and discussions with farmers indicate that the fields'
located at the tailend of the field channel ol-ten suffer from water
stress resulting in lower yields than those achieved on fields near the
outlet. This compounds the inequities that are the result of different
irrigation intensities in different reaches along the field channel. The
larger the chak, the longer the field channel and, thus, the greater the
inequities.



- 37 -
Government to be responsible for the water distribution much further down in
the system. 1/ This can be achieved through (i) a significant reduction of the
chak size and (ii) enforcement of a fixed irrigation schedule for each farmer--
for instance, rotational water supply (RWS). Improvements in this area would
encourage lining of the field channels to reduce conveyance losses and to make
the supply to the individual farmer more reliable; indeed, recent experiments
with RWS on the Mahi-Kadana scheme have given positive results.
5.25      Lining of the Distribution System.  In association with the Gujarat
Irrigation Project, GOG adopted for medium projects a policy of lining the
whole canal system down to outlets serving 8 ha blocks, which will be the gene-
ral criterion for the components under the proposed project. Detailed analyses
of the benefits of lining have been carried out for medium irrigation projects
in Gujarat 2/ and major projects in Maharashtra. 3/ The estimated project
efficiencies change with the amount of lining as follows: 4/
1/   This conclusion is supported by, inter alia two studies carried out by
the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad: "Irrigation System,
on-farm development and extension service in Chambal Project, Rajasthan"
by V.N. Asopa, S.C. Bhatnagar, B.M. Desai, A.H. Kalro and P.N. Shingi and
"Command Area Development in Mahi-Kadana" by V.N. Asopa and B.L. Tripathi.
In both studies, the farmers' attitudes towards cooperative water distri-
bution was investigated and the conclusion from Chambal is applicable to
farmers in both project areas: "Indeed, they (the farmers) wanted the
(water allocation) system to be more rigorous and generally did not favor
farmers' participation either individually or in groups, in decision-
making relating to the distribution of water" (page 169).

4/   Note that the efficiencies depend on various factors such as topography,
soils, depth to groundwater table and method of systems operation. Thus,
the figures in the two columns are not strictly comparable. However, when
read "vertically", the estimated efficiencies give a consistent picture
of the improved performance at higher levels of technology.

5.26      Available cost data indicate that investments made in lining of the
canals and distribution system give an economic rate of return of about 20%,
which is considerably higher than for investments made in unlined projects.
Cost estimates for the medium projects in Gujarat and the major projects in
Maharashtra indicate that linirng of sub-minors/water courses from the 40 ha to
the 8 ha level increase the project cost by 6 - 7T but result in an increase
in the irrigated area by 15-20%.
5.27      In the Karjan and Heran Projects, the cost of lining the sub-minors
and water courses from the 20 ha level to the 8 ha level would increase project
cost 2-3% and help increase the irrigated area some 8-10%. 1/  Lining minors
and water courses not only reduces the seepage losses but--more importantly--
also ensures the structural integrity of the channel and thus allows water to
be distributed in a more equitable and reliable fashion. As a result, farmers
are more likely to get the right amount of water at the right time.
Commissioning Period
5.28      No large scale construction activities can be carried out without
errors and mistakes. When any irrigation project starts to operate, it will be
found that some outlets are incorrectly positioned, that a contractor has not
followed the specifications for the construction of a control structure, that
there is a need for a cross regulator in a critical location, etc. Usually it
is relatively cheap to correct these mistakes--provided it is done soon after
the work have been completed--and it results in significant benefits. However,
1/   Based on the data from Ukai-Kakrapar the fie]d ditch efficiency would
increase from 0.78 to 0.86 or by 10% when the chak size is reduced from
20 ha to 8 ha.  This gain would, to a minor extent, be offset by losses in
the lined sub-minor, but the net increase in irrigated area would be at
least 8%.



- 39 -
no budget or staff allocations are made for this purpose. Even though eventual
major construction errors are corrected, there is no "fine-tuning" of the
system and, as a result, the projects do not yield their potential benefits.
In order to fully utilize these major investments each part of a project
should go through a two year commissioning period 1/ when the system can be
adjusted and necessary modifications carried out. During this period, the
operating and construction staff would share the responsibility for the system
and a special budget allocation should be made for this purpose.
Operation
5.29      There is ample evidence that many of the kharif crops, in most parts
of the State, give higher yields if they are planted in June rather than in
July. Late planting of kharif crops also delays planting of rabi crops with
resulting adverse impact on yields. In some cases, the late harvest of the
kharif crop can even preclude the cultivation of a rabi crop. This was
clearly illustrated by the small area under rabi crops in Mahi-Kadana last
year when storage water was available for the first time. The approval of
water applications comes only after the reservoir has started to fill up in
mid-July and most farmers cannot get the first irrigation with the end of
July. This usually results in too late a planting date, especially if the
application is rejected and the crop has to be grown under rainfed conditions.
Being "risk minimizers" the farmers plant with the first monsoon rains at the
end of June or beginning of July and go for a "low technology package" under
the assumption that they might not get any irrigation water. Only in the case
of drought during the late stages of the crop will they think that irrigation
is worth the water charge, and thus, apply for water. Consequently, in normal
years, the potentital for kharif irrigation is greatly underutilized, espec-
ially in the medium and high rainfall areas. The available evidence indicates
that timely irrigations in kharif result in yields that are significantly
higher than under rainfed conditions. Thus there is a need for a fundamental
change in the incentive system for kharif irrigation. The following modifica-
tions would lead to substantial production increases in most major projects:
(a) Starting the kharif irrigation season in June rather than
in July. This would require carryover storage in the res-
ervoir, 2/ which--it is commonly argued--would be costly
in terms of evaporation losses. However, carryover storage
is anyhow provided in most major projects since they have
significant areas under perennial or hot weather crops or
they provide water for power generation or domestic and
industrial uses. Thus, carryover storage for an earlier
start of the kharif season would only add marginally to
1/   The commissioning period should cover the first two years that any area
is under irrigation. Thus, it would not result in a delay of the start
of irrigation.
2/   In some cases, it may be difficult to provide carry-over for pre-monsoon
irrigation. However, because of the large economic benefits from earlier
plantings, pre-monsoon irrigation should be the rule and later start of
the irrigation season an exception.

reservoir evaporation losses. Many times, these marginally
higher evaporation losses are off-set by lower water re-
quirements for kharif and rabi crops since they can utilise
available rainfall and soil moisture better if they are
planted early; and
(b) Establish kharif water as a right for each farmer in the
command area and adjust the operational procedures in such
a way that all farme!rs are routinely provided with both pre-
monsoon water and with supplementary irrigation supplies
whenever the monsoon rains are insuffizient. 1/
5.30      Water Allocation Procedures.  According to the Bombay Irrigation
Act and Canal Rules, each farmer is entitled to The amount of water that is
required to fully irrigate the crops for which he has obtained a sanction.
The Canal Inspector is supposed to ensure that the farmers do not use exces-
sive amounts of water and that each one get the water he is entitled to.
Although this procedure has, in general, prevented gross abuses, it does not
promote an efficient and equitable use of water inside the chak. Because the
farmer is, in principle, entitled to an adequate amount of water at the
boundary of his field he has little incentive to reduce the losses between the
outlet and his field. 2/ One way of promoting efficient and equitable use of
water inside the chak would be to make the Government responsible for water
deliveries down to 8 ha outlets. However, further advances towards this
objective would be made if water allocations were determined for each farmer
in accordance with a fixed rotational schedule. In this schedule, the farmer's
water right would be defined at the outlet rather than at the field, which
would provide an incentive for the farmers to rec.uce losses inside the chak
and on their fields. Rotational water supply can be introduced within the
framework of the existing Irrigation Act if the sanctioned area under irriga-
tion and the estimated water requirement for each crop are used as the basic
parameters that determine the time allocation to each farmer. The main
drawback of the sanctioning system in effect at present is that the farmers
will apply for water for crops which maximizes their return per irrigated
hectare. However, water is a scarce resource with a high economic value and
the o4jective from the society's point of view is to maximize the returns
per m of water.
5.31      At present, a farmer who gets a sanction for a crop with high water
requirements typically increases his income much more than a farmer who gets a
sanction for a crop with low water requirements. With the present system of
sanctioning crops on an area basis, a relatively small group of farmers
preempt a large share of the water and, thus, get a major share of the bene-
fits. Since there will never be enough water for all the farmers in a command
to grow high value, high water using crops, equity requires that the amount of
water a farmer can use -- in accordance with his sanction -- has to be
1/   Even where there is no carry-over storage on hot weather irrigation.
2/   Any savings in conveyance would, in principal, benefit farmers in other
parts of the project.



- 41 -
rationed. This is difficult to do under present sanctioning procedures.
However, if rotational water supply is introduced, each farmer would receive
a fixed quantity of water at a predetermined time. 1/ The logical extension
of the rotational water delivery system would be to base the quantity of water
on the size of the holding rather than on what crops tVe farmer intends to
grow. Say, for example, each farmer would get 2,000 m /ha of water for his
holding in rabi; he would be free to use this water to irrigate any crop he
chooses. He might use the water to irrigate wheat on one-third of his land or
to irrigate gram on two-thirds of his holding.
5.32      To allocate water in volumetric terms rather than giving sanctions
based on the crops to be irrigated would probably require a change in the
Irrigation Act. However, such a change would give some significant benefits:
(a)  The farmers would select crops and adopt irrigation practices
that would maximize the returns to water--as a consequence,
the economic benefits to the society would be maximized;
(b)  A few farmers would not be able to appropriate an unfair share
of the irrigation benefits, which is the case in the Kakrapar
command at present; and
(c)  The administrative procedures would be significantly simpli-
fied to the benefit of both the farmers and GOG.
(d)  The cropping pattern would become more complex;
(e)  Most future varieties would have shorter duration than
at present;
(f)  Crops would be planted at their optimum dates; and
(g)  Irrigations would have to be given at critical stages of
crop growth.
5.33      These changes have the followng implications for the planning, design
and operation of irrigation projects:
(a)  The water supply has to be reliable, i.e., the farmers
must be ensured that they can get water at the time when
the crop needs it;
(b)  Operation of the projects, will no longer be done in accor-
dance with the traditional irrigation seasons, instead
different crops will be planted at different times, which
requires a more flexible operation of the system; and
(c) The peak carrying capacity of the system has to be higher
than at present.
1/   Quantity = Number of irrigations x time x outlet discharge.

Maintenance
5.34      The maintenance of taost irrigation projects is deficient because
of: (i) unreliable water supplies and thus interference by farmers (para
5.22); (ii) limited permanence of staff; and (iii) insufficient funds, allo-
cated as a flat rate per ha, rather than on a careful assessment of actual
maintenance needs. Improved standards for the design and operation of new
projects, assuring a reliable and timely water supply, and the establishment
of a separate CAD Department, with its own cadre of land development and
water management specialists, would help overcoma the first two problems.
However, an increased budgetary allocation--for works and materials as well
as establishment--is a prerequisite for improved maintenance. The budget
allocation for a scheme should be based on an anlual maintenance program
which identifies the works required in each segment of the scheme.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEW PROJECTS I/
General
6.01      In most major and medium irrigation projects in Gujarat, actual
crop production is significantly lower than the potential production that
could be obtained for the level of investment in irrigation infrastructure.
This shortfall is due to two factors:
(a) Yields are much lower than potential yields; and
(b) The irrigated area is much smaller than the area that
the projects have been designed to irrigate (the
"irrigation potential").
6.02      The low yields and--especially--the "underutilization" of irriga-
tion potential have been major concerns of GOI and GOG. In an attempt to
remedy the situation, CAD programs--focusing primarily on development below
the Government outlet, i.e., on the construction of field channels, drains and
land shaping--have been initiated in most major irrigation projects. The data
analyzed in this volume indicate that a lack of on-farm development is only a
partial explanation for the low yields and the underutilization of irrigation
potential. It has become increasingly clear to I3A and to GOG that major
constraints to higher yields and expansion of the irrigated areas are also
found between the dam and the Government outlet.
6.03      Actual water losses are much higher than assumed in the design of
the canal systems, which reduces the irrigated area far below the planned
target. Consequently, the underutilization of irrigation potential is largely

However, as presented here they apply primarily to Damanganga, Heran
and Karjan.



- 43 -
fictional because there is little possibility for projects designed and con-
structed to present standards to serve the area that they have been assumed
to irrigate.
6.04      Consequently, there is an urgent need to improve the planning,
design and operation of these projects with the objective of making the water
supply at the farm gate more reliable. The recommendations summarized
below are aimed at achieving this objective.
6.05      Planning Process
(a)  Planning of irrigation projects would be a continuous process
into which there is a systematic feedback of experience. To
make this possible, a continuous monitoring and evaluation
program is required to feed back information to the planners
from current experience on the construction and operation of
the project under implementation and from other projects. For
this purpose, the project preparation and monitoring cells would
be suitably strengthened; and
(b)  A systematic experimental and research program would be under-
taken so that fully developed and evaluated technologies are
available when the time is ripe to introduce them. This means
that research has to be started today on technologies that will
be needed and ready for introduction 10-15 years from now.
Provision for this would be made under the Project.
6.06      Project Preparation
(a)  A continued upgrading of existing procedures for collecting
hydrological data from rivers feeding the project, including
the continual collection and evaluation of monthly flow records
and the use of computerized reservoir operation studies;
(b)  Systematic classification of the command area for irrigability
(on the basis of detailed topographical, soil and drainage
surveys, etc); and
(c)  Preparation of periodic reviews (i.e., at approximately five
year intervals) to highlight socio-economic changes in the
project areas (e.g., labor and farm power availability) which
influence cropping patterns and water demand.
6.07      Design Standards
(a)  Increased professional manpower made available for the survey,
planning and design of the minor distribution system;
(b)  Appropriate large-scale survey work to permit proper align-
ment of minor conveyance channels and outlets;



- 44 -
(c)  Design of the required number of cross regulators in the
main and distributary canals allowing the network to be
operated efficiently at two-thirds of design depth.
(d)  Lining of the entire! conveyance system from the dam intake
down to irrigation turnouts that serve approximately 8 ha
blocks. 1/ (Implied in this criterion is the objective that
no field should be further away from a lined channel than
300 m.)  The lining would be of high quality as to reduce
conveyance losses and maintenance;
(e)  A piped distribution system (from minors down) would be pro-
vided wherever sufficient natural head is available unless
it is economically not viable.  Turnou:s from this system
would typically serve 8 ha blocks;
(f)  The minor distribution system would be planned "from the
tail-up". Thus the alignment of minors and sub-minors would be
decided first after a tentative layout of the field channels
has been prepared;
(g)  Chak sizes should be based on topography, soils, cropping
patterns and farm sizes, but would in general not exceed
20 ha. For operational purposes, the chaks would be
'broken up in 8 ha sub-chaks each served by a gated turn-
out;
(h)  Measuring devices (such as standing wave flumes and V-notch
weirs) would be provided throughout the system down to the
Government outlet;
(i)  Service roads would be provided along all channels with a
capacity above 50 cusecs and all weather bicycle/motorcyle
paths along all minors;
(j)  A master plan of the drainage system would be prepared
together with the irrigation system and in coastal areas
drains would be provided with tidal regulators; and
(k)  A modern communication system would be provided in the
catchment area (for flood control purposes) and at various
control points on th[e canal, the dam and the divisional
headquarters.
1/   The Damanganga project area has high rainfa'Ll and heavy soils.  Since
ample water would be available in the river, the lining would be
extended by down to the 20 ha level. However, the turnouts would
serve 8 ha blocks.  Furthermore, distributaries, with a capacity
between 10 cusecs and 100 cusecs, would be Lined selectively depending
upon the estimated seepage losses from unlined channels.



- 45 -
6.08      Construction Standards
(a) The irrigation system (lined distributaries, minors, sub-
minors and unlined field channels from the 8 ha turnout to
the farm-gate), and the drainage system and road networks
would be constructed simultaneously by the Government and
completed on a block-by-block basis; where necessary to
facilitate the irrigation drainage works the road network
would be constructed in advance of the other components;
(b) A commissioning period of at least two years would be intro-
duced. During this period required adjustments to the system
would be done and a special budgetary provision would be
made for this purpose. The commissioning would be on a
block-by-block basis;
(c) The organization for monitoring implementation performance
(both in quality and quantity terms) would be suitably
strengthened at both project and Sachivalaya level; and
(d) An existing dam review panel composed of specialists in
engineering geology, flood hydrology, dam design and con-
struction, would be maintained during project implementation.
This panel would meet periodically as required, but not less
tehan once in 12 months, to review and evaluate all data and
design and construction practices, and make specific recom-
mendations to GOG concerning: embankment safety; foundation
and abutment integrity; and spillway capacity.
6.09      Operational Procedures
(a) Water deliveries to the farmers would be on rotational basis
in accordance with predetermined schedules established for
the rabi and hot weather season. GOG would examine how rota-
tional deliveries can be introduced during the kharif season
when rainfall is subject to significant variations;
(b) Before the start of each irrigation season, every farmer under
a distributary/minor would be notified by CADA of his allo-
cation for water for the forthcoming season and the way the
supply will be made available to him (rotational interval).
The allocation would be based on (i) the seasonal availability
of water; (ii) the cropping pattern and the calculated water
demand for this pattern for the minor/distributary under which



- 46 -
(c) Seasonal irrigation schedules would dEpend on the storage
available in the reservoirs and would be established through
fortnightly assessments of project water requirements. These
schedules would be based on updated rainfall and streamflow
records, measured conveyance and distribution efficiencies
and information feedback on actual crcpping patterns in the
command area;
(d) Irrigation water for kharif crops, for which early planting is
beneficial, would be available at the beginning of June and
the project reservoirs would be operated to provide appropriate
carryover storage for pre-monsoon irrigation;
(e) The canals would be closed for maintenance for an appropriate
period which would be determined and publicized each yar at
the beginning of June;
(f) Annual O&M budgets would be determined on the basis of a
detailed operation and maintenance program for each segment
of the schemes; and
(g)  The method of assessing water charges would be revised to
promote the use of kharif irrigation.
6.10      Organizational Changes
(a)  A separate CAD Wing for water management would be established
in the Agricultural Department. It would be staffed with
properly trained land and water development specialists.
Although initially the staff would be deputed to the CAD
Wing, the objective is to transform the Wing into a separate
department for water management with its own cadre of land
and water management specialists.
(b)  Special Circles would be established under existing CADAs for
the Damanganga, Heran and Karjan command areas. The CADAs
would be responsible for operation and maintenance of the
projects; organizing the farmers to establish (together with
the extension service) rotational water allocation schedules
and advising farmers on land development and irrigation
practices. When sufficient trained staff would be available,
the CADAs would also be responsible for the survey, planning
and design of the minor irrigation and drainage works.

FUTURE CROPS AND CROPPING PATTERNS
Foodgrains
1.        The prospects for most kharif foodgrains becoming irrigated crops
are low, until a better variety of bajra can be developed--that is disease
resistant and responds well to irrigation. The exceptions are paddy-which
at present, is confined to the high rainfall areas of the South, but which
would probably spread as an irrigated kharif crops--and hybrid sorghum, which
responds well to irrigation. Although Gujarat is a foodgrain deficit State,
and there is therefore much unsatisfied demand, free inter-state movement of
foodgrain and GOI social policies will prevent the price of foodgrains from
rising sufficiently to make them competitors for irrigation water--where the
supply is reliable--with the high value crops in kharif. In rabi, however,
wheat is likely to remain the dominant irrigated crop (70% of it is already
irrigated). In summer, irrigated cereals will probably increase to some
extent, because of their combined fodder and grain value, as mixed farming is
a growing feature of State's agriculture. However, fodder crops with a higher
nutrient value, such as lucerne, are likely to spread faster.
Pulses
2.        As a response to high and unsatisfied demand in this largely vege-
tarian State, pulses, being an excellent source of protein, are likely to
gain an importance as a partly irrigated crop: farmers will demand a few
supplemental irrigation for them in dry kharif periods and in rabi. They
might also be increasingly grown on residual soil moisture after an irrigated
crop. Although groundnuts are generally an unirrigated kharif crop, because
of their sensitivity to water availability, they too would benefit significantly
from a few supplemental kharif irrigations in drier years. This crop will
probably continue to be grown on a large scale, particularly in Saurashtra,
where its only unirrigated kharif competitor is pearl millet. Although
Gujarat ranks only sixth among the States in its groundnut yields, they are
above the national average, and Gujarat is the largest producer in the country,
with a share of 28% of total production.
Groundnuts
3.        Even though Gujarates already have a per capita consumption of
groundnut cooking oil which is more than double the national average (512
grams/month compared with 223 grams/month), demand for this crop is never-
theless likely to grow faster than for pearl millet; until a better pearl
millet variety can be developed, and until the Narmada system irrigates
Saurashtra, groundnuts will probably remain the dominant kharif crop in
Saurashtra. Summer groundnuts, however, are likely to become an important
irrigated crop: the soils are suitable, summer prices are high, and marketing
is well-developed.

ANNEX 1
Page  2
Cotton
4.        The future of cotton as an irrigated crop is uncertain.  On the one
hand, Gujarat is the largest producer of cotton in India (27%) and produces
the greatest amnount of superior quality cotton. A.fter wheat, cotton occupies
the largest area under irrigation, mostly from grolndwater: the irrigated
proportion of the gross cropped area has risen froni 13% in 1967/68 to 20%
in 1976/77. But on the other hand, irrigated yields have not shown any signi-
ficant increase. One problem has been the prevalence of pest incidences.
However, the successful pest control campaigns orginized under the T&V system
are showing great promise. Furthermore, total wor:Ld demand is projected to
grow at only 0.9% p.a. to 1990; however, this average conceals differences in
growth rates between grades, and demand for long-staple (irrigated) cotton, in
which Gujarat has a comparative advantage, is likely to grow relatively fast.
In conclusion, although the total area under cotton in Gujarat may decline over
the coming decades, the proportion of this crop in the total irrigated area is
likely to remain roughly constant. Tobacco may slightly increase its share of
the irrigated cropping pattern, as yields are high, and Gujarat cultivates the
largest area of tobacco in India. Its success in the command area of the
Mahi-Kadana project is remarkable. Fodder, particularly lucerne, is likely
to become an increasingly important year-round irrigated crop, especially in
summer, when litle grazing is available for Gujarat's expanding livestock
population. Animal husbandry is less land-intensive than foodgrain production
and therefore offers prospects for faster and ultimately larger growth in the
income of very small landowners and for the employment of landless labor. Milk
production is particularly labor-intensive and is traditionally carried out by
the women of the households: as these women often deliver the milk to the
cooperatives, and receive the cash, its impact on the distribution of income
both between and within households is significant.
Sugarcane and Bananas
5.        Although Gujarat's sugar yields rank on:Ly eighth among the States--
and have not increased in the last few years--and sugar recovery is lower
than that obtained in the main growing areas of Maharasthra, the area under
sugarcane and banana - the major and medium irrigation schemes has increased
from 14.4% in 1965/66 to 20.5% in 1977/78. Unfortunately, separate data on
these two crops is not available for the major and medium schemes, but the
total sugarcane area in the State grew by 2.8% p.a. between 1967/68 and 1976/77;
assuming that most of this took place under surface irrigation, perhaps 2.0%
of the 12.2% growth rate of sugarcane related to sugarcane. That leaves at
least 10% growth rate for bananas. Given its relatively low yield in Gujarat,
the fact that the sugarcane area has grown at all seems surprising: field
observation and discussions suggest that as its growth has been concentrated
mainly in the Ukai-Kakrapar project, its success could be related to the
size of land-holdings and the fact that it is a "lazy man's crop": absentee
landlords can derive a significant revenue from t:he land with a very low
management input. This extensive sugarcane cultivation in areas of inadequate
drainage has led to severe water-logging problems, in Ukai-Kakrapar. As long
as the water supply from surface schemes is unreliable, and as long as far-
mers are not charged for water on a volumetric basis, then the proportion



49
Page 3
of the irrigated area under sugarcane is likely to remain constant or expand;
in view of Gujarat's acute shortage of stored water, and its comparative dis-
advantage in sugarcane production, this represents a significant wastage of
scarce resources,
6.        Bananas, on the other hand, show high yields, and the area under
this crop in major and medium schemes has grown at around 10% p.a.since
1965/66. As it is a particularly perishable crop, its share of the irrigated
cropping pattern will probably continue to expand rapidly until it has exhausted
the "transport possibilities", and it will then expand only in line with the
transport network. Demand of the crop is likey to expand rapidly, with
Ahmedabad, Surat, the industrial belt and Bombay being the principal markets.
Harvesting and marketing are well-developed.
7.        Other fruit:  mango, chiku, coconuts, pomegranates, guavas and
limes. Most of these fruit crops receive some irrigation. There is a short-
age of data on these crops, but there are indicators to suggest that the area
is expanding rapidly: the Department of Agriculture and private nurseries are
distributing planting material at a rate of some 5,000 ha per annum. Distribu-
tion and marketing is well organized in Cooperatives, at least one of which
has established a canning factory for mangoes. Demand for these crops is
likely to be very strong, from Gujarat, Bombay, all-India and even the Middle-
East.
Vegetables
8.        Although recent official data is lacking, all indicators show that
the production of vegetables has grown very rapidly over the last twenty years.
Between 1960/61 and 1973/74, potato production grew at an average annual rate
of 22%, and yields increased at 16% p.a. over the same period. Market authori-
ties consider that total vegetable production is growing by at lest 10% p.a.
In a largely vegetarian State, demand for these crops grows rapidly as incomes
rise; marketing is highly developed: many villages and cooperatives have
their own trucks for speedy delivery to Bombay. As these crops require frequent
and timely water deliveries, their share in the State's surface irrigated
cropping pattern is likely to increase only when water deliveries become more
reliable, and as the road network expands.
Condiments and Spices
9.        Condiments and spices are less perishable than fruit and vegetables,
but require almost as many waterings; their expansion will depend as much on
the reliability of the irrigation systems, but less on the development of the
transport network. However, they face the similarly buoyant demand conditions,
particularly with regard to the Middle-East, as their transportation cost is
relatively low.
Livestock and Dairy
10.       The easy access to Bombay will also be a major factor in the growth
or demand for these products. Dairy products and eggs, poultry and pigs is



50
ANNEX I
Page 4
likely to increase rapidly. The collection, processing and marketing of dairy
products is already highly developed. Hot weather fodder will therefore become
an increasingly important irrigated crop. The number of cows and buffalo has
grown over the last twenty years, but more importantly, the quantity of milk
sold has increased dramatically; before the ma:rketing channels were operating,
much milk wasted at the farm level.  GOG is also making efforts to improve the
varieties and the veterinary services. While vyegetarianism is strong in the
State, the demand for eggs will continue to grow rapidly; as the practice
declines, demand for poultry, pigs and fish--which is generally higher in
urban areas--will increase.
11.       The reliability of the irrigation supply is much more important
for high value cash crops than for most cereals. Thus, the projected future
cropping pattern requires a much more reliable supply than the cropping
pattern than exists at present. The likely shift in the cropping pattern
is also towards a greater variation in crops.
12.       The individual characteristics of futlire crops are difficult to
forecast.  However, the results of plant breeding and applied research over
the last two decades give a considerable insigh;: into the general trends for
the future. Those characteristics that are especially important for the
planning, design and operation of the irrigation systems are briefly dis-
cussed below.
13.       In the development of hybrids and HYVE, there has been an emphasis
on reducing the duration of the crop and significant reductions have been
achieved for sorghum and rice. It is likely that most crops will have a
shorter growing season in the future that t)ey have today. However, the peak
water requirements (measured in mm/day or m /ha/day) are basically the same.
If advantage is taken of the lower overall water requirements and a larger area
is planted, the peak water requirements for a project as a whole will go up.
Consequently, it is likely that the peak carrying capacity of the canal system
should be higher in the future than what it is at present; and that the manage-
ment of canal flows should be more systematic than at present.
14.       Data from Maharasthra gives an indication of how much the yield
of most irrigated crops is reduced if the planting date is delayed. 1/
The yield reduction for cotton and wheat illustrates the importance of
planting the crops at the optimum date:

Volume II, Annex 2, Tables l:a-l:c for summary of selected research results.

at the Wheat Research Station at Niphad.
This data would be applicable in areas of similar low rainfall in Gujarat,
although not so much in the high rainfall areas of the South.
15.       The magnitude of these reductions in yield implies that a delay
in planting of 15-30 days might turn an expected profit into a loss. Over
time when more research results become available and when these results have
been communicated to the farmers, there will be an increasing concentration
of the planting of crops around the optimum date. This implies that future
systems must be designed and operated in such a manner that farmers can plant
at the optimum time. The optimum planting dates will vary for the different
crops which, together with the trend towards a more complex cropping pattern,
require a much more flexible and complex operation of the irrigation systems;
no longer can the operation be based on rigid assumptions about irrigation
seasons.
16.       Irrigation water will become increasingly scarce in Gujarat in
the future. Research show that the number of irrigations often can be reduced
below the theoretical level without any significant yield decreases. Thus,
it is possible to increase total production by spreading the same amount of
water over a larger area. However, water stress during different stages of
crop growth has a very different impact on yield. Water stress during some
crop stages might have a neglible impact on the yield while the same water
deficiency might result in considerable impact on the yield while the
same water deficiency might result in considerable yield decreases if it
occurs at a critical stage of crop growth. Consequently, under irrigation
is acceptable only if the farmers can be assured of irrigation at the critical
times. This is not the case in the existing projects in Gujarat. However,
there will be a trend towards controlled underirrigation in the future. Thus,
combined with a shift towards more uniform planting dates, implies that the
operation of the system has to be more flexible and reliable.

GROUNDWATER RESOURCES
Regional Hydrogeology
1.        In detail, the geology of the area is complex and a wide variety of
rock types, ranging in age from Archaean-Pre-Camibrian through Mesozoic and
Tertiary to Quaternary, are represented. A simpler picture may be presented
for a regional description of the hydrogeology. Ancient crystalline rocks,
mainly granites and gneisses, outcrop adjacent t:o the north-eastern boundary
of the State with Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Predominantly extrusive rocks
of the Deccan trap series occur in most of the Saurashtra peninsular region
and in the southeastern part of the State, except for a coastal plain zone of
varying width where tertiary and quoternary sedimentary deposits are present.
Alluvial deposits underlie a broad belt of counl:ry through central Gujarat.
Kutch is a complex of Trap rocks, Mesozoic and Tertiary sediments and recent
alluvium. Hard rock varieties outcrop in about half the area of the State.
Phreatic aquifers form the most general sources of groundwater. However, a
number of important aquifers which are to some degree confined have been
developed. Water quality is generally good at hiigher elevation, but there
are extensive regfions of saline water in low lying areas adjacent to the
Gulfs of Cambay and Kutch and the Rans of Kutch.
Groundwater Balance Studies
2.        The GWRDC has prepared hydrogeological maps showing aquifer type and
water quality, and has drawn up balances for recharge and extraction on the
basis of talukas. Some 500 observation wells are annually monitored for water
level changes, measurements being made at the end of monsoon, at the end of
rabi and at the beginning of the monsoon. Special studies were also carried
out with UNDP assistance durjing 1971-74 in the marked overdraft area of
Mehesana. The taluka level studies are subject to continual updating. The
GWRDC has initiated village area (level) studies in the past two years in
specific areas where there is high level of groundwater exploitation.
3.        The GWRDC has used the following methodology Eor compiling water
balances.  Recharge from rainfall on alluvium (apart from low rainfall
areas) is compouted using a version of the Chaturvedi formula: I = 2 (R-15)
2/5, where I = infiltration (in inches) and R = mean annual rainfall (in
inches). As the formula is considered unapplicable in dry areas, recharge
is taken as 10% of the mean annual rainfall for such zones. Recharge on
hard rock aras are also taken as 10% of mean annual rainfall. Flow met
analysis to estimate underflow is used for confined aquifers. While the
Chaturvedi formula has been widely used in many States, it can give results
which are widely in error if it is used where rainfall, topographic, soil
and drainage conditions depart markedly from the area (part of Uttar Pradesh)
for which the empirical relationship was derived.



53
ANNEX 2
Page 2
4.        Deep percolation from surface water irrigation systems by seepage
losses from canal and tanks are accounted for b! applying an appropriate
seepage rate (typically 8 cusecs per million ft ) to the wetted surface
through the period that water is contained. On-field losses from surface
water irrigation are taken as 50% of the applied water.
5.        Return flows from pumped wells for irrigation are taken as 40%
of gross extraction, while return flows from manually operated irrigation
wells are taken as 20% of gross extraction.
6.        Uncontrollable losses of recharge to groundwater are taken as
10% of completed recharge. This is a particularly important element of the
water balance in hard rock areas with deeply incised natural drainage.
Uncontrollable losses on flat alluvial plains are generally less important
and could probably be completed eliminated with appropriate management.
A general figure for losses cannot therefore be given--each area must be
considered subjectively and any surface hydrology evidence reviewed before
assigning a proportion to such losses.
7.        The inventories of the various types of water points are obtained
mainly from the land records maintained by the State administration. Addi-
tional information has been obtained from the records of LDB, ID and the
Agriculture Department. The inventories were originally compiled at panchayat
and taluk level during the GWRDC groundwater surveys and have been subsequently
updated annually. Gross draft from groundwater are computed using the fol-
lowing norms:
Aneual Draft
(m x 1,000)
Dug wells in alluvium and hard rock                3.7
Dug wells in allulvium with pumpset               18.0

GWRDC tubewell                                   280.0
8.        In computing areas irrigated by the various types of water points,
the following norms for command areas were used:
Dug wells                                0.6 ha
Dug wells with pumpsets                  2.4 ha
Shallow tubewells                       20.0 ha
Deep tubewells                          60.0 ha

1/  Exponential trend, fitted through least square regression.
2/  1972/73 and 1974/75 were extreme drought years.  The low rainfall in these years not
only affected the yields but also the cropped area. Since these two drought years
occurred almost in sequence and towards the end of the time period, they might seriously
distort the regression results especially for the 1964/65-1978/79 time period. Thus, in
the "adjusted" time series, 1972/73 and 1974/75 have been excluded.
3/  t - values are given within parentheses.
* - indicates that the coefficient is significant at the 10% level for a two-tail test.
** - indicates that the coefficient is significant at the 1% level for a two-tail test.

2/ 1972/73 and 1974/75 were extreme drought years. The low rainfall in these years not
only affected the yields but also the cropped area. Since these two drought years
occurred almost in sequence and towards the end of the time period, they might seriously
distort the regression results especially for the 1964/65-1978/79 time period. Thus, in

1/ U/P%:  Utilization as a % of potential, probably over-estimated by 20-30%, but this factor varies significantly between schemes.
*Unlikely to be accurate
NOTE:  P = Potential created by the end of the previous year, i.e., that potential which is available for utilization in each year.
U = Utilization:  these figures were taken from the "Actual Irrigation by Major and Medium Irrigation Schemes" series, and not from the "Statement showing Irrigation Potential and
Utilization of Major and Medium Irrigation Projects in Gujarat State".  As these "actual irrigarion" figures are the result of a straight addition of the area irrigated in each
season (regardless of crop), whereas the "potential" figures are the result of adding the area irrigated ,,nder each crop over the entire year, the irrigated areas under two-seasonals
are double-counted, and those under perennials triple-counted, when making this comparison of potential and utilization.  Unfortunately, no more accurate data are available.
