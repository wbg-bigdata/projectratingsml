F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Development Financial Agreement)
To assist the Borrower in the economic and social reunification efforts thereby stabilizing
countrywide administration, through: (a) balance of payment support; (b) institutional
strengthening of entities and governance systems throughout its territory; (c) infrastructure and
urban rehabilitation; and (d) community empowerment. This statement of the PDO differs from

                                               vi
the statement of the PDO in the Technical Annex, which was: “To assist the Government in the
process of economic and social reunification?. The project’s specific objectives are three-fold: (i)
to help restore or introduce a sound economic governance system throughout the country; (ii) to
complement actions currently underway to address urgent needs in order to alleviate the suffering
of Congolese people and to generate quick “peace dividends?; and (iii) to prepare for the rapid
extension of the Emergency Multi-sector Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program (EMRRP)
to all parts of the country. The wording from the Development Financing Agreement (DFA) is
maintained for the purpose of this ICR because it is the legally binding agreement between the
Borrower and the Bank and the DFA objectives are more specific.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
To (i) assist the Borrower in its efforts to economically and socially reunify the Eastern provinces
to the rest of the country; and (ii) increase access to and use by the local population of basic
infrastructure and social services in the provinces of Orientale, Maniema, Nord Kivu, Sud Kivu,
Nord Equateur, Nord Katanga, Nord Kasai Oriental.

provinces) was governed by a variety of armed groups. The social fabric was severely damaged;
it was estimated that 3 million 1 people in the Eastern and Northern provinces (referred to as
reunified provinces) had died as a result of conflicts. Despite DRC’s enormous natural resources
and strategic position on the continent, the country’s decade of recurring conflicts had had
devastating effects in the country. The economy had nearly collapsed and the inflation rate was
at 511.2% in 2000 and at 135.2% in 2001; and the insecurity due to the widespread looting of
public and private assets had discouraged economic investments. Road networks had broken
down; infrastructure had suffered extensive damage as a consequence of the conflicts and the
interruption of maintenance. The main road network was not passable, leading to the isolation of
the Northern and Eastern provinces. The country’s institutions were in deep crisis after years of
conflicts, and public investment resources were being spent mostly on military activities. In the
reunified provinces, national authorities were not recognized as such by much of the population
and often had little respect from other representatives; criminal networks controlled certain areas.
Local authorities and institutions had lost technical capacity, equipment, and facilities. The
administration could not assure regular tax collection activities and civil works contractors have
disappeared. The Human Development Index declined; and DRC was ranked one of the lowest in
the HDI world, at number 167 of 175 UNDP-rated countries in 2003.
2.      Peace Process. The appointment of a transitional all-inclusive Government on June 30
2003 (with representation of armed groups, unarmed opposition, and civil society) was critical to
making peace and political reunification possible. Reconciliation efforts were showing results at
the time of appraisal and most of DRC was at peace although still in the “fog of war,? 2
particularly in the reunified provinces where the security situation was still very tense. A series of
agreements were signed by the different groups involved in the conflicts; and progress was made
toward peace, political reconciliation, and economic and social recovery.

3.      Reunification. Thanks to the Transitional Government and carefully structured reforms
supported by international donors, economic growth (3%) returned in 2003. However, the
sustainability of political reunification required not only an economic and social reunification
process, but also a territorial reintegration under a single national authority. Although
reconstruction needs were massive, the attempts to speed up delivery of infrastructure and
services and to provide peace dividends to the population were hampered by large scale
insecurity; lack of technical capacities; a dearth of information on costs of materials and works;
and poor information on the state of existing infrastructure and social services in the reunified
provinces.

4.       Government. The Transitional Government strategy had a two-fold agenda in order to
facilitate the economic and social reunification of the country, namely: (i) to ensure key economic
reforms throughout the country (such as fiscal mobilization, transparency in the management of
public resources, public expenditure management, exploitation of natural resources, and financial
sector reforms); and (ii) to restore reunification as well as supporting key institutions .

5.       Bank support. The World Bank re-engagement in DRC came after the country went
through a long and protracted period of instability by supporting both the Government’s national
strategy and the process of social and economic reunification. The World Bank through the
Transitional Support Strategy (TSS-2001) identified the main activities needed to assure the
transition to peace and stability in DRC and in the sub-regions which were related to the
rehabilitation of key infrastructure, the strengthening of institutions, and the increase of capacity
in the areas of management and good governance. The World Bank also supported the
international donor agenda which aimed at restoring sound economic management, good
governance; mitigating the fiscal cost of reunification; and supporting the rehabilitation of
essential infrastructure and the restoration of social services in the Eastern and Northern
provinces. With the Emergency Economic and Social Reunification Support Project (PUSPRES),
the Bank was able to commit substantial resources by contributing to the stabilization of the
economy and the social fabric in the Eastern and Northern provinces.. The Bank was already
engaged in previous operations like the IDA-funded Emergency Stabilization Recovery Project
(ESRP- 2001) and the Emergency Multi-sector Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project
(EMRRP- 2002), which were instrumental in providing assistance to meet the most basic and
urgent needs of the population and to strengthen public institutions in countrywide programs, in
areas where the security situation made it possible to supervise activities.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

6.       The original PDO were stated in the Development Financing Agreement (DFA-
September 22, 2003) in this way: “To assist the Borrower in its economic and social reunification
efforts thereby stabilizing countrywide administration, through (a) balance of payment support;
(b) institutional strengthening of entities and governance systems throughout its territory; (c)
infrastructure and urban rehabilitation; and (d) community empowerment.? 3
The key performance indicators would measure (Development Financing Agreement):
(i) the implementation of the key reforms in three areas: (a) the adoption of PRSP; (b) the new
    forestry concessions (at least 10) to be awarded pursuant to the regular procedures as per the
    2002 forestry code; and (c) the mobilization of fiscal revenues from reunified provinces;
(ii) the possible average speed for a vehicle traveling on the sections of RN2 and RN4
     rehabilitated under the project, which, by March 31, 2008, should be at least 25 kilometers
     per hour;
(iii) the ownership and maintenance obligations for at least 80% of all work carried out in urban
      rehabilitation activities being transferred to beneficiaries, and the number (at least 8) of
      urban centers in which such activities were implemented;
(iv) the number (at least 500) of eligible communities which, by March 31, 2008, had benefited
    from micro-grants.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

7.       The PUSPRES restructuring was approved by the Board on August 21, 2008. The main
reasons for restructuring were (i) to address the lack of clarity of the original PDOs and the lack of
consistency between the PDOs and the related indicators; (ii) to recognize that an emergency
operation could not address the important forestry issues in DRC; (iii) to review the scope of some
of the project components considering the cost overruns associated with the road works; and (iv) to
develop a better results framework more aligned with the PDOs in order to better capture
achievements that were taking place on the ground. The revised PDO aimed (i) to assist the
Borrower in the economic and social reunification of the Eastern provinces with the rest of the
country; and (ii) to increase access to and use by the local population of basic infrastructure and
social services in the provinces of Orientale, Maniema, Nord Kivu, Sud Kivu, Nord Equateur, Nord
Katanga, and Nord Kasai Oriental.

8.        Revised Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). KPIs were redefined to reflect the
reduced scope of the project and were focused with more specific, measurable, attributable,
relevant and time-bound indicators. A particular focus was given to providing a baseline and
targeted value for each outcome in the revised results framework. The original framework didn’t
have baseline data and targets were poorly described and many of the indicators were output
indicators. New outcome indicators were established: (i) number of people in the previously
isolated provinces having access to the 217 km of rehabilitated sections of RN2 and the 750 km
of RN4; (ii) increased percentage of fiscal revenues collected in the reunified provinces; (iii)
increased access to water supply in areas benefiting from water services; (iv) increased access to
health facilities in selected communities (urban centers); (v) increased access to improved school
facilities in selected communities; (vi) reduction in the percentage of learning time loss due to
bad weather at selected schools; (vii) number of communities successfully implementing projects
in the isolated rural areas. The project closed on March 31, 2011; hence the relevant ISR is #17 4.
- see point 2.5).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

9.       The project was intended to primarily benefit those living in the Eastern and Northern
provinces of the country (i) the urban populations of the four main cities (Bukavu, Goma, Kindu
and Kisangani representing a total population of two million inhabitants) and the eight smaller
cities (Bumba, Butembo, Isiro, Kalémie, Kalina, Kasongo, Lusambo, and Uvira with a total
population of one million inhabitants) would benefit from the rehabilitation of roads, schools,
health facilities, sports facilities, markets, and water, energy, sewage and drainage networks; and
(ii) the populations living in isolated villages, such as Buta, Gemena, Isiro, Kibombo, Lodja, and
Masisi, would benefit from sub-grants to support infrastructure, service delivery, and local
economic development activities. National institutions and their decentralized branches, such as
Banque Centrale du Congo (BCC), Direction Générale des Impôts (DGI), Direction Générale de
Douanes et des Assises (DGDA), Office des Douanes et des Assises (OFIDA), Direction
Générale des Recettes Administratives et domaniales (DGRAD), Ministry of Environment,


4
  The ICR team did not consider in its assessment the last ISR (#18) of March 31, 2011, which reflected changes made
to the project Results Framework, because it was introduced at project closing as part of the restructuring of the
Emergency Living Conditions Improvement Support Project (PUAACV: see point 2.5). The major changes in the last
framework (reflected in ISR#18) concerned the alignment with corporate core indicators, which had been integrated in
all IDA projects as complementary indicators.


                                                         3
National Assembly, and Office des Routes, would benefit through the provision of capacity
building, technical support, equipment, materials, and rehabilitated buildings; and the support for
stabilization of the Borrower’s countrywide administration. On a broader scale, both the country
as a whole and the reunified provinces would benefit thanks to (i) the reunification process;
which will bring more cohesion (ii) the economic reforms which will spur more economic growth
with spillover impacts; (iii) substantial reduction in the cost of transportation for the majority of
the population in addition to time reduction regarding the movement of people and goods to and
from reunified provinces; and (iv) better procurement of goods, services and works which will
reduce costs, increase spending efficiency and transparency.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

10.     The project as presented in the Development Financing Agreement document had five
main components:
(Total: appraisal/actual cost: US$214/ US$228.7 million) 5

Component A – Balance of Payment Support (Appraisal/actual cost: US$50/US$52.7 million)
This component aimed to help the Government face the fiscal shock associated with reunification
and with financing critical imports on a positive list (See Annex 2) necessary for the recovery.
The component was implemented by the Ministry of Finance.
Component B – Institutional Strengthening (Appraisal/actual cost: US$15/US$14.39 million)
This component aimed at (i) establishing a sound economic governance system and carrying out
economic reforms including improving revenue generation capacity, public expenditure
management, transparency of government actions in all sectors, and public dissemination of
knowledge of and participation in economic reforms, through the provision of technical advisory
services, training, and acquisition of equipment; (ii) assisting in the Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP) process; (iii) strengthening the forestry management agencies and enhancement of
local governance of natural resources, including preparation of national forest zoning plan and
developing the administration’s capacity in the provision of forestry services; (iv) development
and implementation of strategies and action plans for effective reunification of the Borrower’s
public institutions, through the provision of technical services and training; and (v) carrying out
engineering and other studies to prepare for an extension for the EMRRP. The implementing
agency for this component was UCoP.
Component C – Infrastructure Rehabilitation (Appraisal/actual cost: US$90/US$113.28
million)
This component aimed at (i) rehabilitating and maintaining (for a two-year period) of RN2 (750
km, Bukavu-Mbuji Mayi) and RN4 (780 km, Kisangani-Beni), including rehabilitation of bridges
and damaged sections; and (ii) rehabilitation of a 10 km section of RN1, including patching,
backfilling, cleaning of ditches, and maintenance of shoulders. This component was implemented
by UCoP with BCECO as the procurement agent.
Component D – Urban Rehabilitation (Appraisal/actual cost: US$30 /US$32.2 million)
This component aimed to provide micro-grants to finance subprojects including local
infrastructure and service delivery in urban areas located in reunified provinces in (i) the main
cities of Bukavu, Goma, Kindu, and Kisangani; and (ii) the small cities of Bumba, Butembo, Isiro,
Kalémie, Kalima, Kassongo, Lusambo, and Uvira. The component was implemented by a

consulting firm (the Urban Rehabilitation Management Firm) through a service contract with the
government.
Component E – Community Empowerment (Appraisal/actual cost: US$10 /US$9.7 million)
This component aimed at providing demand-based micro-grants to finance subprojects in very
remote and isolated communities in small villages like Buta, Gemema, Isiro, Kibombo, Lodja and
Masisi. Most of the sub-projects were related to infrastructure repairs, development of community
assets, provision of agricultural inputs and tools, establishment of revolving funds, provision of
social services, and provision of technical advisory services and training. These activities were
implemented by private companies or NGOs.

1.6 Revised Components

11.      The following changes were made after the Amendment of the Development Financial
Agreement: (i) the forest subcomponent of Component B (strengthening the forestry management
agencies) was dropped, given the difficulty of managing a forestry component which calls for
highly participatory arrangements and therefore very time consuming into an emergency
operation; and (ii) the scope of works for Component C (rehabilitation of RN2 Bukavu-Mbuji-
Mayi) was reduced due to cost overruns. Due to road construction costs higher than anticipated,
the road maintenance activities were dropped.. In fact, project components were not revised and
the five components were not relabeled after the restructuring (see Annex 9). It is worth noting
that the government committed itself to taking charge of the rehabilitation of the section of RN2
that could not be financed under PUSPRES through the DRC-China Infrastructure Program.
However, this commitment has not yet materialized because discussions between the Chinese and
Congolese governments are still ongoing to finalize the financing of these works..

1.7 Other significant changes

12.     Extension of Closing Date. The credit closing date was extended twice. The first
extension was from September 30, 2008 to September 30, 2010 as part of the restructuring; the
second, to March, 2011 (made in the September, 2010 revision). In both cases, these decisions
were made to allow for the continuation of the implementation of project activities, because of
implementation delays in infrastructure rehabilitation, urban rehabilitation, and community
empowerment components due to logistical challenges faced by contractors and service providers
in some of the most isolated areas of this vast territory. For example, it takes more than six
months to get heavy equipment for road works in Kisangani.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

13.      Preparation. PUSPRES was prepared in response to requests from the Government and
other international donors to help with the reintegration of the Eastern and Northern regions. This
reunification was absolutely critical to start unleashing some of the economic potential of the
country and to the healing process of a country traumatized by years of bloody wars. This was a
strong rationale for the Bank to intervene. Preparation of the project took place following the
Paris donor meeting of December, 2002 and the installation of the Transitional Government (June,
2003) which main mandate was to restore peace. It took six months to prepare the operation
within the framework of the Transitional Support Strategy (TSS). The design of PUSPRES was




                                                5
based on some of the lessons learned from previous post-conflict projects and early interventions
in DRC. 6 There was no Quality Assurance Group review of the project. During preparation and
implementation the Borrower efficiently performed its role of coordination and support of project
activities through the Inter-Ministerial Committee (CIS 7).

14.      Design. The overall PDO was highly relevant focusing on the reunification of the country
after years of wars which ended in the split of DRC territories, particularly the Eastern and
Northern Provinces from the rest of the country and as a result didn’t benefit from the financing
of existing projects. By directly financing activities aimed at the rehabilitation of the main
infrastructures and the water and energy systems, and by addressing the physical isolation and the
lack of access to infrastructure and basic services, the project aimed to address both widespread
poverty and economic and social reunification. Reducing poverty through the project was likely
to have a positive impact in minimizing the possibility of renewed conflicts. Poor institutional
management was among the deep-rooted causes of ineffectiveness of the Government and thus
was among key issues that the project aimed to mitigate. Given the weak institutions and scarce
human resources in post-conflict DRC, a project with a multiple sector approach was a relevant
response for emergency assistance to have a substantial impact on growth prospects and social
stability in a highly-disrupted environment. The various components may have seemed unrelated
but in fact they targeted the sectors mostly in need of interventions. The project design was
ambitious and complex in scope and in terms of implementation arrangements considering its
multi-sectoral approach in a post conflict environment characterized by extremely weak capacity.
While some of the activities were more appropriate to long term involvement and required more
time to implement like the forestry sub-component, which was later dropped from the project,
others like activities under Component E were demand-driven in order and consistent with the
specific needs of the poor populations living in isolated areas. In that respect, the use of
beneficiary participation in the selection of activities was the right decision in designing this
component. One of the key features of the design of the project was the multiplicity of
implementation mechanisms all aligned with the conditions on the ground. Some of these
arrangements included the use of UN agencies, churches, NGOs, local contractors and the use of
private operators to deliver works, goods and services. These arrangements appear to be strong
and were effective in implementing the project despite the large geographic scope of the project
and the many activities to be carried out. The project was nevertheless affected by delays but
these delays were linked to the lack of knowledge of Bank procedures.

15.     Looking at the results and with the hindsight, PUSPRES was really a high-risk, high-
reward operation. One of the weaknesses of the project was the poor mitigation measures built
into the operation to address the poor functioning of the market for civil works, goods and
services and not factoring the logistical challenges and the high risk premium associated with
working in DRC in general and in these remote areas of the country in particular. The Technical
Annex listed a number of well-identified risks to be addressed in PUSPRES; however, there were
some weaknesses in the analysis. It may have been unrealistic to assume that the risks “resulting
from the absence of a functioning market for many goods and services in some reunified
provinces? could be mitigated during the first stages of project implementation, which were
aimed at stabilizing prices for materials essential for rehabilitation activities and income-
generating activities. The institutional arrangement for implementation was based on the



6
    Specifically, that (i) multi-sector approaches are needed for emergency projects to have a substantial impact; and (ii)
early intervention is critical to help stabilize fragile political and social situations in difficult post-conflict environments.

delegation of as many implementation responsibilities as possible; this arrangement was based on
previous experiences in post-conflict projects. Given the diversity of operations, their
fragmentation, and their dissemination on a large number of sites, three main entities were
involved in the overall implementation: UCoP (Project Coordination Unit), which was in charge
of the overall oversight of the project; CIS, the Inter-Ministerial committee, which assured the
coordination between sector ministries; and BCECO (Bureau Central de Coordination), which
acted as a procurement agent for all contracts to be awarded by the Government.

16.      Quality at Entry. The project clearly targeted the right beneficiaries from the beginning
and project components were appropriately selected in order to respond to the most pressing
needs that could help the country in its reunification process. The institutional arrangements
developed by the project were flexible and comprehensive enough to respond to the variety of
situations the country was experiencing. In spite of all these positive features embedded in the
design of this operation, there were shortcomings in the assessments of implementation capacity,
not all the major risks were properly evaluated and the cost of infrastructure rehabilitation was
underestimated. It could also be noted that the component related to balance of payment support
did not include activities that could allow for the transfer of resources to the reunified provinces
as expected.. In addition, the original PDO of PUSPRES was too general making it almost
impossible to directly correlate project results and objectives. This situation was in part due to the
post-conflict nature at the time of preparation, the need to respond quickly to the emergency
needs of the population, compounded by the poor security conditions on the ground which
precluded the preparation team to visit the respective locations. The absence of reliable data due
to a weak statistical system, particularly concerning rehabilitation costs and the status of
infrastructures and services didn’t help. These conditions were inadequate to set up a strong M&E
system and to evaluate the cost of road rehabilitation. The 2008 Amendment of the DFA
corrected these insufficiencies.

2.2 Implementation

17.       The implementation of the project was faced with multiple challenges due to:
(i) huge logistical problems encountered in moving heavy equipment, and acquiring goods and
construction materials.
(ii) the remote location of project sites (some accessible only by air), the size of the country, and
the geographic spread of subprojects and lack of passable roads made construction works very
difficult to carry out in a timely manner. The country, located in the middle of Africa, is the
second largest country in Africa by area (2.3 million square kilometers) and the eleventh largest
in the world and the fourth most populous nation in the continent. The bulk of DRC’s territory is
inaccessible. As a result, communication between the provincial capitals and other provincial
centers as well as access to rural areas is often not possible.
(iii) weak supervisory capacity from executing agencies in managing big contracts as the first
ones were awarded in 2002-2003, one year after the end of fifteen years of war.
(iv) cost overruns due to the lack of detailed technical studies as a result of the poor security
conditions prevailing in the eastern part of the country during project preparation.
(v) weak local capacity in civil engineering activities due to the fact that companies had not done
any significant works during the fifteen years of conflict.
(vi) insecurity that persisted in reunified provinces until January, 2009.




                                                  7
Despite the magnitude and the diversity of the difficulties on the ground, UCoP did a great job
handling these problems with the support of the Bank team in a manner 8 that helped achieve
project outcomes.

18.      Improving environmental and social aspects of the project. In December, 2005, a
complaint was lodged with the Bank’s Inspection Panel claiming that PUSPRES failed to comply
with Bank policies regarding indigenous people, environmental assessment, and forestry related
safeguards. The Inspection Panel launched an investigation and as a result an Action Plan was
defined and implemented. Four main actions were identified and carried out: (i) improving and
scaling up work in the Africa region on safeguards; (ii) scaling up the work on indigenous people
in DRC; (iii) supporting the forest policy reform agenda in DRC; and (iv) improving outreach and
communication. Regular reports were prepared and presented to the Board to detail progress
made in implementing the Action Plan. The first report was submitted in March, 2009, and the
last report in March, 2011. Following the Inspection Panel, the environmental and social aspects
of project implementation greatly improved and national capacity to manage safeguards issues
was increased. These aspects are discussed in more detail in Section 2.4, Safeguards and
Fiduciary Compliance.

19.     Delays in resolution of consulting firm performances. The Mid-Term Review (MTR) in
November, 2006, was used to point out delays in implementing road and urban rehabilitation
components. In particular, the poor performance of (i) the consulting firm hired under
Component D to implement a subcomponent for small cities resulted in the non-renewal of the
contract; UNOPS took over the contract (see below, Agencies’ Performance); and (ii) the
contractor hired under Component C to implement the rehabilitation of the Mbuji-Mayi–
Kasongo road, had its contract terminated due to poor performance. It took time to resolve these
unsatisfactory firm performances, but in the end these decisions gave a better visibility to the
project and sent a clear signal to companies involved in the delivery of some of the contracts that
performance was critical.

20.      Project Restructuring. The 2008 restructuring was used to revise the PDO and the results
framework. Previous indicators only measured outputs and did not include indicators to measure
the impact of some of the major road rehabilitation activities financed by the project. The main
reasons for the restructuring were (i) to redefine the PDO and to have it more aligned with the
project’s components; (ii) the recognition that an emergency operation could not address the
important forestry issues in DRC; and (iii) to address the cost overruns associated with road
works on RN4 (Kisangani-Beni) and on RN2 (Bukavu-Mbuji-Mayi). Cost overruns were
identified later on with the preparation of detailed technical studies after security conditions were
restored in the project implementation areas and costs of roads were reevaluated9. The number of
kilometers to be rehabilitated was reduced from the initial 1,779 km to 976 km 10. Shortcomings in
the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework were addressed after UCoP hired a consultant
to help strengthen the M&E functions.. At the time of restructuring, three out the five results
indicators had been achieved (see Annex 9); 75% (100% of the credit and 68% of the grant) of
the total amount had been disbursed and performance was rated satisfactory. Positive impacts
were already visible on the ground before the restructuring. It is worth mentioning that the
restructuring could have taken place earlier.

  Costs of the roads were reevaluated at US$90,000/km for RN4 and at US$192,000/km for RN2, instead of the

21.      Preparing post-completion operation. During implementation, new activities linked to
the implementation of the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and the extension of water supply to
extend benefits to a larger number of inhabitants was identified. Further to the October 2010
supervision mission, Bank management concluded that additional financing to cover the
financing gap (due in particular to the identification of new needed activities and to the
fluctuation of the US$ against the SDR) 11 was not the best solution. After exploring other options
with the Government, the Bank agreed to finance remaining activities under the restructured
PUAACV which has objectives similar to those of PUSPRES but was being implemented in
other geographic areas. The fact that PUAACV was supervised by the same Bank team makes it
more likely that the remaining PUSPRES activities will be implemented and as a result
PUSPRES was then closed as expected in March 2011 (see 2.5, Post-completion Operation/Next
Phase).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

22.      Design. The project design was weak on M&E. It was difficult to link the original PDO
to the results. One of the M&E framework flaws was the lack of methodology to measure the
macro-economic achievement of Component A. The PUSPRES M&E framework reflects the
difficulty of designing a framework in a post-conflict environment without any data base or
reliable information regarding the sites of the intervention.

23.      Implementation. The project team worked closely with UCoP to set up an adequate
M&E system. During the 2008 restructuring, baseline and target values for each result indicator
were added and five new intermediate result indicators, based on detailed technical studies carried
out in the field, were introduced. This modification allowed better accounting of the impact of the
project. Nevertheless, it is important to point out that this early lack of an adequate M&E system
did not facilitate measuring the success in achieving the PDO during the implementation period
preceding restructuring.

24.     Utilization. This restructuring allowed the review of indicators and the establishment of a
strong M&E framework. Surveys were underway and M&E data were collected allowing UCoP
to measure project performance. Most of the M&E data were collected after restructuring, when
most of the activities had been prepared or implemented.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

25.     Overall safeguard compliance is rated Satisfactory. The safeguard category is B because
no activity funded under PUSPRES was expected to have a significant environmental or social
impact (Environmental aspects and compliance with Bank safeguard policies, Technical Annex,
page 57) despite the fact that many policies were triggered. It was noted that work would be
focused on rehabilitation of existing infrastructures (no new construction). Six World Bank
safeguard policies were triggered during project preparation and the pertinent mitigation
measures were identified. In accordance with emergency lending policies (OP8.50, Emergency
Recovery Assistance), the safeguard documentation was to be prepared during implementation,
and no later than six months after credit effectiveness.

26.      Before the project was restructured in 2008, Component B included support for the
institutional strengthening of forestry management agencies, including preparation of a national
forest zoning plan and the development of the administration’s capacity in the provision of
forestry services. In 2005, the project was one of two 12 subject to an Inspection Panel request
submitted by organizations representing indigenous pygmy groups. The requestors were
concerned with the implementation of a new commercial forest concession system and the
preparation of a forest zoning plan for the forests of the Equateur and Orientale Provinces,
claiming that harm would be caused if the projects were implemented without consulting the
indigenous peoples and considering their interests. In investigating these claims, the Inspection
Panel identified some major risks associated with the project, including (i) indigenous
populations living along the planned rehabilitated roads, (ii) lack of environmental assessment,
and (iii) potential impacts on the Okapi Wildlife Reserve. In response, Bank management stated
in its report and recommendations that it agreed that an Environmental Assessment should have
been prepared, and proposed an Action Plan to better monitor and manage environmental and
social risks.

27.      As an element of this Action Plan, an environmental and social program was
implemented and monitored through the following approved and disclosed mitigation
instruments: (i) Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for Component C (ii) the
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) for Components D and E, (iii) the
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and; (iv) the Indigenous People Plan (IPP). These
safeguards documents were used by the project and by other institutions. The implementation of
the Action Plan for the indigenous people has significantly helped the affected indigenous pygmy
groups by improving their general living conditions while respecting their socio-cultural
specificities.

28.      The preparation and implementation of the environmental and social program developed
significant safeguards management capacity in the project implementation unit (UCoP),
contributing to the creation of a cadre of government staff who are now well equipped to ensure
the effective application of Bank safeguard requirements. As a result of the heightened attention
to safeguards issues and to address the importance of forestry in the DRC, the Bank subsequently
financed a large forestry project which is still under implementation.

29.     The RN2 road in Bukavu has been rehabilitated by the project. Although no displacement
or asset losses occurred as a result of the rehabilitation, risks to pedestrians still remain at the
entrances and exits of Bukavu and Kamituga where the existing right-of-ways have not been
enlarged enough. To correct these situations, the recipient has prepared an Ex-Post RAP. The
RAP was completed, reviewed, and cleared on August 3, 2010 13, and is being implemented under
PUAACV, which is managed by the same implementing unit and the same Bank team that
supervised PUSPRES..

30.     Procurement and financial management are rated Satisfactory. The project complied with
the Bank fiduciary safeguards. Audit reports and interim financial reports (IFRs) were submitted
to the Bank on time and there were no overdue audit reports and IFRs at the time of the project
closing date. The last audit report covering the period ending on May 31, 2011, is due on
September 30, 2011. All audit reports and IFRs were reviewed by the Bank and comments
provided to the Government. The main FM issue raised was the status of the advance payment of

US$3,202,838 to the company with the cancelled contract on RN2 14 (Mbuji-Mayi–Kasongo road
contract). The contract has been terminated and is pending arbitration at the International
Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in Paris between the company and DRC. The Bank has asked the
government to reimburse the advance. According to the terms of the contract the government can
at any time recall the warranty at the level of the issuing bank.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

31.     PUAACV was restructured simultaneously with the closing of PUSPRES on March 31,
2011, in order to respond to the changing needs of the client during implementation of these IDA
projects, to ensure the continuation and follow-up of PUSPRES activities 15, and to reinforce the
impact of the investments made.

32.     PUSPRES supported through Component B, institutional strengthening and capacity
building activities reinforcing the sustainability of investments. Rehabilitation of public buildings
created ripple effects on the involvement in management and maintenance of other donors such as
Médecins sans Frontières, and Cooperation Technique Belge (CTB). Activities financed under
Component E should in principle be self-sustaining, given that the investments went to organized
communities. Most of the schools and health facilities rehabilitated by the project have
committees to ensure regular maintenance. Contributions from these committees will only cover
50% of the total needs of hospitals and health centers; the remaining financing is expected to be
provided by the government, which may be problematic. This is a serious issue that should be
monitored to ensure that built facilities are maintained and provide the expected services over
time.

33.      The Forest and Nature Conservation Project (FNCP), which was funded by IDA and the
Global Environment Facility (GEF) grants of US$64 million and US$6 million respectively, and
became effective in September, 2009, has taken on a number of the tasks originally planned under
PUSPRES, such as the development of participatory forest zoning plans. It has also supported
the government in the completion of the final stages of the legal review of forest concessions,
including the evaluation of the sixteen concessions that were the subject of “special observations?
by the legal review commission and the publication of the final outcomes of the review. FNCP is
funding forest information and timber tracking systems that are enabling the government to
improve the control of illegal logging. It also funds three international nature conservation NGOs
to develop alternative income-generating activities in four large landscapes, to reduce the reliance
of local communities and indigenous people on the hunting of protected wildlife species and other
illegal activities.

34.     The government has committed (after closing PUSPRES) to asphalting the RN4 road; 60
km of the total has already been asphalted. However, road maintenance represents a problem due
to the current inability of the Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) to cover all the needs of the road
maintenance program. The Bank will finance, through the PRO-routes 16 Project with the RMF,
the maintenance of RN4 over a four-year period, through an Output and performance-based road
maintenance contract. During this time, road fund resources are expected to increase substantially
enough to support road maintenance programs and maintain the effective operation of the RMF.
The rehabilitated Ruzizi 1 Power Plant was transferred to SNEL (Société Nationale d’Electricité),

but due to the weakness of this national institution, sustainability of this investment is
questionable. Under the Regional and Domestic Power Markets Development Project (PMEDE),
and as part of a project to construct the Ruzizi 3 hydropower stations, donors are considering a
separate institutional setup, which will include private sector participation, to manage Ruzizi 1, 2,
and 3 power stations. In addition, it is worth noting that the Government and the Bank have
decided to move from emergency projects to sectoral projects. In this regard, the ongoing projects,
Health Sector Rehabilitation Project (US$150 million, effective April, 2007); the Education
Sector project (US$150 million, effective January, 2008); and the Urban Water Supply Project 17
(US$190 million, effective November 2009) are paving the way for sustained access to basic
services and address somehow the sustainability requirements of these basic services.

35.      In order to address development of indigenous pygmy groups in DRC, in a more strategic
manner, the Bank has supported the realization of a Strategic Framework for the Preparation of an
Indigenous People Development Program, which was completed in December, 2009. The
strategic framework rests now with the Government and the Bank management in DRC stated on
several occasions its willingness to support further concrete actions if the government makes a
request in that sense.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

36.      The objectives remain highly relevant and reflect proper diagnosis of development
priorities, which also remain relevant. The project objectives and design were consistent with the
2001 Transitional Support Strategy (TSS), which clearly identified major areas of intervention: (i)
meet basic and urgent needs; (ii) rebuild effective public institutions and policies; (iii) revitalize
economic activity; and (iv) rebuild implementation capacity. Although essential infrastructures
have been rehabilitated in the Northern and Eastern provinces, infrastructures and service
demands are still huge. Improving living conditions and economic recovery continue to be
relevant in a country where 70 percent of the population are poor. Some 9,000 km of high priority
earth roads are still closed to motorized traffic and access to basic services is among the lowest in
Sub-Sahara Africa: 9 percent for electricity and 22 percent for water compared to 60 percent on
average in Sub-Saharan countries. The PDOs were, and still remain, relevant to DRC’s
development needs, as indicated in the two pillars of the PRSP (July 2006): (i) improving
governance and consolidating peace and security; and (ii) improving access to social services and
reducing vulnerability. This was endorsed by the latest Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
of December18, 2007, which is derived from the PRSP and actions proposed under the CAS are
closely aligned with PRSP priorities. The 2008 Board-level restructuring ensured continued
relevance of the project to the prevailing environment.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Satisfactory

37.     The Project Development Objectives were: (i) to assist the Borrower in the economic
and social reunification of the Eastern provinces with the rest of the country; and (ii) to increase
access to and use by the local population of basic infrastructure and social services in the
provinces of Orientale, Maniema, Nord Kivu, Sud Kivu, Nord Equateur, Nord Katanga, and Nord

Kasai Oriental. The following section assesses achievement for the various dimensions of the
PDOs.

PDO 1: Assisting in the social and economic reunification of Eastern and Northern provinces
with the rest of the country by allowing people in the previous isolated areas to have access to
roads:

This objective has been met and even surpassed.

a) Thanks to the rehabilitation of the sections of roads RN2 and RN4, secluded inhabitants from
   the eastern and northern parts of the country can now travel by car for the first time since
   1998 when only bicycles and motorcycles could be used. A population estimated at 8.8
   million has access to roads compared to the target of 6 million. The re-establishment of the
   main arterial roads and their link to the river networks have enabled the physical
   reunification of the country. The cost of transportation of goods and persons via the
   rehabilitated roads fell by 60%; and the RN4 re-opening provided an alternative to air
   transportation between Kisangani and Beni, reducing drastically the cost of transportation.
   The average travel speed has been exceeded, to 70 km/hour, compared to the anticipated
   25km/h.

b) Increasing percentage of fiscal revenues collected in the reunified provinces: Overall, annual
   tax collection improved by 368% 18, from 18.5 billion CF (Congolese Francs) in 2004 to 87.7
   billion CF in 2011. The key indicator of commitment rate of a 50% increase in fiscal
   revenues collected was exceeded.

PDO 2: Increasing access to and use by the local population of basic infrastructure and social
services in the provinces of Orientale, Maniema, Nord Kivu, Sud Kivu, Nord Equateur, Nord
Katanga, and Nord Kasai Oriental:

This objective has been met.

c) Increasing access to water supply in areas benefiting from water: the percentage of
   population benefiting from water supply rehabilitation increased from 39% to 48% (43%
   achievement of the target of 60% of the total population). However, activities in the water
   sector have led to important improvements in health in Isiro: the number of cases of diseases
   related to water quality has decreased from 8,633 to 1,665. REGIDESO reduced water
   leakage by 20% through the replacement of parts of drinking water pipes in Goma, Kindu,
   and Bukavu. Number of inhabitants that benefitted: 187,000.

d) Increasing access to health facilities in selected communities (urban centers): The percentage
   of number of people using the health centers rehabilitated (in urban centers) rose from 50% in
   2003 to 70% at the closing date, achieving the outcome indicator. The attendance at health
   centers doubled in Kindu (from 17 to 37 thousand) and Bukavu (from 90 to 180 thousand).
   The occupancy rate in hospitals in Kisangani and Bukavu rose from 56% to 89% and from
   zero occupancy to 70% respectively. Number of inhabitants that benefitted from access to
   basic package of health or population services: 1,025,000 people.

                                                      13
e) Increasing access to improved school facilities in selected communities: The number of
   pupils that benefitted from increased school facilities is 70,000 19.

f) Reducing the rate of school days lost because of the weather: The rate was reduced from 30%
   to 0% (achieving this outcome indicator) in rehabilitated schools. In the nine schools
   rehabilitated in Goma, Bukavu, Kindu, and Kisangani, the number of students increased by
   23%.

g) Involving a number of communities to successfully implement projects in the isolated rural
   areas: There were 1747 micro-projects carried out by 1467 communities in rural cities,
   exceeding the target of 500 communities anticipated. The main impacts of this component
   are 20 (i) a significant decrease in diseases related to water quality; (ii) increased agricultural
   land per household (average increases between 67% and 406%); (iii) increased fish
   production (average increases of over 100% in Isiro, 300% in Masisi, 655% in Kibombo, and
   718% in Buta); (iv) increased livestock numbers (average increases from 100% to 2088% in
   Isiro and Kibombo). Rehabilitated health center statistics show a significant reduction in
   diseases related to water quality in all areas, with an average reduction from 78% to 40% in
   Buta and Lodja. Details are provided in Annex 2. In the water sector, 160,500 people have
   access to improved water sources. 49,000 people have seen their learning conditions
   improved and 70,000 have access to improved health centers.

 h) Economic impacts: The balance of payment support was provided within the program
    supported by the Bretton Woods institutions; the whole program had an immediate impact.
    The current account balance improved from US$97.8 million (December, 2003) to
    US$147.7 million in the first quarter of 2004 (representing 3.58 weeks of national imports).
    This disbursing component, with the flexibility to act quickly, helped to increase the
    international reserves, to reduce the fiscal deficit, to fight against speculation, and to assure
    the importation of essential items to support the recovery of the economy. The volume of
    importation grew by 16% during 2004 in the first half of the year. The positive list of
    imports included essential products such as gasoline, fuel, and foods needed in a post-
    conflict environment.

3.3 Efficiency

38.     The project was prepared under the Bank’s Operational Policies 8.50-Emergency
Operation; there was no ex-ante formal economic and financial analysis, and no indicators of
efficiency were provided by the project. However, project performance indicators can be found in
order to evaluate efficiency in terms of cost effectiveness.

39.      Cost/efficiency. Although difficult conditions existed during implementation of the
project, unit costs of the main project work remained within acceptable limits and therefore the
project largely meets the efficiency criterion. While there is a dearth of reliable data on similar
work conducted in DRC, meaningful comparisons can be made to other projects in countries in
sub-Saharan Africa, with the constraint that work in DRC was done in an extremely difficult
environment. The rehabilitation of the RN4 was completed with a unit cost of US$92,000/km,
which is comparable to the costs charged in Mali (US$80,000). The cost of the rehabilitation of

   The value of this indicator was omitted on the restructuring paper. However, the value of 70.000 pupils having access
to improved facilities was considered also by the Government as the target for this indicator).

machine No. 4 at Ruzizi 1 power station was US$5 million. At the same time, overall savings by
local businesses using electricity produced by the machine is estimated at US$23.7 million
annually. The unit cost of construction of classrooms in Goma was about US$8,500, compared to
the average of US$16,000 for all Republic of Congo. Operating costs of UCoP (management,
monitoring, and evaluation) is 2.8% of the total project cost and the overall operating cost (all
delegated contract management firms) was around 10% of the total project cost. These costs are
very competitive compared to the Agetip21 costs taking into consideration the size of the country,
the risky environment and the isolation of the implementation areas (air transport was the most
used mode of transport).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

40.      The rating is based on relevance, PDO achievement, and efficiency. The project’s main
objectives were achieved with one shortcoming in Component C (access to water supply in areas
benefiting from water service, 43 percent achieved) and with a few targets being surpassed. The
project essentially achieved the two elements of its objectives: (i) to assist in the social and
economic reunification of the Eastern and Northern provinces with the rest of the country; and (ii)
to increase access to and use by the local population of infrastructure and social services. The
shortcoming in Component C is being addressed under PUAACV and is expected to be achieved
upon completion of work by December 30, 2011. The project was adequately designed and
adjusted as needed to suit an emergency environment requiring quick delivery of results in
isolated regions at a critical time. The revision of Component B, the forest subcomponent, did not
prevent the component from delivering results in this area, such as the revisions of forest
concessions. All issues related to the completion of rehabilitation work on RN2 and RN4 and the
M&E framework were solved during restructuring. The project was restructured when close to 75
percent of the funds were already disbursed, thus it did not affect the development objectives and
design in substance, but was intended to clarify and align the results framework and introduce
other changes to improve project effectiveness and the achievement of its objectives.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

41.      Because of the emergency status of the project, no poverty, gender, or social development
impact studies were undertaken. However, the project impacted these three areas by contributing
to fighting poverty, supporting access to services and infrastructure, and supporting local
economic development (1,747 micro projects were identified and carried out by poor populations
living in isolated areas). Despite the very difficult implementation environment of the project, the
number of direct beneficiaries is around 10 million22 (each person benefiting from one or more
enhanced services). With PUSPRES investments in targeted reunified provinces, local
populations have felt, for the first time since the end of the conflict, the presence of the
Government, which is an important factor in the reunification process. Women's participation was
a major success of Component E; the position of treasurer of the micro-projects’ community-
based activities was generally assumed by a woman. Of the direct beneficiaries, it was estimated
that 51.7 percent are female. The project improved access to maternal and neonatal care through

works and employment agency. It is a non-profit entity that is financed entirely by fees for the services it provides.

the rehabilitation of health centers and hospitals. In addition, the improvement of access to clean
water has reduced significantly the hardship of obtaining water, a task most commonly performed
by women and children. In the city of Bukavu, before PUSPRES improved the water supply
system, two hours per day was the average amount of time needed for a woman to obtain 20 liters
of clean water or for a child to obtain 10 liters. That meant waking up at 5 am and walking at
least 1 km to the stand pipe. PUSPRES also made a strong contribution to the preparation of the
second PRSP by financing a survey for the establishment of poverty benchmarks. The project
also contributed to the reunification and peace process by rehabilitating the main roads, by
restoring essential administrative capacity, by rehabilitating essential services, and by financing
micro-grants in isolated areas. Component E ensured 350,000 working days in post-conflict,
extremely remote areas, where employment opportunities had been very limited. This component
benefited nearly 1.4 million inhabitants (each person could benefit from more than one project) in
the 6 project intervention areas. The review of logging concessions resulted in (i) the cancellation
of 76 concessions deemed illegal (out of the 156 which were reviewed), reducing the area under
concession from 25 million hectares to less than 13 million hectares; (ii) the introduction of
compulsory social responsibility contracts for the renewal of concessions; (iii) clearing up
potential situations of conflict; and (iv) attracting investments and facilitating job creation.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

42.     The new procurement code was financed by PUSPRES and approved in April, 2010. This
code, the implementation of which is underway, has resulted in improved transparency of the
procurement process, in the capacity of local enterprises to bid competitively on contracts, and in
reduced costs of goods and services. The absence of a procurement code was previously a major
problem in DRC; sole-sourcing had been the only method used.

43.     One important contribution of the project at the government level is the development of a
solid national expertise in the areas of social and environmental assessment and analysis. UCoP,
a technical agency, was the governmental project implementing agency and was a participant at
the launch of the project. Through PUSPRES and other WB-funded projects, and thanks to
continual training and association of its staff in the Bank’s reviews and supervision activities,
UCoP has become a multi-disciplinary agency with remarkable expertise in social and
environmental safeguards. The preparation, review, and implementation of environmental and
social impact assessments for PUSPRES activities have reinforced the role of the Ministry of
Environment's environmental impact assessment unit (Groupe des Etudes Environnementales du
Congo - GEEC). By raising the profile of environmental and social impact management in the
development process, the Project also helped ensure that the new environmental framework law
(adopted in July 2011) provided a clear mandate for a new national environment agency
responsible for the validation and follow-up of impact assessments in all future investments.

44.      It is important to underscore that the Office des Routes had not done any work during the
fifteen years of conflict. The involvement of the Office des Routes in road design and
construction during the implementation of PUSPRES has reinforced its capacity to manage
similar investments in the future.




                                                16
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

45.      The implementation of the Action Plan for the indigenous people has objectively
contributed to improving their general living conditions 23. The project, through its indigenous
action plan, contributed significantly to the development of the indigenous people communities
along and around RN4, providing water, schools, health centers, agricultural land and tools,
extension campaigns and sensitization events to improve the Pygmy-Bantu relationship and
mutual understanding. Those activities were conducted by local NGOs. Due to the activities
carried out in the health sector, more than 3,000 indigenous people have access to better quality
health care. In education, due to the rehabilitation of the schools, 126 indigenous schoolchildren
have seen their conditions of studies improved. Implementation of the Action Plan was monitored
monthly by UCoP. Important actions have been funded by the project to help the Congolese
Institute for Nature Conservation (ICCN) to better protect the Okapi Wildlife Reserve (traversed
by the RN4, rehabilitated by the Project). These include some vital equipment and activities,
including communication devices, vehicles, and sensitization campaigns.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

46.     Surveys and interviews were carried out with representatives of beneficiary institutions
and communities during a beneficiary survey in June 2010; the details are provided in Annex 5.
The beneficiary survey showed that 83% of beneficiaries think that the project met their
expectations. For all beneficiaries the project responded to an actual need within the community
and offered new opportunities to the communities; 94% of beneficiaries noted that the project
open them to at least two new opportunities.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High

47.      The risks to development outcome derive primarily from (i) ineffective maintenance of
rehabilitated infrastructures; and (ii) slow improvement in institutional and community capacity.
All infrastructures rehabilitated under the project are operational and have been transferred to
sectoral ministries or decentralized administration. The quality of works was assessed as “good?
in technical audits carried out in 2005 and 2008 (70% of these infrastructures were achieved
before 2009). However, maintenance has been decreasing24 in some cases. The current economic
situation in DRC may pose some threats to the sustainability of the physical investments,
(although sustainability was not explicitly addressed during project preparation and appraisal).
Risks to Component A were not rated; however, macro-economic stability can be assured by the
country’s prudent fiscal policy and the existing three-year program with the International
Monetary Fund. It is likely that investments under Component C will be sustainable as regular
maintenance of roads will be assured under PRO-ROUTES (Bank financed project) but having
the resources and ensuring the maintenance will have to be monitored over time. The existence of
a Road Fund is not a guarantee that maintenance works will be carried out on a regular basis. In
addition, delays in implementing the Bank-funded program may impact sustainability. The
beneficiary survey has shown that the majority of infrastructures of Components D and E

   In regard to indigenous peoples, an Action Plan prepared by the PUSPRES implementing agency UCOP with support
from the World Bank was structured around five main components: (i) citizenship; (ii) income enhancement; (iii)

difficulties in sustaining activities have been observed.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a)Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

48.      The Bank quickly delivered a strong and multifaceted response to the urgent
rehabilitation and reconstruction needs which greatly contributed to achieving economic and
social reunification in DRC. The project was prepared in six months as an emergency operation.
The rationale for Bank involvement was well-developed and the needs were well-identified. The
PUSPRES components responded to the major identified needs. The institutional strengthening
component complemented the infrastructure rehabilitation, and both were adapted to the DRC
post-conflict situation, which was marked by weaknesses in public institutions and in governance.
However, in hindsight, the project design had some weaknesses regarding (i) its complexity and
scope (ii) the lack of an operational M&E framework; (iii) the underestimation of rehabilitation
costs of infrastructures, due to unreliable data and the absence of technical studies; (iv) the
unrealistic expectations for the time needed to set up the implementation project system under
delegated contract management. All these issues were not sufficiently anticipated at the time of
project design. This made it necessary to restructure the project and postpone the closing date.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

49.      Overall, the Bank provided good continuity both in team composition throughout the
implementation period and in regular interactions with the client, carrying out 25 supervision
missions during the entire project implementation, with an average of one mission every four
months. The Borrower noted that the change of Task Team Leader (TTL) in 2006 and other
changes in the management team did not always ensure institutional memory. However, the new
TTL based in the region close to the project provided continuous support to the client and helped
move the project forward in the very difficult post-conflict environment. The Bank demonstrated
flexibility in its willingness to work proactively with the Government to find solutions and
responses to the requests made for project restructuring, extensions, and reallocations during
implementation. The Bank was also able to solve problems linked with environmental and social
safeguards, and to set up technical audits to solve the road costs estimates. Throughout the
implementation period, the ISRs rated as “satisfactory? the progress made towards meeting the
PDO and the IP. The ISRs continuously revealed the achievements and progress of activities on
the ground. The Bank team also supported the client through the development of the agreement
procedures for collaboration with beneficiary institutions. In addition to the implementation of
PUSPRES, the Bank organized training sessions to strengthen UCoP’s capacity in disbursement
procedures; procurement; management of project results; monitoring and evaluation; and
environmental and social safeguards policies. The use of surveys to gauge the impact of the
project on beneficiaries was an excellent development supported by the Bank.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

50.     The overall MS assessment reflects MS for quality at entry and S for supervision.


                                               18
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

51.      The Government was actively involved in project preparation and quickly undertook the
necessary measures to set up the project monitoring entities: Oversight Inter-ministerial
Committee (CIS), Technical Committee of Coordination of Experts 25 (CTCE), and Project
Coordination Unit (UCoP). It also agreed to provide UCoP with autonomy in the financial
management and administrative capacities necessary for the proper execution of the project, a
significant departure from normal practices in the country. The Government took all necessary
measures to ensure that funds allocated to the project were delivered quickly. CIS meetings, even
if they were not regular, were very useful in steering the project. On the negative side, the project
suffered from high turnover of ministerial-designated focal points which occurred as a result of
Government reshufflings. In addition, many ministries did not have sufficient capacity to make
well-developed requests; the expected CTCE support to overcome these shortcomings had not
lived up to expectations. Two other difficulties were also noted: (i) the delay of the Public
Procurement Code adoption and promulgation; and (ii) issues with the indirect tax exemptions for
supplies and contracts, which would allow temporary importation of supplies linked to external
funding contracts.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

       Agency
Unité de         Satisfactory. Despite the difficult implementation environment, UCoP
Coordination des completed project activities. UCoP was able to contain at 2.8% its operating
projets (UCoP)   costs. Thanks to UCoP’s performance, the Bank awarded to UCoP the
                 coordination of three major projects (for US$382 million) and another one from
                 ADB. One of the key achievements is the quality of roads rehabilitation under
                 Component C as attested to by a technical audit, which also ensured that all
                 infrastructure developments carried out under the project had been transferred
                 to either sectoral ministries or decentralized administration. However, UCoP
                 was somewhat slow in the preparation of environmental and social documents
                 for the project; these documents were not ready within the first six months of
                 implementation, a deadline that had been established in the Legal Agreement.
                 Also, the lack of quick decision-making by UCoP about contract firms
                 sometimes led to conflict situations with firms (for example, the RN2 problem
                 with recovery of the advance payment of US$3,202,838 made on the contract
                 for the rehabilitation of the road Mbuji-Mayi–Kasongo contract). Despite some
                 of these issues, UCoP performed satisfactorily.
Bureau Central   Moderately satisfactory. BCECO, acting as a procurement agent for all
de Coordination contracts to be awarded directly by the Government under PUSPRES helped to
(BCECO)          achieve project objectives. The designation of a focal point within BCECO to
                 monitor PUSPRES activities greatly facilitated the management of project
                 activities. The work carried out under the emergency program of urban
                 rehabilitation was broadly satisfactory. However, it must be noted that the

                       design and work on the Volcan Goma stadium and the Virunga market was of
                       poor quality. The long delays recorded for procurement affected somewhat
                       negatively the performance of BCECO.
Urban                  Unsatisfactory. The execution of the MODRU assignment was slow. It took
Rehabilitation         almost a year (40% of the contractual period) for a contract to be awarded, and
Management             this contract was for only 3.5% of the total amount of the program. Following
Firm (MODRU)           this poor performance, the contract was not renewed.
United Nations         Satisfactory. UNOPS took over the MODRU contract for the implementation of
Office for             Component D. UNOPS did credible work in supporting the community
Project Services       organizations and institutions in the selection of activities.
(UNOPS)
Community              Satisfactory: MODAC was able to implement Component E despite the
Empowerment            isolation of target sites. The results are above expectations. MODAC provided a
Management             completion report detailing the performance of the outcomes with specific
Firm (MODAC)           indicators for measuring impacts.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The rating reflects the MS rating for Government performance and the S rating for the
implementing agencies 26.

6. Lessons Learned

52.      The main lessons learned are as follows.

      (i) Introduction of flexibility mechanisms at the design level in emergency projects is
          essential to allow responses to adapt to rapidly changing needs. Emergency projects are
          prepared in a short time in order to quickly produce significant impacts on the ground,
          and the valuable database necessary to make a good evaluation is usually not available.
          The case of PUSPRES is a perfect example. Thus, it is necessary from design to
          introduce flexibility mechanisms to adapt to changing needs and fill the gaps resulting
          from shortened preparation times. This flexibility should also be reflected in the
          provision of adequate resources to deal with the inevitable cost overruns.

      (ii) Delegated contract management is an effective tool to deliver services and infrastructure
           in the context of post-conflict countries. Delegated contract management is the tool to be
           favored in the implementation of activities in the context of post-conflict countries
           (multi-sector interventions, remote and widely separated sites, weak government
           capacity, etc.) with a reasonably good quality. Competitive selection based on clear
           criteria and close supervision are critical to ensure satisfactory performance of these



26
  The table in section 5.2 (b) shows that 3 out of the 5 implementing agencies functioned satisfactorily; with one
functioned moderately; and only one functioned unsatisfactorily. In a low capacity / post- conflict environment, an
overall "satisfactory" rating is justified.




                                                         20
        agencies. Most of PUSPRES components were entrusted to implementing agencies
        through delegated contract management. This in turn ensured the achievement of a large
        number of activities, and the provision of services, even in remote areas of the country,
        capable of improving the living conditions of the population.

    (iii) In post-conflict countries, the capacity of governments is often weak largely due to long
          periods of inactivity. Restarting activities through donor funding represents a difficult
          time of readjustments that can negatively impact the implementation of projects.
          Therefore, it is important upon the reinitiating of activities to have strong World Bank
          teams led by seasoned staff well aware of Bank procedures to manage these operations if
          they have to be successful. Attention should be paid to safeguards management which if
          not properly addressed may plague project implementation considering the risk of these
          operations being subject to Inspection Panel’s investigations. Capacity building should be
          taken into account from the time of design of the project through institutional
          arrangements that involve beneficiaries in all stages of the project. By means of
          partnership agreements with implementing agencies (national institutions, private sector,
          and NGOs), that have extensive experience in project management in order to enable a
          real transfer of skills and greater ownership of project results, ensuring their
          sustainability. PUSPRES had a successful experience in this situation. Finally it is
          important, as part of an emergency project, to pave the way for the transition from the
          emergency projects to sector projects.

    (iv) Proactive restructuring of post-conflicts projects is a good alternative to mitigate the
         weaknesses in the M&E framework and of project design considering the fact that
         emergency operations will always suffer from design weaknesses. The M&E framework
         is often overlooked in emergency projects which are more focused on physical
         reconstruction efforts than on monitoring impacts. PUSPRES used the restructuring
         component to set up a stronger M&E framework.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Introduction
Purpose of the study
PUSPRES results indicate that results indicators have all been achieved and some have been
overachieved.

This study informs that beneficiaries are satisfied with results achieved on the one hand, and on
the other whether these results are durable or short-lived or fragile.

Specifically, the study aims at:
   1) Searching and analyzing the degree of satisfaction by beneficiaries
   2) Identifying the mechanism and organization set up for the durability of project results and
        their efficiency; diagnosing limiting variables and making conclusions on the durability
        of results.

Observation
Beneficiary satisfaction and the durability of results were assessed only with regard to scheduled
work according to UCOP cost constraints, deadlines, and operational field. Therefore, no
considerations beyond PUSPRES action plan had to be taken into account.

Observation unit
Statistical units for which data was collected or derived are user-beneficiaries, service providers
and institutional beneficiaries of PUSPRES components 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Data collection methods and Observation units
Data were collected by types of activity and actors. The techniques of data collection used are the
following:

    -   Interview with questionnaire: from service providers (Schools, Hospitals, Office des
        Routes, FONER, RESIDESO, …)
    -   Discussions with users: housewives of neighbourhoods recently served with drinking
        water, production companies (BRALIMA, SOTEXKI) and other users.
    -   Focus group: For component 5 beneficiaries.
    -   Documents: Project reports and other documents.

1. Beneficiary satisfaction

Considering targeted issues and its operational field, PUSPRES gave answers to beneficiaries
whose total degree of satisfaction varies from “Satisfied? to “Very satisfied?

PUSPRES beneficiary satisfaction is based on, by order of importance:

a) Project responses to felt and actual needs.
All beneficiaries (100%) say that the project has responded to an actual need within the
community.

b) New opportunities given by the project
All beneficiaries say that the project has offered them new opportunities. Their satisfaction is
based on direct and indirect benefits received from the project. When beneficiaries were asked to



                                                29
name some thing they could not do before and that they could do now thanks to the project, 94%
of beneficiaries were able to give at least 2 new opportunities.

c) Meeting beneficiary expectations
The majority of beneficiaries (83%) think that the project has met their expectations as felt at the
beginning. 6% say that those expectations have been over-met, and 11% think that the
expectations have almost been met. The balance between hope at the beginning and results
obtained has been confirmed. Note: the 11% of beneficiaries who say that expectations have
almost been met were more interested in sub-projects of which conditions of objective
implementation were difficult to control. These cases were found mostly with component 4.

1.1. Component 2

1.1.1. Response to actual needs
According to beneficiaries, this component responded to the following needs as expressed in
funding agreements:
    - Improvement in working conditions (Rehabilitation of BCC building in Kisangani and
        Bukavu and of DPI Kisangani and Bukavu)
    - Modernization of working tools (98 computers, 26 four by four trucks, 33 generators, 11
        VSAT, 44 motorcycles, 95 bicycles …)
    - Training of DGI, DGRAD and OFIDA staff
    - Implementation of participative consultation for DSRP development
    - Development of procurement contract code

1.1.2 Results and meeting beneficiary expectations
The project allowed the Government to get data collected from participative consultation for
DSRP development, conversion of 65 forest licenses, and the promulgation of procurement
contract code.

Tax revenues of provinces have increased by 368% from 2004 to 2008. The project has
participated in the extension of the central government power signatory of the agreements on
behalf of the Republic to the advantage of reunited territories.

Provincial departments of reunited provinces have restarted and confirmed their collaboration
with the headquarters in Kinshasa by harmonizing procedures and working tools between services
of reunited provinces and the entire country. As a matter of fact, the Central Government that
signed the funding agreements on behalf of provinces and contributed to their implementation has
taken control of the modernization and management of branches and thereby reinforcing
economic and social reunification.

Training seminars, reform dissemination, decentralization seminars and the many supervision
missions have allowed the mixing of national managers professionally without taking into
account geopolitical differences of the conflict period.

1.2. Component 3

The high degree of satisfaction by beneficiaries with this component together with the high rate
of beneficiaries has largely influenced the level of total satisfaction by PUSPRES beneficiaries.




                                                30
Beneficiaries of RN2 and RN4 rehabilitation include institutional managers (Office des Routes),
professional corporation (ACCO), production companies and other users (local population…).
The component offered 925 km for a beneficiary population estimated at 9 millions.

1.2.1. Response to actual needs
Beneficiaries agree with the project response to an actual need expressed and expected for over a
decade.

For example:
BRALIMA Kisangani lost its selling points in Bunia, Beni and Butembo following the closing of
RN4.
SOTEXKI (Kisangani Textile Company) faced serious procurement problems of raw materials.
Because the road was impassable, SOTEXKI had to airship cotton produced in Congo (Ituri and
Uélé) to Kisangani from Uganda.

1.2.2. Results and new opportunities
With the reopening of RN4
The impacts of RN4 go beyond the rehabilitated length by connecting itself to Bunia through
Komanda and to Butembo through Beni.

Road users and residents:
The average driving time on the rehabilitated stretch of road has increased by 97% 28. Residents’
access to basic social services has considerably improved.

Kisangani BRALIMA tripled its production of 10,000 hectolitres to 30,000 hectolitres, thereby
reaching its maximum production capacity. It opened selling points in Bunia, Beni, and Butembo.
With a RN4 rehabilitated, it was able to reach 52% of its consumers. It was able to get back its
shares of the market and moved back imports of Ugandan beer. In the meantime, the number of
employees increased by 166%, that is from 150 staff members to 400 staff members.

Kisangani SOTEXKI has considerably reduced the cost of its procurement of raw materials. It
gets its supplies from Mahagi where it now takes care of 5,000 farmers (that is, as many
households). It has opened selling points in Mahagi and Bunia and it now receives orders from
Goma and Bukavu that it can now supply using RN4 rehabilitated. From 214 employees in 2009
(the year RN4 was rehabilitated), SOTEXKI has 450 employees today. It can do better because
as of now it only produces 10% of its capacity due to poor demand. SOTEXKI management says
that, if RN2 was not rehabilitated, the plant could close.

With the re-opening of RN2
Increase of monthly traffic. From 0 before rehabilitation, current monthly traffic is of 1,660
vehicles a month 29, including: 179 cars, 900 buses, 376 trucks of less than 10 tons, 155 trucks of
more than 10 tons, 50 heavy weight trucks. Over 210 passengers use this road a day, 80 departing
from Bukavu and 130 arriving in Bukavu 30.

Bukavu BRALIMA
Before rehabilitation, RN2 residents’ orders varied around 1,000 hectolitres a month that were
airlifted or taken on man back. Today, orders are of 9,718 hectolitres, that is an increase of
972% and represents 15% of the market share. Kamituga consumption (final point of
rehabilitated RN2 at PK 175) represents one third of the consumption going through RN2 (3,500
hectolitres a month). The production capacity of Bukavu BRALIMA (65,000 hectolitres) no
longer meets its demand, thus the need to double the production capacity in the next two years by
investing 20 million Euros.

1.3. Component 4

This component intervened mainly in the rehabilitation of the production and distribution of
drinking water (over 187,000 beneficiaries), of the production and distribution of electric power,
of schools (over 70,000 beneficiaries), of hospitals and health centers (over 1.5 million
beneficiaries).

1.3.1. Response to expressed and actual needs (before the project)
The project undertook actions that led to the operation of infrastructures, the quality of services
and an increase in the number of users. Beneficiaries agree that the project responded to the
following actual needs:

Drinking water. Before, the quality of service was very poor: Most customers were not served
and losses in production due to leaks were beyond 20%. Shortage was so high that it was no
longer possible to serve new neighbourhoods.

Illustration. In Bukavu, new connections to the network funded by PUSPRES have just started. In
the Mulambula neighbourhood (30 connections as of today), women used to get up by 5 o’clock
in the morning to queue in front of a drinking fountain located at 1 km away. Considering the
distance, the hill to be climbed, the low flow and the size of the population, the average time
needed to collect a quantity of 10 liters (for children) or 20 liters (for adults) was 2 hours.
Children’s schedules were further congested with daily water collection chores to the extent that
they had to go school late and did not have time to study.

Electricity. The Ruzizi dam used to generate 12 Mega Watts over an installed power of 26 Mega
Watts, or 46% of its capacity. In Kindu, the underground network was obsolete and subject to
multiple breakdowns, which caused accidents.

Hospitals. Accommodation conditions for patients were very poor, basic equipments were lacking,
the staff was unmotivated and the frequency of users got low.

Schools. Registration rate was low, operating costs were largely insufficient, and the rate of class
days lost due to bad weather was high.

1.3.2. Results and meeting beneficiaries’ expectations
Target populations benefit from a 60% increase of drinking water service. In the 43 rehabilitated
schools, attendance rate increased by 409%, and the number of class days lost due to bad weather
went from 66 to 0 days. In the 18 hospitals and health centers rehabilitated, access to health
equipments increased by 111%.

For energy. Improvement in the quality of service as a result of the increase of the production
capacity of the Ruzizi 1 dam in Bukavu, from 46% to 72% (20 MW) of its installed capacity. In


                                                32
Kindu, the rehabilitation of 2 BT power stations and the upgrading of the network in the Kasuku
commune helped to connect 81% of subscribers in the city and an increase of 17% additional
subscribers (353) on the targeted site.

1.4.1 Response to actual needs

Agriculture: End of the rotating system of one tool for many households with subsequent
conflicts.

Water: Improvement of the quality, quantity, and nearness of drinking water.

Education: Increase in attendance and improvement of schooling quality.

Health: Geographic access to care, reduction of childbirth unassisted by a medical staff

1.4.2. Benefits and meeting beneficiaries’ expectations
The project contributed to the improvement of living conditions of component 5 beneficiaries, the
promotion of local economies, the creation of new markets, the slowing of rural exodus, and other
related benefits as a results of injecting funds in rural economies. This is what explains that the
majority of beneficiaries say they are satisfied.

2. Durability of results

The first cases of rehabilitated infrastructures date 2006. In 2009, over 70 % were completed.

Thus we have enough data to assess:

    1) organized and supported involvement of beneficiaries to make good use of the process
       and ensure durability of results
    2) the capacity to maintain the level of results of project activities in compliance with
       economic, social, and environmental balances.

2.1. Status of infrastructures

All infrastructures rehabilitated under this project are operational. However, le level of service of
rehabilitated roads has decreased.

2.2. Actions undertaken under the project

Some conditions were set up in order to maintain the level of results obtained at the reception of
infrastructures in compliance with economic, social and environmental balances.
They include:
    • Involvement of institutional beneficiaries (services providers) and users (component 5)
         throughout the project cycle, and thus, ownership of project achievements (case of
         component 2,3,4, 5)
    • Beneficiaries’ capacity building (case of component 2 and 3)
    • Taking care of maintenance while organising caretaking capacity, setting up FONER
         (case of capacity 3)
    • Existence of relay organizations (local committees for component 5) and durable
         structures in charge of maintenance including the Department of Road maintenance, the
         Department of school buildings …
    • Diagnostic and prevention on the status and maintenance of infrastructures (bridge on RN
         4 and Ruzizi 1 dam)




                                                 34
2.3. Actions by beneficiaries

Beneficiaries’ involvement and maintenance capacity can be seen through concrete actions on site.

Synchronizing the reception of rehabilitated roads and the beginning of FONER activities was not
successful, but on site, some actions can now be seen, which gives hope. Office des Routes
achievements as funded by FONER are increasing on rehabilitated roads. They go from manual
and mechanical road mending to bridge mending. We can notice a restart of services although it
does not yet reach the level of the reception period.

The rehabilitation of basic social services allowed the increase in their attendance, and thereby
the possibility of self-sufficiency by billing services.

This is the case of schools that take care of the repair of school furniture, payment of teachers’
bonuses, and other achievements such as the fence of Kabondo institute by their own funds…

It is also the case of hospitals such as Muhanzi that has built a new access way with an entry gate
and Brazza Health Center (maternity) that built two new wards with their own funds…

However, self-funding covers only about 50% of operating needs of hospitals and health centers
due to poor rate of bill collection that is of 65% in average.

The empowerment of rural communities in the choice and implementation of projects has created
habits of meetings, of diagnosing weaknesses, and the keeping of assets through dialog.

Component 5 allowed the structuring of communities, intra-community collaboration,
reinforcement of group awareness, and ownership of project products as community goods.

However, a certain number of limiting factors does not allow to secure funding of optimal
maintenance.

2.4. Additional actions

Additional support from other development partners has also been observed in all rehabilitated
hospitals and health centers under PUSPRES. The observed effect of tender reinforced the
project impact. For rehabilitated schools, PURUS (IDA) provides highly valued support to the
functioning of rehabilitated schools.

2.5. Conclusion

It can be confirmed that results obtained by PUSPRES are durable and give satisfaction to their
direct (over four millions) and indirect beneficiaries.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Project Background

1.    The purpose of the Emergency Economic and Social Reunification Support Project
(PUPRES) was to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo to meet the challenge of it social and
economic reunification after a decade of instability and political conflicts.

2.       It was appraised in January 2003, soon after the signature of Pretoria Agreement had
initiated the process of political reunification. Because of the poor accessibility to the provinces
to be reunified and of the lack of safety in the project areas, the Project appraisal and preparation
of the Project were scanty, mainly regarding the road sector. For the same reasons, social and
environmental studies which could not be carried out at appraisal.

3.       The situation has continued during Project implementation and hampered its progress.
The transportation systems have improved progressively but it was only in January 2009 that the
safety situation improved noticeably and durably.

4.      The Project implementation was managed by Unité de Coordination des Projets (UCOP)
but, because the project operations were diverse and widespread at numerous sites, it was
necessary to hire also BCECO to process procurement and other entities to implement urban and
community operations at the sites as local employers and executing agencies.

5.      The Project was also subject to delays at its start because of delays the in the finalization
of the complex institutional arrangements, difficulties in the work site supply system and of the
weakness and lack of experience of the stake holders in this type of project.

Project Objectives and Formulation

6.      The Project Development Objectives (PDO) intended to help the Government in its
efforts towards economic recovery and social reconciliation, and therefore stabilize the
administration of the whole nation, fit with priority orientations defined in December 2002.

7.       PDO are coherent with those of the 2003 government transitional economic program de
2003 and the project activities were sufficiently diversified to meet its priorities which were: (i) to
rehabilitate the key institutions; (ii) rehabilitate a wide range of infrastructure, equipment and
services so as to boost local economy; and (iii) to prepare future operations which could be
financed by the international community.

8.      Extensive consultation of the beneficiaries has largely contributed to the credibility of the
specific objectives of nation reunification, improvement of access to public services and rural
economy revival.

9.      The relevance of the Project priorities in regards to the improvement of life conditions for
the population living in poverty was largely verified when the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) was issued.




                                                  37
Project Implementation

10.     Although the Project complexity required some adjustments at the beginning which
delayed and slowed down its implementation, it was judicious since it allowed the drafting of the
most qualified individuals to implement each component and allocate the risks and human
resources among them.

11.     However, the implementation planning did not take into account enough time necessary
for dialogue, participatory preparation of the programs and the elaboration of the partnership
agreements between the numerous stakeholders.

12.      Starting of the Project was slow and painful due to the lack of experience by the different
stakeholders in the institutional arrangements set up by the Project and in World Bank procedures,
difficulties in the mobilization of international consultants, insecurity and weakness in the banks
and other financial institutions and failure of the transport system.

13.     In spite of these delays, the mid-term review of June 2006 concluded that the Project
implementation was « globally satisfactory in spite of extremely difficult context and conditions
of deployment of activities in the East part of the Country ». This review led to a reshaping of
Project activities, to take into account the planning changes and the cost overrun resulting from
these delays.

14.      Then, Project implementation did not meet any major problems in spite of some
difficulties, among them:
    •   The default of Transwansea Enterprise and the major cost overrun of the rehabilitation
        works on Bukavu - Kasongo section (Lot 4000) which led to the reduction of the length
        of RN2 to be rehabilitated from 1,020 km to around 220 km;
    •   The major delays accumulated by the executing agency (Urban Rehabilitation
        Management Firm: Maître d’Ouvrage Délégué à la Réhabilitation Urbaine - MODRU -
        Transtec-Ellyps-Smits) due to its incapability of implementing the major operations in the
        area of electricity and water supply lending to the termination of its contract; and
    •   The interruption for several months of the Component « Aide aux communautés isolées »
        due to discrepancies between the World Bank and the Project Unit in Financial
        management of the micro-gifts included in this Component.


15.      In spite of these difficulties, one year before the new closing date of the Project, 92% of
the funds were disbursed. All components were achieved except Component 4. Then, the
financial crisis of September 2009 resulted in a shortfall of around 13 million US$. To address
this issue, a new amendment was concluded in September 2010 to delay the end of the Project for
6 months (from September 30, 2010 to March 31, 2011). The Bank agreed to finance the balance
of the expenditures which could not be taken into account by PUSPRES through PUAACV.

Evaluation of Project Performances

16.     Overall, the Project met its objectives except for the road component as shown in the
attached tables « Evolution of Results Indicators » and « Overall Synthesis of the Project ».




                                                38
Concerning the Road Rehabilitation, paved section of 8.4 km of RN1 has been rehabilitated as
planned; about 970 km of unpaved roads out of the 1,770 km initially planned have been
rehabilitated (751 km on RN4 and 217 km on RN2). This reduction results from the
underestimation of the size of the rehabilitation works and from the increase of the cost per km
compared to the appraisal cost.

17.      Out of US$32.5 million allocated to the Urban Rehabilitation Component, US$33.02
million was committed and US$34.67 million was actually spent. As planned during Project
Appraisal, this Component included rehabilitation works in 4 large towns (Goma, Bukavu,
Kisangani and Kindu) and 8 middle size towns (Bumba, Isiro, Kalémie, Uvira, Kalima, Kasongo,
Lusambo, Butembo). The operations included rehabilitation of 27 schools (104 school rooms), 27
health facilities, water supply facilities in 3 large towns, electric production facility of Ruzizi, 6
road bridges and 2.6 km of urban roads in Bukavu. These operations allow on one hand
establishment or improvement of public services and, on the other hand, restoration of the
credibility of the institutions in charge of the management of these infrastructures and open the
door to other donor interventions.

18.      The Communities Reinforcement Component was implemented in the 6 districts
identified at appraisal (Buta, Gemena, Isiro, Kibombo, Lodja and Masisi). Out of the US$12.9
million allocated to this component, only US$9.7 million was disbursed because of the delays in
the implementation and the reduction of the available funds at the end of the Project. This
Component allows implementation of 1,747 micro-projects (compared to 500 planned at
appraisal) in 1,467 communities, for a total of 1.38 million inhabitants. 61% of the micro-projects
were related to agriculture production and 49% to services.

19.      Indisputably, the Project contributed to the reunification process mainly because of its
visibility, of the major implication of the beneficiaries in the programming of the activities and of
the relevance of the choice of rehabilitated infrastructures. The reopening of priority roads has
contributed to the reunification of former rebellion areas with the rest of the country and to reduce
insecurity, namely in allowing the security forces to access to previously landlocked areas.

20.    The Project was also effective through its impact on the unification of antagonistic
communities and its impact on the settling of the indigenous population such as the Pygmy. It
improved access to urban services and increased by 25 to 400% school attendance and, by 60 to
90% hospital visits and by 10 to 30% the access to drinkable water.

21.     The Project also had a significant impact on the economy by reinforcing the
Government’s capacity to finance the short term importation expenditures though the first
Component, by increasing the capacity of the institutions in charge of resource collection, by
reducing the cost of transport and by increasing dramatically agriculture production in the area
influenced by the Project.

22.     The Project had an impact on a large number of people: 1.5 million inhabitants benefited
from road reopening, 8.8 million people benefited directly or indirectly from the rehabilitation of
RN2 and RN4, 1.4 members of the beneficiary communities benefited from the micro-projects,
187,000 additional people had access to drinking water in 3 major cities, 1 million people
benefited from rehabilitated health facilities and 70,000 school attendees from rehabilitated
school facilities.




                                                 39
Performance of the Government and Project Unit (UCOP)

23.      The Project benefited from a sustained support from the Government, which played
efficiently its role in coordinating the Project, in supporting its implementation through the
central and local public entities and in interfacing with the World Bank.

24.     UCOP managed the Project efficiently. It was able to mobilize the competent staff and
outside human resources necessary to face numerous Project issues and proceed with several
Project adjustments.

25.     The Project implementation was rated « generally satisfactory » by the World Bank and,
following this appreciation, UCOP was charged with the implementation of 4 additional projects
for an amount totaling more than twice the amount of PUSPRES.

World Bank Performance

26.     The World Bank gave an efficient support to the implementation of the Project. The
preparation of Project was fast despite difficulties and a lack of reliable data. 25 supervision
missions were carried out (one every 4 months) during which the Bank brought an efficient
support to the Government in the area of procurement, in solving the problems encountered in the
execution of contracts and in implementing environmental mitigation actions. Amendments and
adjustments to the financing agreements were timely prepared to face the financing gaps and
correct underestimation, which affected the Project appraisal.

Social and Environmental Impacts of the Project

The Project was classified B.

27.     Given the emergency situation it has not been possible to proceed to an environmental
assessment at appraisal. The financing agreements required that this assessment be prepared
within the first 12 months of the Project implementation period. (December 2004).

28.     At the start, the Project used temporarily the outputs of the environmental studies carried
out as part of the preparation of the Government emergency rehabilitation program (PMURR).

29.     The Project Environmental Management Plan was finalized in January 2006 and was
soon implemented within the limit of the available resources. The one year delay beyond the
Project deadline was caused by the slow recruitment of the consultant firm in charge of the
preparation of Plan (14 months).

30.     A major environmental issue has impacted the execution of the rehabilitation works of
RN4: following a complaint by a NGO involved in Pygmy protection, the works in the section
crossing the Okapi Wildlife Reserve were interrupted for more than 6 months.

Project Sustainability

31.     The participation process used for programming the activities as well as extensive dialog
with the varied institutions and the beneficiary communities guaranteed the highest standards for
sustainable maintenance of the infrastructure and for the replacement of the equipment.




                                                40
32.     The programming and implementation set up for the Project seems to be sustainable since
NGOs involved internalized the procedures of identification and implementation of micro-
projects.

33.      However, due to the lack of sufficient follow-up and support, some schools are still not
able to fully finance their maintenance expenditures and the community dynamic that was set up
tends to fade away.

34.     Regarding the road component, the level of service obtained through the Project tends to
decrease because Office des routes did not continue maintenance on the rehabilitated road
sections, which were initiated by UCOP.

Lessons Learned and Recommendations

35.       The main lessons learned from the Project are the followings:

       Close consultation with beneficiaries leads to real ownership of the Project;

       The delegation of the procurement and monitoring activities facilitate the Project
        implementation when operations are many and widespread;

       Dynamism of the management team and recruitment of staff experienced and
        knowledgeable in local environment are key factors in success;

       Because the specific data of each project site was not take into account, the costs of the
        road component were underestimated;

       Local enterprises were not competitive enough to meet the criteria of the bidding
        documents for the road Works except for the building rehabilitation works;

       The Project contributed to increased dynamism within the banking sector;

       The public infrastructures rehabilitated under the Project did not benefited from sufficient
        post rehabilitation support to guarantee the sustainability of the impacts; and

       The lack of control of the importation procedures by the local banks resulted in delays in
        the implementation of the Component 1.

36.       Recommendations resulting from the Project experience are the followings:

       Cost Estimate of Works and Planning
        Project costs and planning for emergency project such as PUSPRES should include funds
        to cover potential overruns in estimates and time;

       Clarification of expectations and technical strategy regarding the rehabilitated
        infrastructures
        At appraisal, the objectives of the rehabilitation works and the technical standards should
        be established clearly in order to offer the level of services required, taking into account
        regular and periodic maintenance to be carried out by the institutions in charge after
        rehabilitation. The projects should finance these maintenance activities until the
        institutions are able to include them in their budget;


                                                 41
       Solving Problems as they appear
        The stakeholders should concentrate and collaborate on the quick resolution of the
        problems as soon as they appear. Regarding the sustainability of the projects, although
        dialogue and negotiation are time-consuming, there are essential.

       Local Enterprise Competitiveness
        The stakeholders should consider including a training and support program for the local
        enterprises (for example through equipment financing) to help them meet the bidding
        documents requirements.
