BRAZIL -. ALCOHOL AND BIOMASS ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01       The Government of Brazil has requested Bank financing for its
1981-85 Nati.onal Alcohol Program (PROALCOOL), consisting of (i) approximately
350 alcohol producing facilities of an average capacity of 120,000 liters/day
each, and (ii) a technology development program to improve biomass energy raw
materials and processing technologies. The capital investment requirements
of the 1981-85 program, including physical and price contingencies, working
capital and interest during construction, are estimated at US$7.4 billion
equivalent in current terms, of which US$2.3 billion would be in foreign
exchange.
1.02       The Alcohol Program is a unique effort by Brazil to take advantage
of its vast agricultural resources, ready availability of local technology and
rural labor to create usable premium energy (alcohol.) to substitute for
imported energy. The Program is an integral part of Brazil's comprehensive
strategy to reduce the mounting cost of imported petroleum which in 1980
reached US$10.2 billion, the equivalent of 50% of the country's export
earnings. Brazil's goal is to produce 10.7 billion liters of alcohol from
sugarcane and cassava by 1985 to substitute for 45% of the projected gaso-
line consumption, equivalent to about 148,000 barrels of petroleum per day
or 5% of the forecast 1985 national energy requirements. Brazilian automobile
users have already accepted alcohol as a satisfactory fuel. Since the Alcohol
Program's inception in late 1975, Brazil's alcohol production has increased
sevenfold and the average alcohol-gasoline blend has increased from 1% in 1975
to about 19% in 1980; future emphasis will be on pure alcohol as automotive
fuel with the objective of meeting all of Brazil's future incremental gasoline
demand by alcohol. The overall scope and direction of the Program through 1985
is well conceived and reasonable, and the production of alcohol from sugarcane
(and molasses) is economically attractive. Retail alcohol sales in Brazil now
generate substantial net revenues to the Government, wi.th future investments
to increase capacity being financed mainly by contributions from alcohol
conisumers and investors. PROALCOOL is also generating jobs in the economy,
increasing capacity utilization of the domestic equipment manufacturing
industry and will put Brazil in the forefront of renewable energy technology
providing a basis for a new export industry in that country.
1.03      The proposed Bank project (the Project) was identified in November
1979 by a mission consisting of Messrs. Harinder S. Kohli, Don Brown, Pierre
Larroque and James Goering, Bank staff, and Messrs. Norman Rask and William
Beatty, consultants, which reviewed the Alcohol and Biomass Energy sector as
part of a comprehensive Bank review of the Brazilian energy sector. The
Project will take a sector approach to support the 1981-83 time slice of the
Alcohol Program and consists of (i) an Alcohol Production Component of approx-
imately 250 units each of about 120,000 liters/day capacity equivalent to
increase Brazil's alcohol production from 3.4 billion liters in 1980 to
10.7 billion liters by 1985; (ii) a Technology Development Component to
improve raw material yields and processing technologies; and (iii) creation of
a Monitoring and Evaluation System to provide Brazil with an effective tool
for planning the future development of the Alcohol 'Program taking into account
its impact on the energy, industry and agriculture sectors.
1.04      The financing requirements of the Project, including physical and
price contingencies, interest during construction and working capital, are
estimated at US$5.1 billion equivalent in current terms, of which US$1.6 billion



-2-
is in foreign exchange. The proposed Bank loan of US$250.0 million would cover
about 6% of the long term financing requirements or about 16% of the foreign
exchange need. The Government has indicated its intention to seek foreign private
co-financing of at least US$250.0 million equivalent to meet part of the foreign
exchange requirements; the balance of US$1,099.0 million foreign exchange requirement
will be provided from Government resources. The local currency requirements of
US$3.5 billion equivalent would be provided by (i) alcohol sub-project sponsors'
equity (US$764.0 million); (ii) consumer contributions generated by alcohol sales
and taxes on automobile owners/users (US$1,810.0)and (iii) short-term borrowings
from local banks (US$942.0 million). The Government is the borrower of the
proposed Bank loan and will bear the foreign exchange risk.
1.05      The physical implementation of the alcohol producing facilities, i.e.,
the Alcohol Production Component, will be undertaken by the private sector, who
will own them. Each sub-project would be appraised in accordance with appraisal
criteria agreed between the Government, Banco Central do Brasil, Brazil's Central
Bank, and the Executive Secretariat of the National Alcohol Commission (CENAL),
the government agency responsible for the implementation of PROALCOOL and the
Bank. The Technology Development Component will be coordinated by Financiadora de
Estudos e Projetos (FINEP), a financial institution specializing in financing of
the basic and applied research activities of Brazilian enterprises, and
Secretaria de Technologia Industrial (STI), a unit under the Ministry of Industry
and Commerce (MIC) with responsibility for promoting the development of all
industrial technology in Brazil. The actual technology development work will be
undertaken by various private and public sector organizations and institutes. The
Monitoring and Evaluation System will be developed and implemented by the Executive
Secretariat of the National Alcohol Commission (CENAL), with the assistance of
other Government agencies and independent research institutions.
II. BRAZIL'S ENERGY STRATEGY AND PETROLEUM AND ALCOHOL SECTORS
A.   Energy Situation
2.01      A detailed analysis of the Brazilian energy sector is given in the
Bank's report, "Petroleum Sector in Brazil," currently under finalization.
Brazil's energy consumption is dominated by petroleum products as shown below:

Petroleum products account for 41.5% of energy consumption, about 85% of which
is imported. In 1979, the cost of petroleum imports amounted to about US$7.0
billion, equivalent to about 45% of total export revenue. The petroleum
import bi-Ll for 1980 was US$10.2 billion, or about 50% of the export earnings.
The large and growing cost of oil imports is a major cause of the country's
severe balance of payments difficulties and a principal rationale for Brazil's
Alcohol Program.
B.   Energy Strategy
2.02      Brazil's consumption of petroleum products grew from 19 billion
liters in 1965 to 58 billion liters in 1979, at an average rate of 8.1%
(para 2.03). To restrict petroleum imports, Brazil has instituted a compre-
hensive national energy strategy to (i) promote conservation by sharply
increasing petroleum product prices; (ii) increase domestic crude oil production
from the 171,000 barrels per day (bpd) level in 1979 to 300,000 bpd in 1983;
(iii) modify the production profile of its refineries to better balance
domestic petroleum products demand and supply pattern by reducing gasoline
and increasing diesel production; (iv) increase coal production from the
present 4.5 million tons per year (tpy) of usable coal to 12 million tons per
year (tpy) by 1985; (v) increase hydroelectric capacity by 80% by 1985 from
the current capacity of 24,240 MW; (vi) increase fuelwood and charcoal production
from 23 million tons of petroleum equivalent (tpe) in 1979 to 29 million tpe
by 1985; and (vii) increase alcohol production from 2.4 billion liters in 1979
to 10.7 billion liters by 1985 (equivalent to 148,000 bpd of petroleum). The
coal, charcoal and hydroelectric power programs are aimed at substituting fuel
oil, while the Alcohol Program will substantially reduce gasoline requirements.
The refinery modifications will at the same time increase diesel availability
with the same crude oil supplies. The goal of all these complementary efforts
is to substitute as far as possible with domestic supplies all major components
of the (imported) petroleum barrel.
C.   Petroleum Demand
2.03      Demand for petroleum, taking into account the above programs, is
expected to grow to 69 billion liters in 1985, or only at a rate of 3.1% per
year compared to the 8.1% rate between 1965-79, as shown below:

-4-
The Alcohol Program is basically on target; so the forecast reduction in
gasoline consumption is considered achievable, particularly since any minor
delays in alcohol production buildup would most likely be offset by a slower
than projected alcohol demand for chemical use (para 2.13). The timely
achievement of the coal and charcoal programs is questionable; it affects
primarily fuel oil. The proportions of gasoline and fuel oil in the total
petroleum demand profile are expected to drop with a consequent increase in
the proportion of diesel oil whose demand growth is unlikely to be substantially
affected by the Alcohol Program (para 2.07).
2.04      Refinery output and demand patterns have been reasonably in balance
in recent years due to relaxation of diesel oil specifications thereby increasing
diesel production at the expense of gasoline. However, the domestic refining
profile may have to be reoriented in the coming years by installation of
additional secondary processing facilities to convert excess fuel oil into
diesel oil. Development work for diesel blending with ethanol, as well as
replacement of diesel oil by vegetable oils, are being undertaken by automobile
manufacturers and research institutions. However, such efforts are likely to
have very little impact prior to 1985. The impact of the Alcohol Program
will, therefore, be felt more in the reduction in gasoline requirements
compared to that for diesel, leading to the large shift in demand profile
shown in para 2.03. While over the medium to long-term PETROBRAS' refining
program can be adjusted to the new demand profile, it is likely that Brazil will
have to export some quantities of naphtha/gasoline in the short term. Therefore,
continued close coordination is needed between the Executive Secretariat of the
National Alcohol Commission (CENAL), the National Petroleum Council (CNP) and
PETROBRAS, regarding the impact of increased alcohol production on total
imports/exports of petroleum and on refinery operations. Also, since petroleum
imports can be reduced significantly only by substituting all major petroleum
fractions, complementary efforts to increase diesel supplies and find economic
substitutes for it should continue to receive high priority.
D.   Gasoline Demand and Ethanol Substitution
2.05      Consumption of automobile fuel, i.e., gasoline and ethanol (alcohol),
increased at 3% p.a. from 13.0 billion liters in 1973 to 16.3 billion liters
in 1980.  The demand is projected to increase at a rate of 4.6% p.a. through
1985 to 20.4 billion liters, with more than an average growth rate in the
Southeast as shown below:

2.06      The share of gasoline in the total automobile fuel will progressively
decrease with the increased use of hydrous alcohol f'or all-alcohol fuelled
automobiles. The 1985 automobile fuel requirements are, as noted in para 2.05,
estimated at 20.4 billion liters, including 11.3 billion liters of gasoline
(55%), 6.5 billion liters of hydrous alcohol (32%) and 2.7 billion liters of
anhydrous alcohol in gasohol (13%). 1/ Technical aspects concerning substi-
tution of ethanol for automotive fuel are discussed in the report "Alcohol
Production from Biomass: Potential and Prospects in the Developing Countries"
(Report No.3021, dated June 4,1980).
E.   Diesel Oil Substitution
2.07      At present, the Alcohol Program does not envisage any appreciable
substitution of diesel oil with ethanol during the '1981-85 period. Unlike in
the case of ethanol addition to gasoline, where the lower heat value of
ethanol is compensated by its higher octane number and combustion efficiency,
there are apparently no compensating characteristics in ethanol used in
compression-ignition (diesel) engines. In fact, ethanol addition worsens
the combustion in diesel engines. However, considerable development'work has
been initiated in Brazil and elsewhere towards diesel oil extension with
ethanol and replacing diesel oil by a variety of vegetable oils. Earlier
attempts in the direction of simple addition of anhydrous alcohol to diesel
oil in proportion up to 10% ethanol were not effective due to problems of
phase separation in the presence of small quantities of water and more
importantly, the reduction in the diesel quality to below acceptable limits.
Present work is oriented towards developing additivess which improve tolerance
of ethanol addition on diesel quality.
2.08      Automobile manufacturers in Brazil are currently evaluating the
use of vegetable oils as diesel engine fuel. The major oils under consider-
ation are peanut, soybean, rapeseed, cotton seed, a-nd palm oils. Although
these oils possess heating value and diesel index levels comparable to normal
diesel oil, they contain unsaturated compounds which cause polymer and coke
formation in engines. Development is directed towards improvements in fuel
injection equipment and pretreatment of the oils by hydrogenation. Vegetable
oil substitution for diesel will have no direct impact on the Alcohol Program
but will on the petroleum refinery production profile (para 2.04). The economic
cost of production of vegetable oils must also be investigated along with the
impact on agriculture if large scale diesel substitution is anticipated.
F.   Brazilian Automotive Vehicle Fleet
2.09      In 1979, gasohol-powered automotive fleet (virtually all otto-engine
vehicles in Brazil use gasohol) totalled 7.7 million vehicles. One estimate
(Ford Brasil) places the vehicle population in 1985 at about 12 million, a
growth rate of 7.7% p.a. On the basis of the projected automobile fuel con-
sumption growth rate of 4.6% p.a. through 1985 (para. 2.05), the vehicle
population is more likely to grow to about 10 million by 1985. About 2.5
million or 25% of the 1985 vehicle population is expected to be all-alcohol
vehicles. Production of all-alcohol cars in 1980 is estimated at 250,000;
1/ Anhydrous alcohol (99.8% purity) is blended with gasoline to make gasohol
up to a mixture of 20% alcohol and 80% gasoline. Hydrous alcohol (94% purity)
is used to fuel all-alcohol engines.



-6-
the production level is planned to increase to 450,000 - 500,000 by 1983 to keep
pace with the availability of hydrous alcohol.
G.   Vehicle Conversion
2.10      In addition to the production of new all-alcohol powered automobiles,
the Alcohol Program is encouraging the conversion of existing gasoline/gasohol-
powered cars to use hydrous alcohol. Such conversion consists primarily of minor
cylinder head modifications, addition of a fuel preheating system and cold-start
facilities, and calibration of carburetor as well as changes in the ignition system
and of the materials of construction of the fuel system.
2.11      The Secretaria de Tecnologia Industrial (STI), a unit under the Ministry
of Industry and Commerce (MIC), administers the program of automobile conversion
to all-ethanol fueling through its Technological Control Centers which in turn
utilize the services of 13 institutes/university research stations for deter-
mining the extent of modifications for individual automobile models, qualify
entrepreneurs for undertaking conversion work, approve convertors' prototype
incorporating the modifications and provide continued technical advice and
services to convertors. At June-end 1980, 156 convertors with conversion
capacity of 15,600 per month had been approved by STI. About 80,000 cars had
been converted for hydrous alcohol fuel use by June 30, 1980. CENAL estimates
that the conversion rate will increase to about 110,000 cars/year in 1981,
bringing the number of cars converted by 1985 to approximately 660,000.
H.   Ethanol for Chemicals
2.12      Existing capacities for chemicals based on ethanol feedstock are:

Ethyl Chloride                      60                   0.1
144.6
In addition to the above, Union Carbide's ethylene plant (23,000 tpy) which
ceased operations in 1969 is being reactivated, and the Coperbo polybutadiene
plant (30,000 tpy) is being revamped to produce 30,000 tpy ethylene by 1982.
Both of these plants are located in Sao Paulo. A new 60,000 tpy ethylene plant
by Salgema Industries in Alagoas is also expected to commence operations in
1982. These additional ethylene capacities would require about 260 million
liters of alcohol per year (lpy).  Coperbo's acetaldehyde plant of 50,000 tpy
capacity which ceased operations in 1971 is also being reactivated, which when
operated will require about 76 million lpy of alcohol feedstock. Thus, by
1982 the total demand for ethanol for currently operating plants and those
foreseen in the near future is expected to approach 500 million lpy.



-7-
2.13      No new large volume chemical manufacture based on ethanol has been
announced. Alcohol demand for chemicals beyond 0.5 billion lpy in 1985 will
depend on development of new industrial projects which would take 3-4 years to
plan and implement. No more than 1-2 new projects with total ethanol consumption
of 0.2 billion lpy would appear likely. Thus a consumption of 0.5 to 0.7 billion
liters of ethanol for chemical uses by 1985 is a more likely consumption target
than the Government estimate of 1.5 billion liters by 1985. However, any ethanol
not consumed by the chemical industry can be absorbed in the automotive fuel
market.

a/ Sugarcane and alcohol year ends April 30.
Ethanol has been used as a gasoline additive in Brazil for more than 40 years
and ranged from 1-6% through the mid-1970s, depending largely on availability.
Between 1970-75, domestic alcohol production fluctuated around 600 million lpy
representing an average distillery operating rate oE only 48% as the Institute
of Sugar and Alcohol (IAA) opted to maximize sugar exports during the period
of high international sugar prices. With the subsequent drop in sugar prices,
the limitations imposed on sugar exports by Brazil's quota under the Interna-
tional Sugar Agreement (about 2 million tons in 1978) and the sharp rise in
petroleum prices and the resultant creation of PROA:LCOOL in 1975, alcohol
production has been increasing sharply since 1977. In 1980, about 25-30% of
Brazil's total sugarcane production of 121 million tons were converted into
sugar for export, another 35-40% into sugar for the domestic market and the
remainder into alcohol. The recent production increases were achieved
primarily through full utilization of existing agricultural and industrial
production capacity and an increasing number of alcohol distilleries set up
under PROALCOOL after 1975.



-8-
3.02      Annual alcohol production has increased from 1.0 billion liters in
1977 to 3.4 billion liters in 1980, and is estimated to have reached 4.1 billion
liters in the crop season ending March 1981. Capacity utilization increased
sharply during 1975-1978 as idle capacity was quickly utilized. In each of
the future years a large number of new distilleries will come on stream so
capacity utilization will fluctuate in the 70-80% range overall during the
1981-85 period. Projects approved by CENAL until June 1980 will raise ethanol
capacity to 6.3 billion liters, in a total of 263 distilleries, of which 156
are "annexes" to sugar mills and 107 are "autonomous", i.e., produce no sugar.
Distilleries located in the Southeast will have an annual capacity of 4.0
billion liters (63% of total). While the Southeast still retains a major share
of total distilling capacity, there has been a shift in the recent past towards
the Northeast, which by 1985 could increase its share of total production to 28%
from only 17% in 1974, if the recent trends of new plant locations continue (para
3.05). Location (by State) of alcohol capacity approved through June 1980 is
shown in Map IBRD-15334.
B.   Projected Supply/Demand of Ethanol
3.03      PROALCOOL targets for alcohol production during 1980-85 are shown below:
Brazil - Alcohol Production and Consumption Targets 1980-85
(in billion liters)
Consumption
Gasoline Substitute

1980           3.4          0.3         0.2        2.9       3.1
1981           4.1          0.4         0.7        3.0       3.7
1982           5.5          0.8         1.8        2.9       4.7
1983           6.7          1.0         2.8        2.9       5.7
1984           8.5          1.2         4.5        2.8       7.3
1985          10.7          1.5         6.5        2.7       9.2
Of the 10.7 billion liters for 1985, 9.2 billion would substitute for gasoline
and 1.5 has been targeted for use as chemical feedstocks. Of the 9.2 billion
liters that will substitute for gasoline, 2.7 billion or 29% would be produced
as anhydrous alcohol and will be blended with gasoline at a concentration of
up to 20%. The remaining 71% (6.5 billion liters) will be produced as straight
(94%) alcohol and be used as the fuel in cars with all-alcohol engines. Pro-
duction targets are ambitious and it is likely that the actual 1985 production
level may be slightly below targets due to delays in bringing the planned new
agricultural facilities into production. Overall, there is no significant
adverse impact if targets were not met by 10-15% which would correspond to only
about one year delay in achieving targets and are likely to be offset by a slower
buildup in demand for chemical use. Therefore, the Alcohol Program is analyzed
on the basis of achieving targets, although, as noted, this level is considered
somewhat optimistic.
C.   Regional Ethanol Consumption and Production
3.04      Consumption of ethanol is gradually shifting to regions other
than the Southeast as shown in the following table:

The Southeast's share of consumption has dropped from about 100% in 1973 to about
82% in 1978 and is projected to decrease to about 65% in 1985. A regional and
statewise breakdown of gasoline use, sugarcane, cassava and alcohol production
is available in Project File, Exhibit A. The current and projected regional
supply/demand balance for ethanol based on current production and consumption
trends is summarized in the table below:

3.05      If alcohol production in the Northeast maintains the pace experienced in
recent past, the region would develop an increasingly large surplus since it has a
relatively low automobile population. The supply surplus could reach 1.3 billion
liters by 1985. The South (with little alcohol production) and the Southeast would
remain deficit even though a large alcohol production increase is planned for Sao
Paulo and Parana. Additional emphasis would need to be given to production increases
in Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais and Parana to minimize regional imbalances. CENAL is
aware of this emerging problem as well as the potential for land use conflict and
has planned steps to slow down the future expansion of alcohol capacity in the North-
east, while encouraging its location in the projected deficit areas. Proposals for
new alcohol projects reviewed since late 1980 already show impact of these efforts
and the share of new projects from Northeast has come down substantially. Regional
distribution of alcohol will be carefully assessed by the Monitoring and Evaluation
System to plan future distillery locations (para 8.06-8.10).
D.   Storage and Distribution of Ethanol
3.06       Individual alcohol distilleries are required to have product storage capa-
cities sufficient to permit alcohol sale at a uniform rate throughout the year. For
sugarcane-based and cassava-based distilleries the storage represents an average of
three months' and one month's production respectively. In addition, regional bulk
storage capacities for alcohol are being established by the petroleum industry by



- 10 -
modification of existing petroleum product tankage and by building new tanks at
a number of locations for subsequent distribution to consumption centers and
retail outlets. New storage capacity totalling 1.1 billion liters will be estab-
lished mainly by PETROBRAS, corresponding to about two months of the anticipated
1985 hydrous alcohol demand of 6.5 billion liters.
3.07      At present, PETROBRAS is receiving and blending into "gasohol" about
3 billion liters per year of anhydrous alcohol. PETROBRAS and other oil
companies have started, since late-1979, to develop the storage and distribution
system of hydrous alcohol with initial emphasis on major metropolitan centers.
As of mid-1980, 1,780 retail outlets for hydrous alcohol had been established
of which 1,536 or 86% were in Sao Paulo (990), Minas Gerais (209), Rio de
Janeiro (198) and Parana (139). The petroleum industry is expected to have no
major difficulty in achieving a satisfactory alcohol (both anhydrous and
hydrous) distribution system by 1985, which by then will also have started to
reach into more distant areas.
IV. PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY
A.   Main Biomass Raw Materials
4.01      Ethanol (or alcohol) can be produced from three main types of biomass
raw materials: (a) sugar-bearing materials (such as sugarcane, molasses, sweet
sorghum, etc.) which contain carbohydrates in sugar form; (b) starches (such as
cassava, corn, babassu, potatoes, etc.), which contain carbohydrates in
starch form; and (c) celluloses (such as wood, agricultural residues, etc.) for
which the carbohydrate molecular form is more complex. Production of ethanol
from these materials includes first (except in the case of sugars) conversion
of carbohydrates into water soluble sugars (since yeast can ferment only simpler
--6 or 12 carbon--sugars), then fermentation of these sugars into ethanol, and
finally separation of ethanol from water and other fermentation products by
distillation. The main attraction of sugar-bearing raw materials for alcohol
production lies in the fact that their carbohydrate content is already in the
fermentable, simpler sugar form such as glucose or fructose. Starches contain
carbohydrates of greater molecular complexity, which have to be broken down to
simpler sugars by a saccharification process, which adds another process step
and increases capital and operating costs.  Carbohydrates in cellulosic materials
have an even greater molecular complexity and have to be converted to fermentable
sugars by acid hydrolysis. However, some of the sugars so produced are not
fermentable to alcohol by yeast, reducing the overall carbohydrate-to-alcohol
conversion efficiency.
4.02      The table on page 11 shows ethanol yield per ton of the major potential
biomass raw materials, as well as estimated ethanol yields per hectare of
land for the average Brazilian situation.

B. Current Technology
4.03     Flow diagrams for ethanol production from sugarcane and cassava,
which are the main raw materials for conversion to ethanol to meet the targets
to 1985, are shown in Annex 4. Any sugar or starch, respectively, would be
processed in a similar way. Ethanol production from cellulose (wood), which
is not yet commercially proven and is not discussed here, is also a potential
source. Material and utility, and energy balances for sugarcane (based on
existing plants) and cassava (based on design parameters) are discussed in
Chapter VI of the report "Alcohol Production from Biomass: Potential and
Prospects in the Developing Countries", Report No. 3021 dated June 4, 1980.
4.04     Sugarcane, which is expected to provide 95% of the 1985 PROALCOOL target,
contains cellulose fiber intermixed with sugar in the sugarcane stalk. The cane
is washed and crushed, and filtered to separate the celullose ("bagasse") from sugar
juice. Bagasse is dried and burned to generate steam and power to supply all the
plant's utility requirements. The sugar juice is concentrated and sterilized and
then fermented in a batch fermentation system with yeast. The yeast is removed by
centrifuging, treated (to grow additional yeast) and recycled to the fermentation
step. Conventional alcohol technology uses batch fermentation with common strains
of yeast to produce an 8-10% alcohol solution, after 24-72 hours of fermenting.
The yeast is gradually rendered ineffective (due to the increasing alcohol concen-
tration) and 8-10% ethanol is the maximum practical concentration attainable in
batch systems. The fermented mash is sent to a stripping column to separate
ethanol (plus some water) from the fermentation solids and the bulk of the water
in the 8-10% alcohol solution. The waste stream, called stillage, contains about
10% solids, including 2-3% fertilizer nutrients, which must be disposed of pro-
perly to avoid potential environmental problems. The stream containing ethanol
is ther. distilled in a multistage distillation column to a concentration of about
94% ethanol. (Water and ethanol form an azeotrope or constant boiling mixture,
at 95% ethanol.) Anhydrous ethanol is produced in a third distillation column by
adding benzene (which eliminates the constant boiling mix at 95% ethanol) and then
further distillation permits production of anhydrous alcohol (99.8% purity).
Benzene is separated from anhydrous alcohol and is recycled. Anhydrous alcohol is
sent to storage and subsequently blended with gasoline or to other end-uses. If
hydrous or straight alcohol (94% ethanol) is the desired product, processing simply
eliminates the third distillation column with a resultant reduction in steam
and elimination of benzene requirements.



- 12 -
4.05      The basic process for other sugar materials is the same, though the
sizing of the fermentation and distillation units may be somewhat different depend-
ing on material balances and the raw material. Fermentation of molasses to 8-10%
alcohol solution normally takes 4-5 times longer than in the case of sugarcane.
Thus, to produce the same volume of alcohol, molasses-based plants require a much
larger number of fermentation tanks. This difference does not, however, lead to
any significant increase in the plant costs since such tanks represent a relatively
small proportion of total costs.
4.06      Starch-based plants are similar in design.  Cassava roots, which
contain 25-30% starch, are washed, peeled and liquefied in a cooker. The
liquefied starch is broken down into fermentable sugars by addition of enzymes,
amylase, and gluco-amylase. Once the fermentable sugars are formed, processing
is identical to the above-described steps for sugarcane beginning with fer-
mentation. Since cassava roots contain virtually no cellulose, there is no
"bagasse" formed and the heating requirements for a cassava-based alcohol plant,
which are slightly higher than for a sugarcane-based plant, must be supplied
from external sources. Other starch-bearing materials require essentially the
same processing equipment, although the plant front-end facilities must be
designed to meet requirements of particular crops.
4.07      The cellulosic materials of main interest for ethanol production in
Brazil are wood and agricultural crop residues. In general, processes involved
in alcohol production from them are more complex and larger scale than those
from sugars and starches. There are also no demonstrated processes available
yet for commercial scale plants. However, considerable development work is underway
in Brazil and it is possible that during the next decade cellulosic materials can
become an important biomass source of alcohol. Continued R & D in this area is
required to realize this potential.
C. Disposal of Byproducts and Environmental Impact
4.08      During the fermentation and distillation of ethanol, a number
of byproducts are produced. These are (i) carbon dioxide, which is produced
during fermentation; (ii) fusel oils, which are collected in the rectification
column; and (iii) stillage. Due to high recuperation costs, carbon dioxide is
usually not collected for sale and is normally discharged into the atmosphere
without any problem. Fusel oils (about 5 kg/l,O00 liters of ethanol) can be
collected for sale or blended into ethanol as fuel denaturant. 1/
4.09.      Stillage, the liquid effluent from the distillation system, can
potentially pose a major disposal problem. It is produced in large quantities,
about 10-13 times the volume of the alcohol produced, and if discharged
straight into waterways can be a serious pollution hazard (e.g., kill aquatic
life). It, however, does have economic uses since it contains protein as well as
fertilizer nutrients. The two main potential uses for stillage are: (i) animal
feed, and (ii) fertilizer. Stillage can be evaporated to about 50% solids and
mixed with feed concentrates, but the evaporation costs are relatively high and
the attractiveness of stillage as animal feed depends on the relative cost of
alternative feeds. In Brazil where the market for animal feed is small, this
end-use is normally not attractive. Stillage as fertilizer can be applied directly
on the soil by trucks or through an irrigation system. Since stillage is very
dilute (1% nitrogen, 0.2% phosphate and 1.5% potash) the volume to be transported
1/ Denaturant is an additive to alcohol which is difficult to separate and makes
mixture unfit for human consumption.



- 13 -
is large and use as fertilizer is viable in agricultural fields close to the
distillery. In many plantations, stillage is pumped to the top of neighboring
hills and gravity-fed to irrigation systems for surrounding fields. Surplus
steam from bagasse is used to power the pumps. Plant operators believe that it
is economical to use such a system in a radius of about 3 km around the distillery.
Excess stillage is trucked to fields further away and sprayed on the ground.
Apart from the trucks, this system does not require any supplementary equipment.
Cane yields are reported to have increased substantially on this land, due to
both the fertilizing and irrigation effects. Neither of the above two approaches
is likely to be a universal solution and additional technical development is
necessary to arrive at an optimum disposal technique in each case to minimize
environmental problems. Before approving any alcohol project, CENAL now requires
sponsors to incorporate satisfactory stillage disposal measures. The appraisal
criteria to be used for Bank financed alcohol projects will ensure that they
conform to adequate pollution control standards. The Technology Development
Component of the Project will also support further development of stillage
disposal technology (para 8.04).
D.   Future of Alcohol Technology
4.10      At present, alcohol production from biomass (mainly molasses and
sugarcane) is based on an old technology since the demand for ethanol for
potable and chemical uses is not very sensitive to processing costs. Therefore,
process and equipment design have not benefited from the recent advances in
the design and engineering of other chemical plants. However, with the
increasing interest in ethanol as a fuel, a large number of major engineering
companies, equipment manufacturers and other parties in Brazil and elswhere,
have initiated efforts to improve the technology base and design of alcohol
plants to improve their efficiency. Most of these efforts are focusing on
five major areas:
(a) Recent technical work has developed continuous fermentation tech-
nology (although not fully commercially demonstrated) to yield up
to 12% alcohol content liquor.  Additional microbiological research
and development work is underway on improving the yeast strains to
yield even higher alcohol concentration in the fermentation step.
This improved technology should ultimately result in substantial
reductions in energy requirements for ethanol production, since it
could yield up to 50% saving in the energy used in distillation
and at the same time decrease stillage volume by half at substan-
tially the same (or lower) capital costs than for conventional
plants. Another area being investigated is vacuum fermentation
which, by mutation of temperature-insensitive organisms, will
allow continuous withdrawal of alcohol in vapor form thereby re-
ducing equipment and energy requirements.
(b) It is also possible to improve the energy efficiency of ethanol
production through more efficient distillation and heat recovery
design, using engineering concepts commercially proven in other
chemical engineering industries. In addition, ethanol concentration
could be increased through absorption, vapor recompression, and/or
multiple effect evaporators, but these techniques would require
considerably more R&D efforts to develop into commercial practice.
These latter improvements would generally lead to added capital costs.
Other methods of separation being investigated include crystallization,
use of molecular sieves and reverse osmosis, all of which will have
advantages of reduced energy requirements.



- 14 -
(c) A third area of future technology development is utilization of
agricultural wastes for feedstock and/or fuel purposes, and develop-
ment of additional (and/or improved) crops as raw material. A major
constraint in cassava utilization is the need for an external fuel
source. Agricultural waste products could be used for fuel in
modified boiler designs. The boiler modifications would be rela-
tively simple (the steam system itself is simple with low pressure,
low capacity) but gathering and drying of most agricultural wastes,
which will be labor intensive, would require low cost labor and an
organization system similar to sugarcane harvesting.
(d) Alternative energy crops is a promising area for future
development of alcohol production from biomass. Typical crops
would be sweet sorghum, wood, babassu and other crops which pro-
duce a high yield of starch or sugar per hectare and also
produce a usable cellulose component for fuel. Considerable
industrial development and demonstration work, in addition to
significant technology development effort in the agricultural
research area to improve their yields and their rotation patterns,
is needed in order to make them commercially viable.
(e) Multi-crop and mini plants are being developed to use a combination
of biomass feedstocks (e.g., sugarcane and cassava or sweet sorghum)
to extend the alcohol production season and reduce the feedstock
cost; mini plants are of interest for remote locations and smaller
farmers (paras 5.05 and 5.06).
4.11      At present, there are more than 250 sugarcane-based distilleries in
Brazil ranging in size up to one million liters/day (in several trains) and
age ranging to pre-1950. The majority (in terms of capacity), however, have
been erected since 1975 and typically are of about 120,000 liters/day capacity,
and attached to sugar mills. These alcohol units were supplied by Brazilian
engineering and equipment manufacturers. Technology offered is conventional,
batch fermentation units. The major companies have the ability to upgrade the
technology. PROALCOOL has designed a technology development program to
encourage these and other public and private institutions to increase their
R&D effort in the above and other areas of alcohol technology. Specific areas
of the Brazilian R&D effort during the 1981-85 period are discussed in paras
5.01, 5.05, and 8.04.
V. THE 1981-85 ALCOHOL PROGRAM AND INVESTMENT COSTS
A.   Overall Sector Program
5.01      The 1981-85 National Alcohol Program (Project File, Exhibit B) consists
of: (i) construction of production facilities and related agricultural infrastruc-
ture to meet the 1985 alcohol production target of 10.7 billion liters, and to
lay the ground for the tentative target of 13.2 billion liters set for 1987; (ii)
technology development to (a) improve sugarcane and cassava-based as well as multiple-
feestock processing technologies; (b) improve agricultural yields, particularly of
crops complementary or alternative to sugarcane, such as cassava, sweet sorghum and
wood; (c) investigate vegetable oils as substitute for diesel; and (d) develop
alternative biomass energy forms such as charcoal, bagasse and agricultural wastes;
and (iii) building of demonstration plants to commercialize and adapt to Brazilian
conditions technologies for alternative biomass energy sources which are expected
to lead to substantial alcohol production in the post-1985 period (e.g., ethanol
from wood hydrolysis).



- 15 -
B.   Production Facilities
5.02      As of June 30,1980, Brazil's annual alcohol production capacity totalled
4.7 billion liters or about 44% of the 1985 production target of 10.7 billion
liters. In addition, about 1.6 billion liters of capacity (in 75 units with an
average capacity of 120,000 liters/day), already approved and currently under
implementation, is expected to be completed by the end of 1981. Due to the
harvesting pattern of the associated agricultural facilities, full utilization
of this total capacity (4.7 + 1.6 = 6.3 billion liters) will not be reached
till 1984. Generally, for new land and distillery, the optimum harvesting
pattern limits raw material availability to 60% the first year and 90% the
second year of operation, and 100% from the third year onwards. Annexed
distilleries can, however, operate at higher capacities because of availability
of molasses. The production build-up of the 6.3 billion liters capacity
taking into account production from annexed distilleries as well as the
limitations imposed by the agricultural system on autonomous distilleries is
expected to yield actual alcohol production levels somewhat below the target
set for 1982. The annual on-stream requirements to meet annual targets to 1985
are summarized below and detailed in Annex 5-1:

a/  Autonomous distilleries which do not have surplus molasses will require
an additional 20% land area (298,000 ha) for planting cane for the next
year's production, bringing total land requirements to 1.8 million ha.
To meet the production targets from 1983 through 1985 (i.e., beyond 1982),
Brazil will need to bring on stream an additional 253 distilleries with an
average capacity of 120,000 lpd. These units (in volume of alcohol produced)
are scheduled to be 95% sugarcane-based and 5% cassava-based.
5.03      The above facilities are assumed to be autonomous, i.e., independent
distilleries devoted exclusively to alcohol production. While a few sugar mills in
Brazil still have the opportunity to attach distilleries to use the molasses from
their sugar operation for alcohol production, their contribution to future alcohol
output will be marginal. The average implementation period for new, autonomous
alcohol facilities is conservatively estimated at 24 months; actual experience has
ranged between 14-28 months. Implementation of the additional 55 facilities and
their associated raw material supply base for the 1983 target will, therefore, need
to start by 1981, the 83 additional units required on-stream in 1984 by 1982, and
the 115 units needed for 1985 by 1983, to meet the annual targets.



- 16 -
5.04      Beyond 1985, the Government has indicated a tentative target of 13.2
billion liters of alcohol by 1987 (i.e., 2.5 billion liters more) with imple-
mentation of facilities needed to meet the additional requirements to be partly
included in the 1984-85 slice of the program. It is assumed in this report
that the additional 2.5 billion liters will be spread evenly over the two
years, thus setting annual alcohol production targets of 11.9 billion in 1986
and 13.2 billion in 1987. The additional facilities required to meet these
targets have also been included in the 1981-85 program, as shown below.

C.   Technology Development
5.05      Brazil needs to improve existing and develop new agricultural and
industrial technologies to diversify the geographic and raw material base of
alcohol production and to reduce its economic and social cost. Since sugarcane
is primarily grown on good agricultural land, it is highly desirable to develop
alternative biomass feedstocks such as cassava and wood which can be suitably
grown on marginal agricultural land. On the agriculture side, there is a need
to (i) improve yield and varieties of sugarcane; (ii) develop suitable varieties
of sweet sorghum; (iii) develop multiple cropping systems involving sugarcane
to increase the annual production period of alcohol above the present average
of 180 days/year; (iv) improve yield and varieties of cassava which can be
grown on commercial scale in various parts of the country; and (v) develop
know-how and technologies needed for commercial production of alcohol from
wood. While some work is being done, there is a need to accelerate this work
to provide raw materials, at acceptable economic and social cost for the
Alcohol Program in the late 1980s and beyond. On the industrial side, there
is scope for developing more energy-efficient alcohol plants based on existing
processes, for improving the technology (e.g., higher alcohol concentration
during fermentation, continuous fermentation and more efficient distillation),
and for developing plants capable of using more than one raw material (e.g.,
sugarcane plus cassava or sorghum). For cassava-based units, improvements are
needed to reduce capital costs and substantially improve energy balance.
Additional demonstration plants are needed before many investors would build
commercial cassava-based alcohol plants. There is need for a closer association
of experienced engineering firms and equipment manufacturers to develop adequate
designs and equipment for demonstration plants, including the import of some
technology (e.g., for wood-based alcohol). Overall, a slow build up of adequate
agricultural and industrial technology in Brazil could become a major constraint
to the long-term development of the Alcohol Program and to the efforts to reduce
the current virtual exclusive dependence on sugarcane as the raw material. Tech-
nology development is being promoted pricipally through two organizations--STI
and FINEP. These organizations and their programs are described in para 8.13.

6.02      The policy-making body for the National Alcohol Program is the
National Alcohol Commission (CNAL), comprising the Minister of Industry and
Commerce (Chairman), the Secretary-Generals of the Ministries of Agriculture,
Finance, Interior, Labor, Mines and Energy, and Planning, the Deputy Chief of
Technology of the Armed Forces General Staff and representatives from the
private sector (agriculture, commerce and industry).
6.03      Implementation of CNAL's policy decisions, as well as the planning,
regulation, approval for financing and monitoring of alcohol production
projects are carried out by the Executive Secretariat of the National Alcohol
Commission (CENAL). CENAL is headed by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of
Industry and Commerce (MIC), and includes the Chairm,en of the National Petroleum
Council (CNP) and the Institute of Alcohol and Sugar (IAA),the Secretary of the
Secretariat of Industrial Technology (STI) and the Executive Secretary of the
Industrial Development Council (CDI)--agencies that have day-to-day responsi-
bilities for the physical implementation of PROALCOOL. CENAL has a professional
staff of about 20 drawn mostly from MIC.
B.   Management
6.04      In carrying out its functions, CENAL relies heavily on the technical
expertise of the organizations represented on the Commission as well as other
government agencies. For the technical evaluation of sugarcane-based alcohol
projects, CENAL draws on the expertise of IAA, a well-developed institution
with local branches throughout the sugarcane-producirig regions of Brazil.
IAA has controlled the production, distribution and export of sugar in Brazil
over the last nine decades. Its current role in the Alcohol Program is a
natural extension of its past experience and responsibilities in the Brazilian
sugar industry. The technical evaluation of non-sugarcane-based alcohol
projects is carried out by the STI, a unit under MIC with responsibility for
promoting the development of all industrial technology in Brazil. Its principal
role in the Alcohol Program is to coordinate and finance the development of
technology for alcohol production from raw materials other than sugarcane and
develop uses other than for gasoline substitution. STI also finances and
monitors research undertaken by various public and private institutions on the
development of industrial processes and equipment, and on effluent treatment.
The Ministry of Agriculture, through its extension services agency (EMBRATER)
is charged with responsibility for ensuring that expansion of sugarcane plan-
tations for alcohol production does not displace food crops in accordance
with existing government policy (Article 9, CENAL Resolution 02/79, Policy and
General Guidelines for Implementation of PROALCOOL), which requires the
proposed alcohol plant owner to demonstrate to EMBRATER that land to be used
for producing raw materials for alcohol "does not displace other basic crops
grown for domestic and/or export market unless substantial comparative advantage
measured in terms of productivity can be established." Environmental and
pollution control guidelines are set by the Special Environmental Secretariat
(SEMA), which belongs to the Ministry of the Interior. The financial appraisal,
financing and supervision of alcohol projects are the responsibility of the
financial agents (national and regional banks). Their loans are in turn
refinanced by Banco Central do Brasil, the Central Bank of Brazil, from funds
earmarked for the Alcohol Program by the National Monetary Council (CMN).
6.05      Other public and private organizations are also indirectly involved,
particularly in the production of alcohol from sugarcane/molasses.  These
are the well-funded public and private organizations such as PLANASUCAR (the



- 20 -
R & D arm of IAA) and COPERSUCAR (the most important private sugar producers'
organization). Research to improve the yields and sugar content is also
undertaken by EMBRAPA and the agricultural departments of local universities.
The functions of and relationships between the various organizations involved
in the management of the Alcohol Program are summarized on the following page.
6.06      As the Alcohol Program becomes more complex and as the raw material
base expands beyond sugarcane, a much closer coordination would be required
among the various government agencies that are involved in the program. At the
policy making level, the Ministry of Agriculture has a major role to play not
only in questions of land use and participation of small farmers as part of the
Government's efforts to slow the rural-urban migration, but also in relation
to its research and extension efforts, through EMBRAPA and EMBRATER, to improve
yields of current and potential future alcohol feedstocks such as cassava, sweet
sorghum, and babassu. Similarly, the Instituto Brasileiro do Desenvolvimento
Florestal (IBDF), the national agency responsible for forestry development, has
a role in the development of wood as a potential alcohol feedstock. The current
organizational structure of CNAL provides for this greater coordination since it
includes the Secretary General of Agriculture, and the Government is aware of
the need to ensure that all concerned agencies actively participate in the
formulation of policies for the Program.
6.07      At the implementation level, the increasing complexity of the Pro-
gram requires broadening of the composition of CENAL and its staff to enlarge
the present experience pool to include expertise that would develop and/or
synthesize and review policy options relating to long-term issues of the
Program such as the alternative uses of the land devoted to sugarcane, cropping
patterns, land ownership concentration, participation of small farmers and
dispersal of new facilities to match potential local alcohol demand. Such a
broadening of CENAL's staff would also reduce the Secretariat's present heavy
dependence on IAA and STI--agencies, which while qualified to evaluate the
technical viability of projects submitted to the Commission for approval,
could, because of their stake in CENAL decisions, face increasing conflicts of
interest in the future. The envisaged size and mix of CENAL staff would have
to reflect the overall monitoring and evaluation requirements for the Program
(paras 8.05-8.10).
C.   PROALCOOL Appraisal Procedures
6.08      Project proposals with feasibility studies are submitted by the
private sponsors to CENAL, which in turn passes them on simultaneously to IAA
(or STI) for technical review, to SEMA for approval of effluent treatment/utili-
zation plans and to the sponsor's chosen financial agent for financial review.
In the past year, CENAL has improved its appraisal criteria and procedures,
though adequate economic analysis is not yet done for individual projects; but
CENAL is currently developing a set of coefficients which will be used to better
judge the economic viability of projects, particularly in the Northeast. The
IAA or STI technical review consists of an appraisal of the project's agri-
cultural parameters (climatic and agronomic conditions, current land use
and yields, land availability and estimated production schedule) and of its
industrial parameters (adequate infrastructure and utilities, proper stillage
disposal system, satisfactory selection of industrial process and equipment,
and competitive capital costs). The IAA consults its field agents concerned
in evaluating the agricultural aspects of sugarcane-based facilities; since
late-1980, CENAL also submits all subprojects to the state authorities for
their comments. The STI uses the Ministry of Agriculture staff in evaluating

agricultural aspects of the non-sugarcane-based facilities. SEMA uses its
state agencies to review effluent treatment/utilization aspects of projects.
Under Brazilian law (Portaria No. 153 of 1980), all alcohol projects must have
their effluent treatment/utilization plans approved, and inspected from time
to time by SEMA after implementation. Penalties for non-compliance include
rescission of loans and plant closure. The financial agents, which take full
responsibility for project financing, apply the same appraisal criteria as for
other investment proposals. They study in particular the project owners'
creditworthiness (assessment of current financial situation and outstanding
long-term debt), and the experience and technical competence of the proposed
project management team. If the project is to obtain some of its raw materials
from independent farmers, they (the financial agents) require in addition that
adequate supply contracts be provided. After they receive CENAL's project
approval and authorization for financing, the financial agents finalize their
evaluation, provide the initial disbursement on the loan and submit the project
proposal, a summary of their appraisal and disbursement documentation to Banco
Central for reimbursement from PROALCOOL funds. The two major financial agents
involved in the Alcohol Program--Banco do Brasil and Banco National de Desen-
volvimento Economico (BNDE)--now generally approve alcohol projects in about 120
days. The appraisal procedures and approval criteria (Project File, Exhibits E
and F) are considered adequate to ensure that (i) alcohol projects are approved
after a thorough review of their managerial, technical and financial parameters;
and (ii) the Alcohol Program is not delayed by unduly lengthy approval proce-
dures. Under the Project, the appraisal procedures will be further strengthened
to incorporate economic analysis and a more detailed assessment of land use,
social and environmental factors (paras 7.21, and 8.11).
VII. IMPACT OF ALCOHOL PROGRAM ON AGRICULTURE
A.   Opportunities and Challenges
7.01      Alcohol production from biomass presents significant opportunities
and challenges for Brazilian agriculture. Simultaneous with a rapid build-up
of biomass feedstock for alcohol, continued attention would need to be given
to expanding agricultural output for providing adequate and reasonably priced
domestic food supplies and for exports. Decisions concerning the agricultural
land allocations for meeting the 1985 alcohol production target of 10.7 billion
liters must be taken during the next two years or so, considering the lead time
required to develop new sugarcane production. Present policy is to approve alco-
hol projects only if they do not divert cultivated land from other crops into
sugar/alcohol production (Project File, Exhibit F). This policy is designed to
prevent "food vs fuel" from becoming a serious problem in Brazil in the medium
term. The appraisal procedures to be adopted for the proposed Project will assist
in the enforcement of this policy. However, since the 1985 target requires about
1.8 million additional hectares of sugarcane land and could lead to changes in
cropping patterns (paras 7.07 and 7.14), it is important that the Government
carefully monitor the impact of PROALCOOL on the agriculture sector.
7.02     Considering that major concerns about the impact of the Alcohol Program
on the agricultural sector relate to much higher alcohol production targets likely
to be set for the period beyond 1985 and that the actions needed in the agricultural
sector to mitigate such concerns must be taken now, this chapter after reviewing
the capabilities to meet the 1985 target also focuses on the longer term policy
implications of such likely higher alcohol production targets.

B. Alcohol Production and Land Requirements
7.03      The alcohol production target of 10.7 biLlion liters for 1985 represents
a tripling of the 1980 production level of 3.4 billion liters, which will require
a substantial increase in the land area devoted to sugarcane, as summarized on the
following page and detailed in Project File, Exhibit G:

a/ Sugarcane and alcohol year ends April 30.
b! All alcohol up to 1975 was from molasses, thus land allocation was zero.
Land requirements for subsequent years take into account increased availa-
bility of molasses for alcohol production due to increased sugar production.
c/  Excludes additional area under cultivation in 1985 for additional alcohol
to be produced in 1986. Data for 1978-1982 include the additional area
under cultivation for the next years' incremental alcohol production.
In 1980, sugarcane occupied 2.9 million ha, with 1.6 million ha devoted to sugar
production and 1.3 million ha to alcohol (including 0.3 million ha in new planting
area for increased 1981 alcohol production). The amount of additional cane area
required to meet the 1985 alcohol target depends on several key assumptions. CENAL
estimates the required area increase to be 1.4 million ha, assuming yields increase
from a current level of 55 tons per ha per year to 60 tons on existing sugarcane
plantations (new areas are estimated at 50 tons per ha) and processing efficiency
from 70 to 80 liters of alcohol per ton of sugarcane. These combined productivity
increases would result in an increase in alcohol production per ha of 25% over
1979/80 levels (from 3,850 to 4,800 liters/ha). Thiese estimates appear to be
somewhat optimistic. Land needs are further underestimated by not including
the 20-25% of the total area under cane that is not harvested during the
planting year. Assuming that alcohol productivity increases of 8-9% by 1985
are more likely, the additional land required to meet 1985 total production
targets for alcohol would be about 1.8 million ha over and above the current
sugarcane area (para 5.02).
7.04      This additional land area for sugarcane production is expected to
come from: (i) expansion of sugarcane area already cropped by existing sugar
mills; (ii) new autonomous distillery projects already approved; and (iii) pro-
jects yet to be approved. Limited availability of land (in part through
restrictions on land use patterns and ownership) and limitations on hauling
distance are expected to restrict expansion by existing mills to about
150,000 ha; for most of this area, management and most of the infrastructure



- 24 -
investments are already in place.  An additional 800,000 ha would come from
new projects that are to be implemented in the next two years. The remaining
required area of about 850,000 ha are yet to be incorporated in individual
projects.
7.05      Development of these 1.8 million ha in the 1981-85 time period would
be a formidable task. Harvest is only possible during the second year following
planting, and four years are needed for complete use of total area. If land
must first be cleared, then an additional year must be added to the development
period. Therefore, about 400,000-500,000 ha of new sugarcane production must
be established each year in 1981-84 to meet the target, compared with a growth
in sugarcane area during 1979 and 1980 of about 300,000 ha/year. Still,
considering Brazil's total available land area and previous experience, the
1981-84 expansion rate is not an unusually high growth rate. Brazil has
accommodated rapid transformation in agricultural areas before.  During
1973-78, the soybean area increased by 4.2 million ha, an annual rate of
833,000 ha/yr, which is twice the annual increase in sugarcane needed to meet
the 1985 target.
C.   Agricultural Production Costs
7.06      The costs of expanding the cane area will vary for each region,
depending on the needed land development activities and existing farm infra-
structure. An investment level in machinery and other installations of about
US$500/ha is estimated for Sao Paulo. Assuming that some farms will already
have machinery and other equipment, a range from a few dollars to over
US$500/ha may apply to any given situation. Development costs in new areas
are likely to be considerably greater. Farm gate economic production costs
(August 1980 prices and exchange rates) for sugarcane are estimated to range
from about US$7.50 to 12.25/ton of cane produced. Estimates of US$7.50-8.50/ton
apply in the Southeast and the South and US$12.25/ton in the Northeast. Cost
estimates are detailed in Project File, Exhibit H and summarized in the table

D. Impact on Land Use
7.07      Brazil has one of the most favorable man-land ratios in the world.
Still, concerns exist about the future impact of the Alcohol Program on land
use, and in particular, the effects on production arnd costs of food crops,
particularly after 1985. Production of some basic food crops (beans, cassava,
rice) in Brazil appear to have lagged behind population growth in recent
years. These effects, however, cannot be attributed to sugarcane production
only, since crops such as soybeans have also demonst:rated spectacular growth
and adverse weather has affected production. Clearly, if major increased
demands are put on the land resources by the alcohol and other agricultural
programs, some adjustments in cropping patterns will be required. These
adaustments should be viewed within the overall potential for expansion of
land use at both the intensive and extensive margins. Also, the regional
distribution of future alcohol facilities will be iriportant in determining the
adjustments in land use patterns.
7.08      The Government has so far played a limitecd role in the location of
alcohol production plants. Strong investment incentives, coupled with industrial
know-how and capital production capacity has resulted in initial alcohol pro-
duction emphasis on sugarcane as an energy feedstock in traditional sugar production
areas, and in association with existing sugar mills. This has allowed a rapid
build-up of alcohol production capacity, but has simultaneously raised issues
of proper long-run land use, especially in terms of food and export crop compe-
tition in the central Sao Paulo state and the Northeast.
7.09      Brazil has vast land resources, so it is helpful to put the Alcohol
Program's needs in perspective to the availability and present use of the
land resource. The 1975 census is the latest data source for estimating
the use of land in Brazil. The area in temporary and permanent crops
increased from 34 million ha in 1970 to 40 million ha in 1975, an increase
of 18%. There was also an increase of 18% between 1960 and 1970. Expansion
of land area has been proceeding in the late 1970s, especially for soybeans and
sugarcane. Thus, present land use in crops is estimated around 46 million ha.
Of this, about 6% (2.9 million ha) was under sugarcane in 1980. An additional
1.8 million ha would, as mentioned, need to be incorporated into sugarcane during
the next four years to meet PROALCOOL targets.
7.10      The impact of the Alcohol Program on land use will vary from state
to state depending on the current use of the land suitable for sugarcane; such
potential land includes land currently under crops, planted pastures and
natural pastures. A breakdown of land use by state and region is presented in
Annex 7-1. One-half of the total crop land is in four states: Rio Grande do
Sul, Parana, Sao Paulo, and Minas Gerais. In the context of the present concerns
over food and export crop substitution in Sao Paulo, it is interesting to note that
Sao Paulo is only third in total crop land. Furthermore, planted pasture, a less
intensive use of potential crop land, actually exceeds crop land area in Sao
Paulo, indicating that substantial expansion of crop land area in Sao Paulo is
still possible. Minas Gerais and Parana have somewhat less expansion possibil-
ities through substitution of planted pasture and Rio Grande do Sul has largely
exhausted this potential. On a national basis, planted pasture area equals crop
land area, a substantial resource for further crop expansion. The availability
is greater in the Center West, about average in the Southeast and below average
in the South. In addition, another 126 million ha of natural pasture is available.
This cattle land resource is of varying quality and while some is undoubtedly
suitable for cultivation, no estimate of this potential is available.



- 26 -
7.11      Land requirements for all alcohol projects approved through June 30,
1980 (5.6 billion liters) are 1.6 million hectares or 2% of the crop and
planted pasture land or about 4% of crop land. This percentage is higher in
the Northeast and Southeast where most of the early projects have been approved.
Historically, sugarcane cultivation has largely been confined to four coastal
states in the Northeast (Alagoas, Bahia, Ceara and Pernambuco) and three states
in the Southeast (Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo) due to their
favourable soil and climatic conditions. These seven states account for about
93% of sugarcane growing in Brazil; during 1975-77 when the total area under
sugarcane in Brazil expanded by about 15%, the Northeast accounted for 55% and the
Southeast 45% of the increase. With sugarcane currently as the primary feedstock
for alcohol, the distribution of the estimated 1.6 million land area required for
alcohol projects approved to June 30, 1980 has conformed to this historical pattern.
About 75% of the land requirements (1.2 million ha) for these approved projects are
located in these seven states: 458,000 ha in the four Northeastern states and 700,000
ha in the Southeastern states. The impact of PROALCOOL on land use, land tenure and
crop production in the two regions could therefore be substantial and will thus need
to be closely monitored by CENAL.
7.12      The total land requirements of 2.7 million ha for meeting the 1985
alcohol production target are equivalent to 6% of the current crop land
and 3% of the current crop and planted pasture land. A detailed analysis of
land use patterns by states, given in Annex 7-1, shows that overall, except
for the two smaller states of Amapa and Alagoas, the Alcohol Program's land
requirements are manageable compared to total agricultural land availability,
provided careful monitoring of the requirements within each state is undertaken
to avoid over-concentration in a few areas. Towards this end, the Government
has initiated land use studies for each state; these studies discuss in detail
the current land use pattern and the potential use for various crops, and identify
areas where alcohol-related agricultural crops can be grown without any adverse
impact on food and/or export crop production (Project File, Exhibit I). Eight of
these studies have already been completed; the rest are due for completion by end-
1981. As an outgrowth of these studies, the state Governments now also examine
land use implications of alcohol projects within their states and forward their
comments to CENAL within 30 days of receipt of such proposals (para 6.C08). The
appraisal procedures agreed under the Project will require an adequate review of
the present land use implications prior to approval of the projects by CENAL.
7.13      The likely effect of Brazil's Alcohol Program on land use in the medium
term can be summarized as follows. In the immediate future the concentration of
sugarcane production in the vicinity of the alcohol distilleries would most likely
change existing land use patterns. In the traditional sugarcane producing areas
of Sao Paulo, the expansion of cane would displace food and export crops which will
move to other parts of the region, while cane expansion in the newer areas in
western Sao Paulo and northern Parana will be more in traditional livestock areas
and would displace pasture land. Since CENAL and state authorities are authorizing
new alcohol plants mainly in these newer areas, they are not expected to adversely
affect food crop production. In the Northeast, however, where it is less likely that
expansion could utilize pasture land, the potential impact on food production could
be considerable, and projects proposed there will be subjected to a particularly



- 27 -
careful analysis. As mentioned, CENAL is aware of this conflict and has started to
de-emphasize projects in the Northeast (para 3.05).
7.14      Overall, since Brazil has considerable underutilized agricultural land,
the increase in alcohol production to 1985 should not necessarily result in a net
reduction in production of traditional crops, but will most likely cause changes
in cropping patterns in some areas with some marginal increases in the cost of
production for displaced agricultural activities that move to new and more distant
areas. Thus, the 1985 alcohol production target of 10.7 billion liters, if properly
administered, could be achieved without materially affecting food or export crop
production. Careful monitoring by CENAL will, however, be required in the expansion
in sugarcane land to assure that food/export crop production is not adversely
affected. Early identification and minimization of such adverse effects would
be key objectives of the proposed Monitoring and Evaluation System.
7.15      Beyond 1985, as higher alcohol targets are established and new feed-
stocks become more important, the impact of the Alcohol Program is likely to be more
widely dispersed geographically and will potentially have relatively more positive
employment and income effects in other regions. This situation would force greater
competition for agricultural resource uses in all areas and more clearly focus the
food-fuel issues. The technical and economic feasibility of using productively the
vast cerrado in central Brazil and the frontier areas of Mato Grosso and the North
for further food or energy crop production then become key determinants of the
longer-run potential of Brazil's biomass program. The need becomes apparent for
effective agricultural research to permit development of these areas, including soil
conservation, analysis of changing cropping patterns as well as required agricultural
policy to promote these areas. In this context, the Bank is supporting Brazil's
agricultural research efforts under the ongoing Agricultural Research I project
(Loan 1249-BR); it is proposed to expand this assistance under a second agricultural
research project expected to be presented to the Board of Executive Directors in
calendar 1981. This proposed project will have among its objectives (i) the
development of a national inventory of biomass energy raw materials which can be
converted into usable premium energy; (ii) improvement of biomass energy raw material
yields; and (iii) development of appropriate agricultural systems in and expansion
of the agricultural frontier areas.
E. Ownership Concentration
7.16      Another question associated with PROALCOOL is the extent to which the
Program encourages further concentration of ownership in the sugar industry.
Sugarcane has been produced traditionally within a tightly controlled, vertically
integrated production-processing industry. Sugar mills are required by law to
purchase one-half of their cane from owners of private sugarcane farms although
this has not always occurred in practice. While the tonnage of cane provided
by outside suppliers has increased, the proportion of the total which they
supply continues to fall. In 1977-78, only 14% was purchased from independent
suppliers. The number of sugar mills declined from 276 to 206 between 1966 and
1978 while the tonnage of cane processed at each mill rose from an average of
about 180,000 tons/yr to 490,000 tons/yr during this peariod.
7.17      Census data indicates a relationship between sugarcane production
and large farms (Annex 7-1, page 4). It also demonstrates that cassava, the
primary alternative crop for future alcohol expansion, is concentrated on
small farms. However, cassava production for alcohol may not necessarily
follow the present farm structure of small size and predominantly hand labor.



- 28, -
In 1975, 81% of the cassava area was found on farms of less than 50 hectares.
For all crops the level was 45% and for sugarcane only 15%. Most sugarcane
area (70%) was found on farms with more than 200 hectares. Small-scale
distilleries that can serve isolated locations and the smaller farm structure
in most areas of Brazil is one alternative which will receive support under
the Technology Development Component of the Project.
7.18      Data on the specific impact of the Alcohol Program on land ownership
concentration does not exist since the Program was started only in 1975 and
its effective implementation began only in 1978. However, during the 1970-75
period in which the crop area expanded by 18%, largely as a result of the soy-
bean program, it is evident that farm size was not changing. The number of
farms in all size categories remained relatively constant (Annex 7-1, page 4).
The expansion occurred through larger crop acreages on the larger farms,
presumably as a result of crop land being substituted for pasture land. The
cropped area did not change for farms under 50 hectares in size, but it in-
creased 20% for farms between 50 and 200 hectares, 40% for those between 200
and 1,000 hectares and 80% for those over 1,000 hectares. Thus, concentration
in production during this period was more from intensification of cropping
activities on large farms, rather than by acquisition of smaller farms.
7.19      Both cane production equipment and refining and distilling equipment
are designed and produced in Brazil by a small number of firms concentrated
in the Sao Paulo area. The cane production structure is protected and sus-
tained by a price support and production quota system. This combination of
policies and large firm vertical integration has given considerable stability
to the sugar industry in Brazil. Geographical distribution of sugarcane
production has also been restricted largely to two areas, Sao Paulo and the
Northeast. These developments were necessary for quickly increasing alcohol
production. However, in the future, greater attention would need to be given
to alternative crop and combination cropping systems, to varied size
distilleries and to the matching of regional alcohol production with liquid
fuel demand and with land and labor availability.
F.   Alternative Crops
7.20      Several crops other than sugarcane are being investigated as poten-
tial feedstocks for Brazil's Alcohol Program, but much of this work is at an
early stage of development. Each alternative has particular characteristics
that may allow (i) competitive substitution for sugarcane; (ii) complementary
use together with sugarcane; and (iii) regional production in non-sugarcane
areas. The principal crops now being considered are cassava, sweet sorghum,
wood and babassu, which are briefly described in Annex 7-2. Current plans
call for an increasing portion of the additional alcohol production beyond
1985 to come from cassava, though yields must be increased substantially if
cassava is to compete economically with sugarcane. Sweet sorghum holds
potentially great promise in areas where multiple cropping is possible and
as an off-season complementary input to sugarcane distilleries. Babassu is
also a potential source but requires additional technical work before its econo-
mic viability can be assessed.   The Project will assist in the development of
these alternative energy crops (para 8.04).
G.  Agricultural Policy and Alcohol Production
7.21      As discussed several key agricultural policy issues relate to the over-
all Alcohol Program. They include determination of regional production possi-
bilities and need to balance regional alcohol supply and demand, impact on land



- 29 -
use and crop displacement, reduction in the cost of production of energy feed-
stock, source and region, and development of appropriate scale technology
to best suit regional conditions. Perhaps the most important is the need to
increase crop yields and identify new raw material sources to maximize the
potential alcohol yield from several feedstocks while minimizing the impact
on food and export crops. Since Brazil has widely different regional possi-
bilities and needs in alcohol production and use, most policies and programs
will have a regional focus. The Monitoring and Evaluation System being developed
as part of the Project will address these issues and allow more specific
regional and alternative crop planning (paras 8.05 -- 8.10). With respect to the
concerns regarding land use, food crop production, ownership concentration, rural
employment and the environment, the appraisal criteria under the Project are
being strengthened to explicitly take these into account in approving alcohol
production projects. Agreement has been obtained from the Government that, under
the Project, (i) alcohol projects will not be located in traditional sugarcane
growing areas except when sponsored by small-farmer cooperatives, and (ii) should
the Bank determine that a production sub-project would have, or is having a
material and adverse impact on employment, land ownership by small farmers or
rights of tenant farmers to land, food crop production or the environment, Bank
financing would be suspended.
7.22      The principal challenge is to look beyond the existing sugarcane
industry to incorporate alcohol deficient areas in the Alcohol Program and to
define more clearly the economic and other trade-offs in terms of transpor-
tation costs, food production, resource use, and regional income distribu-
tional and employment impacts. This assessment must include a consideration of
alternative energy crops, such as cassava, wood and sweet sorghum, that are more
widely adapted to regional soil, moisture and climatic conditions, the adaptation
of sugarcane varieties to new area conditions, the development of different
scale processing plants to reflect the supply characteristics of different
crops and regions, increase the participation of smaller farmers, and the
design of processing plants to permit multiple feedstocks in combination to
allow a longer processing season.  Of the alternative crops, cassava may be one
of the more immediate possibilities, although its reLative importance will
remain small for the next several years. Cassava can be harvested year round
in some areas or chipped, dried and stored for off-season processing. Since
cassava is grown principally as a subsistence crop on small plots with little
improved technology, the potential productivity under commercial conditions
is unknown. With appropriate research, the probable expansion areas in which
cassava could potentially serve as a principal energy feedstock are the Northeast
in the agreste or semi-arid region, the Center West on the cerrado soils and
the South where considerable cassava is now produced on small farms. It is
unlikely that cassava will compete successfully with sugarcane as an energy
feedstock in traditional sugar areas in the near future.
7.23      Expanded efforts in research and development in both raw material
production and processing will be required to meet regional needs and promote
national development objectives for PROALCOOL. In the next several years, lead
times between investment and output growth will be longer and results some-
what slower than in the past five yars.  However, with success in these
efforts, regional income disparities can be lessened, pressure on food crop
production reduced, and incomes and employment in the! poorer agricultural
areas increased. In the broadest perspective, the challenge to agricultural



- 30 -
policy vis-a-vis the Alcohol Program is to develop technologies and production
systems that can accommodate the rising energy costs on the production side
yet provide greatly expanded output to meet the multiple demands for energy
feedstocks, domestic food and export crops within the context of productive
efficiency and distributional equity.
VIII. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
8.01      The Project is designed to support the Government in its efforts
to develop an economic renewable source of energy as a substitute to imported
petroleum products. The basic objectives of the Project are to help (i) fi-
nance agricultural and industrial production facilities to meet the 1985
alcohol production target; (ii) improve existing technology and commercialize
new technology necessary to expand the geographic and biomass raw materials base
for alcohol production in the late 1980's; (iii) develop new biomass energy pro-
duction and consumption technology; and (iv) initiate studies, on an ongoing basis,
to analyze the broader impact of PROALCOOL on the agricultural, industrial,
transportation and energy sectors. During its involvement in the Project, the
Bank will continue its policy dialogue with the Government initiated during
Project identification and appraisal. Finally, by participation in PROALCOOL,
the Bank can help transfer the Brazilian experience to other member countries.
B.  Project Scope
8.02      The Project comprises the 1981-83 time slice of the 1981-85
Alcohol Program and consists of three major components:
(a)  Production Component which includes about 250 alcohol production
units which are expected to be approved by CENAL during 1981-83.
In addition to these units which will be based on commercially
proven technology, this component will also include a few demon-
stration units for commercialization of new technology, such as
alcohol production from wood and cellulose residues, or charcoal
and chemicals from wood;
(b)  Technology Development Component to support the biomass technology
development program now underway in Brazil and being coordinated
by STI and FINEP; and
(c)  Monitoring and Evaluation System being developed by CENAL, for
systematically monitoring and evaluating the impact of the Alcohol
Program, particularly on the agriculture, transport and energy
sectors, and for planning its future development.
8.03      The units in the Production Component will provide about 5.6 billion
liters or 52% of the 10.7 billion target of 1985. About 95% of these new
units are expected to be sugarcane-based and the remaining cassava-based.
The typical size of a unit will be 120,000 lpd of alcohol, although some could
be as large as 800,000 lpd and as small as 10,000 lpd. The locations of the
units are not yet identified, but the Government will continue to emphasize a
shift away from the concentration of alcohol production in the Northeast to
the Center West and the Southeast.
8.04      The demonstration units and Technology Development Component will
support development of technology necessary to (i) reduce the current heavy
dependence of PROALCOOL on sugarcane and good agriculture land, by developing
alcohol production from alternative biomass sources; (ii) diversify the



- 31 -
geographic base of alcohol production; (iii) involve smaller farmers and
entrepreneurs; and (iv) further improve the efficiency of existing alcohol
production and use. Demonstration units will prove new technologies on a
commercial scale. One wood-to-ethanol sub-project, with a minimum capacity
of 30,000 lpd is already in the feasibility stage and has received initial
approval from CENAL. Additional demonstration units involving also other
raw materials, such as cassava and sweet sorghum, are expected to be approved
during the 1981-83 period. All the demonstration tnits are expected to involve
some imported technology. The sub-projects in the Technology Development
Component will emphasize (i) development of alternative energy sources (e.g.,
vegetable oils) as substitute for diesel; (ii) improved biomass production
technology and yields; (iii) improved conversion of biomass into useful energy
forms (including mini-distilleries suited to small farmer participation); (iv)
conversion of industrial residues into useful energy forms and improved pollution
control; (v) utilization of biomass products (e.g. tests on use of ethanol in
stationary engines); and (vi) technical assistance to industry.   About 50-60
sub-projects ranging from basic research to specifi'c technical improvements in
production technology are expected to be approved cluring the 1981-83 time slice.
The projected annual programs of STI and FINEP for technology development will be
reviewed and agreed with the Bank each year on the basis of the previous year's
performance.
8.05      The present Alcohol Program has a loosely defined Evaluation and
Monitoring System which in some areas is insufficient for proper assessment
of the broader socio-economic aspects and for long--range planning. The Alcohol
Program is based on private sector initiative, with financial incentives and
price controls, and emphasizes rapid production increases. Specific projects
are promoted by private sponsors based on their own considerations regarding
such factors as location, experience, profit expectations, etc. As discussed
in para 6.08, each project proposal is reviewed by CENAL with the assistance
of other organizations. While this system is satisf'actory for approving individual
projects and for ensuring rapid production expansicin with only technically and
financially viable projects being approved, it does not provide for a thorough
review of the project's broader economic and social impact. The current system
also does not allow for an evaluation of the macro impact of the Alcohol Program
on the agricultural, industrial and energy sectors, and on broader socio-econo-
mic issues such as food and export crop production, and employment and income
distribution. Equally important, it does not provide an appropriate framework
for long-term planning and periodic objective evaluation of the impact of
the Program on other parts of the economy and on broader socio-economic
issues.
8.06      The Bank is assisting CENAL in the develcpment of a Monitoring and
Evaluation System that will allow a continuous monitoring and evaluation of
the overall impact of the Alcohol Program. The monitoring component of the
system is to provide the Government, on an ongoing basis, with a comprehensive
analysis of the following areas as they relate to the Alcohol Program: (i) energy
and alcohol supply and demand; (ii) alcohol input and output pricing; (iii) em-
ployment effects; (iv) location of new distilleries; (v) impact on agriculture
and land use; (vi) distributional impact; and (vii) environmental impact.
8.07      The evaluation component of the system will provide the Government
with an in-depth assessment of broader issues such as whether the Program's
objectives are being achieved, the effectivenes of implementation strategies,
resource allocation, long-term impact on land use, rural employment, food and



- 32 -
export crop production, energy and alcohol demand, technology development, feas-
ibility of incorporating new biomass energy raw materials into the Program,
risks, etc., with policy recommendations for the future direction of the
Alcohol Program.
8.08     The monitoring function of the Monitoring and Evaluation System will
be set up under CENAL with the full cooperation of the Ministries of Agriculture,
Mines and Energy and Industry and Commerce, and other agencies. A detailed
description of the underlying needs for the establishment of the monitoring
function and the terms of reference for the variables to be monitored, which have
been agreed on with the Government and CENAL, are presented in Annex 8-1. CENAL
does not currently have the capacity to execute this function, and has agreed to
retain a consulting organization whose qualifications are acceptable to the Bank
to assist it to carry out the exercise during the Project implementation period;
the Government has further agreed to take all necessary measures to enable CENAL
to continue this activity beyond the Project implementation period. Presentation
of a satisfactory monitoring design an d contracting of a suitable organization
to assist CENAL to carry out this function is a condition of loan effectiveness.
The evaluation activity will be a biennial exercise to be carried out by an
independent consulting organization whose qualifications are acceptable to the
Bank. The first evaluation exercise is planned to be completed by December 31,
1982; its terms of reference (Annex 8-2) have been agreed on with the Government
and CENAL; presentation to the Bank by CENAL of a satisfactory design of and
contract for its execution is a condition of loan effectiveness.
8.09    The information generated by the system would be used to prepare
periodic overall evaluations of the Alcohol Program including recommendations
on future policies, production targets, and on any corrective measures needed
regarding the impact on agriculture and energy sectors and the environment.
Assurances have been received from the Government that CENAL will design and
implement a Monitoring and Evaluation System, furnish the Bank with copies of
the reports and periodically discuss the findings with the Bank.
8.10    In addition to the on-going work on monitoring and evaluation described
above, there is an urgent need to carry out a review of the impact of the
Alcohol Program to date on land use, food and export crop production, employ-
ment, environment and land ownership concentration within the influence area
of PROALCOOL distilleries as a basis for policy decisions since very little
substantive data is currently available on the agricultural and social impact
of the Program. The Government has already contracted a suitably quaLlified
independent consulting organization to carry out this impact study, the
results of which are expected by December 31, 1981. The results will be used
to prepare recommendations for policies designed to minimize any possible
negative impact of the Alcohol Program. The Government has agreed to furnish
copies of the study to the Bank when completed, and to exchange views on the
findings thereof.
C. Implementation
8.11    The general approach to implementing the Project will be to utilize
to the extent feasible the existing Brazilian institutions and procedures
described in Chapter IV. The Production Component will be implemented in
accordance with the PROALCOOL approval system described in para 6.04. Pro-
duction sub-projects for Bank financing will be submitted to the Bank by Banco
Central and will be appraised in accordance with the existing criteria
established by CENAL and Banco Central. The first ten production sub-projects
using conventional technology and all demonstration units to commercialise new



- 33-
technology to be financed by the Bank will be subject to prior Bank review and
approval; authorization for Bank financing of remaining sub-projects in this
component will be subject to satisfactory appraisal by Banco Central and ex poste
review by the Bank. A standard format for presentation to the Bank of Banco Central
appraisal and documentation of production sub-projects is presented in Annex 8-3.
As discussed in para 6.08, the existing appraisal criteria are adequate for en-
suring that production sub-projects are approved after a thorough review of their
managerial, technical and financial parameters, but do not incorporate adequate
economic evaluation and detailed assessment of land use, and environmental
and social factors. Assurances have been received from the Government and
Banco Central that the existing criteria will be modified to include evaluation
of the opportunity value of land proposed to be used for alcohol production as
well as the economic viability of the sub-project indicated by an economic rate
of return; these modifications will become effective by December 31,1981.
Production sub-projects with economic -rates of return of less than 11% will not
be eligible for financing under the Bank loan. In addition to the economic
evaluation, Banco Central and the financial agents will take into account such
social factors as the impact of the sub-project on employment, land ownership
by small farmers or rights of tenant farmers to land, food crop production, and
the environment (para 7.21). The Government has agreed to inform the Bank of
any significant changes in the appraisal criteria, and to exchange views with
the Bank annually on their adequacy.
8.12      To ensure that the broad objectives for the Bank's participation in the
Alcohol Program are met, in selecting production sub-projects for Bank financing,
preference will be given to (i) sub-projects sponsored by small-farmer cooper-
atives, small producers' associations and small-scale entrepreneurs; (ii) sub-
projects proposing to use agricultural raw materials other than sugarcane for
feedstock; (iii) sugarcane-based sub-projects purchasing 50% or more of their
sugarcane from independent suppliers; (iv) sub-projects enabling regional
dispersion of alcohol facilities; (v) sub-projects whose proposed locations
would tend to reduce alcohol transport costs; and (vi) sub-projects involving
the use of non-conventional technology.
8.13      Technology development sub-projects will be evaluated by STI and
FINEP in accordance with appraisal criteria agreed on with the Bank.
Any technology development sub-project with a cost larger than US$1.0 million
will require prior approval by the Bank. A standard format for presentation
of appraisal and documentation for technology sub-projects is presented in
Annex 8-3, page 2. STI and FINEP are considered suitable agencies for promoting
and evaluating technology sub-projects and for channelling Bank funds for the
Technology Development Component.  As discussed in Chapter VI, STI is a unit
under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Within the Alcohol Program, STI is
responsible for the development of policy options, technology extension services,
standards and quality control, and coordination of the industrial research and
technology relating to crops other than sugarcane (e.g., cassava, sweet sorghum
and babassu). FINEP is a public financial institution supervised by the Secreta-
riat of Planning of Brazil (SEPLAN). Its main activities are financing of pre-
investment studies, basic and applied research, transfer of foreign technology
to Brazil, and the development of new technologies by Brazilian enterprises.
FINEP is the main source of foreign and local currency funds for these types of
activities for both public and private enterprises in Brazil. FINEP is also the
designated administrator of the Fundo Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e



- 34 -
Tecnologico (FNDCT), the annually-funded principal instrument of the Brazilian
Government for increasing Brazilian enterprises' capacity for developing
and adapting technologies to Brazilian conditions; and, together with the
National Science Council, Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e
Tecnologia (CNPq) is also responsible for the planning of the Federal Govern-
ment's science and technology program. FINEP was established in July, 1967, by
SEPLAN, with assistance from the Inter American Development Bank (IDB). Over the
years, the IDB has provided FINEP with eight loans amounting to US$145.0 million
equivalent. Three of the loans (US$34.0 million equivalent) supported FINEP's
pre-investment activities; the remaining five (US$111.0 million equivalent) were
in support of FINEP's operations in foreign technology transfer to Brazil and
basic and adaptive research by Brazilian enterprises 1/. Under the Project, FINEP
will be primarily responsible for the non-alcohol-related technology development,
e.g., the research program to identify suitable biomass-based substitutes for
diesel oil, and technology for production of charcoal to substitute for fuel oil.
D. Environmental Safeguards
8.14      As discussed in para 6.08, the Government has established guidelines
for effluent treatment/utilization to be followed by all alcohol facilities;
these guidelines and the institutional arrangements for their enforcement are
considered satisfactory. The Government has agreed that these regulations and
the institutional arrangements for their enforcement will be maintained and that
the Bank will be advised of any significant change in the regulations and the
arrangements for their enforcement.
E. Reporting Requirements
8.15      Quarterly progress reports will be prepared by the principal
implementing institutions--CENAL, STI and FINEP. In addition, CENAL will
prepare in-depth annual reports on the entire Alcohol Program based on the
results of the annual monitoring activities . STI and FINEP will provide the
Bank with their proposed annual programs of technology development sub-projects
for approval; such approval to be conditioned on satisfactory prior year per-
formance.
F. Major Risks
8.16      Clearly, a project this complex, involving a major strategic initia-
tive to be implemented by a large number of institutions and with varying
sectoral objectives and constraints, has a number of risks associated with
it. By far, the biggest risk to the Project, and indeed the entire Alcohol
Program, is the balancing of the fuel demand profile, which by nature is
inflexible and intolerant of any but the most minimal variations in supply
against a supply profile dependent on raw materials which are subject to the
vagaries of nature (weather, disease, ecological conditions, etc.). The supply
risk would be especially pronounced in the 1981-85 period when 95% of the
alcohol supply is expected to come from one crop (sugarcane) while the demand,
as a proportion of automotive fuel, is increasing from 18.9% in 1980 to 45.1%
in 1985, with a parallel increase in the population of all-alcohol cars
which cannot use any other fuel but alcohol. Specific measures have been
designed to minimize this risk. CENAL requires all alcohol producers to
construct storage for three to five months of alcohol supplies and PETROBRAS
is establishing regional hydrous alcohol storage facilities of up to two
1/ FINEP financed the technology import component of the Bank-assisted Copesul
Petrochemical Project (Report No. 1842-BR, dated April 12, 1978).



- 35 -
months' demand (para 3.06). In the short-to-medium term, should this risk
occur, these storage facilities will provide Brazil with the necessary lead time
to adjust supply and demand patterns through (i) shifting of alcohol targeted
for chemical industry uses and reduction of alcohol for blending into gasoline
(these uses represent about two-thirds of total hydrous alcohol demand) for the
use of all-alcohol cars; and (ii) making arrangements to meet (import) any
resulting short-fall in gasoline supply. Over the long term, the efforts to
minimize dependence on one crop (sugarcane) is focused on speeding up the
incorporation of other known energy crops--cassava, wood, sweet sorghum and
babassu--into the raw material base. The Technology Development Component of
the Project will support these efforts, as will the proposed agricultural
research project (para 7.15).
8.17      To minimize (during the transition period) and eventually avoid
localized supply-demand imbalances, the Monitoring and Evaluation System
Component of the Project will provide CENAL with detailed information at the
state level and on regular basis, on energy consumption projections broken
down by type, alcohol transportation costs, alcohol production possibilities
based on the land zoning studies (para 7.12) and optimum location of new
alcohol distilleries. The information generated by the system will enable
CENAL, in consultation with the National Petroleum Council and PETROBRAS, to
balance regional alcohol supply and demand.
8.18      A more general risk relating to the Project concerns potential
competition between food, export and energy crops. While Brazil has vast
agricultural land resources and the land requirements of the Alcohol Program
are about 6% of the total crop land or about 3% of the existing crop and planted
pasture land, most of the land requirements for the Alcohol Program must be drawn
from among Brazil's better land resources. The land needs of the Project (and the
entire Alcohol Program), therefore, must be managed carefully to avoid/minimize
competition between food and energy crops. The measures currently being imple-
mented by the Government--(a) requirement that land for energy crops cannot
displace food and/or export crops unless substantial real advantages in pro-
ductivity can be demonstrated (para 6.04); (b) land zoning studies identifying
areas for energy crop production and which take into account the requirements of
other crops (para 7.12); (c) participation of the state authorities in land
use decisions vis-a-vis the Alcohol Program (para 7.12); and (d) strengthening
of the appraisal criteria unde the Project (paras 7.21 and 8.11)--are suitably
directed to minimizing competition between food and energy crops for land use,
and would need to be strictly enforced. All sub-projects to be financed out of
the loan proceeds will meet these requirements. Additionally, the Monitoring and
Evaluation Component of the Project will provide comprehensive analysis and
information on these and other variables on a continuing basis in the decision-
making on land use. The above arrangements are considered reasonable safeguards
in reducing the risk of competition for land use between energy and food/export
crops.
8.19      Given the multiplicity of institutions involved in the implementation
of the Project, there is always a risk of not achieving the desirable level of
coordination among and the active participation of the agencies involved.
CENAL's record to date in seeking the active participation of all the critical
agencies has been satisfactory. The structures of both CNAL and CENAL are
considered adequate to bring together the various objectives and constraints
in the sectors involved in the execution of the Alcohol Program. A major
catalyst to mTnimizing this risk is the everpresent national consciousness



- 36 -
that a shift away from fossil fuel to biomass-based fuel is a necessary
strategic initiative for Brazil in order to reduce the impact of increasing
prices of imported petroleum on the economy.
IX. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN

9.01      The total financing requirements of the Bank Project (i.e., the
1981-83 time slice of the Alcohol Program), including physical contingencies
and price escalation, working capital and interest during construction are
estimated at US$5.1 billion equivalent, or Cr$ 255.7 billion as shown in the

The base cost estimates are in 1980 prices and have been calculated on the basis
of assumptions described in paragraph 5.08.  The price escalation estimate is
based on international inflation rates, in US Dollar terms, of 9% in 1981, 8.5%
in 1982, 7.5% in 1983-85 and 6% thereafter. The working capital requirements,
which are all in local currency, were calculated on an incremental basis
(Project File, Exhibit J). Interest during construction (Project File, Exhibit
KT on foreign loans were calculated on (i) the proposed Bank loan of US$250.0
million for 15 years, including 3 years of grace period at 9.6% p.a. interest rate
plus a commitment fee of 0.75% p.a. on the undisbursed balance; and (ii) private
foreign borrowing of at least US$250.0 million the Government has indicated to the
Bank it plans to secure, in association with the proposed Bank loan, terms for
which have been assumed at 11% p.a. interest rate and 8 years repayment period,
including 3 years of grace.- Interest during construction on long-term local
currency funds have been excluded since these funds are provided by the Government
from tax revenues from alcohol consumers and road users (para 9.03) at no cost
to the Program.

9.03      The Project's long-term financing need is estimated at US$4,173.0
million equivalent, of which US$2,574.0 million (Cr$128.7 billion) is in local
currency. The local currency portion will be met by (i) equity contributions
from production sub-project sponsors totalling US$764.0 million equivalent or 18.3%
of the total long-term financing requirements; and (ii) consumer contributions of
about US$1,810.0 million equivalent (43.4% of total long-term financing) to be
provided by (a) the Energy Mobilization Fund, whose resources are generated
through road taxes on automobile owners and users (US$1,032 million or 24.7%),
and (b) net revenue accruing to the Government from alcohol sales, i.e., the
differential between the ex-distillery price of alcohol paid by the Government
and the pump price of anhydrous alcohol blended in gasohol and hydrous alcohol,
less distribution costs and dealers' margin (US$778 million or 18.7%).  The
equity contribution estimate is based on current Government policy which requires
production sub-project sponsors to provide 20% of the long-term financing



- 38 -
(excluding land) in equity funds, except in the case of farmers' cooperatives
or producers' association where the requirement is 10%. It is expected that
about 10% of the production sub-projects will be sponsored by farmers' coopera-
tives or producers' associations. Energy Mobilization Fund resources made
available to PROALCOOL in 1980 amounted to the equivalent of US$272.0 million;
annual contributions from this source is assumed not to exceed the 1980 equiva-
lent. As shown on page 2 of the Detailed Sources and Application of Funds
presented in Annex 9, the estimated net revenue accruing to the Government from
alcohol sales may far exceed the contributions from this source given the current
relationship between the ex-distillery price of alcohol and the pump price which
is expected to be maintained during the project implementation period 1/. The
foreign currency portion of the Project's long-term needs will be met by
(i) contributions from Government resources equivalent to US$1,099.0 million (26.3%
of long-term financing); (ii) the proposed Bank loan of US$250.0 million equiva-
lent (6%); and (iii) the foreign private borrowing of at least US$250.0
million (6%), which the Government proposes to secure in association with
the Bank loan. In addition, there will be a need for short-term loans of about
US$942.0 million equivalent for working capital requirements which will be met
by local banks. The Government has provided satisfactory assurances that it
will provide or cause to be provided, promptly as needed, all necessary funds
to complete the Project.
C. On-Lending Arrangements
9.04      The proposed Bank loan of US$250.0 million will be made to the Govern-
ment, at the standard Bank interest rate, for 15 years, including 3 years of
grace. The Borrower will pass on to Banco Central do Brasil US$220.0 million
equivalent of the proposed loan to finance a part of the 1981-83 alcohol producing
facilities, including demonstration units approved by CENAL. The remaining US$30.0
million will be passed on to FINEP (US$15.0 million equivalent), and STI (US$15.0
million equivalent), for financing of biomass energy technology research and
development. US$1.0 million of the funds channeled through Banco Central will be
used to finance CENAL's Monitoring and Evaluation System. The Government will bear
the foreign exchange risk on the proposed Bank loan.
9.05      The US$219.0 million equivalent for the Production Component and demon-
stration units will be used by Banco Central to refinance loans provided by
commercial and development banks to alcohol production sub-project sponsors on
PROALCOOL terms. PROALCOOL loan terms are reviewed at least once a year by the
Government. The terms for sub-projects to be approved in 1981, which were announced
by the Government in January 1981, are: (i) 90% financing for farmers' cooperatives
or producers' associations and 80% for all other sponsors; and (ii) 12-year repay-
ment period, including four years of grace for autonomous distilleries and three
years of grace for annex distilleries. The interest rates are set by the National
Monetary Council (CMN) taking into account the prevailing level of inflation in
the country and location of sub-project. PROALCOOL lending operations for 1981 are
operating under two interest rate regimes: (a) fixed interest rates, and (b) a
nominal interest rate of 5% p.a. plus monetary correction of the principal out-
standing linked to percentages of the annual variation of the Obrigacoes
Reajustaveis do Tesouro Nacional (ORTN), an index of Government bonds adjusted
regularly to reflect inflation. Details of the two regimes are shown below:
I/ See para 10.07 for anlaysis of the relationship.

PROALCOOL Interest Rates for Sub-Projects Approved in 1981

North,             Center-West, South,
Northeast Regions         Southeast Regions
Distillery Unit                         45% p.a.                  55% p.a.
Associated Agricultural Facility        35% p.a.                  45% p.a.
Weighted Average                        44% p.a.                  54% p.a.
(b)  5% p.a. Nominal Interest Rate plus Monetary Correction at
% of ORTN Variation
Annex Distillery                        60%                       70%
Autonomous Distillery                   55%                       65%
Sponsors whose sub-projects are approved in 1981 will be charged the lower of
the two. At the current inflation level of about 100%, interest rates on sub-
loans approved in 1981 will effectively be under the fixed regime. While these
interest rates are still negative, they amount to an effective increase of about
100% in the rates prevailing for PROALCOOL loans at the time of the Project's
appraisal in July, 1980   Interest rates for PROALC()OL at that time were monetary
correction at 40% of the annual variation in the ORTN plus nominal interest rate
averaging 4% p.a., resulting in an effective interest rate of about 27%. The
1981 PROALCOOL interest rates compare with the current effective interest rates
of 35% p.a. for long-term financing for production of manufactured exports, and
35% p.a. for agricultural production credits in the North/Northeast and'45% in
other regions. The Government has agreed to exchange views with the Bank from
time to time, and at least once a year, on the adequacy of the interest rates
applicable to PROALCOOL lending operations. The Government has further assured
the Bank that it is its policy to reduce, and gradually eliminate, interest rate
subsidies for lending operations under PROALCOOL pari passu with reduction and
elimination of interest rate subsidies for lending operations in other related
sectors such as agriculture and agro-industry.
9.06      The US$30.0 million to be passed on to FItEP and STI for the Technology
Development Component sub-projects will be re-lent to Brazilian enterprises
engaged in biomass energy technology development on terms consistent with
prevailing terms for technology development financing, which are: (i) loans
of up to 80% of the sub-project's financing requirements, 12-year repayment
period, including 3 years of grace, and 8% per annum interest rate with 40-100%
monetary correction; and (ii) grants which are primarily for basic R & D work.
Terms for each technology development sub-project in the Project will be deter-
mined by STI and FINEP on a case-by-case basis depending on risk factors,
value to the Brazilian economy and sub-project sponsoring organization.
D. Procurement
9.07      Procurement arrangements for the Production Component and demonstration
units of the Project are designed to permit international firms to compete on
a fair basis with local enterprises. The procedures for advertising and
prequalification will include: (i) advertisements published in the Development



- 40 -
Forum each year during the Project period; (ii) notification to embassies;
(iii) advertisements published in the local press and trade journals; (iv) a
60-day period for pre-registration by CENAL of foreign and local firms
on the basis of the criteria agreed with the Bank; and (v) periodic publication
of the pre-registered list in local press and trade journals. All subsequent
business development will be by individual suppliers and advertising for indi-
vidual sub-projects will not be required. Individual sub-projects to be
eligible for Bank funds will invite at least two local and two foreign suppliers
of their choice from above pre-registration list. Bidders will be allowed 45
days within which to submit their bids. The buyer will evaluate offers received
using his business judgement which would be largely based on price, but could
include operating efficiency, plant reliability, and after-sales service.
Foreign components in any offer will not be subject to customs duties in excess
of 15%. If the successful bidder is foreign, the Government, through its
appropriate agencies, will then freely and promptly issue any import license
necessary. Foreign component for this purpose will be defined as a separable
and readily identifiable item of a significant size and of a character that
would have led to separate procurement but for the need for single responsi-
bility for supply and erection of the alcohol production unit on a turnkey
basis. To facilitate its application, the borrower has indicated that it will
request bidders to break down their bids into eight components: (i) engineering
and supervision; (ii) civil works, including materials and erection; (iii) raw
material reception machinery, crushers, etc., up to juice preparation; (iv)
juice treatment and fermentation equipment; (v) electricals, steam generation,
utilities; (vi) distillation equipment; (vii) support facilities--laboratory,
maintenance shop, etc.; and (viii) effluent treatment and miscellaneous equipment.
The arrangements, which will open the Alcohol Program to foreign suppliers for the
first time and which have been agreed to by the Government, represent a major
modification of the current Brazilian procurement procedures, which reserve all
alcohol facility supply to local firms.
9.08      The proposed approach takes into consideration that (a) the alcohol
plant owner is a profit-oriented private investor, who is strongly motivated
to purchase the plants under the most attractive (normally least cost) tech-
nical and commercial terms; (b) local suppliers are expected to mount a major
marketing effort to obtain business particularly considering the current sub-
stantial underutilization of industrial plant capacity; and (c) procurement
would be readily open to any qualified non-Brazilian supplier who can demonstrate
to a local investor that the supplier's total package, including capital costs,
alcohol production costs and commercial and technical risks, is superior to that
offered by local suppliers. Procurement decisions for the Production Component
will be carefully monitored during project implementation to ensure that project
approval, procurement and disbursement procedures of CENAL and Banco Central are
consistent with the agreed procedures.
9.09      Technology Development Component sub-projects below US$1.0 million
will be procured in accordance with sound commercial and technical considerations
acceptable to the Bank. Sub-projects above US$1.0 million, which will be
subject to prior Bank approval (para 8.13), will be procured under limited
international tendering or prudent commercial practice to the satisfaction of
the Bank as dictated by the kinds of goods and services to be obtained.



- 41 
It is anticipated that the bulk of the procurement for the Technology Develop-
ment sub-projects will be on the basis of prudent commercial practice; about 5-10
out of the 50-60 sub-projects expected for this component are likely to exceed
US$1.0 million. Procurement for consultant services for the Monitoring and
Evaluation System Component will be by negotiation with independent consulting
organizations to be selected by CENAL whose qualifications and conditions of
employment will be satisfactory to the Bank.
E.   Disbursements

Bank funds will be disbursed to cover 55% of the installed cost or 100% of
foreign expenditures for each production sub-project, whichever shall be
higher, and 50% of the total cost of each technology sub-project. Disburse-
ments in respect of local currency expenditures for production unit sub-pro-
jects and FINEP technology sub-projects will be made against Statements of
Expenditures certified by Banco Central and FINEP, respectively. The State-
ments of Expenditures will be broken down by sub-project and will discriminate
amounts disbursed during reporting period, total amount disbursed to date, and
amount claimed for reimbursement. The Statements of Expenditures will be
accompanied by a form letter submitted by the financial agent to Banco Central
or FINEP, certifying all expenditures. Detailed documentation supporting the
Statements of Expenditures will be maintained by Banco Central and FINEP and
be made available for review by Bank supervision missions. The Bank will
disburse, against complete documentation, 100% of total costs of consultants
employed by CENAL in respect of the Monitoring and Evaluation System. Dis-
bursements in respect of foreign expenditures and STI technology sub-projects
will be fully documented.
F.   Accounts and Audits
9.12      Not later than six months after the close of each fiscal year, the
Bank will be provided with the results of an audit of the Statements of Ex-
penditures carried out by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The
auditors' reports should express an opinion as to the reliability of the
Statements of Expenditures supporting claims for disbursements (i.e., whether
claims are supported by adequate documentation and reflect properly incurred
expenditures for legitimate Project purposes) and the adequacy of Banco
Central's, FINEP's and STI's internal controls regarding Project funds as
well as those of CENAL with respect to funds for consultant services.
Assurances to this effect have been obtained from the Government. In addi-
tion, it is agreed that Banco Central will cause the accounts of financial
agents whose PROALCOOL loans are reimbursed from the proceeds of the Bank
loan to have their accounts audited, in accordance with appropriate
auditing principles, by independent auditors acceptable to Banco Central
and the Bank. The report of such audit will include opinions expressed by
the auditors on expenditures and procedures relating to the sub-projects
financed by the Bank and the reliability of Statements of Expenditures to
Banco Central requesting reimbursement for such expenditures. Such audits
will be made available to Banco Central no later than five months after the
close of the fiscal year of the financial agent, and be subject to review
by the Bank.
X.  FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. General Approach
10.01     The Alcohol Program is being implemented by private investors
in a high inflation environment and under a package of Government poli-
cies which sets limits on the loan amounts available for alcohol investments,
determine the terms of these loans and control sugarcane input and alcohol
output prices. The four major financial issues identified as being cTitical
in this area are: (i) the ability of the PROALCOOL loans and terms to continue
to attract private investors to the Alcohol Program; (ii) Government alcohol
pricing policy; (iii) the fiscal impact of the Project on Government budget;



- 43 -
and (iv) whether the Government is subsidizing the alcohol consumer. The
focus of this chapter is on the first three issues; the issue of whether the
alcohol consumer is being subsidized by the Government is discussed in the
next chapter.
B. Rate of Return on Equity
10.02     New PROALCOOL loan terms and interest rates introduced in January 1981
are discussed in para 9.05. The key indicator to measure the continued attractive-
ness of investment in alcohol projects to the private investor is the return on
equity using PROALCOOL loan facility under current terms compared to terms
existing prior to January 1981. The base case for the comparison of return on
owner's equity is the "standard" 120,000 lpd autonomous sugarcane-based facility,
assumed to be located in the Southeast region. The key assumptions used in the
analysis, including capital costs for the industrial and agricultural components
and operating costs, are presented in Annex 10-1. A 20-year operating life for
the distillery, which is consistent with Brazilian experience, has been assumed.
Inflation is assumed to decline from 100% in 1981 to 75% in 1982, 60% in 1983,
50% in 1984, and to stabilize at 40% in 1985 and thereafter, consistent with
current expectations. It is assumed that the sugarcane and ex-distillery alco-
hol prices will be adjusted twice yearly in line with inflation.
10.03     The detailed financial analysis for an autonomous 120,000 lpd
distillery in the Southeast under PROALCOOL loan terms prevailing before
January 1981, is given in Annex 10-2. The analysis based on the
existing terms is given in Annex 10-3. The results are presented below:
Investor Return on Equity for Sugarcane-Based Alcohol Sub-Project
(7 return in constant terms)

Annual Adjustment of Prices a/                10                       18
a/ Assuming the price increase is equivalent to the inflationary cost
increases during the intervening period.
10.04     The return on equity is a function of (i) financial leverage; (ii) in-
terest rates; (iii) assumed inflation; (iv) frequency of adjustments on sugar-
cane/ alcohol prices; and (v) a number of project related factors affecting each
individual investor differently (e.g., efficiency in project implementation and
operation including agricultural operations, percentage of cane purchased and tax
considerations). Thus, the returns in the above table apply to a common set of
assumptions for the "typical" base case, before taxes though in practice, indrivdual



- 44 -
investor return could vary significantly;  also the above returns are for ideal
performance of the project and the actual returns obtained by the investors
could be lower due to business risks (e.g., implementation delays, adverse
weather). The return on equity to the alcohol investor under the current
PROALCOOL terms in a high inflation scenario, even with the Government adjusting
ex-distillery alcohol prices twice a year in line with inflation (a practice
which the Government had followed since the inception of PROALCOOL except in
1980) is substantially less than under the previous financing terms.
10.05     The principal reason for the lower return on owner's equity under
the current interest rates is the sharp upward adjustment (almost 100%) of the
interest on PROALCOOL loans paid by the alcohol investor (para 9.05) without a
corresponding adjustment in real terms of the ex-distillery price of alcohol
paid by the Government to the investor. Assuming all other factors being
the same, since the Government controls both the input and output prices, these
recent changes in PROALCOOL interest rates need to be accompanied by corres-
ponding changes in real terms in the ex-distillery price of alcohol in order
to maintain the attractiveness of the Alcohol Program at the level that has come
to be expected by private investors. The table below presents the results of
an analysis of the real increase in the ex-distillery price of alcohol required
to maintain the owner's return on equity at the estimated "typical" level
prevailing prior to January 1981.

Post-Jan. 1981          54%                 14                 2.0            16.75
C.  Government Pricing Policy
10.06.    Of equal significance to the alcohol investor is the frequency of
alcohol/cane price adjustments considering the current high inflation rate
and that the investor keeps up to 6 months alcohol inventory. As shown in
the sensitivity analysis in para 10.03, if alcohol prices are fixed in current
terms for one year, the return on investor's equity under current PROALCOOL
interest rates drops from about 14% to about 10%. If, on the other hand, the
Government were to adjust prices on a quarterly basis, the return on owner's
equity increases by two percentage points to 16%.   To bring the return on
owner's equity to the same level as in the pre-January 1981 base case while
adjusting ex-distillery alcohol prices on a quarterly basis would need only
Cr$1.45/liter real increase compared to the Cr$2.0/liter estimated in para 10.05
above on the basis of twice-yearly price adjustments. The required increase
in real terms will not represent a subsidy to the alcohol investor, since, as
shown in para 10.07, the ex-distillery price of alcohol is well belowr the re-
tail price, and Government pricing policy results in substantial net revenues



- 45 -
to the budget. The Government has agreed to establish a pricing policy that
will maintain the ex-factory price of alcohol at levels that will enable spon-
sors of production sub-projects operating efficiently, to generate funds
sufficient to service their debt, cover all their other costs and earn a reason-
able return on their equity; such prices to be adjusted periodically to reflect
changes in the valuation of the sponsors' assets and production costs, and in
interest rates on loans under PROALCOOL. For this purpose, a reasonable return
is considered to be approximately 20% return before taxes determined on a dis-
counted cash flow basis; and periodic adjustment is understood to be at least
twice a year.
D. Fiscal Impact on Government Budget
10.07     As indicated, the Government controls alcohol prices, both ex-distillery
and retail. At June 30, 1980, the ex-distillery price of alcohol was Cr$14.75/liter,
while the retail price of anhydrous alcohol blended into gasoline was Cr$34.50;
retail hydrous alcohol price is established at 65% of the pump price of gasohol. As
shown below, for each liter of anhydrous alcohol in gasoline sold to the consumer at
the pump, the Government received a net revenue of Cr$15.21, and for straight or
hydrous alcohol Cr$3.11/liter:

alcohol price and retail price to the consumers, is assumed to stay at present
levels in constant terms. In the first four years of the Project, the disburse-
ment of PROALCOOL loans constitutes a sizeable budgetary outflow, reaching
about US$760 million equivalent in 1983. By the fifth year, the loans are fully
disbursed and start being repaid, and receipts from the net Government revenue
from alcohol sales to budgetary resources due to these financial inflows from the
Project, average about US$350 million equivalent per annum. Over the 20-year
useful life of the Project, the present value of the net cash flows to the
Government due to the Project, estimated at 11% opportunity cost of capital, is
about US$960 million equivalent. The above analysis illustrates that the Alcohol
Program results in a substantial net positive contribution to the Government
budget.
1/ This analysis is on an incremental basis, i.e., Government revenues from
alcohol sales in gasohol, which are attributed to investments prior to
1981, are not considered.

XI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Key Assumptions
11.01     The economic viability of alcohol production from biomass has
been analyzed on the basis of standardized plants. For sugarcane-based facili-
ties, which would provide about 95% of total alcohol production in 1985, the
analysis is based on "autonomous" plants of an average size of 120,000 lpd
capacity in the three regions of the country which will account for most of
the cane production under the Alcohol Program: (i) Southeast; (ii) Northeast;
and (iii) South. For cassava-based facilities which would be providing 5% of
the 1985 alcohol target, the economic analysis is also based on 120,000 lpd
plants. Input/output prices have been based on average economic costs applicable
for the three regions. Since also in practice most new distilleries are being
built with 120,000 1/day capacity, the economic return for one standard project
is a reasonable approximation of the benefits of the overall program. "Annexed"
distilleries would have a substantially higher return but there are limited
opportunities to build them in the future.
11.02     The economic viability of ethanol production is critically dependent
on the economic values attributed to raw materials and to the alcohol product.
Sugarcane has been valued at its average economic cost of production, cassava
at its selling price, and alcohol at its opportunity value (gasoline equivalent).
11.03     Since sugarcane to be used for alcohol production can also be
processed into sugar which is an internationally traded commodity, it can be
a priori argued that cane opportunity value is related to that of sugar
exports, and that sugarcane economic value should be linked to world sugar
prices. For Brazil, however, the economic value of the additional sugarcane
grown for alcohol production cannot be directly linked to sugar export prices,
because it will be grown on additional land and if diverted to sugar exports
on a permanent basis would seriously disrupt world markets. The additional
production of sugarcane requirements to meet the 1985 alcohol production
target represents about 110 million tpy of sugarcane, and would correspond to
an incremental production of 11 million tons of sugar (40% of present world
sugar trade). To dispose of this sugar surplus, Brazil would have to in-
crease its share of world sugar trade from its current 9% to about 45% by
.1985. Additional exports of this magnitude, even if it were allowed under the
International Sugar Agreement export quotas (which is unlikely), would seriously
disrupt the world sugar market, and its primary effect likely to be a sharp
reduction in world sugar prices. Although some of the high cost producers such
as the Ivory Coast and South Africa could be driven out of the market, many of
the major exporting producers can be expected to continue to stay in the market.
The European Economic Community which now has about 14% of the world market
and guarantees its exporters a minimum return regardless of world prices is
unlikely to cut back production significantly; and many of the remaining major
exporters are either mono-crop economies (Cuba, Dominican Republic, other
Central American countries and Mauritius) or depend on sugar exports so
significantly (Jamaica, Thailand and the Philippines) that they would not
readily have the option of cutting back on their production in such an eventu-
ality; past experience confirms this tendency. The Bank's sugar commodity
model indicates that the world 1985 sugar prices would decrease by about 50%
from their projected long-term equilibrium level were Brazil to export this
additional sugar quantity. On the basis of this analysis, the economic value of
the additional cane grown for the Alcohol Program has been estimated to equal
the full economic cost of production, including land rent, land preparation,



- 47 -
agricultural equipment, and planting and harvesting costs. The above valua-
tion approach results in a higher economic value of sugarcane used for alcohol
production than the economic value of sugarcane were Brazil to divert the
additional sugar production for export.
11.04     Ethanol can be used as automobile fuel either as "gasohol" in which
case anhydrous ethanol (99.8%) is mixed with gasoline up to 20% ratio, or as
hydrous or straight alcohol, in which case 94% ethanol (6% water) is used
alone. The economic value of alcohol as gasoline substitute is different in
these two applications   Existing internal combustion automobile engines do
not require any modifications to run on "gasohol". Cars obtain substantially
the same mileage performance whether they are run OTI gasohol or on regular
gasoline. Different factors including octane rating, fuel value, thermal
efficiency, individually affect mileage performance but, in total, do not
significantly modify performance. Thus, the opportunity value of anhydrous
ethanol is assumed to be equivalent to the economic cost of gasoline in
"gasohol". The economic value of straight ethanol is estimated at 86% of
anhydrous ethanol after adjusting for (i) increase in car production costs
(about 5%); (ii) loss of fuel efficiency as indicated by lower mileage (about
20%); (iii) increased volume of ethanol production by volume (6%) from the same
raw materials; and (iv) savings in straight (94%) ethanol production costs
(about 5%) as described in Annex 11-1.   The economic value of gasoline in
Brazil is estimated at US$0.274/liter in mid-1980 terms (based on an average
crude oil price of US$31.2 per barrel fob Middle East). Gasoline and crude oil
values are assumed to increase at 3.0% p.a. in real terms over the next 20
years.
B. Economic Capital and Operating Costs
11.05     The Brazilian alcohol industry, which has built some 250 distilleries,
has developed into an efficient competitive supplier of conventional sugarcane
alcohol technology. Available data suggest that the Brazilian industry is
competitive with international suppliers. Economic capital costs in mid-1980
prices (excluding taxes, price escalation, working capital, and interest
during construction) for a 120,000 lpd sugarcane-based alcohol sub-project
located in the Southeast and the South of Brazil are estimated at US$10.8
million equivalent (Annex 11-2). Transport and other location factors (such
as higher construction costs) add approximately 10% to these costs for a
distillery located in the Northeast. These costs ares for autonomous distil-
leries built on turnkey lump-sum contracts and include facilities for cane
reception, crushing, fermentation, distillation, storage, steam and power gener-
ation from bagasse, and all other in-plant and transport facilities. Cassava
or other starch-based alcohol plants are technically similar to sugarcane-
based plants, except for additional equipment for the saccharification of starch
into sugar. It is estimated that cassava-based alcohol plants would cost 20%
more than similar sugarcane-based plants.
11.06     Brazilian equipment manufacturers quote a normal supply-cum-erection
time of 10-14 months for a distillery. However, for the economic analysis
included in this report, a more conservative assumption of 18 months in the
Southeast and South and 24 months in the Northeast has been taken. The distil-
leries are assumed to operate at 60% capacity in the third year after project
initiation (i.e., first year of operation), 90% in the fourth year and 100%
thereafter. Distilleries are relatively simple chemical plants which normally
operate at 100% capacity during the 6-month cane cropping season. Maintenance



- 48 -
is carried out during the off-season. The economic life of the plants has
been assumed at 20 years.
11.07     Economic production costs are shown in Annex 11-2.  The principal
costs in producing alcohol are fuel and feedstock. A sugarcane distillery is
energy self-sufficient (it uses bagasse from sugarcane to fuel its boilers
and generate power) and other variable production costs are not as significant
as in other chemical plants. The opportunity value for bagasse has been
assumed to be zero since there is no alternative economic use for bagasse
in most distilleries. For a standard-sized distillery, yearly economic
variable costs amount to about US$0.015/liter and fixed costs to US$0.023/liter.
It is assumed that stillage is recycled back to nearby agricultural fields as
fertilizer and that no by-product credit or debit is given to stillage. For
cassava plants which have to purchase outside energy, operating costs are more
significant, and excluding cassava cost, are estimated to average US$0.18/liter
if fuel oil is used (75% is attributable to fuel). If coal or wood were to be
used, outside energy costs would substantially be reduced, which would improve
the economics of cassava-based plants.
11.08     The two major components of the working capital for an alcohol
plant are finished product inventory and accounts receivable. Sugarcane
distilleries operate between 165 and 200 days per year, whereas alcohol
off-take is spread evenly throughout the year. Finished product is stored
for deliveries in the off-season, and on a yearly basis, averages about 90
days of production. Cassava plants operate for an estimated 300 days per year
with an average product inventory of about 30 days of production. Accounts
receivable are assumed to average 45 days of sales. Sugarcane and other material
inventories are very small and are assumed to be offset by accounts payable.
11.09     Sugarcane.  Agricultural production costs are calculated separately
for the different regions: (i) the Southeast, which is a rich agricultural
region with intensively farmed and highly mechanized large plantations; (ii) the
Northeast where cane production is less mechanized and more labor intensive
than in the Southeast and land value, labor productivity and cane yields are
lower than in the Southeast; and (iii) the South where the yields are compara-
ble to those of the Southeast. The average cropping season in Northeast (200
days per year) is, however, longer than in both the Southeast (180 days) and
the South (165 days). Labor is in oversupply in the Northeast and its economic
cost is lower than in the Southeast and South. Large plantations are not as
common in the South as in the Southeast region and the typical distillery is
likely to obtain its cane supply from dispersed small cane producers.
11.10     The economic sugarcane production costs were estimated on the basis
of detailed data on current yields, labor and agricultural input costs and the
cost of production per ha prepared by a number of Government and private sector
institutes on the basis of actual farm surveys in all major producing areas.
The financial costs were adjusted for distortions in fertilizer prices, land
rental value and for the depreciation charges on machinery to derive the eco-
nomic cost of production. Labor in the Northeast has been shadow-priced at
0.7 of its market rate, but for the other parts of the country, no shadow
pricing of labor has been used. It has been assumed that most new planta-
tions would be on clear land, primarily unimproved pasture land, and would
not require extensive deforestation, with about six months needed for land
preparation before the first planting. Fertilizer and pesticide costs were
assumed to increase at 1.5% and 1% p.a.in real terms, respectively. Land
rental value is assumed to increase at 1% p.a. in real terms in the base case,



- 49 -
with sensitivity test for 5% p.a. increase throughout the sub-project's life.
Annual economic agricultural costs for a 120,000 lpd sugarcane distillery in
the three regions estimated on the basis of these assumptions, are summarized
below:

11L.11    Cassava:  Cassava is primarily a subsistence crop, with retail
prices in June 1980 in the range of Cr$ 1,625-1,950/ton, equivalent to about
US$25.0-30.0/ton at 30% shadow-pricing of the Cr$. As detailed in Annex 7-2,
considerable research work to improve the cultural practices and yields of the
crop is being carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture's research unit
(EMBRAPA), the results of which are expected to be ready for transfer into
commercial production in two-three years. The future economic production cost
for cassava using improved cultural practices and cultivars of higher yields,
particularly in a well-organized system developed specifically for alcohol
production, would very likely be well below the current retail market prices.
Due to uncertainties involved in projecting the likely reduction in the economic
production cost by the results of EMBRAPA's research efforts, the economic price
of cassava in this analysis is assumed to be at the low end of the present
market price, i.e., US$25.0/ton as the base case with sensitivity tests for
prices ranging from US$20.0/ton to US$30.0/ton. It: has been assumed further
that since cassava is a starch crop which in poor regions may be substituted for
food crops such as wheat and corn, its price woulcl increase in real terms at 1%
p.a., in line with the Bank's estimates for increases in real price of these
food crops.
D.  Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
1. Alcohol Production from Sugarcane
11.12     Based on the above assumptions, alcohol production from sugarcane is
economically viable in all three major sugarcane growing regions of Brazil. The
economic rate of return for anhydrous production from sugarcane for gasohol in a
standard 120,000 l/d plant is calculated between 22-26% and for hydrous alcohol
production between 17-21%. Since the Brazilian market for "gasohol" is vir-
tually saturated in 1980 any future analysis should be based on hydrous alcohol
production. The results of the economic return calcuIations for a typical
sugarcane-based distillery together with sensitivity tests are summarized in
the table below; the detailed analysis is presented in Annex 11-3.

Capacity 20,000 lpd                   13.0          10.7          13.2
The economic viability of alcohol production from sugarcane varies only
marginally with location, largely due to offsetting factors. The Southeast
is the most efficient producer. The Northeast shows a slightly lower return,
largely because of longer cropping seasons, lower land costs and shadow
pricing of agriculture labor compensate for lower productivity. The economic
return is slightly higher in the South, largely because agricultural produc-
tivity is equivalent to the Southeast but costs are lower. The economic
return is not very sensitive to land value but a 20% decrease in agricultural
yield lowers the return by 2-3 percentage points.
2.   Alcohol Production from Cassava
11.13     The economics of cassava-based ethanol plants are less attractive
compared to sugarcane, due to higher capital cost (para 11.05) and the need to
purchase (or develop) outside energy sources (para 11.07). To compensate,
cassava-based plants must obtain their raw materials and energy at a relatively
low cost. The economic rate of return calculations for cassava-based ethanol
plants are summarized below, the detailed analysis is shown in Annex 11-4:

11.14     Even after assuming that cassava units would be more energy effi-
cient without a significant capital cost penalty compared to sugar-based units,
cassava units that produce hydrous ethanol would be economic at the mid-1980 oil
prices only if cassava is US$25/ton or lower and if the energy cost of these



- 51 -
plants can be cut in half for the same capital costs, which could be achieved
with efficient tree plantations or with low-cost coal. It should be possible
to reduce cassava production cost to below current levels once the results of
EMBRAPA's research work have been translated into commercial practice.
E. Is the Government Subsidizing the Alcohol Consumer?
11.15     The issue of whether the Brazilian alcohol consumer, primarily the
automobile driver, is paying the full economic cost of alcohol production has
been discussed extensively. As the following analysis shows, the automobile
user in Brazil is paying more than the full economic cost:

(para 10.07) shadow-priced by 30%.
b/  See Annex 11-3; cost/liter in first full year of production.
cl  Anhydrous alcohol requires extra steam and benzene to bring it
to the required concentration (para 4.04). The cost/liter of
the extra steam and benzene is estimated at US$0.014.
Brazilian Government policy in recent years has been to pass on all increases in
gasoline cost immediately to the consumer. As retail alcohol prices are tied to
gasoline prices, it is expected that the Brazilian alcohol consumer will con-
tinue to pay more than the full economic cost of alcohol. Assurances have been
obtained from the Government that it will maintain an alcohol pricing policy
that will establish retail alcohol prices to the consumer at levels not below
the full economic production cost.
F.   Project Benefits
11.16      Since the alcohol facilities in the Project are expected to be based
on the same standard technologies (Chapter IV) and since the predominant capa-
city being erected is 120,000 lpd (paras 8.03 and 11.01), the economic rates
of return calculated in the Chapter for the standard sub-projects are con-
sidered reasonable approximations of the rates of return on the Production
Component of the Project. On this basis, 95% (in volume of alcohol production



- 52 -
from the 244 sugarcane-based facilities) of the component is expected to yield
an estimated economic rate of return of between 17-21% while the remaining
9 cassava-based units combined would have an estimated 10-16% rate of return
using wood or coal as distillery fuel source with the economic cost of cassava
between US$20-25/ton. On the basis of gasoline prices based on mid-1980 crude
oil values and on the assumption of 3.0% p.a. increase in gasoline and petro-
leum prices in real terms (para 11.04), the output of the Production Component
will save Brazil, on the average, an estimated US$1.3 billion per annum net of
the foreign exchange production costs (fertilizer, insecticides, lubricants,
etc., used in the agricultural production) and servicing of the Project's foreign
exchange debt. Over the 20-year economic life of the Production Component, the
total net foreign exchange savings is estimated at about US$32 billion in
mid-1980 prices.
11.17     In addition to the above benefits, the Production Component will
generate employment both in the agricultural and industrial/services sectors.
Net incremental employment in agriculture cannot be estimated accurately until
proposals for the siting of the new distilleries are known. Where the new sugar-
cane areas are mechanized and in areas where they might eventually compete with
foodcrops and agricultural small enterprises on flat lands, the net agricultural
employment impact would be neutral or negative. If, on the contrary, they are
non-mechanized and are established on pastureland, job creation may be substan-
tial. Due to the nature of the Project, data available at this time does not
permit judging yet what mix of land sources is likely for the agricultural
facilities included in the Project. In the industrial sector, some 57,000 direct
permanent jobs are expected to be created in the operation of the 253 distil-
leries in the Project; an estimated 130,000 indirect jobs are also expected to be
created through (i) production of agricultural and distillery equipment to meet
the Project's requirements, (ii) conversion of some 500,000 cars to operate on
hydrous alcohol; and (iii) production of new automobile parts unique to all-
alcohol cars (e.g., tin-plated fuel tank, fuel pre-heating system) by automobile
industry suppliers. In addition, the Technology Development Component is ex-
pected to create net professional jobs of about 1,500 while another 2,000-3,000
jobs would be created in other services related to the Project (e.g., distribu-
tion, regulation enforcement, quality control, banking services).
11.18     The Project will also generate substantial non-quantifiable benefits.
Brazil's equipment manufacturing industry is currently underutilized. The
industry, which is quite competitive, is expected to supply substantial
portions of the Project's equipment requirements (alcohol distilleries,
agricultural equipment, alcohol storage tanks, etc.) thus increasing its
capacity utilization. The Technology Development Component of the Project will
help put Brazil in the forefront of biomass renewable energy technology, thus
enhancing Brazil's opportunities for exporting its knowhow in this area to
other countries. Finally, the Monitoring and Evaluation System will provide
Brazil with an effective tool for planning the future development of the
Alcohol Program by taking into consideration its impact on the agriculture and
energy sectors.
XII. AGREEMENTS
12.01     The following major agreements and assurances have been obtained from
the Government, Banco Central, CENAL, STI and FINEP:



- 53 -
A.   From the Government that it will
(a)  ensure that under the Project, (i) alcohol projects will not be
located in traditional sugarcane growing areas except when sponsored
by small-farmer cooperatives; and (ii) should the Bank determine that
a production sub-project under would have, or is having a material
and adverse impact on employment, land ownership by small farmers
or rights of tenant farmers to land, food crop production or the
environment, Bank financing would be suspended (para 7.21);
(b)  cause CENAL to design and implement a Monitoring and
Evaluation System for the National Alcohol Program (PROALCOOL),
furnish copies of the system's reports to and periodically discuss
the findings with the Bank (paras 8.09 and 8.10);
(c)  (i) cause its agencies to appraise Project sub-projects in accordance
with agreed appraisal criteria and in accordance with relevant
Brazilian legislation; (ii) introduce economic evaluation in the
appraisal criteria for production sub-projects by December 31, 1981;
and (iii) inform the Bank of any significant changes in the criteria
and exchange views with the Bank at least once a year on their adequacy
(paras 6.08 and 8.11);
(d)  ensure that sub-projects included in the Project conform to satis-
factory environmental standards and regulations and that the institu-
tional arrangements for their enforcement will be maintained and

BRAZIL - ALCOHOL AND BIOMASS ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN THE REPORT
Anhydrous:                 Dry, without any contained water in physical or
chemical combination. However, anhydrous ethanol
(also called absolute alcohol) usually contains up
to 0.7% water in physical combination.
Hydrous:                    Contains water in physical or chemical combination.
Hydrous ethanol (also called rectified spirit) contains
usually about 6% water.
Ethanol:                   Ethyl alcohol, or alcohol in common parlance.  Produced
by fermentation of simpler ;sugars (glucose and cane
sugar); it can also be produced by conversion of
carbohydrates (starch) or cellulose materials into
simpler sugars followed by fermentation. Fermentation
in this context is the process in which a particular
strain of yeast is introduced into the glucose base
to convert it into ethanol. Ethanol can also be pro-
duced synthetically from certain chemical feedstocks.
Saccharification:          The process whereby certain carbohydrates and complex
sugar molecules (e.g., cellulose) are broken down to
simpler sugar (glucose) molecules.
Denaturant:                Additive to prevent or discourage use of product other
than intended. Methanol or fusel oil, for example, are
used to denature ethanol to make it unfit for human
consumption by imparting a disagreeable odor to the
ethanol.
Fusel Oil:                 Heavy, acrid,oily residue left after final separation
of ethanol from water.
Stillage:                  Residue left after initial concentration of alcohol
from fermented mash.  Contains water, fibrous and mineral
matter.
Combustion Efficiency:    Measure of the extent of thermal energy (contained in
the fuel) converted into useful heat or work. In
internal combustion engines, efficiency depends on the
extent of conversion of fuel to work as affected by
the temperature, pressure, and amount of oxygen present
in the engine cylinder.
Hydrogenation:              The process of treatment with hydrogen for removal of
undesirable impurities such as sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen
compounds or for saturating certain reactive molecules
in the product for better stability.

DETAILED CAPITAL COST ESTIMATES OF
PRODUCING UNITS
1.         The detailed capital cost estimates of the producing units are based
on 120,000 liters/day autonomous facility. The capital cost estimates exclude the
cost of land, consistent with PROALCOOL requirements.
I. Detailed Installed Cost Estimate - 120,000 liters/day Sugarcane-Based Facility
2.         Distillery Unit.  The installed cost of a 120,000 liters/day sugarcane-
based distillery unit, including physical contingency but excluding interest during
construction, is estimated at US$9.48 million equivaLent (Cr$474 million) in
mid-1980 prices. Distillery units in Brazil are supplied on a lumpsum-turnkey basis
and the estimate is based on this assumption; however, a 5% physical contingency
has been added for possible variation in costs for p:Lants located in relatively
remote areas. The detailed cost estimates are presented below. They are based
on a review of a sample of recent alcohol project proposals submitted to CENAL
for approval,and extensive discussions with Brazilian engineering firms and equip-
ment manufacturers involved in alcohol systems supply. The estimates were also
checked against the June-July CENAL investment matrix used for project approvals
and other data available to the Bank.

3.        The Brazilian alcohol equipment manufacturing industry which has built
over 250 distilleries, most of them since PROALCOOL, has been expanding its
capacity in anticipation of the increased investments in the Alcohol Program.
It is expected that most,if not all,of the distilleries included in the 1981-85
program will therefore be manufactured in Brazil. The estimated foreign exchange
component (38% of total installed cost) has been based on the imported materials con-
tained in the installed distillery unit. The percentage of foreign component and the
significant imported items in each of the categories are summarized below:

4.        Sugarcane Agricultural Facility.  The capital cost for the associated
agricultural facility for a 120,000 liters/day distillery is based on the average
yield per hectare and an average of 70 liters of alcohol per ton of sugarcane.
Due to differences in labor and soil productivity and harvesting regimes in the
different agricultural regions of Brazil, the average land area required to support
a 120,000 liters per day, based on current yields, varies between 5,657 ha in the
South to 8,571 ha in the Northeast, as shown below:

Although the land area requirement varies from region to region, based on dis-
cussions with the Sugar and Alcohol Institute (IAA) and CENAL, it was established
that the variations in the total capital investment, excluding land, are marginal.
A sample of recent project proposals submitted to CENAL for approval confirmed
this. For estimating the investment cost of the 1981-85 program, an average of
6,100 ha per 120,000 liters/day distillery has been assumed, with a 10% physical
contingency to cover possible variations. The total capital cost, including
physical contingency but excluding the cost of land, is estimated at US$3.2 million
(Cr$158.0 million) in mid-1980 prices. The estimate is consistent with the
estimates of COPERSUCAR, the largest sugar cooperative in Brazil, and that of
Instituto do Economica Agricola (IEA), an organization specializing in agricultural
production costs. The detailed estimates are presented below:

The foreign exchange cost represents 32% of total cost and consists of indirect
imported items. The estimate is consistent with estimates of components with
comparable features in rural development, projects in Brazil. The percentage of
foreign component and the significant imported items in each category are
summarized below:

II. Detailed Installed Cost Estimate - 120,000 litersJday Cassava-Based Facility
5.        Distillery Unit.  Considerably less informatjion is available on cassava-
based distilleryunits than for sugarcane-basedunits because of the relative newness
of the technology in the Alcohol Program. Eleven cassava-based alcohol producing
facilities have been approved by CENAL as of June 1980. All are still in implemen-
tation. Like the sugarcane-based unit, cassava-based distilleries in Brazil are
also offered on lumpsum-turnkey basis. Capital cost data are based on discussions
with equipment manufacturers, owners of cassava-based facilities in implementation
and review of CENAL's June-July, 1980 investment cost matrix used for proposal
approval. The mid-1980 base cost of a 120,000 liters/day cassava distillery is
estimated at US$10.84 million (about Cr$542 million), about 20% more than for a
sugarcane-based facility of similar capacity. The 20% base cost differential is
due to additional front-end equipment needed in cassava distilleries to accommodate
the washing, peeling and liquefying of the starch to break it down to fermentable
sugars before entering the point where sugarcane-based plants begin. The percentage
of indirect foreign exchange cost is assumed to be the same (38%) as for a sugarcane-
based distillery. Physical contingency is estimated at 10% in view of the process
technology's relative newness in Brazil.

6.        Cassava Agricultural Facility.  The estimated investment cost of the
agricultural facility, excluding land, is based on mission estimates of US$75.0/ha
and the current average alcohol yield of 2,400 liters per hectare. Based on
experience with the agricultural system and the expected plant and raw material
organization, owners of facilities currently in implementation expect to operate
the distillery 330 days a year. For this analysis, 300 operating days/year or
36 million liters per 120,000 liters/day plant has been assumed. The total land
requirement on this basis is estimated at 15,000 ha per 120,000 1/day distillery.
A 10% physical contingency has been assumed to take account of possible variations in
cost. The foreign exchange component is on the same basis as for a sugarcane
plantation for a similar capacity distillery (32%).

BRAZIL - ALCOHOL AND BIOMASS ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ALTERNATIVE ENERGY CROPS
1.        Cassava is indigenous to Brazil, and Brazil today is the world's
largest producer of fresh cassava roots. Official government statistics,
which must be interpreted with great caution for this largely subsistence
crop, indicate production in 1978 of about 25 million tons on just over two
million ha. About one-half of this total is produced in the Northeast while
another quarter is grown in the South. Most of the production in the North
and Northeast is consumed as food for subsistence producers and medium- and
lower-income urban dwellers. In the South and Southeast, cassava is also
consumed largely as human food, although substantial quantities are converted
to industrial starch or used as a carbohydrate source in animal feed. As
much as 20% of total national production may go to non-food uses.
2.        The national average cassava yield in Brazil is about 12 tons ha/year,
but displays wide variation among states as shown in following table. Esti-
mates of average yields at the state level indicate that yields tend to be
higher in the Southeast (15.5 tons/ha) and lowest in the Northeast (10.1
tons/ha). National average yields appear to have declined marginally in
recent years. Major constraints to higher yields include the presence of
serious diseases (particularly bacterial blight and anthracnose), poor
cultural practices and the subsistence nature of the crop which militates
against the use of purchased inputs such as fertilizer.
3.        Well-focused research on cassava is in its infancy in Brazil,
dating essentially from about 1975 when the National Cassava and Fruit
Research Station was established at Cruz das Almas (Bahia) under the auspices
of the Ministry of Agriculture's research unit (EMBRAPA). Today some 17
scientists are involved in the cassava research program at this center in
eight research areas. Some promising results are beginning to emerge,
although another two-three years will be required before EMBRAPA will be
in a position to release for commercial planting a variety (or varieties) with
proven resistance to bacterial blight and which also demonstrates acceptable
characteristics of yield, starch content and maturation period. Research
staff are also making progress in identification of cultural practices which
can improve yields from cultivars which are already widely planted. Four
cultural practices (careful selection of healthy planting material, treatment
of the planting stake with fungicide, planting at the recommended time,
planting with appropriate plant spacing), when employed simultaneously, have
the potential of increasing yields from traditional cultivars by up to 30%
from existing levels. These practices need little additional cash outlay by
farmers, but do require an intensive extension effort if they are to be widely
adopted. At Cruz das Almas these four practices, used with traditional
varieties, but without fertilizer, have produced yields of 22-28 tons/ha/year.
'Using modern inputs, particularly fertilizer, yields of 30-42 tons/ha/year
have been realized.
4.        Sweet sorghum, a crop relatively new to Brazil, is attractive as
a biomass energy source because of: (i) its relatively short vegetative
cycle (4-4.5 months), (ii) its amenability to mechanized production and
harvesting, (iii) the presence of directly fermentable sugars in the stalks



- 71 -
ANNEX 7-2
Page 2
and (iv) the production of sorghum bagasse which can be used as an energy
source in processing and distillation. The crop shows adaptability to a
wider range of soils than does sugarcane and is resistant to moisture
stress. Sweet sorghum also produces some grain by-products which could
be used to offset partly the problems of land substitution by releasing a
portion of land currently used for corn production.
5.        Because of its short production cycle, three promising options for
the use of sweet sorghum in alcohol production are: (i) the cultivation of
the crop in sugarcane areas, using lands which are temporarily idle during
cane renovation; (ii) growing sorghum on lands adjacent to sugarcane for
processing during the off-season when sugarcane is not harvested; or (iii)
substituting sorghum for corn to permit sorghum grain to displace corn grain
for animal feed and use the (sugar) stalk for alcohol production. Systematic
agronomic research on sweet sorghum began in Brazil only in 1977 at EMBRAPA's
National Research Center for Corn and Sorghum at Sete Lagoas, in the State of
Minas Gerais. Even less work has been done in cropping systems research
involving sweet sorghum in association with sugarcane or other crops and on
the commercial utilization of the crop for alcohol production. In Brazil's
National Trials for Sweet Sorghum, 1977-78, stalk yields averaging about 45
tons were registered at 5 locations, with grain yie:Lds of nearly 2.5 tons/ha/crop.
6.        Under present yields in Brazil, sweet sorghum, with two crops per
year, could produce considerably more alcohol per year than sugarcane and
almost twice as much as cassava. If the sorghum grain (starch) was also
converted to alcohol, these yield advantages would be even treater. Evidence
suggests that the energy balance for sweet sorghum may be more favorable than
for sugarcane. Expanded research is required to realize more fully the
energy potential of this crop. In addition to EMBRAPA's work in variety
trials and cultural practices, there is need to focus more effort on crop-
ping systems to determine the feasibility of growing sweet sorghum in asso-
ciation with other alcohol and food crops to intensify land use and extend the
sugarcane milling season.
7.        The Babassu Palm is indigenous to North-Central Brazil and is found
in nine States where it grows in uncultivated stands of varying densities. The
palm covers some 15 million ha in Brazil, of which about 10 million ha are in
Maranhao State. Because of its extensive area and its location in some of the
poorest regions of the country, the babassu palm is frequently viewed as a crop
with considerable potential for generating socio-economic benefits in more dis-
advantaged areas. Despite these promises, relatively little is known of both
the agronomy of the crop and its economic potential. It grows best in a warm,
humid climate on deep, heavy clay soils, although it demonstrates considerable
adaptability to other agro-climatic conditions.
8         Brazil's large quantities of agricultural wastes and residues contain
an energy potential equivalent to 40-50 million tons of petroleum equivalent
(tpe) per annum, although the portion which can be utilized commercially is very
much smaller. A major difficulty with many of these materials is the high cost
of aggregating supplies for conversion relative to their energy content.  The
three most promising waste materials are forest industry residues, alcohol
stillage, and sugarcane bagasse, with an energy content of about 17 million tpe.
In addition, livestock wastes represent a large energy potential, principally
through conversion to methane (biogas).

BRAZIL - ALCOHOL AND BIOMASS ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR MONITORING SYSTEM
A. Introduction
1.        At present, Brazil's National Alcohol Program (PROALCOOL) has
a loosely defined monitoring system which in some areas is insufficient
for Program management decision-making and for properly feeding into
Program evaluation work or long range planning. This Annex describes
the present PROALCOOL system and suggests ways for further improvements.
B.        Existing Situation
2.        The present Alcohol Program is characterized by:
(i) Private sector initiative, with:
- financial subsidies and price controls;
- controls against excessive substitution of sugarcane for
feed crops; and
- demonstrated financial viability of company and project;
(ii) Uniform alcohol pricing throughout the country;
(iii) No Government effort to control or influence regional dispersion
of alcohol production;
(iv) Principal focus on rapid production increase;
(v) CENAL operates only as coordinating body; and
(vi) No systematic monitoring of effects of the Program on the agri-
cultural, energy and transport sectors.
3.        In practice, specific sub-projects are promoted by private companies
based on their situations of location, experience, profit expectations, etc.
Each proposed sub-project is reviewed by CENAL (and IAA or STI) for technical
aspects with simultaneous appraisal by local banks (and the Central Bank)
for financial aspects. The local bank has responsibility for final project
approval largely based on financial factors. This system is efficient for
individual projects and for rapid production expansion with only technical
and financially viable projects and sponsors being approved. The procedures,
however, do not provide for a thorough review of the project's impact on
environment, land use, cropping pattern and land ownership concentration
issues. They also do not allow for a true economic calculation of the



- 73 -                    ANNEX 8-1
Page 2
sub-project, since no assessment is made of (i) alternative uses
of the land devoted to cane, (ii) alcohol distribution and transport
costs for the crops that have been displaced, and (iii) other economic
and social costs.
4.           Indeed, since the Government sets financial prices for
alcohol uniformly across major regions, guarantees the off-take of
alcohol and bears alcohol transportation costs, the investors (and the
authorities) respond to artificial financial signals when deciding a
particular project.  They ignore the economic costs of distributing
the alcohol and displacing alternative crops.
5.           Under the present situation, it is also very difficult to
monitor PROALCOOL's impact on land use. Because of land availability
(particularly pasture land), it has beer assumed that most of the
displacement will, at the margin, be that of cattle. But again, the
only possible monitoring is ex-post, and by then measurements of
PROALCOOL's impact on supply and price for competing crops are blurred
by various exogenous factors such as weather, world markets, etc.
6.           Given the above environment, the Alcohol Program tends to
result in:
(i) emphasis on sugarcane produced on large (and annexed)
systems;
(ii) expansion by existing sugar/alcohol firms;
(iii) expansion in areas with reasonably fertile low-cost
land available in large tracts;
(iv) minimum concern for regional dispersion in develop-
ing alcohol production capacities to correspond
to local gasoline consumption or minimum concern
for regional income disparities. Therefore, some
areas are not served by local production. This
problem is not yet serious since each area can, at
present, absorb the level of production in the
region through a combination of mixed (gasohol)
and pure alcohol;
(v) inadequate attention to land use patterns and
possible effects on food and export crop production
especially in the highly productive crop areas of the
North Central area of Sao Paulo State and to the
employment problems associated with the Northeast.
In the long-run, the present system may well result
in misallocation of land resource use, substantial
social subsidies for transport of alcohol and/or
petroleum and under-production of other agricul-
tural crops; and
(vi) superficial attention to proper methods and policing
of disposal of effluents.

Page 3
C. Monitoring Proposal
7.          The Bank, as part of its loan, is assisting CENAL in the
development of a Monitoring System (as well as independent evaluation
studies--see Annex 8-2) that would help address the above
issues on an ongoing basis and provide the Government with a system that
would serve as a more effective planning tool for future development of the
Alcohol Program and as it relates to other sectors.
8.          The scope of the monitoring system would include
a determination of land use by region considering productivity and
needs for both energy and food and export crops and reflect relative
transportation costs to connect deficit and surplus regions with
alcohol, vegetable oil (diesel substitute), petroleum products and
major agricultural commodities.
9.          The system would require information in the following areas:
(i) Historical Analysis
An analysis of historical data showing, on regional
basis, petroleum product consumption, alcohol production
and consumption, location of distilleries, sugarcane pro-
duction and area, other energy crops such as cassava,
food and export crop production and prices;
(ii) Energy Consumption Projections
A breakdown of future yearly consumption of petroleum
products and alcohol on regional basis and total major
regional consumption centers, and gasoline/alcohol dis-
tribution costs from refineries/distilleries to these
consumption centers. Analysis of resulting petroleum
product mix on refineries, oil imports/exports, status
of diesel/fuel oil substituion program;
(iii) Energy Pricing Analysis
An analysis of pricing of petroleum/alcohol products
and the relationship to consumption/production, con-
servation level desired, subsidies (and overall
impact on energy and agricultural sectors);
(iv) Alcohol Production Possibilities
State by state land utilization patterns. Transporta-
tion and production economics of major agricultural
products, including cane and alcohol;



- 75 -
ANNEX 8-1
Page 4
(v) Optimal Location of New Distilleries
State by state number of proposed new distilleries and
potentially resulting relocation of food and export
crops (including across state lines) so as to minimize
overall production and transport costs for petroleum
products, vegetable oils, alcohol and agricultural
products. Also potential impact of proposed new
distilleries on land and income concentration as a
result of employment (both permanent and seasonal),
food crop production and the land tenure systems
associated with the small peasant economy, particu-
larly that of the precarious tenants (sharecroppers,
"posseiros", etc.);
(vi) Environmental Impact
Analysis of effluent treatment of existing and pro-
posed distilleries, including assessment of impact
on environment of production facilities. Development
of new programs/investments for efficient control
and utilization of waste products as may be needed;
and
(vii) Recommendations
The data collected by the system would be used to
formulate specific recommendations on policy, Alcohol
Program targets and on any corrective measures needed
regarding impact on agriculture and petroleum and trans-
port sectors and the environrent.
10.          The initial study should help enabLe the authorities to
evaluate ex-ante the impact of new distilleries on the energy and
agricultural sectors, and the associated alcohol transportation costs.
It would indicate to the authorities the overa:ll benefits or costs
associated with approving each additional alcohol project in a particu-
lar state, and the likely response of farmers ias they are confronted
with new markets and prices for different crops, including cane.
II.          Such a system would also help the authorities in setting
appropriate alcohol and cane prices for autonomnous distilleries in
different regions, especially those serving isolated markets. Alcohol
and cane prices are now uniformly linked to sugar prices. The pro-
posed study could indicate alcohol economic values, based on local
gasoline opportunity values.
12.          By helping set up explicit alcohol consumption targets
state by state, and by linking them to agricull:ural production poten-
tials (including cane) in the different regions, this study would
help the authorities to orient the implementation of the Alcohol
Program and minimize unnecessary agriculture and transport economic



- 76 -                     ANNEX 8-1
Page 5
costs.  Finally, although it would help the Government monitor the
development of the Program, it would not a priori, lead to a reduction
of the private sector's central role in implementing the Program.
13.         A report would be prepared under the sponsorship of CENAL
but initially should be largely executed by an independent consulting
group with the full cooperation of the Ministries of Agriculture, Mines
and Energy and Industry and Commerce, STI, IAA, CNP, PETROBRAS and other
agencies. A quarterly progress report would be prepared (largely along
the lines of the existing CENAL monthly report but with more analysis
including crop production and petroleum product data). A full updating
report would be prepared annually. Monitoring data would also be made
available to independent consultants or agencies contracted to carry out
evaluations of various aspects of the Program.
D. Suggested Operational Structure
14.         The agricultural part, which should rely highly on the
Ministry of Agriculture and IAA, would include the following areas:
(i) Determination of manageable sub-regions of Brazil
based on broad soil, climate, rainfall, and topo-
graphy criteria, to allow specification of homogenous
agricultural production activities for major crops
in each region;
(ii) Determination of land capability (productivity) and
quantity in each region. There is also a need to
include set-aside acreage to account for minor crops
and subsistence production;
(iii)  Determination of appropriate demand functions for
major agricultural products;
(iv) Determination of regional needs for specific agri-
cultural products and liquid fuels;
(v) Determination of alcohol processing costs and asso-
ciated input needs by feedstock source (or combination)
and processing plant size;
(vi) Determination of net employment effects based on
sources of land to energy crop production and
productivity indices.
E. Petroleum Energy
15.         This section would rely on CNP and PETROBRAS for most of the
data generation and analysis. Information needed would be:



77 -                    ANNEX 8-1
Page 6
(i)  Future supply/demand of petroleum products by region;
(ii)  Distribution costs on regional basis;
(iii) Analysis of fuel oil, gasoline and diesel substitution
programs, and impact on Alcohol Program:, and
(iv)  Impact of prices on domestic consumption of petroleum,
level of substitution, and costs of imports.
F. Environmental
16.         This section should rely, in part, on fe!deral and state
level environmental agencies. Data collected would include:
(i) Audit of effluent disposal practices and environ-
mental impact of existing distilleries;
(ii)  Assessment of future projects in regard to effluent
treatment;
(iii) Development and evaluation of alternative disposal
systems and/or recycling into useful by-products; and
(iv)  Overall assessment of environmental impact of the
Alcohol Program.

BRAZIL - ALCOHOL AND BIOMASS ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
OUTLINE OF TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR EVALUATION SYSTEM
1.           An Evaluation System, independent from Project Management,
should be in charge of on-going and ex-post-facto evaluation of the
Alcohol Program. Successful operation of the evaluation activity will
depend on: ti) high-caliber, imaginative professional staff who have
empathy with the Government decision-making process, rural populations
and experience in applied socio-economic development research; (ii) access
to and frequent use of unencumbered communications with the Alcohol
Program management and executing agencies staff; and (iii) emphasis on
analysis and evaluation (rather than data collection) and use of quali-
tative as much as quantitative information basis.
2.           On-going evaluation results would serve primarily as a con-
tinuing advisory source on implementatioh progress of the Alcohol
Program, and its impact on the agriculture, energy and industrial
sectors. It should also provide rapid isolation of present or potential
implementation difficulties. However, the evaluation system would
also be concerned more with broader Program impact and issues with a
view to policy formulation. On-going evaluation output would comprise:
(i) reports of specific evaluation studies, (ii) evaluation of Program
management, (iii) a major mid-Project evaluation report (during Pro-
ject year 2), as well as (iv) an end-Project evaluation report that
will be required by the Bank upon Project completion.
3.           On-going evaluation studies would be conducted primarily
on a study-by-study basis. They will consist of an expanded analysis
of the Impact Study (Annex 8-5) carried out at the beginning of the
Project on a sample of completed alcohol facilities; and short-term
studies evaluating particular aspects of the Alcohol Program Studies
would be conducted and reported independently of one another but
the evaluation system would be responsible for unified reports of
study findings. Output of the evaluation exercises would go to all
bodies involved in the Alcohol Program, including the World Bank.
4.           Evaluation studies would be qualitative as much as
quantitative. Suggestions of study topics would come from the
evaluation system, project management and technical staff, executing
agencies (CENAL, STI, IAA, CNP, PETROBRAS and other agencies), and
the Bank. A comprehensive plan for evaluation as well as the detailed
terms of reference for the evaluation system and contract with a suita-
bly qualified consulting organization to carryout the initial evaluation
should be presented to the Bank for approval as a condition of effective-
ness of the Bank loan. The main types of study that could be undertaken
would include:
(a) Evaluation of the effectiveness of particular Govern-
ment policies such as pricing, location of new
distilleries, introduction of alternative biomass
feedstocks, and research and development of raw
material production and processing;
(b) The effectiveness of executing agencies (CENAL, STI,
IAA and PETROBRAS, etc.) in carrying out project
activities: e.g., appraising and financing of agri-
cultural and industrial production facilities,
improving technology and diffusing it;
(c) Detailed examination of the effects of PROALCOOL on
land and income distribution, employment, food crop
production and environmental conditions (expanded
analyses similar to those in the initial Impapt Study
described in Annex 8-5); and
(d) Sociological studies of a small number of participant
and non-participant communities. These studies would
be qualitative and interpretive in design.

C. Production Costs - Sugarcane-based Distillery
5.        Production costs, excluding sugarcane,are based on a !'typical"
120,000 liters/day plant located in the Southeast operating at 100% capacity
with a yearly operating period of 180 days. The data presented below were
derived from a review of a sample of recent sub-project proposals submitted to
CENAL for approval and extensive discussions with the managements of a number of
operating facilities as well as with equipment manufacturers and engineering
firms involved in alcohol systems supply.

6.        It is assumed that 50% of the distillery's cane requirement is grown on
the distillery owner's plantation, consistent with current administrative laws
requiring mill/distillery owners to purchase 50% of their cane from owners of
private sugarcane farms unassociated with mills/distilleries. The production cost
of the cane produced on the plantation associated with the distillery has been
estimated at US$8.50 per ton, as detailed below, based on the assumptions dis-
cussed in para 7.08 of the text.

The remainlng 50% of the cane requirement was assumed to be purchased from
independent farmers at the government-controlled price of US$12.0/ton. This
price is assumed to be fixed in current terms for the length of the cutting
season consistent with the current practice.
,jio, ~km_Capital
7.        Ihe main components of alcohol productts working capital are finished
product inventory and accounts receivable. As cane is cropped only during six
months while alcohol is sold evenly during the year, alcohol has to be stocked
for sale in the off-season; average alcohol stocks have been assumed at 3 months
of production. Accounts receivable have been assumed at 45 days of sales. In
line with Brazilian practice, working capital requirements have been assumed to
be 90% financed by short-term debt. Different working capital loans are usually
available for inventories and receivables; their yearly interest rates averaged
33% in 1980, and it has been assumed that they will st:ay at comparable levels in

I/  It has been assumed that (a) all alcohol projects will produce hydrous alcohol to be sold for straight alcohol cars and  (b) the price relationship
between ex-distillery and pump stays at the present level in constant terms over the life of the project.
2/ For simplicity, it has been assumed in this table that all new alcohol projects will operate and be financed as if they were located in the Southeast
region. Due to different lengths of cropping seasons and to different interest rates on government loans according to regions, annual alcohol
output and debt service schedule would be somewhat different. This is not expected to alter significantly the net overall government cash flow due
to the Project.

2.       Disbursements for the agricultural investments have been assumed at
75% the first year and 25% the second year; those of the distillery unit
have been assumed at 30% the first year, 60% the second year and 10% in the
third year. The economic life of the agricultural equipment (tractors, sprayers,
trucks, etc.) has been assumed at 8 years and is replaced by equivalent invest-
went; the distillery unit's economic life is assumed to be 20 years. A
residual value of US$0.5 million is estimated for the balance of 2 years on
the second (final) replacement investment for agricultural equipment; residual
value on the industrial unit (mostly scrapped stainless steel) is estimated at
10% of the initial investment (or US$0.8 million) at the end of the sub-project's
life.

4.       Sugarcane Raw Material Costs:  The economic cost of sugarcane is
derived on the basis of the assumptions discussed in para. 11.12. Detailed
calculations, presented below, are based on regional yields and the utilization
pattersn of the various inputs required for sugarcane growing.

(b)  Land Utilization Schedule.  Generally, the agricultural system will
limit production buildup when the project involves new land and new distillery.
To obtain enough cane to enable the plant to run at 60% capacity, 90% capacity
and 100% capacity the first, second and third years of operation, the following
land utilization schedule is required. This land utilization schedule is
dictated by the fact that it takes 6 months to clear and prepare the land, that
it takes 18 months for the cane to grow after planting and 12 months after
cutting, and that cane can only be cut during six months of the year.

-  10% of C2 land and 1% of Cl land are double counted:  they will be planted again
so that the plantation achieves stabilized production by year 5.
(e)  aTnd !rotal Value:  Following Bank practkce for agricultural pro1ects
land has been valued at the corresponding economic return from the opportunity crop.
On this basis, average land values are calculated at US$44.0, US$16.0 and US$28.0
Der ha Der year for the Southeast, Northeast and South, respectivelv.  They are
derived from the financial rental values presented in para. 7.06 of the text,
shadow-priced by 30% to obtain their economic equivalents. These values are used
in the base case because there is still sufficient land in the regions considered so
that sugarcane for ethanol should not displace food crops and affect significantly
land and food prices until 1985. Since one ton of cane yields on average 70 liters
of ethanol, the cost of the land necessary to support a 120,000 l/d distillery can
be calculated as below:

(d)  Fertilizer Costs:   Fertilizer utilization pattern is the
same in the three regions considered and is assumed as follows:
Fertilizer Utilization Profile              Fertilizer Application Rate
(% of total yearly nutrient use)                    (kg/ha/yr )
p                33                          South East       400

C2               23
c3               24
Total     100
The type and value of fertilizer used vary with the different phases of the
cane production cycle. A 5/20/20/ NPK coumpound is generally applied for planting,
whereas a 10/10/10 NPK compound is used for the three cuttings. Fertilizer
application rates for sugarcane plantations differ between regions: in the
Southeast and average of 400 kg of fertilizer is applied per ha per year, in
the Northeast 500 kg and in the South 350 kg (in the South the distillery is
assumed to obtain its cane from small farmers with low use of agricultural
inputs). Since Brazil is a net importer of each nutrient, economic costs of
tehe 5f20f20 and 10/10710 compounds are derived from international prices.
These costs have been assumed to Increase at 1.5% p.a. as per the assumption
stated in para. 11 H.

(e) Pesticide Costs: Pesticides are assumed to have the same utilization
profile as fertilizers: 33% of total yearly use of pesticides is devoted to the
planting area and 20%, 23% and 24% to the first, second and third cutting areas
respectively. The table below presents pesticide costs for a plantation at
stabilized production.

a/ Labor in the North East has been shadow priced 30%.
Labor is mainly used for cutting. This is reflected in the table below
which presents utilization profile; the decline in labor intensity reflects the
decline in sugarcane yield.

(h) Miscellaneous Costs: These are principally seed costs and lime costs
(about 400 kg per ha of lime is needed for planting). The table below presents
the utilization profile for these miscellaneous items and the yearly costs for a
plantation at stabilized production:

Mi)  Cane Collection Costs:  Estimates of cane collection cost
are based on visits to cane plantations and cooperatives. These estimates
indicate that the unit economic cane transport cost is about US$0.12 per
ton per km, stemming in equal amounts from truck rental, maintenance and
fuel consumption. The fuel component of this cost has been assumed to
increase in parallel with gasoline cost, i.e., 3.5% p.a. Land use pattern
is different in each region. In the Southeast, 65% of the land around the
distillery is devoted to cane growing for the distillery, in the Northeast
about 55%, and in the South only 30% (since it has been assumed that the
cane will come from small dispersed landowners). The cane collection costs
for 120,000 lpd distillery in the different regions are as follows:
