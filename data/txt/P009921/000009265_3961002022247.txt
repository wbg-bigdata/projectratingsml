MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMFNT ASSCCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA
FOR A SHRIMP AND FISH CULTURE PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on z proposed credit of SDR
62.9 million (US$ 85 millior. equivalent) to India is submitted for approval.
The Credit would be on standard IDA terms with 35 years matuxity. The Credit
would help finance a Shrimp and Fish Culture Project in the States of West
Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa and Bihar. The procaeds of the
*       Credit would be passed by the Government of India (GOI) to the Governments of
the implementing States in accordance with the standard arrangements for
development assistance to the States. GOI will assume the foreign exchange
*        risk.
2.    Backarjund.  The Fish (including shrimp) subsector contributes about
2.6% of the agricultural GDP and less than '% of total GDP. However its
importance lies in the fact that it provides employment to an estimated 9
million people mainly from the poorer coastal communities, contributing to
increasing the nutritional standards, .nd as a foreign exchange earner. The
growth in the industry over the past decade has been rapid at nearly 6% per
annum. While India has been one of the world's largest producers and
exporters of marine shrimp since 1987, its position in the world market has
been eroded as catches of marine shrimp have stagnated while the production of
cultured shrimp in the Southeast Asian countries has increased tremendously.
There is, however, tremendous potential for the development of brackish water
shrimp culture in India wi;h Its long coastline, its tropical climate and
large iver deltas. At prasent, shrimp culture is based on traditional
extensive culture, as a result of which yields are extremely low, averaging
about 200-300 kgs per hectare (ha). For inland fisheries, there are abundant
water areas for production. Government estimates show over 25,000 kms of
rivers and tributaries and ovar 2.5 mill-on ha of reservoirs, lakes, swamps
and ponds.  Freshwater aquaculture is undertaken in ox-bow lakes and
rescrvoirs, which are exploited by fishermen cooperatives. At present,
productivity in ox-bow lakes and reservoirs is low due to poor management and
inadequate stocking, in addition to siltation and weed infestation in ox-bow
lakes.
3.    LAssons from Past sank Lending.  The previous project in the subsector
was the First Inland Fisheries Project, which successfully increased carp
production in ponds through scientific fish farming including the introduction
of hatcheries as the basis for a fish seed industry. The project had positive
results with fish farmers achieving an FRR of 100% (55% estimated) and an ERR
of 65% (42% estimated). However, project implementation took three years
longer than planned due to delays in: (a) securing project sites and in
agreeing the design of fish hatcheries, and (b) arranging collateral for
credit to the poorer beneficiaries. During the period of delay, the private
sector, who were not planned in the project, provided hatcheries. The lessons
learnt were taken into consideration in project design: (a) sites have
already been secured; (b) private sector participation has been promoted
throughout the project; and (c) collateral for credit has already been agreed.
4.    Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Bank Group's strategy to India is to
support policies and investments that encourage economic growth and poverty
alleviation in a context of macro-economic restructuring. The emphasis is on
efficient resource allocation, increased efficiency of the public sector and
appropriate targeting and delivery of support systems for the poor. The
proposed project fits well within this framework. An important element of the



2
strategy is to support sustainable programs, especially in agriculture, that
would promote and enhance the natural resource base. The Bank with its
resources, wide experience and availability of expertise in the shrimp and
fish sector would support institutional development, and impact policy
development including the encouragement of the private sector.
5.    Proiect Oh'e tives.  The project would help India to maintain its
position as a majcr world exporter of shrimps for which it has a comparative
advantage because of its low labor costs and conducive climate. The project,
through increased shrimp and fish production, would improve the economic and
social welfare of some of the poorest sections of the conmunity, also ensuring
that appropriate benefits accrue to women.   The project would also increase
foreign exchange earnings, improve the use of low productivity land, combined
with the protection of ecologically vulnerable areas, create employment and
foster rural development. The project would improve the livelihood of some
14,000 very poor kouseholds with few alternatives, 90% of whom currently earn
below Rs 3,000 (US$110) per annum with some earning below Rs 1,000 (US$ 37),
with all practicing some form of subsistence fishing in which men, women and
children are involved.
6.    Project Description.  The Project, which would be implemented over a
seven year period, comprises: (a) a brackish water shrimp component
supporting shrimp aquaculture on about 3,800 ha in the states of West Bengal,
Orissa, and Andhra Pradesh, representing about 80% of project cost; (b) an
inland fisheries component supporting fish culture in reservoirs, 46,000 ha
&nd ox-bow lakes, 5,000 ha in West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and
Uttar Pradesh, representing about 8% of project cost; and (c) project
management including environmental management and training representing about
12% of proje(t cost. For shrimp aquaculture, the project would bring together
entrepre.eurs to work with beneficiaries from the weakest socio-economic
sections of the country (30:70 ratio). Semi-intensive brackish water shrimp
culture would be introduced increasing shrimp production from 250-300 kg/ha to
2,000 kg/ha. Tho State Governments would construct the development on owned
lands and recover its cost, including interest, through lease charges. Credit
for related activities such as hatcheries and feed plants would be provided to
private sector investors. For the fish component, the state Governments would
provide the infrastructure development necessary, with credit provided to
private entrepreneurs for hatcheries and ice plants, and to cooperatives for
rearing ponds, cages, pens and stocking of water bodies. The development of
fish cooperatives including technical assistance and training would also be
important aspects of the Project.
7.    The total project cost, net of taxes and duties, is estimated at US$95
million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$10 million (11%).
The proposed credit would finance about 90% of total project cost net of taxes
and duties. To facilitate an early start to the project, retroactive
financing up to US$2 million would be provided to cover eligible project
expenditures incurred before signing but after the date of the appraisal
mission (July 31, 1991). Project completion would be December 31, 1998 and
the closing date would be June 30, 1999. A breakdown of the costs and the
financing plan is in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and the
disbursement schedule are in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in India are in
Schedules C and D, respectively. Maps, IBRD Nos. 23344, 23345 are attached.
Staff Appraisal Report No. 10046-IN, dated December 16, 1991 is being
distributed separately.

8.   aImlemtAttAo'.  To implement the proposed Project, a Central Project
Unit (CPU) would be created within the Fisheries Division of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Cooperatives (M&A) and, a State Project Unit (SPU) w_thin the
Department of Fisheries in each of the States. Consultants would be recruited
to assist the CPU in providing technical know how and project monitoring.
Extension services would be provided at the state level by Brackish water
Farmer's Develooment Agency (BFDA) and the Fish Farmer's Development Agency
(FFDA) for the shrimps and fish components respectively. The BFDAs would also
operate the common facilities in the shrimp pond clusters at a cost to the
beneficiaries.  In addition, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) would be
encouraged to provide and assist the beneficiaries from the poorer sections in
group dynamics, the absorption of technical know-how, and to be responsive to
the commercial aspects of shrimp and fish farming. Credit for such sub-
projects would be provided by the states at their own risk, channelled through
participating banks on commercial terms. Sub-projects would be evaluated by
the commercial banks, with the credit equal to 80% of investment cost, and
repayable over 10 years with interest at commercial rates. In addition, the
participating banks would also act as agents to recover lease payments.
9.    Ag7eed Actions.  Agreements rea',x>d with the GOI and the participating
States at negotiations include: (a) project sites selected would be
acceptable to the Association; (b) hatcheries and feedmill3 constructed by the
States would be managed by autonomous private entrepreneurs, and would be
divested as soon as possible; (c) the beneficiaries would be selected in
accordance with the procedures agreed with the Association; (d) the lease and
credit arrangements agreed with the Association would be adhered to; (e) the
arrangement for the selection of Project cooperatives including the adoption
of the revised by-laws would be adhered to; and (f) appropriate envircnmental
management plans would be implemented by each state. As a Condition of
Zffectivenes=, Participating Agreements between the states and selected banks,
incorporating their participation in the delivery of credit and recovery of
sub-loans and lease charges would be submitted to the Association.
10.   EZnvironmental Aspects.  For the shrimp component, the Project would
convert some of the most marginal coastal saline soils to productive shrimp
ponds.  To prevent, reduce or eliml.nate potential negative effects of the
project on the environment, a comprehensive Environmental Management and
Monitoring Plan was prepared. This plan included interventions such as
revegetation with mangrove trees of selected sites, monitoring of wild shrimp
seed stock collection, training and extension in shrimp and fisheries
conservation and management, construction of sluice gates for effective water
management and assay of shrimp flesh for potential contamination from heavy
metals.
11.   Tmnact of the Pro ject on women.  For women, who play a large part in the
fisheries sector, the Project would require their participation in ownership
and management of shrimp ponds and in participating fish cooperatives.
Training programs would require women to be included from the earliest stage
and women officers would be engaged in the BFDAs and FFDAs. In addition,
women would be encouraged to participate as small entrepreneurs to receive
credit.
12. Private Sertor Development. The Project would promote private sector
participation and entrepreneurs would own ponds (para. 6). While the common
facilities of shrimp farms would initially be managed by BFDAs, beneficiaries'
owned Production Groups would assume management responsibilities within 5
years. 2roject investments for infrastructure support facilities such as



4
hatcheries and feed mills would be for private entrepreneurs only.
Cooperatives in the inland fisheries component would all be required to
operate au'onomously as private sector entities.
13.   Projlct Sustainahility.  About 75 percent of project costs would be
recoverable through lease payments. The unrecoverable portion would relate to
cyclone protection dykes, part of infrastructure for ox-bow lakes, access
roads, electricity connections, and project management and extension. Project
beneficiaries wouli have adequate income to finance their own operating costs
and after full development, extension and training.
14.   Prg4Ct aenAfitg    .dikj.  The main benefits of the Project would be
increased shrimp and freshwatur carp production. Total annual production of
shrimp from the project is estimated to be about 7,600 tons. Fish production
is estimated to increase to about 7,800 tons, of which 38% would be from ox-
bow lakes and 62% from reservoirs. Employment and higher income would be
provided for over 5,200 families in the brackish water areas and for nearly
9,000 households througa over 200 fishermen cooperatives. The economic rate
of raturn for the shrimps component is estimated at 31% and for the inland
fisheries component 25%. ard the overall economic rate of return for the
Project is estimated at 30%.
15.   The main risks of the project are associated with the shrimp component
and would be related to: (a) institutional difficulties associated with
project implementation; (b) the introduction of suitable technology for site
design and the development and phasing of appropriate hatcheries and feed
facilities; (c) the States' resolve to implement and enforce the features of
the lease and credit programs; (d) a decline in the price of shrimp; and (e)
an increase in the price of feed. The above risks would be mitigated by: (a)
the incentives created by the high financial returns expected under the
project, and the substantial attraction to investors for the opportunity to
earn much sought after foreign exchange; (b) the provision for experienced
technical consultants, and the inclusion of an independent management
organization to assist in project monitoring; and (c) linkages with the
collection agencies, the sale of produce and the sale of inputs from
hatcheries and feed mills, in addition to provisions to utilize production as
security for sub-loans. Sensitivity tests show the risks associated with the
price of shrimps and feed to be acceptable. The major risk for the inland
fisheries component relates to the ability of the participating cooperatives
to absorb the institutional development provided. However, revised by-laws
increased member participation, the greater involvement of women, and the
support of NGOs should mitigate the risk. The significant success of the
First Inland Fisheries Project (para. 3) must also be considered a positive.
16.   Rammendati=. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
