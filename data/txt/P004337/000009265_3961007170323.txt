MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALDIVES
FOR A SECOND EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed credit to the Republic of Maldives for SDR 9.3 million, equivalent to US$13.4 million, on
standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance a project in education and training.
The Project will also be partially financed, under parallel financing, by the Australian International
Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) with US$1.2 million equivalent and by the Islamic
Development Bank (IDB) with US$2.3 million equivalent.
I. Bank Group Assistance Strategy
2.         The Bank group assistance strategy is outlined in a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
being circulated under separate cover. The proposed credit is fully consistent with the country
policies and the CAS.
II. The Sector and Proposed Credit
3.         Education and skills development are critical to any country, but especially so in the
Maldives with its rapidly growing population, fragile eco-system, and limited range of economic
opportunities. The Maldivian population is very young -- close to one-third is in school -- and
demand for education is strong and rising. At the same time, skill shortages pervade the economy.
Large numbers of expatriates have been temporarily employed to meet these skill gaps. The Maldives
needs to focus on education to sustain the expansion of its fisheries and tourism-based economy, to
develop alternative sources of employment, to begin the hand-over of skilled posts from expatriates to
nationals and to create the awareness needed to slow population growth. With the rising population,
government expenditures for education services have been increasing and the Maldives needs to find
ways to generate resources through charging fees to the privileged, while improving the effective use
of the available resources. This dual approach will improve access to quality education, improve
equity and upgrade the education system. Particular effort would be made to increase the coverage in
the atolls where the largest percentage of the poor reside.
4.         Background. The proposed Second Education and Training Project is based on a
detailed analysis of the education sector and a comprehensive labor/skills analysis. The Ministry of
Education (MOE) oversees the operations, policies, staffing and financing of primary, secondary and
teacher training activities. However, atoll communities and the private sector play a key role since
they operate 45 and 10 percent of the primary and lower secondary schools, respectively, leaving only
some 45 percent to the Government. At the upper secondary level there is only one government
school, located in the capital city, Male. During the last decade education expanded rapidly, reaching
gross enrollment rates of over 133 percent at the primary, 21 percent at the secondary and about 3
percent at the post-secondary levels. These rates are favorable but conceal great disparities in quality
in primary education, access between urban and rural areas (mainly poor), resource allocation and
sex disparities at the upper secondary education level, where female participation drops to about 39
percent. Government efforts to reach universal primary education, expand secondary education and



2
invest in skill training programs have been hampered by the rapid population growth, inappropriate
policies, shortages of trained staff, secondary facilities which barely accommodate 20 percent of the
primary completers and funding mechanisms which remain inconsistent with needs.
5.           A striking feature of secondary education is that over 70 percent of the fee-paying
students attending private schools come from the atolls, while the more privileged students from
Male' have access to free education in government schools. The lack of access to secondary
education, particularly in the atolls, has limited the number of trainees available for skill training.
Serious skill shortages, in all areas of development, were identified by the 1993 labor/skill studies.
Matters have been made more difficult by a bonding system which favours government recruits or
employees to benefit from national skill training and post-secondary fellowships abroad. To date,
participants from the private sector, where the greatest skill shortages exist, even those willing to
reimburse the costs, have been excluded from fellowships. Thus, actions to improve access to
secondary education, to make more candidates available for training programs and to increase the
effective use of external training fellowships require attention if the skill gap and the costly
employment of expatriates (which causes a serious financial drain) is to be reduced. Because so much
catch-up was needed, increases in education expenditures (from 10 percent of the total budget in 1988
to about 18 percent in 1993) still have not allowed Government to keep up with emerging training
needs of a growing economy. Yet free education is given to students in elite government secondary
schools, to trainees in skill training programs and to recipients of external fellowships. Policies
allowing for more equitable access to training programs are needed to improve the skill level of the
increasing number of secondary completers.
6.          Proiect Objectives. The Project would support policy-based investments to: (a) improve
primary and secondary education quality, targeting opportunities for the poor; (b) reduce the shortage
of teachers at the primary and secondary levels focusing on teacher needs in the atolls; (c) upgrade
atoll primary teachers (80 percent women); (d) make secondary education more widely available in
the atolls (where 70 percent of the population lives and where less than 20 percent of the access
exists). Also, to focus on increasing female participation and, by developing the scope and
mechanisms of cost recovery in government schools, to support improvements in education quality;
(e) reduce skill shortages by increasing the suitability of national skill programs and making these
more sustainable; (f) upgrade staff at the health, vocational, management and teacher training
institutions; (g) increase the economic responsiveness of, and access to, post-secondary fellowship
training opportunities by allocating training to both public and private sector recipients mainly in
lower cost regional institutions, by supporting graduate employment in the private sector and by
introducing fellowship cost recovery measures; and (h) strengthen financial management of the
education sector.
7.          Proiect Description. The Project would:
(a)   upgrade education qualitv by establishing an in-country lower secondary teacher training
program to meet immediate needs and the long-term goal of gradually reducing the
number of expatriate teachers; strengthening the pre-service teacher training program
and increasing the availability of teachers' learning materials; upgrading primary atoll
teachers through in-service training; remodelling facilities for the Institute for Teacher
Education (ITE); and by establishing efficiency indicators in order to monitor and
manage the education system;



3
(b)  increase eQuitable access to quality secondary education for about 1,400 additional
students in the atolls by adding lower secondary grades 8-10 to four selected Atoll
Education Centers and establishing a new lower secondary school in the north;
maintaining a career information and guidance program; and undertaking policy reforms
in secondary education including consolidating atoll secondary education, recovering
costs at the secondary level in government schools to improve quality, continuing the
recent flexible administration of the bonding of secondary school leavers and assisting
with the implementation of more economical and equitable student:teacher ratios and
staff deployment policies;
(c)   reduce skill shortages by developing at the Maldives Center for Management and
Administration (MCMA), fee-paying modular courses that would respond to both private
and public sectors; improving the quality of existing and new skill training programs at
the MCMA, ITE, Institute of Health Sciences and Vocational Training Center (VTC)
through staff training programs; and providing facilities at MCMA and equipment and
books at MCMA and VTC;
(d)  increase the responsiveness to economic priorities for overseas post-secondary training
by selecting the best candidates under a criteria based fellowship program. The program
would allocate about 25 percent of the fellowships to the private sector with about 80
percent of all fellowships offered at lower cost regional institutions. Sustainability would
be supported by the introduction of cost recovery measures for the establishment of an
ongoing fellowship program. The hiring into the public sector would be on a needs
basis and graduates would be allowed to select employment in either the public or
private sectors;
(e)   strengthen financial management of the education sector by improving financial practices
and mechanisms to provide more equitable grants and financial support to educational
institutions; and
(f)   undertake priority studies in the education sector.
8.         Project Implementation and Financing. Government has demonstrated its capacity to
implement a project of this size. That capacity was further strengthened during the first Education
Project. Coordination for project implementation is expected to remain within the Ministry of
Planning, Human Resources and Environment (MPHRE) assisted by the MOE and the Ministry of
Finance and Treasury (MOFT). The inter-ministerial Project Coordinating Committee effectively
utilized under the first Project will continue. The total Project is estimated to cost US$17.9 million
with about US$13.4 million equivalent to be financed by IDA with parallel financing of US$1.2
million equivalent by AIDAB and US$2.3 million equivalent by IDB. The estimated project costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The amounts and methods of procurement and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events is
given in Schedule C. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 13394-MAL, is being distributed separately.
9.         Proiect Sustainabilitv. Government is according human resources development a high
priority in its development plans. Because of expected cost recovery measures at the secondary and
skills levels and for post-secondary fellowships, it is estimated that the Project may help Government
reduce recurrent costs (excluding expansion of the system). Of particular importance is the



4
introduction of the in-country lower secondary teacher training program. This program, through the
replacement of costly expatriates teachers (who make-up 75% of the teaching force and whose
salaries/allowances cost twice as much as that of identically qualified nationals), would reduce the
country's annual recurrent salary costs from about US$250,000 following the first lower secondary
teacher training output, reaching a cumulative recurrent salary saving of over US$4.0 million per
annum by the end of the Project. In addition, the implementation of external and internal efficiency
education indicators and stricter teacher:pupil ratios could promote rationalization and better use of
resources and reduce the present number of primary teachers by 20 percent (aside from growth due to
rising students numbers). At the secondary level the implementation of consolidated school expansion
policies would limit investments to viable schools, make better use of teachers and resources, and
facilitate more equitable access in the atolls. The introduction of stricter academic and economically-
based fellowship selection criteria open to both public and private candidates, and the introduction of
cost recovery measures for all fellowship recipients, would allow Government to establish a national
fellowship program. The Project would take steps to strengthen the financial management and
equitable allocation of education sector resources. All the above efforts should strengthen
management and enhance project sustainability. The Staff Appraisal Report includes the
Government's policy letter and matrix which support the above efforts and emphasize improvements
in education access and quality, financial management and sustainability of the education and training
programs in the Maldives.
10.        Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement. The first IDA involvement in the
sector, the ongoing Education and Training Project (Credit 1981-MAL for US$8.19 million), has
been very positive, and implementation has been accomplished within the established time frame.
Other ongoing IDA operations in fisheries and the transportation sector are being implemented
satisfactorily. In the ongoing Project, the establishment of the Southern Secondary School in an atoll
greatly increased equitable access, resulted in a sharp increase in female participation and improved
education quality. The scholarship program contributed towards important skill reductions at the
senior management level and experienced a 100 percent return of trainees. However, the costs for
the fellowships, which were primarily in OECD countries, were high; lower cost regional training
options have to be found. Government has systematically followed-up the manpower and teacher
studies recommendations, and the operation of the Project Coordinating Committee was efficient with
able staff assigned to manage the Project. On the basis of that positive experience, it is felt that
Government is capable of efficiently managing the proposed Project.
11.        Rationale for IDA Involvement. On the basis of the policy dialogue experienced during
the ongoing Project and during preparation of the proposed Project, Government wishes to have IDA
continue its role. The main reason for IDA involvement is its capacity to assist Government to
develop and implement policy measures which other donors are reluctant to deal with. The Bank is
the largest donor and its staff's intercountry knowledge is assisting the Maldives to deal with human
resources development sector issues. Within the difficult economic situation faced by the country,
support for the education sector remains a priority and, unless such assistance is better directed, the
recent positive developments, in access of basic education and skill reduction, could suffer a set-back.
The proposed Project sets the framework for such a structured approach and for the rationalization of
resources allocated to the sector. The proposed credit is fully consistent with the CAS which is
scheduled to be discussed on March 21, 1995.



5
12.        Agreed Actions:
During Negotiations the Government provided assurances that it would:
(a)   each year carry out a teacher demand and supply analysis and complete a teacher
recruitment strategy;
(b)   maintain a career information and guidance program;
(c)   implement a secondary school consolidation expansion policy and finalize the scope and
mechanisms for the implementation of recovery of costs at that level;
(d)   establish at the Maldives Center for Management and Administration an autonomous
program budget supervised by the Management Council;
(e)   implement measures for the recovery of costs of the fellowship program while
maintaining staff, resources and responsibilities satisfactory to the Association at the
National Scholarship Board and Project Implementation Unit;
(f)   review the financing of education and training services;
(g)   carry-out with conditions satisfactory to the Association studies, training and fellowship
under the project; and
(h)   carry-out with the co-financiers an annual review of education and project indicators and
a comprehensive mid-term review.
13.        Poverty Categorv and Program Objectives. The proposed Project has taken into
consideration all the recommendations of the Updating Economic Memorandum for the Republic of
Maldives issued in July, 1994, and of the country assistance strategy. As indicated below the Project
will target the rural poor by focusing on the upgrading of rural primary teachers, expanding
secondary access in the atolls and focusing on women and the rural disadvantaged. Work towards
more equitable allocations of skill training and fellowships in both the public and private sectors
including safety nets for the poor would support the country's antipoverty strategy.
14.        Environmental Assessment. No negative environmental impact is expected. Rather
increased access to secondary education and updated primary, secondary and teacher training
programs, which include environmental topics will benefit the country. For this Project, Government
has agreed not to use coral in any construction activity.
15.        Participatory Approach. Representatives from the Atoll Education Centers, the heads of
the concerned institutions and parental committees were consulted during project preparation. The
National Scholarship Board including private sector representation coordinated the preparation of the
fellowship and training components. Other donors active in the country were kept informed, resulting
in parallel financing arrangements with AIDAB and IDB and supplementary assistance from ADB.
The sector preparation team consulted with the IMF economic mission and key missions were
overlapped to ensure coordination. The preparation team met with the national coordination team
which included representatives from all sectors, and met with private sector representatives to discuss



6
sector policies, cost recovery measures and the serious skill gap. Government intends to continue this
important national dialogue to ensure effective implementation.
16.         Project Benefits. The benefits to be derived from the Project are as follows:
(a)   the teacher education component is expected to: (i) improve the quality of primary education;
(ii) reduce the number of untrained teachers in primary schools (mainly women); and (iii) lower the
costs of employing secondary teachers by training Maldivians rather than hiring costly expatriates;
(b)   the secondary education component would: (i) increase access to quality secondary education
for some 1,400 additional atoll students, including female and poor students; (ii) flexible
administration of the student system bonding would be implemented to allow them to select
employment in either the public or private sectors; and (iii) institute limited cost recovery measures in
government schools for quality improvements;
(c)   the skill training program and institutional staff training activities would: (i) substitute
Maldivians for expatriates in skilled jobs in the public and private sectors by providing local access to
skill training; (ii) reduce skill shortages in the civil service; and (iii) improve the output of the health,
vocational and management institutions;
(d)   the fellowship program would: (i) provide fellowships for both the public and private sectors;
(ii) strengthen the links between economic needs and fellowship allocations; (iii) improve fellowship
selection criteria and cost recovery mechanisms to promote sustainability; and (iv) increase the
number of beneficiaries by directing more fellows into lower cost regional institutions;
(e)   the financial plan would: (i) strengthen budget management; and (ii) establish financial
formulas to use the allocated resources more effectively; and
(f) the studies would improve sector knowledge and decision-making.
17.         Risks. The main risks identified include the possibility of: (i) difficulties in reaching
consensus on secondary cost recovery strategies; (ii) resistance in the atolls to secondary consolidated
expansion policies which limit support only to secondary schools of a viable size; (iii) delays in the
establishment of an autonomous program budget for the MCMA; and (iv) potential reluctance to
implement sustainable management and financial policies in spite of the precarious macro-situation
which needs redressing to ensure that spending in the sector will be sufficient to allow the project
inputs to be sustained.
18.         These risks are minimized, however, by Government's realization that due to the very
difficult economic situation in the Maldives, education policies will have to be changed, especially
those relating to cost recovery at the secondary level and in the fellowship program, and to limiting
the establishment of atoll secondary schools to those of a viable size. In addition, the MPHRE which
recently assumed responsibility for the operation of the MCMA, plans to support the paying of fees
for training at this institution. Finally, due to its difficult fiscal situation, Government accepts that the
financial processes for education and training activities need to be consolidated and use of the limited
resources maximized. On that basis, they support a review of financial procedures and mechanisms
for allocation of education funds based on formulas.

19.        Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
