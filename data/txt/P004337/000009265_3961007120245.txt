This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission which visited the Republic of the Maldives in June 1994 comprising Mr. Albert
Aime (Senior Education Planner - Task Manager), Ms. Ruth Montague (Architect), Mr. Ralph Rawlinson (Educator) and Mr. Steve Tabor
(Economist). Peer Reviewers for this project were Ms. C. Valdivieso, Principal Operations Officer (MN2PH), Mr. G. Hancock, Educator
(AF4PH), Mr. D. Holsinger, Educator (ESP), and Mr. H. Codippily, Country Economist (EA3CO). Mr. Paul Isenran, Director
(SAIDR), and Ms. Barbara Herz, Chief (SAIPH) have endorsed the Project.



REPUBLIC OF MALDIVES
SECOND EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:        Republic of Maldives
Amount:          SDR 9.3 million (US$13.4 million)
Co-Financing:    Australian Int'l Development Assistance Bureau US$ 1.2 million (Grant)
Islamic Development Bank                  US$ 2.3 million (IDB terms)
Terms:           Standard IDA, with 40 years maturity
Description:     The Project would support policy-based investments in basic education and skills
development to: (a) improve primary and secondary education quality, targeting
opportunities for the poor; (b) reduce the shortage of teachers at the primary and
secondary levels focusing on the atolls' teacher needs; (c) upgrade atoll primary
teachers (80 percent women); (d) make secondary education more widely available
in the atolls (where 70 percent of the population lives and where less than 20
percent of the access exists). Also, to focus on increasing female participation
and, by developing the scope and mechanisms for cost recovery in government
schools, to support improvements in education quality; (e) reduce skill shortages
by increasing the suitability of national skill training programs and making these
more sustainable; (f) upgrade staff at the health, vocational, management and
teacher training institutions; (g) increase the economic responsiveness of, and
access to, post-secondary fellowship training opportunities by allocating training
to both public and private sector recipients mainly in lower cost regional
institutions, by supporting graduate employment in the private sector and by
introducing fellowship cost recovery measures; and (h) strengthen financial
management of the education sector.
To achieve the above, the Project would: (a) establish an in-country lower
secondary teacher training program at the Institute for Teacher Education and
strengthen pre- and in-service primary teacher training programs; (b) improve
access to secondary education in the atolls through building, equipping and
staffing five lower secondary schools in the atolls; (c) develop in-country fee-
paying skill training programs at the Maldives Center for Management and
Administration (MCMA) accessible to both public and private trainees, and
support staff development in health, vocational and management education;
(d) support overseas post-secondary fellowship training for qualified Maldivian
students to fill critical skill gaps in the public sector and provide a pool of trained
personnel to meet private sector labor market requirements; (e) establish more
effective financial procedures and assist with management and policy support in
the education sector; and (f) undertake priority studies in the education sector.
i



Benefits:      The benefits to be derived from the Project are as follows: (a) the teacher education
component is expected to: (i) improve the quality of primary education; (ii) reduce the
number of untrained teachers in primary schools (mainly women); and (iii) lower the
costs of employing secondary teachers by training Maldivians rather than hiring costly
expatriates; (b) the secondary education component would: (i) increase access to
quality secondary education for some 1,400 additional atoll students, including female
and poor students; (ii) flexible administration of the student bonding system would be
implemented to allow them to select employment in either the public or private
sectors; and (iii) institute limited cost recovery measures in government schools for
quality improvements; (c) the skill training program and institutional staff training
activities would: (i) substitute Maldivians for expatriates in skilled jobs in the public
and private sectors by providing local access to skill training; (ii) reduce skill
shortages in the civil service; and (iii) improve the output of the health, vocational and
management institutions; (d) the fellowship program would: (i) provide fellowships for
both the public and private sectors; (ii) strengthen the links between economic needs
and fellowship allocations; (iii) improve fellowship selection criteria and cost recovery
mechanisms to promote sustainability; and (iv) increase the number of beneficiaries by
directing more fellows into lower cost regional institutions; (e) the financial plan
would: (i) strengthen budget management; and (ii) establish financial formulas to use
the allocated resources more effectively; and (f) the studies would improve sector
knowledge and decision-making.
Risks:         The main risks identified include the possibility of: (a) difficulties in reaching
consensus on secondary cost recovery strategies; (b) resistance in the atolls to
secondary consolidated expansion policies which limit support only to secondary
schools of a viable size; (c) delays in the establishment of an autonomous program
budget for the MCMA; and (d) potential reluctance to implement sustainable
management and financial policies in spite of the precarious macro-situation which
needs redressing to ensure that spending in the sector will be sufficient to allow the
project inputs to be sustained.
These risks are minimized, however, by Government's realization that due to the very
difficult economic situation in the Maldives, education policies will have to be
changed, especially those relating to cost recovery at the secondary level and in the
fellowship program, and to limiting the establishment of atoll secondary schools to
those of a viable size. In addition, the Ministry of Planning, Human Resources and
Environment which recently assumed responsibility for the operation of the MCMA,
plans to support the paying of fees for training at this institution. Finally, due to its
difficult fiscal situation, Government accepts that the financial processes for education
and training activities need to be consolidated and use of the limited resources
maximized. On that basis, they support a review of financial procedures and
mechanisms for allocation of education funds based on formulas.

REPUBLIC OF MALDIVES
SECOND EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROJECT
I. SECTORAL BACKGROUND AND ISSUES
A. The Economic Setting for Education and Skills Development
1.1        Education and skills development are critical to any country, but perhaps especially
so in the Republic of Maldives with its rapidly growing population, fragile eco-system, and
limited range of economic opportunities. The Maldivian population is very young -- close to a
third of the population is in school -- and demand for education is strong and rising. At the same
time, skill shortages are pervasive throughout the economy. Large numbers of expatriates have
been employed temporarily to meet these skill gaps. Maldives needs to focus on education to
sustain the expansion of its fisheries and tourism-based economy, to develop alternative sources
of employment, to begin the handover of skilled posts from expatriates to national citizens and to
create the awareness needed to slow population growth.
1.2        The Republic of Maldives is an archipelago of about 1,198 small coral islands in the
Indian Ocean, grouped into 26 atolls and forming a long narrow chain. The total land area is
less than 300 square kilometers spread over 90,000 square kilometers of ocean. Approximately
200 of the islands are inhabited, and of these, only 3 have populations greater than 4,000
persons. The highly dispersed and scattered nature of population settlement makes
communication difficult and increases the difficulties and the costs of delivering social services.
1.3        Despite limited natural resources, geographical fragmentation and population
dispersion, Maldives' economic growth record has been impressive. Between 1985 and 1993, the
economy grew by more than 9 percent per annum. Since that time, economic growth has slowed
to 6.3 percent in 1992 and 6.2 percent in 1993 as a result of a weaker performance in tourism
and a decrease in fish exports.
1.4       In 1994, the population was estimated at 245,910, increasing at an annual rate of 3.2
percent. The annual per capita GDP was estimated at US$929. In 1990, the literacy rate in the
national language (Dhivehi) was about 98 percent and was equal for both sexes. During the last
decade, access to education expanded rapidly, reaching in 1993 a gross enrollment rate of over
133 percent at primary, 21 percent at secondary and about 3 percent at post-secondary'. These
rates are favorable considering recent growth, but still lag behind the Asia region's averages of
96 percent at primary, 60 percent at secondary and 4 percent at post-secondary.
1/ Gross enrollment rates of over 100 percent are due to the inclusion of repeaters and over-aged students in the primary grades,
especially in atoll schools.



I
1.5         Rapid economic growth in recent years has generated demiiand for public sector
spending which has not beeni matchled by commlaenisurate increases in public sector revenues. The
fiscal deficit has widened from1 3 percent of GDP in 1989 to 16 percenit in 1993. Domestic
borrowing was increased to finance the deficit, resulting in rapid growth in the money supply,
double-digit price intlation. a decline in official foreign exclianige reserves, and a deterioration in
public sector credit wortlilness. Reversing the course of decelerating growtlh and gaping budget
deficits are the near-termll macroeconomiiic objectives ot Governmlenit. Meetiig widespread
demand for increased access to educationi will be dilficult in a macroeconomic environment of
fiscal restraint.
1.6         Labor Force Characteristics. Althoughl economic growth has slowed, and the
financial system has become less stable, the economly contin1ues to generate labor demands well in
excess of domestic labor supply capacity. Despite the 3.4 percent annual population growth rate,
the number of Maldivian workers in the labor force has actually fallen during the past two
decades. This is due to: (a) the highi dependenicy ratio and a skewiig of the population age-
profile towards clildreni under 15 years of age; (b) an increase in educational opportunities for
children, together with restrictions on the em1ploymiienit of miinors; and (c) a dramatic fall in the
female participation rate in the labor force between 1977 and 1985, resulting mainly from the
substitution of fish freezing an(d canining technologies for atoll-based fish smoking and salting.
The excess labor demanids have beeni mzet largely througlh the employmiienit of expatriates.
Maldives has one of the most openi labor mlarkets in the world. 13etween the years 1990 and
1993, the number of expatriate workers employed in Maldives doubled to reach 17,200,
representing nearly one-third of the total labor force. P'ractically all professional fields and
technical trades, witlh the exception of fisheries and public administrationi, are dominated by
expatriate laborers. Of the expatriates, about 70 percent are skilled or semi-skilled workers, and
a quarter are employed by Governmiiienit. Domestic unemiiploymiienit reiniiis low at about 3 percent
of the labor force, and skilled Maldivians frequently work botlh for Government and the private
sector.
1.7         One of the maini reasons for the decline in the Maldivian labor force participation
rate, and for the growing reliance on expatriate labor, has been the inability of the Maldivian
education system to produce a sufficient numbiher of skilled workers. In 1992, only about 1,500
Maldivian nationals had educational qualifications at the seniior secondary level or above, while
only about 5,000 had vocational or other traininlg. By comparisoni, there are close to 20,000
skilled and semi-skilled individuals emlployed in Maldives. Thlis skill gap, of nearly 15,000
skilled and semi-skilled posts, has been filled by expatriate laborers. In the past, the policy of
nearly open-access to expatriate labor provided significant economzic benefits with very few social
costs. In the future, the nullmbers of school leavers are projected to increase quickly, to close to
5,000 persons per annumii (the mzajority of whom will he grade 7 leavers). resulting in the
possibility of rising national unemiiploymiienit and under-emiiploymiienit due to national skills not
matching the actual needs. Investment in secondary, post-secondary and vocational training is
needed to allow the country to develop a labor force able to close the skill gap efficiently, reverse
the stagnation in Maldivian labor force participation. and prevent the emler-genice of large numbers
of under-skilled Maldivian schlool leavers.



3
1.8        The low level of educational attainment of the national work force has also
contributed to the employment of under-qualified personnel in Government, where in the past, all
post-primary school leavers were bonded to serve. Past bonding and uncontrolled recruitment
practices contributed to an unnecessary swelling of the public sector and public sector enterprise
labor force from 10,000 persons in 1988 to nearly 18,000 in 1993. As a result of past and
present bonding practices, nearly 80 percent of all civil servants have only a primary or lower
secondary school education. Many of these individuals are untrained for the jobs they are
holding and cannot satisfy private sector skill demands. This combination of widespread public
sector over-staffing and a growing reliance on high-cost expatriates to staff skilled public sector
posts, together with mounting budget deficits, suggest that the opportunities for public sector
employment will be increasingly limited, and relatively less attractive in the future. This implies
that the quality of the education system needs to be improved so that its graduates can
successfully compete for jobs in the private sector. Government urgently needs to address the
bonding system, whereby all "0 and A level" school leavers (para. 1. 11) are allowed the option
of seeking either public or private employment and to provide career guidance for school leavers.
1.9        Major strides have already been made in improving the domestic education system.
Access to primary schools is nearly complete; the number of facilities offering lower secondary
and vocational training has increased; upper secondary education has been expanded and
improved; primary teacher training and curriculum programs have been developed; and
approximately 800 students have been sent on post-secondary fellowships overseas during the past
decade. Consequently, nearly all adults are literate in Dhivehi, practically all children attend
primary school, and the portion entering secondary school has increased by more than 50 percent
during the past five years.
1.10       The education system, however, will continue to face further strong demand for
access to primary, lower secondary and upper secondary schooling, resulting from the continuing
rapid growth in the school-age population and the policy mandate of providing universal primary
education and improved educational coverage at the secondary and post-secondary levels, where
participation is still relatively low. Between 1993 and 2000, the number of primary school
students is forecast to rise by about 30 percent, from 78,000 to over 90,000 (the actual impact
will be significantly reduced with the application of more stringent policies on repetition and
over-age enrollment). The number of children in the secondary age group will also continue to
rise during this same period, reaching about 10,000 by 2000.
B. Sector Background. Issues and Constraints
1.11       Education and Training System. Education in Maldives remains predominantly non-
government. In 1993, government schools accounted for some 45% of total enrollments;
although the proportion is increasing gradually as Government assumes greater responsibility for
schooling, particularly at the secondary level. The basic education system, which in 1990
comprised five years of primary education (following preschool called "kiyavaage") and two
years of middle school (grades 6 and 7), is fast becoming a primary system of seven years. It is
planned that by 2000, a seven-year primary cycle (grades I to 7) will be operating in all primary
schools enrolling almost the entire 6-12 age cohort. Basic education is followed by three years of
lower secondary (grades 8 to 10) and two years of upper secondary (grades 11 and 12). Annex 1



4
shows the structure of the education system and lists student enrollment by grade, sex and atoll.
The London University Certificate of Education "O level" examination is taken after grade 10
and the "A level" after grade 12. Post-secondary education is mainly pursued overseas for those
holding "O and A level" certificates. Some formal training does exist in Male' in the Vocational
Training Center (VTC) where semi-skilled and skilled craftsmen are trained, the Institute of
Health Sciences (IHS) where health assistants, family health workers and midwives are trained,
the Institute of Hotel and Catering Services which was established to serve the public and private
tourism industry and the Institute for Teacher Education (ITE) where primary pre- and in-service
teacher training programs are operating. Small Rural Youth Vocational Training Centers have
also been established in four atolls to train semi-skilled craftsmen.
1.12       To date, primary education has had a dual system - the traditional system of
community schools in the islands using Dhivehi as the medium of instruction and English-
medium primary schools introduced in 1960 and until recently restricted to Male'. There are six
such schools in Male'. Based on community impressions that children attending English-medium
schools have greater opportunities for secondary entry and on the availability of English teachers,
some communities have or are establishing English-medium programs. The traditional
community and parent committee controlled primary schools previously called "Makthabs" -
teaching the Qu'an - and "Madhrasas" - teaching the regular primary program - have been
integrated and now teach the new curriculum revised in 1984. The curriculum is being updated
progressively by the Education Development Center (EDC) comprises seven subjects: Islam,
Dhivehi, English, mathematics, environmental studies, practical arts and physical education.
Since the curriculum review, generally successful efforts have been made to make the textbooks
available to the schools. However, availability is still marginal in some of the distant schools.
1.13       A government Atoll Education Center (AEC) and an Atoll Primary School (APS)
have been established in the 19 larger atolls. These schools are fully funded by Government and
are staffed by trained teachers. Both types of schools cover the first seven years of basic
education. In the atolls, AECs provide some secondary places in grade 8 and a few have places
in grades 9 and 10. Annexes 1-B and C show the low enrollments in grades 8 to 10 in the atolls.
There is currently a high level of overage enrollment and repetition in primary schools. It is
estimated that, with the application of more stringent policies on enrollment and progression,
there would be ample capacity within the present system to accommodate a substantial amount of
the projected growth in grades I to 7 up to 2000.
1.14       Until the Southern Secondary School (SSS), built with IDA assistance, opened in
1992, there was no secondary school outside Male'. As shown in Annex 1-B, a limited number
of secondary places are available in AECs. In 1993, enrollments in grades 8 to 10 in Male'
accounted for 4,850 (78 percent) of secondary places, with 52 percent of the enrollments being in
non-government schools. As the medium of instruction in atoll primary grades is essentially
Dhivehi, it is difficult for grade 7 students to compete for limited places in secondary schools in
Male', where instruction in both the primary and secondary grades is in English. The lower
secondary curriculum follows the traditional arts and science streams, but in an attempt to adapt
the curriculum to economic needs, courses in commerce and fisheries science have been added.
Subjects in the lower secondary curriculum are shown in Annex 2. Upper secondary education
(grades 11 and 12) is offered at only one institution, the Science Education Center. It aims at



5
producing graduates qualified to enter higher education institutions overseas. The curriculum of
the upper secondary school comprises the core subjects of Dhivehi, English, mathematics and
Islamic studies and has two main streams - arts and science. The science stream accounts for
about 70% of the enrollments.
1.15       Since higher education programs are not offered in-country, it is the responsibility of
the National Scholarship Board (NSB) located in the Ministry of Planning, Human Resources and
Environment (MPHRE) to implement the National Scholarship Program (NSP). Based on the
lack of effective response from the bilateral scholarships awards, Government, with the assistance
of IDA funding, set up in 1988, a program to better respond to actual skill shortages. Each
Ministry surveyed its needs and prepared a priority list of skill shortages. The various priority
needs were consolidated by the NSB and, to ensure the most responsive allocation, were
implemented by a designated unit within the MPHRE. The mechanism for the selection and
management of scholarships has evolved and major efforts are being continued to ensure the most
effective response to national economic priorities. An indicator of the quality, relevance and
success of the fellowship program has been the number of returning fellows appointed to senior
decision making positions in Government. In 1994, six such fellows held positions as Ministers
or Directors of agencies and another 20 occupied senior technical posts. In addition to the
successful return of 100 percent of the trainees, all but one, due to a promotion, are working in
their fields of training, demonstrating the serious shortage of post-secondary graduates in the
country which in 1994 only numbered about 290.
1.16       Non-formal education operates as both a complementary and replacement system to
formal education activities. Examples of the replacement system are the basic and functional
literacy classes for adults who did not have an opportunity to attend primary education. This
program can give the candidates a primary equivalency in three years, thereby helping them to
qualify for employment and for participation in short-term training programs. The Non-Formal
Education Center (NFEC) within the Ministry of Education (MOE), coordinates the non-formal
activities. In addition to literacy programs, NFEC offers: (a) skill training programs such as
typing, Arabic, Thaana calligraphy, Thaana typing; (b) early childhood courses; (c) population
education focusing on higher primary and lower secondary schools; and (d) distance education
which focuses on English language training for atoll teachers and government officials (this
program is now running in thirteen atolls). NFEC also publishes a monthly newsletter on health,
nutrition, agriculture, handicrafts and other topics. Non-formal programs are also provided
through the VTC. Since 1975, the VTC has expanded its non-formal training activities to Rural
Youth Vocational Training Centers where it offers three month basic skill courses in carpentry,
small engine repair and some crafts. Four such centers have existed since 1982; however, their
use is estimated at less than 40% and the quality of instruction is not strong.
1.17       Education Quality. Teacher Training and Response to Needs. To keep pace with the
population growth, and to increase secondary enrollments, Government will need to continue to
expand its network of school facilities while at the same time increasing the number of trained
teachers. This will be difficult, both because of the high out-of-country cost of teacher training,
and the already existing shortage of trained teachers. As of June 1993, more than 800 expatriate
teachers were employed in the country. Even with the expatriates, however, the quality of
teaching has not been particularly good, as reflected by the low test results, the emergence of



6
open-unemployment amongst 0-level (grade 10) school leavers and the number of graduates that
require extensive vocational and English language retraining. To improve education quality, a
high priority should be attached to upgrading in-service and pre-service training programs for
primary school teachers and to establishing a training program for Maldivian lower secondary
school teachers.
1.18        The June 1993 teacher deployment study entitled "Report on Teacher Demand,
Supply and Training" reveals the following about primary teachers in the Maldives: (a) two-thirds
of the primary teachers are located in the atolls where 31 percent are untrained. The latter make
up about 94 percent of the total untrained primary teachers. About 96 percent of these teach
grades 1-5. Further, the majority of the 'trained' teachers have themselves only completed
primary school; (b) the atoll in-service teacher training program currently being piloted in the
south, is reported to be having a very positive impact and needs to be expanded; (c) a serious
shortage of teachers' guides exists, particularly in Dhivehi; (d) the demand for trained teachers to
replace untrained teachers and to meet the continuing expansion of primary education (about 6%
per annum) is not being met through the pre-service program at the ITE. The need is
accentuated by the expected full primary coverage of grades 1 to 7 by 2000. The newly built
facility at the ITE is inadequate even for existing enrollments and programs; (e) the transition
from the Dhivehi language medium used in the atolls to English, which is the medium at the
secondary level, is making the transition to secondary education very difficult for atoll students.
Strengthening of English language skills is necessary for the atoll teachers particularly those
teaching grades 6 and 7; and (f) Government pays 81 percent of all primary teacher salaries with
the remaining teachers being employed in non-government schools. With respect to secondary
teachers: (a) about 85 percent are located in Male' of whom 99 percent are trained and 75
percent are expatriates (many, however, with a poor mastery of both English and content); (b)
the cost of employment of expatriate teachers is about twice the cost of similarly trained nationals
and has become a serious drain on the national budget and governrnent foreign reserves; and (c)
one of the principal reasons advanced in the past for not training lower secondary teachers in-
country, that is, the lack of suitable candidates, has been negated now that sufficient numbers of
"A level" candidates (grade 12 leavers) are available (due to a 50 percent growth in their
numbers over the last five years). Maldives cannot afford to continue to pay for high cost
overseas secondary teacher training, and overseas scholarships are only available to train about
15 to 20 secondary teachers annually. It is estimated that an annual yearly minimum of 25
trained secondary teachers is required by the present system (due to attrition, expansion, etc.)
without taking into consideration the replacement of expatriates. Unless a national training
program is established, Maldives will have to continue to rely on expatriate teachers, salary costs
will continue to be beyond the country's means, and Government will not be able to respond
adequately to community pressures for increases in the number of secondary places.
1.19        As mentioned above, new primary teacher training facilities have been built at the
ITE. However, due to the lengthy planning stage2, these facilities are now less than adequate to
meet the existing primary pre- and in-service training needs. Some bilateral funds have been
2/ Planning started in 1986, but the facilities were not built until 1991/92. Construction was delayed as a result of a donor funding lag
with the Govemment having to cover the cost overruns. The result was the building of minimal facilities which are insufficient for the
needs.



7
received during the last five years, although shortages of facilities, library materials and teacher
resources still exist and negatively affect the quality of the ongoing programs. However, the
most crucial factor affecting the quality is the low level of qualification of the teacher trainers.
There is an urgent need to establish a staff development strategy to upgrade the qualifications of
the existing staff.
1.20       Most in-service programs are conducted at ITE in Male' along with the pre-service
programs, although a successful pilot teacher in-service program is now operating in the south on
Addu Atoll. The goals of the primary in-service activities are to give some basic training to
uncertified teachers, upgrade under-qualified primary teachers and assist schools with the
implementation of the curriculum. The trainers in the ITE program play a dual role as they also
assist the MOE by supervising education matters in the atolls. The in-service program has had a
positive impact on the quality of primary education but is also experiencing a shortage of staff
and of necessary resources. Continuation and expansion of the in-service teacher training
program, the only education quality input in the atolls, is needed. ITE in-service activities are
being supplemented by the NFEC through distance and radio training in basic English upgrading
courses available to atoll primary teachers.
1.21       At the secondary level, the high degree of dependence on costly expatriate teachers,
the rapid growth of the school age population and the increasing skill shortages in the domestic
labor force create an overwhelming demand for trained teachers. At this stage, the organization
of an in-country lower secondary teacher training program is a top priority. The development of
such a program has been constrained by the limited physical facilities at the ITE, the apparent
lack of qualified lecturing staff and past shortages of qualified candidates. Additional facilities,
teaching resources and staff will be required to support the introduction of a lower secondary in-
country teacher training program at ITE.
1.22       Secondary School Access. Access to secondary education is limited. Only about
one-third of the students who enroll in grade I proceed on to grade 8. Enrollments at the upper
primary grades 6 and 7 are increasing sharply, and it is expected that this growth in enrollments
will continue, based on a government policy to provide universal primary education through
grade 7 by 2000. In 1993, of the some 6,200 students attending lower secondary schools (grades
8 to 10), about 80 percent attended schools in Male'. The only designated lower secondary
school outside Male', the Southern Secondary School, is in Addu Atoll in the south and was built
with funds from the first IDA-funded Education and Training Project (Credit 1981-MAL). In
1993, the SSS enrolled one-third of the students in all atoll secondary grades outside Male', the
others being in lower secondary grades attached to primary schools. Secondary access is further
limited by the different language media used in the atoll primary schools and the secondary
schools. It is difficult for atoll students who have been taught in the Dhivehi medium for seven
years to transfer to English-medium secondary schools. Up until 1993, when the SSS began
offering a one-year English language and mathematics transition training program for grade 7
leavers before they entered grade 8, the primary students had to make a direct language switch
when entering secondary school. In addition to language issues, the distance students must travel
to go to school in Male' combined with the difficulties and high costs in finding suitable
accommodation there (if they have no relatives residing in Male'), results in many students being
unable to attend secondary school. The effect on female participation is noteworthy since female



8
enrollments in grade 6 and 7 are about 50 percent of the total and average 49 percent in grades 8
to 10 but are reduced to about 39 percent in the upper secondary grades. In addition, many
parents are still reluctant to send their girls to Male' and tend to retain them in the atolls. An
important feature of the SSS is that in its third year of operation, nearly 60 percent of its
enrollment is female. There is an urgent need to increase access to secondary schooling in the
atolls, both to reduce pressure on the Male' schools and to improve access to training
opportunities for students, particularly females. Finally, the free secondary education given in
the government schools favors students who have attended primary schools in Male', since they
have better competence in English which means that about 70 percent of the students who attend
the full fee-paying private schools in Male' are from the atolls, many from low income families.
The lower secondary places in AECs and APSs, which have resulted largely from community
pressures in the atolls, are constrained in scope, and with their limited facilities and resources,
are unable to provide quality lower secondary education in their present form. During
discussions with private sector representatives and tourist managers, the Bank Appraisal Mission
was told that students in such classes were not seen to be acquiring the necessary skills for
employment in their sectors and would be unlikely to be sought to fill vacancies. There is an
urgent need to increase access, equity of benefits and cost recovery measures within government
secondary schools to increase quality, particularly in the atolls, while allowing controlled private
sector expansion to continue.
1.23       Government is now proposing to increase lower secondary school access in the
northern part of the country in a new school, to be known as the Northern Regional Secondary
School (NRSS) which, like the SSS, will be designed to cater for a cluster of primary schools in
the immediate vicinity. The demography of the atolls constrains the extent to which it is
economic to establish quality secondary programs on most of the islands. Government has now
designated six additional islands with AECs, which have a sufficient number of potential students,
from their own and neighboring islands, to justify establishing lower secondary schools. These
expanded lower secondary atoll schools are to be known as secondary consolidated schools
(SCS). The SCSs will provide for two classes at each of grades 8 to 10, to be added to the
existing AECs. This initiative will enable the atoll students to receive a quality education, based
on the approved core curriculum and an appropriate allocation of qualified teachers. Further, the
enrollments will be such that economic staffing policies will be able to be applied. Donor
assistance will be required to support the effective introduction of consolidated schools. Because
Government has not mandated any clear expansion policies, many atoll primary schools3! have
opened lower secondary classes, usually with unsuitably qualified teachers and limited resources
and educational materials. Government now plans to redress the situation and implement its new
consolidated school policy which will allocate resources only to viable schools.
1.24       The Increasing Skill Gap. The demand for skilled and semi-skilled workers
continues to grow at a rapid pace, as evidenced by the number of skilled and semi-skilled
expatriates working in Maldives in 1993 (paras. 1.6 and 1.7). During the next decade, an
average of 1,500 to 2,000 Maldivians will complete grade 10 each year expecting to enter the
work force. Wlith limited possibilities for civil service employment, the great majority of the
31 Beyond some AECs which have a mandate to offer lower secondary grades.

school leavers will need to find employment in the private sector. The degree to which the
education system prepares students to have both basic and vocational skills assumes increasing
importance if the next generation of school-leavers is to find gainful employment.
1.25       The fact that nearly 8,000 expatriates hold semi-skilled positions in the economy
(waiter, cook, bookkeeper, plumber, carpenter, typist, etc.), suggests that there is scope for
Maldivian students to find employment if they have the appropriate skills. Domestic training
institutes currently provide vocational, nursing, teacher, management and hotel training.
However, these institutes tend to provide a highly academic curriculum, are poorly attuned to the
needs of the private sector, train only a small number of students, and operate on a non-
commercial basis. If increasing numbers of students are to be provided with the necessary
training, there will be a need to strengthen staff and improve facilities in these institutes.
1.26       One of the areas in which the private sector skill gap is most acute is in the field of
business management and commerce. Traditionally, the Maldives education system has provided
little training in modern business management methods. Lacking a trained cadre of national
workers, the private sector has relied primarily on expatriate workers to meet middle and senior
management skills gaps. A total of about 250 expatriate accountants, 75 auditors, 290 tour
guides, 50 receptionists, and 125 secretaries were employed in Maldives, as of November 1993.
The salaries and benefits provided to expatriate workers in these professions are relatively high.
This presents an opportunity for efficient import substitution in the labor market. Furthermore,
with anticipated growth in the tourism industry of 7 to 8 percent per annum, demand for
personnel with these skills will continue to rise at a rapid pace. With a relatively modest amount
of training, large numbers of Maldivian graduates and school leavers could become proficient in
these areas. Both to reduce the costs of private sector operations, and to target Maldivian
graduates towards areas of high employment demand, business management and administration
training should be provided through a combination of in-country and overseas training programs.
1.27       In 1991, the Maldives Center for Management and Administration (MCMA) was
established with UNDP assistance to upgrade the management skills of civil service mid- and
senior-level managers and to give basic skills to lower- and mid-level civil service staff. The
training courses and seminars have also recently been opened to trainees from the private sector.
To date, MCMA has run a limited number of courses and seminars in computers, office
management and senior management. As of December 1993, MCMA had trained about 870 in
short courses with a female participation rate of about 48 percent. However, the courses were
too few in number to have had a significant impact.
1.28       The original aim to train senior civil service managers has recently been partially
superseded by the return from overseas of many qualified degree-holding Maldivians, who have
been posted in senior civil service management positions. In addition, the few mid-level training
programs offered have been too theoretical, geared to high rather than mid-level workers, too
lengthy, not always taught at a suitable time (especially for trainees from the private sector) and
not tailored to the needs of the clients. Government has identified a strategy for reorienting
MCMA so that it is more responsive to private sector training requirements. The latter effort
would require the linking of course offerings to identified skill shortages (United Nations
International Development Organization report - July 1993) and increasing the frequency, timing



10
and suitability of such courses. The recent efforts by MCMA to include, in a limited way, fee-
paying private sector participants for accountancy training have been fairly successful.
1.29        Further issues include: (a) the limited training opportunities in-country in secretarial,
computer, accounting, business and management skills are resulting in many candidates being
forced to seek training abroad; (b) the low number of grade 10 leavers and of national trainers
remains but recent increases can now support lower cost in-country training programs; (c) there
is a lack of consultation between the MCMA and the private sector; and (d) MCMA underwent
considerable staff turnover in early 1994 during a period in which its mandate was changed to
become more oriented to meeting priority labor market needs.
1.30        Staff Development for Training Institutions. In addition to the MCMA, Government
has made and is continuing to make efforts to upgrade the training facilities for its health and
vocational training programs. A new well-equipped facility has been constructed for the IHS but
its effective utilization has been lower than expected. This low utilization has been partially
caused by difficulties in obtaining adequate numbers of trained staff. Bilateral and government
investments have been too focused on its physical and equipment aspects and not enough on staff
development. Without an improvement in staff qualifications, it will be difficult to improve the
quality and responsiveness of the IHS.
1.31        A similar situation exists at the VTC where the staff will require upgrading in order
to improve the quality of the existing programs and to enable them to keep up with developments
in technology. The VTC was unfortunately not included in the national scholarship program
funded under the first Education and Training Project, and the qualifications of its staff remain
very low. The VTC is now benefiting from bilateral assistance focused on its physical facilities
and equipment, leaving a need to upgrade its staff qualifications in order to provide the necessary
training to the trainees and to maximize the use of the large investments in hardware.
1.32        Tertiary Education Needs. Because of the high costs and small numbers of trainees,
Government logically runs very few in-country post-secondary training programs and relies
almost entirely on external training, usually offered through fellowship awards4/. Although
Government has made a concerted effort to marshall support for overseas fellowships and to
increase the number of Maldivians trained abroad, the skill gap, at the tertiary and graduate
levels, has continued to widen. As of November 1993, close to three-quarters of the highly
skilled positions in the country (approximately 3,300 posts) were filled by expatriates.
Government has utilized multi- and bi-lateral aid to send nearly 130 students on scholarships for
training abroad during the past four years. The majority of these students have been sent to
OECD nations, at a cost averaging US$25,000 per annum per student. The number of students
qualifying for further certificate/degree training now approaches 200 persons each year. To help
close the gap for highly skilled labor, Government will need to send far more students abroad for
tertiary training than in the past. A greater reliance on in-country training for lower secondary
teachers and on lower-cost regional training institutions, the introduction of partial cost-recovery
4/ The strateg) appears to have been much more successful and economical than the practice of establishing uneconomical and low quality
in-country institutions, as has been done by other small states (in the Pacific and Caribbean countries), since this strategy has responded to
skill shortages more rapidly and economically.



11
mechanisms, and careful prioritization of public sector training needs will be necessary to keep
costs down. Fellowship resources should also be made available to the private sector because of
the limited opportunities for labor absorption in the public sector and the relatively larger skill
gaps in the private sector.
1.33        Fellowship Program. In 1994, there were a total of about 590 Maldivian citizens
with diploma or certificate level qualifications, and 290 with university level training. Ninety
percent of these individuals were employed by the public sector. To meet the growing demand
for tertiary training, and to offset a decline in bilateral training assistance, the first Education and
Training Project supported about 90 overseas fellowships in a wide range of subjects and
disciplines. These fellowships were designed to train a cadre of public sector leaders, and in this
regard, it has exceeded expectations. In spite of this, however, the gap between the number of
highly skilled individuals necessary to operate a modern economy and those actually trained has
continued to widen. Skill shortages are most acute in professions such as accountant, attorney,
banker, computer scientist, doctor, electrician, engineer, teacher, machine operator, manager,
pharmacist, and surveyor. These shortages have been met so far, at a relatively high cost, by
employing expatriates (para. 1.26).
1.34        In Government, critical skill gaps and the many under-qualified individuals assigned
to positions of national responsibility continue to hamper productivity and reduce its effectiveness
in delivering critical services. In terms of fellowship training requirements in the public sector,
the main challenge will be to identify and train individuals to meet critical skill needs, and to
progressively upgrade and replace untrained public servants with suitably trained individuals.
1.35        However, the need for highly skilled individuals is far greater in the private than in
the public sector. By 1993, the private sector employed nearly 3,000 skilled and 8,000 semi-
skilled expatriate workers. The high cost and frequent turnover of expatriate workers reduces the
profitability of private sector activities and, in the long run, dampens competitiveness.
Nonetheless, the demand for skilled workers in the private sector is forecast to climb rapidly,
particularly in tourism and its ancillary services. Under the present bonding arrangements, all
students sent for fellowship training are required to work for Government although this policy is
applied flexibly. As a result, the private sector has difficulty recruiting and retaining trained
Maldivians. No scholarship or student loan arrangements are available to Maldivian students
who now work or plan to work in the private sector. Scholarship administration has been
consolidated under a high-level, multi-ministry, National Scholarship Board which reviews
training requests and assigns priorities. Since November 1993, a Scholarship Section (SS)
located within the MPHRE has been assigned to manage overseas training activities, to screen
candidates and to assist in monitoring and reviewing these activities. This represents a
considerable improvement over previous institutional arrangements.
1.36        Issues regarding fellowships include a need for: (a) NSB to increase private sector
participation and to augment the administrative resources provided to the SS, particularly in
accountancy and management; (b) fellowship opportunities to be provided for the private sector;
(c) a better match between the increased fellowship requests and national development priorities;
(d) allocation of fellowships on the basis of academic criteria; (e) the redirection of fellowship



12
allocations from primarily OECD nations to lower cost regional institutions; and (f) the
introduction of cost-recovery measures.
C. Education Financing
1.37       Education Expenditures. During the 1970s and 1980s, public sector financial
support to education was relatively modest, with almost all expenditures used to support the
development of a network of primary schools. In the early 1990s, with nearly universal primary
education, the focus of education shifted towards secondary and post-secondary training, resulting
in a rapid growth in overall spending. From 1988 to 1990, the education sector accounted for 15
percent of Government's total recurrent spending and had increased to 18 percent by 1993/94.
This growth in spending reflects: (a) the increasing number of students in government, as
opposed to private, schools; (b) the changing emphasis in the education system towards higher
unit-cost lower secondary, upper secondary, tertiary and vocational training; (c) the need to
employ increasing numbers of expatriate teachers to staff the education system; and (d) the
assumption by Government of responsibility for the recurrent cost of several schools that had
previously been staffed and financed by the private sector.
1.38       Capital spending in education has been volatile, reflecting the influence of uneven
donor-assisted investments in the sector. On average, capital spending has ranged between 10 to
15 percent of total public sector capital expenditures and net-lending. Total education sector
expenditure in 1993, was equivalent to 18 percent of total public expenditures, compared to 10
percent of total public expenditures in 1988. The rapid growth in recurrent public expenditures
for education is of particular concern, in part because of the budget deficit, and in part because
of the limited post-primary educational coverage and the low level of training quality despite the
allocation of a substantial portion of total public expenditures to education (Table 1.1).

1.39      Capital spending in the education sector is often done in partnership with the private
sector and local communities. Recent investments focused on expanding the capacity of atoll
primary schools and for secondary education. Recent investment in skill training, in the areas of
health, vocational and teacher training programs, have been almost totally financed by
Government. In 1993, about 13.5 percent of the total public investment in education was for
primary schools. Public investment in secondary and post-secondary education generates far
higher recurrent expenditure requirements for Government than does primary education because
of the more costly teacher, material and facility requirements. Other than IDA support for the
SSS, Government has financed most of the other capital expenditures in the education sector from
its own budgetary resources. Efforts to mobilize other sources of donor assistance for education
sector capital investment should be increased. According to MOE, in 1993, capital spending in
education included: primary - Rf 7.9 million, lower secondary - Rf 14.7 million, upper secondary
- Rf 2.8 million, MOE administration - Rf 7.0 million, and fellowships, vocational and other - Rf
26.4 million for a total of Rf 58.8 million.
1.40      Table 1.2 below presents a breakdown of MOE recurrent costs for the year 1993.
Out of total recurrent spending of Rf 164 million, 46 percent was allocated to primary education,
15 percent to secondary, 4 percent to vocational and continuing education and 16 percent to MOE
administrative charges. A total of Rf 74 million, or about 45 percent of the total recurrent
budget was allocated to pay the salaries and benefits of expatriate teachers, each individually
costing about twice as much as for an equivalent Maldivian teacher. There are disparities in unit
cost per pupil between atoll and Male' schools. Disaggregated data on unit cost by level of
education is unavailable. However, on average, US$ 250 was spent per pupil in Male' and about
US$ 160 in the atolls. In 1993, the average recurrent cost per student in the Male' upper
secondary school (Science Education Center) was US$880 per year.

1.41       Data Base Development. The data base from which information on education
expenditures is drawn is both fragmentary and incomplete. There are variations of close to 25
percent between budgetary reports produced by the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT)
and those of the MOE. The financial reports that are made are presented in a form that does not
allow a clear identification of spending to different categories of educational service. From a
budget-management vantage point, there would be considerable benefit in establishing a suitable
financial data reporting system, and compiling, automating and publishing an annual set of
detailed, education sector financing statistics. Such statistics should include both capital and
recurrent expenditures, together with spending by all institutions providing education services.
These statistics, together with information on educational access and quality, would provide a
foundation for budget preparation and capital investment planning.
1.42       Cost Recovery and Private Sector Participation in Education. The Maldivian
education system has a high degree of overall private participation and cost recovery. In the
atolls, 33,000 out of 55,000 students attend community and private schools in which Government
pays teachers about 80 percent of their salaries while the community meets all other costs. In
Male', approximately 50 percent of the lower secondary students attend private secondary
schools, in which most teacher salaries and all other costs are privately financed. In all schools,
students are obliged to purchase their own textbooks and school materials. For primary school
students, the average annual cost of textbooks and materials is about Rf 300 per student. For
secondary school students, the average annual cost of textbooks is about Rf 1,450 per student.
1.43       Besides the cost of purchasing books and school supplies, no other fees are charged
for government primary, secondary, post-secondary or fellowship training. This results in
considerable inequities in the allocation of education sector finances because the majority of post-



15
primary education places are concentrated in Male'. Secondary coverage accounts for less than
10 percent of all school enrollments. As a result, large numbers of students remain in primary
school as long as possible which allows them to compete for a place in lower secondary school.
Based on current enrollment capacity, of every 100 students who enter grade 1, about 11 will
complete grade 10 and only 1.5 are expected to reach grade 12, due largely to a lack of student
places. Only about 20 percent of grade 7 primary school completers reach grade 10 with the
marked decrease again being largely the result of insufficient secondary places. As grade 7
continues to grow (due to Government's policy on universal primary education), the percentage
of students able to proceed beyond grade 7 could be halved by around 2000 (even with a
reasonable growth in grades 8 to 10 of around 150 student places per year). The introduction of
cost-recovery measures in Male's privileged schools would lower the fiscal burden on the
education system and allow further focus on secondary quality particularly in the atolls where 70
percent of the population resides.
1.44       Opportunities for Expenditure Rationalization. The cost-effectiveness of education
sector investments is a source of concern due to: (a) low student:teacher ratios throughout the
system, but particularly at the vocational, continuing education and secondary school levels; (b)
recurrent costs for the new SSS of about US$800 per pupil 5/; (c) tertiary training fellowship
costs averaging more than US$50,000 total per recipient, most of which are undertaken in OECD
countries with no method of cost recovery, (d) differences of more than 100 percent in the per-
student allocation of recurrent financing within government primary and lower secondary schools
because of the lack of transparent and equitable rules for allocating recurrent expenditures to
these institutions, together with limited monitoring of how subsidies are used; (e) the high share
of total recurrent expenditures allocated to MOE administrative costs; and (f) inclusion of
numerous non-education sector expenditures in the budget of the MOE (e.g. Independence Day
Celebration costs). All the above are signs of weak budgetary control and limited accountability
in education and training outlays. As a first step towards tightening financial control, there is a
need to establish and track internal and external education efficiency indicators.
1.45       Administrative issues affecting educational financing include: (a) educational
activities are now funded by at least three ministries and the President's Office and should be
consolidated within the MOE. This situation exacerbates the practice of unequal recurrent cost
financing to different institutions, as mentioned above; (b) there is a lack of effective financial
management within MOE, in the atolls and at the school level. It is critical that the system's
ability to better manage its financial resources be enhanced so it can engage in better planning
and use its limited resources more effectively; and (c) in order to reduce the fiscal burden,
various approaches for secondary education cost recovery need to be assessed and the scope and
mechanisms for such cost recovery finalized.
D. Environmental Considerations
1.46       The fragile ecology of an atoll-based nation demands a heightened sensitivity to the
environmental consequences of development efforts and greater efforts to diversify employment

away from atoll-based tourism and fisheries. The Government of Maldives has been at the
forefront of preservation and conservation efforts by the small island states. On the domestic
front, Government has attempted to integrate environmental considerations into all spheres of
economic activity. A National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) was completed in 1989,
approved in 1990 and updated in 1993. The NEAP identified environmental priorities and
established a set of projects and programs to address key concerns. Thereafter, the National
Development Plan for 1990-1993 defined a framework in which environmental issues were set in
the context of the nation's overall development strategy. The Maldives' National Report to the
United Nations Conference on Environment and Development provides an institutional strategy
for implementing environmental measures outlined in the NEAP and the National Development
Plan. In 1992, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) initiated a two-year technical assistance
program to strengthen environmental management capacity throughout Government.
1.47       The MOE has played an important role in improving the understanding and
awareness of environmental issues in Maldives. A special curriculum has been developed for
environmental issues and has been successfully launched throughout the nation's primary schools.
Science textbooks for the secondary schools have recently been revised, with ample references to
the biophysical environment of Maldives. Under the first Education and Training Project, the
four senior officers of the environmental unit of the MPHRE were provided with overseas
training in environmental science. These individuals now form the core of the environmental unit
in the MPHRE. Fellowship training in environmental topics was also provided to planners in
other branches of Government.
1.48       In April 1993, Government passed the Environmental Protection and Preservation
Act of Maldives. This Act sets forth regulations concerning environmental protection, waste
disposal, treatment of hazardous and toxic wastes, and conditions under which an Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) would be required for new projects. Draft guidelines for the
preparation of EIA's have been issued by MPHRE's environmental unit. In the case of projects
with a relatively modest impact on the environment, such as the physical construction activities
under the proposed Project, the environmental unit may deem it unnecessary to prepare an EIA,
substituting instead an Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE). The IEE consists of a brief
assessment of the significant biophysical and social impacts of the proposed project on the natural
and human environment. Staff of the environment unit indicated in discussions that for the type
of investments under consideration for the proposed Project, an IEE should be sufficient to obtain
project clearance on environmental grounds.
1.49       Coral for Construction Purposes. A Presidential Decree forbids the use of coral for
construction of government buildings in Male'. Coral mining, however, is a traditional source of
income in many atolls, and in certain areas coral is commonly used for residential and other
forms of construction. In recognition of the irreversible damage done to fragile reef eco-zones
by coral ininiig, Government has generally banned the use of coral for construction of large
governmenit projects, both in and outside Male', including school construction.

E. Government Policies and Plans
1.50       Government's policies and plans for education and training up to 1995 are described
in the "Education and Human Resources Development Plan, 1985-1995", the "Education Sector
Review" dated February 1991, the "Report on Teacher Demand, Supply and Training" dated
June 1993, and the "National Development Plan, 1994-1996" dated March 1994. The plans
contain clear and consistent analyses of the issues and constraints. Major objectives are to
provide universal primary education by 2000, make education more relevant to local needs and
reduce serious skill gaps. Government is well aware that manpower deficits can, if not managed
properly, turn into surpluses, especially in the non-technical categories. Government also plans
to increase secondary enrollment and to reduce disparities in educational opportunities.
Establishment of the SSS was the first step in this direction. In view of the delicate geo-structure
of Maldives, environmental education will be included at all levels. To improve the quality of
basic education, teacher training will be strengthened. To reduce the reliance on high cost
expatriate teachers, an in-country lower secondary level teacher training program will be
introduced. Based on the positive impact of the fellowship program undertaken under the first
Project, a similar program would follow, with increased coordination with bilateral donors and
greater emphasis on regional placements. Finally, as a start towards improving the financial
sustainability of the education sector, Government is prepared to assess the scope and
mechanisms for cost recovery at the secondary level and to introduce cost recovery measures for
vocational and skill training activities and for fellowship recipients. It also plans to strengthen
financial management in the education system and develop, with the assistance of the Asian
Development Bank, an education master plan.
F. Previous IDA Lending and Lessons Learned
1.51       The first IDA involvement in the sector, the ongoing Education and Training Project
(Credit 1981-MAL for US$8.19 million), has been very well implemented. All project objectives
are being met or exceeded, and disbursements are meeting appraisal estimates. Other IDA-
funded operations in the country included a Fisheries Project (Credit 907-MAL) which closed in
1983 after meeting its objectives. The Second Fisheries Project (Credit 1329-MAL), the Third
Fisheries Project (Credit 2327-MAL) and the Airport Project (Credit 2143-MAL), other than
recruitment and training problems, are being implemented satisfactorily. The main lesson learned
from the ongoing Project is that the SSS located in an atoll, greatly increased equitable access for
females, because proximity to schools is an important consideration. The Project also resulted in
the largest infusion of nationally qualified secondary teachers of the past ten years (compared to
the previous reliance on bilateral fellowships). The fellowship program contributed to one of the
most substantial skill shortage reductions, for senior government officials, evidenced in a small
state. Government has systematically followed the recommendations of the project-related studies.
The operation of the inter-ministerial committee overseeing the Project was efficient and able
staff were assigned to manage the Project. In addition, the various studies identified the need to:
(a) improve the quality of primary education by upgrading the primary teacher training programs;
(b) develop more equitable and quality-based education policies; (c) develop urgently a national
strategy to increase the supply of lower secondary teachers; (d) improve equitable access, quality
and cost recovery measures in secondary education; (e) make use of lower-cost fellowships in
the Asia region and of in-country training programs (especially in management and business) to



18
meet post-secondary skill shortages; and (f) consolidate and rationalize the budgetary processes
and base the allocation of resources in the sector on priority needs. There is also a need for
Government to establish a national post-secondary scholarship funding mechanism for long-term
training needs. Also worth noting is the fact that Government has demonstrated its capacity to
implement projects, within the scheduled time and budget.
G. IDA Strategy and Rationale for Involvement
1.52       Based on the positive policy dialogue experienced during the ongoing Project, the
Government wishes to have IDA continue that role. The main reason for IDA involvement is
that IDA can best help the Government to undertake policy measures other donors are reluctant
to address. The Bank is the largest donor to the country and it appears to have, at this stage, the
most suitably qualified staff to deal with the human resources sector issues. Within the difficult
economic situation faced by the country, support for the education remains a priority. The
proposed Project sets a policy-based framework for a structured approach and for rationalizing
the further development of human resources. That policy framework is outlined in a Government
letter and policy matrix (Annex 3). The proposed credit is fully consistent with the country
policies and the Country Assistance Strategy.

II. THE PROJECT
A. Origin of the Project
2.1        Possible IDA assistance to strengthen the quality of basic education, to improve
access to secondary education and to increase skill training opportunities have been under
discussion between the Government and IDA since 1989. During that period, a donor and IDA-
funded education sector review was undertaken as were studies on school curriculum
development, labor market/skill analysis and teacher needs (para. 1.51). Based on the
conclusions of these studies,. the proposed Project takes a different approach from the first
Project. The project components are based on policy recommendations to be applied during
project implementation. The main policy areas include:
(a)   establishing clearer teacher recruitment, deployment and work load policies to
increase the economic responsiveness and cost effectiveness of teacher training
programs;
(b)  targeting education access in the atolls;
(c)  limiting atoll secondary education expansion to viable schools. Such expansion
would also focus on quality improvements and further opportunities for females;
(d)   continuing the flexible administrative procedures for the bonding of secondary and
vocational school leavers which allow graduates to work in either the private or
public sectors;
(e)   organizing in-country mid-level skill training programs to reduce skill gaps, and
making these accessible to both public and private sector fee-paying trainees;
(f)   supporting a priority-based allocation of fellowships to better match economic needs,
and allowing the selection of the best candidates from either the public or private
sectors with 80 percent of the allocation to be spent in lower cost regional training
institutions;
(g)  implementing cost recovery measures at the secondary and vocational levels and for
tertiary fellowships; and
(h)   consolidating the MOE budget to establish more equitable allocations of resources to
schools and atolls, while introducing monitoring and cost recovery mechanisms to
maximize the use of the limited resources available for education and training
activities.
B. Project Obiectives and Scope
2.2         The Project would support policy-based investments in basic education and skills
development to: (a) improve primary and secondary education quality, targeting opportunities for
the poor; (b) reduce the shortage of teachers at the primary and secondary levels focusing on the
atolls' teacher needs; (c) upgrade atoll primary teachers (80 percent women); (d) make secondary
education more widely available in the atolls where 70 percent of the population lives and where
less than 20 percent of the access exist. Also, to focus on increasing female participation and, by
developing the scope and mechanisms for cost recovery in government schools, to support
improvements in education quality; (e) reduce skill shortages by increasing the suitability of



20
national skill training programs and making these more sustainable; (f) upgrade staff at the
health, vocational, management and teacher training institutions; (g) increase the economic
responsiveness of, and access to, post-secondary fellowship training opportunities by allocating
training to both public and private sector recipients mainly in lower cost regional institutions, by
supporting graduate employment in the private sector and by introducing fellowship cost recovery
measures; and (h) strengthen financial management of the education sector.
C. Project Description
2.3        Specifically the Project would:
(a)   upgrade education quality by establishing an in-country lower secondary teacher
training program to meet immediate needs and the long-term goal of gradually
reducing the number of expatriate teachers; strengthening the pre-service teacher
training program and increasing the availability of teachers' learning materials;
upgrading primary atoll teachers through in-service training; remodelling facilities
for the Institute for Teacher Education; and by establishing efficiency indicators in
order to monitor and manage the education system;
(b)  increase equitable access to quality secondary education for about 1,400 additional
students in the atolls by adding lower secondary grades 8-10 to four selected AECs
and establishing a new lower secondary school in the north; maintaining a career
information and guidance program; and undertaking policy reforms in secondary
education including consolidating atoll secondary education, recovering costs at the
secondary level in government schools, continuing the flexible administration of the
bonding of secondary school leavers and assisting with the implementation of more
economical and equitable student:teacher ratios and staff deployment policies;
(c)  reduce skill shortages by developing at the Maldives Center for Management and
Administration, fee-paying modular courses that would respond to both private and
public sectors; improving the quality of existing and new skill training programs at
the MCMA, ITE, IHS and VTC through staff training programs; and providing
facilities at MCMA and equipment and books at MCMA and VTC;
(d)  increase the responsiveness to economic priorities for overseas post-secondary
training by selecting the best candidates under a criteria-based fellowship program.
The program would allocate about 25 percent of the fellowships to the private sector
with about 80 percent of all fellowships offered at lower cost regional institutions.
Sustainability would be supported by the introduction of cost recovery measures for
the establishment of an ongoing fellowship program. The hiring into the public
sector would be on a needs basis and graduates would be allowed to select
employment in either the public or private sectors;
(e)  strengthen financial management of the education sector by improving financial
practices and mechanisms to provide more equitable grants and financial support to
educational institutions; and



21
(f)   undertake prioritv studies in the education sector.
Teacher Education Program (estimated baseline cost US$2.7 million).
2.4        The goal of the teacher education component is to improve education quality at both
the primary and secondary levels by: (a) establishment of an in-country pre-service training
program for lower secondary teachers; (b) revision of existing primary pre-service teacher
training programs and development and supply of teaching/learning materials for use in primary
pre- and in-service courses; (c) expansion of regionally-based primary in-service activities;
(d) implementation of a staff development program for primary teacher education lecturers; and
(e) upgrading of teacher education facilities, equipment and library resources. The teacher
education component project inputs are described below.
2.5        Lower Secondary Pre-service Teacher Training Program. The Project would
support the establishment of an in-country lower secondary pre-service teacher training program
at ITE. The initial training period for teachers would be two years, preceded by a three-month
intensive English language course. The total planned output by the end of the Project in 1999,
would be 100. The intake would increase gradually from some 32 in 1996 to 50 by 2001, and
then stabilize, giving a total number of graduates from the program of around 430, by 2006.
Allowing for an attrition rate of 5 percent, the number of national teachers trained through the
program would approximate the current total supply of secondary teachers. This level of
enrollment in the training program is considered necessary to meet the growing demand for
secondary teachers, particularly in the atolls. Annex 4 provides details of projected teacher
demand, teacher training enrollments and cost savings to be derived from the employment of
local rather than expatriate teachers. The cost benefit is high and supports the introduction of an
in-country lower secondary teacher training program.
2.6        ITE would be assisted in the development and implementation of the program by an
overseas link institution (LI). The LI would assist in the overall design of the program (course
development/adaptation), the training of the program's lecturers and the implementation of the
program. Project support would include: (a) technical assistance (TA) from the LI (22 staff-
months in-country and 18 staff-months at the LI) for the development of a two-year program and
associated courses and materials; (b) five to eight attachments at the LI for newly appointed
secondary lecturers (42 staff-months). If necessary, up to three fellowships would also be
available to newly selected staff members to enable all eight lecturers to have the necessary
qualifications for teaching the secondary teacher training courses; (c) a study visit by a senior
ITE staff member, arranged through the LI (2 staff-months); (d) four overseas fellowships for
existing primary teacher training lecturing staff who would be able to contribute to both the
primary and the secondary programs (84 staff-months); (e) materials for course development at
the LI; and (f) local TA to prepare materials, as required, in-country (12 staff-months). These
inputs would be supported by an AIDAB grant (para. 3.6). Annex 4 provides the proposed
implementation plan.
2.7        Provision would be made for monitoring the program. During the mid-term review,
the program design would be evaluated in-country by overseas consultants (including



22
representatives from selected regional institutions) and the review would be followed up by
project financed workshops and a conference on teacher education.
2.8         It is recognized that, based on the proposed secondary expansion over the next few
years, it will be necessary to continue to employ substantial numbers of expatriate teachers,
particularly for more senior grades and in areas not covered in the ITE lower secondary
program. It is also recognized that following a period of teaching, further training for at least
some ITE graduates will be necessary before they would be qualified to teach higher grades.
2.9         Primary Pre-service Teacher Education Program and Education Materials. The main
goals of this sub-component would be to: (a) revise the present program following a review of
the subjects and syllabuses currently being offered in order to integrate content and methodology
and cover satisfactorily the professional needs of teachers in grades 1 to 7; and (b) produce
education materials. Curriculum revision would be undertaken through workshops by subject
panels comprising teacher educators and resource persons. Two staff months of short-term TA
over two visits, preferably from the LI, would be financed to undertake this work. The Project
would also support the printing of draft copies of the revised curriculum for wider discussion.
2.10        The pre-service courses, especially for Dhivehi medium primary teachers, are
suffering from an acute shortage of teaching/learning materials in the Dhivehi language. The
paucity of materials restricts access to resources and limits the scope of assignments and self-
study which can be undertaken in the pre-service courses. In-service activities and follow-up by
teachers are similarly constrained by the lack of materials. In addition, in some subject areas,
there are few or no Maldivian-based materials in Dhivehi, and translation of materials is slow
and costly. The Project would provide 24 staff-months of local TA to develop and translate
relevant materials into Dhivehi. Printing of materials would also be undertaken under the
Project. Materials development would be approached through both workshops and independent
work. The baseline cost for the primary pre-service activities is estimated at US$190,000.
2.11        In-service Teacher Training. The major focus in this sub-component would be on
the further development of the regional in-service teacher training program to: (a) train untrained
teachers in the atolls; and (b) provide on-going staff development for all primary teachers,
particularly those in atoll schools. The in-service programs would be designed for atoll teachers
and would be delivered by atoll-based ITE lecturers although some of the longer courses, geared
to national priorities, would be conducted in Male'. The regional in-service program in the south
has the potential to provide a systematic series of courses which could facilitate the accumulation
of credits by the participants. Further, there is scope to link distance education courses, offered
through the NFEC, with upgrading programs, particularly for untrained teachers who may not
possess the level of education required to enter formal training. Facilities, resources and
equipment would be needed at three locations - Male', Seenu (in the south) and Kulhudhuffushi
(in the north).
2.12        The Project would support the in-service initiatives through: (a) construction of a
facility at the AEC in Seenu; (b) addition of a facility to the NRSS (to be funded by IDB - para.
2.22); (c) supply of equipment and educational materials for the three centers; (d) support for
local TA to prepare materials for regional courses; and (e) contributing to the operational costs of



23
each of the centers during the project implementation period. The baseline cost for the in-service
activities is estimated at US$230,000.
2.13        Primary Staff Development. At the beginning of 1994, ITE had an academic staff of
36, comprising 30 nationals and 6 expatriates. Only 6 of the 30 nationals hold university degrees
although nearly all have received short teacher education courses overseas. Of the total, one
national, three expatriates and three national "trainee" lecturers are stationed full-time in three
atolls to conduct the current primary in-service programs. In addition to full-time staff, ITE
makes considerable use of about 30 resource persons and part-time lecturers living in Male'.
The Project would support: (a) a program of staff upgrading through a combination of overseas
fellowships and distance education for a total of 110 staff-months with about 60 percent expected
to be undertaken at regional institutions. In addition, the AIDAB grant for secondary teacher
training would support (b) four distance mode fellowships, through the LI for existing staff,
including some provision for short overseas visits (80 staff-months); and (c) three short-term
attachments in educational management for program coordinators (8 staff-months). The baseline
cost for the combined staff development activities is estimated at US$260,000.
2.14        Facilities. Equipment and Library Resources. Provision would also be made within
the Project for: (a) modification of physical facilities at the present ITE campus to accommodate
the new secondary teacher training program and construction of a small adjacent building to
accommodate both pre- and in-service teacher education needs; (b) supply of academic and office
furniture and equipment; (c) supply of library resources for the secondary program, together with
some additional general and primary materials to add to the existing collection; and (d) printing
of locally developed teaching learning materials. It is estimated that the facility refurbishing at
ITE, construction of the new building and the purchase of equipment and furniture would cost
about US$600,000. During negotiations, Government provided IDA with ITE facilities designs
and draft bidding documentation.
2.15        Policies. Particular attention would need to be given during the Project to
deployment policies to maximize the effectiveness of trained teachers. As the cadre of trained
teachers increases, attention will also need to be given to class size and to multi-grade teaching.
Further, student repetition practices will need to be monitored to ensure that the level of growth
required to implement the Government's policy of education for all to grade 7 by 2000, can be
realized without undue demand on the nation's resources. Available data suggest that a
combination of over-age enrollment and repetition impacts markedly on enrollment figures as
reflected in the primary school coverage rate which is estimated at 133% of the recognized
primary age group (6 to 12 years). The overall increase in opportunities for access to primary
school, combined with the implementation of a policy on automatic progression, should serve to
reduce the coverage rate, over time. Also, the availability of additional secondary places will
assist in reducing the repetition rate. MOE is reviewing progression policies for implementation
during the Project.
2.16       Therefore, teacher related policies that will be pursued during the Project include:
(a) establishing stronger recruitment, deployment and work load policies for teachers;
(b) improving cost-efficiency by increasing, where possible, the student:teacher ratios, to at least
a 30:1 ratio for primary, particularly in Male', and 25:1 for secondary by the end the Project;



24
(c) decreasing repetition rates in primary grades to give an overall reduction in the rate of I to 2
percent per year; (d) developing cross-creditation between the in-service and pre-service teacher
training programs to allow atoll primary teachers to use the credits they have earned in-service
towards future pre-service programs; (e) reducing the number of unqualified primary teachers by
at least 1 percent per year; and (f) developing teacher monitoring procedures and key indicators
to assess the impact of the various teacher training programs.
2.17        During negotiations, Government provided assurances that it would:
(a)   By March 31, 1996, and by March 31 of each year thereafter, complete a teacher
demand and supply analysis, in accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to
the Association, and thereafter take all actions satisfactory to the Association to
address teacher needs [para. 5.2 (a)]; and
(b)   By January 31, 1996, complete a recruitment strategy satisfactory to the Association
for primary and secondary school teachers [para. 5.2 (b)].
Secondary Education Access Program (estimated baseline cost US$5.6 million).
2.18        The goal of this component is to: (a) increase access to lower secondary education in
the atolls; (b) improve the quality of education through the upgrading of facilities and the
provision of a sound education program of studies; (c) increase opportunities for female
participation in quality secondary education in their own atolls; (d) equip atoll students to be
more competitive in gaining access to grades 11 and 12 in Male'; and (e) develop skills and
knowledge which will allow students who complete grade 10 to enter vocational fields,
particularly in health areas.
2.19        While the atolls have 75 percent of the national population, only 22 percent of grade
8 to 10 places are located in atoll schools. There is currently an acute shortage of grade 10
leavers for entry into vocational and skill training programs. This shortage is particularly marked
in VTC and IHS, which have to rely on grade 7 leavers (who are unable to cope with the
programs) to fill vacancies which are not sought by students from Male' schools. The
distribution of grades 8 to 10 enrollment by sex and atoll, including Male' is shown in Annex 1-
B.
2.20        Facilities for lower secondary education in the atolls are minimal. Apart from the
SSS, which was built under the first Project, there are no other dedicated facilities for lower
secondary classes. To-date classes have been added to AECs and to APSs in an ad hoc manner.
AECs are located in the more densely populated and more accessible areas within atolls (enabling
some students from neighboring islands to be enrolled). They provide the most appropriate
locations for expansion and consolidation of resources. However, as the facilities in these
schools are limited (primary classes at the AECs already operate on a shift basis) and
inappropriate for secondary education, the scope for quality secondary education is limited. This
component includes two sub-components designed to increase access to quality lower secondary
education in the atolls.



25
2.21       The first sub-component involves the development of lower secondary consolidated
schools with two parallel classses at selected larger AECs. Schools with parallel classes and
about 8 to 9 teachers give suitable curriculum coverage and result in more cost effective units
than single class schools and allow greater parental participation. Parallel classes are possible
when 160 to 220 students are enrolled in grades 8 to 10. MOE has designated 6 AECs for
priority development. Each of the schools has a current primary enrollment large enough to
yield parallel classes in grades 8 to 10. The designated schools are: Shaviyani, Lhaviyani and
Baa, north of Male', and Gaaf Alif, Gaafu Dhaalu and Gnaviyani, south of Male'. During 1994,
Government has begun a program to add a limited number of additional classrooms to these
schools to provide some relief. The design of these facilities, with minor modifications, is
suitable for the proposed expansion and upgrading of facilities under the Project.
2.22       The second sub-component involves the establishment of a new lower secondary
"cluster" school in the north, to be known as the Northern Regional Secondary School. The
NRSS will be designed to cater for around 450 students in grades 8 to 10, similar to the SSS.
Government has selected a suitable site for the school at Kulhudhuffushi (with a population of
about 6,000) on Haa Dhaal Atoll. It is expected that the school will also serve the neighboring
Haa Alif, Shaviyani, Noonu and part of Raa atolls (with an additional population of about 6,000).
Over 700 students are currently enrolled in grade 7 in potential feeder primary schools in these
atolls. Two-thirds of these students are in government AECs or APSs. These schools already
have a small number of students enrolled in grade 8. IDB has agreed to fund the capital
development of the school, at an estimated total cost of US$2.3 million.
2.23       An "O level" curriculum will be followed, to be taught in English. Consistent with
the initiative taken at SSS, an initial transition year will be included to provide remedial work for
students who have attended Dhivehi-medium primary schools and have limited proficiency in
English and mathematics. The Project would not provide funding for student or teacher
accommodation. As with the SSS, accommodation for students from the other atolls and for
teachers will be available in the local community.
2.24       Given the limited number of trained and experienced Maldivian secondary teachers,
it will be necessary to continue to recruit some expatriate staff with degrees, diplomas or
equivalent in the schools first few years, while Maldivians are being trained. As there are
currently a number of secondary teachers in the four selected AECs, the total number of
additional staff required for the NRSS (18 teachers) and SCSs (6 teachers) will be about 25. The
proposed in-country lower secondary teacher training program (para. 2.5) is being planned to
yield national teachers from 1998.
2.25       For the SCSs, the Project would support: (a) the upgrading and/or expansion of
facilities (classrooms, science laboratories, libraries, staffrooms, "assembly halls", latrines and
other areas, depending on the state of the present provisions) in four AECs - Lhaviyani, Baa,
Gaafu Dhaalu and Gnaviyani; (b) the provision of furniture, as required; and (c) the purchase of
teaching and learning materials and library books. The estimated baseline cost for the set of four
schools is US$2.3 million. During negotiations, Government provided IDA with SCS designs
and draft bidding documentation. For the NRSS, the Project would support: (a) civil works,
including site works; (b) furniture and equipment; (c) library and teaching/learning resource



26
materials; and (d) 50 staff-years of overseas fellowships to train Maldivians teachers to
diploma/degree levels, about 60 percent of which are expected to be undertaken at regional
institutions. Civil works and furniture for the NRSS would be funded by IDB (para. 3.6), with
equipment, library and resource materials and fellowships being funded by IDA.
2.26       The Project would also support the maintenance of a career information and
guidance program that would compile and disseminate information on career and training choices
to secondary school students. The production of guidance materials and travel by career
information and guidance program staff would be financed under the Project (Annex 6). During
negotiations, Government provided assurances that it would maintain a career information and
guidance program satisfactory to the Association [para. 5.2 (c)].
2.27       Policies. In order to improve the efficiency of the secondary system, Government
has agreed to undertake the following policy reforms: (a) pursuing the development of SCSs only
in those atolls/islands which have sufficient students to support the establishment of parallel
classes in grades 8 to 10; (b) teacher deployment--following a review of current staffing levels,
achieving a secondary student/teacher ratio of at least 20:1 with a longer-term target of a
minimum of 25:1 by the end of the Project (para. 2.16); (c) cost recovery--finalizing the scope
and mechanisms for the implementation of recovery of costs in secondary schools; and
(d) student bonding--continuing the flexible application of the bonding regulations, utilized since
1991, which allow school leavers/graduates to move into further training or seek employment in
either the public or private sectors. To assist students to identify career and continuing education
opportunities, career guidance in secondary schools would be improved.
2.28       During negotiations, Government provided assurances that it would:
(a)   by January 31, 1996, commence to implement a secondary school consolidation
expansion policy satisfactory to the Association [para. 5.2 (d)]; and
(b)   by January 31, 1997 finalize the scope and mechanisms satisfactory to the
Association for the implementation of recovery of costs in secondary schools [para.
5.2 (e)].
Skill Training Program (estimated baseline cost US$1.4 million)
2.29       The skill training component would establish within MCMA (currently the only
management training institution in the country), modular secretarial, computer, accounting,
business and management courses that would better respond to both private and public sector
needs. The present MCMA courses would be streamlined and made more relevant, and their
length and timing would be adjusted to facilitate civil service and private sector participation.
Fees would be charged and paid by the individual or sponsoring government services, with
MCMA having an autonomous program budget and authority to retain course fees collected. The
autonomous program budget would be controlled by MCMA's Management Council and would
enable it to pay competitive salaries to its full and part-time tutors. It is estimated that by the
fourth year of implementation, the fees could cover up to 75 percent of the cost of running the



27
institution. The cost effectiveness of establishing post "O level" skill training programs in the
Maldives is discussed in Annex 7.
2.30        The following training activities would be undertaken at MCMA:
(a)   basic and executive secretarial courses with computer training; introductory
and intermediate accounting courses with computer skills6 salesman/business
principles courses7; and general office operation and office management.
These courses would serve the lower and mid-level staff in the public and
private sectors. The modular courses would offer 36 to 90 hours of contact
training. Participants from both the public (sponsored by various government
agencies) and the private sector would pay course registration fees to be
retained by MCMA, which would operate on an autonomous program budget;
(b)   a limited number of mid- and senior-level management, project
implementation and monitoring and auditing training programs for both the
public and private sector participants. These courses would be largely self-
financing and fees determined on the basis of the length of the course and
source of instructor. The duration of these courses would be from one day to
a maximum of four weeks; and
(c)   new induction courses as in (a) above for existing and new civil service staff
following "O level" and for existing staff (grade 7 or more) who have
completed the NFEC equivalency program.
2.31        The above proposals would contribute toward the efficient substitution of Maldivians
for expatriates in jobs such as book-keepers, secretaries, computer operators, managers and
supervisors. Furthermore, there are large and growing numbers of school leavers, graduates and
civil servants who could utilize such training to gain the skills needed to compete for positions in
the work-force. Within Government, the lack of a sufficient number of public servants with
these skills hampers productivity and effectiveness.
2.32        MCMA would be fully accountable to a Management Council headed by a senior
government official and would include private sector representation. The Council would regulate
the fees charged and determine how the funds would be used. In order to make the transition to
self management from the present government controlled arrangements, a review of the current
MCMA management, staffing and budgetary procedures has been undertaken. Because of the
proposed extended and new training focus, MCMA would benefit from the assistance of a
regional link institution. That LI would be contracted to supply, during the first two years of the
Project, a training and management advisor. The advisor and other LI staff would help with the
6/  Since the country goal is to move away from the single entry book-keeping technique, now used by the public sector,
the accounting courses would stress the double entry technique used by the private sector and internationally.

letters of credit, taxation, etc.

review of existing programs, assist with the adaptation of new programs, set up suitable
examination and certification processes and continue to assist MCMA on a needs basis during the
project period. During the early stages of the Project, the LI would also supply instructors who
could teach courses while the Maldivian staff were being trained and assist, as necessary, the
Maldivian trainers. The LI would also undertake both in-country and LI short-term staff training
for up to 16 Maldivian trainers.
2.33       It is expected that by the third year of implementation, a minimum of 40 courses
would be offered annually to a total of about 1,200 to 1,500 trainees during the project period.
The Project would finance about 40 staff-months of TA and about 110 staff-months of overseas
training, equipment (including computer software and hardware), furniture, reference and
teaching materials and operational costs for both the instructors and trainees. The Project would
also finance minor additions and renovations of classrooms and teaching spaces.
2.34       In addition, to strengthen other skill training programs, the Project would assist: (a)
VTC with staff training and the replacement of essential equipment and the purchase of books
estimated to cost US$330,000; and (b) IHS with staff training, atoll courses in midwifery (all
skills), clinical practicum for the nurse trainees and atoll staff training in family planning and
management estimated to cost US$350,000.
2.35       During negotiations, Government provided IDA with the name of the regional link
institution and provided assurances that it would by January 31, 1996, enable the MCMA or its
successor to carry out its functions with an autonomous program budget [para. 5.2 (f)].
Fellowship Program (estimated baseline cost US$6.2 million)
2.36       This component would provide financial support for overseas post-secondary training
to qualified Maldivian students in order to fill critical skill gaps in the public sector and to
provide a pool of trained personnel to meet private sector labor market requirements. In the
public sector, fellowship priority would be provided to those areas experiencing critical skill gaps
and to those skills that will have the highest development impact (e.g., trainers of secondary
teachers and nurses); those who will substitute for costly expatriates (e.g., engineers); and those
who have specialized skills without which critical functions could not be performed within
Government (e.g. attorneys, fisheries scientists, architects). Such fellowships would be awarded
on the basis of academic achievement; a portion of the costs would be recovered over time from
the students; and the individuals would be bonded to work in the Maldives, but not necessarily
for any agency or sector.
2.37       To ensure that the fellowship program is cost-effective and its coverage is
maximized, the majority of the funds would be for training within the region (costing US$7,000
to 10,000 per year per trainee). More and more regional institutions offer courses that can meet
the needs of the Maldives for technical and middle level management skills in both Government
and the private sector. Only in those areas in which adequate training programs are not available
in the region, or in which the likely development impact of the training is expected to be very
high (e.g., government senior official), should high-cost OECD training options be pursued.



29
2.38        A partial cost-recovery mechanism would be instituted for the fellowship grants as a
better way to link training costs to beneficiaries and to encourage students to be more cost-
effective in their training choices. It would also start to build-up financial reserves to serve as
the nucleus of a financially self-sustaining scholarship fund. In setting up a cost-recovery
mechanism for the fellowship program: (a) costs should be only partially recovered to encourage
compliance and to compensate for the lack of domestic higher education institutions; (b) an
administratively simple, uniform cost recovery formula should be used for all participants;
(c) repayments should be spread out over no more than three times the training period; (d) cost
recovery rates should be proportional to the cost of the training, that is, higher for higher cost
programs; (e) all overseas fellowships should be subject to cost recovery; and (f) the cost
recovery proceeds should be used to finance new fellowships. Sample cost recovery procedures
are listed in Annex 8.
2.39        The Project would provide financial support for the overseas training of about 260
persons, a threefold increase over the numbers sent for overseas scholarships under the first
Project. Of these, about 180 persons would be provided with diploma and certificate training and
about 80 with 4-year degree training. Table 2.1 below provides details of the estimated numbers
by type of degree/diploma/certificate, the distribution of training in the region or OECD
countries and the distribution of training opportunities across the public and private sectors.

2.40       Financial support in OECD countries would include three fellowships for the nurse
trainers at the IHS and one for an education planner from MOE. The balance would be allocated
to top priority areas within the civil service. Specific longterm fellowships would be targeted as
follows: 15 for NRSS, 7 for IHS, 7 for VTC, 12 for MCMA and 18 for ITE.
2.41       An annual training program for both the public and private sectors will be prepared
by MPHRE's Scholarship Section and reviewed and finalized by the NSB. To determine eligible
fields for private sector fellowships, the Labor Section of MPHRE will work together with the
NSB, the SS and the private sector consultative group, taking into consideration the skill gaps
identified through interviews with private sector employers, the labor market survey and the
monthly review of expatriate employment applications. Private sector representation in SS would
be obtained through the participation of at least two persons from the private sector consultative
group. The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) would manage the fellowship program, and
monitor performance and the after-completion employment status of returning fellows. SS staff
would be strengthened by the addition of a full-time accountant and an assistant administrative
officer. Under the Project, financing would be provided for SS and NSB staff to visit training
institutions in the South and East Asia region to identify and obtain places for the fellows in
appropriate training institutions.
2.42       The recently initiated practice of public advertising fellowship posts is a good one,
and helps to attract the most qualified candidates. However, better selection criteria are still
needed. Sound academic achievement ("A level" passes), the degree to which the proposed
training meets a critical skill gap and is in line with national priorities, and the cost-effectiveness
of the proposed training are all factors that should be considered when screening fellowship
applications. The proposed selection criteria are listed in Annex 9.
2.43       The following policies were finalized during negotiations: (a) flexible administration
of the bonding of returning fellows to government service; (b) establishment of cost-recovery
from public- and private-sector fellows; (c) agreement on the criteria to be used for selecting
fellows; and (d) agreement on the processes to be used for prioritization of fellowship training
activities. Government provided a list of fellowships for the first two years of the Project.
2.44       During negotiations, Government provided assurances that it would:
(a)   by June 30, 1995, commence to implement measures satisfactory to the
Association for the recovery of costs of the fellowship program [para. 5.2
(g)]; and
(b)   maintain with staff, resources and responsibilities satisfactory to the
Association the National Scholarship Board for selection of fellowships [para.
5.2 (h)(i)].
Strengthening Financial Management (estimated baseline cost US$0.3 million.)
2.45       Improved financial practices and mechanisms need to be established to ensure more
effective and equitable financing of education services. This component would: (a) develop a



31
unit-cost based formula for central government grants and subsidies to atolls and educational
institutions; (b) establish a workable mechanism for tracking, monitoring and projecting
educational spending; and (c) strengthen the budgetary processes needed to underpin the long-
term expansion of the education sector.
2.46       A key objective would be to assist MOE to arrive at an equitable budgetary
allocation while directing the scarce recurrent resources towards quality inputs. The allocation
process would also determine the needed level of private contributions necessary for quality
education. Government financing would be based on a formula to be reviewed annually taking
into account inflation and cost increases. This formula would be based on school size
(enrollments and staff based on agreed student:teacher ratios), level of education, location of the
school, curriculum and programs offered and maintenance of programs and facilities. The
formula would also take into consideration periodic and necessary replacement and replenishment
of essentials such as textbooks and educational materials.
2.47       Strategies for improving the cost-effectiveness of education expenditures have been
identified and included in the Project: (a) introducing cost-recovery measures for vocational and
tertiary fellowship programs; (b) raising primary and secondary student:teacher ratios; lowering
secondary education costs by reducing dependence on expatriate teachers; maximizing the
utilization of existing facilities and improving education quality and relevance so as to reduce
repetition rates and enhance access to the labor market; (c) making more use of lower-cost, Asia-
region training programs to meet post-secondary skill shortages; (d) improving the quality of
existing primary and lower secondary programs and teachers to ensure that the graduates can
meet the demands placed upon them by the Maldives highly competitive labor market; and (e)
expanding secondary education by establishing more viable and cost effective consolidated lower
secondary schools in the atolls.
2.48       The expansion of education, improved quality, and greater cost-effectiveness all
require strong financial management. At present, the financial management of education
expenditures is hampered by: (a) a lack of a suitable mechanisms for financial reporting and
monitoring; (b) multiple budget points; (c) financing of non-educational outlays under the
education budget; and (d) a lack of a budgetary links between education sector capital and
recurrent outlays. The Project plans to strengthen the programming, budgeting and financial
monitoring functions of the MOE, by setting-up a management information system and by staff
training. These efforts would result in: (a) development of a data base on allocation and use of
educational expenditures clearly linking provision with services; (b) strengthening of the MOE
institutional capability to plan and forecast educational expenditures; (c) generation of a
management information system that can be used to assess policy tradeoffs in the allocation of
education spending, including financial and educational indicators for different educational
institutions and programs; (d) development of a framework for forecasting educational
expenditures and linking capital and recurrent spending in education; and (e) development of
budgeting capabilities. The component's sub-activities are listed in Annex 10.
2.49       The financial details of this component are as follows: about US$10,000 would be
allocated for pilot testing of data collection, US$15,000 for the design of an MIS system,
US$55,000 for automation of the MIS, US$10,000 for familiarization visits to Malaysia, Fiji and



32
Tonga, US$45,000 for staff training, US$30,000 for public expenditure review and analysis of
education indicators, US$40,000 for special studies and US$85,000 for TA, for a total of
US$290,000.
2.50       During negotiations, Government provided assurances that it would by May 31,
1996, and by May 31 of each year thereafter, review the financing of education and training
services, and thereafter exchange views with the Association on the findings and
recommendations of the review [para. 5.2 (i)].
Project Funded Studies (estimated baseline cost US$0.2 million)
2.51       Three staff-months of TA would be provided under the Project for two studies which
would be used to assess: (a) education testing and examinations; and (b) the most suitable and
viable in-country post-secondary training options. Details on these studies are given in Annex
11. The Project would also allocate funds for the preparation of future projects. During
negotiations, Government provided assurances that it would carry out, in accordance with
programs, procedures, timetables and terms of reference satisfactory to the Association, the
studies under the Project [para. 5.2 (j)(i)].
Impact on Women
2.52       The Project is expected to enhance educational opportunities for females by
expanding access to lower secondary schools in the atolls. In-service and other teacher training
activities will provide significant benefits to women since over 60 percent of the teachers are
female. The introduction of in-country training in such fields as secretarial support, accounting,
computers and management will greatly increase in-country training opportunities for women.
(Women currently benefit from only 30 percent of post-O and A level external training
opportunities and are often reluctant to go abroad or do not get the chance.) The use of
education indicators and financing formula, which would include a review of women's
participation at various levels of education and training, would help focus policy makers'
attention on the need to address women's training requirements.
Environmental Assessment
2.53       No negative environmental impact is expected under the Project. On the contrary,
increased access to secondary education and updated teacher training programs, which include
environmental topics, will benefit the country. Expansion of educational opportunities outside of
Male' will help reduce population pressures in the capital city, and by implication, reduce the
environmental strains associated with urban over-crowding. By providing a cadre of educated
youth in the north, and in other atolls, the Project would help to decentralize economic activity
away from Male', and hence further relieve some of the population pressures in the capital city.
Expansion of female education will also help reduce fertility.
2.54       No coral would be used in the construction of the NRSS and the SCSs. None was
used at the SSS during the first Project. The schools would be built on existing vacant sites



33
already owned by Government, with suitable facilities provided for the disposal of liquid and
solid waste. Written assurances have been obtained from the authorities that no coral would be
used in the construction or remodelling of the project capital works.
2.55       Construction activities in Male' itself under the Project would be modest, and
confined primarily to the refitting and extending of the ITE to initially accommodate teacher
education needs. The Project would also undertake minor refurbishing at MCMA. In addition,
an effort would be made to improve the environmental impact of the ITE facility. The existing
ITE site draws its water supply from groundwater pumps which have been infiltrated with salt
water and are therefore nearly depleted. Under the Project, steps would be taken to connect ITE
to the desalinated water supply.
2.56       Strengthening secondary teacher training should result in increased environmental
knowledge. The lower secondary teachers would be given intensive training in environmental
science. As they take up responsible teaching positions in the community, they will become a
vital source of environmental information for the nation's youth. Many of these teachers will
localize positions presently held by expatriates, few of whom have had any formal training in, or
understanding of, the fragile ecology of the Maldives.
2.57       All necessary environmental related agreements and assurances have been obtained
during project appraisal.

3.2           Basis of Cost Estimates.  Baseline costs are estimated at June 1994 prices, at the
time of the appraisal mission. Construction costs are based on contract awards for similar
facilities in Maldives and on the cost of the SSS constructed under the first Project. Furniture
costs for NRSS and SCSs upgrading and extensions are estimated from 10 to 12 percent of
construction costs. Equipment costs are estimated on the basis of the cost of equipment at SSS
with a factor for inflation and include transportation and installation costs. The initial supply of
consumables for all institutions has been estimated to cost about 10 percent of the cost of the
equipment. Building materials and equipment, books and educational materials imported for use
in the Project are all exempt from  import duties and taxes. Consultant costs include salaries,
allowances and airfare. Unit costs for fellowships are based on actual unit costs of fellows
currently studying overseas under the first Project and average about US$500 per month in
regional institutions and US$2,500 per month in OECD countries. It is expected that more than
three-quarters of the fellows will study in regional institutions.
3.3           Contingencv Allowances.  The contingency allowance of US$1.5 million (about 9.5
percent of baseline costs) includes contingencies for unforeseen physical conditions and for
estimated price increases. Physical contingencies were estimated at 10 percent of baseline costs
for civil works, furniture and equipment, books and educational materials, 5 percent for TA,
fellowships and in-country training and workshops and 0 percent for all other categories. Price



36
increase contingencies were calculated for both local and foreign costs in accordance with the
following expected average annual price increase percentages:
1995   1996   1997   1998   1999
Foreign                                   2.0    2.5    2.7    2.5    2.6
Local                                     8.0    5.0    5.0    5.0    5.0
Accordingly, aggregated price increases are estimated at about 4.6% of baseline costs plus
physical contingencies.
3.4        Foreign Exchange Component. The foreign exchange component of US$15.2
million (about 85 percent of total estimated project costs) has been calculated on the basis of the
following foreign exchange percentages: civil works--80 percent; furniture--50 percent;
equipment, books and educational materials--95 percent; overseas specialists--90 percent;
fellowships--100 percent; local printing--20 percent; and local specialists, in-country training and
workshops and recurrent costs--0 percent.
B. Financing
3.5        The proposed IDA Credit of US$13.4 million equivalent would finance about 75
percent of the total estimated project cost. AIDAB (and other ongoing Australian programs) and
IDB would finance on a parallel basis, about US$1.2 million and US$2.3 million equivalent, or 5
percent and 15 percent of the total estimated project cost, respectively. Government would be
responsible for the remaining 5 percent of project costs or about US$1.0 million equivalent. The
IDA Credit would cover about 88 percent of the estimated foreign exchange cost of the Project.
Written confirmations of AIDAB and IDB parallel financing were received during negotiations.
3.6        The AIDAB financing would cover part of the cost of establishing the new lower
secondary teacher training program and some primary teacher training costs at the ITE including
TA to be provided by an Australian link institution both in Male' and at the institution,
attachments by new teacher training staff at the link institution, administrative costs, long-term
fellowships both in Australia and by distance education in Maldives and local translation in
Maldives of necessary educational materials. IDB financing would cover the cost of constructing
and furnishing the new NRSS (Annex 14).

3.7        Recurrent Expenditures. Education projects tend to have high recurrent cost
implications, partly because they are labor intensive and partly because they involve expanding
access to social services to large segments of the population. This particular Project, however,
would be providing a relatively large number of fellowships to already existing public servants
and would be training large numbers of individuals who are (or will be) working in the private
sector. Hence, compared to other education projects, the recurrent cost implications of this
Project are relatively more modest and are further reduced by the impact of the policy measures
as described below.
3.8        Additional recurrent costs to Governmnent caused by the Project would consist of
teacher and administrative staff salaries for the ITE, MCMA, NRSS and SCSs, operational costs
for all new construction and student allowances at the ITE, MCMA and secondary schools.
These will amount to about US$300,000 per year by the end of the Project, and would be
equivalent to only an additional 2.2 percent of the Government's 1993 recurrent budget for
education.



38
3.9        At the same time, several project components are designed to reduce the budgetary
burden of the education sector. Preliminary examination of the plan to reduce high
student:teacher ratios suggests the possibility of a 20 percent reduction in teacher costs at the
primary level, with such funds used to offset enrollment growth. At the secondary level, the
Project, through the establishment of more cost effective schools, would generate very limited
cost increases resulting from consolidated expansion. At that level, there is also scope to
increase student:teacher ratios in Male' thus reducing teacher costs. Under the Project, the
replacement of costly expatriate teachers (who make-up 75 percent of the secondary teacher force
and whose salaries/allowances cost over twice as much as that of identically qualified nationals)
would reduce the country's recurrent costs from about US$250,000 following the first ITE lower
secondary output and would reach a cumulative of about US$4.0 million per annum by the end of
the Project thus more than offsetting the project costs. In addition, it is estimated that the cost-
recovery measures for vocational and fellowship training will net Government close to Rf 3
million per annum allowing them to cover some expansion costs, but, particularly to focus on
quality improvements. The fellowship cost recovery funds (expected to average about 30 percent
of the cost) will allow Government to set-up an ongoing national fellowship program (depending
on the cost scenario used, enabling Government, at the end of the Project, to allocate from 40 to
70 fellowships per annum). The financial rationalization and use of more equitable financing
formulas and monitoring will result in the more equitable and cost effective operation of the
education programs. Fellowship training for nearly 300 public trainees will allow Government to
deliver better quality services and allow the private sector to benefit from training opportunities
(for which they will pay back 10 to 50%). Finally, the policy/studies component will identify
ways of rationalizing education spending. On balance, the net recurrent cost impact of the
Project should be positive.

3.11       Contracts for construction of the civil works for extension/remodelling/refurbishing at
the ITE, SCSs and MCMA would be awarded on the basis of LCB procedures (including foreign
bidders) which are satisfactory to the Association (US$2.9 million). Construction of the NRSS
and procurement of its furniture would be contracted using the tender procedures of IDB



40
(US$0.2 million). Contracts for wooden furniture (estimated cost US$0.3 million) would be
awarded on the basis of LCB procedures while specialized tubular/plastic furniture (estimated cost
US$0. l million) would be procured by international shopping on the basis of quotations from a
minimum of three suppliers from at least two countries. Equipment packages (including
computers) estimated to cost US$50,000 or more (estimated cost US$0.6 million) would be
awarded on the basis of ICB procedures in accordance with Association Guidelines. Other
equipment estimated to cost less than US$50,000 per package and aggregating to less than US$0.2
million, would be procured by international shopping on the basis of quotations from a minimum
of three suppliers from at least two countries. Books, instructional materials and software
(estimated cost US$0.4 million) would be procured directly from publishers. Printing contracts
estimated between US$10,000 to 20,000 totalling about US$0.1 million would be awarded on the
basis of quotations from a minimum of three printers from at least two countries. For ICB
procurement the standard IDA ICB bidding documentation would be used and prior review by
the Association of bidding documents and proposed contract awards would be required for all
equipment contracts estimated to cost US$50,000 or more and for all civil works contracts
estimated to cost US$200,000 or more. Government presently has the capacity to undertake this
procurement. Consultants would be selected in accordance with Association Guidelines for the
Use of Consultants (Annex 15). Contracts with consulting firms costing more than US$100,000
and contracts with individual consultants costing more than US$50,000 would be subject to prior
review by the Association. Fellowships would be awarded under the Government's current
administrative procedures which are satisfactory to the Association, with special emphasis given to
study in regional institutions. (See Annex 16 for procurement thresholds and prior review
requirements, a statement of the Government's procurement capacity and the procurement
implementation  schedule.)  During negotiations, Government provided assurances that it would
carry out, in accordance with programs, procedures, timetables and terms of reference satisfactory
to the Association, the training, fellowships and technical assistance under the Project [para. 5.2
(j)(ii)J.
3.12        Disbursements. The proposed Credit of US$13.4 million equivalent would be
disbursed over a period of five and a half years (Annex 17). No disbursement profile has yet
evolved for Maldives. Disbursements would be made as follows: (a) civil works--95 percent of
total expenditures; (b) equipment, furniture, books and educational materials--100 percent of
foreign expenditures, 100 percent of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) and of local printing and
80 percent of local expenditures for other items procured locally; (c) specialists--100 percent of
total expenditures; (d) fellowships--100 percent of total expenditures; and (e) in-country training
and workshops--100 percent of total expenditures.
3.13        Special Account. Under the proposed Credit, a special account equivalent to
US$700,000 to finance project expenditures for four months would be set up and maintained in
US dollars at a bank in Maldives acceptable to the Association.8 Applications for replenishment
of the special account would be submitted to the Association preferably monthly, but not less than
quarterly or when the amounts withdrawn equal 50 percent of the initial deposit. As prior review
is required by the Association for bidding documents and contract awards for procurement of
goods costing more than US$50,000 equivalent, consulting firms costing more than US$100,000
8/ The authorized allocation would be limited to an amount equivalent to US$500,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals
from the Credit plus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments equals the equivalent of US$2.0 million or more.



41
equivalent and individual consultants costing more than US$50,000 equivalent (para. 3. 11), this
review should have taken place, the Association's no objection received by the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU), and copies of signed contacts forwarded, before any payments are
made from the special account for these expenditures. Replenishment of the special account for
all other types of expenditures eligible for payment from the Credit would be made against
statements of expenditure for which relevant documents would be retained by the PIU and made
available for review, as requested, by visiting Association missions.
3.14       Accounts and Audits. The PIU would establish and maintain a separate account for
all project expenditures. The account would be maintained in accordance with sound accounting
practices. Auditing of the account would be performed annually in accordance with procedures
satisfactory to the Association and an audit report, including a separate statement on
disbursements against statements of expenditure, submitted to the Association within six months
of the end of the Government's fiscal year.
C. Project Management and Implementation
3.15       Project management and implementation would be the responsibility of MPHRE
where a sub-unit (MPHRE staff with prime responsibilities for the Project) referred to as the
Project Implementation Unit was established to implement the first Project. It currently has
seven permanent staff positions including a Project Director, Project Manager, Procurement
Officer, Project Accountant, Implementation Officer and assistant accounting and implementation
officers. All positions are currently filled except the two Implementation Officers who are being
recruited. The MPHRE Director General of Human Resources is the Project Director. Twelve
months of short-term overseas fellowships would be provided under the Project for three PIU
staff as would six staff-months of TA for project implementation advisors. During negotiations.
Government provided assurances that it would maintain with staff, resources and responsibilities
satisfactory to the Association, the Project Implementation Unit established under the ongoing
Education and Training Project [para. 5.2 (h)(ii)].
3.16       The PIU would continue to operate as it did for the first Project. It would
coordinate the signing of contracts with the various specialists required under the Project. The
NSP would be managed by the PIU with the advice of NSB, under existing procedures which are
satisfactory to IDA. The PIU would also be responsible for procurement of equipment, books
and educational materials and furniture for the project institutions. MOE would draw up lists and
specifications for the required items. PIU would prepare the bid documents, carry out the
bidding and award contracts for the equipment, materials and furniture, and oversee its delivery
and installation. The Ministry of Construction and Public Works (MCPW) would be responsible,
in cooperation with the PIU and the MOE, for the preparation of designs, working drawings and
bid documents for construction at the SCSs, ITE and MCMA. On the basis of these documents,
the PIU would conduct the bidding under the Government's LCB procedures (para. 3. 11) and,
with the help of the MCPW and the MOE, manage the construction contracts. Following
completion of construction and installation of equipment, the MOE would assume responsibility
for running the institutions. The studies would be implemented by MOE and MPHRE under the
coordination of PIU. The PIU would also submit withdrawal applications to the Association,



42
maintain the project accounts, arrange for the annual audit of these accounts, fulfill the
Association's reporting requirements and liaise officially with the Association.
3.17       The Project Coordinating Committee (PCC), established under the first Project,
would assist in overall project coordination and management. The PCC is chaired by MPHRE
and includes senior representatives of MOE, Ministry of Health and Welfare, MCPW, Ministry
of Finance and Treasury, Department of External Resources, and Ministry of Atolls
Administration. The Committee would continue to meet periodically to provide guidance in
policy matters and to advise the PIU, as necessary.
3.18       The Project would be implemented over a period of five years, starting in early
1995. All project components dealing with civil works and infrastructure would be completed
within four years and all other project activities in five years. The project closing date could be
extended to five and a half years to accommodate the fellowship and training cycles. However,
if another IDA project came on stream after the four years and only the fellowship component
remained, such activity could be transferred to the new project. Thus, all project activities would
be completed by December 31, 1999. The closing date would be six months later on June 30,
2000. The project implementation schedule and the implementation and supervision plans are
listed in Annex 18.
3.19       Monitoring and Reporting. Implementation performance would be monitored in four
ways:
(a)   a semi-annual progress report would be prepared by the PIU and submitted to
IDA in June and December every year, which would include a summary by
component of implementation progress (actual versus planned), a financial
summary, an updated implementation schedule, a list of issues and problems
and the work plan for the following period;
(b)   PIU would also update annually the key indicators. These indicators are listed
in Annex 19 and include such items as enrollments, transition rates,
student:teacher ratios, female participation rates, teacher attrition rates,
fellowship program indicators, etc.;
(c)  implementation reviews would be held annually and the above monitoring
reports would be discussed with all concerned authorities during the review;
and
(d)  a mid-term review would be conducted in 1997 during the third year of the
project implementation period. The review would focus on (i) progress made
in quality improvement through the teacher and skill training components and
the fellowship program; (ii) civil works procurement and other implementation
matters; and (iii) the financing plan for the education sector.



43
3.20       During negotiations. Government provided assurances that it would:
(a)  by March 31, 1996, and by March 31 of each year thereafter, carry out with the
Association and the co-financiers, a review of the progress of the Project, including
a review of education and project indicators agreed with the Association [para. 5.2
(k)];
(b)  by January 31, 1998, conduct a comprehensive mid-term review with the Association
with regard to the actions taken pursuant to the program of action and the
implementation of the Project, in line with the objectives of the Project. [para. 5.2
(1)].
3.21       The PIU would prepare and submit a project implementation report to IDA no later
than six months after the project closing date.



44
IV. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
4. 1        Benefits. The benefits to be derived from the Project are as follows:
(a) the teacher education component is expected to: (i) improve the quality of primary education;
(ii) reduce the number of untrained teachers in primary schools (mainly women); and (iii) lower
the costs of employing secondary teachers by training Maldivians rather than hiring costly
expatriates;
(b) the secondary education component would: (i) increase access to quality secondary education
for some 1,400 additional atoll students, including female and poor students; (ii) flexible
administration of the student bonding system would be implemented to allow them to select
employment in either public or private sectors; and (iii) institute limited cost recovery measures
in government schools for quality improvements;
(c) the skill training program and institutional staff training activities would: (i) substitute
Maldivians for expatriates in skilled jobs in the public and private sectors by providing local
access to skill training; (ii) reduce skill shortages in the civil service; and (iii) improve the output
of the health, vocational and management institutions;
(d) the fellowship program would: (i) provide fellowships for both the public and private sectors;
(ii) strengthen the links between economic needs and fellowship allocations; (iii) improve
fellowship selection criteria and cost recovery mechanisms to promote sustainability; and
(iv) increase the number of beneficiaries by directing more fellows into lower cost regional
institutions;
(e) the financial plan would: (i) strengthen budget management; and (ii) establish financial
formulas to use the allocated resources more effectively; and
(f) the studies would improve sector knowledge and decision-making.
4.2         Risks. The main risks identified include the possibility of: (a) difficulties in
reaching consensus on secondary cost recovery strategies; (b) resistance in the atolls to secondary
consolidated expansion policies which limit support only to secondary schools of a viable size; (c)
delays in the establishment of an autonomous program budget for the MCMA; and (d) potential
reluctance to implement sustainable management and financial policies in spite of the precarious
macro situation which needs redressing to ensure that spending in the sector will be sufficient to
allow the project inputs to be sustained.
4.3         These risks are minimized, however, by Government's realization that due to the
very difficult economic situation in the Maldives, education policies will have to be changed,
especially those relating to cost recovery at the secondary level and in the fellowship program,
and to limiting the establishment of atoll secondary schools only to those of a viable size. In
addition, the MPHRE which recently assumed responsibility for the operation of the MCMA,
plans to support the paying of fees for training at this institution. Finally, due to its difficult
fiscal situation, Government accepts that the financial processes for education and training
activities need to be consolidated and the use of limited resources maximized. On that basis, they
support a review of financial procedures and mechanisms for allocation of education funds based
on formulas.

into two groups: B and C. Students are required to choose two subjects from Group B and one from
Group C, depending on the subjects being offered in any one year by each school. In some schools,
the subjects offered depend on the availability of teachers and facilities, more than on student
preference. In general, students are in class for 40-45 periods, of about 35-40 minutes each in a 5
day week. Normally, the teaching load is expected to be about 30 periods per week.

MINISTRY OF PLANNING, HUMAN RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT
Male', Republic of Maldives
18 January 1995
Mr. Joseph Wood
Vice President
South Asia Regional Office
World Bank
1818 H Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20433
Dear Mr. Wood,
The Government of Maldives is requesting assistance from the International Development
Association through a Second Education and Training Project to meet urgent requirements
of education and skill development. The project will support policy reform and related
investments in its education sector. This letter describes the Government's policies in
education and training.
Maldives had verv high economic growth during the period 1975-90. That period was
marked by the development of the tourism industry in our countrv and a significant
expansion in the fisheries sector. We also had significant improvements in social indicators
over the last 20 vears. Maldives has achieved in 1994, a 98% adult literacy rate, an over
100% gross primary school education enrollment rate, a 36% secondary education
school. This progress reflects the prioritv given to education and training in public
expenditures: in 1993, education sector alone accounted for 18% of these expenditures.
Despite these achievements, the Government of Maldives is aware of the challenges the
country is facing in future development of education and training. The foremost challenge
stems from our rapid population growth rate which increases the demand for social
services and infiatrucaure. Geography and the small size of our population (238,000) make
the provision of these services verv costly. Another challenge ve face is the demand for a
higher level of service, i.e., the increasing demand for secondary and post-secondary
education and training. This demand not only reflects the aspirations of students and their
parents, but also the needs of our economy: both Government and the private sector lack
qualified Maldivian staff, as evidenced by the large share of expatriates in the work force. A
third challenge is to improve the quality of education: while we have expanded education
coverage, we still need to improve. in particular, the quality of our teachers.
A fourth challenge has developed over the last three years due to a deterioration in the
macroeconomic performance. in part due to lower international prices for our main exports
(tuna and other marine products). and to the negative impact of the recession in the OECD
countries on our tourism industry. These external factors tere compounded by a rapidly
increasing budget deficit. We are starting to correct the ensuing macroeconomic
imbalances. The need to reduce public expenditures will put severe limits on the future

growth of social sector spending, and we are aware that we need to increase the efficiency of  Page 2 of 4
those outlavs.
Within these macroeconomic constraints, we have formulated policies for the education
sector which aim at supporting the country's future economic growth. a more equitable
access to education, and to increase efficiency in providing these services.
One of the Government's goals is to achieve universal basic education up to grade 7 by the
year 2000. We also aim to improve the qualitv of primarv education where 31% of the
teachers still lack basic training. The main elements of our strategy at the primary level,
therefore, are pre- and in-service teacher training. Over the last few years we have made
progress in this respect, and expansion of our teacher training capacitv is included in the
proposed Second Education and Training Project. To improve the cost-effectiveness of
primary education, we wvill require, as a minimum, a student:teacher ratio of 30:1. We will
also aim to reduce our student repetition rate. estimnated to be around 20% in 1994, by
about I to 2% every year to reach about 14% by 1997. We intend to reduce the number of
unqualified teachers by about 1% per annum.
In the area of secondarv education. our goal is cost-effective expansion in the population
centers. We have broadened access to lower sccondarv schools, in particular for women,
through the opening of the Southern Secondary School in 1992. and will further expand
access by constructing a secondary school in the north. and bv upgrading several of the
larger atoll schools vith viable student populations to lower secondary school status. These
schools should provide the atolls %zith qualitv secondarv education. As a result of this
initiative, by 1998 the capacity of lower secondarv schools should increase by about 22%
over that achieved in 1993.
A crucial element in improving the quality of secondarv education is teacher training. We
aim to reduce the cost of our teaching staff bv reducing our reliance on expatriate teachers
who in 1994, made up 75% of the lowver secondarv teaching force. We %%ill also reduce the
cost of teacher training bv commencing a program of training lower secondarv teachers in
Maldives, rather than abroad.
An important element of our nev policyv will be to assess the implementation of macro cost
recovery measures which would contain secondary education cost recoverv measures. The
objectives of this cost recovery for secondarv schooling are to reduce the fiscal burden
associated with expanding secondarv education. encourage greater accountbilitv in the
education system, and establish a more equitable treatment of education finance. The
Government will assess the various approaches and would within a period of two years
finalize the scope and mechanisms for such cost recovery with a viewv to implementing such
measures. To improve cost-effectiveness in secondarv education ve propose to increase the
studentteacher ratio to 20:1 by 1997 and to 25:1 before year 2000. To meet increased
demand at the higher secondarv level we will also graduallv expand that level, with private
sector cooperation, while placing more emphasis on improved subject coverage balance
between the science, commerce and arts streams.
In vocational and skills training, we are increasing responsiveness to market needs. In
particular, we have reoriented the Maldives Center for Management and Administration
(MCMA) to offer training in skill areas wvhich are in high demand and for which training
has so far onlv been available overseas. We are also broadening access to our post
secondarv training institutions: the private sector is now encouraged to sponsor students at

the Vocational Training Center (VTC) and to attend courses on a fee paving basis at
MCMA.
With regard to skills tmining at the tertiary level, our main policy rformn concerns the
fellowship program. We have revised the selection criteria to give greater weightage to
academic achievements. The fellowship progrwn under the Second Education and Training
Project will focus on priority needs of the public and private sectors and will provide
fellowships for tertiary studies, 30% of which will be in countries in the region, thus
improving the program's cost-effectiveness. Students who receive awards under the
fellowship prograrn of the project will be obliged to repay part (10% - 50%/e) of their
overseas fellowship costs which will be used to finance new fellowships.
In considering private sector emplovment of the secondary school graduates, Government
would continue the flexible application of the bonding regulations, utilized since 1991,
which allows school leavers/graduates to move into further education or seek employment in
either the public or private sectors.
Finally, the expansion of education, qualitv improvement and greater cost-effectiveness, will
all require stronger management of the education nstem. As part of these efforts we will
continue to work closeiv writh the communitv and parental comrnittees and continue to
support private sector participation in the education sector. We are also taking measures to
strengthen the programming, budgetng, and monitoring funcuons of the Ministrv of
Education, based on an improved management information system. In particular, we will
continue the process of rationalizing the allocation of resources to the education system and,
within the education system, work towards arriving at a formula for resource allocation in
an equitable manner to all schools, and ensure adequate allocation for quality inputs. To
that end, we will continue the process of (a) regulariv monitoring and analyzing unit costs
in Govemnment spending in the education sector with a view to reducing disparities; (b)
improving the flow of funds to incra  accountability, and (c) strcamlining associated
budgetary procedures. Based on our targets we have developed a series of performance
indicators which we will implement and monitor annually. We will also aim at budget
consolidation linking education capital and recurrent spending requirements. We w*ill carry
out an annual review of the draft budget and its implementation, to ensure adherence to
these principles.
In order to abide by Government guidelines on environmental protection, coral will not be
used in anv construction work under the project.
In conclusion, the measures outlined above should allow us to expand our education sysmi,
upgrade its quality and efficiency and keep the education budget within a rmnge that is
consistent with macroeconomic stability and other priority expenditures in Maldives.
Sincerely yours,
Ministcr of Planning, Human Resources and Environment

Annex 4-A
REPUBLIC OF MALDIVES
SECOND EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROJECT
Estimated Secondary Teacher Needs
1.    National secondary teachers are currently trained overseas. Expatriate teachers account
for around 75 percent of the secondary teaching service (268 expatriates out of a total 358
secondary teachers in 1993). Of the 90 national teachers, 69 had qualifications in Dhivehi or
Islam; 8 in mathematics; 8 in English; 2 in history and I in biology.
2.    Based on MOE planning in 1993, and taking into account proposed initiatives within the
Project to develop the NRSS and four SCSs, it is estimated that student enrollments in grades 8-
10 will grow by some 3,600 places by 2000. Given the current student:teacher ratio (S/TR) of
around 17: 1, the demand for teachers would increase by some 220 or on average over 30 per
year. With a change in policy requiring a gradual increase in the S/TR to 25:1 by the end of the
Project in 1999, the number of additional teachers needed by 2000 would be reduced to fewer
than 35. Table 1 sets out the projected student enrollments to 2000 and the teacher demand
implications based on an S/TR of 17:1 and a variable S/TR increasing from 17:1 in 1994 to 25:1
by 1999.

* Project targets
3.    Set against a projected output from the in-country secondary teacher training program, of
some 30 graduates in 1997, increasing to 42 in 2000, it should be possible to begin to decrease
the number of expatriate teachers required from 1998. Depending on the progress made in
implementing changes to the S/TR, the decreases in expatriate demand could be as high as 54 in
1998 (ITE output of 34 new graduates, plus a saving of 20 positions through increase in S/TR to
22: 1). Based on salary savings for ITE graduates and fewer positions, which would otherwise be
filled by expatriates, the overall saving for 1998 would be in the vicinity of US$200,000.
4.   It is noted that projections for upper secondary (grades 11-12) indicate that the teacher
demand will double by 2000, to around 50. Further training and upgrading of expatriates will
therefore be necessary if the current high level of dependence on expatriates in these grades is to
be reduced over time.

SECOND EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROJECT
Costs and Benefits of Developing a Teacher Training Program
for Lower Secondary Teachers
1.         There are a total of 840 expatriate teachers in the Maldivian school system, costing
Government close to US$7 million in salaries and benefits each year. At the lower secondary
school level, the salary and benefits of an expatriate teacher cost approximately US$5,300 per
annum, compared to US$2,700 per annum for an equivalently trained Maldivian teacher of the
same qualifications. In addition to the government salary, the expatriate teachers augment their
incomes by providing private or group tuition in the evening hours, often doubling their salary
each month. Furthermore, there are indications that teacher salaries in Sri Lanka will rise by 20
to 30 percent in 1994/1995. This will translate quickly into an increase in the salary that will
have to be paid to expatriate teachers because the vast majority come from Sri Lanka, and the
supply of trained Sri Lankan teachers available for overseas employment in the Maldives is
reaching the limits of what can be supplied.
2.         A measure of the benefits to be gained by training Maldivian nationals to be
secondary school teachers is the difference in the total earnings of Maldivian secondary school
teachers compared to expatriate teachers, or about US$2,600 per annum. Over a fifteen year
period, and discounting back (at 6 percent in US$ terms), the present value of the difference in
gross earnings between a Maldivian secondary school teacher and an expatriate teacher would be
about US$25,600. It would thus be cost-effective to replace expatriate teachers if a training
program could be developed with a unit cost of less than US$25,600 per teacher trained.
3.         In fact, the benefits to society from localizing expatriate teachers would be greater
than the unit-benefits calculated above because many of the expatriate teachers employed in the
Maldives have sub-standard English skills, experience high turnover rates, require long
orientation and are unable to impart the Maldivian cultural context or understanding vital to the
education of young children. Taking these negative externalities into account would imply that
the economic benefits associated with localizing expatriate teaching positions, evaluated at social
opportunity costs, are far greater than the financial benefits associated with localizing these
positions. If the total cost of an experienced secondary school teacher (US$7,700 per annum
excluding private tuition) can be taken as the actual opportunity cost of a "suitable quality"
expatriate teacher, then the annual benefits from localizing secondary school expatriate teacher
posts, would be approximately $5,000 per year. Discounted over a fifteen year employment
period, the net benefits to society from localizing such a post would be approximately
US$49,300 per teacher.
4.         Table 1 below compares the costs of the teacher training program over time, against
the economic benefits that would accrue from localizing secondary school teacher posts. In
present value terms, the capital and recurrent costs of the proposed teacher training program are



58
Annex 4-C
Page 2 of 2
estimated to be US$1.7 million in constant 1994 terms to train about 430 lower secondary
teachers over the next decade. The present value of the savings associated with localizing these
teacher posts (or of not requiring additional expatriate teachers) would be close to US$3.0
million through 2003. The ratio of benefits to costs from the lower secondary training program
is thus estimated at 1.87, implying an 87 percent return on investment and additional recurrent
costs. This is an extremely high economic rate of return to a modest investment in this area. In
fact, the payback period from the proposed lower secondary teacher training program would be
only about 5 years from the start of the Project, with most of the benefits generated in the years
to follow. Unlike other social sector projects, the payback period for this investment is notably
short, because the benefits from the investment start to accrue very quickly.
5.        Over a ten year period, the projected unit-costs of establishing a training capacity
for lower secondary school teachers in the Maldives is approximately US$6,000 per junior
secondary school teacher trained. This compares favorably with the costs of sending teachers for
overseas training in Sri Lanka, which would in any event not provide a teacher training program
geared to meet the specific needs of the Maldivian education system. This implies that it would
be most cost-efficient to establish a teacher training facility in the Maldives rather than send
teachers abroad for training.

SECOND EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROJECT
Career Information and Guidance Program
1.           Purpose: The Career Information and Guidance Program will provide advice to
secondary, skill training and post-secondary students in two areas: (a) on the nature of, and
employment requirements for, entry into the various types of occupations in Maldives; and (b) on
training opportunities, requirements for such training and how these training programs respond to
skill gaps in Maldives.
2.            Rationale:    Traditionally students completing secondary education or further
studies have been obligated, under bonding arrangements, to work within the public sector for a
minimum of two years. The public sector has now reached the stage where bonding requiremets
can no longer be sustained. Staffing levels in the public sector are high and the private sector is
being denied access to skilled labor. The administrative adjustments to the bonding system will
mean that "graduates" from school or post-secondary institutions will have to seek employment
on the open market. The Career Information and Guidance Program will assist students seeking
to enter the workforce in becoming aware of the nature of different occupations and in relating
their own interests and capabilites to potential career paths. Similarly, students seeking to
undertake further studies will be able to obtain information on career opportunities and the types
of qualifications required to enter different occupations.
3.           Structure: It is proposed that the Career Information and Guidance Program
would comprise a small unit based in Male'. The unit would be part of a wider network, with
links to schools (with secondary students) and other relevant institutions (principally post-
secondary). Designated teachers ("career advisers") would be selected within each school or
institution, to provide assistance for the Career Guidance unit personnel. Staff within the unit
would adapt and prepare career related materials for distribution to schools and other institutions
and arrange visits from time to time to assist the career advisers and to meet with students, where
appropriate. The staff would also provide an in-service course for the career advisers, upon their
appointment, and later, as required.
4.           Staffing: Initially, it is anticipated that the unit would have two professional staff
and two administrative/secretarial support staff. Additional short-term appointments may be
required in the early stages to assist with the adaptation or preparation of materials. The work of
the staff in the unit would be complemented by relevant Government officials and private sector
personnel, who would be able to assist with the preparation and presentation of materials and also
visit schools and institutions, from time to time. Longer-term staffing needs would be assessed
on an annual basis, depending on the work load, particularly in relation to providing support for
the career advisers. Short-term overseas training for professional staff - 2 staff months per
person - prior to the commencement of the program, would be necessary.
5.           Commencement: The program was begun January, 1995.

REPUBLIC OF MALDIVES
SECOND EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROJECT
Cost-Effectiveness of Post "O Level" Skills Training in the Maldives
I.          During the next decade, an average of 5,000 students will graduate from or
otherwise leave the school system in the Maldives each year. Assuming labor participation rates
remain unchanged, close to 3,000 of these graduates and school leavers will be seeking
productive employment opportunities. In the past, Government was the main source of
employment for the population, guaranteeing employment to all secondary school students. This
situation has changed. Government can no longer afford a significant increase in public sector
employment. Furthermore, the large number of unskilled civil servants already hinders efficient
operations of public services. The next generation of graduates and school leavers will have to
seek productive employment in the private sector. With a relatively open labor market, the main
issue will be whether or not the domestic labor force is equipped with the practical skills needed
to compete for jobs in the private sector'.
2.          The large number of expatriates employed in the Maldives provides an indication of
the range of skills needed in the economy, and the 'value' of these skills, measured by the
compensation paid to private sector expatriates (see Table below). There is little risk that
Maldivians would flood the labor market in particular skill areas. The risk is greater, however,
that Maldivian students, unless well trained, will not be prepared to assume these positions.
Already, there are more than 4,000 expatriates employed in vocational skills (carpenter, plumber,
cook, mason, electrician) areas in the Maldives. There are also close to 3,000 expatriates
employed in the various skill categories (e.g., accountant, tour guide).
3.          In theory, Maldivian school leavers could be trained to fill any of these positions.
With a moderately tight labor market, it is important to ask whether or not it would be more
efficient for the country to train school leavers in these areas, or to continue to utilize expatriate
laborers. Put another way, can the benefits from skills acquisition in these areas outweigh the
costs of training?
4.          If we treat training (of school leavers and graduates) in these areas as an investment
in human capital, then the economic benefits can be computed as the difference in lifetime
earnings that would arise with or without the training. With low unemployment, the opportunity
cost of an untrained worker could be estimated at about $800 per annum, or roughly the wage
paid to unskilled workers in the construction sector. The annual difference in this, and the
earnings of a carpenter, cook, mechanic and accountant would be $1,600, $4,200, $2,400 and
$6,400, respectively. Spread over a fifteen year period, and discounting back earnings
differences at 6% per annum, the present value of the difference in income streams, for these
1/. Fisheries also acted to absorb many school leavers that could not otherwise find formal sector employment. The fisheries industry has
generated relatively little additional employment in recent years, and under existing technology, shows little promise of expanding
employment opportunities.



62
Annex 7
Page 2 of 2
occupational categories would be: $16,400 for a carpenter, $43,000 for a cook, $24,700 for a
mechanic, and $65,900 for an accountant. If the total training costs for each of these skill
categories are lower than these income benefits, than it is both privately and socially efficient to
provide training in these areas. If, for example, the training costs of an accountant exceed
$65,900 than it would be more efficient for the country to continue to employ expatriates than to
train domestic workers in this area. At present, domestic training costs in the trades (carpentry,
electrician, mechanic) are in the range of US$500-US$1500 per student trained, well below the
expected benefits arising from provision of skill training. In terms of the more highly skilled
professions, the cost of fellowship training in regional tertiary training institutions would also be
well below the expected benefits that would accrue from such skill training. This would apply,
of course, until domestic labor demand for these skill categories becomes saturated, which
depends both on the rate and composition of economic growth, and on the degree of market
access to expatriate labor.
5.         Private individuals would, however, be somewhat risk adverse and would not have
perfect information about labor market opportunities. They would only undertake (and finance)
training if the expected benefits were well in excess of the accumulated costs of training. Hence,
in providing training in these areas, the costs must be contained well below expected benefits.
To the extent that considerable private benefits will accrue to individuals from this sort of skill
training, it would be appropriate for Government to pursue cost recovery measures in these
fields.

Cost Recovery in Fellowship Training
1.         Demand for tertiary training is rising rapidly and is significantly in excess of the
capacity of the public sector to finance fellowships. Demand for skilled individuals is far in
excess of the capacity of the domestic labor market to supply them. Development of cost-
recovery measures for fellowship training will help improve the financial sustainability of tertiary
training and encourage individuals to seek training in line with the needs of the domestic labor
market.
Objectives
(a)   To reduce the fiscal burden on Government;
(b)   To provide trainees with an incentive to select cost-effective training sources;
(c)   To build-up a pool of domestically generated funds that can be used to defray part of
the costs of fellowship training;
(d)   To institute a pay-back mechanism so that the private sector could participate in
fellowship training; and
(e)   To better match the incidence of costs of training and the appropriation of private
benefits.
Design Principles
2.         A cost-recovery program for fellowship training should embrace the following
principles. It should be administratively simple. It should aim for a level of collection that is not
too low to be meaningless (in terms of signalling labor market choice) but also not too high to
encourage avoidance. Not all of the costs of fellowship training should be recovered because of
the positive external benefits accruing to society from the increased numbers of highly-skilled
Maldivians. Equal treatment should be provided to all students. And finally, it should be
designed in a way that allows individuals to trade-off public sector service for a portion of their
repayment cost.
3.         The proposed cost recovery formula for fellowship training is as follows:
(a)  individuals sent on fellowship training shall have the option to work in either the
public or the private sectors;
(b)  individuals who do not return from overseas training shall reimburse the full cost of
their training to Government;
(c)  all returning fellows shall reimburse Government from 10 to 50 percent of the total
cost (including travel, stipend, books and fees) of their scholarship. This amount

shall be defined as the fellowship repayment obligation (FRO), shall be denominated
in foreign exchange, and shall not be subject to interest;
(d)  individuals accepting a fellowship shall sign a guarantee to repay the FRO upon
return from their studies. This guarantee shall be co-signed by a second guarantor;
(e)  individuals working for Government may reduce their FRO by ten percent of the
total fellowship cost for each year of service to Government. This would be limited
to two years of public service;
(f)  repayment of the fellowship amount would begin immediately after returning to the
country and would continue for a period of up to three times the length of the
overseas training program;
(g)  the administration of the FRO would be managed by a commercial bank, under the
supervision of the MOFT. An FRO with the commercial bank would be established
at the conclusion of the training period;
(h)  individuals could pre-pay their FRO to the commercial bank;
(i)  the proceeds collected shall be deposited into a National Fellowship Fund to be used
to augment other resources provided to finance overseas fellowships; and
(j)  the resolution of fellowship repayment disputes would be the responsibility of the
NSB.
4.         Numerical examples have been prepared to help clarify the concept of the repayment
mechanism:
(a)   Student A is in the private sector and undertakes a 4 year fellowship at a regional
institution. The total fellowship cost is US$20,000. At the end of the program,
student A's FRO is US$6,000 (0.3 times $20,000). The FRO must be repaid over a
12 year period (3 times training length), giving a monthly repayment amount of
US$41.67.
(b)  Student B studies for 4 years in a regional institution. The total fellowship cost is
US$20,000. Student B's FRO is US$6,000 (0.3 times US$20,000). Student B
agrees to work for 2 years for Government, reducing the FRO by two-thirds (one-
third for each year of public service). Student B's adjusted FRO is US$2,000 which
must be repaid over a 12 year period (3 times training length), yielding a monthly
repayment amount of US$13.89.
(c)   Student C studies for 2 years in a regional institution. The total fellowship cost is
US$10,000. Student C's FRO is US$3,000 (0.3 times US$10,000). Student C
agrees to work for just 1 year for Government, reducing the FRO by one-third.

Student C's adjusted FRO is US$2,000 which must be repaid over a 6 year period (3
times training length), yielding a monthly repayment of US$27.78.
(d)  Student D studies for 4 years in Australia. The total fellowship cost is US$100,000.
Student D's FRO is US$30,000. Student D agrees to work for Government for two
years. Student D's adjusted FRO is $10,000 (FRO reduced by one-third for each
year of public service). Student D's FRO must be repaid over a 12 year period,
yielding a monthly repayment obligation of $69.44.
(e)  Student E studies for 4 years in a regional institution. The total fellowship cost if
US$24,000. Student E accepts an overseas employment offer and elects not to
return to the Maldives. Student E's fellowship repayment obligation is US$24,000
and must be repaid within 4 years.

Fellowship Candidate Selection Criteria
1.        The National Scholarship Board provided summary notes on selection criteria for
fellowship candidates as follows:
(a)   Academic qualifications: would include the UK - GCE grade and equivalent
academic achievements in other national exam systems;
(b)  Professional qualifications: would include short-term courses and other service
skills;
(c)   No bias would be accorded to individuals trained in the Science Education Center
versus abroad;
(d)  Academic and professional references would be required from the academic
institution and the employer. These references would be treated confidentially and
evaluated by NSB members;
(e)   Career goals would be provided by the individual and the link between these goals
and the training choice would be evaluated by the NSB; and
(f)   Outstanding academic, professional and leadership achievements would be recorded
and evaluated. This would also include membership in school associations, and key
roles played (i.e. prefect) in a school and excellence in sports;
2.         The nominating sector (department or agency) would conduct a panel interview (by
no fewer than three persons) of the candidates and provide each candidate a numerical rank on
the basis of the interview.
3.         The NSB would provide a numerical weighting to each of the selection criteria
(academic qualifications, professional qualifications, written references, career goals, outstanding
achievements, and the interview with the nominating sector). A weighted ranking scheme would
be used to assign total points to each candidate for the selection of fellowship nominees.

SECOND EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROJECT
Strengthening of Financial Management
For the financial management strenthening component the following actions would be
undertaken during project implementation:
(a)  During the first year, the Project would: (i) redesign the financial monitoring and
reporting procedures of the MOE which would be pilot-tested in 2-3 atolls (in close
consultation with the MOFT and the Auditor General's office); (ii) train and second
MOE planning staff to other nations that have stronger educational financial
management systems. The MOE project leader would, during the first year, travel
to Malaysia, Fiji and Tonga for a period of about 3 weeks to review education
planning and financial management practices in those countries. The MOE project
leader would also, during these visits, assess the possibility and desirability of
seconding MOE planning staff to these other departments for 1-2 months in years 1,
2 and 3 of the project; and (iii) strengthen MOE planning staff in financial
programming, budgeting, planning and monitoring through a combination of short-
period secondments (1-2 months) and short-term external training or attachments (1-
6 months). Also starting in the first year of the Project, the MOE planning unit
would produce an annual review of expenditures in the education sector. This would
include a set of indicators of educational and financial performance of different
institutions and programs in the sector. The public expenditure review will be linked
to the budget formulation and programming process. An attempt would be made to
provide forward budget projections that link capital and recurrent expenditure
requirements in the sector.
(b)  During the second year, an MOE management information system (MIS) would be
designed and during years 2 and 3 of the Project, an officer from the MOE planning
unit would be seconded to a link Ministry for a period of 1-2 months to become
familiar with improved budgeting and financial management practices. Also, during
years 2 and 3 of the Project, one individual from the MOE planning unit would
attend a short training course on public expenditure programming, budgeting and
management; and
(c)  Small scale special studies on financial policies in the education sector will be
undertaken aimed at identifying policy options to improve the efficiency and cost-
effectiveness of education expenditures. The scope of these studies would be defined
by the planning unit of the MOE, in consultation with IDA, and would draw upon,
and complement, the improved data collection, MIS, budgeting and programming
procedures implemented under the project sub-component. To support the
strengthening of financial management capabilities, the Project would finance up to
five months of short-term international technical assistance in financial programming,
budgeting, management and analysis to assist the planning unit of the MOE with the
implementation of the aforementioned project tasks. The MOE, in consultation with
the PIU of the MPHRE and IDA would define the terms of reference for the
consultants and recruit these in accordance with procedures satisfactory to IDA.

SECOND EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROJECT
Project Funded Studies
A. Education Examinations
1.         The Maldives education system utilizes external GCE examinations from the UK.
While these examinations have provided an important, objective means of measuring education
quality, there are concerns regarding the high costs and relevance of this testing approach. In
light of the considerable forecast expansion in secondary schooling, there is a need to identify
ways of improving both the relevancy and cost-effectiveness of education testing. This study
would assess the most effective way to conduct examinations at the secondary level. This activity
would provide funds to allow one or two Maldivians to visit and assess successful examination
organizations such as the South Pacific Board of Examination and Assessment in Suva. It would
also cover about a one month consultancy in examinations. Estimated costs for the above would
be about $20,000.
B. Management and Effectiveness of Post-Secondary Training Institutions
Improved vocational and other post-secondary training is one of the key strategic
objectives of the education sector during the next decade. For the vast majority of graduates and
school leavers, vocational training will play a key link in preparing them for the opportunities
available in the Maldivian labor market. Government has already made heavy investments in
institutions to provide training in management, hotel operations, teaching, nursing and vocational
skills. Strengthening these institutions, through staff development and provision of appropriate
materials and supplies, is an important component of this proposed Project. At the same time, as
the through-put and course-mix of these institutions increase, it will be important to examine
alternative management options and strategies for improving educational impact and effectiveness.
Various options, including the consolidation of the supervision and administration of these
institutes, reconstitution of the management structure to enable greater private sector
participation, corporatization or possibly privatization of selected institutes, and greater public-
private partnerships in training are all options that could be explored. A special study will be
mounted to analyse ways to improve the responsiveness and efficiency of these institutions. This
study will be undertaken by a team of three to four education and education management
specialists who will visit the Maldives for about one month. The expected costs of this activity is
estimated at $60,000.
C. Project Preparation Studies
The Project will allocate funds for the preparation of future projects in the education and
health sectors. An allocation of about US$40,000 has been retained for such activities.

SECOND EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROJECT
Government Procurement Capacitv
1.          Government has the capacity to handle the procurement proposed under the
Project. It has successfully implemented the first Education and Training Project where the
Southern Secondary School was constructed at a cost of about US$820,000 following
international competitive bidding. In addition, an estimated US$360,000 of educational and
office equipment, library books and other educational materials and US$140,000 of local and
imported furniture have been procured without difficulty under the first Project using
international and local competitive bidding procedures, shopping and negotiations with publishers.
Several government agencies participated in this procurement including the Ministries of
Planning, Human Resources and Environment and Education and the then Office of Physical
Planning and Design.
2.          In addition, the Ministry of Construction and Public Works (into which the Office
of Physical Planning and Design has recently been integrated) has in the past undertaken several
large projects funded by external agencies, the largest having been funded by the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) using that agency's procurement rules and regulations which are
similar to IDA's. When individual contracts have been expected to reach a certain size (about
US$15.0 million), funding has been provided under the ADB projects for international
consultants to assist with prequalification of bidders and the evaluation of bids.
3.           Construction of civil works under the proposed Project to be funded by the IDA
credit, due to their relatively small sizes would be contracted under local competitive bidding
procedures. (At least one Japanese construction firm is currently operating in the Maldives,
however, and may be expected to bid.) The Physical Planning and Construction Section of the
MCPW will prepare complete tender documents. This section is adequately staffed with two
architects, four engineers, two site engineers, four surveyors and seven draftsmen. Designs of
standard classroom blocks are already available and are straightforward and economical in
design. MCPW's Tender Office will handle the actual bidding. It too is adequately staffed with
one engineer with a master's degree, another with a diploma in engineering, one technical staff
and two draftsmen. Both units have adequate support staff. Depending on the size and
complexity of the individual tender packages, a special Tender Committee may or may not be
appointed.
4.           MPHRE's PIU will oversee the entire process with the MOE providing lists of its
requirements and the Project Coordinating Committee making the final decisions on the contract
awards. All LCB bid documents will be in English using the tender documents for local
competitive bidding which are currently being revised by an external consultant funded by ADB.
This consultant is reviewing the entire local competitive bidding process. The tender documents
will be submitted to the Bank for its no objection before being used under the Project.

Annex 16-B
Page 2 of 2
5.           The PIU itself will handle the equipment. books and educational materials and
furniture procurement. Equipment lists and specifications, and book and materials lists prepared
by experienced teachers will be provided by the MOE to the PIU. Furniture requirements will
also be submitted by the MOE. Furniture designs used for the SSS will be reviewed by the
MOE and MCPW, revised as necessary and used under this Project. The PIU will appoint
tender committees for both the equipment and furniture procurement. Standard Bank procedures
and documents will be used as they were for the first Education and Training Project.    The
PIU has a procurement officer and should have no difficulty in undertaking the required
procurement.
6.           Fellowship recipients will be chosen by the method described in Annex 9.
