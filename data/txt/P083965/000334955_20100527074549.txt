A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Country and sector issues

Bolivia

1.     With a gross national income per capita o f only US$l,OlO,' Bolivia i s the second
poorest country in Latin America. Since 2000, the country has passed through a period o f
uncertainty marked b y a series o f failed governments and social unrest. In December
2005, the election o f a new government headed b y E v o Morales with an absolute
majority o f 54 percent o f voters established a strong mandate for taking a new approach
to addressing the country's long-standing social problems. The new government has
announced i t s intentions to prioritize constitutional reform and poverty reduction based
on a governance model that accurately represent the interests o f Bolivia's primarily
indigenous population.

2.       Formal education in Bolivia i s divided into four cycles: initial, primary,
secondary, and higher education. Initial education, or preschool, begins at age five.
Primary education, covering eight years o f schooling i s compulsory for children aged six
to thirteen. I t i s subdivided into three cycles: grades one through three, grades four
through six, and grades seven and eight. Secondary education, subdivided into two cycles
o f two years each (grades nine to ten, and eleven to twelve), i s offered to students
fourteen to seventeen years old.

3.     Despite i t s status as one o f the poorest countries in Latin America, Bolivia has
made significant progress in expanding education access over the past few decades,
having obtained high primary enrollment and completion rates, placing i t on par with
wealthier neighbors, such as Brazil and Peru. As o f 2005, the primary net enrollment rate
in Bolivia had reached 94 percent o f children aged 6-13. Primary completion rates
increased from 71.5 percent in 2001 to 77.8 percent in 2005, and are estimated to reach
85.8 percent b y 2010, placing Bolivia o n track to achieve the Millennium Development
Goal (MDG) o f Universal Primary Completion.

4.      This progress aside, however, universal coverage in basic education remains a
challenge, especially among disadvantaged groups where dropout and repetition rates
remain high and learning achievement and access to secondary education are low.
Furthermore, the quality o f education has not kept pace with enrollments, and does not
compare as favorably with other Latin American countries as evidenced by participation
in both national (SIMECAL) and international (UNESCO's Latin American Laboratory
for Educational Quality Assessment (Laboratorio Latinoamericano de Evaluacio'n de la
Calidad de la Educacio'n-LLECE)        assessments. These evaluations also show large
differences in learning achievement between the lower and upper income quintiles.

5.      In addition, challenges in secondary education are growing. In contrast with high
enrollments for primary education, as recent as 2005, net enrollment in upper secondary
was only 58.9 percent. The combination o f greater access and increased completion at the
primary school level, combined with the population pressure from a greater cohort size,
has inevitably resulted in a higher demand for secondary schooling. Over the last ten
years, most o f this increase in secondary enrollment was seen in urban secondary schools,
which are characterized b y overcrowding, outdated curriculum and untrained teachers.
The quality o f secondary education cannot be overlooked as access to this level expands.

6.      Challenges in improving access to secondary school are compounded b y the tight
fiscal restrictions that in the past have made significantly increasing investment in
education unrealistic. During the last decade, Bolivia's public sector deficit was above 5
percent o f GDP, one o f the worst in South America. Despite these fiscal challenges, the
tables are slowly turning. Educational expenditures have been steadily climbing since
1995 from 3.5 percent to more than 6 percent o f GDP in 2005, which is just above the
benchmark suggested b y UNESCO (6 percent o f GDP). Furthermore, in the past year,
Bolivia has recorded a fiscal surplus o f approximately 4.87 percent, due mainly to the
new hydrocarbon policy, but also to an increase in tax collection efficiency. As a result o f
this improved situation, the education sector i s benefiting from a greater proportion o f the
national budget, and the country i s projected to invest just over 7 percent o f GDP in
education in the current calendar year.

Municipality o La Paz
              f

7.      L a Paz i s the administrative capital o f Bolivia and the country's third largest city.
The Municipality o f L a Paz occupies a total o f 2,012 km2 o f which 1,832 km2 are
classified as rural and 180 km2 as urban. L a Paz has a total population o f 793,293*
inhabitants with about 790,000 o f those living in urban areas (compared with only about
3,000 inhabitants in rural areas). About 35 percent o f L a Paz's population i s classified as
poor; overall about one quarter o f L a Paz's urban population (almost 200,000 people) are
thought to live in areas at risk with very limited access to basic services.

8.      Since the adoption o f the Popular Participation Law in 1994, Bolivia's education
system has undergone a process o f decentralization, leaving the bulk o f responsibility for
infrastructure and supplies in the hands o f the municipalities. As per the Popular
Participation Law, municipalities draw on taxes, revenue sharing, and HIF'C resources to
provide educational infrastructure and supplies, as well as basic necessities such as
electricity and water. Municipalities spend 81 percent o f their resources on physical
infrastructure and 19 percent on pedagogical materials and training.

9.       Within this mandate o f decentralization o f educational services, L a Paz is facing
i t s own distinct challenges. O n the one hand, the Education Reform Program o f the 1990s
has contributed to the achievement o f important goals in primary enrollment and
completion. In 2005, the primary net enrollment rate in L a Paz had reached 89.2 percent


 As per 2001 census.


                                               2
o f children aged 6-13 (gross enrollment rate for the same year was 97.8 percent).
Currently, only 4.2 percent o f children drop out o f primary school.

10.    On the other hand, despite the fact that L a Paz's population growth rate hovers
around a slow 0.1 percent per year, the demand for secondary education has risen
dramatically over the last decade, as have enrollments, which increased a total o f 18
percent between 1997 and 2005 in the public system (see Table 1 below). Serving more
than 7,000 more students than in the late 1990s, the Municipality has been able to meet
this demand only within the context o f overcrowding in some schools and a significant
increase in the student-teacher ratio from 21:l in 1997 to 27:l in 2005; meanwhile the
primary teacher-student ratio has been diminishing.

11.     What's more, these figures mask an uneven assignment o f teachers between
schools in the periphery and those in the center, which are marked by their high
concentration o f students-as     many as 60 students per teacher. As a whole, the
Municipality has a total o f 196 buildings housing 412 schools, or "educational units." O f
these 196 buildings, only three structures are dedicated solely t o secondary schooling,
while the majority o f secondary schools share buildings with primary and pre-primary
schools, resulting in an average o f 1.3 secondary schools operating per educational
structure, either simultaneously or in shifts. In terms o f the teaching force, in 2005, there
were 8,230 total teachers on the public record in the Municipality o f L a Paz, o f which
2,328, or 28 percent, served in secondary schools.

                           1999            20,748           20,854             4 1,602

                           200 1           20,302           20,786             41,088
                           2002            22,800           22,821             45,621
                           2003            23,463           23,112             46,575
                           2004            24,446           23,897             48,343
                           2005            24,066           23,677             47,743

12.     Despite growing enrollments in secondary education, a large number o f students
o f secondary age remain outside o f the system. The gross enrollment rate in secondary
education, while slowly increasing, i s s t i l l a l o w 67.7 percent, as compared to 97.8
percent in primary. In addition, 8.3 percent o f public secondary students drop out o f
school. The Municipality estimates i t s unmet demand at 40,465 students or about 45.7
percent o f the population o f secondary school age.3

13.     L a Paz schools also suffer from serious deficiencies in efficiency and quality as
indicated b y the net and gross enrollment rates as well as the percentage o f overage


 Unmet demand i s defined as marginality, or the population aged 14-17 that does not access public or
private secondary educational services.


                                                     3
students. According to 2005 data, in public secondary schools, the percentage o f female
students who are overage b y two or more years i s 21 percent; among males the number
reaches 27 percent. Furthermore, 12.4 percent o f students repeat.

14.     In summary, the main problems facing secondary education in L a Paz, are: i)
overcrowding and lack o f infrastructure; ii)o w enrollment and a large population o f out-
                                             l
of-school youth; (iii)high drop-out and repetition rates; (iv) l o w quality. In addition to
these challenges facing the municipality's education system, the O M D H does not have
significant experience designing, implementing or monitoring education policy that goes
beyond infrastructure. N o r do secondary schools have a history o f managing their own
resources.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

15.     At the country level, the World Bank has contributed both technically and
financially to the design and implementation o f the Primary Education Reform which was
implemented from 1994 to 2004. T w o projects supported by the Bank (1994 and 1998)
provided valuable resources for improving quality coverage at the basic education level.
These projects also contributed to improving the efficiency o f the education system
through decentralized actions strengthening local management and community
participation.

16.     The 2006 AAA, Basic Education in Bolivia: Challenges for 2006-2010 and
several national departmental consultation workshops have also identified the critical
need to transform secondary education in Bolivia in order to meet the growing demand
for this level o f schooling.

17.     In addition, the Bank has experience in decentralized support to municipalities
both inside and outside the education sector, through the Education Quality and Equity
Strengthening Project (PFCEE) and the current Urban Infrastructure Project. The
proposed project w i l l incorporate lessons learned from both projects. For instance, the
Municipal Educational Development Program, a core component o f the PFCEE, included
actions for supporting community participation activities in education processes at the
local level, which w i l l inform the proposed activities related to the Strengthening o f
Educational Communities and School Improvement Plans (SIPS). The SIMAF monitoring
information system that has been developed for the Urban Infrastructure Project w i l l be
also adapted to the proposed project.

18.      Finally, the Central Government, aware of the financial and technical role played
b y the Bank in the evolution o f the education system in Bolivia, supports the involvement
o f the Bank in this new program with the Municipality o f L a Paz (GMLP) and i t s Office
o f Human Development (OMDH) in strengthening i t s capacity to successfully meet i t s
obligations in the education ~ e c t o r . ~

 This project has been adapted from a Secondary Education Project prepared for the Government o f
Bolivia. Due to the change in administration and a reorganization o f the government through the Asamblea


                                                   4
3. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

19.     Between 2000 and 2005, Bolivia experienced a period o f extreme political
instability, characterized by riots, street blockades, strikes and massive mobilizations.
Over the last five years, Bolivia has been ruled by five presidents, two o f which were
forced to resign due to the social unrest. The political climate i s changing, however, and
the government has been presented with a unique window o f opportunity to build
consensus around i t s National Development Plan. For the first time in over forty years,
Bolivia has a government elected with a clear majority (54 percent o f voters) which also
has control o f Congress, hence presenting a greater possibility for moving forward with
policies to improve growth, social outcomes, and poverty reduction. At the same time,
the new government faces numerous challenges, among them a history o f ethnic
exclusion and some o f the highest levels o f poverty and inequality in Latin America.

20.        The project i s consistent with the overall objectives o f the 2006 Interim Strategy
Note (ISN) for Bolivia in that i t contributes to one o f the ISN's main priorities-that of
providing better services to the poor b y delivering higher quality education and health,
more transparent, accountable institutions, and decentralization o f service delivery. The
proposed project w i l l help in achieving these goals through three project components: (1)
access and permanence; (2) quality o f education; and (3) institutional strengthening. I t
w i l l provide increased access to and better quality o f secondary education, especially to
disadvantaged groups that often remain out o f school, repeat grades, or are at risk o f
dropping out. I t w i l l also strengthen the management capacity o f the Municipality's
Municipal Office o f Human Development (OMDH) b y supporting in the implementation,
monitoring, and evaluation o f the project. Finally, the proposed project w i l l strengthen
schools and school-level institutions in their ability to improve the quality and relevance
o f educational services.

21.      The proposed U S $ 10 million credit would last three and a half years, and would
support the Municipality o f L a Paz's activities in education within the larger municipal
framework o f education financing and responsibilities. Many aspects o f this project are
new to the Bolivia's work with the World Bank, and stand out for their level o f strategic
innovation. Notably are the decisions to work sub-nationally, to focus on the municipality
o f L a Paz, and to focus largely on the secondary level.

22.      The decision to work sub-nationally i s tied to the country's recent consolidation
o f a decentralized governance structure as per the 1994 Popular Participation Law, which,
among other things, distributed responsibility in the education sector among the national,
departmental, and municipal levels. Within this framework, this project represents a
unique opportunity to pioneer new activities and set a standard o f innovation in the areas
of access and quality that can be emulated b y other municipalities. This "demonstration
effect" may encourage other municipalities to replicate the successes o f L a Paz as they
continue to meet their obligations in the education sector. The project would also provide
municipal-level experience with new strategies that the central government i s considering

Constituyente, the Central Government opted to implement the project at the municipal level in L a Paz, and
to use the experience as model that can be replicated in other municipalities.


                                                    5
for implementation nationally. The Ministry o f Education and Culture has placed strong
support behind the project and anticipates leveraging lessons learned on a greater scale in
other municipalities across the country.

23.      The choice o f city for this project i s driven b y a number o f factors. First, as the
administrative capital o f the country and one o f the nation's largest cities, L a Paz i s a
very visible city, and one that i s likely to be emulated by other municipalities. Second, L a
Paz i s institutionally ready to undertake the challenge o f implementing a project o f this
size and scope, and i s able to absorb the costs financially. Moreover, the current mayor
took office in January 2005 for a period o f five years, and has strong support from the
central government, which gives the project the optimum chances o f obtaining a
successful and timely implementation and achieving results.

24.      The choice o f L a Paz was also motivated b y three goals: (i) poverty reduction:
addressing the high incidence o f poverty in one o f Bolivia's major urban centers b y
                                                               i)
enhancing this population's access to secondary education; ( igrowth: working with one
o f the country's main urban centers, as an engine o f growth, providing graduates with the
necessary tools for participation in the labor market, and the skills necessary to compete
in a global economy; and (iii)      participation: engaging directly with decentralized
institutions, schools and their surrounding communities in the planning, management,
monitoring and evaluation o f results in the education sector.

25.     Finally, both analytical work and social consultations carried out locally and
nationally, point to the need to transform the secondary level. While L a Paz has seen
many o f the benefits of the massive investment in primary education over the past
decade, i t s secondary system continues to lag behind in terms o f both coverage and
quality. The investment in secondary education proposed in this project i s the logical next
step for a system that has invested heavily in primary schooling.

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1. Lending instrument

26.     The proposed lending instrument for this operation i s a Specific Investment Loan
(SIL). The proposed S I L supports basic education with a focus on secondary education,
including activities related to access and quality, in the framework o f the specific
competencies that lie within the responsibilities o f the Municipality. The S I L w i l l also
strengthen institutional capacity o f the O M D H to design and carry out policy in the
education sector.

27.    In addition to the investment funds to be provided, the Bank w i l l also provide
technical assistance to enhance the delivery o f secondary education.

2. Project development objective and key indicators

28.    The project development objective i s to support the Municipal Government's
education strategy, by: (i)
                          increasing access to secondary education for adolescents and


                                               6
young people and improving their permanence in the education system; (ii)      improving
quality and relevance o f primary and secondary education; and (iii)    strengthening the
decentralized education management capacity o f the Municipality o f L a Paz.

29.    Progress towards achieving these project objectives w i l l be monitored through: (i)
a management and monitoring information system (SIMAF) currently in use b y the
Municipality o f L a Paz, that w i l l be adapted to the needs o f the O M D H to help them in
monitoring the indicators defined for the project; (ii) impact evaluation carried out by

3. Project components

32.     The project consists o f three components: (i)
                                                     Access and Permanence, focusing on
improving access to secondary schooling and improving promotion and completion rates
at the late primary and secondary school levels; this component focuses o n getting new
students into the education system, and ensuring that all students in the system stay in
school through the end o f secondary; (ii)  Quality o f Education, aimed at improving the
quality o f public basic education (primary and secondary) for all students in the system;
and (iii)Education Management and Institutional Strengthening, directed at strengthening
the education management capacity o f the GMLP and the OMDH.

33.      The targeted municipal districts for new and improved infrastructure have been
chosen according to two main selection criteria: (i) index o f unsatisfied demand as
                                                       an
determined b y the number o f marginalized (out o f school) youth in each Educational
District; and (ii)  prevalence o f overcrowding. Otherwise, all nine municipal macro-
districts (23 districts) w i l l benefit from the project according to criteria for each
subcomponent .

35.    Component 1: Access and Permanence. This component supports the efforts o f
the O M D H to promote expanded coverage in secondary education (grades 9 through 12)
and completion in the upper primary (grades 7 and 8) and early secondary grades by: (i)
increasing the number o f available secondary schooling places b y 19,600, representing 41
percent o f current enrollment; (ii)increasing secondary completion rates o f
approximately 5,130 students at risk o f educational failure, defined as having two or
more years of age/grade distortion.

       Subcomponent 1.1: Educational Infrastructure and Equipment. This
       subcomponent aims to increase the availability o f student places and improve the
       physical conditions o f secondary schools by constructing four schools and
       expanding 135 existing schools. Three schools w i l l be built on new sites, and one
       w i l l be built on an existing site. The Municipality has established that all land
       designated for construction pertain to the Municipality, and as such n o
       resettlement w i l l be necessary. Furthermore, all land titles are in place and all
       architectural plans have been drawn up.

       The project will finance: (i)     the new construction and equipping o f four
       educational infrastructures (95 classrooms) creating 7,600 new school places (40
                                               i)
       students per classroom in two turns); ( ithe new construction and equipping o f
       approximately 150 classrooms creating 12,000 new school places (40 students per
       classroom in two turns). This subcomponent w i l l create a total o f 19,600 new


                                                9
       secondary places, which b y 2010 are expected to be filled by 4,560 new students,
       increasing enrollment by 9.4 percent, as well as b y students transferring from
       overcrowded schools and classrooms.

       Subcomponent 1.2: Incentive Program for Students at Risk of Education
       Failure. This subcomponent aims to create an incentive program serving 5,130
       students in the targeted districts at risk o f dropping out. At-risk students are
       identified as those exhibiting two or more years o f age/grade distortion in grades
       seven and eight o f primary, and one and two o f secondary.

       Under this subcomponent, the project w i l l finance the development o f an
       intervention providing direct pedagogical support to these at-risk students to
       ensure that they remain in the education system to complete their primary and
       secondary studies and improve their critical thinking and communication skills.
       The pedagogical support w i l l consist o f a targeted supplementary academic and
       skills-building course provided b y pedagogical experts and offered after school or
       as a complement to the school day. These experts w i l l in some cases be contracted
       by the Municipality, and in other cases w i l l function out o f institutions already
       providing such services in L a Paz. This subcomponent w i l l draw on existing
       materials and programs wherever possible, and has been designed to leverage
       additional donor funding should i t become available.

36.      Component 2: Quality of Education. This component supports efforts b y the
Municipality to improve the quality o f basic education with a focus on secondary
education. The quality component concentrates primarily on two activities: the
rehabilitation o f dilapidated educational infrastructure and the development o f a program
that strengthens educational communities through School Improvement Plans (SIPS) and
direct financial transfers to Education Management Committees to fund these plans. This
component also includes interventions to promote awareness o f transversal themes and
centralized provision o f academic resources b y establishing partnerships to create
Pedagogic Resource Platforms (PRPs). The four subcomponents are described below in
more detail.

       Subcomponent 2.1: Improvement o Educational Learning Environments. This
                                         f
       subcomponent aims to improve learning environments through the renovation and
       reconstruction o f educational infrastructure and the implementation o f an
       experimental maintenance program. In specific, this subcomponent w i l l finance:
       (i) reconstruction and equipping o f three dilapidated school buildings (totaling
          the
                         i)
       63 classrooms); ( iimplementation o f an experimental maintenance program that
       manages the maintenance o f school buildings through three alternative
       mechanisms that vary according to the size and complexity o f the c i v i l works: (a)
       strengthening the current centralized approach for smaller works; (b)
       subcontracting with the private sector for larger works; and (c) carrying out
       maintenance awareness-raising campaigns in schools coupled with semi-annual
       School Improvement Days for daily maintenance and care.




                                            10
Subcomponent 2.2: Awareness-Raising Programs on Transversal Themes. The
objective o f this subcomponent i s to contribute to the development o f civic values
and attitudes within the educational community. This component consists o f the
design and delivery o f simple awareness programs for 1,084 teachers, 81 school
directors, and 792 representatives from the Juntas EscoZares (educational
councils) on transversal topics defined b y the Municipality, including: democracy,
gender equity, health and sexuality, environment, multiculturalism, and life skills.
The project w i l l finance: (i) publication o f a small series o f booklets covering
                               the
                                                            i)
the transversal themes and their use in the classroom; ( iworkshops for teachers,
administrators, and parents addressing the above issues; and (iii)    development o f
an interactive website for use b y teachers, directors, parents and students.

Subcomponent 2.3: Pedagogical Resource Platforms (PRPs). Through this
innovative subcomponent, the Municipality w i l l enter into partnerships with
educational institutions (NGOs, research institutes, training organizations, etc.)
with the space, capacity and experience to house and run up to seven Pedagogic
Resource Platforms (PRPs) in service o f neighboring schools and the community,
or which can also benefit from additional equipment to make such centers
operational. Partnership between the private sector and the public sector i s critical
for the success o f this intervention. The PRPs w i l l act as multi-service educational
centers providing access to science and computer labs, learning materials, and as a
central hub that could potentially integrate various activities within the proposed
project, such as awareness-raising workshops and pedagogical reinforcement to
at-risk students. This subcomponent has been designed to leverage additional
donor funding should i t become available.

The subcomponent w i l l finance two types o f PRP models, depending on the
institutional arrangements with the potential partner: (i)   provision o f a subgrant
directly to the partner institution to purchase equipment and to finance operation
                      i)
o f the PRPs; and, ( ipurchase o f equipment and materials b y the Municipality
which are then transferred to the partner institution for their use in the PRPs.

Subcomponent 2.4: Strengthening of Educational Communities. This
subcomponent, which i s meant to make a significant contribution toward
improving the quality o f primary and secondary education, provides direct
financing to schools to create and implement annual school-level strategic plans
called School Improvement Plans (SIPS). I t i s based on the idea that school-based
management brings decision-making closer to stakeholders and permits stronger
social accountability, thus allowing for a greater chance o f improving the quality
and relevance o f investments. I t also contributes to the strengthening o f the
capacity o f school-level actors such as school directors and Juntas EscoZares-
school councils established under the previous educational reform-thereby
breaking the cycle o f centralized school management and administration.

The subcomponent w i l l finance: (i)
                                    training and support to school management
committees (Equipos de Gestihn Educativa) in the development o f School



                                      11
       Improvement Plans (SIPs), including development o f a manual outlining the basic
                                                          i)
       steps for developing and implementing SIPs; and ( ifinancing o f SIPS by a direct
       per-capita yearly transfer b y the Municipality to at least 137 o f a total o f 196
       primary and secondary schools.

       Guidelines for financing categories have been set out in the operational manual
       and w i l l be included in the SIP manual. They are focused primarily on
       interventions for improving educational quality, including: (i)preservation and/or
       improvement o f educational infrastructure; ( iequipment; (iii)
                                                      i)                 interventions to
       improve teaching/learning processes; (iv) operational costs; and (v) fulfillment o f
       the goals o f the Municipality's on-going school maintenance program, Operucidn
       Cole, by keeping schools clean and well-maintained. Guidelines for the
       Operucidn Cole program are already established and include: keeping the fasade
       clean and well cared for, preserving the windows and furniture, cleaning the
       classrooms and patios, cleaning and maintaining the bathrooms, and appropriate
       disposal o f litter.

       Throughout the life o f the project, at least 960 SIPs w i l l be developed and at least
       41 1 w i l l be financed and implemented. The amount o f the financial transfers w i l l
       vary between $1.47 and $2.68 per student depending on whether the school has
       fulfilled the requirements o f the Operucidn Cole program. This amount was
       established according to available funds in the project, and according to the
       Municipality's ability to sustain the SIP program after the end o f the project cycle.
       Transfers w i l l take place once a year for three years to schools who have
       developed SIPs according to the established criteria and approved by the
       OMDH's Unit o f Educational and Pedagogical Services (UGESP).

37.      Component 3: Education Management and Institutional Strengthening. This
component aims to strengthen management capacity at the municipal and school levels to
facilitate actions to improve access to and completion and quality o f secondary education.
In line with the country's decentralized education system, the project w i l l involve the
Municipality as a key actor in education management in a manner that enhances, but does
not overlap with the responsibilities o f the Ministry. The objective o f this component w i l l
be achieved through the four subcomponents described below:

       Subcomponent 3.1: Management and Monitoring Information System. This
       subcomponent aims to strengthen the education management and monitoring
       information system o f the Municipality, particularly the OMDH. The project w i l l
       finance: (i) adaptation o f SIMAF, an existing management and monitoring
                   the
                                                                                i)
       information system that w i l l track relevant indicators and outputs; ( iprovision o f
       equipment, materials, and consultants necessary for carrying out project
       management and implementation; and ( i )      i i contracting o f auditing services to
       carry out annual project audits.
       Subcomponent 3.2: Impact Evaluation. The project will finance the design and
       implementation o f an evaluation o f the Secondary Education Transformation
       Project to measure the program effects and impacts. The impact evaluation w i l l be


                                              12
carried out b y an external consulting firm with expertise in evaluation, and w i l l be
co-financed b y a Japan PHRD grant, which w i l l be used for the gathering o f
baseline data. The methodology o f the impact evaluation w i l l consist o f
comparing the project impact indicators in the Municipality o f L a Paz with the
same indicators in three other comparable municipalities that do not have the
intervention. The goal o f the evaluation i s to determine whether the project
interventions affect the impact indicators enough to differentiate L a Paz from
municipalities that did not have such interventions. Detailed terms o f reference
have already been developed for both the baseline and the impact evaluation.
Subcomponent 3.3: Institutional Strengthening o OMDH. As the Municipality
                                                    f
moves towards the full implementation o f the SIL, this component w i l l focus on
improving its capacity to enhance i t s financial and accounting practices, revising
i t s procurement and financial management norms in accordance with international
standards, and carrying out other activities related to improving the OMDH's
performance in the education sector. In particular, the project w i l l support: (i)
                                                                                   the
purchasing o f equipment and furniture for the OMDH; (ii)                 professional
                                         i i the
development for the OMDH; and ( i ) design and implementation o f an
informational campaign publicizing the project and i t s activities.
Subcomponent 3.4: Assessment o           f Student Learning Progress. This
subcomponent aims to develop a school-level student progress assessment to be
administered twice a year to all students in their second year o f secondary
schooling in the areas o f math and language. This innovative assessment system
w i l l be designed and systematized centrally (at the municipal level), but
administered and corrected b y the teachers themselves, thus acting as both a
student assessment and a teacher training exercise. This low-stakes testing serves
the purpose of providing a learning barometer for the Municipality, school
directors, and teachers without duplicating the higher-stakes accountability and
assessment function held by the Ministry o f Education. I t also contributes to
developing a culture o f evaluation among teachers and in the educational
community. Teachers w i l l be interviewed about their experiences with the
assessment process, and results w i l l be publicized in order to socialize lessons
learned and support efforts to evaluate teaching and learning in general.

The project w i l l finance an external consultancy that will: (i)        design the
                 i)
assessments; ( i train teachers and school directors in test administration and
evaluation; (iii) organize the logistics o f test preparation and administration; and
(iv) interpret and systematize test results.




                                      13
4. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design

38.    Two projects supported b y the Bank (1994, 1998) in Bolivia provided valuable
resources for improving quality coverage at the basic education level. Lessons learned
from these projects as well as from other countries in Latin America, particularly Chile,
Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil, have been incorporated in the project.

39.     Lessons learned that benefit the design and are reflected in this project include the
following: (i)                                 i)
               targeting at-risk students; ( i implementing changes gradually; (iii)
exploring innovative modalities o f improving and measuring learning; (iv) incorporating
mechanisms that strengthen schools and community participation in education; (v)
promoting activities that integrate quality, access and retention within the institutional
competencies of the implementing body, in this case the Municipality; (vi) incorporating
measures to mitigate corruption in the area o f c i v i l works; and, (vii) working on
secondary education programs at the sub-national level.

40.     Targeting at-risk students. This project draws on experiences providing
pedagogical support to and promoting accelerated flow o f at-risk students in Brazil and
Colombia, which have met with considerable success. At-risk students in these countries
have benefited from targeted programs that emphasize basic s k i l l s and package key
learning objectives into reduced lessons that are offered parallel or complementary to the
regular school day. Furthermore, research from the region shows that investing in
vulnerable students often has proportionately larger results in student learning that does
investing in the middle or top o f the income or achievement distribution.

41.     Implementing changes gradually. Over-ambitious reforms that try t o solve all
problems in one shot have adverse effects during project implementation and on the
achievement o f concrete results. This may lead to delays and constant changes and
adjustments to the project implementation targets and schedules. This project has been
conceived as a closely-coupled set o f activities that complement funding from other
sources while taking into account the decentralization framework currently in place in
Bolivia. In addition, the proposed activities for financing comprise a tight package o f
interventions that both benefit from international best practice and reflect local realities
with regards to urgent needs, implementation capacity, and political viability. To increase
the likelihood o f achieving the expected impact, the project has a simple design that
includes: (i) focused objective with a small number o f components; (ii) simple project
             a                                                                a
            i imeasurable monitoring and impact indicators; and (iv) alignment with the
structure; ( i )
existing priorities o f the Municipality o f L a Paz, and thus, significant commitment o f the
main authorities and technical teams to the project.

42.     Exploring innovative modalities to improve and measure student learning in
secondary education. The project design draws on international experience with
innovative modalities for improving and assessing student learning locally, in such a way
that does not overlap with the roles and responsibilities o f the Ministry o f Education in
the area o f student assessment.



                                             14
43.     Incorporating mechanisms that promote community participation in education.
Both Bolivian and international experience show that greater school control over some
management decisions appear to be related to higher student performance. Furthermore,
including parents and communities in school-level decision making can increase
efficiency, accountability and school quality. Experience from Mexico, Brazil, and
Central America shows that parental participation in education management can be both
effective and cost efficient. Even small investments that contribute to community
participation in school management can produce positive results in student learning. This
project design draws on such experiences in i t s incorporation o f school-based initiatives
that can improve education quality.

44.     Promoting activities that integrate quality, access and retention within the
institutional competencies of the Municipality. Although, within the legal context o f
Bolivia, the Municipality has primary responsibility for education infrastructure and
supplies, the project draws on the understanding that promoting improved access to and
quality o f education depends on more than providing educational infrastructure and
materials. As a result, this project integrates a number o f simple initiatives for improving
access and quality that s t i l l lie with the domain o f the Municipality, and that they have
the capacity to implement.

45.        Mitigating corruption in civil works. This project incorporates a number o f
lessons learned from the two previous basic education projects carried out in Bolivia in
the 1990s regarding corruption in civil works. First, the project will not be working with
the FPS to implement the two infrastructure subcomponents as i t has in the past, due to
previous irregularities with the FPS and i t s use o f funds. I t w i l l instead implement all
c i v i l works directly through the OMDH's Unit o f Infrastructure and Equipment (UIE),
with the assistance o f outside supervision. Second, the OMDH has developed its own
anti-corruption strategy specifically for this project. Finally, over the past few years, the
Municipality has advanced significantly with the development o f its own internal audit
unit for the review o f civil works. As part o f the effort to strengthen the internal control
environment, the internal audit unit has been staffed with specialized technical personnel
able to perform physical evaluations o f c i v i l works before they are completed. The
purpose o f such reviews i s to verify compliance w i t h technical specifications and
contracts, to assess the quality o f the work, and to verify consistency between financial
and physical progress.

46.      Working with secondary education at the sub-national level. Experience with
sub-national secondary education projects in Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina has
demonstrated not only the potential impact o f these interventions, but also the importance
o f ensuring that they are strongly aligned with national policies. Whenever sub-national
interventions have not complemented (or have overlapped with) national policies, their
sustainability i s at very high risk, and the possibility o f adequately measuring their impact
i s greatly diminished.




                                              15
5. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

47.     Centralized vs. decentralized quality interventions. Experience in Latin America
has shown that devolving management o f some school resources to the school level i s
often more effective than centralized control of such resources. The participation o f
schools in their own management brings decision-making closer to stakeholders and
permits stronger social accountability, thus allowing for a greater chance o f improving
the quality and relevance o f investments. Consequently, this project has chosen to
decentralize some decision-making capacities to the school level so that schools can
prioritize their own needs.

48.     Creating new PRPs vs. developing partnerships for PRP implementation.
Experience in Latin America with centralized provision o f materials and equipment
(textbooks, computers, science laboratories, etc.) through such initiatives as pedagogical
resource centers or similar programs have shown that such models o f service provision
can lead to inequities in the system and rarely result in across-the-board improvements in
students' learning. Furthermore, due to lack o f funding for maintenance, such institutions
often fall into disrepair and disuse. As such, this project has opted for creating
partnerships with pre-existing community-based and educational organizations that can
bring their own space, expertise, and materials and ensure sustainability past project
completion, and who are already invested in serving their communities. Such
organizations can promote equity o f access and use, as well as run and maintain the
PRPs.

49.     Demand side financing vs. school-based compensation to promote permanence
and completion. Mechanisms have to be in place to ensure that students are enrolling in
and completing their secondary schooling. Conditional Cash Transfers were considered
as one option for encouraging enrollments and permanence in the system; however, the
idea was discarded due to a lack o f solid experience using CCTs with the secondary
school population, as well as the complexity of instituting such a system for a small
number o f students at the municipal level. Instead this project proposes an alternative
intervention o f direct pedagogical support targeting students at risk o f dropping out.
Building on the recent Bolivian experience o f the Juancito Pinto cash transfer program,
however, i t i s possible that this transfer may be expanded, with technical adaptations, to
benefit economically disadvantaged secondary school students.

50.      Comprehensive evaluation system vs. student progress assessment. Although the
former national assessment, SIMECAL, has been discontinued since 2000, this project
opted not to develop a comprehensive high-stakes system at the municipal level due to
the potential expense and possibility o f eventual overlap with higher-stakes evaluation
initiatives at the Ministry level. Instead the project w i l l support a lower-stakes municipal
level student progress assessment, to be developed centrally and administered and
corrected by teachers with the objective o f strengthening teacher capacity and creating a
culture o f evaluation.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnership arrangements

51.      While the World Bank i s not directly pooling resources with other donors, the
proposed project has been strategically designed to complement the work o f the
government and international donors in the sector by supporting objectives defined and
prioritized b y the Municipality. Both the World Bank and other donors are supporting the
Municipal Development Plan (Plan de Desarrollo Municipal--JAYMA) through different
mechanisms o f funding and through different activities established in the Annual
Operational Plan (POA), defined and managed under the leadership o f the Municipality
o f L a Paz. The preparation process o f the Secondary Education Transformation Project i s
financed through a Japanese Grant (PHRD) TF 53 15 1, whose closing date was extended
up to October 16,2007.

52.     Two o f the subcomponents in particular, 1.2 Incentive Program for Students at
Risk o f Education Failure, and 2.3 Pedagogical Resource Platform Collaborations, have
been designed in such a way to allow room for additional donor participation that could
expand their scope and impact. The Municipality i s open to participation from other
donors provided that the scope o f the project stays within i t s capacity for implementation.

53.    Table 4 below outlines the Municipality's expenditure in education for the years
2004 to 2006, breaking down the various public and private funding sources. Funding
from the World Bank would supplement this budget b y roughly Bs. 15.3 million for
2007, Bs. 39.4 million for 2008, and Bs. 25.2 million for 2009.

54.     Finally, some project subcomponents, such as the School Improvement Plans, in
which schools receive financial transfers directly from the municipality, and the Student
Progress Assessments, have been designed in such a way that the Municipality w i l l be
able to streamline their recurring costs into i t s budget following project completion.

Institutional arrangements

55.    The Mayor's office o f L a Paz i s the highest decision making body within the
municipal government. I t i s responsible for promoting and advancing sustainable,
equitable and participatory human development within the municipality through the
formulation and implementation o f policies, plans, programs and projects in accordance
with departmental and national development plans.

56.     The Municipal Office o f Human Development (Oficialia Mayor de Desarrollo
Hurnano-OMDH) is the technical body responsible for carrying out the municipality's
obligations in human development. I t i s made up o f four offices: Education, Health,
Citizen's Rights and Sports, and two special units: Citizen Security and Infrastructure,
which together carry out local policies.

57.    With the inception o f Bolivia's decentralization policy, which began in 1994, the
Municipality o f L a Paz prioritized i t s interventions in the area o f education, especially in
the provision o f physical infrastructure, i t s construction, renovation, maintenance,
equipping, and furnishing, as well as provision o f learning materials, and the supervision
and administration o f their use.

58.        Within the scope o f the responsibilities accorded the municipality, the O M D H
w i l l be directly responsible for the execution o f the Secondary Education Transformation
Project in the Municipality o f L a Paz, through the Office o f Education and the Unit o f
Infrastructure and Equipment (UIE), coordinating with the other technical bodies within
the Municipality. The Municipality w i l l inform the Ministry o f Education regarding the
activities and goals o f the Project.

Implementationarrangements

59.     All project activities w i l l be implemented by the Municipality o f L a Paz (GMLP)
through the Municipal Office o f Human Development (OMDH), which w i l l have
responsibility for overall design, management, supervision, coordination, technical and
fiduciary control, and monitoring and evaluation. Implementation w i l l be executed in
accordance with the Operational Manual which has already been developed by the
OMDH. The Manual details the operational procedures and institutional arrangements
related to project implementation.

60.     The organizational structure defined for project implementation i s being designed
based on the structure o f the GMLP passed through the Municipal Ordinance No      867/06
issued b y the OMDH, which defines the relation and coordination with other units o f the
GMLP as presented in




                                               18
Figure 1 o f Annex 6.

61.     The GMLP units that w i l l be operationally supporting the implementation o f the
Project are placed at the directional level o f the Municipality (Mayor) and in specialized
technical units that w i l l give support to the overall project management-the Executive
Secretariat and the units that work under this branch office:

a) The Special Office o f Finances w i l l support the financial management activities and
   payment processes;
b) The Office o f Planning and Control w i l l contribute to the monitoring o f technical and
   administrative project activities through i t s specific M&E system;
c) The Office o f Bidding and'contracts w i l l provide support for procurement processes;
d) The Office for the Oversight o f Works and Services w i l l support the c i v i l works
   inspection processes.

62.    In addition, the Environmental Quality Office, which works under the Municipal
Technical Office, w i l l contribute to implementation through supervision o f c i v i l works
and mitigation o f any negative externalities generated through project implementation.

63.      Because this project w i l l not have an independent Project Implementation Unit, as
an underlying objective o f this effort i s to build the Municipality's capacity to administer
efficiently i t s education services network, the Municipal Office o f Human Development
(OMDH) w i l l have the overall responsibility for the coordination o f project
implementation. Day-to-day implementation w i l l be the responsibility o f the relevant
staff o f the O M D H at all levels, under the direction o f the Head Human Development
Officer (Oficial Mayor de Desarrollo Humano) who will report to the Executive
Secretariat o f the GMLP and o f the Mayor o f L a Paz.

64.     The O M D H i s responsible for the political and strategic definition in education,
health, c i v i l rights, sports and c i v i l security. The O M D H has a Unit o f Infrastructure and
Equipment (UIE) for Human Development, which w i l l be responsible o f the execution o f
the Access and Permanence component. I t also has an Administrative and Financial
Center which w i l l be responsible for managing the resources, together with the Special
Office o f Finances o f the GMLP and in close coordination with the Planning Unit o f the
Municipality. Figure 2 in Annex 6 presents the organizational structure o f the OMDH.
Units responsible for oversight and implementation are highlighted.

65.     Within the OMDH, responsibilities for each component w i l l be as follows:

        Component I,Access and Permanence, w i l l be carried out by two different bodies
        within the Municipality. The infrastructure activities w i l l be the responsibility of
        the Unit o f Infrastructure and Equipment (UIE), and activities related to
        incentives for at-risk students w i l l be the responsibility o f the Municipal Office o f
        Education's Unit o f Educational and Pedagogical Services (UGESP).

       Within Component 2, Improvement o Quality, activities related to infrastructure
                                                  f
       and the improvement o f educational environments w i l l be the responsibility o f the
       UIE. All other activities w i l l be the responsibility o f UGESP.

       Component 3, Strengthening Decentralized Education Management, w i l l be the
       responsibility o f three bodies. The information and monitoring system will be the
       responsibility of the Administrative and Financial Center o f the OMDH. The
       impact evaluation and institutional strengthening activities w i l l take place through
       the OMDH, and the student progress assessment w i l l be the responsibility o f
       UGESP.

Flow of Funds

66.    The Republic o f Bolivia (recipient) represented b y the Ministry o f Finance and
the Ministry o f Planning w i l l transfer the credit proceeds to the Municipality o f L a Paz
through a Subsidiary Agreement, under the same IDA financing conditions. Such an
agreement w i l l establish the Municipality's responsibility for overall project
implementation through i t s Municipal Office o f Human Development (OMDH).

67.     The project's financial management tasks w i l l be undertaken by the OMDH's
Administrative and Finance Unit (CAF), in close coordination with the Office o f
Planning and Control and the Special Office o f Finances for programming and treasury
issues, respectively.

68.     T o facilitate project implementation, a segregated Designated Account w i l l be
opened and maintained in the Central Bank o f Bolivia in the name o f the project. This
account would be managed b y the O M D H through the CAF, which would then have
direct access to funds advanced b y the Bank to this DA. Funds deposited into the DA as
advances would then be transferred to a specific Libreta in local currency opened within
the Single Municipal Account, from which payments for project expenditures would be
made, through the Municipal Treasury, following the established mechanism.

3. Monitoring and evaluation

69.     During the last decade, a comprehensive national evaluation system (SIMECAL)
was established with the original idea o f making systematic use o f the available
information. Local capacity was strengthened and as a result the country has seen a
significant improvement in conducting evaluations, tracking monitoring indicators and
basic statistics needed for education planning. Unfortunately, despite these achievements,
the assessment system was discontinued. The ME i s currently in process o f reinitiating
assessment activities through a quality measurement system called Observatorio de la
Calidad de la Educacidn.

70.    Project monitoring w i l l be carried out periodically and systematically b y the
O M D H with the support o f an adaptation o f the SIMAF monitoring and information
software used in the Urban Infrastructure Project--Barrios de Verdad. Indicators of



                                             20
project implementation have been defined, and w i l l be reviewed semi-annually to
evaluate progress in implementation. Furthermore, an impact evaluation, carried out by
an external institution, w i l l measure previously identified impact indicators (see Annex 3
for all project indicators). Finally, yearly financial and procurement audits w i l l be carried
out b y external auditing firms.

71.    Monitoring o f the infrastructure subcomponents w i l l be carried out b y three
independent external supervisors working under the auspices o f the O M D H .

4. Sustainability

72.    As each municipality in Bolivia receives revenue sharing from the central
government, including hydrocarbon (IDH), co-participation, and HIPC revenues, the
municipal government has, in principle, the resources and demonstrated capacity to
support education.

73.     In addition, the G M L P has expressed i t s commitment to maintaining and
continuing certain aspects o f the project after funding completion. These include: the
maintenance o f new and renovated infrastructure, continued assessment o f student
learning progress, support for the PRPs, the student incentive program, and the program
for strengthening school communities, including the financial transfers funding the SIPs.
The continuity o f the mentioned activities w i l l ensure sustainability to the Project.

Evidence of borrower's commitment

74.    The Bolivian Government, through the Ministry o f Planning and Development
has stated its commitment to the project and has manifested i t s support to the
Municipality o f L a Paz for the project's financing and implementation. The Ministry o f
Education and Culture has also demonstrated its strong support for the project and i s
anticipating promoting the project as a model for use in other municipalities.

75.     The Municipality o f L a Paz has demonstrated i t s commitment to executing the
project within its own structure, with the help o f technical assistance o f consultants,
without establishing a project implementation unit. Furthermore, the GMLP has
expressed i t s interest in establishing processes in such a way that can be continued after
funding ends. As such, project subcomponents have been designed in such a way that the
Municipality w i l l be able to streamline their recurring costs into its budget following
project completion. For instance, for the School Improvement Projects (SIPS), the
Municipality opted to lower the per-capita amount for financial transfers in favor of
defining an amount that would realistically be carried over into the education budget after
project completion.

 78.     The final impacts o f the project w i l l include more young people having access to,
 enrolling in, and staying in school through graduation. Students w i l l learn more while
 they are in school and fewer students are expected to repeat or drop out. The economic
 benefits w i l l be directly linked to increased student flow, and w i l l result in increased
 earning potential for future graduates, as well as the option to attend higher education,



                                                  23
which creates a possibility for even better earning potential. The costs o f the project
include the direct costs of project implementation, the indirect recurrent costs o f teacher
and administrative pay, and the economic costs o f forgone income and the costs of higher
education, both to students and to the state.

79.      Direct project impacts were estimated using a student flow model which includes
school construction and upgrading, as well as the enhanced student flow associated with
the initiatives to mitigate dropout and improve quality. According to these estimations,
which are represented in Table 5 below, gross secondary enrollment i s likely to reach 75
percent in 2010 without the project, but should increase to 79 percent with this project,
which w i l l assure secondary education for 2,986 additional youths per year. Moreover,
the project should generate a reduction in the secondary dropout rate b y 2 additional
percent points and an increase in the gross secondary completion rate b y almost 2
additional percent points.

Financial and sustainability analysis summary

8 1.    Tax revenues increased from 26 percent o f GDP in 2005 to 33 percent o f GDP in
2006, mainly due to the new hydrocarbon policy, but also because o f an increase in tax
collection efficiency. In addition, public expenditures were contained generating a fiscal
surplus. Furthermore, Bolivia benefited from the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI), reducing i t s external debt from about 50 percent o f GDP to close to 20 percent.
The Municipality o f L a Paz i s the only municipality to have a formal r i s k assessment.
According to Fitch, L a Paz i s rated as A (bol) with a stable outlook (January 2007), due
to cautious financial management, a decreasing debt-to-income ratio (income increased
40 percent between 2001 and 2005), and a propitious economic environment in both the
municipality and the department.

82.      In this context, both the Central Government as well as the Municipality w i l l have
enough resources to cover the new obligations triggered by this project. Teachers and
other personnel to be hired w i l l cost the Central Government Bs 1.5 million in wages and
bonuses each year, representing a small fraction o f the total cost o f current education
investments (about 7 percent o f GDP). The new infrastructure w i l l require maintenance
and service provision covered b y the municipality. Nevertheless, the total recurrent cost
to be covered b y the municipality represents less than 40 percent o f the total cost linked
to this project.

2. Technical

83.     The technical studies in the sector include the Bank's sector work (AAA) recently
finalized, diagnostic work conducted b y education experts, a municipal-wide consultation
process involving key stakeholders, and a national-level consultation on the state o f
education in the country. In addition, the project takes into account the Municipal
Development Plan for 2007-201 1 and the Annual Operational Plan (POA) for the GMLP


                                             25
and the O M D H and provides an appropriate technical response to the needs o f the
education system in L a Paz within the competencies o f the GMLP. The project has
benefited greatly from the incorporation o f successful technical and administrative
practices, from within the Municipality, Bolivia, and the region. The project interventions
have been assessed from an educational perspective and correspond to best international
experience.

3. Fiduciary

Financial Management (see Annex 7)

84.    As part o f the preparation process for the Secondary Education Transformation
Project for the Municipality o f L a Paz, a financial management assessment was
performed to determine the adequacy o f the financial management arrangements o f the
G M L P and O M D H to properly manage and account for all project proceeds, and to
produce timely, accurate, and reliable financial statements for general and Bank special
purposes. The assessment was performed in accordance with O P B P 10.02 and the
manual "Financial Management Practices in World Bank Financed Investment
Operations".

85.     Recognizing the progress the GMLP has achieved in strengthening i t s financial
management systems, the project w i l l use the GMLP's existing financial structure,
systems and other arrangements to the extent possible. However, project design and
implementation arrangements also require that these existing arrangements be
strengthened so as to mitigate the associated risks and some weaknesses identified that
may prevent the implementing entity from providing the Bank, the Borrower, and other
interested parties with accurate and timely information regarding project resources,
expenditures, and activities. At the time o f the assessment, the required financial
management system was in the process o f being adapted from the Urban Infrastructure
Project. However, this assessment was updated during the appraisal mission held in July,
2007.

86.     As o f the date o f the appraisal, several actions have been taken towards
strengthening the financial management system. In relation to the FM arrangements for
School Improvement Plans Sub-component, general processes and procedures have been
agreed. However, further refining i s s t i l l required, in addition to the definition o f the
financial agreements and financial reports at the school level.               Regarding the
installment/adaptation o f the financial management system (SIMAF), there are s t i l l some
pending actions related to the issuance o f the interim financial reports and recording o f
the School Improvement Plans Sub-component.

87.     In view o f the significant progress reached so far and subject t o the successful
completion o f the actions mentioned above, the Financial Management Team concludes
that the arrangement proposed for the implementation o f the project by the O M D H can be
considered acceptable.




                                              26
Procurement (see Annex 8)

88.       Procurement for the project w i l l be the responsibility o f the O M D H . The O M D H
w i l l carry out the major procurement for all components, including larger items such as
works, large consultancies, goods, such as equipment, and will evaluate and supervise the
procurement carried out under subprojects (School Improvement Plans). The
procurement for the SIP subprojects w i l l include works, goods, and services to improve
the quality o f basic education under Component 2 o f the project.

89.     An assessment o f the OMDH's capacity has been performed, indicating a high
risk rating. An action plan has been prepared to address the risks that were identified.
Both the Bank and the Borrower agreed on this plan on March, 2007. I t is expected to be
fully implemented between negotiations and loan signature. The Bank's supervision plan
addresses the risks identified b y proposing biannual procurement ex-post reviews o f the
entire project for the first year. The subprojects w i l l be subject to annual independent
procurement reviews to be subcontracted by OMDH.

4. Environment

90.     The project has been classified under Category B as i t w i l l finance the
construction o f schools andor the addition or rehabilitation o f classrooms, bathrooms and
other facilities in existing sites.

91.      The Municipality has established that all land designated for construction, and all
facilities designated for reconstruction pertain to the Municipality, and as such no
resettlement w i l l be necessary. Furthermore, all land titles are in place and all
architectural plans have been drawn up.

92.     n
       I preparation for the proposed project, and in line with World Bank
requirements, the Municipality carried out an environmental assessment to identify
potential environmental impacts and to design appropriate measures for mitigating such
impacts. They highlighted the following considerations.

93.      Technical Considerations. I terms of the technical aspects o f the project, the
                                       n
assessment defines all o f the distinct activities related to construction and renovation o f a
total o f 308 classrooms and the demolition o f existing units. These have enabled the
GMLP to develop a Program for Prevention and Mitigation (PPM) and Plan for the
Application o f Environmental Monitoring (PASA) to prevent and mitigate the possible
environmental impacts that may result from the project.

94.      Legal Considerations. The assessment also includes a political and legal review
o f the existing national and municipal legislation and norms set to preserve and control
the environment. The Municipality w i l l follow all requirements set out by Bolivian L a w
1333 and Rule 24176, both o f which pertain to the environment. During the phase o f
project implementation, the Office o f Environmental Quality (Direccidn de Culidad
AmbientuL-DCA), within the Municipality, w i l l take the responsibility for ensuring that



                                               27
the project meets all o f i t s legal obligations, complying with all o f the recommendations
o f the P P M and PASA and current environmental legislation. The D C A w i l l coordinate
with the Office o f Works Supervision (Unidad de Supervisidn de Ubras--USO) on issues
o f prevention, mitigation, and labor safety.

95.     Possible Impacts and Suggested Mitigation Measures. In order to develop an
effective plan to mitigate potential environmental impacts, the assessment includes a l i s t
o f the activities that are potentially damaging to the local environment and possible
mitigation strategies. Table 14 in Annex 10 outlines the possible environmental impacts
and suggested mitigation measures.

96.    Previous Assessments. Finally, during the preparation o f a previous project, the
Environmental Manual o f the National Social and Productive Investment Fund (Manual
de Buenas Prdcticas Ambientales) which, in 2002, received a no objection from the
World Bank and has been used during the execution o f the ongoing projects financed b y
IDA, was revised to include number o f environmental concerns pertinent to c i v i l works in
urban and peri-urban areas. These are summarized in Annex 10 and w i l l be taken into
account during project implementation.

5. Indigenous

97.     I accordance with the Indigenous Peoples Policy and due to the high
        n
concentration of indigenous peoples living in the Municipality o f L a Paz (60 percent o f
the population), the entire project i s classified as an Indigenous Peoples Development
Plan. Annex 10 presents a summary o f the legal framework and key actions conducted in
order to guarantee that the indigenous communities benefit from the project.

98.     I t i s worth mentioning that the Education Reform L a w o f 1994 established the
provision o f an Intercultural Bilingual Education system in Bolivia. Consequently, due t o
the legal mandate, basic and secondary education programs designed and implemented by
the Ministry o f Education have included an B E conceptual framework. Although the
Ministry of Education i s currently refocusing i t s priorities in education, the Morales
administration's National Development Plan i s founded on a respect for multiculturalism.
This new governance model rejects a paradigm based on embedded colonial dynamics
and aims to accurately represent the interests o f the primarily indigenous population.
Furthermore, the Constituent Assembly (Asarnblea Constituyente) i s expected to address
fundamental issues on the structure of the Bolivia state and society, including increased
participation o f indigenous groups. As such, the Municipal response to education w i l l
also respond to these priorities.

6. Social

99.     A Municipal-level consultation process was conducted as part o f the preparation
o f the Municipal Development Plan (Plan de Desarrollo Municipal--JAYMA) for 2007-
201 1, and as a complement to the Municipality's Statistical Dossier. The survey aimed to




                                             28
 understand citizens' attitudes and demands regarding education and the services provided
 b y the Municipality.

 100. In addition, on M a y 4,2007, the O M D H held a workshop to present the project to
 stakeholders and to receive their feedback. The workshop was attended b y participants
 representing a number o f educational stakeholders, including parents, teachers,
 coordinators o f the educational networks (redes educativas), presidents of parent councils
 ('juntas escolares), and school directors from the macro-districts chosen for the project, as
 well as the head human development officer (Ofcial Mayor) and other personnel from
 the OMDH. Participants offered commentaries, suggestions, and questions regarding the

        Municipality of L a Paz: Secondary Education Transformation Project


Background

Between 2000 and 2005, Bolivia experienced a period o f political instability marked b y a
series o f failed governments and social unrest. In December 2005, the election o f a new
government headed by Evo Morales with an absolute majority o f 54 percent o f voters
established a strong mandate for a new approach to addressing the country's long-
standing social problems. In addition to i t s new president, the country has seen a dramatic
shift in the political arena, including a diminished influence o f traditional parties and
greater participation b y actors from social movements and intellectuals. The new
government has announced i t s intentions to prioritize constitutional reform and poverty
reduction based on a governance model that accurately represent the interests o f their
primarily indigenous population.

As a young, poor, rural, and sparsely populated country, Bolivia presents substantial
challenges to the development o f schooling. Nevertheless, i t has made great strides in
providing access to primary schooling. As o f 2005, the primary net enrollment rate in
Bolivia had reached 94 percent o f children aged 6-13. Primary completion rates increased
from 71.5 percent in 2001 to 77.8 percent in 2005, and are estimated to reach 85.8
percent b y 2010, placing Bolivia on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goal
(MDG) o f Universal Primary Completion.

The municipality o f L a Paz i s Bolivia's capital and third largest city. The current mayor
was elected to a second term in January 2005 and will serve for a period o f five more
years, with a strong political mandate and broad constituency. As i s the case with the
country as a whole, the education reform has also brought high enrollment rates to L a
Paz, and demand for secondary education has risen dramatically. In 2005, the primary net
enrollment rate in L a Paz had reached 89.2 percent o f children aged 6-13 (gross
enrollment rate for the same year was 97.8 percent). Currently, only 4.2 percent o f
children drop out o f primary school.

These successes aside, many students in L a Paz, especially the most vulnerable, do not
begin secondary school, and many more do not complete their secondary schooling. The
Municipality estimates i t s unmet demand at 40,465 students or about 45.7 percent o f the
population o f secondary school age.5 The gross enrollment rate in secondary education,
while slowly increasing, i s s t i l l a low 67.7 percent, as compared to 97.8 percent in
primary. In addition, 8.3 percent o f public secondary students drop out o f school.




 Unmet demand i s defined as marginality, or the population aged 15-17 that does not access public or
private secondary educational services.


                                                   30
L a Paz schools also suffer from serious deficiencies in efficiency and quality as indicated
by the net and gross enrollment rates as well as the percentage o f overage students.
According to 2005 data, in public secondary schools, the percentage o f female students
who are overage b y two or more years i s 21 percent; among males the number reaches 27
percent. Furthermore, 12.4 percent o f students repeat.

In summary, the main problems facing secondary education in L a Paz, are: i)
                                            il
overcrowding and lack o f infrastructure; i )o w enrollment and a large population o f out-
of-school youth; (iii)   high drop-out and repetition rates; (iv) l o w quality. In addition to
these problems facing the municipality's education system, the Municipal Office o f
Human Development (OMDH) i s facing the challenge o f meeting i t s education
obligations within a decentralized context. The O M D H does not have significant
experience designing, implementing or monitoring education policy that goes beyond
infrastructure. N o r do secondary schools have a history o f managing their own resources.

Social and economic background

(a) Overview at the national level

B o l i v i a i s the second poorest country in L a t i n America, w i t h a gross national income
per capita o f only US$1,010.6 Moreover, i t ranks as having one o f the most unequal
distributions o f income, Le. one o f the highest Gini Coefficients, in the L a t i n
American region. These inequities are most pronounced between the indigenous and
non-indigenous populations. The average indigenous person earns 27 percent less
than his or her non-indigenous counterpart w i t h the same level o f education, and 55
percent o f indigenous Bolivians successfully competing secondary education s t i l l l i v e
in poverty, compared to 40 percent o f non-indigenous Bolivians. Inequalities also
exist between men and women, w i t h illiteracy rates among women more than twice as
high as for m e n 7

B o l i v i a also has a population density that i s among the lowest in L a t i n America-7.5
people per square kilometer as opposed to the regional average o f 25. The
urbanization rate o f 62 percent i s also among the lowest in Latin America. B o t h l o w
population density and a l o w urbanization rate make providing universal access t o
social services challenging. This i s compounded by the fact that B o l i v i a i s a
relatively young country w i t h a growing population. While most other L a t i n
American nations are experiencing declining or constant birth cohorts, in Bolivia,
each subsequent cohort i s larger than the previous, placing constant pressure o n the
education system to expand. Indeed, 46 percent o f Bolivians today are 18 or younger.8

With 64 percent o f i t s population l i v i n g in cities, B o l i v i a i s not as urban as some o f i t s
South American neighbors (Argentina 89 percent; Chile 87 percent). However t w o

characteristics o f the urban population are noteworthy. The first i s that the levels o f
urban poverty in Bolivia are extremely high both in relative and absolute terms. In
terms o f absolute numbers, over half o f the poor (2.9 million) and 43 percent o f the
extreme poor (1.4 million) lived in urban areas in 2002, up f r o m one third (1.8
million) and one fourth (800 thousand) in 1997, respectively. The second i s that the
country's rate o f urbanization has been rising remarkably, f r o m 56 percent in 1990 to
64 percent in 2005. This i s due to the increased rural-to-urban search for opportunities
as well as migration f r o m small cities and mining areas to main urban centers since
the late 1990s. F r o m 1997 to 2002 urban migration doubled, as metro areas drew in
low-income migrants coming f r o m all regions at a current average annual growth rate
o f 3.2 percent.

(b) Overview at the municipal level

The Municipality o f L a Paz i s Bolivia's capital and third largest city. The Municipality o f
L a Paz occupies a total o f 2,012 km2 o f which 1,832 km2are classified as rural and 180
km2as urban. With a total population o f 793,2939 inhabitants, urban L a Paz makes up the
majority o f these, with around 790,000 inhabitants (compared with only about 3,700
inhabitants in rural areas). The municipality i s made up o f 23 districts, o f which 21 are
urban and 2 are rural. About 35 percent of L a Paz's population is classified as poor;
overall about one quarter o f L a Paz's urban population (almost 200,000 people) are
thought to live in areas at risk with very limited access to basic services. With a growth
rate o f about 0.1% percent per year, the Municipality o f L a Paz is growing more slowly
than Bolivia's other urban centers.

(e) Country-level development strategy

The new government announced i t s National Development Plan to the international aid
community in M a y o f 2006. The Plan titled "Dignified, Sovereign, Productive and
Democratic Bolivia, a plan for living well: 2006-201 0" prioritizes (i)              productive
development and j o b creation; (ii)     social justice and inclusion (fairness); and, ( i ) ii
macroeconomic stability. This i s a long-term plan that aims to set the development focus
for the next 50 years. I t s vision of well being or "living well" i s based o n a cosmocentric
view o f society that connects community values to every aspect o f government policy.
This vision w i l l be carried out through the three pillars o f the plan: Dignified Living,
Sovereign Living, and Productive Living. The pillar o f Dignified Living i s based on ideas
o f social protection including health, education, water and sanitation, housing and land,
as well as justice, national security and public safety, with a special focus on the
country's youth.

The proposed project w i l l take the lead in providing the Municipality o f L a Paz the
support i t needs to fulfill its role in carrying out this national mandate. Municipal
governments are some o f the natural agents to put this vision o f socially responsive
policies into practice. The Municipality o f L a Paz's interest in working with the Bank, its

capacity to borrow, and w i l l to tackle their education problems make them an optimal
partner for this project.

As one o f the nation's largest cities, L a Paz represents a unique opportunity to pioneer
new activities and set a standard o f innovation in the areas o f access and quality that can
be emulated b y other municipalities. Within this context o f decentralization, other
municipalities are likely to replicate the successes o f L a Paz as they continue to meet
their obligations in the education sector.

The national education system and its financing

During the last decade, Bolivia's public sector deficit was above 5 percent o f GDP, one
o f the worst in South America. Despite these fiscal challenges, the tables are slowly
turning. Educational expenditures have been steadily climbing since 1995 from 3.5
percent to more than 6 percent o f GDP in 2005, which i s just above the benchmark
suggested b y UNESCO (6 percent o f GDP). Furthermore, in the past year, Bolivia has
recorded a fiscal surplus o f approximately 4.87 percent, due mainly to the new
hydrocarbon policy, but also to an increase in tax collection efficiency. As a result o f this
improved situation, the education sector i s benefiting from a greater proportion o f the
national budget, and the country i s projected to invest just over 7 percent o f GDP in
education in the current calendar year.

Since the passing o f the Education Reform, Popular Participation, Administrative
Decentralization and Municipalities laws in the mid and late 1990s, these resources have
not all been concentrated at the central level. The laws introduced several policy and
institutional changes in the education sector. Under these frameworks, the central level
was placed in charge o f developing pedagogical approaches, defining the teacher and
administrative pay scale, and delineating promotion and staffing rules. The day-to-day
administration o f schools, the allocation o f teachers and the payment for administrative
and teachers' services are responsibility o f the regional level (Sewicios Departamentales
de Educacih-SEDUCAs).

The most important responsibility o f municipalities i s the construction and maintenance
o f infrastructure, the provision o f equipment, furniture and supplies t o schools, the
payment o f services such as electricity and water-at the initial, primary and secondary
levels-and the provision o f the school breakfast to all students attending primary school.
In recent years, some municipalities have extended the scope o f their responsibilities to
include interventions aimed at improving the quality o f education and strengthening the
participation o f communities in school activities. In 2001, the National Dialogue L a w
deepened the decentralization program b y handing over HIPC debt relief resources to
municipalities, o f which municipalities have to allocate 20 percent toward education.

The decentralization process has been successful in increasing the amount o f resources
invested in education and promoting greater involvement o f local authorities in the
sector. Financing o f education at the municipal level comes from: (i)
                                                                     municipalities own
                                                                                       i)
resources, which are collected from municipal patents, real state and vehicles taxes; ( i



                                             33
treasury transfers, which are revenue-sharing transfers, or "co-participations" from the
central government (20 percent o f the central government's tax collection is handed over
to municipalities according to population and poverty levels, called co-participacidn
                                                            i idebt
tributaria) and Hydrocarbon Direct Tax (IDH) transfers; ( i ) relief resources (funds
coming from the HIPC initiative which are delivered to municipalities, and from which
20 percent has to be directed to education); and (iv) grants and loans provided b y donor-
aid multilateral and bilateral agencies.

Even with this variety o f sources o f income available to municipalities, decisions related
to basic education are s t i l l reasonably centralized, with 89 percent o f the education
budget s t i l l allocated at the central level. This means that the vast majority o f the inputs
that schools are provided with are decided centrally or by deconcentrated units o f the
Ministry o f Education.

The municipal system and its funding

Over the last few years, the Municipality o f L a Paz has steadily increased the funding
allocated to the education sector, from Bs. 43.9 million in 2003 to Bs. 73.8 million in
2006. The largest sources are the Central Government transfers (revenue-sharing taxes
and IDH transfers), the municipality's own funds and debt relief resources. As a result of
increased tax collections from the Hydrocarbon sector, the Government i s seeing a
significant rise in i t s revenues, which are being transferred to regional and local
governments, increasing the amount devoted to the social sectors. UNICEF and the
Japanese have also granted financial assistance to the Municipality.

The Municipality's main activities in education are related to i t s mandate. Approximately
90 percent o f i t s spending in education i s devoted to the provision o f the school breakfast,
infrastructure and equipment. Some actions have been taken to address quality, such as
the training o f teachers and directors. Last year these activities were extended to
curricular transformation, productive-vocational education, and support to the national
literacy program. The Municipality's spending in the education sector i s presented in
Table 7 below.

The proposed project w i l l support the Municipality's current activities in education
within the municipal legal framework and w i l l pioneer quality related interventions that
complement activities carried out b y the Central Government. Project funds w i l l
supplement activities directed toward the provision and maintenance o f infrastructure,
significantly increasing i t s allocation. I t w i l l also leverage the assistance that other donors
(Japan and UNICEF) have been providing in this area.

The project w i l l considerably impact the budget assigned to education quality. The
quality component-which         includes the improvement o f educational learning
environments, the development o f school improvement plans, the awareness program for
teachers and directors on transversal topics and the pedagogical resource center
collaboration-will contribute approximately Bs. 7.8 million in 2007, Bs. 16.1 million in
2008 and Bs. 5.5 million in 2009. I t w i l l allow the continuity o f current activities such as
the strengthening of school networks, as well as the testing out o f new mechanisms that
proved to be effective in other countries, such as the transfer o f resources directly to
Education Management Committees to implement school improvement plans, an
intervention that has been successful in Brazil and Central America.

Educational Results-Access          and Efficiency

(a) National

Bolivia has attained almost universal primary enrollment since the late 1990s and the net
primary enrollment rate has reached 94 percent. This figure places Bolivia in line with
countries with higher GDP per capita such as Brazil and Peru and well above others such
as Ecuador or Colombia, which hover close to 90 percent. Other countries with s i m i l a r
GDP per capita, such as Guatemala or Honduras, have considerably lower net enrollment
rates o f 85 percent or lower. Educational efficiency in primary school has also shown
considerable improvement. Completion rates have increased from 71.5 percent in 2001
to 77.8 percent in 2005, and are estimated to reach 85 percent by 2010.



                                                   36
Greater access and increased completion, combined with the population pressure from
ever greater cohort size, w i l l inevitably result in an explosion o f demand for secondary
schooling which has already started. The two effects combined have placed Bolivia in a
situation in which secondary enrollment doubles every ten years. In the last ten years,
most o f this increase in enrollment was picked up b y the urban secondary schools. This
has led to overcrowded classrooms due to outdated infrastructure being used for far more
students than was initially intended.

In addition, the quality o f secondary education cannot be overlooked as access to this
level expands. In fact, quality in secondary schools presents an even greater challenge
than quality in primary schools. While primary schools were the recipients o f major
attention and reform in the last decade due to the Education Reform o f the 1990s,
secondary schools continue to offer outdated curricula and employ conventional teaching
techniques. Moreover, 45 percent o f secondary school teachers are not trained to teach at
            n
this level. I rural areas, the figure increases to 70 percent.

(b) Municipal

Since the adoption o f the Popular Participation L a w in 1994, Bolivia's education system
has undergone a process o f decentralization, leaving the bulk o f responsibility for
infrastructure and supplies in the hands o f the municipalities. Within t h i s mandate o f
decentralized educational services, L a Paz i s facing i t s own distinct challenges. On the
one hand, the Education Reform Program o f the 1990s has contributed to the
achievement o f important goals in primary enrollment and completion. In 2005, the
primary net enrollment rate in L a Paz had reached 89.2 percent o f children aged 6-13
(gross enrollment rate for the same year was 97.8 percent). Currently, only 4.2 percent o f
children drop out o f primary school.

O n the other hand, despite the fact that L a Paz's population growth rate hovers around a
slow 0.1 percent per year, the demand for Secondary education has risen dramatically
over the last decade, as have enrollments, which increased a total o f 18 percent between
1997 and 2005 in the public system (see
Table 8 below). Serving more than 7,000 more students than in the late 1990s, the
Municipality has been able to meet this demand only within the context o f overcrowding
in some schools and a significant increase in the student-teacher ratio f r o m 21:l in 1997
to 27: 1 in 2005; meanwhile the primary teacher-student ratio has been diminishing.

What's more, these figures mask an uneven assignment o f teachers between schools in
the periphery and those in the center, which are marked b y their high concentration o f
students-as many as 60 students per teacher. As a whole, the Municipality has a total o f
196 buildings housing 412 schools, or "educational units." O f these 196 buildings, only
three structures are dedicated solely to secondary schooling, while the majority o f
secondary schools share buildings with primary and pre-primary schools, resulting in an
average o f 1.3 secondary schools operating per educational structure, either
simultaneously or in shifts. In terms o f the teaching force, in 2005, there were 8,230 total



                                            37
teachers on the public record in the Municipality o f L a Paz, o f which 2,328, or 28
percent, served in secondary schools.

                         2002           22,800          22,821           45,621
                         2003           23,463          23,112           46,575
                         2004           24,446          23,897           48,343
                         2005           24,066          23,677           47,743

Despite growing enrollments in secondary education, a large number o f students o f
secondary age remain outside o f the system. The gross enrollment rate in secondary
education, while slowly increasing, i s s t i l l a l o w 67.7 percent, as compared to 97.8
percent in primary. In addition, 8.3 percent o f public secondary students drop out o f
school. The Municipality estimates i t s unmet demand at 40,465 students or about 45.7
percent o f the population o f secondary school age."

L a Paz schools also suffer from serious deficiencies in efficiency and quality as indicated
b y the net and gross enrollment rates as well as the percentage o f overage students.
According to 2005 data, in public secondary schools, the percentage o f female students
who are overage b y two or more years i s 21 percent; among males the number reaches 27
percent. Furthermore, 12.4 percent o f students repeat.

In summary, the main problems facing secondary education in L a Paz, are: i)
                                           il
overcrowding and lack o f infrastructure; i )o w enrollment and a large population o f out-
                   i ihigh
of-school youth; ( i ) drop-out and repetition rates; and (iv) l o w quality. In addition
to these challenges facing the municipality's education system, the OMDH does not have
significant experience designing, implementing or monitoring education policy that goes
beyond infrastructure. N o r do secondary schools have a history o f managing their own
resources.

Government Strategy

(a) National

During the second half o f the 1990s, Bolivia embarked upon an ambitious Education
Reform Program (ERP) that profoundly changed the educational landscape o f the
country. The Reform focused on primary education and changed the organization o f the
system, the curriculum, the pedagogical approaches with the adoption o f constructivism

IO
  Unmet demand i s defined as marginality, or the population aged 14-17 that does not access public or
private secondary educational services.


                                                   38
and intercultural bilingual education, pedagogical materials, initial teacher training
through the reform o f the Normal Institutes, teacher compensation through the adoption
o f various bonuses and incentives, popular participation through the creation o f a
participation structure o f councils parallel to the structure o f the Educational System and
system management through the transformation o f the ME. Secondary education, which
was largely neglected in the Reform process, s t i l l suffers from an 18-subject curriculum,
imbalanced classroom sizes (overcrowded classrooms in some schools and l o w pupil
teacher ratios in others), outdated pedagogical materials, and inadequate infrastructure.

One o f the failings o f the Educational Reform o f the 1990s was that i t was carried out in a
top down fashion with relatively little input from key stakeholders such as teachers and
their unions. This i s no longer an option in Bolivia today where all stakeholders have
strong voices. The Morales Administration, which took office in early 2006, has decided
not to continue with the reform process as i t currently stands, but to develop a new
proposal under the future Ley Elizardo Pe'rez y Avelino SiAani, which i s currently being
formulated. In the meantime, some policies that were introduced with the Education
Reform Program (ERP) continue under the new administration, while new government
priorities have begun implementation, such as the literacy program Yo S i Puedo and the
Juancito Pinto conditional cash transfer program.

In order to improve enrollment and reduce dropout rates, the Government launched the
Juancito Pinto bonus in late 2006. Juancito Pinto i s a conditional cash transfer that
consists o f the payment o f Bs. 200 (equivalent to U S $ 25) per year to students from first
to fifth grade o f primary that have attended class at least 80 percent o f the school calendar
year. This CCT i s financed with resources from the recently increased hydrocarbons tax.
Implementation arrangements, control and accountability are still being defined (last year
the bonus was delivered b y the Armed Forces).

The national education system i s currently in a state o f transition, between the priorities
o f the ERP and the new priorities o f the Morales administration. The new government's
proposed changes have been outlined in the National Development Plan (NDP), which


        .
include the following policies:

            Transforming the education system. The objective i s to better integrate the
            education sector at all levels-initial,    primary, secondary and tertiary-
            w i t h the productive sector, and to promote the participation o f territorial
            and social organizations in designing, following-up and evaluating
            education policies. The proposal places greater emphasis o n the tertiary
            level so that adequate pedagogical approaches are developed, financing
            sources are diversified, and universities respond to the needs o f the
            productive sector and the supply o f tertiary education i s extended to reach


        .
            rural areas (through the creation o f indigenous universities).

            Education of quality that prioritizes equal opportunities. The purpose i s
            to extend the coverage and quality o f education services t o rural and peri-
            urban areas, and to support the access and permanence o f indigenous
            groups, out-of-school adults, women, and people w i t h disabilities. The


                                              39
           main programs included in this strategy are: (i)       the Sustained Literacy
           Program that w i l l benefit youth and adults in rural and marginalized urban
           areas; and (ii)  the Quality Education w i t h Social, Ethnic, Gender and
           Generational Equity, which aims at supporting children and adolescents
           who work, the education o f children in rural areas, and the physically
           handicapped. I t also includes professionalizing teachers who have not been
           trained as such, and certifying the competencies and abilities o f
           craftspeople.

           Education policy that generates, adapts, and applies science and
           technology. The aim i s to promote research activities at all levels o f
           education that respond to local productive needs and vocations. Several
           strategies are being considered, such as: (i)the development o f
           intersectoral processes that integrate the actions implemented b y the
           central, regional, and municipal levels to link education management with
           the region's productive and cultural needs; this includes the Education for
           Production with Cultural Identity Program and the strengthening o f
           technical institutes and centers; (ii) Productive and Healthy Schools
                                                    the
           Program, aimed at providing infrastructure and equipment to universities
                                                ii
           and technological centers; ( i )the promotion o f knowledge and
           technologies o f indigenous ancestral cultures through a transformed
           curriculum; and, (iv) the Information and Communication Technologies
           (ICTs) Program that w i l l encourage the use o f I C T s in education processes
           at all levels, but w i t h special emphasis on tertiary. Under this program all
           public secondary schools would receive a package o f computers w i t h
           Internet connection.

(b) Municipal

The Strategy o f the Municipality for 2006-2011 i s outlined in the Municipal
Development Plan (MDP). I terms o f Human Development, the main objective i s to
                             n
achieve universal access to basic services, including education.

The Municipality's main objectives in the area o f education are: (1) t o improve the
delivery o f the educational service in order to reduce repetition and dropout rates; (2) to
improve the quality o f education b y deepening the Education Reform process in the
region, providing in-service training to teachers in formal and alternative education, and
developing an education information system; and (3) to provide equipment (laboratories
and libraries) to schools and education centers in urban and rural areas.

The vision guiding this strategy in education is to have an efficient and effective
education system. I t prioritizes the specialization o f education infrastructure (school
buildings that cover only one level o f education instead o f multiple levels
simultaneously), and education linked to the productive sector.

The Annual Operational Plan (POA) o f the Municipality o f L a Paz summarizes the main
activities that are being implemented to reach the objectives o f the MDP. In terms o f


                                            40
education, current activities include: (i)significant investments in education
                   provision o f school breakfast to reduce dropout rates in primary; ( i )
infrastructure; (ii)                                                                         ii
provision o f supplemental food to children under five years old; (iv) development of
students' computer s k i l l s (computer literacy), including the provision o f computers to 57
secondary schools; (v) support to the implementation o f the national literacy program Yo
Si Puedo; (vi) review o f school infrastructure in order to comply with municipal
legislation; and (vii) provision o f equipment and furniture to initial, primary, and
secondary schools.

Government strategies and the proposed project

The proposed project contributes to the goals o f both the national and municipal
education strategies. The Municipality o f L a Paz has been developing increased
management capacity and has assumed the responsibility for improving the delivery o f
education services. I t has proven i t s commitment not only to the expansion o f service to
underserved areas, but also to the improvement o f educational quality. The proposed
project objectives w i l l enhance the activities that the Municipality has outlined in i t s
Municipal Development and Annual Operational Plans. I t also responds to the current
national vision in the area o f education, namely by focusing on education quality and
equal educational opportunities for all, and b y seeking out ways o f collaborating with the
productive and social sectors o f the country.

(a) Component 1: Access and Permanence. The expansion o f secondary education
access and permanence w i l l support the Municipality's commitment to expand coverage
o f secondary education to unattended areas and overcrowded urban center districts and to
reduce dropout and repetition rates. In attending to students previously outside the
system, this component also supports the national level strategy o f prioritizing equal
opportunities to all, including marginalized peri-urban groups, b y building two schools in
peri-urban areas and promoting access to secondary education for all citizens o f L a Paz.

(b) Component 2: Quality of Secondary Education. This component w i l l strongly
support the Municipality's activities aimed at improving the quality service delivery. The
subcomponent focusing on Improving Learning Environments w i l l help reduce
overcrowding in districts in the urban center, where the greatest concentration o f students
attends secondary school. The program for Awareness-Raising in Transversal Themes
w i l l supplement the Municipality's goals to provide in-service training for teachers and
principals. Strengthening o f Educational Communities and the implementation o f School
Improvement Plans w i l l support the Municipality's commitment to improving education
quality b y bringing decentralization down to the lowest level, by strengthening
educational communities and promoting the participation o f schools in the design and
following-up of educational policies. Finally, the Pedagogical Resource Platform
collaboration w i l l support both municipal and national goals, by reinforcing school
resources and, and b y providing linkages with the productive sector and promoting the

increasing secondary completion rates o f approximately 5,130 students at risk o f
educational failure, defined as having two or more years o f age/grade distortion.

Subcomponent 1.1: Educational Infrastructure and Equipment (US$ 4.52 million,
excluding contingencies). This subcomponent aims to increase the availability o f student
places and improve the physical conditions o f secondary schools b y constructing four
schools and 150 classrooms in new and existing schools. Three schools w i l l be built on
new sites, and one w i l l be built on an existing site. The Municipality has established that
all land designated for construction pertain to the Municipality, and as such no
resettlement w i l l be necessary. Furthermore, all land titles are in place and all
architectural plans have been drawn up.

The project w i l l finance: (i) new construction and equipping o f four educational
                               the
infrastructures (95 classrooms) creating 7,600 new school places (40 student spaces per
classroom in two turns); and (ii) new construction and equipping o f approximately
                                   the
150 classrooms expanding new and existing infrastructures and creating 12,000 new
school places (40 student places per classroom in two turns).

This subcomponent w i l l create a total o f 19,600 new secondary places, which b y 2010 are
expected to be filled b y 4,560 new students, increasing enrollment b y 9.4%, as well as by
students transferring from overcrowded schools and classrooms. The targeted schools lie
in districts that have demonstrated demand according to two criteria: (i) index o f
                                                                                an
unsatisfied demand as determined by the number o f marginalized (out o f school) youth in
each educational district; and (ii) prevalence of overcrowding.

Subcomponent 1.2: Incentive Program for Students at Risk o Education Failure (US$
                                                               f
0.38 million, excluding contingencies). This subcomponent aims to create an incentive
program serving 5,130 students at risk of dropping out in the targeted districts. At-risk
students are identified as those exhibiting two or more years o f age/grade distortion in
grades seven and eight o f primary, and one and two o f secondary.

Under this subcomponent, the project w i l l finance the development o f an intervention
providing direct pedagogical support to these at-risk students to ensure that they remain
in the education system to complete their primary and secondary studies and improve
their critical thinking and communication skills. The pedagogical support will consist o f a
targeted supplementary academic and skills-building course provided b y pedagogical
experts and offered after school or as a complement to the school day. These experts w i l l
in some cases be contracted by the Municipality, and in other cases w i l l function out o f



                                             58
institutions already providing such services in L a P a . This subcomponent w i l l draw on
existing materials and programs wherever possible, and has been designed to leverage
additional donor funding should it become available.

Included in the financing on this subcomponent i s the design o f the course modules, the
exit exam, and printing o f all materials. The design o f a diagnostic questionnaire and
entrance exam w i l l be financed b y the Japanese donation to facilitate i t s earliest possible
implementation.

Component 2: Quality of Education. (US$ 3.73 million, excluding contingencies).
This component supports efforts b y the Municipality to improve the quality o f basic
education with a focus on secondary education. The quality component concentrates
primarily on two activities: the rehabilitation o f dilapidated educational infrastructure and
the development o f a program that strengthens educational communities through School
Improvement Plans (SIPS) and direct financial transfers to Education Management
Committees to fund these plans. This component also includes interventions to promote
awareness o f transversal themes and centralized provision o f academic resources by
establishing partnerships to create Pedagogic Resource Platforms (PRPs). The four
subcomponents are described below in more detail.

Subcomponent 2.1: Improvement o Educational Learning Environments. (US$ 1.77
                                     f
million, excluding contingencies). This subcomponent aims to improve learning
environments through the renovation and reconstruction o f educational infrastructure and
the implementation o f an experimental maintenance program. In specific, this
subcomponent w i l l finance: (i) reconstruction and equipping o f three dilapidated
                                 the
school buildings (totaling 63 classrooms); and (ii)   implementation o f an experimental
maintenance program that manages the maintenance o f 135 school buildings through
three alternative mechanisms that vary according to the size and complexity o f the c i v i l
works: (a) strengthening the current centralized approach for smaller works; (b)
subcontracting with the private sector for larger works; and, (c) carrying out awareness-
raising campaigns in schools focusing on daily maintenance and care coupled with a total
of four semi-annual School Improvement Days in which educational communities
participate in improving and beautifying their schools.

The specific need for renovation and reconstruction i s defined based on secondary
education demand at the district level and b y the state o f the physical infrastructure o f
secondary schools. C i v i l works w i l l be financed b y the proposed project, complementing
other rehabilitation initiatives currently underway. C i v i l works w i l l benefit from external
supervision, which w i l l be financed b y the project, as w i l l the evaluation o f the three
experimental mechanisms for building maintenance.

Subcomponent 2.2: Awareness-Raising Programs on Transversal Themes. (US$ 0.36
million, excluding contingencies). The objective o f this subcomponent i s to contribute
to the development o f civic values and attitudes within the educational community. This
component consists of the design and delivery o f simple awareness programs for 1,084
teachers, 8 1 school directors, and 792 representatives from the Juntas Escolares (parent



                                               59
councils) on transversal topics defined b y the Municipality, including: democracy, gender
equity, health and sexuality, environment, multiculturalism, and life skills. The project
w i l l finance: (i) publication o f a series o f booklets covering the transversal themes
                   the
and their use in the classroom; (ii)   short workshops for teachers, school directors, and
parents addressing the above issues; and (iii)   development o f an interactive website for
use b y teachers, directors, parents and students.

After collecting and revising the previously existing material already produced on the
transversal themes, the Municipality w i l l contract a consultant to design the booklets and
program, and to facilitate the workshops. A separate consultant w i l l be hired to develop
and maintain the website.

Subcomponent 2.3: Pedagogical Resource Platforms (PRPs). (US$ 0.39 million,
excluding contingencies). Through this innovative subcomponent, the Municipality w i l l
enter into partnerships with educational institutions (NGOs, research institutes, training
organizations, etc.) with the space, capacity and experience to house and run a total o f up
to seven Pedagogic Resource Platforms (PRPs) in service o f neighboring schools and the
community. These partnerships w i l l be entered into with institutions that can also benefit
from additional equipment to make such centers operational. Partnership between the
private sector and the public sector is critical for the success o f this intervention. The
PRPs w i l l act as multi-service educational centers providing access to science and
computer labs, learning materials, and as a central hub that could potentially integrate
various activities within the proposed project, such as awareness-raising workshops and
pedagogical reinforcement to at-risk students. This subcomponent has been designed to
leverage additional donor funding should i t become available.

The subcomponent w i l l finance two types o f PRP models, depending on the institutional
arrangements with the potential partner: (i)provision o f a subgrant directly to the partner
                                                                                 i)
institution to purchase equipment and to finance operation o f the PRPs; and ( ipurchase
o f equipment and materials b y the Municipality which are then transferred to the partner
institution for their use in the PRPs.

Subcomponent 2.4: Strengthening o Educational Communities. (US$ 1.21 million,
                                        f
excluding contingencies). This subcomponent, which i s meant to make a significant
contribution toward improving the quality o f primary and secondary education, provides
direct financing to school buildings to create and implement annual school-level strategic
plans called School Improvement Plans (SIPS). It i s based on the idea that school-based
management brings decision-making closer to stakeholders and permits stronger social
accountability, thus allowing for a greater chance o f improving the quality and relevance
o f investments. I t also contributes to the strengthening o f the capacity of school-level
actors such as school directors and Juntas Escolares, school councils established under
the previous educational reform-thereby         breaking the cycle o f centralized school
management and administration.

The subcomponent w i l l finance: (i)training and support to school management
committees (Equipos de Gestidn Educativa) in the development o f School Improvement



                                             60
Plans (SIPs), including development o f a manual outlining the basic steps for developing
                               i)
and implementing SIPs; and ( ifinancing o f SIPs b y a direct per-capita yearly transfer b y
the Municipality to at least 137 o f a total o f 196 primary and secondary school buildings.

Guidelines for financing categories have been set out in the operational manual and w i l l
be included in the S I P manual. They are focused primarily on interventions for improving
educational quality, including: a) preservation andor improvement o f educational
infrastructure; b) equipment; c) interventions to improve teachingAearning processes;
and, d) fulfillment o f the goals o f the Municipality's on-going school maintenance
program, Operucidn Cole, b y keeping schools clean and well-maintained. Guidelines for
the Operucidn Cole program are already established and include: keeping the faGade
clean and well cared for, preserving the windows and furniture, cleaning the classrooms
and patios, cleaning and maintaining the bathrooms, and appropriate disposal o f litter.

Responsibility for budgeting the allotted funds w i l l lie with educational management
committees (Equipos de Gestidn Educutivu) made up o f school directors, teachers,
parents, and students, and w i l l be carried out through the development of school
improvement plans (SIPs). All members o f the Education Management Committees w i l l
be expected to take part in an orientation session, which w i l l train them in the
development o f SIPs, financial management, and the use o f the Manual for the Design
and Implementation o f School Improvement Projects-the            primary tool for this
subcomponent. SIPs w i l l be developed prior to the transfer o f financial resources and
approved b y a classifying committee at the O M D H . Schools can choose to allocate the
funds according to their individual needs; however, the SIP allocations w i l l follow certain
spending categories outlined by the Municipality, such as maintenance, supplies,
materials, professional development, operational costs, etc.

Throughout the life o f the project, at least 960 SIPS w i l l be developed and at least 411
w i l l be financed and implemented. The amount o f the financial transfers w i l l vary
between $1.47 and $2.68 per student depending on whether the school has fulfilled the
requirements o f the Operucidn Cole program. This amount was established according to
available funds in the project, and according to the Municipality's ability to sustain the
SIP program after the end o f the project cycle. Transfers will take place once a year for
three years to schools who have developed SIPs according to the established criteria and
approved b y the OMDH's Unit o f Educational and Pedagogical Services (UGESP).

Component 3: Education Management and Institutional Strengthening. (US$ 0.86
million, excluding contingencies). This component aims to strengthen management
capacity at the municipal and school levels to facilitate actions to improve access to and
completion and quality o f secondary education. In line with the country's decentralized
education system, the project will involve the Municipality as a key actor in education
management in a manner that enhances, but does not overlap with the responsibilities o f
the Ministry o f Education. The objective o f this component will be achieved through the
four subcomponents described below:




                                             61
Subcomponent 3.1: Management and Monitoring Information System. (US$ 0.39
million, excluding contingencies). This subcomponent aims to strengthen the education
information system o f the Municipality, particularly o f the OMDH. The project w i l l
finance: (i)   the adaptation of SIMAF, an existing management and monitoring
information system used in the Urban Infrastructure Project that w i l l track relevant
indicators and outputs; (ii)  provision o f equipment, materials, and consultants necessary
for carrying out project management and implementation; and (iii)       contracting o f auditing
services to carry out annual project audits. This subcomponent would also support in situ
training in the use o f the S I M A F for the person(s) in charge o f tracking and monitoring
indicators and project progress.

Subcomponent 3.2: Impact Evaluation. (US$ 0.20 million, excluding contingencies).
The project w i l l finance the design and implementation o f an evaluation of the Secondary
Education Transformation Project to measure the program effects and impacts. The
impact evaluation w i l l be carried out b y an external consulting firm with expertise in
evaluation, and w i l l be co-financed b y a Japan PHRD grant, which w i l l be used for the
gathering o f baseline data. The methodology o f the impact evaluation w i l l consist o f
comparing the project impact indicators in the Municipality o f L a Paz with the same
indicators in three other comparable municipalities that do not have the intervention. The
goal o f the evaluation i s to determine whether the project interventions affect the impact
indicators enough to differentiate L a Paz from municipalities that did not have such
interventions. Detailed terms o f reference have already been developed for both the
baseline and the impact evaluation.

Subcomponent 3.3: Institutional Strengthening of OMDH. (US$ 0.I 3 million,
excluding contingencies). As the Municipality moves towards the full implementation o f
the SIL, this component w i l l focus on improving i t s capacity to enhance i t s financial and
accounting practices and revise i t s procurement and financial management norms in
accordance with international standards, and other activities related to improving
OMDH's performance on education sector. In particular, the project w i l l support: (i)      the
purchasing o f equipment and furniture for the OMDH; (ii)       professional development for
                     i i the
the OMDH; and ( i ) design and implementation o f an informational campaign
publicizing the Project and i t s activities.

Subcomponent 3.4: Assessment o Student Learning Progress. (US$ 0.14 million,
                                    f
excluding contingencies). This subcomponent aims to develop a school-level student
progress assessment to be administered twice a year to all students in their second year o f
secondary schooling in the areas o f math and language. This innovative assessment
system w i l l be designed and systematized centrally (at the municipal level), but
administered and corrected by the teachers themselves, thus acting as both a student
assessment and teacher training exercise. This low-stakes testing serves the purpose o f
providing a learning barometer for the Municipality, school directors, and teachers
without duplicating the higher-stakes accountability and assessment function held by the
Ministry o f Education. The project w i l l finance an external consultancy that will: (i)
                          i)
design the assessments; ( itrain teachers and school directors on test administration and
evaluation; (iii)organize the logistics o f test preparation and administration; and, (iv)



                                              62
interpret and systematize test results. I t also contributes to developing a culture of
evaluation among teachers and in the educational community. Teachers w i l l be
interviewed about their experiences with the assessment process, and results w i l l be
publicized in order to socialize lessons learned and support efforts to evaluate teaching
and learning in general.

Project implementation

The Mayor's office o f L a Paz i s the highest decision making body within the municipal
government. I t i s responsible for promoting and advancing sustainable, equitable and
participatory human development within the municipality through the formulation and
implementation o f policies, plans, programs and projects in accordance with departmental
and national development plans.

The Municipal Office o f Human Development (Ofcialia Mayor de Desarrollo Humano-
OMDH) i s the technical body responsible for carrying out the municipality's obligations
in human development. I t i s made o f four offices: Education, Health, Citizen's Rights and
Sports, and two special units: Citizen Security and Infrastructure, which together carry
out local policies.

With the policy o f decentralization, which began in 1994, the Municipality o f L a Paz
prioritized i t s interventions in the area o f education, especially in the provision of
physical infrastructure, i t s construction, renovation, maintenance, equipping, and
furnishing, as well as provision o f learning materials, and supervision and administration
o f their use.

Within the scope o f the responsibilities accorded the municipality, the O M D H w i l l be
directly responsible for the execution o f the Secondary Education Transformation Project
in the Municipality o f L a Paz, through the Office o f Education and the Infrastructure
Unit, coordinating with the other technical bodies within the Municipality. Moreover, the
Municipality w i l l inform the Ministry o f Education regarding the activities and goals o f
the Project.

Implementationarrangements

All project activities w i l l be implemented by the Municipality o f L a Paz (GMLP) through
the Municipal Office o f Human Development (OMDH), which w i l l have responsibility
for overall design, management, supervision, coordination, technical and fiduciary
control, and monitoring and evaluation.

The organization structure defined for project implementation i s being designed based on
the structure o f the GMLP passed through the Municipal Ordinance No867/06 issued by
the OMDH, which defines the relation and coordination with other units o f the GMLP as
presented in Figure 1 below:

The G M L P units that w i l l be operationally supporting the implementation o f the Project
are placed at the directional level o f the Municipality (Mayor) and in specialized
technical units that w i l l give support to the overall project management-the Executive
Secretariat and the units that work under this branch office:

e) The Special Office o f Finances will support the financial management activities and
   payment processes;


                                                                          66
f) The Office of Planning and Control w i l l contribute to the monitoring of technical and
   administrative project activities through i t s specific M&E system;
g) The Office of Bidding and Contracts will provide support for procurement processes;
h) The Office for the Oversight of Works and Services w i l l support the civil works
   inspection processes.

Also, the Environmental Quality Office, which works under the Municipal Technical
Office, will contribute to implementation through supervision of civil works and
mitigation of any negative externalities generated through project implementation.

This project w i l l not have an independent Project Coordinating Unit, as an underlying
objective of this effort i s to build the Municipality's capacity to administer efficiently i t s
education services network. As a result, the Municipal Office of Human Development
(OMDH) w i l l have the overall responsibility for the coordination of project
implementation. Day-to-day implementation w i l l be the responsibility of the relevant
staff of the OMDH at all levels, under the direction of the Head Human Development
Officer (Ofcial Mayor de Desarrollo Hurnano).

The OMDH i s responsible for the political and strategic definition in education, health,
civil rights, sports and civil security. The O M D H also has a Unit o f Equipment and
Infrastructure (UIE), for Human Development, which w i l l be responsible of the execution
of the Access and Permanence component. I t also has an Administrative and Financial
Center which w i l l be responsible for managing the resources, together with the Special

          Municipality of L a Paz: Secondary Education Transformation Project


Executive Summary

As part of the preparation process for the L a Paz Secondary Education Transformation
Project, a financial management assessment was performed to determine the adequacy o f
the GMLP's and specifically the OMDH's financial management arrangements to
support project implementation. The assessment was performed in accordance with
O P B P 10.02 and the Manual "Financial Management Practices in World Bank Financed
Investment Operations." The evaluation was carried out on site between February and
March, 2007 and i t included visits and interviews with the O M D H and GMLP fiduciary
staff. The objective o f the assessment was to determine the capacity o f the O M D H to
properly manage and account for all project proceeds and to produce timely, accurate and
reliable financial statements for general and Bank special purposes. The assessment was
updated during the appraisal mission held in July, 2007.

Overall Conclusion

Bolivia's public financial management risk rating is substantial." The main weaknesses
identified at the sub-national level are related to the uneven application o f the legal
framework, particularly with regard to financial reporting and the internal control
environment. However, i t i s important to mention that the Municipality o f L a Paz has
demonstrated significant progress in strengthening i t s financial management systems in
the past years. T o the extent possible, the structure, systems and other existing
arrangements within the GMLP, w i l l be used for the project.

Nevertheless, the nature o f the project design and implementation arrangements requires
that the existing arrangements be strengthened due to the associated risks and some
identified weaknesses that may prevent the implementing entities from providing the
Bank, the Borrower, and other interested parties with accurate and timely information
regarding project resources, expenditures, and activities.

As o f the date o f the appraisal, several actions have been taken towards strengthening the
financial management system. In relation to the FM arrangements for School
Improvement Plans Sub-component, general processes and procedures have been agreed.
However, further refining i s s t i l l required, in addition to the definition o f the financial
agreements and financial reports at the school level.                          Regarding the
installment/adaptation o f the financial management system (SIMAF), there are s t i l l some
pending actions related to the issuance o f the interim financial reports and recording o f
the School Improvement Plans Sub-component.

In view o f the significant progress reached so far and subject to the successful completion
o f the actions mentioned above, the Financial Management Team concludes that the
arrangement proposed for the implementation o f the project b y the O M D H can be
considered acceptable.

Weaknesses and action plan

The GMLP through the O M D H i s working on the completion o f the actions agreed to as
a result o f the financial management capacity assessment.

Financial management implementation arrangements

As described in section C.2 o f this PAD, the project w i l l be implemented b y the
Municipality o f L a Paz (GMLP), through the Municipal Office o f Human Development
(Oficialiu Mayor de Desurrollo Humano--OMDH), which w i l l assume overall
responsibility. To the extent possible, the structure, systems, and other existing
arrangements within the GMLP w i l l be used and strengthened as needed. Therefore,
following the GMLP' s financial management and administrative arrangements, the
project's financial management tasks w i l l be undertaken by the OMDH's Administrative
Finance Unit (CAF), in close coordination with the Office o f Planning and Control
(Direccidn de Planificacidn y Control) and the Special Office o f Finances (Direccidn
Especial de Finanzas) for programming and treasury issues, respectively.

The OMDH's finance unit i s staffed with five professionals, mostly with administrative
backgrounds, and who mainly carry out budgeting and accounting functions. Although
they know the municipal administration very well, they have no experience in the
administration o f externally financed operations. Therefore, i t has been agreed that they
w i l l receive technical assistance in the preparation process. As o f the date o f the
appraisal, the team has been strengthened with the contracting o f a qualified financial


                                               73
management specialist, selected following Bank procedures and financed with credit
proceeds. This position w i l l be kept during project implementation. .

Additionally, i t w i l l be important that key staff be trained in WB processes, procedures
and related requirements, in order to be able to assume responsibility for all functions,
from planning to the preparation o f financial statements and auditing.

Programming and budget

The preparation o f the annual program and budget will follow local regulations
established b y the Ministry o f Finance,13 and specific regulations and instructions issued
by the GMLP. However, those general procedures are being complemented b y some
specific guidelines to be followed b y the O M D H in relation to the project, including clear
roles and responsibilities, both within the O M D H and other units such as the GMLP's
Planning and Control Unit, to ensure adequate reviewing and approval procedures.

The following issues w i l l need to be considered in order to allow for adequate budget
control: 1) timely preparation o f programming, budget and procurement plans,
establishing a clear relation among them; 2) proper recording o f the approved budget in
the financial management system, following not only Government required classification,
but also a classification b y project component and cost category (as needed); and 3)
timely recording o f commitments, payments, and accruals as needed, to allow for
adequate budget monitoring and also to provide accurate information on project
commitments for programming purposes.

Accounting information system

The G M L P has to comply with the Governmental Accounting Standards. Therefore, the
project i s in the process o f adapting the SIMAF system to match i t s account plan (project
component/subcomponents/actions/activities) with that o f the General Accounting Office.
Project transactions and preparation o f financial statements w i l l follow the cash basis o f
accounting.

The project w i l l benefit from the use o f S I G M A (the Government's integrated financial
management system), and the Single Municipal Account (CUM) to process payments.
However, in order to address i t s information needs to ensure an adequate monitoring o f
project activities, the use o f SIGMA w i l l be complemented by the use o f a ring-fenced
integrated system-SIMAF-that          is being used b y another externally financed project
within the GMLP. Such a system integrates the budgetary, accounting, and procurement
functions and allows for the use o f a more customized classification o f project
expenditures with the subsequent preparation o f the project's financial reports and
withdrawal applications. The basic arrangements in terms o f the functional chart o f
accounts, accounting manual and specific format and content o f the financial reports need
to be incorporated in the system as i t i s adapted to specific project needs.

Written procedures

In general, the GMLP has worked on the preparation o f specific processes and procedures
for i t s administrative and financial tasks, including the definition o f roles and
responsibilities, segregation o f duties, and relevant internal controls, especially for
payment purposes. Taking into account that project implementation would also require
the participation o f other units within the OMDH, procedures were streamlined to meet
project needs, and specific flow charts were prepared reflecting the processes and
procedures to be applied, providing for an adequate segregation o f duties, not only within
the OMDH, but also in i t s relation with the Municipal Treasury, procurement,
Infrastructure Unit and Oversight Unit. These procedures also reflect the internal control
mechanisms in terms o f authorization and approval, and the specific documentation
required in each step. These procedures are reflected in the project's operational manual.

A key issue that w i l l require further work from the project implementation team i s the
training o f the Education Management Committees ( E q u i p s de Gestidn Educativa)
composed o f school directors, teachers, and parents, for the implementation and
administration o f the funds to be transferred, following a matching-grant feature for the
implementation o f the specific activities, including purchase o f school materials,
consultant services, goods, etc. This w i l l require that these Committees are also trained in
the basic administrative and financial management requirements, and that at the same
time adequate supervision i s provided b y the O M D H team.

As opposed to other public sector entities, the internal audit function within the GMLP
has been widely developed and strengthened, not only in terms o f performing traditional
financial/operational audits, but also for performing physical evaluations o f infrastructure
works. Therefore, this function w i l l definitely help to strengthen the oversight function
and internal control over the project.

Financial reporting

Taking into account the considerations made in the accounting section, i t is expected that
the financial reports be directly prepared from the integrated system (SIMAF). The
interim financial reports w i l l specify sources and applications o f project resources and a
statement o f investment by project component, reporting the current quarter and the
accumulated operational spending against ongoing plans. The reports would include
credit proceeds, and local funds provided b y the GMLP, if applicable. Those reports
would be prepared and submitted to the Bank on a quarterly basis. The reports would be
prepared in local currency and U S dollars.

With the definition o f project components/subcomponents and main activities, the
O M D H through CAF, has worked on developing the specific content and format o f the
reports.




                                             75
For subcomponent 2.4, the format and content o f the accountability documents to be
prepared by schools are being defined in a Manual for the Design and Implementation of
School Improvement Plans. Education Management Committees w i l l not receive a
second transfer until verifying that the previous transfer has been properly accounted for.

Audit arrangements

Annual audit reports on project financial statements, including a management letter,
should be submitted to the Bank, within six months o f the end o f the Borrower's fiscal
year (December 31). The audit should be conducted b y an independent audit firm
acceptable to the Bank and under terms o f reference approved b y the Bank. The cost o f
the audit would be financed out o f credit proceeds and selection would follow standard
Bank procedures. The scope o f the audit would be defined b y the O M D H team in
agreement with the Bank, based on project-specific requirements and responding, as
appropriate for identified risks

Flow of Funds and Disbursement Arrangements

Considering the results of the assessment, the following disbursement methods may be
used to withdraw funds from the credit: (a) reimbursement, (b) advance, and (c) direct
payment.

Under the advance method, to facilitate project implementation, a segregated Designated
Account (DA-formerly       Special Account) in U S dollars would be opened and
maintained in the Central Bank o f Bolivia in the name o f the project. This account would
be managed b y the O M D H through the CAF, which would then have direct access to
funds advanced b y the Bank to this DA. Funds deposited into the DA as advances would
follow the Bank's disbursement policies and procedures, to be described in the legal
agreement and Disbursement Letter.

Taking into consideration that the municipality o f L a Paz is using SIGMA and the Single
Municipal Account (CUM), in compliance with local regulations, a specific Libretu
within the C U M would be opened exclusively for credit funds and would be used to
process payments in local currency through the Municipal Treasury, following the
established mechanism.

Disbursements to schools under subcomponent 2.4

Upon completing the legal and administrative requirements established for receiving the
funds, the OMDH would issue a payment check on the name o f the School Director, who
represents the Education Management Committee, and who would thereafter assume full
responsibility for the use o f the funds The funds received would then be deposited into a
local currency private bank account, open in a commercial Bank to be managed by the
Director and Treasurer on behalf o f the Committee, but under i t s direct control and
supervision. As activities are completed (goods delivered, services rendered or works




                                            76
completed), corresponding payments would be made from the bank account, making sure
adequate records are kept for further reporting.

Although checks delivered to the Director and deposited in the corresponding bank
accounts would be recorded in project's accounting as investments, the project team has
established adequate procedures for following-up on the use o f those resources. Approval
o f the financial reports submitted b y the Committees provide for an on-site verification
by OMDH's staff. Education Management Committees w i l l not receive a second transfer
until verifying that the previous transfer has been properly accounted for.

The specific procedures for the management o f funds disbursed for implementation o f the
SIPS, are established in the Manual for the Design and Implementation o f School
Improvement Projects.

Disbursementsfrom the WB

The ceiling (maximum amount) for advances to be made into the DA as well as the
minimum values for applications for direct payments and for reimbursement would be
established in the Disbursement Letter. I t is expected that eligible expenditures paid out
o f the DA be reported on a monthly basis.

Supporting documentation o f project expenditures under advances and reimbursement
method, using statements o f expenditures (SOEs) and records (e.g. invoices, receipts,
etc), would also be established in the Disbursement Letter.

Disbursements made to Education Management Committees under subcomponent 2.4,
w i l l be reported to the Bank using a specific SOE format, which w i l l include information
related to the name o f school(s) and name o f the Director, as recipient o f the funds.

All consolidated SOE documentation would be maintained b y the implementing entity
for post-review and audit purposes.

Direct payments supporting documentation will consist o f records, including copies o f
receipts, supplierkontractors invoices, etc.)

Financial management supervision during implementation

Considering the results of the assessment, the identified associated risks and the need for
technical assistance, at least during the first year, FM supervision would include on-site
visits (twice a year to the extent possible), and desk r e v i e w of i n t e r i m financial reports
and audited financial statements.

B. Assessment of the Agency's Capacity to Implement Procurement

The Bank conducted an assessment o f the capacity o f the Implementing Agency, the
Municipal Government o f L a Paz (Gobierno Municipal de La Paz-GMLP) to implement
procurement actions for the project. The assessment reviewed the organizational structure
for implementing the project and the interaction between the project staff responsible for
procurement and the GMLP' s relevant Administrative and Financial Center (Centro
Administratiuo Financiero-CAF). The assessment includes a proposed action plan to
enhance the GMLP procurement activities and to ensure that the information o f the
procurement cycle (procurement plan, bidding process, contract award, contract
execution and delivery o f goods, works and consultant services) i s kept b y the same
office.

The borrower o f the proposed loan w i l l be the Municipal Government o f L a Paz
(Gobierno Municipal de La Paz-GMLP) which i s an entity with legal and financial
autonomy. Project implementation w i l l be the responsibility o f the Municipal Office o f
Human Development (Ofcialia Mayor de Desarrollo Humano-OMDH), one of five
Department Offices (OJicialias) under the Executive Secretary's Office, which reports
directly to the Mayor o f L a Paz. The project w i l l be implemented with the regular staff
o f the OMDH, with the support o f additional consultants as needed. Procurement
activities w i l l be carried out b y the OMDH's Center for Administration and Finances
(Centro Administrativo Financiero-CAF), in coordination with the GMLP's "Direccidn
de Licitaciones y Contrataciones." The O M D H has no previous experience in Bank
procurement.

Bolivia's regulatory framework for public procurement i s dispersed among various laws
and regulations. The procurement cycle i s highly fragmented. Contracts for amounts less
than Bs. 160,000 are carried out b y the Administrative Office (Ofcina Administrativa) o f
the O M D H while contracts for amounts greater than Bs. 160,000 are carried out by the
Office o f Procurement and Contracts of the GMLP. The Administrative Office i s made
up o f the Administrative Chief, four implementation specialists, and one person in charge
o f filing. The Office o f Procurement and Contracts o f the GMLP i s led b y a Director,
and i s composed o f a Processes Unit (with seven Process Analysts), a Filing Unit and a
Secretary. A new Procurement Specialist w i l l be hired under TORS   acceptable to the Bank
and w i l l be working under the supervision of the CAF. The Office o f Procurement and
Contracts i s currently adapting an Information System (SIMAF) which w i l l be used for
both Financial Management and Procurement. This system i s expected to be fully
operational b y the end o f 2007. However, this system i s not available yet and w i l l need to
adjust to Bank requirements. As mentioned before, none o f the units has previous
experience in Bank procurement procedures.




                                              81
The chapter o f the P O M shall include, in addition to the procurement procedures, the
organization, functions and TORS o f the staff in charge o f Bank procedures, the SBDs to
be used for each procurement method, the evaluation report formats, as well as a model
o f contracts for works, goods, and consulting services procured under the project. I t w i l l
also include the composition and functions o f the evaluation committee, instructions for
managing the contract information system, a definition o f the procurement workflow
including approvers and a timetable, and instructions about the filing system. Finally, the
chapter o f the P O M w i l l incorporate as annexes the Bank's Procurement Guidelines.

        Municipality of L a Paz: Secondary Education Transformation Project

Cost Benefit Analysis

The Municipality o f L a Paz intends to enhance education quality and increase secondary
coverage and completion rates, which remain l o w despite recent improvements. The
number o f students aged 14-17 enrolled in public secondary education increased from 63
percent in 2001 to 68 percent in 2005, while the secondary dropout rate decreased from
11 percent to 8 percent and the gross secondary completion rate rose from 43 percent to
49 percent in the same period (see Table 11). Within this context, under this project, three
new schools w i l l be built, a fourth w i l l be expanded, and three more w i l l be rebuilt. The
project w i l l also provide additional pedagogic resources and improve physical and
academic learning environments to increase education quality, together with enhanced
monitoring systems and support for institutional strengthening.

Education benefits are related to the income stream generated b y better educated people,
as well as other indirect impacts, such as lower child mortality and increased political
participation. This analysis, however, w i l l focus only on labor market-related income
opportunities generated b y education based on assumptions that quality improvements
w i l l be reflected in improved student flow. While recent evidence suggests that there are
high individual returns to improved cognitive skills, and thereby education quality, we
lack the information to accurately measure the economic benefits produced b y such
improvements in quality.

Direct project impacts were estimated using a student flow model which includes school
construction and upgrading, as well as the enhanced student flow associated with the
initiatives to mitigate dropout and improve quality. According to these estimations, gross
secondary enrollment i s likely to reach 75 percent in 2010 without the project, but should
increase to 79 percent with this project, which w i l l assure secondary education for 2,986
additional youths per year. Moreover, the project should generate a reduction in the
secondary dropout rate b y 2 additional percent points and an increase in the gross
secondary completion rate b y almost 2 additional percent points.

The economic benefits o f increased levels o f education were estimated using household
survey information, under the assumption that earning and working profiles would be the
same for future cohorts. According to the household surveys, increases in education lead
to increases in earnings, and higher education (university and others) i s largely the most
important source o f earning gains (Figure 3). Secondary education increases income, but
differences between those with only secondary and those with only primary education
minor. On the other hand, having secondary education also makes access to higher
education possible, and the average income o f those with tertiary education is almost
three times the amount o f those with only secondary education.

An important issue to take into account i s how to value the benefits o f education for those
who do not participate in the labor market, such as (educated) women. For instance, if a
woman chooses not to participate in the labor market, we can conclude that she values
her time at least as much as what she would be earning if she were working. However, if
she i s kept from participating in the labor market b y cultural, familial or institutional
barriers, she would be prevented from enjoying the economic benefits o f education. As i t
i s impossible to assign appropriate weights to this hypothesis, this analysis does not take
into account the benefits from education that accrue to those people who are not working.
Within this context, the working probability profiles shown in Figure 4 allow us to
estimate the working population by age. Secondary and higher education also have an
effect on the probability o f being employed, but as shown b y Figure 4, the differences are
not very large.

Using the information on the flow o f secondary school graduates and the resulting
difference in their incomes, calculation o f the private rate o f return i s straightforward.
The income stream behaves as expected-it reflects the project-linked benefits as well as
the private cost in terms o f forgone wages while youth are studying. After completing
their studies, however, young people begin earning more and their income in turn
becomes higher than those who did not finish secondary school (see Figure 5). In line
with this result, Table 12 shows that the private internal rate o f return i s over 10 percent


                                                                   89
and the net present value o f the income stream i s positive when considering different
discount rates.

In addition to the forgone income o f youth who stay in school rather than work, the
economic social cost o f the project w i l l include the direct costs of the project and the
recurrent costs triggered in secondary and higher education. The direct costs o f the
project add up to US$10 million (Bs 80 million) financed by IDA over a three-year
schedule beginning in 2007.

The main recurrent cost in the secondary level will be linked to new teachers and
administrative personnel that w i l l be hired: 54 additional teachers and 12 administrative
staff in all. New teachers and administrators begin at the lowest current category
(Quintu), but they progress through the pay scale up to the second category, where they
reach the average teacher income. For example, teachers' monthly salary increases from
Bs 965 at the lowest level to about Bs 1300. Teachers and administrative pay scales are
also augmented b y three bonuses that add Bs 2815 per year to base salaries (Bonos
Fusidn, a1 Cumplimiento y Econdmico).

Costs associated with maintenance, water and electricity are also estimated, assuming
that their cost-student ratios remain constant at 2006 levels. I t i s also assumed that the
project w i l l trigger other administrative costs o f about Bs 500,000 per year to maintain
activities related to student incentives and the student progress assessments.

T o estimate the cost o f higher education generated by the project, i t is assumed that 47
percent o f secondary graduates enter the public university, but only 60 percent o f them
finish their degrees in seven years. In L a Paz, 47 percent of the population aged 30-45 has
at least one year of higher education and 60 percent o f those had more than four years o f
higher education. Given that data on marginal higher education costs are unavailable, i t i s
also assumed that the average costs add approximately Bs 3700 per student per year.

Direct costs and foregone student income are the most important costs in the short run,
but secondary and tertiary recurrent costs became more important in the medium term
and follow an upward trend (see Table 13). With this information, calculations show that
the breakeven point occurs after 22 years o f project implementation, and the 40-year
internal rate o f return i s 6 percent.

Financial Sustainability

Tax revenues increased from 26 percent of GDP in 2005 to 33 percent o f GDP in 2006,
mainly due to the new hydrocarbon policy, but also because o f an increase in tax
collection efficiency. Public expenditures were contained generating a fiscal surplus.
Additionally, Bolivia benefited from the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI),
reducing i t s external debt from about 50 percent o f GDP to close to 20 percent. The
Municipality o f L a Paz i s the only municipality to have a formal risk assessment.
According to Fitch, L a Paz i s rated as A (bol) with a stable outlook (January 2007), due
to cautious financial management, a decreasing debt-to-income ratio (income increased
40 percent between 2001 and 2005), and a propitious economic environment in both the
municipality and the department.

In this context, both the Central Government as well as the municipality w i l l have enough
resources to cover the new obligations triggered by this project. Teachers and other
personnel to be hired w i l l cost the Central Government Bs 1.5 million in wages and
bonuses each year, representing a small fraction o f the total cost of current education
investments (about 7 percent o f GDP). The new infrastructure w i l l require maintenance
and service provision covered b y the municipality. Nevertheless, the total recurrent cost
to be covered b y the municipality represents less than 40 percent o f the total cost linked
to this project.

 Annex 10: Safeguards: (Environmental Assessmentnndigenous/SocialAssessment)
        Municipality of L a Paz: Secondary Education Transformation Project

The World Bank Safeguard policies applicable to this project are the Environmental
Assessment Policy, the Indigenous Peoples Policy, and the Social Assessment. The
following paragraphs describe how the project w i l l fully comply with these policies.

Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01)

The project has been classified under Category B as i t w i l l finance the construction o f
schools and/or the addition or rehabilitation o f classrooms, bathrooms and other facilities
in existing sites.

The Municipality has established that all land designated for construction, and all
facilities designated for reconstruction pertain to the Municipality, and as such no
resettlement w i l l be necessary. Furthermore, all land titles are in place and all
architectural plans have been drawn up.

 n
I preparation for the proposed project, and in line with World Bank requirements, the
Municipality carried out an environmental assessment to identify potential environmental
impacts and to design appropriate measures for mitigating such impacts. The following i s
a summary o f the resulting document.

Technical Considerations. In terms o f the technical aspects o f the project, the
assessment defines all o f the distinct activities related to construction and renovation o f a
total o f 308 classrooms and the demolition o f existing units. These have enabled the
GMLP to develop a Program for Prevention and Mitigation (PPM) and Plan for the
Application o f Environmental Monitoring (PASA) to prevent and mitigate the possible
environmental impacts that may result from the project.

Legal Considerations. The assessment carries out a political and legal review o f the
existing national and municipal legislation and norms set to preserve and control the
environment. The Municipality w i l l follow all requirements set out by Bolivian L a w
1333 and Rule 24176, both o f which pertain to the environment. During the phase o f
project implementation, the Office o f Environmental Quality (DCA), within the
Municipality, w i l l take the responsibility for ensuring that the project meets all o f i t s legal
obligations, complying with all o f the recommendations o f the PPM and PASA and
current environmental legislation. The D C A w i l l coordinate with the Office o f Works
Supervision (USO) on issues o f prevention, mitigation, and labor safety.

Possible Impacts and Suggested Mitigation Measures. In order to develop an effective
plan to mitigate potential environmental impacts, the assessment has compiled a l i s t o f
the activities that are potentially damaging to the local environment and possible
mitigation strategies. Table 14 outlines the possible environmental impacts and suggested
mitigation measures.

Previous Assessments. I addition, during the preparation o f a previous project, the
                         n
Environmental Manual o f the National Social and Productive Investment Fund (MunuaZ
de Buenas Pra'cticas Ambientah) which, in 2002, received a no objection from the
World Bank and has been used during the execution o f the ongoing projects financed b y
IDA, was revised to include number o f environmental concerns summarized below:

EnvironmentalConsiderationsin Urban Areas

   0   Promote that the expansions, repairs and/or new constructions o f educational
       centers are set at a distance from areas o f high motor vehicle traffic that endangers
       the physical integrity o f the student population.

   0   Promote that the investments are carried out in urban areas far from noisy places.
       This w i l l contribute to a smaller population affected by noise pollution.

       The expansions, repairs, and/or new constructions should take into account water
       drainage services, in areas with intense rains, when these affect the infrastructure
       or integrity o f the students. Not only should the function o f the classrooms,
       workshops, and/or halls be considered, but also investments should be allocated in
       order to ensure the defense and stability o f the constructions.

   0    n
       I the case o f new constructions, an effort should be made to locate the
       educational centers in places that do not endanger the physical and emotional
       integrity o f the students through the presence o f social problems such as
       delinquency, gang activity, etc.

       The absence o f natural dangers and geotectonic risks such as geological faults,
       mudslides and rock dislodgements, should prevail in the intervention o f the
       project in order to prevent health risks and the loss o f investment in infrastructure.

Environmental Considerations in Peri-urbanAreas

   0   Dust clouds generate pulmonary diseases; therefore, locating the educational
       centers in areas with air pollution should be avoided. In these cases, the Project
       should be accompanied b y a program for dust mitigation to mitigate these
       problems.

   0   Repairs, expansions, and new constructions should be avoided in areas located in
       creeks and natural dried riverbeds with the potential danger o f landslides or soil
       movements.

       The absence o f natural dangers and geotectonic risks such as geological faults,
       mudslides and rock dislodgements, should be considered in the selection o f
       intervention alternatives.


                                             94
       In the case o f repairs, expansions, andor new constructions in unhealthy places
       (infectious areas such as: garbage dumps, septic tanks, latrines, toxic fumes from
       the burning o f refuse) a program of environmental mitigation must be included.

       The land selected for a new construction should be legally cleaned up, avoiding
       interference with other uses, such as markets, houses, cemeteries, etc.; and
       moreover i t should comply with the type o f urban zoning designed for that area.

       Preferably, the new constructions should be located in safe and accessible places,
       far from roads, making i t possible to maintain the integrity and the health o f the
       people.

Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20)

In accordance with the Indigenous Peoples Policy and due to the high concentration o f
indigenous peoples living in the Municipality o f L a Paz (60 percent o f the population),
the entire project i s classified as an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan. The following
section presents a summary o f the legal framework and key actions conducted in order to
guarantee that the indigenous communities benefit from the project.

Before the plan i s presented, i t i s worth mentioning that the Education Reform Law o f
1994 established the provision o f an Intercultural Bilingual Education system in Bolivia.
Consequently, due to the legal mandate, basic and secondary education programs
designed and implemented b y the Ministry o f Education have included an IBE conceptual
framework.

Furthermore, although the Ministry o f Education i s currently refocusing i t s priorities in
education, the Morales administration's National Development Plan i s founded on a
respect for multiculturalism. This new governance model rejects a paradigm based on
embedded colonial dynamics and aims to accurately represent the interests o f the
primarily indigenous population. Furthermore, the Constituent Assembly (Asamblea
Constituyente) i s expected to tackle fundamental issues on the structure o f the Bolivia
state and society, including increased participation o f indigenous groups. As such, the
Municipal response to education w i l l also respond to these priorities.

Background Information and Legal Framework

Constitutional framework. In 1994, Bolivia's Constitution was modified to officially
acknowledge the society's multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and multi-linguistic character.
This transcendental change, framed in the search for more democratic relationships
between the different groups, posed a challenge to the national education system with the
need for complex transformations, new guidelines, and different aims than those o f a
traditionally elitist and homogenizing education.




                                            95
Educational framework. Bolivia's current legal framework in education i s possibly one
o f the most important achievements in the last decades. After the 1955 Education Code,
no substantial changes were made until the nineties. This code aimed to extend the
systems' coverage to the rural areas and to integrate the indigenous population within the
concept o f the Bolivian "National State." Previous to the 1990s reforms, rural education
was predominantly technical and aimed to convert the indigenous people into
 "campesinos" (peasants), an economic concept that ignored ethnic and cultural
differences. Reading, writing and arithmetic were also important and everything was
taught only in Spanish. Stated simply, the positive side o f these changes was that an
ample part o f the population gained access to education which was compulsory in the
then called "basic" level, years 1 to 5 (40 percent more indigenous people entered the
system) (Contreras 1999, cited in L6pez 2004). The negative side was that the quality o f
education and i t s goals did not respect indigenous peoples' distinct needs and
characteristics (IpiAa 1996, in L6pez 2004). Diversity was seen as a "problem" that
needed to be overcome through "melting pot" schools where Euro-centric postures,
language, contents, and values dominated.

The Education Reform Law (LRE) o f 1994 substantially reflects the discussions held
during the eighties among indigenous organizations, academics, the workers' union
(COB), the rural teachers' confederation (CONMERB), and many others who criticized
the 1955 Education Code and i t s discriminatory stance and demanded profound changes.
Their proposals, experiences, and research, alongside the international advances in
education, were taken into account for the new legal framework which established
Znterculturality and Social Participation as i t s central tenets (ME 2002b; Alb6 and Anaya
2003).

The LRE's first article states that: "Bolivian education is intercultural and bilingual,
                                                                                f
because it acknowledges the country's sociocultural heterogeneity in a climate o respect
between all Bolivians, men and women. "

Article 2 establishes the goals o f Bolivian education: "To promote the practice o        f
universally recognized human values and ethical norms as well as those that are proper
o our cultures, furthering responsibility in personal decisions, the development o
 f                                                                                        f
critical thinking, the respect for human rights (...) as a basis for (...) a disposition
towards democratic life, and strengthening the social conscience o being a person and
                                                                     f
belonging to a collectivity.. .To strengthen the national identity, exalting the historical
and cultural values o the Bolivian Nation in its enormous and diverse multicultural and
                      f
multiregional richness. "

In i t s third article, i t establishes the objectives o f the education system: ( i ) "To improve
the education's quality and efJiciency by making it pertinent to the community's needs
and by extending its coverage (...) guaranteeing equality o rights for men and women, "
                                                                   f
and ( i i ) "Construct an intercultural and participative education system that allows the
access o all Bolivians to an education, without any sort o discrimination. "
           f                                                     f




                                               96
The conceptual options that underlie the law are linked to cultural re-valuing and
development, and an education aimed to construct democratic relationships based on
respect, complementation and cooperation among those who are different.

       R
The L E organizes the education system into four structures: Popular Participation,
Curriculum Organization, Curriculum and Technical Services Management, and
Resource Management. Compulsory education was extended to the entire primary level,
years 1 to 8. Among the specific dispositions for these structures, some are directly
functional to the IBE framework, mainly the creation of social participation schemes,
where the most important have been the "Consejos Educativos de Pueblos Originarios,"
known as CEPOs (Indigenous Peoples Education Councils: Aymara, Quechua, Guarani,
Amazon multiethnic and others); the construction o f a flexible and open curriculum,
guided by an intercultural approach, which establishes two language modalities:
monolingual, "in Spanish with the introduction o f a national indigenous language," and
bilingual, "in a national indigenous language as the first language and Spanish as the
second" (Art. 9), and consequently teacher training w i l l respond to these; the creation o f
school networks (rural "nuclei" and urban "networks"); and the unification o f urban and
rural education.

Educational decentralization i s another important aspect o f the reform. N o t only the
creation o f the social participation schemes and institutions (school boards, nuclei boards,
CEPOs, etc.) are a part o f this, but also the municipal governments that are responsible
for the provision and maintenance o f school infrastructure. The resources for this, among
other sources, come from the implementation of the Popular Participation law which
distributes the country's tax revenues among the municipalities.

      R
The L E challenged the traditional system profoundly. I t opened the schools' doors to
the community; i t explicitly sought to overcome the past division of two types o f
education, one for the indigenous rural people and another for the (supposedly) non-
indigenous urban; i t proposed a core curriculum to be diversified according to the local
needs; i t included the municipal governments in the implementation o f educational
changes. The IBE guidelines were present in both the curricular and the institutional
framework o f the educational policy.

Other legal instruments created to strengthen the IBE approach were:

          1999: Administrative Resolution 038/99 determined the bilingual modality was to
          be applied in districts where the indigenous language i s dominant.

          2000: Supreme Decree 25894 recognized 33 indigenous languages as official.

     0    1999: Ministerial Resolution 436/99 acknowledged the graduates o f the
           "Bachillerato Humanistic0 con mencio'n en Pedagogiu " (BHP) programI4 as
          teachers for the primary level in the bilingual modality.

14
  T h i s program exists in eight secondary schools in highly indigenousdistricts where secondary students receive basic
pedagogical training and guidelines to apply the IBE approach.



                                                          97
       2003: Ministerial Resolution 238/03 determined the official recognition o f the
       "Bilingual teacher for primary education" diploma to be extended b y IBE teacher
       training institutes.

       2004: Ministerial Resolution 0 14/04 created the Intercultural Bilingual Education
       Directorate (IBED) whose function i s to define policies for the implementation of
       IBE and ensure i t s completion, and to supervise and monitor the application o f
       IBE in classrooms.

According to the Director o f the BED, this office was created due to the weaknesses
observed in the implementation process o f the IBE approach which was limited t o
folkloric practices and empty discourse. The IBED intends to strengthen IBE
implementation both within the Ministry o f Education, in all areas linked to IBE, and
in sectors outside i t (Interview Pari, 2004).

The proposed Secondary Education Transformation Project builds o n Bolivia's
experience with the Education Reform Program (ERP), where Intercultural Bilingual
Education (IBE) and community participation have been essential elements o f the
transformation, especially in schools with an indigenous population.

The policy and strategy for transformation o f secondary education has also benefited
f r o m the creation, under the ERP, o f (i)    the Intercultural Bilingual Education
Directorate whose function i s t o define policies for the implementation o f IBE and
ensure i t s completion, and t o supervise and monitor the application o f IBE in
classrooms; (ii) "Consejos Educativos de Pueblos Originarios, " k n o w n as CEPOs
                  the
(Indigenous Peoples Education Councils: Aymara, Quechua, Guarani, Amazon
multiethnic and others) which have been in charge o f developing IBE policies and
ensuring their implementation; and (iii) National Education Council (CONED)
                                          the
chaired b y the Minister o f Education and composed o f representatives f r o m social,
indigenous, teacher, civic, academic, governmental, non governmental, church and
academic organizations.

As a result o f the ERP, important achievements in continuing to strengthen IBE in
secondary education include, among others: (i) construction o f a flexible and open
                                                  the
curriculum, guided b y an intercultural approach, which established t w o language
modalities: monolingual, "in Spanish with the introduction o f a national indigenous
language," and bilingual, "in a national indigenous language as the first language and
Spanish as the second;" (ii) conversion o f the Znstitutos Normales Superiores
                                 the
( I N S ) (eight in the Andean region and one in the Guarani region) into half IBE I N S
(Intercultural Bilingual Education I N S ) and half into monolingual. A project for t w o
more IBE I N S for the Amazon region i s in process; (iii) official recognition o f the
                                                          the
"Bilingual teacher for primary education" diploma was extended b y IBE teacher
training institutes; (iv) the creation o f school networks (rural "nuclei" and urban
"networks"); and (v) the unification o f urban and rural education.

Trends

For the proposed project, the indigenous peoples plan i s taking into consideration the
recent trends identified by several studies, research, seminars and workshops carried out
during project preparation. The most important trends are summarized below:

(a) National

Cultural identity, languages and migration. According to the 2001 census, 62 percent
o f Bolivia's adult population identifies itself with one o f the 35 indigenous ethnic groups
o f the country, specifically: 31 percent with the Quechua, 25 percent with the Aymara,
and 6 percent with the Guarani or another indigenous group. No other Latin American
country has such a high proportion o f indigenous people, except Guatemala, where
estimates indicate that between 45-50 percent o f the population i s i n d i g e n o u ~ . ' ~

Population. In the last 50 years, Bolivia's indigenous population has grown from 1.7
million people in 1992 to 3.9 million in 2001. Among young people, the age group which
has shown most growth i s precisely that which corresponds to the potential students at the
secondary level: at present 729,000 Bolivians are 14-17 years old, this i s 30 percent more
than in 1992 (compared to 16 percent more 0-3 year olds; 16 percent more 4-5 year olds;
and 24 percent more 6-13 year olds) (ME 2004a).

Poverty and illiteracy. The highest levels o f poverty are s t i l l concentrated in rural areas,
where 87 percent o f the population older than 15 identifies themselves as indigenous, and
where 91 percent are poor and 52 percent are extremely poor. When comparing the
country's departments, poverty also increases according to indigenous population: in
Potosi and Chuquisaca, both with a 75-85 percent indigenous adult population, 70-80
percent are poor and close to half o f these live in extreme poverty (INE 2001; INE-
UDAPE 2001; ME 2004a).

Languages. The 2001 census asked what language a person "learned to speak" and,
based on this criteria, established that the first language o f the population 4 years and
older was: Quechua 21 percent, Aymara 14 percent, Spanish 63 percent, 0.6 percent
Guarani, and 1 percent for other indigenous languages. This means that about 37 percent
have an indigenous language as their "mother tongue." Given that this data excludes
about 800,000 children under 4 years o f age, a group which i s proportionally higher in
rural areas than in urban areas (Population age pyramids, INE 2001), that percentage i s
higher.

L6pez (2004) states that about 60 percent of the population speaks an indigenous
language: 48 percent are bilingual (indigenous language and Spanish) and 12 percent
monolingual in the indigenous language. This leaves 40 percent that only speak Spanish.
This is similar to the data presented b y Alb6 in 1999, based on the 1992 census, that
found that 42 percent only spoke Spanish, 11 percent only spoke an indigenous language

 Other countries in the region show lower proportions: around 35 percent in Peru and Ecuador, 9-10 percent in
Mexico, and less than 3 percent in Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Colombia (Nucinkis 2005).



                                                        99
and 46 percent were bilingual. Both sources agree with the last census which indicates
that o f the total population 47 percent speaks only Spanish and 53 percent is either
bilingual, monolingual in an indigenous language, or speaks a foreign language (less than
1 percent). In urban areas, 97.5 percent speak Spanish (as monolinguals or bilinguals),
while in rural areas 30 percent do not speak Spanish (ME 2004a).

Distribution. Indigenous people are distributed throughout the entire country, in
traditional rural areas and in urban cities, and are dedicated to all sorts o f work, from
subsistence farming and hunting, and small scale entrepreneurship, all the way to
President o f the Republic and members o f the executive and legislative branches.
Though there are some more homogeneous geographical concentrations, such as that of
the Quechuas in certain regions in Potosi or the U r u s close to the Titicaca and Poop6
lakes, there i s mainly dispersion o f the indigenous people, as occurs with the Aymaras
and Quechuas who are mostly in the West, but also live in concentrated areas in different
eastern cities such as Tarija and Santa Cruz.

Students. Between 1997 and 2002, the number o f students in the bilingual modality
increased b y 157 percent, this i s from 75,896 to 192,238 students, which represent 11
percent o f the almost 1.7 million enrolled in the primary level and 26 percent o f the
students enrolled in rural areas. In comparison with the coverage o f the Experimental
Bilingual Education Project (EBEP) which preceded the Reform Law and provided
services to 8,300 students in 1994 (from grades 1-5 in 114 schools), the increase has been
enormous: 1,756 percent, which shows the magnitude o f the impulse given to this
modality through the Reform Program. However, in comparison with the socio linguistic
characteristics o f the population, this 11 percent o f primary students i s s t i l l low. The
modality has not been extended to the initial and secondary levels.

Learning achievements. The results in standardized Language and Mathematics tests,
applied in the indigenous language in a sample o f monolingual (only Spanish) and
bilingual (with Aymara and Quechua) rural schools, by Bolivia's Quality Measurement
System (SIMECAL) in 1997, showed that although the differences were not significant,
many indigenous students had relatively better achievements in both tests when they were
in IBE schools than when they were in Spanish schools.

(b) Municipal

Population. Despite i t s urban nature, L a Paz has a large indigenous population.
According to the 2001 census, over 60 percent o f the population in L a Paz self-identified
as indigenous: 50 percent as Aymara, 10 percent as Quechua, and 0.5 percent as other
indigenous.

Language: Bilingualism i s common in L a Paz where 29 percent o f the population speaks
both Spanish and one indigenous language, either Quechua or Aymara. Furthermore, 16
percent o f the population claims to have learned Aymara as a mother tongue, and 2.5
percent have learned Quechua.




                                             100
Educational framework. Under the current national education framework, IBE has been
implemented only in rural areas, has not reached urban areas, and as such has not been
implemented in schools in the municipality of L a Paz.

The Consultation Process for Improving Secondary Education (Social Assessment)

Previous to preparation o f the present project, the Ministry o f Education and Culture
carried out a departmental, regional and national consultation process as part o f
preparation for the Multi-Annual Education Strategy. The strategy was meant to be the
primary governing tool for the Ministry's 2004-2015 Multi-annual Operational Program
(POMA) and the principal basis for definition o f a new Education Law. In addition to this
broad consultation process, the ME has financed several research studies and the
implementation o f some innovative experiences.

Research studies on current secondary education and implementation o first          f
innovative experiences. In total, 13 studies that consistently included IBE criteria were
carried out b y local institutions and b y well known national and international education
consultants on secondary education covering: (i)   programs and curriculum development
and alternatives; (ii)  pedagogical and methodological requirements; ( i ) i i institutional
setting and organization; (iv) social expectations and demand for secondary education;
(v) school management at the secondary level; and (vi) teacher's pre-service and in-
service training.

National and Departmental Consultation Workshops. Given the experience gained in
primary education and that the transformation o f secondary education represents a new
challenge, a wide process o f consultation and discussion with educational actors has been
coordinated b y the ME: the main activities conducted can be summarized as follows: (i)
six national workshops with the participation o f 800 teachers were held to discuss
curricular contents and methodologies: a national workshop on physics and five regional
workshops on Mathematics and Language education; (ii) international seminar was
                                                              an
held on history and social sciences in secondary education where 100 teachers and
members o f the SEDUCAs from the entire country participated and agreed on the need to
update and reduce contents, the importance o f including traditional knowledge o f
indigenous cultures, the need for new materials and bibliography; and (iii)    national and
regional workshops where the draft proposal for the transformation o f secondary
education, its vision, mission, strategy and objectives, were extensively discussed.

As part of this process, a national-level workshop was held in the city o f Cobija, in
November 2004, and eight departmental congresses also took place, with the purpose o f
addressing issues in secondary education. Many representatives f r o m the social sectors
took part, including members o f indigenous, popular (including teachers), NGOs,
churches, parents, students, representatives from the productive sector, professional
organizations, private and public enterprises, universities, police and military institutions
and governmental organizations. The conclusions emphasized the critical state o f
secondary education and the need to intervene in the following areas: intercultural and
bilingual education (IBE), creation of a flexible curriculum integrating technical and



                                            101
vocational education and general education, democratization o f access and coverage, use
o f a constructivist pedagogy in secondary education, commitment to an education based
solidly on values and citizenship, and the possibility o f making secondary education
obligatory, or at least the first two years.

The New Operation. I response to the diagnosis and the consultation process described
                        n
above, the new operation intends to initiate the necessary transformation o f the secondary
level, taking into consideration successful experiences. Some o f the lessons learned from
the primary education project that the Ministry considers particularly important, are:


       The need for more participation b y different social actors, both in decisions and
       responsibilities, in the understanding that the transformation i s not a simple
       continuation o f the ERP, but rather seeks to construct an education system
       oriented at serving a society that needs to overcome its internal colonialism.

       The successful strategy o f the educational projects in the primary level (in
       indigenous districts, rural nuclei and urban networks) needs to be extended to
       secondary schools and to be used to strengthen the link between the social
       participation approach and the education transformation process, reflected
       especially in the diversification o f the curriculum.

   0   The collective construction o f the new curriculum designs, both for secondary
       education and teacher training, where interculturality and productivity-oriented
       learning are essential, requires more dialogue and negotiation with peoples from
       the different cultures. Diversification o f the curriculum needs to be addressed
       from the beginning.

   0   The IBE approach requires well prepared teachers who know the language, the
       culture and the specific needs and possibilities o f the communities.

   0   Interculturality needs to be strengthened; although changes have been made in
       primary education, the indigenous peoples still live in very unequal conditions, far
       from the objectives sought in the framework o f a more democratic society.

       Sustainability depends on reaching consensus in society, therefore, more
       communication and dissemination actions need to accompany the transformation
       process.

       The proposed changes have to be understood as a new phase that rescues the
       positive aspects o f the previous phase but also overcomes i t s weaknesses; public
       acknowledgement o f these has to be a part o f the new stage.

       Secondary education needs urgent attention after having given priority to primary
       education for so many years (ME 2004c, 2005).

The results o f the analytical work on the Indigenous People, the wide consultation
process conducted nationwide (Social Assessment), as well as the lessons learned from
previous World Bank projects have been incorporated in every component and activity o f
the project.

The Consultation Process for Improving Education in L a Paz

A Municipal-level consultation process was conducted as part o f the preparation o f the
Municipal Development Plan (Plan de Desarrollo Municipal--JAYMA) for 2007-20 11,
and as a complement to the Municipality's Statistical Dossier. The survey aimed to
understand citizens' attitudes and demands regarding education and the services provided
b y the Municipality. Antecedents to this process include a consultation previously carried
out at the departmental, regional and national levels, conducted b y the Ministry o f
Education in 2003 and 2004 in preparation for the Multi-annual Operational Program
(POMA) for 2004-2015.

Survey Carried Out by the Municipality o La Paz. In June and July o f 2006, in
                                                f
preparation for the Municipal Development Plan 2007-2011 (Plan de Desarrollo
Municipal--JAYMA), and as a complement to the Municipality's Statistical Dossier, the
Municipality o f L a Paz conducted a study o f citizen perceptions and demands regarding a
number o f municipal services, including education.

Questionnaires were completed b y a total o f 4,048 people over the age o f 18 in the 21
urban districts and two rural districts o f Zongo and Hampaturi. The sample has a
confidence interval o f 95 percent for each district, and a margin o f error o f 8 percent. In a
series o f workshops, Juntas Escolares, school directors, teachers, and parents discussed
the results and raised the following concerns regarding the educational sector:

   1. The infrastructure and equipment in the educational system are not specialized
      according to level, and are deficient, especially in the case o f secondary.
   2. Students receive insufficient technical and general instruction.
   3. There i s a rapid deterioration o f school furnishings.
   4. Insufficient preparation o f directors, teachers and training, which produces a l o w
      level o f education quality.
   5. L o w participation and collaboration among community level actors:
      representatives o f school networks, Juntas Escolares, teachers, and students.

As the Municipality's primary mandate in terms o f educational services deals with
infrastructure, equipment, supplies and school breakfast programs, the majority o f the
questions focused on these issues. However, results show that respondents are also
concerned with other issues o f quality. That said, considering the Municipality's
responsibilities and the nature o f the questions, the majority o f respondents expressed the
most interest in the state o f educational infrastructure and equipment. According to the
surveys collected, citizens expressed the following concerns.




                                              103
   A disconnect exists between the total number o f classrooms versus the number o f
   classrooms required b y the previous Education Reform Program. The Municipality
   exhibits a deficit in the number o f classrooms, primarily at the preschool and
   secondary levels, o f around 79 and 98 classrooms respectively (preliminary data). In
   fact, citizen opinions reflect this reality. In terms o f demand for educational
   infrastructure, the survey revealed that 66.8 percent o f the population considered the
   number o f schools in their district to be deficient, while 70.6 percent considered the
   number of classrooms to be lacking. Additionally, 76.9 percent o f respondents
   classified the infrastructure o f the public schools in their area as regular, bad, or very
   bad.

   Survey respondents also expressed concerns with the quality and amount o f school
   materials. Seventy-seven percent o f those surveyed believed that schools lacked
   enough benches, blackboards, and other materials. Furthermore, 8 1 percent
   considered the equipment in the public schools to be inadequate.

As such, in terms o f both the technical and perceived reality, i t i s evident that educational
equipment and infrastructure i s lacking, and requires an investment to improve i t s
physical condition.

Consultation Process Carried Out by the OMDH with Project Stakeholders. In addition,
on M a y 4,2007, the O M D H held a workshop to present the project to stakeholders and to
receive their feedback. The workshop was attended b y a total o f 45 participants,
comprising a number o f educational stakeholders, including parents, teachers,
coordinators of the educational networks (redes educativas), presidents o f parent councils
(juntas escolares), and school directors from the macro-districts chosen for the project, as
well as the head human development officer (OJiciaZ Mayor) and other personnel from
the OMDH. Participants offered commentaries, suggestions, and questions regarding the
project, focusing on a number o f issues. Among the most important concerns raised
involved project administration and fiduciary oversight, definition o f indicators and
timing o f the project cycle, and the role o f educational units (schools) in carrying out
obligations within the School Improvement Projects, how educational units would be
chosen for participation in SIPS, and the financial mechanisms for carrying out SIPS.

Workshop participants also requested that special measures be taken to preserve those
educational infrastructures o f historical value (patrimonio histdrico) and that the project
help strengthen the educational management capacity o f the educational networks, as the
primary organizing body o f the municipality.

Finally, participants expressed a need to develop an orientation guide to the project and
the various stakeholders' roles within it. In general, the participants expressed enthusiasm
and interest in the project.
