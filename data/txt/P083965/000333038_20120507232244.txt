                              PROJECT
                                 RESTRUCTURING PAPER


           A. SUMMARY

1. The proposed changes and rationale are as follows:

   A revision of the scope and description of some Project sub-components to respond to
    Project, municipal and country realities, including the new Education Law, Avelino Siñani –
    Elizardo Perez (No.070), which was passed in December 2010.

   A reallocation of funds among categories consistent with the increase in cost of construction,
    furniture and equipment and a consequent reduction in the cost and scope of Project activities
    relating to the quality of education and institutional strengthening.

   A revision of the Results Matrix to reflect the adjustments in Project activities. New
    indicators have been introduced to monitor the number of direct Project beneficiaries.

   A six-month extension of the closing date so that the remaining (74) planned classrooms can
    be completed.

           B. PROJECT STATUS

2. The Project was approved by the Board on October 9, 2007. It was declared effective on
December 4, 2008, due to significant delays in the signing of the Financing Agreement, approval
by Congress, and the signing of the Subsidiary Agreement—which allows funds to be transferred
to La Paz. Significant progress has been achieved in the areas of access and retention, quality of
education, and institutional strengthening. In particular:

   Four new school buildings have been completed and furniture and equipment delivered. All
    of them are operating with teachers and administrative staff provided by the Ministry of
    Education.

   The after school tutoring Program for At-Risk Students was implemented in 2009-2011 with
    positive results and increasing demand from parents and students. The program benefited
    more 9,500 students.

   The Awareness-Raising Program on Civic Values was implemented in 2010 and 2011,
    having covered topics on sexuality, citizenship, gender, human rights and cultural issues. One
    Center for High Performance (CARE) was inaugurated in mid-2009 and is now fully
    operational. The Strengthening of Education Communities Program financed 92 School
    Improvement Plans (SIP) in 2011.Three dilapidated school buildings were reconstructed, and
    furnishing and equipment have been provided. Twenty one classrooms were completed in


                                                1
    existing schools, eight are under construction and the final designs for another 66 classrooms
    have been completed.

   The Integrated Information System for Project Monitoring and Financial Administration
    (SIMAF) has been adapted for Project administration and is currently providing accurate
    information and reports. Capacity building within the executing agency, the Human
    Development Office (OMDH), has also taken place in terms of provision of equipment,
    staffing and technical training for Project implementation.

3.    Construction, furniture and equipment have been more costly than anticipated due to delays
in Project implementation and a significant increase in the cost of materials and labor in the years
following Project approval. This has resulted in reduced budget for the education quality and
institutional strengthening aspects of the Project. Project effectiveness delays were a factor and,
more recently, a second series of delays due to new institutional arrangements and infrastructure
regulations issued by La Paz in May 2010, which established a Municipal Infrastructure Office
(OMI) independent from the OMDH.

4.    In addition, the environment in which the Project is operating has changed. The Legislative
Assembly passed a new Education Law (Avelino Siñani – Elizardo Perez (No.070)) in December
2010, creating a new school structure: six grades at the primary level and six at the secondary
level (instead of the previous eight at the primary level and four at the secondary level).

           C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Components

5. As a result of increased infrastructure costs, it has been necessary to scale back some Project
activities and adjust the description of various Sub-components. The Project has addressed
reductions in available budget for the quality and institutional strengthening components by
developing innovative approaches to advance the Civic Values Awareness Program and Centers
for High Performance, while, in some cases, increasing the number of beneficiaries. In
Component 1, the approach for the Program for At-Risk Students was adjusted. In Component 2,
the Infrastructure Maintenance Program and the Strengthening of Education Communities
Program have been scaled back and the strategy of intervention of the Centers for High
Performance and the Awareness-Raising Program on Civic Values was updated. In Component
3, the Student Assessment Program has been eliminated since this activity is under the sole
responsibility of the Ministry of Education. The grades of students benefiting from the Project
have been revised to reflect the grade classification in Law No. 070. The major changes are as
follows:

Component 1:

    a) The Component has been renamed “Access to Education? in order to reflect that it
       focuses on expanding coverage. The Sub-component on infrastructure has been revised to
       clarify the number of new schools buildings financed and the number of existing schools
       where new classrooms are being built. The Program for At-Risk Students provides direct
       pedagogical support to students at risk of education failure. Originally the Project
       planned for this support to be provided by pedagogical experts contracted by the
                                                 2
      Municipality or by institutions already providing such services. This Sub-component has
      been restructured to finance direct hiring of experienced, skilled teachers through the
      Project to develop remedial courses and offer them through a partnership with the
      Municipal Training Center (CCAM). In addition, in the original design of the Project, at-
      risk students were identified as those exhibiting two or more years of age/grade distortion
      in the last grades of primary and the first two grades of secondary. The eligibility criteria
      for the Program has changed, at-risk students are defined as those with very poor or
      failing grades in the first quarter of the school year (those with a grade of 39 or less out of
      70 points in Mathematics or Language).

Component 2:

   a) The School Infrastructure Maintenance Program has been scaled back to focus on
      clarifying roles and responsibilities. This is because the Municipality is implementing a
      regular maintenance program, which has its own budget and also includes the active
      involvement of School Boards, made up of parents, teachers and students, obviating the
      need for a maintenance program financed by the Project, as originally envisioned.

   b) The original strategy of the Civic Values Awareness Program was focused on developing
      workshops and educational materials to raise parent, teacher, and student awareness of
      sensitive issues that affect students in La Paz. This Sub-component has been restructured
      to set up a Diploma (post-graduate) program in civic values for teachers, principals and
      municipal staff, to be complemented by workshops, student dialogues, classroom
      projects, student awareness days and publications, in order to reach a wider audience.

   c) The Project originally envisioned financing up to seven Pedagogical Resource Platforms
      (PRPs). Given budget constraints, the restructured Sub-component will only finance one.
      Also, the PRP name was changed to Centers of High Performance in 2011, in order to
      distinguish them from other initiatives and extend their services to include more tools for
      achieving education quality and improvement in student academic performance. The new
      name has been integrated into the Project description.

   d) The Strengthening of Education Communities Program has been scaled back because it
      entails a heavy, unremunerated workload for principals and teachers, leading to low
      commitment to the Program. As a result, the transaction costs for the Municipality to
      comply with adequate accountability have been higher than anticipated. In addition, the
      legal, administrative and internal control requirements made transfers lengthy and
      complex - because direct transfers are not contained in the current legal framework thus
      there are no mechanisms in place with which to make them. This situation was further
      compounded by weaknesses identified in the Equipos de Gestión (EGE), and a largely
      ineffective approach by the external firm hired for providing training and assistance to
      the EGEs. Therefore, changes were required in SIPs implementation. This Sub-
      component therefore has been restructured to allow purchases and payments for SIPs to
      be handled by the OMDH.


   Component 3:


                                                3
        a) The initially planned Assessment of Student Learning Program is out of the scope of
           municipal responsibility1 and this Sub-component has therefore been eliminated.

6. The revised Project Description is:

     Component 1: Access to Education

      Promote expanded coverage in primary and secondary education through:

      a) the construction and equipping (with furniture, audiovisual and/or computer equipment)
         of four new schools with classrooms, sanitary facilities and administrative offices; and
         (ii) the construction of additional classrooms in about twelve existing schools; and

      b) the development of an intervention providing direct pedagogical support to At-Risk
         Students in secondary education (grades 1-4) to ensure that they remain in the education
         system to complete their studies and improve their critical thinking and communication
         skills, including the carrying out of a targeted supplementary academic and skills-
         building course provided by pedagogical experts and offered after school or as a
         complement to the school day.

     Component 2: Quality of Education

      Support the La Paz to improve the quality of education with a focus on primary and
      secondary education through:

      a) the improvement of learning environments including, inter alia: (i) the reconstruction and
         equipping (with furniture, audiovisual and/or computer equipment) of three dilapidated
         school buildings, classrooms, sanitary facilities and administrative offices; and (ii) the
         development of a framework on school infrastructure maintenance that clarifies the roles
         and responsibilities of La Paz, principals, teachers and students;

      b) the design and delivery of programs for secondary education (grades 3-6) teachers,
         school directors, and representatives from the Juntas Escolares on civic values-related
         issues defined by La Paz, including gender equity, health and sexuality, multiculturalism,
         emotional intelligence and proper care of school buildings, through inter alia: (i) the
         development of a post-graduate (Diploma) program for principals, teachers and staff of
         the OMDH education unit;; (ii) the carrying out of workshops for teachers,
         administrators, members of the Juntas Escolares and parents addressing the above issues;
         (iii) the development of dialogue sessions and classroom projects with students; (iv) the
         publication of a small series of booklets covering the awareness programs themes; and
         (v) the development of an interactive website for use by teachers, directors, parents and
         students;

      c) the establishment of a Center of High Performance (CARE) to provide access to science
         and computer labs, learning materials, and carry out awareness-raising workshops and

                                                            4
       pedagogical reinforcement to At-Risk Students through the financing of the CARE
       operational costs and the provision of goods; and

    d) the design and implementation of annual school level strategic plans, including: (i) the
       carrying out of training and support to school management committees in the
       development of the School Improvement Plans (SIPs); (ii) the development of a manual
       outlining the basic steps for developing and implementing the SIPs; and (iii) the
       financing of SIPs through: (A) the transfer of a School Grant to selected schools; or (B)
       OMDH, as the case may be.

   Component 3: Education Management and Institutional Strengthening

    Strengthen management capacity at the municipal and school levels to facilitate actions to
    improve access to and completion of a quality secondary education, through:

    a) (i) the adaptation of the SIMAF; (ii) the provision of equipment, materials, and
       consultants necessary for carrying out Project management and implementation; (iii) the
       financing of operational costs related to Project implementation; and (iv) the contracting
       of auditing services to carry out annual Project audits;

    b) the design and implementation of an impact evaluation of Component 1 (b) activities to
       measure their effects; and

    c) the strengthening of La Paz’s capacity to enhance its financial and accounting practices,
       revise its procurement and financial management norms in accordance with international
       standards, and carry out other activities related to improving its performance in the
       education sector, including : (i) the purchasing of equipment and furniture for the OMDH
       education unit; (ii) the provision of technical assistance for professional development for
       the OMDH education unit staff; and (iii) the design and implementation of an
       informational campaign publicizing the Project and its activities, including the
       establishment and maintenance of a webpage publicly accessible.

Results/Indicators

7.   While the PDO will remain the same, there have been several changes in the Project
Outcome Indicators and Intermediate Results Indicators to better reflect Project objectives and
outputs, and to ensure measurability through Ministry of Education or OMDH databases. (See
Annex 1 for the revised Results Matrix).

8.    Two of the four Project Development Outcomes Indicators have been revised, and
baselines and targets of the remaining two have been changed. Baselines have been calculated
for 2008, the year prior to the start of Project implementation, as have targets for 2012, to reflect
the revised Project timeframe. (See Box 1 for details on the changes).

Institutional Arrangements

11. New institutional arrangements and corresponding infrastructure regulations issued by La
Paz have impacted institutional arrangements for the Project. In the original institutional
arrangements, the OMDH was directly responsible for the execution of the Project through its
Municipal Department of Education (Dirección Municipal de Educación, DME) and its Unit of
Infrastructure and Equipment (UIE). In 2010 a Municipal Office of Infrastructure (OMI),
independent from the other Oficialias including the OMDH, was created with responsibility over
all infrastructure activities of the GAMLP, eliminating the OMDH UIE. In the revised
institutional arrangements the OMDH continues to be responsible for Project coordination and
execution, though Component 1 on civil works is carried out by the OMI. The institutional and
implementation arrangements for activities other than civil works remain unchanged.

Financing

15. Project Costs. The revised Project costs are shown in Table 1 below. The revised costing
reflects the changes in the components. Unit costs for construction have increased due to
significant increases in the cost of materials and subsequent inflation. The cost of constructing a
classroom went from US$5,392 in 2007 to US$7,733 in 2011. The cost of furniture increased
from US$39.62 in 2007 to US$81.43 in 2011. The unit cost of computer and audio-visual
equipment has increased from US$18.8 in 2007 to US$36.3 in 2011. This has increased the
amount of financing needed for Component 1 and reduced the amount available for Components
2 and 3.

16. Reallocation. The categories of items financed by the Credit have been revised to align the
balance not yet executed with the revised Project Components 1, 2 and 3 (called Parts A, B and
C, respectively, in the Amendment to the Financing Agreement). Because of the increase in unit
costs for construction, furniture, computers and audio-visual equipment, there has been an
increase in funds allocated to Category 1. The revised allocation of proceeds is shown in Table 3
below.

Financial Management

18. All financial management arrangements established in the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) remain with one exception. The exception relates to the financing of School Improvement
Plans under Component 2, which had originally been envisioned to take place through the
transfer of a school grant to selected schools. However, legal, administrative and internal control
requirements made transfers lengthy and complex. In addition, weaknesses identified at the
school level (Equipos de Gestion), and a not very successful accompanying mechanism provided
by the external firm contracted for this purpose, led to a decision where purchases and payments
are now handled centrally by the implementing entity (OMDH).

Implementation Schedule

19. The implementation of most Component 2 activities, the Program for At-Risk Students, the
Civic Values Program and Strengthening Education Communities Program, were completed in
2011. Support to CARE under Component 2 will continue through Project closing. All school
construction, with the exception of 74 new classrooms in existing schools, has been completed.
The designs for all of these classrooms have been approved by the Bank. Civil works began in
March 2012 on 8 of these classrooms and are expected to be completed by December 2012 if
there are no delays because of the rainy season or other issues. Civil works are expected to begin
on the other 66 classrooms between the beginning of May 2012 and mid-July 2012, and to be
completed by end-January 2013.

Closing Date

20. The implementation period has been increased by six months, extending the closing date to
March 31, 2013 (from September 30, 2012), primarily to ensure completion of planned
classroom construction under Component 1 and also to allow adequate time to finish an impact
evaluation under Component 3 and to continue support to CARE. This is the second extension
of the closing date. The first took place in December 2010.

            D. Appraisal Summary

Economic and Financial Analysis

21.     The cost benefit analysis has been updated to take into account the revised Project
indicators. According to a student flow model, up until the end of Project execution, additional
infrastructure will make possible the enrollment of 360 extra students and quality improvements
will avoid 652 failures and 510 dropouts (see Table 5).

Table 5: Project Impact on Selected Secondary Indicators
                                             2010        2011       2012         2013         2014
 Additional number of enrolled students          215        257        269          311          360
 Accumulated number of dropouts avoided         -128       -228       -287         -439         -510
 Accumulated number of failures avoided         -203       -301       -418         -534         -652

22.    Following the methodology of the original analysis, the benefits were estimated using
age-earning and age-working probability profile estimated from the household survey. This
allows for estimating the impact of higher education on the probability of working and on future
earnings. According to the estimations, more education—in particular higher education—leads to
higher earnings but has a minor negative impact on the probability of working.

23.     Applying this information, calculating the        Table 6: Private Returns to Project
private rate of return is straightforward—it results
from the project-linked benefits minus the private        40 year internal rate of return (Percentage)   11.9
costs in terms of forgone wages while studying.           45 year internal rate of return (Percentage)   12.4
Table 6 shows that the private internal rate of           50 year internal rate of return (Percentage)   12.7
return is over 10 percent and the net 2007 value
                                                          Net 2007 Value at 4% (Bs Million)              87

                                                          Net 2007 Value at 6% (Bs Million)              39
discount rates.                                           Net 2007 Value at 8% (Bs Million)              17

24.     With the private income difference established, the Project’s cost-benefit analysis
includes the direct costs of the Project—US$10 million IDA financing over 2008-2012—as well
as the recurrent costs triggered. The main recurrent cost at the secondary level is linked to the
new teachers and administrative personnel that will be hired. New teachers and administrators
begin at the lowest category (Quinta) and they progress up through the pay scale following the
existing rules. The payment of three bonuses (Fusión, al Cumplimiento y Económico) is also
included. The costs associated with maintenance, water and electricity are also taken into
account as well as the administrative costs the Project triggers related to student incentives and
student progress assessments. To estimate the cost of higher education, it is assumed that 47
percent of secondary graduates enter public universities, and that only 60 percent of them finish
their degrees within seven years. Given that data on marginal higher education costs are
                                                   12
unavailable, it is assumed that the average costs add approximately Bs 3,700 per student per
year.

25.     Direct costs and foregone income are the most important costs in the short run, while
secondary and tertiary recurrent costs become more important in the medium term, as do
revenues (see Table 7). With this information, calculations show that the break-even point occurs
after 2028 and the internal rate of return attains 4.5 percent.
