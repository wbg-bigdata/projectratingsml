PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
TURKEY: KEBAN TRANSMISSION PROJECT (LOAN 568-TU) AND
TEK POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT (LOAN 763-TU)
PREFACE
This report presents the results of a performance audit of the
Keban Transmission and TEK1/ Power Transmission projects, for which Loans
568-TU and 763-TU were approved in October 1968 and June 1971 in the sums of
US$25 million and US$24 million respectively.      Loan 568-TU was closed in
August, 1974 and Loan 763-TU in June, 1976. Both loans were fully disbursed.
The Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) consists of a Project
Performance Audit Memorandum (PPAM) prepared by the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED) and a Project Completion Report (PCR) prepared by the Europe,
Middle East and North Africa Regional Office.    TEK's  final reports on Loans
568-TU and 763-TU are included as part of the PCR (Attachments 1 and 2). The
two projects have been covered in a combined PPAR since they. shared common
institutional and financial objectives and the physical works in both cases
were part of an integrated development of the national transmission grid; in
the event, the projects also faced similar experiences and problems which are
especially noteworthy in so far as they cover an important period in the
evolution of the power sector in Turkey and they lead to a number of general
conclusions regarding the role of the Bank in that evolution.
A first draft of the PCR was submitted to OED in June 1978, taking
into account information gathered during a completion mission to Turkey in
January 1977, the final reports written by the borrower in January 1977, and
supplementary information provided by the borrower on later occasions.      OED
reviewed this first draft and discussed it with the government and the Bor-
rower in November 1978, durin     the course of a country visit carried out
for OED's Supervision Study!/. Subsequently, OED suggested a number of
ways in which the PCR should be modified; in December, 1980, the Region
revised the PCR and further minor changes were made in the PCR during the
auditing process.   -
OED has reviewed the final version of the PCR, the Appraisal and
President's Reports, the minutes of the Board discussions, the loan documents,
supervision reports and other documents in Bank files. Based upon this
1/   Turkiye Elektrik Kurumu (the Turkish Electricity Authority).
2/   Operational  Policy Review:   The  Supervision of Bank Projects (Report
No. 2858 of February, 1980).



review, discussions with Bank staff, the findings of the Supervision Study and
the discussions which took place with the government and borrower in Turkey in
November, 1978, the PPAM agrees with the principal analysis and conclusions in
the PCR.
Section I of the PPAM provides a summary of the experience under
Loans 568-TU and 763-TU.    Section II relates the physical objectives of the
projects to their sectoral context and introduces two additional issues
(monitoring project costs and the international aspects of Loan 568-TU).
Furthermore, to reach a broader understanding of the Bank's role in the
power sector in Turkey, Section II considers more fully the institutional
and financial objectives which were articulated at the time of appraisal
of Loans 568-TU and 763-TU; it links those objectives to the progress which
had already been achieved during the period of project preparation; and it
shows how the Bank pursued them through subsequent loans to the power sector
and through its structural adjustment lending.      Finally, in the light of
Section II, conclusions are drawn in Section III of the PPAM on the extent to
which the original objectives were realistic, the extent to which they were
achieved, and the extent to which their achievement was constrained by
influences extending beyond the scope of a series of conventional project
loans.
Following normal OED procedures, a draft copy of this report was
sent to the Government and TEK for comments.     Those replies which were re-
ceived are reproduced as appendices to the PPAM.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
TURKEY: KEBAN TRANSMISSION PROJECT (LOAN 568-TU) AND
TEK POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT (LOAN 763-TU)
HIGHLIGHTS
Loans 568-TU and 763-TU were the Bank's first two loans to TEK
and its predecessor Etibank and provided foreign exchange to help finance
necessary transmission work in Turkey's main interconnected power system.
Both projects met their physical objectives (PPAM para. 7, PCR para. 6.03)
but with long implementation delays and large cost overruns (PPAM paras. 3-5,
PCR paras. 3.01-3.02 and Attachments 1 and 2).
Recurrent deficiencies in the overall power supply situation com-
bined with an underlying growth in demand which fell short of expectations led
to an increase in energy sales over the project period which was 19% lower
than projected at appraisal (PPAM para. 6, PCR Attachments 4 and 5).    This in
turn, when taken with delays in project implementation and tariFF increases
which did not keep pace with increases in costs, caused the reestimated
incremental financial rate of return (IFRR) on the TEK Power Transmission
project to fall to 3% compared with 13% estimated at appraisal.     No IFRR was
calculated at appraisal for the Keban Transmission project (PPAM para. 7, PCR
para. 6.02). Delays in the implementation of the two transmission projects do
not appear to have contributed to the deficiencies in power supply, which
stemmed mainly from shortages of generating plant caused by delays in TEK's
construction program and by outages (PPAM paras. 3, 6).
The preparation, appraisal and implementation of these two projects
covered a particularly interesting period in the evolution of the power sector
in Turkey and represented the earlier stages of a substantial and continuing
effort by the Bank to participate in institution building and the improvement
of sector policies in pricing and finance.    The results were mixed and in no
small measure influenced adversely by the wider economic, social, political
and legal structure of the country (PPAM para. 39).     Through the projects, a
significant step forward was taken in improving the overall organization of
the power sector (PPAM para. 27).     However, TEK has not achieved reasonable
autonomy in management and staffing (PPAM para. 30) and it has not been able
to pursue pricing policies which would place it on a sound financial footing.
The rate of return on assets and internal cash generation in consequence fell
well short of expectations (PPAM para. 11, PCR paras. 5.01-5.03).       TEK has
also suffered from liquidity problems, due largely to high accounts receivable
with respect to municipalities (PPAM para. 11, PCR para. 5.04).



- viii -
In retrospect, the Bank was over-optimistic at appraisal about the
achievements which were feasible under Loans 568-TU and 763-TU and subsequent
experience underlines a lesson which has been learned in other projects.
Institutional change, especially the achievement of reasonable autonomy,
takes time and may have to be pursued in stages, through broader macroeconomic
work as well as through a series of lending operations, as turned out to be
the case in Turkey (PPAM paras. 40-42).
Other points of particular interest are;
- substitution of a cash generation covenant for a rate of return
covenant in a follow-on project (PPAM para. 25);
- causes of management and staffing problems and efforts to deal
with them (PPAM paras. 30-31, PCR paras. 3.01, 7.01-7.02 and
Attachments 1 and 2);
- difficulty in monitoring actual project costs points to a need to
confirm at appraisal that an adequate system exists to record and
report project-related financial transactions (PPAM paras.
32-33, PCR para. 6.04);
-  attempts to reach international agreement on the use of Euphrates
waters in the context of the Keban hydroelectric project were
unsuccessful (PPAM para. 34),
- Bank supervision of the two projects was satisfactory; the
intractable institutional and financial problems related to TEK
required considerable additional supervision effort through
subsequent lending operations (PPAM paras. 12 and 35, PCR para.
3.04); and
- TEK completed the Keban Transmission project by Force Account,
which provided valuable experience to the organization, for
example in implementing the follow-on project (PCR para. 3.01 and
Attachment 1).



PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT MEMORANDUM
TURKEY: KEBAN TRANSMISSION PROJECT (LOAN 568-TU) AND
TEK POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT (LOAN 763-TU)
I. PROJECT SUMMARY
1.          Bank involvement in the power sector in Turkey dates back nearly
30 years; over this period, there have been ten loans, three credits and
a technical assistance grant (see Appendix 1).      Initially, Bank operations
focussed on projects in the area served by the Cukurova Electric Company
(CEAS) and two of these projects, supported by Loans 623-TU and 775-TU, have
already been the subject of performance audits!/.       Since the formation of
a syndicate of lenders in 1965 to finance the Keban dam, under the chairman-
ship of the Bank, the Bank increasingly turned its attention to the country s
main interconnected power system, operated by Etibank and (from 1970) by its
successor, TEK.   Loans 568-TU and 763-TU were the first two of a series of
loans reflecting this change in lending strategy.
2.          For Loan 568-TU, made in 1968, Etibank was the beneficiary.     The
project consisted of 1460 km of extra-high voltage (EHV) transmission lines
linking Ankara and Istanbul with the Keban hydroelectric plant, then under
construction. The first four units of Keban, with a combined capacity of 620
MW, were expected to be in operation late in 1971 or early in 1972. The main
parts of the Keban Transmission project were scheduled to be completed in time
for the commissioning of the first unit with overall completion of the project
planned for June 1972.    Loan 763-TU was made to TEK in 1971 and helped to
carry the development of the national grid a stage further by financing a time
slice of TEK's 1971-74 transmission construction program. The principal works
were about 4,000 km of 154 kV and 30 kV lines, 1,500 MVA of substations and
other equipment. Planned completion of the TEK Power Transmission project was
in September 1974.
3.           While the Keban Transmission project experienced implementation
delays, the essential components were completed by September 1974, in time for
the commissioning of the Keban hydroelectric plant, which was also delayed.
Final completion of the overall transmission project took place in October,
1976, more than four years behind schedule.        Initially,  the transmission
project was delayed by difficulties with a contractor, who encountered finan-
cial problems and had to abandon the work, after which TEK completed the
project by force account (PCR, para. 3.01 and Attachment 1). Also, according
to TEK (PCR, Attachment 1), project implementation ws deliberately slowed down
in earlier stages to avoid unnecessary investments in view of the delay in
1/ Project Performance Audit Report on the Third and Fourth Cukurova
Power Projects (Report No. 1372 of November 30, 1976).

completion of the Keban power station. Subsequently, TEK suffered management
problems and a shortage of skilled staff, which caused further delays (PCR
Attachment 1).   The project has fulfilled its main purpose of transmitting
energy from Keban to the principal load centers in Ankara and Istanbul but
technical problems have been experienced, notably ice loading between Ankara
and Istanbul and unexplained oscillations in the power system.       Following
design changes and further work and study by TEK, its consultants and the
manufacturers, these problems have been resolved or substantially reduced (PCR
paras. 3.01, 3.03 and Attachment 1).
4.        The TEK Power Transmission    project was also delayed, by nearly
three years, actual completion taking place in June 1977.      This delay was
partly caused by the same management and staffing difficulties which afflicted
the Keban Transmission project.     As envisaged at appraisal, there were a
number of minor revisions in scope during the course of implementation,
in order to adjust the individual project elements to the actual pattern
of system growth (PCR para. 3.02 and Attachment 2).
5.        Both projects experienced cost overruns of about 100%, although no
accurate determination of the final total cost is possible and the PCR is
unable to provide any breakdown of the total into main components (PPAM para.
32).   The principal factors underlying the cost overruns are: the delays in
implementation; local and international inflation; currency realignments; and
TEK's management and staffing difficulties (PCR Attachments 1 and 2).
6.        Total energy sales over the period 1970-77 were 19% lower than
projected, partly because the underlying growth in demand fell short of
expectations, due to a general slowdown in industrial and economic activity
and the failure of certain specific large industrial loads to materialize as
planned; superimposed on this were recurrent shortages of generating plant,
caused by construction delays and outages (PCR Attachments 4 and 5).     As a
result, the level of energy sales forecast for 1974 (the original planned
completion date) was not reached until 1977; consequently, the delay in
implementing the TEK Power Transmission project does not appear to have
affected the overall power supply situation!L.
7.        At the time of appraisal, the projects were justified as integral
and essential parts of TEK's long-term transmission system development;
although energy sales grew more slowly than projected at appraisal, in retro-
spect the need for the projects has been confirmed (PCR Attachments 1 and 2).
However, since it is not possible to justify transmission projects of this
kind in isolation from other investments in the power system, the benefits
of the projects are not separately quantifiable.    For this reason, no incre-
mental financial rate of return (IFRR) was calculated at appraisal for the
1/   This view seems to be supported by TEK. See PCR, Attachment 1.



-3-
Keban Transmission project. As part of the appraisal for the TEK Power
Transmission project, an IFRR was calculated on the whole 1971-74 time slice
of TEK's investment program, including generation as well as transmission,
yielding an IFRR of about 13%.    The IFRR recalculated on a similar basis for
the actual implementation period is about 3%. This reduction in the estimated
IFRR is due to the delay in project implementation, growth in energy sales
slower than projected and tariff increases which did not keep pace with
increases in capital and operating costs (PCR para. 6.02).
8.        Aside from the projects' essential physical works, Loans 568-TU
and 763-TU had important institutional and financial objectives, which, if
achieved, would have had far reaching effects on the power sector.        Prin-
cipally, the sector was to be reorganized and consolidated, by integrating
power facilities at the bulk supply level within a national power authority,
that authority was to be given reasonable institutional autonomy and it was
to be placed on a sound financial footing. As a parallel effort, supporting
the same objectives, the Bank made a technical assistance grant in 1965 (PPAM
paras. 16-17).
9.        Reasonable progress towards these institutional and financial
goals had already been made by the time the Keban Transmission project was
appraised, with the administrative consolidation of power activities within
Etibank, the drafting of a law to create TEK, and the appointment of consul-
tants to undertake the first stage of the technical assistance grant.         A
requirement for Etibank to earn an 8% rate of return on revalued assets was
included in the loan documents for Loan 568-TU (PPAM paras. 16-18). When the
TEK Power Transmission project was appraised, the TEK law had been passed.
While it differed in several respects from the Bank's original expectations,
it included the requirement for TEK to earn an 8% rate of return on revalued
assets and it represented a significant step forward in improving the overall
organization of the sector by bringing together, within a national power
authority, the responsibility for generation and transmission, with only minor
exceptions. These achievements should not be underestimated, although coordi-
nation with the State Hydraulic Works (Devlet Su Iseri or DSI) needs to be
improved and distribution remains in the hands of municipalities (PPAM paras.
16-21, 27).
10.       Notwithstanding these achievements, reasonable autonomy for TEK has
not been achieved and TEK has not been placed on a sound financial footing,
although several important improvements have been made in specific areas
related to management,   planning and finance (PPAM paras 37-38).       To some
extent, the limitations on TEK's autonomy were known or anticipated when
Loans 568-TU and 763-TU were approved and indeed were acknowledged as being
among the more important ways in which the TEK law differed from the Bank's
original expectations.    For example, the appraisal report for Loan 763-TU
recognized that, as a State Economic Enterprise (SEE), TEK was subject to
controls in the area of pricing and staffing.    Nevertheless, even granted the
fact that TEK was a new entity, the appraisal report must be judged in retro-
spect as overoptimistic in its expectations.



-4-
11.       The institutional performance of TEK has suffered through a lack
of continuity in top management and of experienced middle-level administra-
tive and technical personnel.      Financial performance, as measured by the
rate of return on revalued assets and by internal cash generation, has suf-
fered as a result and also because of inadequate tariffs, delayed commission-
ing of projects and slower-than-expected sales growth.     Only in 1972 did TEK
come close to meeting its rate of return requirement while internal cash
generation was well below the levels estimated at appraisal, so that TEK
has been unable to support a reasonable proportion of its own investment
program. A further problem has been liquidity, due largely to TEK's inability
to collect revenues from municipalities for electricity sold to them (PCR
para. 5.04).   The problem of accounts receivable was recognized at appraisal
in both projects but no specific measures were proposed. Subsequently, direct
efforts to reduce municipal overdues have been made in the context of follow-
on projects and the government has taken steps as result of these eforts but
the problem persists.
12.       Bank supervision of Loans 568-TU and 763-TU was satisfactory.
Supervision missions visited Turkey on average about every 10 months for Loan
568-TU and about once a year in the case of Loan 763-TU.     In addition, there
were frequent country visits related to the preparation, appraisal and super-
vision of follow-on projects (PPAM para. 35 and PCR, para. 3.04).
II. SUPPLEMENTARY COMMENTS AND MAIN ISSUES
The Projects and the Sector Development Program
13.        In 1968, Turkey was implementing a long-term development program
of generation and transmission for the power sector. Investment expenditures
related to this program for the period 1968-72 were identified in the Govern-
ment's second Five-Year Plan and amounted to nearly US$1 billion, of which
Etibank and DSI accounted for 38% and 43% respectively, while the balance
(19%) consisted of extensions to the CEAS system, municipal systems and rural
electrification.   A major element in the DSI program was completion of the
Keban hydroelectric station, on which the main civil works had started in
1966, following the formation of a Syndicate of lenders under the chairmanship
of the World Bank (PCR para. 1.05).       Other members of the Syndicate were
France, Germany, Italy, U.S.A. and the European Investment Bank. An important
part of Etibank's program was the construction of a national interconnected
transmission system, comprising a 380-kV      EHV grid to supplement a 154-kV
system then in existence. The Keban Transmission project, with a total esti-
mated cost of US$35.9 million, was part of the first stage of this EHV system
development, consisting of transmission lines and related substations to
connect the Keban hydroelectric station with the principal load centers in
Ankara and Istanbul. Thus, Loan 568-TU accounted for about 10% of Etibank's
total capital development program for the period 1968-72 and represented
IBRD's contribution to the Keban project; other members of the Syndicate



-5-
,financed the dam, power house and related facilities.   It was expected, when
Loan 568-TU was appraised in January 1968, that the first four units of the
Keban station, with a combined installed capacity of 620MW, would be in
operation late in 1971 or early in 1972.
14.         Loan 763-TU financed a project to carry the development of the
national grid a stage further, by the construction of various links and
additions which would unite or strengthen existing installations. At the time
of appraisal, in September 1970, planned investment for the power sector
during the period 1971-77 was approaching US$1.5 billion.     TEK, having suc-
ceeded Etibank, was scheduled to implement works amounting to one-half the
program, while DSI would undertake some 43%; distribution works by municipal-
ities and generation and transmission facilities to be constructed by CEAS
were the remaining works in the sector program, accounting for 7% of the
total. TEK's 1971-77 investment program included the second stage development
of the EHV system, additions to the 154-kV system and work on lower voltage
lines.   On completion of the 1971-77 program, all major distribution systems
and generating stations in the country would be interconnected.        The TEK
Transmission project, with a total estimated cost of US$65.1 million, was a
time-slice of this program, covering the transmission construction envisaged
in the period 1971-74 and accounting for nearly 10% of TEK's total 1971-77
investment requirements.
Institutional and Financial Objectives
15.       From an institutional point of view, the Turkish power sector
at the time of appraisal of the Keban Transmis/sion project was fragmented
and complex. Four state organizations (EIEiL/, Etibank, Iller Bank and
DSI), a half-dozen or so private companies (the largest of which was CEAS),
a large number of private industrial firms and more than 600 municipalities
and villages were involved with generating, transmitting and distributing
electricity in Turkey.   EIEI was a planning and statistical organization for
the whole of the electrical supply industry; Etibank put into effect the plans
for development initiated by EIEI; Iller Bank assisted municipalities and
villages with the finance and construction of their electricity systems; and
DSI developed and operated multipurpose hydroelectric projects in cooperation
with EIEI.
16.       A key objective of the Bank and other members of the Keban syndi-
cate was to help the government reorganize and consolidate the electric
power sector and place it on a sound financial footing.    To this end, legis-
lation was drafted with the assistance of the Bank and placed before Parlia-
ment in December 1966 to create TEK as the sole generating and transmitting
agency of the government, with control of its own planning and development and
powers to take over municipal systems if requested by the municipalities. At

- 6 -
the time of appraisal of Loan 568-TU, it was expected that the legislation
would be passed later in 1968 or early in 1969. Meanwhile, as a first step,
an interim reorganization became effective on January 1, 1968, under which all
of Etibank's power activities were consolidated by administrative action into
the Etibank Power Group.     Although not a separate legal entity, the Power
Group was a distinct enterprise with its own budgeting and accounting arrange-
ments; it assumed responsibility for operating the DSI hydroelectric stations
and had transferred to it from EIEI responsibility for most electric planning
activities. DSI was to secure Etibank's agreement before beginning the
construction of new hydroelectric installations within Etibank's service
areas.   Similarly, no municipality connected to Etibank's system or which
could be supplied more economically by Etibank would be permitted to build or
extend its own generating plant in future.
17.       A further measure to help reorganize the electric power sector was
the 1965 technical assistance grant of US$1.95 million, which covered the
foreign exchange costs of consultants to assist the government in making
the transition to TEK.     Specifically, the following objectives were to be
achieved: centralized dispatching of power; centralized planning and coordina-
tion of construction programs; and management of the industry in accordance
with commercial and industrial practices, including appropriate accounting
systems.
18.       The goal of placing the power sector on a sound financial footing
led to agreement on an acceptable financial rate of return on the realistic
net value of the fixed power assets in service, whether owned or merely
operated by the Power Group. Tariffs were to be set so as to achieve a
minimum rate of return of 8% after taxes on a realistically valued asset base,
commencing with 1970, any shortfall in one year being made up in the following
year.   However, because of the relatively large amount of new power assets
coming into service with Keban in 1971 and 1972, it was also agreed that
a 7% rate of return would be acceptable for the year in which Keban came
into service and for the next two years. Acknowledging the uncertainty
about when asset revaluation could take place, the Bank and Etibank agreed
during negotiations on an 'ad hoc' basis for adjusting the book value of
assets and Etibank was given the option to have revaluation based on the
outcome of a consultant's study.
19.       In the event, the TEK law was passed in July 1970 and became effec-
tive as Law No. 1312 in October of the same year, when TEK took over the
Power Group of Etibank and commenced operations. The work of the consultants
hired under the technical assistance grant by this time was well under way;
the first phase had been completed and reports issued, covering a new system
of accounts, budgeting and reporting, and purchasing and stores procedures.
Consultants had also been hired for the second phase, which involved helping
TEK to implement the proposals which had been made in the first phase and
recommending a scheme for the revaluation of assets.



- 7 -
20.       TEK, like Etibank, was established as a SEE and therefore subject
to Law 440, passed in 1964.    SEEs are supposed to be run on commercial lines
and are subject to taxation like private joint stock companies but in practice
they have been closely supervised by government and their autonomy has been
limited with regard to framing personnel policies and structuring salary
scales and the government has played an active role in determining the prices
of their goods and services.    Originally, when the Bank assisted the govern-
ment in drafting the TEK Legislation, it had envisaged that TEK would be
granted autonomy in its personnel policies, with freedom to hire and fire
personnel of all ranks and to set salary and wage levels which would ensure
the appointment and retention of competent personnel. In addition, TEK was to
determine its own tariffs, subject to government approval only according to
rules which would be clearly defined in the TEK law. These principles were
spelled out in Minutes of Agreement between the Bank and the government early
in 1966. As finally approved, the TEK law required TEK's personnel policies to
conform to the general personnel policy prescribed by government for all SEEs.
Furthermore, a Decree of 1967 removed the freedom of certain SEEs, including
the electricity industry, to determine prices and made them subject to
approval by the Council of Ministers.
21.       These limitations on TEK in the areas of staffing and tariffs due
to its status as a SEE were known or anticipated at the time of appraisal of
Loan 568-TU.   They were again acknowledged in the appraisal report for Loan
763-TU but it was concluded that TEK did enjoy sufficient autonomy in staffing
to permit efficient utilization of manpower and to attract competent employ-
ees.   With regard to tariffs, TEK's position was to be safeguarded by: (i)
extending the rate of return covenant from Loan 568-TU, with certain modifica-
tions; (ii) providing that the fuel-cost adjustment clause in TEK's supply
contracts, which recovered increases in fuel costs from consumers automatic-
ally, would be retained and enforced; and (iii) making a 60% tariff increase a
condition of loan effectiveness.     The modifications to the rate of return
covenant permitted TEK to make up a shortfall in its rate of return in two
years rather than in the following year but removed the concession allowing a
temporary drop in the rate of return to 7% following the commissioning of
Keban, since it was no longer thought to be necessary.     The appraisal report
further recognized that the 'ad hoc' basis for asset revaluation agreed upon
at the time of Loan 568-TU was inappropriate due to the 1970 currency devalua-
tion and the omission of DSI assets taken over by TEK.       For the purpose of
Loan 763-TU, the Bank agreed with TEK and the government on an updated method
of asset revaluation, to be effective by December 31, 1972 and subsequently
modified in the light of the recommendations of the consultants hired for the
second phase of the technical assistance grant; these recommendations were
expected in 1972 and were to be used for computing the rate of return from
1973 onwards. It should be noticed that the 8% rate of return requirement in
Loan 568-TU had also been made part of the TEK law; since the method of
computing the return was not specified in the law, it was clarified in the
loan agreement for Loan 763-TU.

Financial Results
(i) Revaluation of assets.
22.       TEK did not adjust its books by December 31, 1972 to reflect agreed
asset values.    Furthermore, although the recommendations of the consultants
appointed for the second phase of the technical assistance grant were issued
in April 1972, those recommendations were not acted upon to revalue assets
from 1973 onwards.     Actual revision of TEK's books, therefore, to reflect
asset values in accordance with the consultants' recommendations as of Decem-
ber 31, 1973, was made a condition of effectiveness of the subsequent loan to
TEK for the Elbistan Lignite Mine and Power project (Loan 1023-TU). Although
the revaluation action was late by more than two years, TEK did revalue
its assets for 1973 and 1974 by the middle of 1975, according to principles
accepted by the Bank, and this did not delay the effectiveness of Loan 1023
which hinged on the rate of return question.
(ii) Rate of return and tariffs.
23.       A tariff increase took place in July 1971 (although it was 50%
rather than 60%), as a result of which TEK came close to earning its 8% rate
of return in 1972 for the first and last time (PCR para. 5.01).       No further
tariff action took place, aside from the application of the fuel-cost adjust-
ment clause, until June 1976. In the meantime, the Bank appraised two further
projects - the Elbistan project in late 1973 and the Second TEK Power Trans-
mission project (Loan 1194-TU) in late 1974.      Details of the events relating
to the tariff question, from 1974 until the end of 1979, have been described
in the case study for the Elbistan project contained in OED's Supervision
Study and in the PCR (para. 5.01) so that only an outline of the events is
given here.
24.       Board approval for the Elbistan project took place in June 1974 but
as a condition of effectiveness it was agreed that TEK would take specific
steps to increase tariffs to yield an estimated rate of return of 5.4% for
1975 and further tariff increases would be implemented to produce a rate of
return of 8% for 1976 and thereafter.      Board presentation of the Second TEK
Power Transmission project was delayed pending the agreed action.      In view of
the macroeconomic situation, the tariff increases did not materialise but a
compromise was reached in the fall of 1975 whereby TEK would be permitted to
earn a 6% rate of return in 1976 and 8% thereafter. With this understanding,
the Second TEK Power Transmission project was presented to the Board and
approved in November 1975.    Continuing difficulties with inflation and other
internal problems in fact delayed action on tariffs until June 1976, at which
time Loan 1023-TU became effective and Loan 1194-TU was signed.       The effec-
tiveness of Loan 1194-TU was, however, postponed pending further action to
permit TEK to earn an 8% return commencing in 1977.        Tariff increases were
effected in 1977 but TEK-s rate of return continued to fall short of the
covenanted 8%.   After intense discussions, the Bank agreed in April 1978 to
waive the rate of return covenant on the understanding that tariffs would be
increased gradually to yield an 8% return by 1982.      Based on this agreement,
Loan 1194-TU became effective in April 1978.



-9-
25.       Since 1978, the government has requested (in 1979) the substitution
of a cash generation covenant for the rate of return covenant and in con-
junction with the Karakaya Hydropower project (Loan 1844-TU a proved in May
1980), the Bank acceded to the request with effect from 1981 2U.       A further
major development was the new economic policy package announced by the govern-
ment in January 1980, shortly before the Bank's first structural adjustment
loan (approved in March 1980).      According to the announcement, most price
controls on SEEs were abolished and the SEEs are now required to cover operat-
ing costs and generate sufficient funds towards their own investment needs.
An exception was made for electricity tariffs charged for aluminum and ferro-
chrome production but the government is to reimburse TEK for any losses which
it may incur as a result.     Immediately after the announcement, in February
1980, electricity tariffs were increased nearly 130% above April 1979 levels.
(iii) Fuel-cost adjustment clause.
26.       Given the government's reluctance to approve general increases in
TEK's tariffs, the fuel-cost adjustment clause proved to be an important
vehicle for TEK to offset at least some of its cost increases, especially
after the 1973 international oil price increases (PCR para. 4.02). Automatic
application of the clause was repeated as a covenant in Loan 1023-TU.       Con-
trary to these agreements, the clause was eliminated from TEK's tariffs at
the time of the increase in June 1976.      The clause was reinstated in 1977,
following representations from the Bank, but technically it is no longer
automatic and needs the approval of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Re-
sources for its application.     This is a departure from the principles of
Loan 763-TU even though in practice the Ministry has apparently confined its
attention to verifying the details of TEK's calculations and has given its
approval, at least until 1980.
Institutional Development
27.       At the sectoral level, the efforts to bring about greater coordina-
tion and consolidation of power activities, which were initiated during the
preparation of the Keban project and which gained momentum thereafter, have
met with a considerable measure of success. A first step was the administra-
tive consolidation of power activities within Etibank (PPAM para. 16).      Fol-
lowing passage of the TEK law in 1970, in place of four state organizations
responsible for power sector development (PPAM para. 15), there are now two -
TEK and DSI.   EIEI has become a study and research institute, mainly involved
in geological investigations and hydrological studies, although it also acts
as a consulting agency for TEK and DSI. TEK is charged with the responsibil-
ity for the general electrification of Turkey, the construction of thermal
1/   The Bank itself had recognized for some time that the substantive issue
for TEK was one of internal cash generation for the self-financing of
investment rather than formal compliance with the rate of return cove-
nant.   See, for example, the Appraisal Report for the Elbistan project.



- 10 -
power plants, transmission and distribution networks, rural electrification
and the generation and transmission of electricity in bulk.    In this role, it
has taken over operation of the power stations previously operated by Etibank,
DSI, the Municipalities and Iller Bank and is responsible for generation and
transmission in 63 of 67 provinces. While there are two concession companies
in the other four provinces, the most important being CEAS, they are inter-
connected with the TEK network and their operations are fully coordinated.
TEK now owns more than 90% of total installed generating capacity in Turkey,
it accounted for 83% of total generation in 1978 and its interconnected system
covers almost the entire country. However, a large number of municipalities -
more than 100 - still distribute electricity which they buy in bulk from TEK.
DSI continues to plan and build hydroelectric projects but under the TEK
law must do so in cooperation with TEK.    In practice, TEK is still not suffi-
ciently involved in the identification, selection and design stages for
hydroelectric schemes but the problem is being pursued through the Karakaya
project, now under implementation.
28.       As far as TEK itself is concerned, the appraisal report for Loan
763-TU pointed out that further organizational modifications were required to
cope with its increased autonomy and new responsibilities and this would be
examined in the third and final phase of the technical assistance grant. With
regard to top management, the appraisal report concluded that it was too soon
to judge the actual extent of TEK's autonomy. However, in line with the 1966
Minutes of Agreement, it was anticipated that TEK's General Manager would be
appointed for five years to ensure stability and continuity in management.
29.       The management consultants for the third phase of the technical
assistance grant were hired in October 1971 and issued their final report in
March 1973.   Albeit with a long delay, this has led to improvements in the
organization of TEK, notably through the greater decentralization of authority
to regional offices.
30.       By the time of the Elbistan appraisal, it was clear that manage-
ment stability and continuity were not being achieved.       The appointment of
TEK's General Manager is a government prerogative and there were three changes
in General Manager in the first four years of TEK's existence.     Furthermore,
after enactment of a common Personnel Law for SEEs in January 1971, the
general staffing situation deteriorated as salaries became even less attrac-
tive and acute personnel shortages became evident.       By July 1973, 48% of
authorized technical positions were vacant and there was an overall shortage
of 47%.   Also, the turnover of experienced middle-level administrative and
technical staff was high as they looked for better opportunities elsewhere.
In the context of the Elbistan project, the Bank attempted to ameliorate the
problem by having the government agree to the hiring of certain staff on
special contract and the appointment of a General Manager for a minimum
three-year term. Additionally, the government took some steps to improve the
general salary conditions of SEEs in 1975.     Nevertheless, staffing problems
remain critical.



- 11 -
31.       During negotiatiors for the Second TEK Power Transmission project -
by which time the shortage of technical staff had risen to 59% and the overall
shortage to 49% - TEK agreed to carry out a detailed manpower study for the
period 1977-81 and the Bank reiterated its view that the General Manager of
TEK should normally be appointed for a minimum three-year term. Some success
was evident in bringing greater continuity to the post of General Manager
after 1974, although a major change in TEK's top management, including the
General Manager, again took place in the second half of 1978.       The manpower
study has now been finished and concludes that TEK's manpower problems can
only be resolved by a basic SEE reform, e.g., to free the SEEs from the
Personnel Law.    The new economic policy package of January 1980 (PPAM para.
25) does envisage some substantial changes in the government s approach to the
SEEs and subsequent action taken by government in the areas of management
and staffing show that a basic reform of the SEEs is now receiving attention.
The Bank continues to pursue the matter under the Second TEK Power Transmis-
sion project.
Monitoring Project Costs
32.       Although the loan documents for Loans 568-TU and 763-TU contain
the standard requirement that adequate records should be maintained to record
the progress and cost of the projects, the PCR is unable to give any breakdown
of the actual cost of the two projects or even, in the case of Loan 763-TU, a
reasonably accurate estimate of the total.       The Bank urged TEK on several
occasions to supply data on actual project costs but TEK was unable to do so.
The PCR (para. 6.04) gives two principal reasons for this situation: frequent
changes in the composition of the project items and difficulty in separating
project costs from other ongoing capital works in the development program.
Changes in the content of projects of this kind during the course of implemen-
tation are not unusual and in the case of Loan 763-TU the appraisal report
made it clear that individul components were likely to alter.        If the bor-
rower s accounting system is not designed to distinguish the cost of indivi-
dual project items from non-project items, as seems to have been the case, the
problem of estimating actual project costs upon project completion is further
compounded.   No doubt the acute staffing shortages suffered by TEK aggravated
the accounting difficulties.
33.       The problem of estimating final project costs was not unique to the
two loans under review - it was noticed in seven public utilities projects
audited in CY19801/ - but the extent of the problem was more serious than
encountered with other projects in the past.       In future, greater attention
should be given at an early stage in the project - preferably at appraisal but
certainly no later than the first supervision mission - to ensuring that

First Telecommunications Project (Loan 792-GU), Report No. 2908 of March
21, 1980.



- 12 -
progressive expenditures on project works will be recorded. In fact, with
effect from FY1982. Bank staff are required in all projects to confirm, at the
time of appraisal, that an adequate accounting and internal control system
exists for the recording and reporting of project-related financial transac-
tions or will exist by the time that project expenditures commence.
International Aspects
34.       The Bank did not contribute to the financing of the Keban hydro-
electric station itself (PPAM para. 13); nevertheless, given the fact that the
Keban hydroelectric project would create a large reservoir on the Euphrates
River in Turkey, the President's Report for the Keban transmission project
recognized that operation of the Keban dam and reservoir would affect down-
stream users of Euphrates waters in Iraq and Syria (see map). Discussions
between the three riparian countries on the sharing of the Euphrates waters
had taken place since 1962. At the request of the Keban Syndicate, the Bank in
1965 undertook a study of international water problems on the Euphrates River,
the aim of which was to reach an independent and objective determination of
acceptable river flows during reservoir filling, to identify long-term prob-
lems and to suggest means of solving them. The study recommended a regime of
minimum monthly releases during filling and proposed the establishment of an
international tripartite commission for the Euphrates River. Such a commis-
sion was not established; neither was any international agreement reached on
the use of the Euphrates waters, despite the Syndicate's efforts. However,
the President's Report pointed out that the Turkish government had undertaken
to use its best endeavours to reach future agreement with Iraq and Syria
on water sharing and agreed on a regime of controlled flow in the initial
filling period of the dam, in light of the study, which was intended to meet
the needs of downstream users. The President's Report concluded that any
future agreement on the regulation of water releases was unlikely to affect
the economics of the project, since the purpose of the dam was to conserve
water and the Turkish power system was large enough to be able to absorb all
the power generated by the release of downstream users' water requirements,
irrespective of the time of release. The Bank continued to pursue the matter
of an international agreement thereafter, in the context of the Karakaya and
other projects, to bring about negotiations between the riparians to solve the
issue, without success so far.
Supervision
35.       Bank supervision of the two projects was satisfactory.    From a
technical point of view, neither project was particularly difficult, although
some of the EHV construction for the Keban Transmission project was new to
Turkey. Bank staff gave what assistance it could in dealing with the tech-
nical problems and in helping to overcome the delays caused by the financial
problems of the Keban transmission line contractor (PCR para. 3.04). The
institutional and financial problems related to TEK were much more intractable
and considerable additional effort was devoted by Bank staff to tackling these
problems through subsequent lending operations connected with the Elbistan and



- 13 -
Second TEK Power Transmission projects. In the matter of the Bank's reporting
requirements, TEK has expressed the view that they were unduly onerous rela-
tive to the needs of the project and the competing demands on TEK's staff.
TEK has also commented on ways of improving the Bank's disbursement procedures
(PCR Attachments 1 and 2).
III.     CONCLUSIONS
Physical Objectives
36.       Physical achievements under Loans 568-TU and 763-TU were generally
satisfactory.   While the projects were completed with large time and cost
overruns, initial technical problems were encountered and some minor ones
persist, both projects were an integral part of TEK's system development and
have carried out essential tasks as envisaged.     However, the loans also had
major institutional and financial objectives; here, the achievements were at
best mixed and in certain important ways disappointing.
Institutional Objectives
37.       At the sectoral level, much was achieved in terms of coordination
and consolidation.   In bulk power supply, TEK was created and is established
as the national authority solely responsible for generation and transmission,
with only minor exceptions, although further coordination between TEK and DSI
is desirable. Considerable fragmentation still exists at the retail level but
the integration of municipal and other local systems was not a goal 'of these
two projects; however, it was not precluded by the institutional changes which
occurred and it is in fact currently under considerationlY.         Within TEK,
there have been institutional achievements, for example some training of key
accounting and technical staff (PCR para. 7.01 and Attachment 1), a greater
decentralization of authority to regional offices and improvements in system
planning and procurement. Nevertheless, the fundamental aim of building
a reasonably autonomous institution has not been achieved, as seen most
noticeably through frequent management changes and the lack of freedom in
personnel and tariff policies.
Financial Objectives
38.       Perhaps most disappointing of all was the very limited progress
made towards the achievement of financial objectives.        As the PCR points
out (para. 7.01), a number of specific improvements were made, albeit with
some delays and due in part to the technical assistance grant: principles and
1/   See the President's Report for the Second Structural Adjustment Loan
(Report No. P-3034-TU of April 20, 1981).



- 14 -
methods of asset revaluation have been agreed and implemented and an adequate
accounting and reporting system was established.     TEK has furnished audited
accounts to the Bank in a reasonably timely manner although, during the period
of supervision of Loans 568-TU and 763-TU, the Bank was not satisfied with the
way in which the audit was carried out!7. These improvements were important
in their own right but the key objective of placing TEK on a sound financial
footing has not been achieved.   Due largely to TEK's lack of freedom in tariff
policies, TEK came close to meeting the rate of return target only in 1972
and internal cash generation was always inadequate.        Accounts receivable
have consistently posed a serious problem and were a prime cause of poor
liquidity, which at times has led to TEK's inability to pay suppliers. Even
in the application of the fuel-cost adjustment clause, which was of great
assistance to TEK, there has been some retreat from the principle of automa-
ticity.
The Role of the Bank
39.       The case study for the Elbistan project contained in OED's Supervi-
sion Study concluded that the Bank and the relevant authorities in Turkey did
not substantially disagree over the principles underlying the main objectives
of that project and the authorities recognized the long-term value of the
institutional and other improvements advocated by the Bank.     The fundamental
problems which arose stemmed mainly from a difference in approach towards the
time horizon over which the agreed principles could be implemented and from
the fact that many problems were related to the broader economic, social and
legal structure of Turkey, particularly as it affected the SEE system.
Furthermore, the problems had to be viewed against a background of sensitive
political developments and a period of growing economic difficulties.     These
same conclusions are valid for Loans 568-TU and 763-TU since their key insti-
tutional and financial objectives were no different from those incorporated
in the Elbistan project.
40.       While the impact of exogenous influences - notably world and na-
tional economic and political events - on the achievement of the projects'
objectives could not reasonably have been foreseen, the Bank was to an extent
at least aware of the structural problems at the time of appraisal of Loans
568-TU and 763-TU. In particular, the appraisal reports pointed to the
restrictions imposed upon TEK in the areas of tariffs and personnel policies
due to its status as a SEE (PPAM para. 21). However, in retrospect it can be
concluded that the Bank was over-optimistic about the achievements which were
1/   Standard covenants requiring the submission of audited accounts in a
manner satisfactory to the Bank were included in Loans 568-TU and 763-TU.
A discussion of Bank experience with TEK's audit procedures can be found
in OED's Supervision Study.    According to the appraisal report for the
Karakaya project, the audit provisions for TEK's accounts are now satis-
factory to the Bank.



- 15 -
possible in the context of conventional project loans, partly no doubt because
TEK was a new organization even at the time when the second of the two loans
was approved.
41.       In the event, the magnitude of the problems and the structural
resistance to change proved to be too great; ultimately the Bank accepted that
there were clear limits to the persuasion which it could exercise, despite the
considerable influence which might be expected to flow from its involvement in
the Elbistan and the Second TEK Power Transmission projects.     The effective-
ness of the Elbistan loan and the presentation, signing and effectiveness of
the Second TEK Power Transmission loan were all delayed with at best limited
results (PPAM para. 24).   Hence, by remaining active in the power sector, it
was necessary for the Bank to respond flexibly to the sector's problems, to
address the broader structural problems in so far as it could and to look for
institutional improvements over a longer time horizon: the role of the Bank
should be judged in this light.
42.      With regard to the broader approach, the Bank has maintained a
close dialogue with the relevant authorities on macroeconomic questions -
and specifically on the problem of strengthening the SEEs - through its
country economic work and the program and structural adjustment loans. Within
the power sector, the Bank has adapted its general audit requirements to the
specific circumstances of TEK, 'ad hoc' arrangements were made to tackle
staffing problems (although with little success) and the Bank's approach to
the rate of return and tariff questions has been successively modified,
resulting finally in the shift from a rate of return covenant to one based
upon internal cash generation.    The new economic policy package announced in
January 1980 and measures introduced subsequently, which focussed among other
things upon the reform of the SEEs, may represent the essential first steps
towards the major structural and institutional changes required in the longer
term.

TURKEY
LOANS 568-TU AND 763-TU COMPLETION REPORT
KEBAN AND TEK POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECTS
1.   Introduction
1.01      Attached are completion reports for these two projects, prepared by
the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK), dated January 28, 1978, designated
Attachments 1 and 2 respectively, and a cost estimate for the Keban Transmission
Project at Attachment 3. Since both projects formed part of TEK's investment
program for the period, a combined Project Completion Report is appropriate.
Although TEK's reports are dated January 1977, further information required for
the analysis was obtained only a year later. The following information supple-
ments that contained in these reports.
Project Description
1.02      The Keban Transmission Project (Loan 568-TU) consisted of approximately
1460 km of extra-high-voltage (380 kV) transmission lines linking Istanbul and
Ankara with the 620-MW Keban Hydroelectric Project which was being constructed
at the same time. The TEK Transmission Project consisted essentially of TEK's
transmission construction program for 1971-1974, comprising about 4,000 km of
154 and 30-kV lines and 1,500 MVA of substations and other equipment. Although
planned for completion in 1970 and 1974 respectively, the Projects were completed
only in 1976 and 1977.
Prolect Objectives
1.03      Aside from the critical need for the physical facilities included in
the Projects, a principal objective was to improve organization and financial
responsibility in the government-controlled part of the sector. To this end,
with the active assistance of the Bank and its special adviser, Lord Hinton
of Bankside, the Turkiye Elektrik Kurumu (Turkish Electricity Authority - TEK)
was established on October 25, 1970, under Law No. 1312 of July 1970 from the
power group of ETIBANK, the original beneficiary under Loan 568-TU. This was the
first step to integrate a very large number of independent power facilities into
a coherent central electricity authority. The law drafted with the help of the
Bank and Lord Hinton, incorporated agreements reached with the Government on the
scope and functions of the national electricity authority and the areas within
which the authority would have autonomy. The draft reflected the stated intention
of Law 440 that State Economic Enterprises (SEE) (of which TEK is one) be run
autonomously in accordance with commercial principles and as though they were



- 20 -
private stock companies. The TEK lawas passed, fell short of this principally
in the degree of autonomy accorded to the new organization and especially in
the lack of freedom to set salaries and terms of service of non-unionized staff.
Another change which has materially affected TEK's central role in power planning
and operations is that, contrary to the agreement reached with the Government,
the planning, design and construction of hydroelectric projects continued to be
the responsibility of DSI, the Turkish Water Development Authority. The appoint-
ment of TEK's general manager and his assistants is also the prerogative of the
Government, rather than a function of TEK's board.
1.04      Whilst the establishment of TEK brought generation and transmission
facilities under one authority, distribution to the ultimate customers continues
to remain in the hands of municipalities. Exceptions to this general statement
exist. They are two relatively minor concession areas, large industrial and
other consumers outside municipal areas of jurisdiction, and some autoproducers.
1.05      Prior to Loan 568-TU the Bank had made one loan (1952) for the Seyhan
Dam in the Cukurova concession area, one credit (1963) to cover the foreign
exchange cost of a third generator in the Seyhan power station and a credit
(1964) for the Mersin thermal power station also in the Cukurova concession
area. In 1965 the Bank, which led the financing consortium (EIB, KfW, USAID,
France and Italy) for tlhe main Keban hydropower project, participated by
contributing to *the finance of the associated transmission lines, on condition
that the Government took steps to improve the efficiency of the power industry.
A start on the implementation of the needed reorganization which had been
identified by ETIBANK's expatriate consultants was made possible by the
application of a portion of a 1965 Bank technical assistance grant of up
to US$1.95 million to cover the foreign exchange costs.
2.   Project Preparation and Appraisal
2.01      The Keban transmission lines financed under Loan 568-TU were designed
and supervised during construction by expatriate consultants 'A' who were
themselves financed by USAID through their association with the Gokcekaya line
forming part of the systeL connecting Keban and the Gokcekaya hydro plant with
Istanbul. The works financed under Loan 763-TU were designed by TEK's own staff
assisted by expatriate consultant 'B" for network studies.
2.02      The Power Group of ETIBANK, the forerunner of TEK, was considered,at
the time of appraisal of the Keban Transmission Line Project,to be competently
managed and staffed. By 1970 TEK had recognized the need for reorganization
and approached Electricite de France (EdF) for assistance, and by the time
Loan 763-TU was being considered, the appraisal report noted that Government
was considering revisions to the personnel law which might hamper classification
and retention of professional staff. Employment conditions as since imposed by
the personnel law, have led to the steady flight of competent ataff to the private
sector and this has been ar major factor in the generally poor performance of
the Borrower and the consequent delays in the two projects being evaluated here.



- 21 -
2.03      Contrary to the intentions of Law 440, as described above,
the public power industry has been traditionally tightly controlled particularly
as to the charge it could levy for energy; thus, bulk electricity is sold at a
price insufficient to generate adequate resources for investment. Loans 568-TU
and 763-TU sought to achieve the objective of internally generating a reasonable
portion of the capital expansion requirements by obtaining acceptance of a
minimum 8% rate of return based on realistically valued average net fixed assets
in service (a provision repeated in principle in the TEK law though without a
specific requirement for periodic revaluation). Government's unwillingness for
political reasons to increase power rates in step with high inflation and
development needs is reflected in the repeated failure to reach the agreed
financial targets.
2.04      Periodic revaluation being necessary for the realistic adjustment
of tariffs and for appropriate cash generation under inflationary conditions,
the loan documents reflect the agreements reached on asset revaluation based
on consultants' recommendations. Briefly, the loan agreement under Loan 763-TU
required TEK to establish revaluation principles and methods satisfactory to
the Bank based on the recommendations of consultants for computing the return
from 1973 onwards.
3.   Project Implementation
3.01      The Keban transmission lines originally were planned to be completed --
in 1970, in time for the commissioning of the first Keban unit. Completion was
subsequently revised to June 1972. In practice, essential parts of the lines were
completed more than two years late, but still in time for the first unit of Keban
which was itself eventually commissioned in September 1974. Final completion
was not until October 1976. Construction of the lines was initially contracted
with expatriate firm 'C' which ran into financial difficulties due to prolongation
of the construction period and devaluation of the Turkish lira. As a result of
these difficulties, the contractor was forced to abandon the work and TEK comple-
ted the project by force account. Shortage of skilled staff and inexperience
in management of such a large line construction project lay at the root of much
of the subsequent -delay. However, learning the hard way can be a good school
provided the personnel stay with the organization to apply their experience, and
indeed subsequently TEK has successfully managed a major expansion of the 380-kV
system; nonetheless, TEK's completion report specifically complains of the in-
ability to recruit and retain technical staff and cites recent resignation of
trained personnel.
3.02      The TEK Transmission Project was a "time-slice" project comprising
TEK's transmission program for the years 1971 through 1974. Due in part to the
shortage of skilled staff mentioned above, many of the facilities included in
the original project were not completed until 1977 although there were many minor
changes in the scope of the project over the project period (principally line
locations and substation sizes)to accommodate the needs of a dynamic and growing
system. Attachment 4 gives TEK's forecast sales under Loan 763-TU and actuals
for the period 1970-1977 (The forecasts for 1970-1972 were updates of the sales
estimated under Loan 568-TU, taking into account the latest market conditions).



- 22 -
It will be seen that partly as a result of generation shortages (Keban delay),
the sales target forecast in the appraisal report for 1974 was not reached
until 1976. Attachment 5 gives the main reasons for the shortfall in TEK's
sales during the period 1970-1977.
3.03      Although the Keban transmission lines have carried the energy
generated at Keban to the load centers in the West, some disturbing problems
have been encountered. Although there had been ample experience in the
country with steel-tower transmission lines at lower voltages, the Keban
lines introduced several innovations including bundled conductors, tension
stringing, and refined designs incorporating high-strength steel. Such lines
require a high standard of field erection and installation practices and TEK
experienced some initial difficulties in coping with these. In addition, the
standard Turkish loading criteria proved inadequate for the unprecedented ice
loading experienced on the Istanbul-Ankara portion of the line, and subsequent
design changes were required. Also, ever since the generators were commissioned
there has been a debate as to whether some unexplained oscillations in the power
system originate from the alternators and their control, or are a function of the
transmission line characteristics. No positive identification of the cause has
been made although an improvement seems to have been experienced with the bringing
into service of the GCkcekaya/Ankara section of the line in 1976 and TEK, working
with its consultants and the mantffacturers, has resolved the problem.
3.04      The Bank and its associates, particularly the staff of USAID, endeavored
to assist project implementation by repeated representations to the government
authorities to clear bureaucratic delays occasioned by such things as import licence
problems, the supply of steel for transmission line towers and the like. The Bank
also participated in discussions between TEK and the Keban transmission line
contractor in an attempt to resolve the issue involving the transfer of Turkish
lira to the country of the contractor, including direct approaches to the
Government of that country to find ways to resolve the dispute. The Bank agreed
to the completion of the Keban line by TEK force account only when all hope
of success had faded, at which point it assisted in the setting up of construc-
tion schedules, equipment requirements, etc.
Disbursements
3.05      Attachment 6 gives a comparison of the actual disbursements with the
original forecasts for each of the two loans. It will be seen that for both
loans, only 70% had been disbursed by the original Project completion dates
(1971 for Loan 568-TU and 1974 for Loan 763-TU). The actual loan allocations
are compared with the forecast allocations in Attachment 7.
4.     Tariffs
4.01      As a condition of effectiveness of Loan 763-TU, TEK's tariffs were
raised on average 50% effective July 1, 1971 (from about 16 kurus per kWh to
a little over 23 kurus per kWh). This was expected to place TEK's finances on



- 23 -
a satisfactory footing and in fact during 1972, the first year for which the
increased tariffs were effective for a whole year, TEK by and large achieved the
agreed rate of return on 8% on revalued assets (see TEK's Income Statement
in Attachment 8). It was only when TEK was beset by large inflationary cost
increases with consequential effect on the manpower situation and the implementa-
tion of projects and by Government's reluctance to raise tariffs in its effort
to hold down inflation that TEK's financial situation started to deteriorate.
4.02      Under Loan 763-TU, a fuel adjustment clause was introduced in TEK's
tariffs at the Bank's urging whereby increases in fuel costs are automatically
recovered from consumers without a general tariff revision. This proved to be
of significant help to TEK in 1973 and 1974 since the clause helped TEK to pass
on to customers, without Government approval, its soaring fuel costs as a result
of the surge in international oil prices. When the average tariff level was
around 24 kurus per KWh, the fuel adjustment charge rose from 3.5 kurus per
KWh in December 1973 to 15.1 kurus per KWh in January 1974 raising the price
of electricity to the consumer 42% in just about two months. Without the
automatic fuel adjustment clause it is certain that there would have been
major lags in recovering the increased fuei costs from customers, which would
have led to a further serious deterioration in TEK's financial condition.



- 24 -
5.   Financial Aspects
5.01      Loan 763-TU required TEK to earn an 8% return on revalued net fixed
assets and to continue to revalue assets in future as prices change. Any
shortfall in a year is required to be made up within the next two years; an
overrun could be applied to offset any shortfall in one or more of the next
three years (Loan 568-TU had substantially the same provisions). Fulfillment
of this covenant would have meant significant tariff increases from time to
time. However, after a 50% tariff increase in July 1971, there was no effective
action until June 1976 to raise tariffs except for increasing the fuel surcharge
because of the circumstances detailed below, and TEK has not met the rate of
return covenant (8% on revalued net fixed assets) by varying margins from 1970
to date (by 2.5% in 1970, 3.1% in 1971, marginally in 1972, 5.3% in 1973, 5.7% in
1974, 5.4% in 1975 and 3.9% in 1976). The surge in oil prices in 1973-1974 (para 4.02)
made the task of ensuring TEK's financial viability rather difficult. In connec-
tion with Loan 1023-TU,in view of the time required for the economy to adjust
itself to the rapid price escalation, the Bank agreed to a longer-term approach
for TEK to meet the required 8% as follows:
(a) Government would establish not later than March 15, 1975
a new basic tariff yielding TEK a net average revenue of
51 kurus/KWh; and
(b) from 1976 onwards, TEK would earn an 8% return on a
revalued asset base.
These targets were not fully realized. However taking into account Government's
anti-inflationary and economic stabilization policies, agreement was subsequently
reached with Government that TEK would earn an 8% return from 1977 on a revalued
asset base as agreed and that for 1976, such action including tariff adjustments
would be taken by January 1, 1976 as would enable TEK to earn a 6% return in
that year. However in the difficult political conditions then prevailing and
in the absence of a strong Government able to provide political leadership,
tariff action was delayed until May 1976 when rates were raised an average of
about 20% with effect from June 1, 1976. Government approved further marginal
adjustments in TEX's tariffs effective April 1, 1977 in order to enable TEK to
increase its earnings. Again TEK's tariffs were raised about 42% effective
September 10, 1977 but the increased revenues were largely offset by increases
in fuel prices 1/ and in wages and salaries with the result that TEK's rate of
return in 1977was only about 3.4%.   TEK's actual rates of return for.1971-1977
are given in comparison with the forecast returns in Attachment 8.
1/ The revised tariffs of September 10 were based on the increased fuel prices
introduced at that time and the fuel surcharge was made applicable only to subse-
quent fuel price increases.



- 25 -
5.02      The main reasons for TEK's failure to reach the agreed 8% return
have been:
(a) delayed commissioning of projects such as Keban resulting in lower
availability of hydropower for meeting the demand;
(b) less-than-expected load growth due in part to lack of adequate
supply (See Attachment 5);
(c) staffing problems;
(d) rising employment costs, mostly of unionized labor, (wages and
salaries in 1976 were about 230% of the 1970 appraisal estimate);
and
(e) Government's unwillingness to approve tariff increases especially
because of the unsettled political conditions in the country.
5.03      TEK's low rates of return coupled with inflationary increases in
construction expenditures resulted in self-financing levels that were much
lower than those estimated at appraisal. During the period 1971-1977, the
self-financing level ranged from 11% to 37% as against the estimated range
of 40% to 156% (See Attachment 9 for details).
5.04      Another serious financial problem wnich has beset TEK for the past
few years is the problem of liquidity caused mainly by slow collection of
receivables from municipalities despite a 15% discount for payment within
one month and a penalty of 1% per month for payments thereafter (until these
conditions were changed in June 1976). Since 1971, receivables have been
consistently around four months' revenue, which is a very high level. At the
end of April 1977 receivables which were outstanding for more than three
months amounted to LT 3.5 billion, which itself is over five months' revenues.
A significant portion of these outstandings was 2-3 years old. Government's
solution to this problem has been consolidation and payment of intra-public
sector debts. This has proved to be ineffective. After the consolidation of
such debts in May 1975 under a law passed by Parliament, Government has again
assumed responsibility for payment of TEK's bills for supply of electricity
to municipalities after offsetting amounts due by TEK to various governmental
agencies such as TKI, the Turkish Coal Enterprises, TPAO, the Turkish Petroleum
Authority and tax authorities.
6.   Justification of the Projects and Bank's Role
6.01      Over the period that has elapsed since the appraisal for Loan 568-TU,
its completion and that of the works under Loan 763-TU, various factors have
affected TEK. These are principally a) an unwillingness to price electrical
energy at levels adequate to meet development needs, b) the salaries of non-
unionized staff progressively fell 50% to 65% below the level of the private
sector employing similar skills, c) the Government's policy of fuel price
subsidy has kept coal and lignite prices below their economic worth, d) Govern-
ment policy has led to excessive levels of staffing in the lower grades of TEK
in many disciplines which serves to reduce productivity and inflate costs.



- 26 -
6.02       No rate of return was calculated for the Keban Transmission Line
Project since the lines were inseparable from the Keban Project itself.
However, an internal financial rate of return calculation was made for the
1971-74 time-slice of the generation/transmission investment program as part
of the 763-TU appraisal. The forecast rate of return was 13%. This was
derived by using forecast revenues as a measure of benefits and therefore is
not a true economic return, but can be used to assess the adequacy of long-
run tariff policy. A similar calculation using actual investment, operating
cost and revenue data for the period 1971-76 (since the forecast sales target
was reached only in 1976) yields a return of only 3% (Attachment 10). This
result is not surprising in view of the two-year delay in completing the
project and reaching the original sales forecast, and Government policy in
holding down electricity prices. Average revenue per KWh in 1976 was 7% below
forecast levels (in 1971 terms) despite a near-doubling of average fuel and
operating cost (also in 1971 terms) compared with the appraisal estimate. The
result was further depressed since, because of the delay in hydro project con-
struction (principally Keban), TEK was forced to resort to expensive generation
from oil-fueled gas turbines which were rushed into service in an attempt to
meet the shortages.
6.03       The fact remains that both projects financed through these loans were
essential for the power sector's development, and that from a purely technical
standpoint the Projects have clearly fulfilled their purpose. However a major
objective of the Projects lay in the institution-building field and here the
extent to which the goals were achieved is less clear-cut. At the non-political
levels in Turkey, both in government ministries and productive enterprises, there
is a positive acceptance of those institution-building objectives wnich were the
main justification for the lending operations. These were: the establishment of
an autonomous, national power authority, the introduction of financial management
techniques and policies designed to support the autonomous nature of the SEE,
strengthening the sector development planning methods in terms of the nationally
most economic program, and the enhanced cooperation of the authorities concerned,
especially those of TEK and the Water Development Authority (DSI). Considering
the improvements brought about through the medium of Loans 568-TU and 763-TU,
and the deficiencies still existing, the two loans should be considered as having
partially succeeded in their objectives and therefore as moderately successful.
6.04       Despite the relatively unsatisfactory institutional and financial
performance, credit must be given to TEK for coping with growth in generation
and sales of nearly three times in the decade 1968-1978, to a 4,000-MW system--large
by any standards--and an investment program which saw asset values increase
nearly ten times due to the rapid growth in a period of escalating international
prices. As already stated, the TEK Power Transmission Project was a time-slice
development and the cost of the Project was based on an estimate of the likely works
to be constructed in the period. Changes in this plan would have been normal
had the work been carried out during the plan period. As a result of the two-
year delay, compounded by the financial, operational and inflationary problems
experienced, numerous changes in minor and major detail inevitably had to be
made. Since the works originally planned were closely tied to other works and
handled in the books of accounts as indistinguishable parts of the whole, it is



- 27 -
not now possible to determine accurately the final costs of the various components
of the Project. The best judgement is that the final costs are of the order
of double the original estimates.
7.     Overall Achievements
7.01        So far, although the Bank's aims have not been fully achieved, signifi-
cant steps have been taken towards these goals. Mainly through the help of con-
sultants financed by the technical assistance grant of US$1.95 million and partly
also through the impetus provided by the two loans in question, TEK has established
an adequate accounting and reporting system. The establishment of the system
itself is a significant achievement although it is not being used properly for
management purposes. Key accounting staff have also been trained in selected
utilities in the USA. As regards other institutional improvements, for basically
political reasons, institutional autonomy of TEK does not exist. Its technical
operations have suffered because it is unable to hold an adequate level of
experienced and competent staff. Despite a general shortage of competent staff
its system planning has remained satisfactory, but implementation has been adversely
affected by these constraints. What success has been achieved is as a result of the
efforts of a constantly reducing core of dedicated and competent people. The Bank
was instrumental in introducing dynamic system planning methods through the
development of computer programs, and the Turkish system was used to test a
general linear planning model developed in the Bank. The development program,
iOhich indicated the need for rapid introduction of thermal plant to meet the demand
in 1974-78, was not then adopted by Government despite the Bank's urgings and the
severe shortages in these years are now a matter of history. TEK's skills in
drafting bidding documents and operating procurement procedures have steadily
improved as a result of the work of the consultants and by association with the
Bank so that in many'fields consultan'ts''are no longer essential.  I'n the financialI
area, implementati'o'n of the principle of automatic recovery of increased fuel costs
from customers is a significant step forward. So also is the general acceptance
of the concept of working towards a specific financial goal of an 8X rate of
return on revalued assets.   Even in respect of a matter such as revaluation on
which there is no agreement in developed countries as to principles and methods,
principles and methods have been agreed and implemented.
7.02       Because of inadequate tariff levels and a,large expansion program in a
period of high inflation, TEK has been unable to generate an adequate level of
cash to support the power sector investment needs, and internal and external
borrowings to support the investment program contributed substantially to the
economic crisis faced by the Government in 1977/78. TEK still has a critical
liquidity problem and it is unable to apply such remedies as are provided in
the law to secure the prompt payments of outstanding bills. The decline in
q!uality of its professional staff  is still a problem.  These
fundamental problems, which drained the vitality of TEK, are shared by
other SEEs to substantially the same degree and their solution, requiring
political wilingness, does not seem possible through application of normal
project lending methods which focus on only a single sector. Subsequently,
the Bank has *ade a deliberate effort to deal with these problems on a country
basis, although without tangible progress as yet, and this was reflected in
subsequ-nt loans for TER (1023-TU of June 28, 1974 and 1194-TU of June 14, 1976),
so the dialogue is continuing.

Our Ref: 610/DBK.I-901/
Subject: Loan No. 568-TU
FINAL REPORT
Ref: a) Your letter dated 25th September, 1974
b) Your letter dated 12th February, 1975
Our comments relating to the subjects referred in (a) and (b) above,
have been submitted herewith.
As it is known, the Final Report dated 2nd December 1975
prepared on the works in the scope of the credit, which were accomplished
by our Consultant Firm, has been submitted to your Bank. At this Report,
the activities cartied through this work - from the initial stage to the
end - and the critics on the work have been adequately explained by our
Consultants. The Report had provided all the necessary information for
your Bank, with the exception of the supply of the G8kqekaya-Ankara line,
while the situation of this line on the time this Report was written, had
been also explained. In any case, we deem it necessary to give explanations
on the matters below.
As it is known, Keban-Ankara-Istanbul power transmission line and
Ankara-G8k9ekaya-Istanbul power transmission line and the substations connected
to these lines have been the first 380-kV installations erected in our country.
For this reason, some delays and faults have been experienced in the erection
of the aforementioned-substations and transmission lines. However, the major
reasons of these delays are due to the various crises and circumstances faced
in the world as well as in Turkey. In spite of this, due to the major delays
occurred in the G8kcekaya and Keban power stations the termination dates have
been extended for about 1, 5-2 years and the substation investments have been
slowed down in the initial stage, with the aim to avoid unnecessary investments.
In addition, due to the rapid increase in the pricesin the world and Turkey
markets no installation work other than Ankara-G8kqekaya line have caused delays
in the utilization of the energy produced by the Keban and G8kqekaya power
stations.
Upon the abolishment of the contracts drawn with a foreign
and a local contractor, the installation of the Umraniye and G8lbasi
substations and the Kayseri capacitor stations as well as the erection of the
Keban-Ankara line and the G8k;ekaya-Ankara line through our Force Account and

our own means, though limited, a team has been created which is qualified in
separate project an erection work. By this team which was trained in these
works, the 380-kV Seyit8mer and Izmir substations, as well as the 380-kV
G8kqekaya-Seyit8mer and Izmir substations, as well as the 380-kV G8kjekaya-
Seyit8mer-Izmir and Seyit8mer-Seydisehir transmission lines have been ins-
talled by the initiative of our Organization.
The costs of the mentioned installations have been far beyond the
estimated costs, due to the delays and the crisis faced in the world and
Turkey markets, as well as the big price increases. The lack of experience
of our Organization from the administrative and personnel point of view,
which is a newly-created entity, is also attributable to these results.
Moreover, the laws , formalities, organization problems, impossibilities in
recruiting and retaining technical staff and many other barriers, have effected
this.
The major reasons for not being able to realize the aforesaid installa-
tions in the desired level and time, in parallel to your requests in the above-
said letters, could be summarized as follows. We would highly appreciate if
you would accept our regrets and show consideration to us for not being able
to prepare a report of such a large scale requested by you, due to the resigna-
tion of our trained and qualified staff during this period.
a) Due to the rapid charges in the prices, rate of exchange, circumstances
in the world and Turkey and the skyrocketing price increase in the materials such
as oil, steel, etc., the main problem has been the disputes occurred with the
contractors due to their delays which resulted with the cancellation of
certain contracts, thus putting us in a position of completing the works by
our Force Account, for which we were not equipped beforehand.
Great delays have taken place in the completion of the Protec-
tion projects. Delays of up to 2 years have been observed in the projects
which were to be completed within 4 months following the date of bidding
and due to this reason, the procurement of the protection material has been
prolonged. However, through the big efforts of the TEK erection team,
the control panel production, erection, cabling setting and testing works
have been finalized and the substations have been brought to a position
ready for operation, before the power station was ready for operation. In
order to minimize the prices and these effects, TEK, despite the shortage
of its experience, has shown a great effort to eliminate the troubles and
inefficiency of various contractors and a foreign consultant firm, and
have finalized the works.
b) The performance of a foreign consultant firm, with the
exception of the delays in the services carried in his own country could be
deemed as successful. However, we believe that the consultants have not
been able to give us the necessary assistance, due to the fact that, the
Company has not sent qualified staff to Turkey during the erection phase,

The design of the poles used in the lines have been made according
to very light assumptions and the meteorological conditions of the country
could not be estimated. For these reasons, by observing that 12 poles have
fell down in the initial stage in Izmit during summer and the poles between
Keban-Kayseri have fell down in the operation stage, it has been concluded that,
the distribution of the poles have not been carried on in a proper manner. The
falling down of the poles--in the erection stage--in the Keban line took place
due to our fault in taking some measures.
c) No difficulties have occurred in the disbursements and procurements
except the formalities and the credit has enabled us to have responsive bids
and facilitated the payment procedure. Moreover, we have not faced any diffi-
culties in transfer and financement.
However, we would like to emphasize that, the requests made for reports
on subjects with great coverage and beyond the scope of TEK, which we believe,
do not have direct relation with the credit highly occupies our staff, who are
in limited number and are already loaded with heavy work. This request causes
further delays in our other activities. It would be much more easier for us
to work, if information of less detailed nature could be requested.
d) The comments on the Bank transactions which cause to problems
are herewith attached (Annex 1).
e) Owing to the Keban-Gokcekaya Project and the credits, our technical
and administrative staff have been trained, both in Turkey and abroad, and
have reached a level capable to construct the 380-kV lines and substations,
without the assistance of consultancy. Therefore, from now on, the projects
could be accomplished by TEK's technical staff, which is a very great improvement.
However, in order to attract and retain qualified and experienced
technical staff our organization needs to be equipped with the necessary means.
f) Any kind of deviation has not been observed in the main financement
plan, except the price increase.
g) The energy capacity of Turkey has shown an increase about 40%,
through the Keban-Gokcekaya Projects, which forms the main framework of our
interconnected system. This Project has made a great contribution to the
development, industrialization and the flourishment of the social standard, as
well as the extension of energy to our rural areas.
h) It is primarily essential that, in order to derive maximum benefit
from the Project, the investments for the other transmission,distribution plants--
which would be-used for the sale, transmission and distribution of the energy

obtained from the Keban and Gokcekaya system--should be increased and with prior
consideration to training facilities, all the measures should be taken in order
to retain adequate number of technical staff--for the construction of projects,
installations, thus being able to reach to the level of industrialized nations.
With the exception of a few qualified specialists who would assist us
in solving the problems--which are few--arise during the research, planning,
project, design and erection works, we do not necessarily need specialists to
such a great extent.
By our explanations we do hope that we have replied to your questions
asked through your above referred letter and verbally. In case you should find
some points in our report unsatisfactory please note that we shall be at your
disposal to clarify such points.
We hope you will tolerate us for some missing points in report, if any.

COMMENTS APPLICABLE TO LOAN NO. 568-TU
1. Sometimes the Bank effect payment to the suppliers very late which
causes suppliers to write letters or send telex messages asking
why the payment has not been effected although the shipment has been
effected.
To avoid this the Bank can send a notification to the related supplier
stating that they have received the payment application and the payment
will be effected in the earliest convenience.
2. The Bank should send a statement quarterly or half yearly showing the actual
disbursements and the balance of the loan which will be useful to keep
tract of the loan simultaneously with the Bank so the over usage of the
loan will be prevented.
Our withdrawal applications consist of three pages and on every page the
same informations are repeated. To avoid these repetitions the information
can be given on one page.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
1818 H Street, N.W.,                        Our ref:  610/DBK.II-901/381
Washington, D.C. 20433
Subject: Loan No. 763-TU
U.S.A.
Final Report
Y. Ref: Your letter dated Jan. 26, 1977
As you know, the loan No. 763-TU for US$ 24.000.000 is
not a project loan but is a credit granted to meet a part of our
foreign exchange requirement that is necessary to finance the
installation, revision and extension of 1330 MVA substations and
2800 km long 154 and 30 kV power transmission lines which will be
connected to the interconnected system.
The substations and lines to be financed under this
credit have been shown in our 1972 investment program. However due
to our urgent needs that may occur in later years the program
for 1972 has been changed and the funds have been transferred to
the installations included in our program for 1973 and 1974. The
names of substations and lines after the use of this credit have
been shown on the attached listsl/.
The credit No. 763-TU was intended to be used for the
completion of the equipment necessary for the substations which
have already been built and for the installation of new
substations which have just been included in the program.
The equipment to be procured under this credit are used:
1) In the installation of new substations,
2) In the completion of equipment for the substations
which have been built,
3) To increase the power of some substations which are
in operation,
4) For addition of feeders which became necessary as
the result of growth in the networks,

5) As system spares.
Number of substatidns, the equipment for which is to be
procured through 763-TU is 136,
- Number of substations in which the
transformers will be installed              : 114
- Number of transformers                      : 139
- Transformer power                           : 3405 MVA
- Transformer power expected by this
credit                                      : 1330 MVA
- Transformer power procured through
credit                                         2075 MVA
- Number of transformers procured
through the credit                          : 48
- Number of substations in which
transformers were installed                    34
As seen on the above table, in the 1973 investment
program it was planned that 139 each 3405 MVA transformers were
to be financed through this credit. In the credit agreement, however,
credit has been granted for 1330 MVA transformers. On the other hand,
due to our urgent need, 48 each 25, 50 and 100 MVA transformers
which are not manufactured in Turkey have been financed under this loan.
The remaining 91 each 1430 MVA transformers were obtained through the
TEK's own means. The names of substations on which the transformers
were installed are listed on the attached table 1!.
A list showing the names of substations where the power transformers,
circuit breakers, capacitors that obtained under this loan and the
names of transmission lines is also attached.
It must be considered normal that during the 4 years
period between the validity date of loan agreement and the
completion of foreign expenditures there had to be changes on some
projects. For this is a program credit and using it for the urgent
needs will be more advantageous for the Turkish economy.
The equipment that is financed through the 763-TU credit,
ha- been ordered on the "stock order" basis. That is, instead of
orcering the complete equipment for each substation, all the
necessary equipment have been ordered on the whole for the overhead
lines and substations which were decided beforehand, as separate
items. Besides, this is the policy TEK has carried out for a long
time in the obtainment of equipment.

The 80% of overhead lines and substations on which
these equipment was used, has been completed by January 1977.
It is expected that the remaining part will be completed within
6 months, that is the end of June 1977. This result can be
considered as a good proof that the use of this credit has fulfilled
the requirements.
In the scope of project, in section A (1) 380 kV
equipment has been planned for Adapazari, Kayseri and Umraniye
substations and also for 380 kV Kayseri substation the capacity
of serial capacitor banks were to be increased.
As the final study and planning in our 380 kV system
during the validity of this credit has not been completed and
the production installation to be connected to the 380 kV system
was delayed, it was not possible to obtain equipment through
this credit for the above mentioned substations. Besides, as
you know the new credit No. 1194-TU has been granted for our
380 kV system.
In the section A (1) of the project for Istanbul,
100 MVAR capacitors were planned. We have ordered a total of 156
MVAR capacitors to be used not only for Istanbul but for all places
in our system which require capacitors. The 84 MVAR of these
capacitors have been mounted in Istanbul. The remaining 72 MVAR
have been mounted in the TEK interconnected system where required.
The general comments on the credit:
There has not been a big problem during the carrying
out of the credit. However, the procedures such as before sending
them to the firms sending of specifications to the Bank for approval
as required by the credit agreement and obtaining the Bank's approval
after the award is made, cause a certain amount of delay on the
orders. Yet, both Bank and TEK did their best co complete the
procedures in promptness.
Another point regarding this credit is that by our last
order we exceeded the limitation of the credit. By covering this
small amount through our own sources, however, this problem has been
solved.
No consulting firm has been engaged for this credit.
As it is known, conformity with the specifications and responsiveness
have been the basic criterion for selection among the supplier firms
and the firm has been chosen within this framework. Generally, the
firms have not caused any delays in the delivery of material and no
important trouble has been faced during the application term of the
credit.
The costs of the above-said installations have been far
beyond the estimations, due to the delays and the crisis faced in



Attachment 2
-36 -                            Page 4 of 6
the World and Turkey markets, as well as the big price increases.
The shortage of experience of our Organization from the administrative
out personnel point-of-view, which is a newly-created body, is also
attributable to these results. Moreover, the laws, formalities,
organizational problems, and impossibilities in recruiting and re-
taining technical personnel and many other barriers have effected this.
The major reasons for not being able to realize the
afore-said installations in the desired level and time, in parallel
to your requests in the above-shown letters, could be summarized as
follows. We would highly appreciate if you would accept our regrets
and show consideration to us for not being able to prepare a report
of such a magnitude, due to the resignation of our trained out
qualified staff during this period.
a) Due to the rapid change in the prices, rates of
exchange, circumstances in the world and Turkey as well as the
skyrocketing price increases in the materials such as oil, steel,
etc., the costs have shown a great increase.
As it is known, all the projects, specifications,
material procurements and erections have been accomplished by TEK.
The bureaucratic obstacles and excess of formalities have resulted
in delays in the material procurements.
b) There hasn't been any problems in the performance of
the contractors and consultants during the utilization of this credit.
c) No difficulties have occured in the disbursements
and procurements except the formalities, bureaucratic barriers.
The credit has enabled us to have responsive bids and facilitated
the payment procedure. For this reason, there hasn't been any
transfer and financement difficulties.
However, we would like to emphasize that, the requests
made for reports on subjects with great coverage and beyond the scope
of TEK, which we believe, do not have direct relation with the
credit highly occupies our staff, who are in limited number and
are already loaded with heavy work. These requests cause further
delays in our other activities. It would be very useful for us, if
information of less detailed nature could be requested.
d) Comments on Bank transactions which cause to problems
is submitted herewith (Annex 1).
e) The 154-kV transmission lines and substations have
been by our Organization and our technical staff, without the
assistance of the consultants. However in order to retain trained
staff in the Organization should be equipped with the facilities
which could attract qualified and trained staff in adequate number,
who would have access to foreign languages. This is a matter of status.



Attachment 2
Page 5 of6
f) In the main financement plan, any kind of problem has
not been observed, with the exception of the price increase and
changes in the plans. The material which was not provided through
the Loan, have been obtained by our own resources.
g) A great development, industrialization and a great
vitality and various benefits in the social life have been achieved
by the transmission lines and substations installed through the
763-TU Loan. Moreover energy has been extended to many rural areas
deprived of electrical energy.
h) In order to derive maximum benefit from the lines and
substations installed through the Loan 763-TU, it is necessary to
construct new lines and substations to be connected to those. For
increasing the investments, the financement should be obtained
beforehand and the facilities should be provided in order to recruit
and retain technical staff. The training of the technical staff is
also an important factor.
The personnel who would do the research, planning,
project design and erection work should also be provided with adequate
possibilities.
By our explanations we do hope that we have replied to
your questions asked through your above referred letter and verbally.
In case you should find some points in our report unsatisfactory
please note that we shall be at your disposal to clarify such points.
We hope you will tolerate us for some missing points in
report, if any.

TURKEY
TEK TRANSMISSION PROJECT I (LOAN 763-TU)
Reasons for the Difference Between Forecast and Actual Demands
1.        The main reason for the slowdown in the estimated load growth has been
the slowdown of industrial and economic activity in the country coupled with
a shortage of generating plant due to delays in the construction of new plants
and the breakdown of major plants in service. The investment programs and
construction lead times assumed by Turkish planners proved to have been unrealistic
in the light of the financial, human and other resources available to TEK and
DSI since 1970, as illustrated by the following instances. In 1970, they antici-
pated commissioning of the Elbistan Lignite Power Project in 1976 (now expected
in 1982), a nuclear power plant in 1977 (now expected in the nineties), the
Oymapinar hydroelectric plant in 1978 (now expected in 1982) and the Karakaya
hydroelectric plant in 1979 (now expected in 1986). In 1970, the serious financial
and manpower constraints which considerably slowed down all subsequent construction
activity could not be foreseen. In the event, because of drastic delays in
the construction of generating plants, power supply in Turkey was woefully in-
adequate at least from 1972. The stop-gap and costly arrangement of erecting
combustion turbines to meet the power supply situation only alleviated the problem
and could not solve it. To make matters worse, major generating plants, such
as the Keban and Ambarli plants, also suffered from technical problems, damages
and fires, as well as a shortage of fuel oil. The Ambarli power plant (3x110 MW)
was out of commission on account of a cable fire from June 6, 1977 until mid-
August 1977. Keban III and IV went out of commission on June 8, 1977 on account
of the malfunctioning of certain safety mechanisms and could be brought back
into operation only in September-October 1977.
2.        As a result of the above delays and breakdowns, power consumption had
for some years to be physically restricted to the available generation. TEK
has taken several measures to restrict power consumption, such as regular and
daily power cuts of five to six hours' duration in all large cities, load shedding
and frequency and voltage reductions. No systematic attempts have been made to
assess the magnitude of power supply restrictions in Turkey or to evaluate the
losses to the national economy caused by these restrictions.
3.        The load forecasts beyond three years, i.e. from 1973 onwards, were also
somewhat optimistic. Such medium-term load forecasts cannot be precisely determined
and an error of the order of + 10% is not unusual.    It will be seen that while
the actuals for 1970 and 1971 were close to the forecasts (5,606 GWh vs. forecast
of 5,820 in 1970; 7,013 GWh vs. forecast of 7,508 in 1971), the actual for 1979
was 16% short of the forecast. One reason for the large divergence between the
medium-term forecasts and the actuals is that large industrial loads failed to
materialize as planned owing to changes in the economy and other factors. The
following are illustrative examples of major lags in industrial consumption. In



- 42 -                          Attachment 5
Page 2 of 2
1970, it was expected that the Aluminum and Ferro-Chrome industries would in
1977 reach an annual consumption of 1,500 GWh and 740 GWh respectively; however,
their actual consumption even in 1980 is of the order of only 500 GWh and
150 GWh respectively. The cement industry was estimated to reach an annual
consumption of 485 GWh in 1977 but the actual consumption in that year turned
out to be only 150 GWh.
