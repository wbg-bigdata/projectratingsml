APPRAISAL OF
BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01         The Socialist Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina (SRBH) is located in
the south central part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY)
adjoining the Adriatic Sea with about 20 km of coast line. Triangular in
shape, it comprises 51,129 square kilometers or 20% of the total area of
SFRY. It has a population of 4.2 million or 19% of the total population of
SFRY. Bosnia-Herzegovina is one of Yugoslavia's least developed regions; 1979
per capita income was $1,695, 68% of the national average.
1.02         The proposed project consists of two separate components;
agroindustries, consisting of a number of different food processing plants in
Bosnia, and Popovo Polje development, a small somewhat experimental investment
in irrigation, drainage and on-farm production in a karst valley in
Herzegovina. Agroindustries comprise about 80% of the estimated investment
cost. The project would follow and support three agricultural credit projects
(1129-YU, 1477-YU and 1801-YU) in which SRBH is participating and an
agricultural and agroindustry project supported by the Bank in the Bosanska
Krajina region of SRBH (1616-YU). A three-volume preparation report of the
proposed project, dated February 1980, was received in the Bank at the end of
March 1980 and a Bank identification mission held discussions in mid-April
with officials of the SRBH government and the proposed borrower, Privredna
Banka Sarajevo (PBS). The Government indicated that the proposed project
included the highest priority investments of the 1981-85 plan period for which
IBRD support was sought. Bank missions during October and December 1980 and
February/March 1981 advised and guided PBS and the investors in further
project preparation. This report is based on the findings of an appraisal
mission of Messrs. R. Hunt (Leader/Economist), M. Tirmazi (Irrigation
Engineer), S. Ahmed (YP/Economist), F. Wright (Financial Analyst), Bank, and
Mrs. E. Garibaldi (Horticulturalist) and Mr. C. Cronberg (Agroindustries
Engineer), Consultants.
II. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Contribution to the Economy
2.01         The contribution of agriculture to the overall economies of SFRY
and SRBH is summarily quantified in Table 2.1.

2.02    As expected in an industrializing economy, agriculture's share of
total material output is declining. However, in SRBH, agriculture's share of
the total output is increasing marginally. This is all the more remarkable in
view of agriculture's relatively small share of total investment, which peaked
in SRBH at 7.7% in 1973 and declined to around 6% thereafter. This was due to
a very large build up of investment in the individual sector, which also
peaked in 1973 and declined to more normal levels in the following years.
Agriculture's shares in population and exports are, as to be expected,
declining in both SFRY and SRBH though still significant.
B. Performance
2.03    Recent performance in agricultural production in both SFRY and SRBH is
summarized in Table 2.2 below;

2.04     Agricultural production in SRBH grew a little faster than in SFRY as
a whole, although in neither case was growth very impressive. The growth rate
of 2.65% annually is only slightly better than the world average over the same
period, which is not a very good performance for a well advanced developing
country with a firm policy of expanding agricultural production. Per capita
food supply has grown at an even slower rate due to population growth of
almost 1% annually. With the decline in output in 1980 growth performance
suffers correspondingly.

2.05     Land use in in Table 2.3 shows SRBH as rather similar to SFRY.  The
major difference is that its agricultural and arable areas as shares of its
total area (50% and 21%) are somewhat less than the average for SFRY (56% and
28%), due to its mountainous terrain. The sum of the cropped areas in SFRY is
1% greater than the area of arable land indicating a small presence of double
cropping, most probably in vegetables. In SRBH this sum is actually 14% less
than the area of arable land indicating that part of the arable land is either
fallowed or abandoned. This situation has prevailed in SRBH at least since
1960.  Arable area has been declining by 0.6% annually over that time, thus
the slightly superior performance of SRBH agriculture (Table 2.2) is due to
productivity growth.
D. Production Structure
2.06     The structure of agricultural production is outlined in Table 2.4
below. Agriculture is the only sector of the economy which is predominantly
privately owned; about 84% of the country's arable land belong to nearly 2.2
million individual farmers (average size of holdings, 3.5 ha), who constitute
about 89% of the agricultural labor force. The individual sector exists side
by side with social sector agro-kombinats, who hold about 16% of the arable
land and produce about 28% of the nation's agricultural output; this position
reflects the better land, more irrigation, modern technology, and larger
capital inputs of the social sector. The relative performance of the social
and individual sectors in agriculture can be gauged from the ratios of
production, investment and livestock to arable land.

For the country as a whole productivity per arable ha in the social sector is
only about twice as great as in the individual sector, while annual investment
per ha is about 3 times that of the individual sector. This ratio also holds
for tractors. The individual sector has almost 90% of all livestock, but its
performance in terms of stocking rate is still 40% better than that of the
social sector. In terms of production efficiency, the aggregate performance
of the individual sector appears to be superior to that of the social sector.
This in part reflects the pattern of output where the emphasis, in the
individual sector, is on higher valued animal products. Crop yields per ha
and output per animal are greater in the social sector than in the private
sector, but this is only to be expected given the quantity and quality of
inputs.
E. Food Processing Industry
2.07    Agroindustries in general and food processing in particular have been
the focus of investment in SFRY. In 1978 estimated investment in food
processing totalled Din 46.5 billion or 4.4% of estimated total investment
expenditures. For SRBH this amounted to Din 4.6 billion or 2.7% of SRBH's
total investment expenditures. For 1969 these numbers were Din 4.1 billion or
2.8% for SFRY and Din 185.6 billion or 0.8% for SRBH. As indicated by these
data, food processing investment in SRBH continues to be well behind the
national average. Superficially, this would seem easily amended by increasing
investment. However, the spate of investment in the past decade appears to
have generated problems of over-capacity in the industry in general in the
sense that processing capacity now well exceeds the volume of raw material
available for a number of products. Table 2.5 shows current utilization
levels for a variety of food processing activities for SFRY, which range from



25% for frozen fruit processing to 80% for fresh milk processing. For meat,
utilization is 60% for slaughtering and 75% far processing (cured and smoked
meats, sausages and salami, etc.). Table 2.6 shows 1979 utilization figures,
by Republic, for food processing industries of interest to the project; namely
flour mills, dairy products, vegetable oil and meat.

2.08    The general implication of Table 2.5 is that substantial
underutilization occurs in non milk dairy product plants (mainly cheese) and
also in meat slaughtering. The difference in utilization levels for meat
slaughtering and processing can be explained by the prevailing output price



policy. Fresh meat prices are tightly controlled by the Federal Government at
levels well below the equivalent live animal price, whereas processed meat
prices are established on a cost-plus basis. Consequently it is most
profitable to process as much meat as possible. This does not explain the
differences in utilization levels for different types of dairy plants, which
appears related to the specialized nature of the individual plants.
2.09    Price policy and the decentralized decision-making process have given
rise to significant resource misallocation problems in terms of
over-investment in agroindustries facilities relative to primary production.
Investment programs appear to be based on an optimistic view of economic
conditions rather than pragmatic analysis. Domestic banks are controlled by
the social enterprise investors, and so have very little direct influence over
the allocation of investments. Finally, bankruptcy is rare due to
subsidization either from within the enterprise or by the regional funds
established for this purpose. In practice, the use of these funds can slow
the rationization and, in some instances, this may compound the resource
misallocation problem. However, in view of the decision to restrict the
volume of new investment during the current plan and to narrow the number of
priority sectors, new investment projects are being given considerably more
scrutiny than in the past. Currently, a detailed study of agroindustry
capacity is being undertaken by the Federal authorities which should help in
improving regional coordination and investment efficiency in this subsector.
2.10    In view of possible over-capacity, the Bank has been emphasizing the
need to concentrate on reconstruction/modernization rather than on new
construction. By adopting a least-cost solution approach during preparation
and appraisal, the present project incorporates this strategy. The project
would finance replacement of existing capacity for wheat flour mills and a
vegetable oil extraction plant. The existing plants are almost 30 years old
and long overdue for replacement. In fact the vegetable oil plant is in
danger of exploding, while hexane leakages may be affecting the health of the
operators. Also, as seen from Table 2.6, capacity utilization for these in
SRBH is 85% for flour mills and 98% for oil mills which is quite high.
Poultry slaughtering and vegetable preservation/storage provide examples of
investments to relieve bottlenecks; both are specialized investments. In the
case of poultry existing capacity utilization in SRBH is 100%, while 40% of
the required input is already in production and being processed in an old
slaughterhouse. The remainder is already contracted for. With vegetables a
seasonal production surplus exists, much of which is lost as the area is far
from major markets.
F. Development Strategy
2.11    In the past, Yugoslavia's agricultural development strategy has been
to promote growth of social sector agriculture as the principal means to
achieve large-scale market production and self sufficiency in food. The
agro-kombinats which comprise the social sector are vertically integrated
enterprises engaged in production, processing, distribution and marketing of
agricultural commodities. They consist of Basic Organizations of Associated
Labor (BOALs), which specialize in self-contained production processes or
marketing. Two or more BOALs, in similarly linked activities, join to make up
a work organization (WO). Two or more WOs join to make a Composite
Organization of Associated Labor (COAL); the total organization, in the
agricultural sector, is called an Agro-Kombinat (AIK).



2.12     Individual sector development is sought through long-term association
of individual farmers into Basic Cooperative Organizations (BCO) 1/ associated
with AIKs. The BCOs give farmers a number of advantages including: retention
of individual land titles; assured markets and access to AIK technical
know-how; access to credit and inputs; participation in social sector health
and pension schemes; and participation in the decision making process for AIK
development programs which directly affect the individual's welfare.
Disadvantages to the individual include some loss of flexibility and, in many
cases, lower product prices paid by the BCO. Because they make allowances for
BCO operating and overhead costs, which in many cases may be higher than in
the private sector, product prices paid to individual producers are in some
cases too low to provide adequate incentives to expand production. Prices
however are usually announced in advance of the new growing season and
individuals are not compelled to contract with BCOs and AIKs. In principle
the system appears to be a well reasoned policy response to the need to
increase on-farm production. However, in practice it appears to have been
less successful than one might expect. The reasons for this are not yet
clear. Some indications suggest that at present the scheme does not offer
sufficient financial incentives to individual producers while others attribute
it to the need to overcome initial inertia due to past stagnation and
traditional disinclination to be tied to social sector organizations.
2.13     SFRY's draft agricultural development plan (1981-85) aims at an
annual 4% production growth; the social sector is expected to grow at 6%; the
individual sector, 4%. Agroindustries, a priority activity, are expected to
grow by 7% annually. The plan's strategy is based on continued development of
social sector holdings and increased cooperation with the individual farm
sector. The slower growth targeted for the individual sector reflects its
present limited absorptive capacity and the difficulties in providing large
numbers of small farmers with appropriate inputs and markets. It also
suggests that the factors inhibiting increased output and modernization in the
individual agricultural sector are still to be addressed.
2.14     The draft agricultural development plan of SRBH has a similar overall
production growth rate of 4%, of which 8% is pLanned for the social sector and
3.5% for the individual sector. No details of investment targets are yet
available, but emphasis appears to be on improving the productivity of
agricultural land and increasing the arable area, particularly in the social
sector. Stress is also laid on increasing the production of beef and dairy
products through increased forage production and improved use of pastures. In
both cases it is intended to expand and intens[fy cooperative arrangements
between the social and individual sectors to assist in achieving the targeted
growth. Agroindustry capacity is also to be expanded where necessary to
provide processing outlets for this increased production.
1/ BCO is used to denote different forms of Basic Organizations which
cooperate with individual farmers under the Law of Associated Labor. These
forms range from BCOs made up entirely of individual farmers, to varying
degrees of mix between individual farmers and the social sector and are
referred to variously as Basic Cooperative Organizations, Basic
Organizations of contract farmers, Basic Organizations of Cooperants, BOAL
for cooperation with individual sector, and Zadruga.

2.15     Details of how the growth targets are to be achieved were not
provided, but, in view of the recent past growth rate in the 2.2% - 2.7% range
annually, the planned figure of 4% is ambitious. Total meat production, which
since 1967 has grown at about 5.5% annually, is planned to grow at a rate of
about 0.6% annually while similar figures for cows' milk production are 5.6%
annually since 1967 and 3.3% annually through 1985. In view of the superior
past growth rates these planned growth rates should be readily achievable, but
hardly contribute to an expanded overall growth rate. However the slightly
declining cattle herd will inevitably militate against their achievement. For
field crops, wheat production, which has declined at an annual rate of -0.7%
since 1967, is planned to increase by 9.2% annually and for maize the
comparative growth rates are 2.9% and 5.6% annually. The strategy now appears
to concentrate more heavily on field crop production, but the targets appear
overly ambitious.
2.16     The development strategy also begins to address the problems of some
of SRBH's least developed areas. Popove Polje as a karst-type valley near
the Adriatic, flooded in winter and drought prone in summer, is representative
of many similar agricultural poverty pockets along the coastal area of SFRY.
As part of its social commitment, Government policy in both SFRY and SRBH is
to endeavour to alleviate the situation while at the same time expand the area
of arable land. Within the Herzegovina area, these valleys are the only
agricultural resource base available. The development of this area under the
proposed project should serve as a guide to the future development of other
such karstic valleys in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Montenegro.
G. Bank Strategy in the Agricultural Sector
2.17     The Bank's strategy in SFRY's agricultural sector has been to support
the development of primary production in the individual sector in recognition
of the fact that the major output increases can be expected to come from the
largest resource block. It has also supported agroindustrial expansion in the
social sector as the marketing channel for farm production where this has been
economically justified from the regional and national point of view.  This
strategy also recognizes the need to use investment to promote a more
equitable income distribution by raising the incomes of the rural poor, and
alleviate severe rural-urban migration. The Bank also recognizes that
investments in the social sector are both necessary and complementary to its
efforts at the farm level. The proposed investment would be the Bank's second
direct loan to SRBH and its thirteenth to SFRY for agriculture and
agroindustries. It is consistent with the above Bank strategy. Two projects
have recently been completed, Macedonia Agroindustries I (894-YU) and
Agricultural Credit I (1129-YU); no project completion or performance audit
reports have yet been issued. A completion report for the Macedonia
Agroindustries I Project is now under preparation.
H. Performance Under Previous World Bank Projects
2.18     The borrower under this project, Privredna Banka Sarajevo-Udruzena
Banka (PBS), has been one of the participating banks in all three Agricultural
Credit Projects, four Industrial Credit Projects (Loans Nos. 1013-YU, 1277-YU,
1612-YU and 1910-YU), and the borrower for the Bosanska Krajina Agriculture
and Agroindustries Project (Loan No. 1621-YU). The first Agricultural Credit



- 9 -
Project has been completed, as has the Bosnia-Herzegovina Industrial Credit
Project. Implementation of the two other Agricultural Credit projects is
progressing, but behind schedule. Overall commitment levels under the Third
Agricultural Credit Project are closer to the original appraisal schedule but,
due to the lag in the Second Agricultural Credit Project, disbursements as of
December 1981 are only 8% of the loan amount vs. a 14.1% appraisal estimate.
However, under this loan, performance of PBS has been better than most other
participating banks, with commitment of about 95% and disbursements of 7%.
The problems are due in large part to the general inflationary situation, past
deterioration in the balance of payments and current corrective measures. The
Yugoslav authorities are taking these implementation problems seriously and
have taken some specific measures (e.g. granting priority status to Bank
project related imports, increasing availability of local credit) to reduce
the effects of the overall economic corrective measures on implementation of
Bank financed projects. The Bosanska Krajina Project is two years behind
schedule, which can be attributed to domestic resource constraints fueled by
high rate of inflation and organizational shortcomings in PBS. The management
has recently taken important measures to supervise sub-projects, monitor
implementation and liaise with AIPK (Agroindust:rijske i Prometni Kombinat
Bosanska Krajina), the executing agency, more closely. These steps are
contributing towards faster project implementation and resolving specific
project problems.
2.19     Under the Sixth Industrial Credit Project to be presented to the
Executive Directors in FY82 for which PBS is a borrower and as well as for
this project, agreements have been reached to strengthen PBS's project
supervision and coordination capacity by expanding the staff in its
supervision unit for Bank financed projects, and engaging services of
consultants where necessary.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Concept and Objectives
3.01     The project was conceived within the context of the general
agricultural development strategy of both SFRY and SRBH. Basically this
involves expanding primary production to meet ,growing domestic and export
demand as well as provide facilities and services to process and market this
production. Within this strategy SRBH gives priority to investments in
relatively low income areas. Primary production is now being supported by a
series of Bank-financed agricultural projects. The agroindustries component
of the proposed project has the specific objective of providing processing and
marketing facilities for such output. The specific subprojects are among the
priority investments of SRBH. The project strategy emphasizes reconstruction
and modernization of existing agroindustrial capacity with replacement only
occurring when the efficient life of a plant has passed.  New construction is
only included where it has been clearly demonstrated that the incremental raw
material input is either already present or the necessary on-farm investment
is taking place. This is in line with the Bank's investment policy for
Yugoslavia as a whole, which is to take a nation-wide pespective on investment
decision-making. Raw material availability and marketing prospects are



- 10 -
analyzed on a national rather than regional basis. In this project,
agroindustrial investments have also been considered in the context of the
location and capacities of similar facilities throughout Yugoslavia.
3.02     The investments in agroindustries would all be undertaken by social
sector kombinats. These are large concerns containing reservoirs of many
different technical skills. For replacement plants these skills are already
available while for new capacities they should be able to be developed
rapidly. The technologies to be introduced in the project are relatively
sophisticated but have previously been introduced elsewhere in the country.
Consequently, project personnel can be readily familiarized with the new
technology. The wheat flour and vegetable oil mills are 25 to 30 years old,
quite decrepit and in need of replacement. Operating costs are unnecessarily
high in existing plants and throughput is too low due to frequent stoppages
for breakdowns. The vegetable processing plants and cold store are all part
of a single complex under one investor and are located in a designated
under-developed region of SRBH.  The investment will serve to reduce seasonal
surpluses, shortages and price fluctuations for locally produced vegetables
and expand demand for these by providing a means of offseason marketing. The
net result will be an increase in on-farm earnings, principally among
individual farmers.
3.03     Popovo Polje represents a classical agricultural poverty pocket.  In
the past, due to extreme seasonal variations in the level of the water table,
it had no productive agricultural prospects. Now, as a result of the
regulation and drainage of its river, the Trebisnjica, to accommodate a
hydroelectric scheme, the agricultural potential has been substantially
increased. The objective of this component is, through provision of
irrigation facilities, on-farm equipment and buildings, to produce
commercially marketable surpluses of fresh fruits (apples and table grapes),
wine grapes, vine rootstocks and grains, and to serve as a possible model for
the future development of similar karst valleys in the general region.
B. Project Content
3.04     The proposed project would consist of:
Agroindustries:
-    2 wheat flour mills, to replace exiting mills, and having a
combined total annual processing capacity of about 73,000 tons
of wheat;
-    a poultry slaughterhouse processing 10 million broilers annually;
-    a vegetable oil extraction plant, to replace an existing plant
with a higher capacity plant. It will process 77,000 tons of
oil seeds annually and will include a 50,000 ton seed storage
silo;
-    a vegetable processing and cold storage complex consisting of:
-    a vegetable pickling plant which will preserve 2,700 tons
of vegetables annually;
-    a cold store with an effective storage area of 7,200 m3; and
-    a vegetable freezing plant within the cold store and having
an annual intake of 5,320 tons of vegetables.



- II -
3.05     Popovo Polje;
-    underground pressure pipeline of asbestos cement pipes totalling
about 22 km in length to serve an area of about 1,170 ha;
-    2 pumping stations with capacities of about 0.3 and 0.8 m3/sec
and transmission lines and transformers to supply power to the
stations;
-    on-farm irrigation equipment;
-    on-farm roads and facilities for irrigation O&M;
-    on-farm buildings, tractors, machinery equipment;
-    fruit tree and vineyard rootstocks and trellising material; and
-    installation of an experimental drainage plot of about 10 ha.
3.06     Popovo Polje is located in a karstic valley, 221-225 meters above sea
level about 25 km north of Dubrovnik. The land has become suitable for
agricultural development following construction of two dams and the concrete
lining of the river bed for hydropower generation, eliminating the flooding of
Popovo Polje. Climatic conditions are characterized by warm summers (maximum
260C) and cold winters (mimimum 50C); periods of drought are not
uncommon. Annual precicipation averages 2,125 mm with the lowest months being
June, July and August (89, 67 and 88 mm). Project irrigation works consist of
an underground pressure pipeline of asbestos cement, two pumping stations
(including power lines and transformers) and sprinkler equipment (typhons).
While the soils in the project area have showr consistent improvement in
quality and are expected to improve faster after cultivation, some areas with
heavy soils may have a drainage problem. Thus a 10 ha experimental plot will
be fitted with tile drains to measure their usefulness in relieving high water
tables and aid soil amelioration. The investments would irrigate an area of
about 1,170 ha, of which about 900 ha is in the social sector and the
remainder farmed by individual families. While small in size the area is of
importance being the first phase for irrigaticn of the entire valley and more
importantly the first of a number of such karstic valleys intended to be so
developed. Production in the social sector will emphasize apples, table
grapes, vine rootstocks and maize while the irdividual sector will produce
wine grapes, maize and vegetables. The typhor irrigation equipment and
underground pipeline layout are shown on IBRD map No. 16025 Popovo Polje
Proposed Irrigation System. Details of the water requirements and
availability are contained in Annex 4.
C. Status of Design and Projezt Implementation
3.07     It is expected that physical implementation of the agroindustry
subprojects will begin in year 1 of the project (1982-83). However,
initiation of construction on at least some of the agroindustries may be
delayed due to the demand for construction capacity by the 1984 Winter
Olympics. In order to speed the procurement and design phase and to avoid
cost overruns, tendering and bid evaluation were required to be completed
prior to negotiations for processing equipment: for all agroindustry
subprojects. This will permit equipment contracts to be negotiated and signed
shortly and consequently enable civil works design to be completed by
September 1982 so that construction can begin thereafter.



- 12 -
3.08     The Popovo Polje irrigation system is completely designed.  Because
construction in the area is only possible in the summer months, construction
would take 4 summer periods. Details on costs, content and implementation are
contained in Annex 4.
D. Costs
3.09     Total project cost, excluding interest during construction and the
front-end fee, based on mid-1981 appraisal and revised and updated to
mid-1982, is estimated to be about Din 3.6 billion or US$82.2 million. This
estimate includes taxes and duties, physical and price contingencies and
incremental working capital. An allowance has been made in the base cost for
any delays which may be caused due to the demand for the construction capacity
by the 1984 Winter Olympics. Taxes and duties, included under local costs,
amount to 11% of the foreign exchange cost. Physical contingencies amount to
6% of base costs while price contingencies total 17% of the base investment
cost plus physical contingencies. These are based on Bank projected
international inflation rates together with estimated inflation rates in the
domestic construction industry as follows: 1982 (July-December) - 17.5%, 1983
- 25%, 1984 - 20% and 1985 - 20%. The local price contingencies are based on
historical trends and estimates of project authorities and local contractors
which suggest that price increases in the domestic construction industry,
particularly for cement and labor, are likely to be greater than general price
movements. These provisions for local price contingencies are justified by
project specific circumstances and uncertainties in price projections in a
period of major shifts in macro-economic policy leading to a marked decline in
overall inflation with different effects on different sectors.
3.10     The foreign exchange component is estimated to be approximately Din
1.5 billion or US$34.5 million, which amounts to 42% of the total cost. Cost
estimates reflect the exchange rate as of February 15, 1982 of Din 43.6784 =
US$1.

The proposed Bank loan of US$35 million would finance 43% of the total project
financing requirements equivalent to 100% of the foreign exchange cost
including the front end fee of US$517,241 (see Table 3.1).
3.12    The Bank loan would be for a period of 15 years including 3 years
grace.
F. Retroactive Financing
3.13    In order to avoid costly delays in implementation, ICB procurement in
accordance with Bank Procurement Guidelines for all agroindusty equipment was
required as a condition of negotiations. Bid evaluation reports, prepared in
accordance with procedures consistent with Bank Procurement Guidelines, have
been reviewed by the Bank. At the time of signing these equipment contracts
which is expected to be before the date of loan signing, a downpayment would
be required. In order not to delay this critical element, retroactive
financing of up to US$3.5 million is provided in order to assist in financing
the estimated foreign exchange component of these downpayments.
G. Environmental Impact
3.14    The subprojects are generally low level pollution generators and all
agroindustries investments would include adequate effluent treatment
facilities. Consequently the investments are expected to have no adverse
environmental impact on the subproject localities. Earth tremors are quite
common in SRBH. It is advisable that all civil works be designed and
constructed to withstand such expected disturbances. This is a general
practice in the area.

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization and Management
4.01    Privredna Banka Sarajevo (PBS) would be the Borrower under the
guarantee of SFRY Government.  PBS would undertake to provide all necessary
local finance over and above the subborrowers contribution, principally from
Federal and Republican investment funds as well as its basic bank's
resources. The subprojects would be implement:ed by the respective investors.
1/ As is current practice, the provision of inputs in kind to cooperants in
the individual sector within the Popovo Polje Irrigation system would be
through the Popovo Polje Work Organization, which would be the sub-borrower
from PBS. At most only 120 farm families would be involved.
B. The Borrower - Privredna Banka Sarajevo (PBS)
4.02    PBS is one of the participating banks in the First, Second and Third
Agricultural Credit Projects (Loans Nos. 1129--YU, 1477-YU and 1801-YU), and a
borrower from the Bank under Bosanska-Krajina Project (Loan No. 1621-YU) and
five Industrial Credit Projects since 1972. The purpose of banking in
Yugoslavia is to further social development. The social structure provides
that financial resources should be controlled by the workers who use them in
the production cycle. The ownership of the banks by social organizations,
which are in turn controlled by their workers, is intended to create an acute
awareness of the social needs of the society within the banks. Therefore, the
banks try to give priority to lesser developed communes in their regions.
Appraisal procedures followed by PBS have been generally acceptable. All
projects are first examined by member basic banks and those that exceed the
basic banks' resources or require foreign exchange or require republic/federal
investment funds are transferred to the associated bank for further detailed
appraisal. Supervision work by PBS under the Bosanska-Krajina project has not
been fully satisfactory. This situation is a result of insufficient staff
being assigned full time to coordinate and supervise the project. Steps have
been taken to resolve this situation under the Bosanska-Krajina Project (Loan
No. 1621-YU). The PBS staff's duties and responsibilities with regard to
implementation and supervision under the propcsed project have been fully
discussed and agreed upon during negotiations,
1/ A list of subproject locations and Investors is in Annex 6.



- 16 -
4.03    The financial condition of PBS must be examined within the context of
the Yugoslav economy. The banks in Yugoslavia are not profit maximizers, but
rather intend to earn an income which is adequate to cover expenses and to
make required allocations to various reserves. In this context, PBS has
maintained an adequate level of net income, and has been increasing its asset
base. The growth of PBS's long-term lending activity has brought about a 75%
increase in long-term deposits and borrowings in 1978 to 1980; consequently
its long-term debt equity ratio increased to 15.5 to 1 as of December 31,
1980. The majority of the long-term debts are Federal and Republic Funds
(42%) which, while treated as debt, have more the character of managed funds.
If these funds are excluded from the calculations, the ratio is reduced to 8.6
to 1. The primary sources of funds for PBS are long-term borrowing (32% of
end 1980 assets) and demand deposits (26%). The long-term borrowings are
mainly Federal and Republic funds, as well as IBRD loans and foreign loans.
PBS has a long-standing relationship with the Bank. Although project
implementation has been somewhat less than satisfactory, PBS has shown
institutional improvements over this time and is expected to continue to do
so. Its overall financial situation is generally satisfactory and PBS
continues to be credit worthy. Since all subprojects have been completely
appraised by the Bank and since the procurement process is substantially
underway, PBS implementation input under the project will be less than usual
and well within its capabilities.
C. Lending Policies and Procedures
4.04    As subproject appraisals have been completed by the Bank, no further
appraisal would be required of PBS, unless there are changes in the
subprojects. Should any such change in subprojects be proposed, or deemed by
the Bank to be introduced, then PBS would be required to carry out and send to
the Bank for its approval a full technical and economic subproject appraisal
report, in accordance with a format to be agreed upon at negotiations, prior
to any reimbursement for the subproject concerned. Assurances on this lending
procedure were obtained during negotiations.
D. On-Lending Terms
4.05    PBS will charge an interest rate of not less than 15% for domestic
bank funds. Interest rates for Governmental development investment funds such
as the Federal and Republican Funds shall reflect full charges prevailing for
these at the time the sub-loan agreement is concluded. Interest on Bank funds
will be 11.6% plus a 1.25% on-lending charge. The presently expected sources
and shares of funds together with the interest charges currently prevailing
for these are set below.
Source of        Contribution   Interest    Repayment
Funds               %           Rate %    Period Years    Remarks
Investor             20%           -             -           Average contribution
World Bank           43%          11.6          15            Including Front-End
Fee

only
Republican Fund      10%           4.0          15            Bosanski Samac only
Federal Fund         11%           6.0          15            (20% for Popovo Polje
15% to other)
Domestic Banks       16%          15.0          10            Local currency only



- 17 -
The overall weighted average interest rate is about 11.25%. If domestic
inflation increases at the official forecast rate of 13-15 percent during
1983-84, this would not be a real positive rate, but it does represent a
significant increase over the 8-10% rate charged in recent Bank agricultural
projects in SFRY. Understandings were reached, under a recent industrial
credit project, to the effect that the responsible Yugoslav authorities would
review with the Bank, at least annually, the interest rate policy in the light
of prevailing market conditions. The on-lending rate could thus be adjusted
corresponding to any changes in interest rate policy. As with previous Bank
financed agricultural projects in SFRY, the foreign exchange risk on all loans
to social sector enterprises would be borne by these enterprises. For all
subprojects PBS would determine the length of each subloan, including grace
and repayment periods from the cash flow analysis for each investment. Unless
otherwise agreed the subloan repayment period would be not more than 15 years
including not more than 5 years grace. PBS would take adequate steps to
protect itself against the exchange risks on its lending and borrowing
operations, including these subloan repayments accruing earlier than
amortization payments of the Bank loan. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that these on-lending terms would be implemented.
E. Procuremelat
4.06    All agroindustry processing equipment would be procured through ICB in
accordance with Bank Procurement Guidelines. This equipment, totalling about
US$22.9 million, includes flour milling equipment, vegetable oil extraction
equipment, poultry slaughterhouse equipment, vegetable pickling and freezing
equipment and cold storage equipment. Domestic manufacturers would receive a
15% margin of preference or the actual level of import duties whichever is
less for purposes of bid comparisons. The civil works related to these
agroindustrial processing equipment (US$43.1 million) would be procured
through local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank.
ICB would not be suitable for the construction of these civil works as these
contracts are relatively small (about US$5.2 million each) and unlikely to
attract foreign bidders. Even on turnkey type agroindustries projects,
foreign bidders have always subcontracted civil works to the local
construction industry.
4.07    Procurement and installation of equipment for two pumping stations
including transformers and transmission line (US$1.28 million) and on-farm
sprinkler equipment (US$0.94 million) for Porovo Polje irrigation subproject
(area 1,170 ha) would be procured through limited international tendering in
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. Quotations from at least
three different suppliers would be solicited. In view of the relatively small
size of these installations, but involving high degree of technology and
skills, this method of procurement has been considered as the most
appropriate. The civil works including underground asbestos cement pipeline
for this subproject (US$2.26 million) would be procured through LCB procedures
acceptable to the Bank.



- 18 -
4.08    Popovo Polje irrigation subproject also includes on-farm development
and some farm equipment. Farm equipment (US$1.97 million) would be procured
following LCB under procedures acceptable to the Bank. These diversified
pieces of locally manufactured equipment are required gradually, over the
entire period of development of the project and are best suited to this type
of procurement. Farm buildings (US$ 0.57 million) and other miscellaneous
items of works, principally trellising poles and wire, fertilizers, pesticides
and farm yard manure (US$4.09 million) would be procured through local
procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank and requiring at least three
quotations. These buildings and materials are required over the development
phase of the project and would be procured yearly according to requirements.
Procurement of fruit trees and vineyard rootstock would be carried out through
limited international tendering in view of their high specialization and only
a limited number of suitable supply sources. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that all procurement would be carried out as outlined in these
sections.
F. Disbursements
4.09    Disbursements are expected to extend over a period of about 4.25
years. Allowance has been made for possible delays in agroindustries civil
works as a result of the 1984 Winter Olympics. Construction for Popovo Polje
is not expected to be affected by these Winter Olympics, and disbursements
here are expected to be completed about a year earlier than for agroindustries
(3rd Quarter of FY85). This disbursement profile compares favorably with
accelerated historic project disbursement profiles for both Industry and
Agriculture in Yugoslavia which have average periods of 4.5 years and 6.0
years respectively. The forecast of Bank quarterly disbursements is shown in
Annex 1, Table 1 where the disbursement profiles for both Industry and
Agriculture in Yugoslavia are included for comparison. The more rapid
implementation forecast is due to two factors: (1) the more advanced stage of
procurement expected by the time of loan signature; and (2) the nature of the
investments, all of which have been defined and appraised, unlike other
projects in agriculture which are generally more credit oriented.

and civil works                           and 40% of local expenditures
2.  Popovo Polje                              100% of foreign expenditures and
a.  Overground irrigation, pumping        100% of local expenditures

establishment material including
trellising poles and wire and
fertilizer
4.10     Disbursements under Categories 1 anc 2 (a, b, and c) would be
supported by full documentation. Disbursements for Crop Establishment
Material in Category 2 (c) would be against PBS certified Statements of
Expenditure (SOE). Documentation supporting these statements would be
retained by PBS and made available to Bank supervision missions.
Disbursements under Category I would be subject to retroactive financing for
expenditures for equipment, made after December 31, 1981, up to a maximum of
US03.5 million for all such expenditures. Assurances that these disbursement
procedures would be followed were obtained during negotiations.
G. Accounts and Audit
4.11     PBS would maintain separate project accounts for subloan
disbursements and would ensure that the Social Accounting Service of
Yugoslavia (SDK) annually audit the accounts according to internationally
accepted standards and would submit such audited accounts to the Bank within 6
months of the close of each year. PBS would also undertake to have SDK submit
to the Bank, within 6 months of the close of each fiscal year, a separate
opinion as to whether or not the SOE supported withdrawals (para 4.10) have
been used for the correct purpose. PBS has complied with similar requirements
in the past and assurances were obtained during negotiations that these
accounting and auditing requirements would be followed and that the separate
project accounts would be made available by E'BS to Bank supervision missions.
H. Monitoring, Reporting and Evaluation
4.12     PBS would monitor project implementation through field supervision of
all subprojects and through appropriate periodic evaluation of key indicators
such as: establishment of qualified subproject implementation teams,



- 20 -
including those responsible for developing raw material supplies and marketing
outlets, procurement progress, physical and financial implementation of
construction, installation and start-up, training of required technical
personnel and development of full-production capacity, as well as commitments,
disbursements and repayments. In order to inform the Bank of overall progress
in project implementation in relation to targets, objectives and schedules
established for each investment, PBS would submit Semi-Annual Reports to the
Bank within 45 days of the close of each six-month period.
4.13     In its initial Semi-Annual Report PBS would include normative
schedules for each of these indicators and thereafter include comparative
schedules of actual versus expected performance for these indicators in each
Semi-Annual Report. In the Semi-Annual Report following the end of each
fiscal year PBS would report on the financial status of both the subprojects
and the investors and include the Balance Sheets and Income Statements of the
preceding year for each investor. PBS would prepare and send to the Bank a
Project Completion Report not later than 6 months after the project Closing
Date. PBS would prepare this report in accordance with an agreed format and
content guidelines. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that PBS
would carry out the above monitoring reporting and evaluation requirements.
To ensure adequate personnel input for this important task of subproject
monitoring and supervision and to assist the subborrowers in all aspects of
project implementation and startup, assurances were obtained during
negotiations that PBS would provide to the project not less than 4 manmonths
per year of supervision time, through personnel whose qualifications are
acceptable to the Bank. This may be supplied from suitable staff within PBS
or contracted under conditions acceptable to the Bank from a third party as
deemed necessary by the Bank.
V. PRODUCTION, MARKETS, PRICES AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Production and Cost Recovery
5.01     Production.  Due to the emphasis on replacement of existing food
processing plants and conservation of existing surplus production in
agroindustries and the rather small size (1,170 ha) of the Popovo Polje
irrigation component, incremental production from the project is quite small
relative to total output. In agroindustries incremental production would be
in vegetable oil and poultry only. This would amount to about 18,000 tons of
crude vegetable oil and 10 million broilers (1.6 kg/lw) annually. In Popovo
Polje annual incremental output would be as follows;
Tons
- Apples                                   8,640
- Table grapes                             2,000
- Rootstock ('000 cuttings)               12,075
- Maize                                    3,360
- Wheat                                      413
- Peppers                                    125
- Tomatoes                                   150
- Cucumbers                                  100
- Beans                                       55
- Wine grapes                              1,350



- 21 -
5.02     Cost Recovery.  PBS sub-loans for bol:h agroindustries and Popovo
Polje would be recovered through standard loan debt servicing. In contrast to
the conventional fashion, the irrigation scherne in Popovo Polje is a social
sector enterprise scheme rather than one financed from public revenues, thus
the O&M costs are internalized and treated in the same fashion as any
operating costs of a private firm.
B. Marketing
5.03     Agroindustries.  The major outputs o:' the various agroindustries are
wheat flour, crude vegetable oil, slaughtered and dressed poultry and pickled
and frozen vegetables. The flour mills and oil seed processing plants are
largely replacements of existing facilities, wzhile the main impact of the
facilities for pickling, freezing and storage of vegetables is to stabilize
the seasonal fluctuations in the supply of vegetables rather than to augment
total production. Hence, there are no marketing issues for these products.
Poultry slaughtering will have significant incremental impact and thus is
given more detailed treatment.
5.04     Poultry Meat.  Consumption of poultry meat, in both SFRY and SRBH,
has grown rapidly in the past decade. This has been the result of a rapid
increase in domestic production as trade in poultry meat is virtually
non-existent. Between 1975 and 1979 per capita consumption grew by over 10%
annually and appears to have been constrained principally by supply alone.
Despite this high growth rate, as shown in Table 5.1, consumption is still
below many countries in both Eastern and Western Europe.

Between 1975 and 1980 poultry production in SFRY grew at a rate of 7.75% p.a.
To meet the 1985 target required annual growth is only 5.1% p.a., thus the
target is quite feasible. The consumption projection is also seen as adequate
to clear the market. In the case of SRBH, even with constrained consumption,
supplies from other republics will have to be incieased in view of the low
production target. The target appears realistic and may even be optimistic in
view of the stagnation in output growth over the past 5 years. Thus the
increased output of poultry meat as a result of this investment is not likely
to lead to oversupply either in SFRY or SRBH.
5.05      Popovo Polje.  The incremental primary production from the Popovo
Polje Irrigation component will be marketed as fresh. The project area is
located near the Adriatic tourist resort area of Dubrovnik. The surrounding
region is a net importer of agricultural goods, due to the hilly nature and
the limited amounts of arable land. The selection of a cropping pattern is
based on the market prospects for the various technically feasible crops. The
production at full development, and its incremental impact on SFRY and SRBH
supply are presented below.

5.06      Production from this subproject will have a marginal impact on SFRY
production except for vine rootstock cuttings. Long-term export contracts for
vine graftings have resulted in a shortage of root cuttings.  The impact on
SRBH is significant for apples and grapes. Apples are currently purchased
from outside SRBH to meet processing storage arid marketing needs as are table
grapes. The variety of table grapes will be seedless, which is new to SFRY,
and is expected to command a marketing premium particularly among tourists.
For wine grapes, HEPOK, the parent organization of Popovo Polje W.O., has in
their local wineries sufficient capacity to handle all of the incremental
production. HEPOK is a large agricultural kombinat and has extensive
marketing facilities and will handle the majority of the production. Thus no
issues are seen in the distribution and marketing of the incremental
production.
C. Prices
5.07      At present, financial prices of basic: goods, which exclude fruit and
vegetables, are administered at the Federal Republic level.  Basically floor
prices are established for farmgate purchases while ceilings are set for
products at the consumer level. All are based on a cost-plus formula.
Farmgate prices can move above but not below the floor price, while consumer
prices can move below but not above the established ceilings. As a result
prices tend not to move independently of any moves in the floor and ceiling
prices. These latter are changed at irregular intervals based on changes in
the supply and demand conditions for the indivLdual products and in response
to aggregate (inflationary) demand and cost pressures. Inter-republican price
differentials are permitted but are minor, tak:Lng into account regional supply
and demand situations and transport costs. Contracted production for basic
commodities is done on the basis of a negotiated contract price known as an
agreed price. Production in excess of the cont:ract may be sold on the open
market. In practice farmgate prices are increasing faster than retail prices
which are closely monitored. This causes financial problems for
agroindustries. With respect to the project, this system applies to maize,
wheat, flour, oil seeds, vegetable oil and poultry meat. It excludes poultry
and fruit and vegetables. Since poultry production is now commercialized and
standardized the single administered price for poultry meat at the retail
level effectively sets all other poultry related prices. Prices for fruits
and vegetables are established entirely by market forces. Current financial
prices used in estimation of the financial rate of return are summarized in
Annex 2, Tables 3 and 4.
D.  Financial Analysis
5.08      The Financial Rates of Return (FRR) :or the aggregated
agroindustries component and for Popovo Polje are summarized in Table 5.1
below. Rates of return for the individual components together with extensive
sensitivity analyses and the associated cash f'Lows are contained in Annex 2,
Tables 1 and 2. When reviewing these it should be borne in mind that, in
SFRY, interest rates are assigned a rather minor role in allocation of
investment funds, the major role being carried out by the planning mechanism.
This permits societal as well as financial considerations to be taken into
account.

5.09      Agroindustries.  In view of the general issue of overcapacity in
food processing in SRBH and SFRY and the possibility of delay in construction
due to competition for construction capacity with the Winter Olympics, a
number of tests were performed to measure the sensitivity of the FRR. The
results are presented together with the base FRR, the more conventional
sensitivity tests, and also the main switching values. As seen the base rate
of return is above either the current blend on-lending rate (11.25%) or the
estimated opportunity cost of capital (12%). Effects of delays in
construction are tested by lagging the Benefits (B) and Operating Costs (C2)
by 1, 2 and 3 years. At most a I-year delay is expected and with this all
FRRs remain satisfactory. Capacity utilization is allowed to drop from 100%
1/ to 90% and 80% and at these levels all FRRs remain quite acceptable.
However, in the context of both sectoral and project investment planning it
should be noted that if capacity utilization declines below 80% the FRR for
most sub-project becomes marginal. This is extremely important in SFRY, where
capacity utilization for many food processing industries is already low
(Tables 2.5 and 2.6). Subproject screening and evaluation during preparation
and appraisal ensures that, as a risk, it is not significant for the specific
investments included in the project.
5.10      All sub-projects are seen to be very sensitive to changes in
benefits and operating costs and the switching values for these are quite
low. This is common in the food processing industry where gross margins are
characteristically low. In market economies the margins are maintained by
passing input or output price changes onto the consumer or back to the
producer as appropriate. In SFRY, where this is not always possible in the
short run, the authorities cover the shortfall through ad hoc subsidy
payments. This is part of a conscious policy of price stabilization by the
government.
5.11      Popovo Polje.  As seen in Table 5.1 the financial rates of return
for the Popovo Polje component for various scenarios are all quite
satisfactory. Testing for a delay of 1 year in implementation of the project
still leaves an FRR of 19%. The switching values for the cost and revenue
streams are also acceptable.
1/   Effective capacity utilization is assumed to be 100%, engineering
capacity utilization will probably be above this, giving possibly 90%
engineering capacity utilization at full development.

VI.  PROJECT BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Benefits and Distribution
6.01    The direct project benefits are the incremental output (para 5.01)
together with the value added through processing and storage of wheat, poultry
and vegetables. In addition, there are some pcsitive effects on employment.
The proceeds of the project would be distributed widely in accordance with the
universally accepted and legislated norms for remuneration of workers,
including payments of bonuses and social security funds. Payments to
producers are in accordance with contracted prices which are established prior
to signing production contracts. The foreign exchange impact is difficult to
assess, the main objective of the production being to maintain and increase
domestic consumption in the absense of which imports might or might not take
place given current import controls.
B. Employment Effects
6.02    In agroindustries at full development, the project investments would
result in 306 additional full-time jobs and continuation of 238 existing
full-time jobs. In financial terms the total capital cost per job created or
restored comes to about US$83,000. In economic terms the capital cost is
US$46,000 per job. These high costs are to be expected in agroindustries.
The choice of capital intensive technology is induced by factor prices
prevailing in Yugoslavia. Despite reports of presence of unemployment and
under-employment, the price of labor ia relatively high compared with
capital. In economic analysis factor and product market distortions are
corrected by use of shadow prices of labor and use of a more appropriate
opportunity cost of capital. This has been done for the present project and
results show that the investments are quite satisfactory. A more
comprehensive approach requires evaluation of alternative technologies
differing in relative factor intensities and selection of the least-cost



- 26 -
technology by use of appropriate factor prices. In that case, if labor is the
more abundant factor, the efficiency analysis would automatically ensure
choice of a more labor intensive technology and employment effects would be
built into project analysis. However, for the processing plants involved here
the labor content of the available technological variations is not great
except at the extreme ends of the technological spectrum. Consequently the
more comprehensive analytical approach is not likely to yield a significantly
greater job creating solution, i.e. one with at least 5% more jobs created.
Thus, the cost per job created would not greatly change.
6.03    In Popovo Polje the incremental employment impact would be relatively
greater than in agroindustries. About 200 full-time employees would be
required for both on-farm and irrigation operations, while about 55 man-years
of seasonal labor would be required principally for harvesting. The cost per
job (man-year of employment) created in financial terms is US$43,000 and in
economic terms is USt28,000. Again these costs appear high. In this case
also factor and product market price distortions were adjusted for through the
use of specific and general conversion factors. The project was still
viable. The technology incorporated in the analysis is quite labor intensive
and it is difficult to conceive of more labor intensive technologies given the
prevailing financial prices of labor.
C. Economic Analysis
6.04    With the exception of some construction costs, and all labor and
internal transportation costs, all inputs and outputs are priced as tradeables
based on their border equivalent values with adjustment for quality
differentials and transportation as appropriate. Changes in international
input and output prices, as forecast by the Bank's Commodities and Export
Projection's Division, are incorporated over time. For Popovo Polje, due to a
complete and basic change in design concept during appraisal, construction
costs could not be disaggregated. The basic construction, labor and internal
transportation costs used are those presently prevailing in SRBH. To convert
these financial prices to economic values conversion factors specific to each
are used. Construction costs for agroindustries are decomposed into two
tradeable components, direct and indirect foreign exchange and two
non-tradeable components, domestic materials and labor. The tradeable
components were priced at border prices, a standard conversion factor (0.7)
was applied to the domestic materials component together with a labor
conversion factor (0.4) for the labor component. Actual prices used are
presented in Annex 3, Tables 4 and 5.
6.05    All direct economic benefits and costs have been quantified and the
resulting internal rates of return for the aggregated agroindustries
component, Popovo Polje and the project are summarized in Table 6.1 below.
Detailed results and the associated cash flows for all subprojects and for the
total project are given in Annex 3, Tables 1, 2 and 3.

6.06    The rate of return to the overall project is 27% with a 30% rate of
return to the agroindustries component (80% of the investment cost of the
project) and 16% to the Popovo Polje irrigation component (20% of the
investment cost). The agroindustries component is seen, from the switching
values and sensitivity tests, to be very sensitive to changes in revenues and
operating costs. As explained in discussing the financial analysis results
(para 5.10) this is classical but rarely presents problems. In contrast
Popovo Polje is not very sensitive to such changes. The agroindustries
component, accounting for 93% of the project's present value, dominates the
project; consequently the overall project rate of return is also seen to be
sensitive to changes in revenues and operating costs. The base ERRs for the
individual agroindustry sub-projects range from 17 to 50%. Overall and
individual economic rates of return are substantially higher than financial
rates of return for almost all of the agroindustry subprojects. This results
from the current domestic pricing system, in which factorygate prices
(consumer prices) are relatively highly controlled while raw material prices
are permitted more flexibility.
6.07    Tests were also carried out on the ERRs with respect to their
sensitivity to delays in implementation, togethler with changes in conversion
factors (standard or general, labor and transpartation) and to changes in
capacity utilization. These tests reflect real risks which might arise in the
lifetime of the project. With respect to delays the project and all
su'b-projects are quite robust. An extreme delay of 3 years between investment
and the start of operations is required to have a serious impact and even then



- 28 -
only one sub-project ERR falls below 12%. The project and its components
remain virtually unaffected by changes in the aggregate conversion factors.
Sensitivity tests for the Popovo Polje component with respect to the
transportation conversion factor and capacity utilization were omitted;
transport is of little or no significance in its cost structure and capacity
utilization is not relevant. Tbe agroindustries component and its
sub-projects are sensitive to capacity utilization but, for individual
sub-projects, this has to drop to 20-50% before the ERRs fall below 12%.
While this is of significance to republican and federal investment planners,
the specific industries concerned have generally high rates of utilization
(Tables 2.5 and 2.6) and consequently this is not seen to be a risk for the
project.
D. Risks
6.08    Overall the project appears quite satisfactory.  With the sharp focus,
during preparation and appraisal, on the question of capacity utilization and
the exclusion of sub-projects in food processing activities where such
utilization is low, the risk of project failure has been much reduced. The
viability of the Popovo Polje irrigation component was enhanced during
preparation and appraisal through altering the proposed design of the
irrigation system to a substantially lower cost system and redesigning the
proposed cropping pattern. The assumptions on full development yields and the
time taken to reach these are set out in Table 6.2 below. Build-up is
somewhat slower than for similar on-going projects in Yugoslavia. This was
deliberate in view of the lack of tradition of growing many of these crops in
the project area.

6.09     Project procurement is at an advanced stage.  This has been required
by the Bank in order to minimize implementation delays and cost overruns which
have been occurring recently in SFRY as a result of high domestic inflation
and counter inflationary measures. All technology in the project, although
new to some investors, is already in existence within SFRY and so may be
viewed in operation. All agroindustries anticipate using coal as the source
of plant energy requirements for steam and heat. Consequently the major risk
is confined to management of the individual sub-projects and the overall
project; particularly the quality and efficiency of management with respect to
procurement, construction and start-up. In this respect PBS supervision of
the sub-projects (para 4.13) will be of importance.
VII. RECOMMENDAT'[ONS
7.01     During negotiations the following assurances were obtained, that:
(i)    in case of significant change in any subproject or new subproject,
PBS would carry out and send to the Bank for its approval a full
technical and economic subproject appraisal report in accordance with
a format agreed upon at negotiations and prior to any reimbursement
for the subproject concerned (para 4.04);
(ii)    PBS would charge an interest rate of not less than 15% annually for
all domestic commercial bank funds. Interest rates for Governmental
development investment funds shall reflect the full charges
prevailing when the subloan agreement is concluded. Interest on Bank
funds will be 11.6% p.a. plus a 1.25% on lending charge. For all
subprojects PBS would determine the length of each subloan, including
grace and repayment periods, from the cash flow analysis of each
investment. Unless otherwise agreed the subloan repayment period
would be not more than 15 years including not more than 5 years grace
and PBS would take adequate steps to protect itself against the
exchange risks on its lending and borrowing operations, including
these subloans (para 4.05);
(iii)    agroindustries equipment would be procured through ICB, and pumping
station and over-ground irrigation equipment, fruit tree and vineyard
rootstock material through limited international tendering, both in
accordance with Bank Procurement Guidelines. Agroindustries civil
works and Popovo Polje on-farm machinery and equipment will be
procured through local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to
the Bank. On-farm machinery and equipment would be procured in 3
packages. Popovo Polje on-farm buildings and other miscellaneous
items would be procured through local shopping procedures acceptable
to the Bank (paras 4.06-4.08);
(iv)    all disbursements for agroindustries and Popovo Polje components
described in para 4.10 would be supported by full documentation,
except for miscellaneous items, including trellising poles and wire
and fertilizer, which would be against PBS certified Statements of
Expenditure. Documentation supporting these statements would be
retained by PBS and made available to Bank supervision missions (para
4.11);



- 30 -
(v)    PBS would maintain separate project accounts for subloan
disbursements, which would be audited annually by SDK, and submitted
to the Bank within 6 months of the close of each year. PBS would
also have SDK submit to the Bank, within 6 months of the close of
each fiscal year, a separate opinion as to whether or not
disbursements under the Statements of Expenditure have been used for
the correct purposes. These project accounts would be made available
by PBS to Bank supervision missions (para 4.11); and
(vi)    PBS would monitor project implementation and submit Semi-Annual
Reports to the Bank within 45 days of the close of each six-month
period. In the Semi-Annual Report following the end of each fiscal
year, PBS would report on the financial status of the sub-projects
and the investor and include audited Balance Sheets and Income
Statements of the preceding year for each investor. PBS would send
to the Bank a Project Completion Report not later than 6 months after
the Closing Date. To ensure adequate personnel input, PBS from its
own staff or through consultants, would provide to the project not
less than 4 man-months per year of supervision time on conditions and
of a quality acceptable to the Bank (paras 4.12 and 4.13).
7.02     With the above assurances and conditions the project constitutes a
suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$35 million equivalent to PBS for a term
of 15 years including 3 years grace.

and methodology used in deriving those projections are discussed in the Working Paper.
/   Internal transport cost added to border price for import parity items and deducted from border price for export parity items to derive ex-factory/farm  price.
Port handling charges are added to border price for import parity items and deducted from border price for export parity items to derive ex-factory/farm  price.
Port handling charges and internal transport cost are modified by transport conversion factor (0.6) and SF (0.7) respectively prior to derivation of ex-factory/ex-farm  price.                      ,

Popovo Polje Irrigation Component.
A. Status of Des;ign
4.01     In the preliminary design submitted to the Bank, irrigation in the
social sector had been proposed by a solid sprinkler system and booms,
subsequently replaced by typhoons. The individual sector was proposed to be
served by quick-coupling sprinkler pipes. During appraisal, the furrow and
basin irrigation was also proposed. The consideration of furrow irrigation
was prompted by the high cost of the solid anc other sprinkler systems. Final
design of the system is now based on sprinkler irrigation.
B. Water Requirements and Availability
4.02     Water Requirements.  Net water requirements for project crops were
estimated at 2,904 ma/ha; the highest net demand of 1,191 m3/ha would
occur in July and the next highest 6,763 m3/ha in June. The overall system
efficiency has been computed at 80%. Gross water requirements at source would
be 3,600 m3/ha, which would amount to a total of 4.2 million m3 during the
cropping season. The total demand would be met from the Trebisnijca River.
4.03     Water Availability.  The flows of the Trebisnijca River, above the
proposed irrigation project, are stored in Grancarevo and Gorica reservoirs
and are used for power generation in three separate hydropower stations. A
fourth hydropower station, namely Caplina, has become recently operative,
below the proposed irrigation project. The operation of Caplina power plant
is dependent on the canalized flows of the karst estavals in the Popovo Polje
flood plain and on the releases of surplus flows (about 19 m3/sec) from the
upstream dams. During summer, particularly July and August, the karst
estavals and consequently the Trebisnijca River is dry and all supplies have
to be released from Gorica dam for production of power at Caplina.
Considering the priority given to agriculture in SR Bosnia-Herzegovina, the
Government has decided to allocate 2.0 m3/sec during this phase and 5.0
m3/sec during a second phase, to the Popovo Polje irrigation project.
Assurances would be sought during negotiations that the priority needs of
irrigation in the project area would be respected. In calculating the ERR,
the net incremental benefits will be reduced by an amount equivalent to the
opportunity of cost of power which has been foregone.

C.  Cost Estimates                        Page 2
4.04     The total project cost including physical and price contingencies,
but excluding interest during construction, is estimated at Din 195.67 million
(US$4.48 million). The foreign exchange component, which includes both direct
and indirect foreign costs, is estimated at US$2.06 million or 46% of the
total cost. The base cost estimates are based on unit rates of work that are
expected to prevail in Yugoslavia by mid 1982. Price contingencies for
foreign expenditure have been assumed at 5% in 1982 and 10% thereafter and
compounded over 1982, 1983 and 1984. Price contingencies for local
expenditure have been assumed at 17.5% (1982), 25% (1983), 20% (1984) and 20%
(1985) and compounded. Project cost estimate is summarized in the following
