PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA
BOSNTA-HERZEGOVINA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (Loan 2136-YU)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Bosnia-
Herzegovina Agricultural Development Project, for which Loan 2136-YU in the
amount of US$35.0 million was approved on May 4, 1982. US$20.1 million of
the loan was utilized and the remaining US$14.9 million was cancelled. The
loan was closed on March 31, 1988, one year after the planned date. The
last disbursement took place on May 11, 1988.
The PCR was prepared by the Agriculture Operations Division,
Country Department IV, Europe, Middle East and North Africa Regional
Office. Part I is based on a completion report prepared by the borrower,
the Staff Appraisal Report, the Presiient's Report, the Loan Agreement,
correspondence with the borrower, internal Bank memoranda, and interview
wit.h Bank officials. Part II was prepared on the basis of the borrower's
report.  The entire  PCR was  sent  to  the borrower for comment, and the
borrower's response is  attached  as  an  annex.    The  comments have been
addressed in the text or in footnotes.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA
BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (Loan 2136-YU)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
The project was intended to replace/modernize or establish agro-
industrial plants as warranted by market demand and raw material supply,
from a countrywide perspective. It was also intended to provide
agricultural development in the poverty pocket of Popovo Polje, by
introducing an irrigation system covering both social and individual sector
farms (paras. 1, 2).
Implementation Experience
Despite difficult macro-economic circumstances the agro-industrial
sub-projects were implemented essentially on time (one of the six sub-
projects experienced a delay of a year), with substantial loan savings due
to the deletion of one sub-project, design changes, real depreciation of
the exchange rate, and delays in withdrawal. Implementation problems for
this component centered on procurement (especially the observation of Bank
guidelines) and some design changes (paras. 6-8).
The social sector irrigation was completed in a timely fashion on
a somewhat reduced scale (721 of 900 planned ha), but the 270 ha of private
smallholder irrigation was abandoned due to difficulties in land
consolidation (para. 12).
Results
Aaro-industrv. High capacity utilization rates were achieved in
two of the five plants in 1986 and 1987. Poor weather adversely affected
raw material supply for another plant, a fourth plant had significant
management problems, and the fifth plant was in the start-up period.
Nevertheless, the Borrower re-estimated the FRRs sor these sub-projects in
the 16-19S range (versus 16-27Z in the SAR) (pa.as  18, 19 and 23).
Irrigation component.  The Popovo Polje isrigation system began
operatiou. in mid-1984, and the performance through 1988 was reported to be
satisfactory, although the cropping pattern appropriate to current
conditions was still being sought. Thus only 83X of the area was under
cultivation in 1987, and 10OZ cropping intensity will not be achieved until
1991.  Furthermore, a shift from field crops to wine grapes on part of the
area is being undertaken, perhaps in response to changing relative prices.



- iiA -
The Borrower re-eostmated the FRR at 191 (versus 221 in the SAR) (paras. 22
and 24).
Sustainabilitv
Sustainability depends on the country's success in Improving
macro-economic conditions. A specific problem for some of the
agroindustrIes Is price control, and the extent to which input and output
prices are adjusted to provide a reasonable margin for processors. Three
of the four enterprises were considered to have geod management and may be
able to strengthen their financial and marketing capabilities sufficiently
to compete reasonably well with other Yugoslavian agroindustries, provided
tho macro-economic conditions allow them to exist. The fourth enterprise
(vegetable processing) may have more difficulties unless the macro-economic
environment Improves substantially and the enterprise is borne along on the
tide. The irrigation scheme appears to be viable over the longer term,
since the cropping pattern probably can be adjusted to accommodate changes
in price relationships (par&. 26).
Lessons
The project highlights the difficulty of implementing projects in
the context of deterforating macro-economic .-onditions and a reform process
resulting in drastically-changing price signals. This calls for adjusting
the composition of the lending program and greater flexibility in project
design (paras. 27-28).
To avoid problems with procurement in future projects, standard
documents should be agreed with the borrower prior to Board presentation
(par&. 29).

PROJECT CUMPLETION REPORT
PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
Project Identity
Project Name:     Bosnia-Herzegovina Agricultural Development Project
Loan No.:         2136-YU
RVP Unit:         Europe, Middle East and North Africa Region
Country:          Yugoslavia
Sector:           Agriculture
Subsectors:       Agroindustry, Irrigation
Background
1.          At the time of project formulacion, in 1980 and 1981, Yugoslavia's
agricultural development strategy was to promote the growth of social sector
agriculture through the vertically-integrated agro-kombinats, as the principal
means to achieve large-scale market production and self-sufficiency in food.
Individual sector development was sought through long-term association of
individual farmers with the agro-kombinats. Within this strategy, emphasis was
given to promoting the development of low-income areas. The Bank's strategy was
to support the development of primary production in the individual sector, in
recognition of that sector's contribution to production and potential for growth,
expansion of agroindustrial capacity in the social sector to process farm output,
and achievement of a more equitable income distribution.   The project was
intended to replace/modernize worn-out agroindustrial plants and establish new
plants as warranted from a countrywide   perspective, and to raise primary
production through irrigation in the poverty pocket of Popovo Polje.
Objectives and Description
2.          As indicated above, the objectives of the project were to modernize
and expand agroindustrial capacity as justified on the basis of market demand
and raw material supply (seen from a countrywide viewpoint), and to promote
agricultural development in a low-income area by introducing an irrigation system
covering both social and individual sector farms. The project consisted of six
agroindustry subprojects [two flour mills (replacement), a poultry slaughterhouse
(new), a vegetable oil plant (replacement), a vegetable pickling plant (new),
and a vegetable freezing and cold storage plant (new)] and a sprinkler irrigation
scheme at Popovo Polje covering an area of about 1170 &a, of which 900 ha would
be in the social sector and 270 ha in the individual sector.   The cropping
pattern of the irrigated area was expected to feature orchards, vineyards,
cereals such as maize, and vegetables.
Design and Organization
3.          A cinsiderable effort was made during preparation and appraisal to
formulate a project which would fit within the development strategy of the sector



2
and the Bank's assistance strategy.  In agroindusLry, it was recognized that
fragmented investment policy had resulted in the construction of excess capacity
for some products, and emphasis was placed on selecting subprojects which were
justified within a countrywide investment perspective. Of the eleven subprojects
which were initially proposed, only three were eventually included in the
project. In order to avoid the procurement problems which had plagued other
projects in Yugosl3vis and expedite implementation in general, the loan was
approved only after bid evaluation for the equipment had been completed.
Privedna Banka Sarajevo (PBS) had been involved in previous agricultutral and
industrial credit projects, and a previous agrictlture and agroindustry project,
and was considered fully capable of implementing this project.   For the
irrigation scheme, several options were considered before settling on the
proposed sprinkler system as the least-cost, most flexible design. Emphasis was
placed on achieving substantial individual sector participation in the irrigation
component.
Implementation
4.          The  project  was  carried  out  under  difficult  macro-economic
conditions,  which  deteriorated  substantially  over  the  course  of  the
implementation period from 1982 to the beginning of 1988 and affected botn the
investment and operating phases of the subprojects.   GDP and exports were
virtually stagnant in real terms, and real wages declined. Jn contrast, activity
was dramatic in the monetary variables, as money supply rose about ten and a half
times over the period and inflation accelerated from 32% in 1982 to 121% in 1987.
Real interest rates became increasingly negative but varied erratically as
nominal rates were increased in spurts. Nominal depreciation of the dinar/dollar
exchange rate increased from 44% in 1982 to 94% in 1987, and some real
depreciation occurred over the course of implementation. In general, the economy
was characterized by growing volatility and uncertainty. It is surprising that
the project enterprises proceeded with their investments udder these conditions,
but perhaps they were shielded by continuing subsidies from the growing influence
of market forces.
5.          Physical implementation of the agroindustrial sub_rolects proceeded
relatively well, in general, although there were procurement and financing
difficulties.   (See below.)  Four of the five final subprojects (flour mill,
poultry slaughterhouse, vegetable pickling plant, and vegetable freezing/storage
plant) were completed by mid-1986, and the fifth (vegetable oil plant) was
completed in early 1988. The subprojects were all implemented by constituent
work organizations of two large, experienced agrokombinats: PTK Tuzla (flour
mill and vegetable processing) and PK Brcko (poultry slaughterhouse and vegetable
oil). These organizations were considered to be well-managed and had a history
of profitable operations, except for RO Hranaprodukt (vegetable processing),
which had not been involved in the business previously.
6.          Four of the six proposed subprojects were approved by PBS in June
1982, while action on the remaining two (the second flour mill and vegetable
oil) was postponed because of investor difficulties in providing their equity



3
contributions.1 Various equipment contracts should have become effective by
August 1982, but the Bank loan did not become effective until November 1982,
and PBS could not approve subloans prior to loan effectiveness.   Changes in
subproject design and further problems with procurement caused additional delays.
Processing by PBS of financing for cost increases due to inflation was arduous
and alsa caused delays.   The result of these various factors was that the
initiation of subprojects was postponed substantially, in spite of the efforts
made at preparation ard appraisal to ensure that the project was well-advanced
by the time of loan appreval.
7.          Some of the delays occurred because the work organizations were
indecisive and kept changing the nature and scope of their investment proposals.
This was one of the factors contributing to the procurement problems which
plagued the second flour mill (Modrica). In the case of the vegetable oil plant,
design change caused a substantial delay in implemen.ation and a postponement
of the loan closing date by one year. Part of the problem may have been the
focus of the enterprises on production and their lick of appreciation of the
marketing and financial implications of design chanhas.
8.          There were considerable problems with procurement, as in the case
of most agroindustry investments in Yugoslavia. As noted above, some problems
with equipment contracts were caused by the delay in effectiveness of tlhe loan
and design changes. However, the main problem seems to have been the failure
to comply with Bank requirements, in spite of the considerable efforts made by
the Bank to familiarize the local authorities with these requirements.2 In some
cases (e.g. Modrica flour mill), contract awards were made without consulting
the Bank.   In others (e.g. vegetable oil), contracts were signed which were
significantly different from those approved by the Bank. And in various cases,
there were deficiencies in draft contracts which often required several rounds
of discussions and considerable time and effort to resolve. The procurement
difficulties for tehe Modrica flour mill were so great that PBS finally requested
that the investmen: be eliminated from the project, and $ 2.9 million of the Bank
loan was cancelled.
9.          The financial difficulties resulted essentially from the inflationary
environment. In some cases, the investors had difficulty providing the equity
contributions.   (And none provided the 20X contribution proposed for the
PBS asserts that difficulty with the equity contribution caused ^ delay
in construction only of the vegetable plant (Annex, para 1). However, the
approval of both the vegetable oil and second flour mill subprojtcts was
affected by this issue.
2PBS suggests that the 'complexity, slow realization and even inconsistency"
in application of the guidelines by the Bank contributed to the procurement
difficulties (Annex, para 2). However, in the Bank's view, the problem
was not in the Bank's response but in the failure of the implementing
agencies to follow the guidelines.



4
project.3)  In virtually all cases, delays resulted from the processing cf
supplemental subloan applications to cover cost "overruns.' (Since the subloan
price contingencies were very low in relation to inflation, PBS had to approve
supplemental subloans to cover the difference.)
10.         The interest rate ci subloans was of growing concern during the
imr-'mentation period because of the increasingly negative real rates and the
impact of rising nominal rates on subborrowers and intermediaries. Particular
attention was given to interest rates under the Structural Adjustment Loan of
1983, which set out a process for achieving positive real rates (including the
ratas under ongoing projects), but application of the agreed formula continued
to be a problem during the project period.4
11.         At various points during project implementation, the investor? and
PBS urged the Bank to approve the use of surplus loan funds to finance additional
investments within the existing subprojects or new subprojects, but none of the
proposals was  demonstrated  to be viable.    In some  cases,  such  as  the
confectionery products line for the Liubaca flour mill, the proposed products
were outside the scope of the business, and the enterprise was unable to present
a sound marketing plan and indicate how a satisfactory return on investment would
be expected.   In the case of the meat processing lire for the Brcko poultry
slaughterhouse, the Bank felt that existing facilities were adequate to meet the
demand. And in other cases, such as the margarine line for the Brcko vegetable
oil plant and the sweet corn line for the Bosanski Samac vegetable processing
plant, there were questions about the availability of raw material, and the
enterprises again could not demonstrate the possibility of a satisf&ctory return
on investment.
12.         The  P,povo  Polje  irrigation  component  was  to  involve  the
establishment n    sprinkler irrigation system on about 1170 ha, of which 900
ha would be ix '.n social sector and the remaining 270 ha in the individual
sector. It was expected that the area in the social sector would be cultivated
primarily for apples, table grapes, vine rootstocks, and maize, while cultivation
in the individual sector would focus on wine grapes, maize, and vegetables.
However, the individual sector part of the system was eliminated because land
consolidation could not be implemented. According to the borrower completion
report (BCR), the farmers objected to the consolidation and could not bear the
financial obligations resulting from consolidation and establishment of the
irrigation system. The area for the social sector was reduced from 900 ha to
721 ha because of the construction of runoff channels, the presence of
underground rocks, and what the BCR terms "property relations." An experimental
drainage plot was dropped because, according to the BCR, "the investor reasonably
chose a less costly and more efficient solution." Construction of the reduced
system for the social sector proceeded very well and was completed in mid-1984,
3PBS notes that the Loan Agreement provided for lower equity contributions
if the financial condition of investors so warranted (An-nex, para 1).
4PBS maintains that the SAL arrangement was not applicable to this project
because it was introduced after the signing of the project's Loan Agreement
(Annex, para 3).



5
in time to provide irrigation for that season.  Although the actual investment
cost exceeded the estimate (see below), there were surplus Bank funds because
of real depreciation of the exchtinge rate and the delays in withdrawals
(resulting in a substantial increase in the exchange rate between the date of
expenditure and the date of withdrawal). The investor requested that these funds
be used to finance a cold store, but the Bank did not approve the proposal
because of excess cold storage capacity in the vicinity, overly optimistic
projection of exports, and inadequate financial rate of return.
13.         Cost.  Only a rough estimate of the dollar equivalent of project
cost can be prepared because the BCR does not provide adequate information for
conversion of the dinar cost figures.5   The total cost of the project was
approximately $ 44 million equivalent, or 56X of the cost of $ 79 million
estimated at appraisal (excluding incremental working capital) (Table 4). The
cost of the agroindustries component was roughly $ 32 million, in comparison
with the $ 66 million estimated at appraisal, because of the elimination of the
Modrica flour mill, modifications in design, lower costs than estimated in some
cases, and real depreciation of the exchange rate.6 The cost of the irrigation
component was about $ 12 million, in comparison with the appraisal estimate of
$ 13 million, in spite of the elimination of the individual sector part of the
scheme and the reduction in the size of the social sector portion.7
14.         Financing.    The structure of financing was  also considerably
different from the expectations at appraisal (Table 5). Investors were unable
to meet their required contributions and provided only 121 of the funds, rather
than the 202 expected at appraisal. PBS and other banks provided only 151 of
the funds, as a result of liquidity constraints and the availability of lower-
cost federal and republic funds.   The latter amounted to 28X of financing
requirements, and thus the total debt financing from local sources of 43Z was
significantly higher than the appra:sal expectation of 38%, compensating for the
shortfalls in contributions by the investors. The proportion of funds provided
by the Bank of 452 was somewhat higher than the 422 projected at appraisal and
also compensated in part for the shortfalls in investor contributions.   The
disbursement percentage was increased during implementation because of the real
depreciation of the exchange rate. Only $ 20.1 million (572) of the Bank loan
of $ 35 million was utilized because of changes in the project scope and cost,
real depreciation of the exchange rate, and delays in withdrawal.
5The BCR does not provide any phasing of investment costs, which are given
in dinars. Therefore, estimates of dollar equivalents have been prepared
on the basis of the exchange rates existing during the respective
implementation periods.
6PBS claims that the primary reason for the lower cost is that the appraisal
estimates were too high (Annex, para 5). However, in the Bank's view, the
estimates were reasonable, given the original designs.
7PBS estimates the cost of the irrigation component at $ 7 million, but it
uses the exchange rate at the time of withdrawal rather than at the time
of investment expenditure (Annex, para 4).

Results
15.         Whether the project objectives of expanding agroindustrial capacity
on a viable basis and promoting the development of a low-income area will be
achieved in the longer term is not clear, although the prospects seem brighter
at present for the irrigation component than for the agroindustries.
16.         A-roindustries  Component.      The  deteriorating  macro-economic
conditions exposed glaring weaknesses in Yugoslavia's fragmented economy, and
agroindustries had difficulty in coping. The traditional focus on maximizing
output without sufficient attention to cost considerations left enterprises ill-
prepared to market products in the face of declining demand and to manage their
financial operations in the context of accelerating inflation, erratically-rising
nominal interest rates, and climbing exchange rates (affecting prices of imported
equipment and debt service on loans denominated in foreign currency). T'hus it
is no surprise that the project agroindustries had problems operating in this
environment.
17.         Three of the four implementing organizations were considered to be
well-managed enterprises with established local markets and a history of
profitable operations. Nevertheless, they were not prepared for operation under
conditions of growing inflation and competition, and their deficiencies in
financial management and marketing became evident during the operational phase.
Their flexibility was particularly restricted by controlled prices on some of
their products. The fourth organization (RO Hranaprodukt, vegetable processing)
was even more vulnerable, since it had no previous experience.
18.         The BCR reports high capacity utilization rates in 1986 and 1987
for the Ljubaca flour mill and Brcko poultry slaughterhouse, and indicates that
the financial results were "positive" but below projections. It attributes the
inadequate results to controlled output prices and criticizes the Bank for
refusing to finance proposed additional lines for products with uncontrolled
prices.   Financial rates of return (FRRs) presented in the BCR for the two
subprojects are satisfactory, although a communication from PBS at the end of
1988 indicates that they are likely to be lower (see below). Brcko vegetable
oil plant was in trial operation at the time that the BCR was prepared, and no
FRR was estimaLed. The report indicates that it is expected to be below the
appraisal estimate, again because of controlled prices.
19.         No capacity utilization rates are given in the BCR for the Bosanski
Samac vegetable pickling and freezing/cold storage subprojects, but output was
said to be below projections because of the impact of poor weather on raw
material supply and marketing problems at home and abroad.   The "business
results" are characterized as "positive," although only "modest" performance is
expected over the medium term as a consequence of marketing difficulties due to
high inflation and the reduced purchasing power of consumers. Bank supervision
reports cite factors such as the lack of previous experience in the business;
the preoccupation with investment implementation to the detriment of operational
planning; the weak financial structure resulting from the low equity contribution
and consequent high debt service burden; and deficiencies in raw material
management, marketing, and financial management. The FRR calculated for the BCR



7
is somewhat higher than the appraisal estiritates, but a current estimate probably
would be lower.
20.         The management problems being encountered by RO Hranaprodukt were
recognized at an early stage, and it was also recognized that other work
organizations were having some difficulties in areas such as raw material supply,
marketing, management information, and financial management. Consequently, the
Bank in 1984 suggested the establishment of a management improvement program.
A team was to be formed by PTK Tuzla, PK Brcko, and AIPK Banja Luka to review
the management systems in their various constituent organizations and propose
systems to be established in the agroindustrial enterprises. In view of the
deficiencies at RO Hanaprodukt, the Bank recommended that the team's proposals
be introduced first in this work organization. Although the initial response
to the Bank's suggestions was positive, the suggestions were not implemented.
Perhaps they were overtaken by events, since the Bank subsequently participated
in a review of agroindustry under the Bosanska Krajina Agriculture and
Agroindustries Project (Loan 1621-YU), the results of which were to be utilized
for strengthening other agroindustries, as well. Unfortunately, this program
was not implemented, although PBS notes that it assisted AIPK Bosanska Krajina
with a "financial consolidation."  In any case, it will be important for future
projects to include measures for enhancing the capability of agroindustry
management to perform satisfactorily undet conditions of inflation and growing
competition.
21.         Increasing emphasis was placed on financial management of enterprises
over the course of project implementation, and work organizations were urged to
make financial projections in both constant and current terms in order to attempt
to adjust to accelerating inflation, depreciation of the dinar, and rising
nominal interest rates. PBS did not support these efforts because it felt that
it was difficult to prepare such projections.8 Future projects should ensure
that participating enterprises develop an adequate capability in financial
management, particularly with respect to aspects such as financial planning
(especially cash flow planning), pricing policy, and cost accounting.
22.         Irrigation ComRonent.   The Popovo Polje irrigation system began
operation in mid-1984, and the performance through 1988 was reported to be
satisfactory, although the cropping pattern appropriate to current conditions
was still being sought.  Thus only 83% of the area was under cultivation in
1987, and 100% cropping intensity will not be achieved until 1991. Furthermore,
a shift from field crops to wine grapes on part of the area is being undertaken,
perhaps in response to changing relative prices.
23.         Financial Rates of Return (FRRs).  The BCR presents estimated FRRs
for the agroindustry subprojects of 16-19%, in comparison with appraisal
estimates of 16-27%, yet indicates that some investors were having difficulty
servicing their debt and that some subloans might have to be rescheduled.
Assuming that the FRRs were calculated correctly (no data 're given in the BCR),
they may be based on optimistic urojections or other operations of the investors
8PBS notes that it has undertaken substantial efforts to assist in the
"consolidation and rehabilitation" of investors (Annex, para 7).

may be draining funds from the subprojects. In a communication at the end of
1988, PBS indicated that the FRRs are likely to be lower than the BCR estimates,
because of the further deterioration in macro-economic conditions, but it did
not provide revised estimates. The question of financial viability seems to rest
primarily with the macro-economic environment, since the plants apparently are
well-placed to meet market demand for quality products over the longer term, and
the managements are experienced (except in the case of vegetable processing) and
considered capable. Further strengthening of the marketing and financial aspects
of the operations seems to be needed but should be feasible in most case
Whether the macro-economic conditions, and in particular pricing policy, w, i
allow the enterprises to operate with a satisfactory margin between input prices
and output prices is uncertain.
24.         For the Popovo Polje irrigation system, the BCR estimates the FRR
at 19%, in comparison with the appraisal estimate of 22%, in spite of the
considerable increase in unit cost.   In its most recent communication, ?BS
suggested that the financial performance continues to be satisfactory.
25.         Economic Rates of Return (ERRs).  The BCR does not indicate any
ERRs, nor does it provide input data for the FRRs which would allow estimates
of ERRs to be prepared9.   The average FRR presented in the BCR for the
agroindustry and irrigation components is approximately 18X, compared to an
average of about 19% estimated at appraisal.   The average ERR estimated at
appraisel was about 271.  If the relationship between FRRs and ERRs were the
same as at appraisal, a current average estimate of the ERR would be
approximately 261. Since there has been a further deterioration in the economic
environment since the BCR was prepared, and since there may have been changes
in the relationship between FRRs and ERRs, a very rough estimate of the ERR for
the project might be 13%. The margin of error in this estimate is, of course,
very high.
Sustainabilitv
26.         As  indicated above,  the prospects  for the agroiridustries are
uncertain. Much depends on the country's success in improving macrc-economic
conditions. A specific problem for some of the agroindustries is price control,
and the extent to which input and output prices are adjusted to provide a
reasonable margin for processors.  Three of the four enterprises were .considered
to have good management and may be able to strengthen their financial and
marketing capabilities sufficiently to compete reasonably well with other
Yugoslavian agroindustries, provided the macro-economic conditions allow them
to exist. The fourth enterprise (vegetable processing) may have more difficulties
unless the macro-economic environment improves substantially and the enterprise
is borne along on the tide. The irrigation scheme appears to be viable over the
longer term, since the cropping pattern probably can be adjusted to accommodate
changes in price relationships.
9PBS was asked to provide these data but did not comply with the request.

Bank Performance
27.         Prrject implementation under deteriorating economic conditions and
partial reforms was difficult for all concerned.  Efforts were made during
preparation dnd appraisal to include investments which would be viable in the
long run, and some changes were made during implementation in response to
changing circumstances. However, much greater flexibility is probably necessary
to implement a lending program under coiditions such as those which existed in
Yugoslavia during the period of this project. Now that the impact of the partial
reforms is evident, the Bank may be able to adjust its assistance strategy
accordingly. One approach might be to vary the type of operation according to
the phase of the reform process. When reforms are being introduced, conditions
are highly volatile and uncertain, and farmers/enterprises are (or should be)
reluctant to invest, perhaps the Bank should emphasize operations oriented toward
policy reform and institutional development. When the course of reform and its
consequences are clearer, the Bank might shift the emphasis to investment
operations. In the case of investment operations which are in the course of
implementatior, when the reform process is initiated, the Bank may need to assist
borrowers in revising the operations appropriately, or terminating them and
introducing other operations better suited to the conditions.
28.         In addition, the Bank is in a better position to assist borrowers
in designing operations appropriate  to reform conditions.   For example,
investments which depend on controlled output prices are unlikely to be viable
in an inflationary environment unless there is an assurance that they will be
adjusted to maintain a satisfactory margin. Banks in Yugoslavia probably are
not in a position to perform all the functions of intermediaries until they
become independent of their clients and learn to operate in a competitive,
inflationary environment. (Banking reforms are underway.) Credit is not likely
to be a suitable form of financing in an inflationary environment unless an
effective system of indexing (of principal) is introduced.  (Reforms in the
credit system are being initiated, although the situation for agriculture is not
yet clear.) Enterprises are unlikely to survive the reform process unless they
) ave a basic comparative advantage and strengthen their marketing and financial
capabilities.  Factors such as these should be taken into consideration in
preparing future operations.
29.         As noted above, procurement was a major problem throughout the
project and even led to the elimination of one subproject. Thus even greater
efforts are likely to be necessary in future operations to work with the agencies
and reach an understanding that the requirements must be met if the Bank funds
are to be used for the relevant investments. For any future projects, standard
procurement documents should be agreed at some level (national or perhaps
republic) prior to Board presentation and a clear understanding reached with
investors and intermediaries that Bank procurement procedures will be followed.
Furthermore, the Bank should be prepared to apply appropriate remedies in cases
of noncompliance with agreed procedures. The Bank should recognize that this
and other unique features of working with socialist countries have implications
for staff input coefficients, which may need to be increased for these countries.
30.         The BCR is critical of matters such as the procurement procedures,
the high cost of the Bank loan, what PBS considers to be excessively high cost



10
estimates, the use of surplus loan funds, and the Bank's use of currencies other
than those of supplier countries. Several of these issues relate to general Bank
policy, although the questions of high cost estimates and use of surplus loan
funds are more specific to the project.   Cost estimates generally were
reasonable, given the original designs, but real depreciation of the exchange
rate could not be foreseen, and there was a substantial lag between expenditure
and withdrawal from the loan. When loan surpluses did appear, they should have
been cancelled promptly, but lengthy discussions occurred about utilization of
the funds for other investments which enterprises were unable to justify.
Borrower Performance
31.         PBS put forth a considerable amount of effort in preparing the
project, including the production of a preparation report, and it also retained
an agroindustry specialist to assist it in super-ising the implementation of
subprojects.  P4wever, it was not able to meet all of its obligations.  As noted
above, PBS is owned by its major borrowers and therefore cannot exercise
independent judgment on loan applications.   Furthermore,  it does not have
experience in operating as a self-reliant entity in an inflationary, increasingly
competitive environment which places special demands on borrowers (e.g. with
respect to marketing and financial management) and on banks (e.g. concerning
asset and liability management, t-he impact of negative real interest rates and
foreign exchange rate depreciation, and the appraisal and supervision of loans).
PBS did not ensure that investors provided a satisfactory amount of equity for
the financing of subprojects, perhaps because it was unable to require that the
investors complied. Nor did it apply the interest rate arrangements agreed under
the SAL (although interest rates were a problem with virtually all projects in
Yugoslavia).  PBS agreed to provide at least four staff-months of technical
services to borrowers each year, but supervision of the subprojects was judged
to be inadequate. And PBS did not support the Bank's efforts to have enterprises
prepare financial projections which would demonstrate the impact of factors such
as pricing policy, foreign exchange rate depreciation, and rising nominal
interest rates.10 In summary, banks presently are not capable of playing the
normal role played by financial intermediaries in countries with market or mixed
economies.   However, Yugoslavia is initiating banking reforms, which would
increase the independence of banks from their borrowers and strengthen their
ability to appraise and supervise investments. The Bank may support such reforms
through structural adjustment and financial sector operations.
PART IIV
10As noted previously, PBS points out that there was a provision for
reducing the investors' equity contributions, that there was disagreement
about the applicability of the SAL interest rate arrangements, and that
it considered financial projections in an inflationary environment to be
extremely difficult.
"This section was prepared by the Bank on the basis of the borrower's
completion report and has been reviewed by the borrower.



ll                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~i
32.         The borrower completion report (BCR) is largely descriptive and
focuses on implementation of the investments and the issues involved in
implementation, such as procurement and the use of surplus loan funda. Operation
of the agroindustry subprojects and the irrigation component is described
briefly, in general terms.
33.         The BCR indicates that the project was completed within the planned
implementation period, except for the Brcko vegetable oil plant which
necessitated the extension of the loan closing date by one year. However, it
notes that there were delays in the agroindustry suborojects caused by slow
preparation of designs, modification of designs, procurement procedures,
provision of equity contributions by investors, and processing of subloan
increases to accommodate inflation.
34.         The report is particularly critical of Bank procurement procedures,
which PBS feels resulted unjustly in the elimination of the Modrica flour mill
and the prolonged implementation period for the Brcko vegetable oil plant, and
in general caused delays which led to increases in investment costs and Bank loan
cost (because of the commitment fee). The report is also strongly critical of
the high cost of the Bank loan, which resulted not only from the commitment fee
but also from the fixed interest rate of 11.6X and the front-end fee of 1.5%.
It suggests that commitment charges were excessive because they resulted in part
from delays attributed to Bank procurement requirements, as mentioned above, in
part from what PBS considers to be unrealistically high project cost and foreign
exchange estimates, and in part from funds which eventually were cancelled.  PBS
feels that the loan costs should be adjusted in light of the subsequent course
of interest rates, the elimination of the front-end fee, and experience with
project implementation.  Another related matter is the surplus loan funds which
PBS feels resulted largely from inflated cost and foreign exchange estimates,
and elimination of the Modrica subproject.  PBS criticizes the Bank for failing
to allow the use of these funds for additional investments within approved
subprojects or for other subprojects.
35.         At the time the BCR was prepared in March 1988, PBS estimated FRRs
of 16-19% and yet indicated that the rescheduling of subloans might be necessary.
This discrepancy suggests that the FRR estimates were overly optimistic (assuming
that they were calculated properly) or that other operations of the investors
were faring poorly and were draining funds from the subprojects. No ERRs are
given in the BCR.   By the end of 1988, PBS reported that conditions had
deteriorated further and that the rates of return calculated previously were
unlikely to be achieved.
36.         Implementation of the PoDovo Polie irrigation scheme was reasonably
satisfactory (except for the individual sector portion), according to the BCR,
although the issue of the use of surplus Bank funds also arose in this case.
An FRR of 19X was calculated for the component, and it still appeared viable at
the end of 1988.
37.         PBS indicated in the BCR that it undertook "indirect" supervision
of subproject implementation through extensive contacts with its basic banks
but that the investors did not provide adequate information on a regular basis
for thorough supervision of implementation. PBS noted that a "long-standing and



12
successful relationship" had been established with the Bank and that there was
"fruitful cooperatioti" during project implementation, but it mentioned that
there were difficulties concerning the matters discussed above.

Dear Hr. Lari,
We appreciate very much your letter dated April 3,1989 concerning the Project
Copletion Report (PCR) for Bosnia-Herzegovina Agriculbutal Development
Project (Loan 2136 YU) and would like to give the following com_nts:
1. It Is our opinion that the Project was being Implemented mnder complez
economic circumstances (being stated in PCR), which particularly reflected
high inflation rate which had not been expected at the time of Project
appraisal and approval of the Loan. Normally, such inflation caused major
diffieulties with respect to provision of local resources for overruns and
taking into regard limitations within the credit monetary policy in pacticular.
d U xbad- 2.   However, such a difficulty caused only the delay in construction of a vegetable
oil plant.Naturally, the investor had considerable difficulties to obtain
its own resources, which resulted in reduced participation of own resources
to 202 of total investments. PBS, pursuant to the authorizations provlded
Ebe s"*d a    for by the Loan Agreement (Schedule 3J 1 (a)) accepted even such a solution,
although not being financially the best one, as soze other solution could
adversly affect the Project implementation.Due to the understanding on the
Dlabuanzms p       part of the World Bank, loan resources for local costs increased(World Bank
bdco d     of  letter dated November 29,1983) which caused the increase  In participation
me ~.. km    of loan resources in overall costs (points 6 and 9 of PCR).
2. We agree with your point of view given in point 8 concernLag difficulties
z   dooas f _ *  with respect to purchases connected with agroindustry investments in
ZUU'5.U5 ^Yugoslavia. 4s a main reason for such a situation you mentioned "inability
or un willingnesa" of the Investor and PBS to met the Worl Bank requirements.
Unfortunately,you did not point out the complexity, slow realization and
even inconsistency (Flour Mill.Modrida) in application of this methodology.

PBS experienced a rather distinctive situation concerning Semberia Drainage
Project (Loan 2161 YU). where the- World Bank refused to accept the translation
error as an explanation which resulted In big. costs linrease to the Investor.
In repeated bidding the method of work accepted for Flour Hill, Ljubaca
was not accepted for Flou MIll, Modrica. Neither PBS nor the World Bank
faced any problems in implementation of the sub-projects financed by industrial
credit lines which, we thought, were successfully realized-Therefor, It would
be impossible to accept the opinion stating that there were "inability or
unwillingness" on the part of the Investor or PBS, however, more sorious
problems concerning the complexity and formalicy In apiplication of purchase
procedure were involved.
3. We are of the opinion that tnclision of point 10 of PCR is not justified
since the Schedule VB2(b) provides for the minimum interest rates applied
suefode *.   to local resources, except for the development funds, at 152, which Is fully
complied by PBS The formula of inte;est rates under SAL I could not be applied
to this Loan, since the same was set out after signature of the Loan Agreement
for this Project.
ca 1bdk ot    4.The estimate for Sub-project Popovo Polje-lrrigation given in point 13
vow"-        was unrealistic.Therefor, realigtic estimate should amount USD 7 million
_wkwas        only, instead of approximately USD 20 million, which could be find in Table
___r e   6 of PCR and based upon realized average tate for World Bank resources used
-aiuted to    for all disbursements in order to cover local costs. PCR appraisal with regard
is wos"A,,   to tocal utilized World Bank resources in the amount of USD 1,859.00 oniy
,autDpoz*d    (representing less than 1OX of Project costs) was also unrealistic.Tottl
I"w   esdl u,d.  Project costs were  considerably less in relation  to the given estimate.
5. With respect to the financial construction (point 14) concerning own
resources, the explanation is given in point 1 of this letter as well as
concerning major amount of loan resources. With -respect to banss' resources,
the development funds should be also treated as PBS resources and larger
participation of such resources should be highly benefitial for the Investor,
particularly when taking into regard the favourable conditions applied to
such resources.
Low utillzation of loan resources Is mainly che result of unrealistic estimation
9..      S     of the Project costs. as the scope of the Project was reduced only- by the
construction of Flour Mill in Modrica ,which was given up, and by reduced
areas in Popovo Polje, however the trend of domestic inflation was mainly
followed by Dinar depreciation.
6. We are of the opinion that the statement given in point 20 and exptaining
N-i5 Of vruk  that PBS and ATPR tosanska Krajtna were not interested in carrying out of
UamswuH        the measures aimed at agroindustry Improvement should not be accepted.Real
rmeJJAatAeb'  situation is completely different.The condicions required to achieve good
manufacturing results in 1988 have been secured through various measures
of financial consolidation imposed by PBS, except for the Fruit Processing
Plant, Prijedor which ks under liquidation now.Favourable -financial results
have not been yet achieved, mainly as a result of very high Interest rate
costs, as these organizations have entered major credit liabilIties.

Normally, such bad results vere affected by the price policy too.It is easy
to say that relevant organizations are not interested, hovevee lt Is much
more important to take tnto regard certain objective circuastances.The World
Bank is not ready and probably is not in the possibility to take participation
Into the financial consolidation of the projects, although it has assisted
the appraisal work and financing of these projects.The whole burden is undertaken
by the investors and domestic creditors, being reasonable,hover it would
be desirable to reconsider the possibilities to modify the World Bank policy
with regard to such cases.
Pus a    I -t  7.Polnt 21  specifies that PBS has not supported the preparation of financial
i- rUam .  projections, being partly  -ue only.Pirst of all, preparation of long-term
financial projectioias under high inflation rate is extremely difficult job.
However, we would like to potnt out that PBS has experienced the most serious
problems vith these projects as compared to all other projects financed by
World Bank loans and that tt has paid a great deal of attention to them,
particularly to solve the financial problems, and it i8 further doing its
see 90ot=*A S.   best efforts in order to solve consolidation and rehabllitation of relevant
projects including manufacturing and financial projections.However, we admit
that activities connected with solving the said problems might cot be carried
out in accordance with World Bank methodology.
umdu. r pus 3n 8. The ststement given in point 30 explaining that problems specified in
owA"a.         PCR are predominantly the result of the actions undertaken by the investor
and PBS is not acceptable since PBS was not at least the one to estimate
the project costs which reflected high discrepancies resulting in high costs
to the investor (colmitment fee, front end fee).We must point out that no
undexstanding was shown, but rather a formal access was applied when considering
the proposals for utilization of surplus funds, under previously achieved
agreements with representatives of the World Bank, which caused certain delay
in cecallation of loan prtion and affected the increase of loan costs.
Emphasizing the impact of nonperforuance of the conditions set out for application
of the purchases system as main reason for prolongation of the project implemencac
Ls true only in one part,i.e. with regarrd to Flour Mill,Hodrica, since the
iovestor did not comply with prescribed procedure during the first bidding,
but in the second bidding the World Bank did not accept the procedure accepted
and applied by itself to Flour Mill, Ljubada.The Preojecc vas implemented
in accordance with scheduled terms, except for the Edible Oil Plnt, which
was -rather the result of domestic resources shortage than purchase procedures
themselves.
The conclusion stating that low utilization of loan funds is highly caused
by bad performance of the investor and pBS is very unreasonable.However,
the fact is that the Project has been completed in accordance with the Contracc
(except for the Flour Mill.Modrica and a part of irrigations in Popovo Po;Ie)
utilizing cather less amount of funds In relation to the estimate and under
increased participation of World Bank resources.Such a treatmen t of the
costs should be conside-red professional and highly reasonable, as the sub-projects
have been implemented with less resources.We could not help asking a question
as to what would have been the position of the investors if they had utilized

the whole loan reources for the van capacittes.We think that this need
no further explanation.
9. With respect to the foot note 3 we wish to aee*nd you that Mr. S. Hartinovi4,
President of PIS wrote a letter to 'r. 2halvitt s a reply to hLelotter and
Mr. Martinovid expressed his disagreement with Mr. Thalhits's reply, particularly
with regard to the position of the World lank towards the utilieation of
surplus funds, loan costs for cancelled loan portion. cesponsibilit: of tho
World lank for the project results, and utilisatLon of other cutrrncies
In relation to the currencies of equlpment/services supplirs.
10. With respect to the opinion that PM5 did not provide rquired partielpacton
of the investor (point l1,PCR) wo jave explnacton in point Is and Sor interest
rates tn point I and tn potnt 7 of this letter we explained the situation
concerning the lack of adequate support to proptaation of financial projection ,
til  With respect to Parvt U   we would sullest thatfigures concerning approved
and ctillzed loan wount for spoo Iac subprojects should be Inserted into
tablt 1 .n order co complete table I we think that the tms sl to be amended
with Loan 2138 YU.
cas _ tba-din   In table 4, column 5, the amount of USD 6,9 million should be Inserted
to  as a reallstic estimate for Popovo Polje instead of USD 19,5, therefor total
"w4"4b         amount should be USD 39,3 allilon Instead of 32,1 sillIon.This new vulue
io created on the basis of UWD exchange cate for utilIsod loan funds which
followed domestic funds. ThIs modificatton should apply to table 5.
We hope that you wouldftnd tho above cem ente useoul co you in peoparation
of a final PCM
Much oblIged for your kind cooperation, we rwain with best regards,
Very truly yours.
