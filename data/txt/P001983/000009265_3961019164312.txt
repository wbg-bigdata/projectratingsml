IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF NIGER
PUBLIC ENTERPRISE INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Credit 1838-NIR)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Public Enterprise
Institutional Development Project in the Republic of Niger, for which Credit 1838-NIR in
the amount of SDR4.3 million (approximately US$5.5 million) was approved on June 25,
1987 and made effective on March 16, 1988.
The credit was closed on June 30, 1995, three years later than the original closing
date. Final disbursement took place on October 16, 1995, at which time a balance of
SDR246,274 (approximately US$367,7221 equivalent) was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Ms. Marilyn S. Manalo, Operations Officer, and Mr.
Jean-Pierre Thibaut, Consultant, Industry and Energy Division, West Central Africa
Department of the Africa Region and reviewed by Mrs. Mary Oakes Smith, Division Chief,
and Mr. Franz Kaps, Operations Adviser. Preparation of this ICR began during the Bank's
completion mission in May 1995. It is based on material in the project file, reports on
public enterprises, and discussions with World Bank staff and government officials
currently or formerly charged with project implementation. The Borrower contributed to
this report by commenting on the draft ICR and evaluating the project's preparation and
execution (Appendices 1-2).

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF NIGER
PUBLIC ENTERPRISE INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Credit 1838-NIR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    Starting in 1985 Niger commenced a structural adjustment program to address
internal and external imbalances resulting from the collapse of the uranium market in the
early 1980s and a period of rapid expansion in public sector employment. The first
Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) in 1986 supported the Government's efforts to
establish a new broad public enterprise sector policy framework, carry out institutional and
legal changes required to increase the efficiency of the sector, improve the general policy
environment and incentive system, and start a divestiture program.
2.    A second project, the Public Enterprise Sector Adjustment Program (PESAP),
effective in 1987, aimed at extending and deepening the reform process and focused on (i)
reinforcing controls on public expenditure and elaborating sound sectoral strategies to
guide future investments; (ii) liberalizing prices and developing incentive policies to
encourage private sector development; (ii) enhancing public enterprise (PE) autonomy and
accountability; (iv) rationalizing the parastatal sector through additional privatizations,
liquidations, and restructuring programs; and (v) completing the sector's financial
restructuring through debt settlement and measures to instill financial discipline. The
Ministry of State Enterprises (MSE), charged with implementing the PE reform program,
was weak and required institutional development and capacity building support; the third
project, Public Enterprise Institutional Development Project (PEIDP), was designed to
provide this support.
Objectives and Description
3.    The PEIDP was designed to strengthen the Government's ability to devise and
implement PE reforms, monitor the sector's progress and manage its development. It
financed the following components: (a) support for the MSE to strengthen its oversight
and control responsibilities in formulating and implementing the reform program; (b) a
general sector reform program which included (i) the formulation and implementation of
detailed divestiture programs for selected public enterprises; (ii) evaluation of the PE
legislation and review of public enterprise statutes in accordance with this legislation; (iii)
overall evaluation of the performance of the financial restructuring plan of the sector; (iv)
review of the impact of privatization and other reforms of the program; (v) studies of the
basic constraints of the parapublic sector particularly relating to staff remuneration,
financial control mechanisms, auditing and accounting norms, management, information
systems, oversight and control responsibilities to enable the Government to overcome these
constraints; and (vi) assistance to develop and implement tools to improve PE management



-ii-
(performance evaluation system, performance contracts, audits); (c) support for the
improvement of procurement procedures for the public sector, including PEs; (d) a
comprehensive training program for the personnel of both the Government and PEs; (e)
advisory services to restructure Office de Radio-Diffusion et T6l6vision du Niger
(ORTN); and (f) other technical assistance defined during project implementation which
included quality circles, preparation of audit and evaluation of Office du Lait du Niger
(OLANI) and Societ6 Nig6rienne de Produits P6troliers (SONIDEP), and studies for
Societ6 Nigerienne d'Electricite (NIGELEC).
4.    The Project's objectives to support the PE reform agenda as described above were
justified given that the changes pursed under PESAP were comprehensive, wide ranging,
and the available resources and expertise were limited quantitatively and qualitatively.
However, the project was hastily prepared, incorporated too many components, and failed
to include safeguards and alternative strategies to deal with the pre-identified risks of slow
and poor project implementation. Project implementation problems resulted from weak
Government commitment to the PE reform program and limited private sector response. It
also did not include qualitative and quantitative criteria with which the impact and
objectives of the project could be measured.
Implementation Experience and Results
5.    Since PEIDP was conceived to support PESAP, PESAP's accomplishments have a
bearing on the assessment of the PEIDP's achievements. Like PESAP wherein
achievements were weak particularly in fiscal and civil service reforms, PEIDP's objectives
were only partially met and in varying degrees.
6.    While the objective of strengthening the technical capacities of the MSE was
partially achieved, weak Government commitment prevented it from playing a strategic
role in the process of designing and implementing reforms of the parastatal sector. The
implementing unit was marginalized and implementation of divestiture strategies for target
enterprises were either not carried out or delayed. A review of legislation on public
enterprises resulted in the amendment of the laws and update of the by-laws for the PEs.
The evaluation of the financial adjustment plan for the parastatal sector enabled the
Government to settle a portion of its debts and recapitalize certain PEs. However, its
arrears to some PEs re-emerged and continue to grow. Measures to reduce state
consumption or procedures for realistic budget allocations were not defined. Also, a
remuneration study was carried out but the recommendations were not adopted leading to
a general increase in salaries with no improvement in the productivity of the enterprises.
The management information system at the implementing unit is operational but its
capabilities are limited. Although audits were conducted for the PEs and the quality of
accounting information improved, many PEs continue to provide late annual financial
reports to which auditors have difficulties providing unqualified opinions. For ORTN, an
accounting system was introduced and a performance contract is being implemented.
Other complementary activities including rehabilitation plans for various enterprises,
privatization plans, quality circles were all implemented but with little or undetermined
impact.



-iii-
7.    The major factors that contributed to the weak implementation and final outcome
of the project include: (i) a difficult socio-economic environment; (ii) lack of political
commitment; (iii) flaws in the conception, design and implementation of the program; (iv)
inadequate project supervision efforts; and (v) an unfavorable business environment.
8.    As was the case with PESAP, the project was designed to build on previous
reforms successfully implemented under SAC. The project designers were over-ambitious
and included many project components without the benefit of careful assessment of the
background, experience and qualifications of the Government and Bank staff on
privatization matters. Project design was theoretical and mechanisms were not built into
the project to counter the identified risk of slow project implementation resulting from
increases in bureaucratic interests among ministries and public enterprises, weak fiscal and
civil service reforms, poor Government commitment, and limited private sector response.
9.    The supervision efforts of the Bank focused on ensuring that the individual project
components were implemented without a full appreciation of the state of the privatization
program as a whole. As a result, although much time and resources were allocated to
support the necessary technical work and recommendations therein, little was accomplished
in the public sector reform efforts prior to and after two extensions of the project closing
date in the absence of either project restructuring or suspension until PE reform measures
were taken or a change in political will occurred.
10.   Following political and social events, successive governments beginning in 1990
were unable to persuade public opinion in support of the PE reform program. The project
management unit, itself marginalized and unable to carry out its management role, failed to
make any real impact on the process of reforming the parastatal sector. In the absence of
any political commitment to implement PE reforms, the country had very little return on its
investment under this project.
11.   The limited capacity building achievements under the PEIDP project are
unsustainable unless changes that are supportive to the PE reform efforts occur in the
political, economic and social environment, the Government fully commits to the
privatization program, and a business environment conducive to private sector participation
is developed.
12.   Based on the fact that: (i) the institutional development objective of the project
was marginally achieved; (ii) the activities planned, although largely carried out, did not
produce the anticipated results, particularly in terms of the "facilitation" and success of
PESAP; and (iii) the sustainability of the achievements of the project is very uncertain, the
project's outcome is rated unsatisfactory.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
13.   Given the continued (since 1990) deterioration of the public enterprise sector as
evidenced by high revenue losses, large cross debts, and a bigger but ineffective work
force, the Government will need a divestiture program grounded in legal and political
legitimacy. A mechanism that provides clear guidelines, accountability, an adequate
decision making process, and incentives should be developed to support this program.



-iv-
14.   The following lessons can be drawn from the implementation of the PEIDP as a
project providing institutional capacity building support in the divestiture program: (i) to be
effective, the project should be executed in a proper macro- and socio-economic
environment; (ii) a genuine and continuous commitment from the Government to a
carefully and thoroughly analyzed and planned program is a pre-requisite for support;
(iii) an open and on-going dialogue between the Government, interested and affected
parties and the private sector should be established; (iv) a good monitoring and evaluation
mechanism is necessary to collect relevant data and information for the assessment of the
program and design of future ones; (v) technical expertise should be made available to
provide strategic support in project management particularly when the reform processes
are new and/or difficult; and (vi) the closing date of a project should not be extended when
realization of its objectives are remote.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF NIGER
PUBLIC ENTERPRISE INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1838-NIR)
PART I: PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
L. BACKGROUND
1.    The uranium boom years of the 1970s saw Niger's public ownership of economic
activities grow at a fast pace. During this period, public sector enterprises were one of the
main instruments used by the Government to establish or strengthen productive sectors, to
produce essential goods and services, to control prices, and to promote employment
opportunities. In 1985, the public enterprise (PE) sector, excluding the two majority
foreign owned uranium mining companies, employed about 50 percent of the combined
labor force of the private and parastatal sectors. It accounted for 28 percent of
production, 35 percent of value added, 31 percent of the outstanding domestic debt, and
almost 50 percent of Niger's foreign debt. Following the downswing in the uranium
market in the early 1980s, Niger's exports and tax revenues decreased. The performance
of the PE sector deteriorated following investment mistakes, unclear and conflicting
objectives, inappropriate policies and regulations, deficiencies in the legal and institutional
framework and poor management resulting in a serious drain on the country's economy
and public finances.
2.          To redress the situation, the Government adopted in 1985 a comprehensive
reform program as part of its structural adjustment effort. Under the first Structural
Adjustment Credit (SAC) in 1986, the Government took measures to establish a new
broad PE sector policy framework and carry out institutional and legal changes required to
increase the efficiency of the sector, improve the general policy environment and incentive
system, and start a program of divestiture development. The second phase of the reform
program was supported under the Public Enterprise Sector Adjustment Program
(PESAP). Effective in 1987, the project aimed to extend and deepen the reform process,
particularly resource management and parastatal reform. Its focus was on (i) reinforcing
controls on public expenditure and elaborating sound sectoral strategies to guide future
investments; (ii) liberalizing prices and developing incentive policies to encourage private
sector development; (ii) enhancing public enterprise autonomy and accountability; (iv)
rationalizing the parastatal sector through additional privatizations, liquidations, and
restructuring programs; and (v) completing the sector's financial restructuring through
debt settlement and measures to instill financial discipline.
3.          The Ministry of State Enterprises (MSE), created in 1984, led the reform
program and served as the focal point for coordinating and implementing the first phase
and for designing the second phase of the PE reform program (PESAP). The Ministry,



-2-
however, was weak and required institutional support to extend and deepen the reform
efforts envisaged under PESAP. This Public Enterprise and Institutional Development
Project (PEIDP) was designed to provide the institutional development and capacity
building support.
II. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
4.           The objectives of PEIDP were to address the long-term question of
strengthening the Government's ability to devise and implement PE reforms, to monitor
the sector's progress and manage its development; and to strengthen the comprehension
and capability of the PE managers to implement the divestiture program.
5.           PEIDP financed the following project components: (a) support for the
MSE to strengthen its oversight and control responsibilities in respect of the formulation
and implementation of the reform program (consultancy services of a resident advisor,
vehicles, and equipment) and to prepare annual project audits; (b) a general sector reform
program which included: (i) the formulation and implementation of detailed divestiture
programs for selected public enterprises; (ii) evaluation of the PE legislation and review of
public enterprise statutes in accordance with this legislation; (iii) overall evaluation of the
performance of the financial restructuring plan of the sector; (iv) review of the impact of
privatization and other reforms of the program; (v) studies of the basic constraints of the
parapublic sector particularly relating to staff remuneration, financial control mechanisms,
auditing and accounting norms, management, information systems, oversight and control
responsibilities to enable the Government to overcome these constraints; and, (vi)
assistance to develop and implement tools to improve PE management (performance
evaluation system, performance contracts, audits); (c) support for the improvement of
procurement procedures for the public sector, including PEs; (d) a comprehensive training
program for the personnel of both the Government and PEs; (e) advisory services to
restructure Office de Radio-Diffusion et Television du Niger (ORTN); and (f) other
technical assistance defined during project implementation which included quality circles,
preparation of audit and evaluation of Office du Lait du Niger (OLANI) and Societe
Nigerienne de Produits Petroliers (SONIDEP), and studies for Soci&e Nigerienne
d'Electricite (NIGELEC).
6.           The Project, as designed, was fully justified given the reforms being
pursued under PESAP were comprehensive, wide ranging, involved several ministries and
PEs, and the available resources were quantitatively and qualitatively limited. However,
possibly influenced by some successes in the reform program under SAC, the designers
were overly ambitious and included too many project components. Also, while the risk of
slow project implementation resulting from increases in bureaucratic interests and the
reform effects on institutional relationships and relative powers among ministries and
public enterprises were correctly identified, safeguards and alternative strategies were not
identified to reassess either the form or the recipients of support when problems including
insufficient fiscal and civil service reforms, weak Government commitment, and limited
private sector response arose. The inclusion of qualitative and quantitative criteria to



-3-
measure the performance of the project and the Direction des Participations (DP, Ministry
of Finance), the management unit of the PEIDP project, would have been a useful tool to
measure the impact of the project and to serve as an educational instrument to win public
confidence.
III. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
7.           The achievement of the project objectives will have to be evaluated in the
broader context of the divestiture program and the fulfillment of PESAP's objectives. The
PE reform objectives under PESAP were partially achieved as the Government's
commitment waned significantly when the political situation deteriorated and it was
pressured to satisfy special interests. As summarized below, PEIDP's objectives also were
only partially attained and with varying degrees of success.
Part A: Support of the MSE
8.           The objective of strengthening the Ministry's capacity was to enable it to
play a strategic role in the process of designing and implementing reforms in the parastatal
sector. While considerable support in terms of technical assistance, training and material
inputs was provided, the Ministry played only a modest role and has had a limited impact
on the PE reform process. Since about 1990/1991 the DP has become an administrative
manager of the government portfolio and its role in assisting the Government in preparing
and introducing PE sector reforms increasingly has become marginalized. This de facto
situation was largely the result of a weakening of the political will to implement the sector
adjustment program as originally designed.
9.           During project implementation, continued support for the DP was justified
on the grounds that there was technical work to be done before any political decision
concerning the PEs could be taken. From a medium term perspective, however, the
objective of maintaining these technical capacities is likely to be compromised if the DP
remains marginalized. The technical skills acquired through the project could gradually
disappear following a significant turnover of officials and staff demotivation stemming
from the lack of appreciation and support for reform work by the political authorities.
Part B: Sector Reform Program
10.         This component had six sub-components which were carried out with
varying degrees of success. The objective of the first sub-component was to develop and
introduce divestiture strategies and procedures for target enterprises following a
diagnostic review of 54 PEs conducted in 1984. At that time, it was recommended that
25 of these enterprises would undergo total or partial privatization or liquidation; four
would be liquidated; and the state would reduce its ownership in nine other enterprises.
Under PEIDP, the necessary technical studies were conducted but implementation of the
recommendations suffered from numerous setbacks because: (i) the National Conference
formally opposed the reform measures; (ii) under pressure from the labor unions, there



-4-
was no political will to carry through with the reforms; and (iii) there was little interest
from potential buyers in the private sector. In mid-1995, the Government portfolio
included 62 enterprises: 20 autonomous government agencies (EPAs), 19
industrial/commercial enterprises (EPICs), 4 state corporations (SEs) and 19 mixed
enterprises (SEMs) (Appendix 3). The creation of a new category of PEs, the EPAs,
contributed to an increase in the number of PEs. Appendix 4 summarizes the status of the
privatization and liquidation operations.
11.         The second sub-component covering a review of the PE statutes and an
evaluation of the PE legislation was carried out. Following completion of the review and
based on the recommendations therein, the laws were amended and the bylaws of EPAs,
EPICs, SEMs and SNs were updated.
12.         Under the third sub-component, an evaluation of the financial restructuring
plan of the sector was carried out. The impact of its implementation was limited because
budget allocations were unrealistic and government expenditure controls were
unsustainable. Under PESAP, the Government settled a portion of its debts and partially
recapitalized certain PEs. However, at present, the Government again has large arrears
with NIGELEC, Societe Nationale des Eaux (SNE) and Office des Postes et
Tlelcommunications (OPT). Appendix 5 provides the status of reciprocal debts between
the principal PEs and the Government.
13.         The fourth sub-component, a study of the impact of privatization and other
reform measures, was conducted. The study enabled the Government to appreciate the
complexity of the privatization process particularly with regard to appropriate methods of
evaluating enterprises and selecting buyers and to draw lessons on the factors contributing
to the failure or success of certain rehabilitation or privatization operations. The full
benefits of this work can be realized only after continued implementation of a realistic
program supporting state divestiture policies.
14.         The fifth sub-component, designed to address the basic constraints of the
parapublic sector, had mixed results. First, a staff remuneration study to define the
possibilities and conditions for introducing a system of incentive payments within the PEs,
based on individual performance, was carried out. The recommendations, however, were
not introduced in a rational manner and led instead to a massive increase in salaries and
staff with no improvement in the productivity of the enterprises. Second, a study on the
responsibility for overseeing and monitoring PEs was conducted and led to the abolition in
December 1989 of the MSE and the transfer of its functions to the DP under the Ministry
of Finance. Third, other studies including the financial auditing mechanisms for PEs,
accounting and auditing principles for PEs, and management information systems (MIS)
were not implemented given weak support by the managers of the PEs.
15.         The sixth sub-component aimed to strengthen the capability of the MSE
and selected public enterprises by introducing an effective MIS, preparing performance
contracts for selected PEs, and carrying out annual audits of selected PEs. The MIS was
introduced and is operational but is limited in coverage and capability. Covering only



-5-
a sample of 20 PEs, it does not serve as a useful decision-making tool. Information is
insufficient and untimely making it difficult to determine the financial flows between the
state and the PEs and to evaluate the burden they place on public finances.
16.         Although performance contracts were "negotiated" and established with
the following PEs, NIGELEC, Societe Nigerienne de Charbon (SONICHAR), OPT,
Office des Produits Vivriers du Niger (OPVN), ORTN, Soci6t6 Nationale de Transport
du Niger (SNTN) and SNE, they were not rigorously prepared nor effectively monitored
in spite of the establishment of ad hoc committees. In addition, the state was unable to
meet its financial obligations to the PEs (NIGELEC, OPT, SNE).
17.         Support for the preparation of annual audited accounts resulted in
numerous audits of the accounts and finances of the principal PEs being conducted by
local and international firms and in the improvement in the quality of the accounting
information. The impact of this work is, however, limited as numerous PEs continue to
provide annual financial statements that are very late and receive qualified opinions from
auditors and recommendations from auditors are very often not implemented by the PEs.
Part C: Procurement
18.         The objective of this component was to achieve greater transparency in
procurement mechanisms and to lower acquisition costs through the free play of
competition. A new code for government contracts was officially implemented but the
absence of accompanying procedures, incentives and an understanding of the procedures
by the administrators prevents it from being systematically enforced.
Part D: Training
19.         This component was to support the training of PE and Ministry officials in
enterprise management methods and in accounting, finance, performance monitoring,
strategy, human resource management, purchases, inventory control, etc. Many benefited
from the program which undeniably resulted in the quantitative and qualitative
development of local skills in the area of enterprise management. The impact of the
training activities, however, was relatively modest because human resource management
was weak, staff turnover was frequent, and PEs resisted adopting some new or improved
management methods.
Part E: Restructuring of ORTN
20.         The objective of the technical assistance to ORTN was to: (i) design and
introduce an accounting system and (ii) prepare a performance contract. These were
implemented.

Part F: Other Projects
21.         Under this component, the Government defined, in agreement with the
Bank, other activities which had not been identified during the project design phase but
were likely to contribute to the success of the PESAP and the reform program. Relevant
reorganization or rehabilitation plans were prepared for Caisse Nationale de Securite
Sociale (CNSS), SNE and NIGELEC. Implementation of the recommended restructuring
measures for these organizations, however, was limited by the financial constraints
brought about by non-payment of government arrears. Also, studies were conducted to
prepare a plan of action for the total or partial privatization of the following enterprises,
COPRO-NIGER, Societe Nigerienne des Assurances Leyma (LEYMA), Fonds
d'Intervention des Petites et Moyennes Entreprises Nigeriennes (FIPMEN), Societe
Nigerienne de Transit (NITRA), Societ6 Nig6rienne des Textiles (SONITEXTIL),
Abattoirs de Niamey and OLANI. COPRO-NIGER is being liquidated, state exposure in
LEYMA and NITRA was reduced, and OLANI was evaluated for eventual privatization.
In addition, the process of liberalizing certain sectors (pharmaceutical products,
importation of oil-based products) controlled by monopolies (Office National Des
Produits Pharmaceutiques et Chimiques (ONPPC), SONIDEP) commenced but remains
stalled following the Government's indecision on these matters.
22.         Another activity, the formation of "Quality Circles," was an initiative
agreed upon between the Bank and the Government in 1992 to improve the performance
of PEs. Based on encouraging results obtained in Burkina Faso, the DP, Centre Nig6rien
de Perfectionnement en Gestion (CNPG), several enterprises, including Societe
Nig6rienne de Cimenterie (SNC), Riz du Niger (RINI), Soci6td des produits chimiques
du Niger (SPCN), SONICHAR and OLANI, decided to adopt this management method
and benefited from technical assistance. However, training was provided only
intermittently making it difficult for the full implementation of the quality circles process to
take place. Despite this, quality circles are still functioning at OLANI, SPCN, RINI and
SONICHAR and with reported improvements in staff behavior.
23.         The credit was closed on June 30, 1995, three years later than the original
closing date generally to allow more time to carry out technical work and support the
recommendations therein. The Government and the Bank agreed to extend the closing
date for the first time to conduct a retrospective study of PESAP and to elaborate the next
phase of the PE sector rationalization and privatization program based on its
recommendations. The second extension was to: allow the concept of quality control
circles to be extended to interested public and private enterprises; and finance the audit of
the Caisse Nationale de Securite Sociale (CNSS) and the establishment of an MIS for the
DP. The third extension was to provide financing for the audit of OLANI and SONIDEP.
Total support for this project amounted to SDR4. 1 million. A total SDR246,274 was
canceled following final disbursement on October 16, 1995.

IV. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
24.         Overall, as discussed below, the factors that contributed to the generally
weak implementation performance under PEIDP are: (i) lack of Government
commitment; (ii) a difficult socio-economic environment; (iii) flaws in the conception,
design and implementation of the program; (iv) inadequate project supervision efforts; and
(v) an unfavorable business environment.
25.         The PESAP/PEIDP-supported privatization program took place at a time
when the Government, faced by a serious economic crisis, was implementing deep
structural changes and taking stabilization and liberalization measures. After a promising
start under SAC, social and political difficulties resulting from the adoption of the reform
program put a strain on the Government's commitment for PESAP and PEIDP beginning
in 1989. Also, while financial discipline in the PEs began to improve, the Government's
severe liquidity problems resulted in the recurrence of cross debts between the
Government and PEs and among PEs. As the PE sector shrunk and activities of industries
decreased following the liberalization of trade, the National Conference of 1991 was vely
critical of the reform program reflecting an incomprehension on the part of opinion leaders
and a lack of success on the Government's part to convince the Nigeriens on the need for
reform measures.
26.         Facing an economic and fiscal crisis, Government shifted its interest to
accessing external financing rather than maintaining a commitment to the adjustment and
privatization process. Because the PESAP was not designed to link satisfactory
implementation of the privatization component to tranche releases, the Government and
the Bank neglected the privatization program. As a result, the DP's leverage in
implementing PEIDP and PE reforms was greatly reduced. Political appointees who
headed the PEs did not feel compelled to implement reforrn measures and the acquired
technical skills of newly trained personnel were not fully appreciated following the high
staff turnover rates in the enterprises and the DP. The poor performance of the divestiture
program coupled with inadequate incentives by the Government to establish a good
business environment contributed to the lack of success in the privatization program.
V. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
27.         The limited capacity building achievements under the PEIDP project are
unsustainable unless there are changes to the political, economic and social environment,
the Government is fully committed to the privatization program, and the business
environment is conducive to private sector development.
VI. BANK PERFORMANCE
28.         The Bank's project preparation work was insufficient. As was the case
under PESAP, the PEIDP was inadequately prepared. Also, possibly influenced by some
successes in the reform program under SAC, the designers were overly ambitious and



-8-
included many project components without the benefit of careful assessment of the
background, experience and qualifications of the Government and Bank staff on
privatization matters. The project design was theoretical and grounded on the assumption
that a sound methodological approach and substantial technical assistance would suffice to
eliminate risks and ensure the MSE's leadership in a difficult reform process. In addition,
mechanisms were not built into the project to counter the identified risk of slow project
implementation resulting from difficult social and political circumstances, increases in
bureaucratic interests among ministries and public enterprises, weak execution of reforms,
poor Government commitment, and limited private sector response.
29.          The supervision efforts of the Bank focused narrowly on the mechanics of
project implementation without a full appreciation of the state of the privatization program
as a whole. Once it became clear that the Government was not interested in fulfilling its
commitments and the final tranche of PESAP was canceled, little was accomplished in the
public sector reform efforts when the Bank extended the project closing date twice
without either restructuring the project or suspending it until PE reform measures were
taken or a change in political will occurred.
VI1. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
30.          After a promising start, the project was soon hindered by political and
social events. Themselves unconvinced, successive governments beginning in 1990 were
unable to persuade public opinion (labor unions, management, personnel) of the necessity
and advantages of the reform process. In spite of numerous efforts to carry out virtually
all the activities, the project management unit, itself marginalized and unable to carry out
its management role, failed to make any real impact on the process of reforming the
parastatal sector. Under this technical assistance project, in the absence of any political
commitment to implement PE reforms, the country had very little return on its investment.
V1:[. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
31.          Based on the fact that (i) the institutional development objective of the
project was achieved only marginally; (ii) the activities planned, although largely carried
out, did not produce the anticipated results, particularly in terms of the "facilitation" and
success of PESAP; and, (iii) the sustainability of the achievements of the project is
uncertain, the project's outcome is rated unsatisfactory.
IX. FUTURE OPERATIONS
32.          Given the continued (since 1990) deterioration of the public enterprise
sector as reflected by high revenue losses, large cross debts, and a bigger but ineffective
work force, the Government will need a divestiture program grounded in legal and
political acceptance. Before the state disengages itself from productive and commercial
sectors (particularly in the areas of energy and transportation) and allows the private
sector to take over these activities based on open competition, a rapid (re)formulation and



-9-
implementation of its policy reforms will be required after broad-based political support is
obtained. A mechanism that provides clear guidelines, accountability, an adequate
decision making process, and incentives should support this program. The guidelines
should cover the criteria, sequencing, procedures (diagnosis of economic, sectoral,
financial, legal, technical, social issues of selected companies, preparation for sale,
evaluation of bids), and instruments for divestiture and selection of buyers.
33.          As a first step the Government should develop an inventory of its cross
debt and payments arrears position with all PEs. For the remaining enterprises in the
Government's portfolio which require restructuring, the Government will need to define
clearly the objectives to be attained in each individual case and the specific strategies and
inputs required. This implies that the (i) constraints on public utilities (services or rates)
have to be clearly defined; (ii) subsidies have to be calculated (financial forecasts); and (iii)
financial management (cost reduction and working capital requirement) of these
enterprises have to improve.
34.          In addition, mechanisms for contractual obligations (performance
contracts), with financial incentives for directors and salaried employees when successful
results are obtained, should be considered. Also, to provide new impetus to the reform
process, the Government will need to have open communications and a realistic dialogue
with its social partners in order to (i) develop awareness that the situation has become
financially untenable for the Government and (ii) achieve a consensus among all the
political and social parties involved regarding the strategy and mechanisms for recovery.
Following additional preparation and analytical work, the privatization (already accepted
in principle) of SNC, Office des Eaux du Sous Sol (OFEDES), Societe Proprietaire et
d'Exploitation de l'H6tel Gaweye (SPEHG), LEYMA, NITRA, SONITEXTIL and
Abattoir de Niamey could be carried out. Also, the liquidation of COPRO-NIGER,
FIPMEN and Societe Nigerienne d'Hotellerie (SONHOTEL) could be completed.
X. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
35.          The following lessons can be drawn from the implementation of the PEIDP
as a project providing institutional capacity building support in the divestiture program: (i)
to be effective, this type of project should be executed in a proper macro- and socio-
economic environment; (ii) a genuine and continuous commitment from the Government
to a carefully and thoroughly analyzed and planned program is a pre-requisite for support;
(iii) an open and on-going dialogue between the Government, interested and affected
parties and the private sector should be established; (iv) a good monitoring and evaluation
mechanism is necessary to collect relevant data and information for the assessment of the
program and design of future ones; (v) technical expertise should be made available to
provide strategic support to the management particularly when the reform processes are
new and/or difficult; and (vi) the closing date of a project should not be extended when
realization of its objectives are remote.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PUBLIC ENTERPRISE INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1838-NIR)
Borrower's Evaluation
I.    Background
After a period of rapid economic growth, Niger's economic performance
deteriorated in 1981 as a result of a decline in uranium prices and a worsening of the terms
of trade. The economic slowdown markedly aggravated fiscal and balance of payments
problems, and severely constrained the country's development.
In response to these problems, the Government adopted a series of programs in
cooperation with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. As a result, the
first Structural Adjustment Program was signed in 1986, its objective being to establish a
sound foundation for economic development.
This was followed in 1987 by the PASEP (Public Enterprise Sector Adjustment
Project), entailing extensive measures that affected both public and private enterprises.
Because government resources were limited, the PDIEP (Public Enterprise Institutional
Development Project) was prepared, in order to support the authorities in implementing
the PASEP.
HI.   The Objective of the PDIEP
The objective of the PDEEP was to provide the Government with technical and
financial assistance in implementing the PASEP.
The project consisted of the following components:
Part A: General assistance for the Ministry of Finance and Planning (US$1.17 million).
Part B: Assistance in the implementation and monitoring of reforms (US$190,000).
B 1:  Preparation and implementation of strategies for government divestiture of
specific enterprises.
B2:   Planning of legislation and charters governing public enterprises.
B3:   Evaluation of the financial rehabilitation of the public enterprise sector.

B4:   Impact study of reform and privatization measures.
B5:   Assistance for the preparation of support measures for the reforms.
B6:   Assistance for the development of management tools and performance
contracts.
Part C: Assistance for the reform of procurement procedures (US$ 100,000).
Part D: Training (management) (US$1.88 million).
Part E: Reorganization of ORTN (US$700,000).
Part F: Other projects, to be identified during project implementation (US$250,000).
The project was implemented from May 1987 to June 1995, with a performance
rate of 92%, i.e. SDR 3,945,000 out of a total amount of SDR 4,300,000 (see Annex 1).
HI.  Implementation of the Various Components
Part A: General Assistance for the Ministry of Finance and Planning
The purpose of this component was to provide general support (i.e. logistical and
technical) for the design and implementation of the reform programs.
There were shortcomings in the program of technical assistance. The supervisory
ministry could have used a consultant's experience to establish a general framework for
privatization operations. It could also have called upon him to train the project's
supervisory staff, to ensure that they would be fully capable of taking over. A series of
seminars was initiated to provide the training planned as part of the technical assistance,
but the problem in this case was the inadequate length of the seminars (15 days), since this
was not sufficient to enable the ministry staff to properly master some of the management
tools.
In spite of these shortcomings, it should be noted that the assistance had a positive
impact. With regard to logistics, the outcome was satisfactory, and as a result of this
assistance the Ministry was able to obtain computer hardware and, in particular, establish a
public enterprise database management system. The impact of the training was by no
means negligible, since staff from the supervisory ministry were taught to use a number of
management tools, such as performance contracts, internal and external audits, etc., so
that personnel standards were raised and, as a result, the Ministry was able to implement
and monitor a number of reforms.



Appendix 2

However, because of the large turnover of staff (mainly due to the lack of any
financial inducement to remain in the project), the stock of expertise thus developed could
not be maintained.
Part B: Assistance in the Implementation and Monitoring of Reforms
B 1:   Preparation and Implementation of Strategies and Modalities for
Government Divestiture of Specific Enterprises
The objective of this subcomponent was to define strategies and modalities for
government divestiture of the enterprises selected as a result of the 1984 diagnostic study
(see Annex 2).
This divestiture was intended to reduce the burden imposed on the government
budget by the public enterprise sector through the following actions:
*  issuing shares for the total or partial privatization of enterprises capable of being
restructured, or the liquidation of those enterprises considered impossible to
rehabilitate (28 of the total of 54);
* maintaining in the government portfolio only those enterprises operating in
strategic sectors; nevertheless, these were to be restructured, as necessary, and an
institutional and legal framework was to be drawn up for them.
A further purpose of the divestiture policy was to achieve the financial
rehabilitation of the public enterprises by reducing government arrears of payment and the
levels of reciprocal debt among the enterprises, improving the distribution of operating
subsidies, etc.
As a result of these studies, a number of measures were initiated and implemented,
thus enhancing public enterprise performance from 1984 to 1989 (see Annex 3).
Consequently, the main indicators have reflected a quite remarkable performance, in spite
of the sharp decline in turnover brought about by the serious economic and financial crisis
the country has suffered since the 1980s. Value added increased markedly, from CFAF 26
billion to CFAF 34 billion between 1993 [sic] and 1989, while the operating loss of CFAF
7.8 billion became an operating profit of CFAF 2.2 billion over the same period, and cash
generation and flow strengthened considerably. It must be emphasized that financial flows
between the Government and the public enterprises favored the former, this not being the
case before the reform of the parapublic sector.
However, from 1990 the financial position of the sector deteriorated, with a
decline in operating profits, an increasingly constrained cash flow in the enterprises, and
the reappearance of overdue reciprocal obligations between the State and the enterprises.



ADDendix 2
Page 4 of 12
This was caused by the ongoing general financial crisis, but more particularly by
the problems affecting the State, which was the public enterprises' main client. Moreover,
the National Conference and the labor unions were challenging further implementation of
the reforms and the principles underlying the liquidation and privatization of enterprises.
Nevertheless, the Government did proceed with its divestiture policy, to the extent
that 27 enterprises were either privatized or liquidated. A comparatively large number of
enterprises remained in its portfolio because of the creation of a new category, the EPAs
(etablissements publics a caraclbre administrati/).
B2:   Review and Revision of Legislation Governing Public Enterprises, and
Updating of their Charters
Up to 1986, the parapublic sector was characterized by the almost total absence of
any institutional or legal framework. The various public enterprises had different statuses,
and operating rules were different even for enterprises with the same legal classification.
On the recommendations of the various studies, a number of pieces of legislation
were adopted. Public enterprises were divided into four classifications, and the rules
governing the organization and operation of each were coordinated. For each
classification, provisions governing accounting and powers and procedures for appointing
deliberative bodies (i.e. Conseil d'Administration and Comite d'Etablissement) and
executive bodies (i.e. President du Conseil d'Administration and Directeur) were
established. The charters of all the public enterprises were revised to bring them into line
with standard forms, personnel rules were adopted, and salary scales were reorganized and
made consistent.
These measures served to reduce the management problems affecting public
enterprises and arising from the multiplicity of authorities supervising them, the various
powers of which were not clearly defined. Demarcations have now been drawn between
the responsibilities of overall supervision and direct supervision, and the powers assigned
to each of the various authorities have been delimited.
Although the State still tends to play a controlling role in public enterprise
management, this legislation brought about definite improvements by clarifying how
supervision was to be exercised and how public enterprises were to operate. The studies
carried out for this purpose were, therefore, very important.
B3:   Evaluation of the Financial Rehabilitation of the Parapublic Sector
A study of reciprocal debts and debt rescheduling was carried out as part of the
public enterprises' financial rehabilitation process. As a result of this study, a government
debt repayment program was prepared totaling CFAF 15.235 billion and scheduled over
three years (1987-89). Implementation actually took place from 1987 to 1990, the sum

From 1990, the continuing financial crisis in Niger once again produced an
accumulation of arrears owed by the government to certain public enterprises (in
particular, NIGELEC, SNE, OPT and ONPPC) and also of reciprocal debts among the
enterprises (see Annex 5).
This was caused by a failure to put into practice some of the recommendations
presented in the study.
As a means of preventing any further build-up of government arrears the study
had, in fact, recommended allocating under the budget an amount sufficient to cover the
government agencies' expenditures on electric power, water and telephone use.
In addition, a study was conducted to find ways of reducing the subsidy granted to
public enterprises and applying it more efficiently. It also suggested methods for
determining how much should be allocated to each of the enterprises, in accordance with
their particular functions. However, in spite of the relevance of these proposals, they were
not adopted by the Ministry of Finance, which simply proceeded to reduce the overall
amount of the subsidy. The resulting decline in the resources available to the enterprises
led to an accumulation of arrears of payment for power, water and telephone service. This
prompted the Directorate of Government Participation to recommend, in 1990, that
amounts be systematically deducted from the quarterly payments made to the subsidized
enterprises; however, although this measure was approved by the Treasury, it was never
actually implemented.
B4:  Impact Study of Privatization and Other Reforms
The study was made in 1992, and identified the main shortcomings encountered in
the implementation of privatization and other reforms. One such problem, which acted as
a limiting factor, was the failure to perceive the real significance of the economic and
financial crisis existing at the time of implementation; in fact, the crisis -- together with the
sharp falloff in government investment -- removed one of the basic mechanisms for
promoting and developing the private sector.
To that must be added a very defective knowledge of the real constraints and
problems affecting the private sector; i.e. the financial difficulties, inadequate appraisal of
opportunities, and lack of initiative that characterize the country's economic operators,
who prefer to concern themselves essentially with unstructured activities that tend to be
speculative and turn a quick profit. Likewise, the sudden implementation of the
liberalization policy boosted the informal sector, creating distortions and leading to
considerable losses in the turnover of local enterprises.
Despite these problems, the study emphasized that the reforms had had positive
effects on the position of public enterprises and on the government budget. Nevertheless,
these effects were still fragile and needed to be consolidated through changes in the



Atmendix 2
Page 6 of 12
organizational structure and "culture" of the enterprises. The latter, however, were
prevented from carrying out these changes by the continuing economic and financial crisis,
so that after 1989 the positive effects of the reforms had disappeared.
The study considers that reform of the public enterprise sector, together with
reestablishment of macroeconomic equilibriums, should continue to be a government
priority.
1.    For this reason, it makes the following recommendations:
(i)    From a strategic viewpoint, not all the problems should be tackled simultaneously.
A moderate approach should be adopted, concentrating on just a few objectives
and enterprises, which should be appropriately selected. It must be kept in mind
that the Government's capacity is constrained by its inadequate human and physical
resources. Certain tasks relating to rehabilitation operations, such as identifying
partners and procurement specialists, etc., should be subcontracted to consultants.
More elaborate and dynamic training should be provided for management staff.
From a financial viewpoint, the Government should prepare budget allocations that are
in line with the real consumption levels of its agencies, and settle its arrears so that the
enterprises can pay off their own debts, etc.
B6 (sic): Assistance for the Development of Management Tools
To improve monitoring and public enterprise performance, new management tools
were introduced into the enterprises themselves and the project management unit.
(a)    Establishment of a Public Enterprise Sector Management Information
System (MIS) in the Directorate of Government Participation
The public enterprise management information system established in the
Directorate of Government Participation is a tool for enabling the Government to have
rapid access to all information relating to the parapublic sector.
Consequently, the MIS should keep the authorities informed of management
prob!ems in the sector and of the status of financial flows between the Government and
the enterprises, so that their impact on the budget can be assessed.
It consists of two types of information: annual data and quarterly data.
Nevertheless, operation of the MIS has not been problem-free, because the
quarterly performance chart (which was intended to provide the authorities with an early
warning of any slippages in enterprise management) could not be made properly operational,
the reason being that the enterprises provided the necessary information either irregularly or
too late.



Apnendix 2
Page 7 of 12
Similarly, these problems arise when the annual data are collected, and so the
Directorate works with a representative sample of 21 enterprises when preparing its annual
report on the performance of the sector, since these represent about 90%/o of its value added
and turnover.
To summarize, the importance of the MIS in the management of the parapublic sector
is beyond question. Although a number of shortcomings in the way it is managed have indeed
become evident, it is nonetheless the main source of information on the parapublic sector in
Niger.
Consequently, the Directorate, with the support of the authorities, will endeavor to
strengthen the system by both upgrading the quarterly performance chart and identifying
methods of including the EPAs in the database.
(b)   Preparation and Introduction of Perfornance Contracts for Public Enterprises
In order to improve the management of those public enterprises that are required to
provide services in all circumstances, their relations with the State have been codified by means
of performance contracts (contrats programmes). The purpose of this tool is to reduce the
degree to which the supervisory agencies intervene in the management of the enterprises, thus
granting them increased autonomy, while the respective obligations of the parties are defined in
advance.
As a result, SONICHAR and NIGELEC signed contracts with the Government in June
1988, and OPVN, ORTN, OPT and SNTN entered into contracts in June 1989. In 1993,
contracts were signed with EPAs such as Niamey Hospital, Lamorde Hospital, Zinder
Hospital, the Niamey ENSP (National School of Public Health), and the Zinder ENSP. Finally,
a contract with SNE is in preparation, but has not yet been signed.
Under these contracts:
* the State has endeavored to honor its commitments, reviewing subsidies and
making systematic provision for them in the budget;
* management of the enterprises concerned has considerably improved, reliable
procedures have been introduced, accounts are now audited, human resources have
been strengthened wherever necessary, and overaD performance has improved.
In spite of these efforts, the execution of the contracts is affected by certain problems,
such as the failure to schedule meetings as regularly as stipulated. This is certainly because the
mechanism is such a recent innovation, but it is also partly due to shortcomings in the
dissemination of information within the parapublic sector. To overcome this problem, it was
decided in 1989 to have their monitoring committees operate like boards of directors, but this
stil did not enable the committees to meet as often as stated in the contracts. Moreover, the



ADpendix 2
Page 8 of 12
minutes are hardly ever used as a reference by the authorities concerned by the problems raised
at meetings, so that there is never any real feedback to the officials in the enterprises. Such
behavior could be taken as evidence of a lack of interest on the part of the Government, and
has caused the managers of enterprises either to lose confidence in the authorities or, in certain
cases, to use these external factors as a pretext to justify their internal management practices.
(c)    Annual Auditing of Accounts
The objective of this subcomponent was to enable public enterprises to produce reliable
data. To this end, several enterprises have received support under the PDEEP (see Annex 4).
In spite of auditors' reservations regarding the reliability of the financial and accounting data, it
should be acknowledged that the production of information in enterprises has been improved.
Because of the recommendations, a number of enterprises have rectified their accounting
practices, introduced certain accounts instruments and tools, and in some cases even altered
their accounting and management procedures. Such improvements could have been even more
far-reaching if all the auditors' recommendations had been implemented; however, sometimes
such measures would call for a level of human and financial resources that is beyond the reach
of the enterprises. It must be emphasized that the accounts are now externally audited,
although the enterprises' lack of funds has made it impossible to proceed with the type of
operational audits that would provide them with the strategic data they need for upgrading
management.
Part C: Assistance with Procurement Procedures
In light of the shortcomings in the Government's procurement system, a new Code was
prepared (with financial support from the PDIEP) and brought into force.
The second component in this reform, i.e. training for suppliers in the new procurement
procedures, was not implemented, because the budget allocated for this purpose did not
receive World Bank approval. Consequently, the stated objective for this component was only
partly achieved.
PartD: Training
A training program consisting of seminars, study visits, workshops, etc. was planned
and implemented, the cost being CFAF 628 million and the purpose being to raise the standard
of qualifications of staff in the ministries and enterprises in order to improve implementation of
the public enterprise reform program.
After the program had been in operation for a certain period, the seminar format was
found to be too abstract, and was replaced by the "active training" approach (formation-
action), which consists of finding solutions to the problems that have actually been encountered
by the participants during the course of their work. In spite of its advantages, the results left
something to be desired. There were several reasons for this, the main ones being the mobility



ADDendix 2
Page 9 of 12
of the staff that had received the training, and a lack of support on the part of the Directions
Generales, making it difficult for the lessons learned to be applied.
Nevertheless, the program did provide some help in improving the qualifications of
public enterprise officials, as well as making the authorities aware of the need in their agencies
for staff with expertise in fields such as budgetary control, internal auditing, etc.
Part E: Reorganization of OR TN
Under this component, an accounting system was designed for ORTN and duly
implemented, so that the organization is now able to provide accounting data in a timely
manner.
In spite of shortcomings in the application of this system (particularly with regard to
analysis), it can be claimed that the objective of this component was achieved.
Part F: Other Projects
The purpose of this component was to enable the Government (with the agreement of
the World Bank) to add to the project any supplementary activities that had not been
previously identified.
The following activities were added:
(a)    Privatization of Enterprises. Government Divestiture, and Deregulation of the
Traded Sectors (see Annex 4!.
Under the Government's divestiture policy, 11 public enterprises were partly or
completely privatized. Of these, five were the subjects of a preliminary study (VETOPHAR,
SICONIGER, SNC, ABATTOlR, and OLANI).
However, it should be emphasized that in the end some enterprises that were to have
been privatized were liquidated because no buyers were forthcoming.
SONIDEP and ONPPC are under consideration for possible privatization.
The number of enterprises privatized and liquidated is evidence of the Government's
efforts in the field of divestiture.
(b)   Ouality Circles
In order to improve public enterprise performance, and with the World Bank's
agreement, the Government undertook the establishment of quality circles as a management
tool, beginning in February 1993 with a sample consisting of four pilot enterprises (RNI,
SPCN, ONPPC, and SNC). Officials from these enterprises and members of the first circles to



ADDendix 2
Page 10 of 12
be established participated in seminars and study visits to Burkina Faso. In 1994, it was
decided to extend the experiment to other enterprises (OLANI, SONICHAR, NIGELEC and
HNN), and consciousness-raising seminars and study visits were arranged for their officials.
However, it was not possible to proceed to the practical stage of establishing circles in this
second group of enterprises because of a lack of the necessary financial resources, since the
allocation proposed for this purpose did not receive the Bank's approval.
Although one cannot make a quantitative evaluation of the circles' activities in the short
term, it appears that the effects have been positive, in light of the improvements observed
among the staff of the enterprises in question.
To summarize, most of the activities planned in the PDIEP were executed, although it
must be acknowledged that the objectives were only partly achieved.
IV.   Observations
The purpose of the PDIEP was to provide institutional support for the reform of the
public enterprise sector. Implementation was from March 1988 to June 1995, and the
following were the main objectives:
to rehabilitate public finances;
-     to improve public enterprise performance.
Now that the implementation period is over, it can be seen that the PDJEP has had
mixed results:
1.    After a decline in the arrears of government debt owed to the public
enterprises, they are building up once again, because of the Government's
cash flow problems.
2.    In spite of the problems encountered by the Government in persuading its
social partners of the need to adopt certain measures, efforts were made to
further the divestiture process.
3.    In spite of both the persistence of certain management problems within the
enterprises and the difficulties of evaluating the training program, it can be
claimed that the training did produce a more qualified staff in the enterprises
and supervisory ministries.
4.    Although the Direction des Participations has found difficulty in operating the
MIS, the latter does provide a means for the Government to monitor the
sector's performance.



AvDendix 2
Page 11 of 12
5.    Although there have been shortcomings in the implementation of performance
contracts, the latter have enabled the enterprises to upgrade their services.
It should be noted that the following factors contributed to what might be regarded as
shortcomings in the PDIEP:
*  The PDIEP's objectives were not clearly defined. There were numerous
components, with ill-defined implementation strategies.
*  There were many conditions attached to the release of the various tranches of the
Public Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit, and these were not clearly defined,
and sometimes difficult to comply with.
* Shortcomings in the supervision system prevented the Government from becomning
aware of slippages.
*  The World Bank was inflexible with regard to the conditionalities applied to the
release of financing on specific dates, taking no account of changes in the
environment.
* The Government was facing financial problems.
* Political changes caused monitoring to become lax and the will to sustain the
reform program to decline.
*  Inadequate consciousness-raising and a high degree of mobility among enterprise
officials did not facilitate implementation of the recommendations contained in the
studies.
V.    Recommendations for Ensuring the Success of Future Programs
To ensure the success of any future project of this type, the following precautions
should be taken:
Project Design
-     Any possible sociopolitical changes should be forestalled by seeking in advance
the support of all social partners likely to be affected by the measures.
Efforts should be concentrated on a minimum number of clearly defined
activities.



Appendix 2
Page 12 of 12
2.    Project Management
-     An autonomous organizational structure should be established, separate from
government agencies.
-     The problem of project staff mobility should be prevented by establishing a
system incentive payments.
-     Activities should be evaluated on the basis of their impact and not how many
there are of them or how long they last.
3.    Training
Before the financing is provided for any form of training, a commitment should
be entered into with the Directorate General regarding the new management
tools to be monitored by the project.
Project support should be provided only for enterprises that have prepared a
training plan.
Advanced training modules and three- or four-month practical courses in
clearly defined subject fields should be provided for staff involved in the
project.
