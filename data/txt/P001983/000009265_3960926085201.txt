MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF NIGER
FOR A PUBLIC ENTERPRISE INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to Niger
for SDR 4.3 million (US$5.5 million equivalent) is submitted for approval.
The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms and help finance a
project of institutional support for implementation of Niger's public
enterprise secter adjustment program (PESAP).
2.        Background.  Niger's public enterprise (PE) sector grew rapidly
durir.g the 1970s. Excluding the two majority foreign owned uranium mining
companies, the PE sector now accounts for 7 percent of GDP and employs some
11,500 workers. However, this sector has performed poorly and imposed a
serious drain on the economy and public finance, because of: original
investment mistakes; unclear and conflicting objectives of PEs;
Government's inappropriate policy and regulations; deficiencies in the
legal and institutional framework; and poor PE management. To redress the
situatior. the Government adopted, in 1985, a comprehensive reform program
as part of its structural adjustment effort. A detailed action plan was
prepared in consultation with IDA and its initial major steps became part
of the Structural Adjustment Credit (SAL) approved in February 1986.
Implementation of the reform program, including those aspects linked to the
SAL, is progressing well: measures have been taken to establish a new broad
PE sector policy framework and make the first round of institutional and
legal changes needed to increase PE efficiency, improve the general policy
environment and incentive systems, start a program of divestiture
(privatizations and liquidations), and encourage private sector
development. A second phase of these reforms has now been prepared in
consultation with IDA and forms the basis for Government's Public
Enterprise Sector Adjustment Program (PESAP) for 1987-90.
3.        The Ministry of State Enterprises (MSE), created in 1984, has led
the design and execution of the reform program. The MSE is responsible for
the oversight of all PEs, and for supervision of 26 selected PEs which are
deemed to require speedy action for divestiture or rehabilitation. Through
assistance provided under a PPF for the proposed project, the MSE has
established itself as the focal point for coordinating and implementing the
first phase of the PE reform program and developing the next round of
reforms. To do this effectively, the MSE requires additional skills in the
areas of divestiture, performance contracts, management information systems
and legal expertise. It also requires further development of its general
institutional capacity to manage the PE sector in concert with other
ministries. Finally, the management base within enterprises is still weak,
and efforts must be directed to strengthen the comprehension and
appreciation by PE managers of the reform process.
4.        Proiect Obiectives.  The objective of the proposed project is to
provide the institutional support needed by the Government in order to
extend and deepen its PE reform efforts, which would be supported through a



- 2 -
proposed PE Sector Adjustment Operation. More specifically, the project is
to address the long-term question of the strengthening of the Government's
ability to devise and implement PE reforms as well as to monitor the
sector's progress and manage its development in the future. This also
entails strengthening the capabilities of PE management to respond to the
changed policy environment, with direct assistance to ORTN (Radio and
Television) to implement its restructuring program.
5.        Project Description.  The proposed project aims at assisting the
Government in acquiring the necessary technical and administrative capacity
to formulate and implement the reform measures incorporated in the PE
Sector Adjustment Program through: (a) a program of general support
(resident PE advisor) plus vehicles, equipment and logistical assistance
for MSE; (b) the implementation and monitoring of specific reforms
(divestiture, legal statutes, financial restructuring, impact studies,
etc); (c) studies leading to the development of additional reforms
(financial controls, auditing norms, role of supervisory ministries, etc.);
(d) assistance to develop and implement tools to improve PE management
(performance evaluation system, performance contracts, audits, etc.); (e)
support for the improvement of procurement procedures for the public
sector, including PEs; (f) a comprehensive training program for the
personnel of both Government and PEs; (g) advisory services to restructure
ORTN; and (h) provision for other reform related tasks as subprojects.
Annual work plans would be established in agreement with IDA. The project,
to be carried out over three years, is estimated to cost US$5.7 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$5.0 million (88
percent). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement are shown
in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in Niger are given in Schedules C and D
respectively. A map is also attached. Since there is no separate staff
appraisal report, more detailed information on the proposed project is
provided in Annex I. The President's Report for the accompanying PE Sector
Adjustment Credit is No. P-4522 NIR, dated June 3, 1987.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  This project is essential to
IDA's strategy to help Niger carry out an economic adjustment program, with
a particular focus on the public enterprise sector. At the request of the
Government, IDA took a leading role early in the process of developing a
comprehensive PE reform strategy, which was supported through the first
SAL. These efforts will now be deepened and extended through the PESAP
with this proposed project concurrently focussing on the overall
institutional framework of the PE sector and one key enterprise. IDA
support of this operation will help ensure the successful implementation of
the adjustment program while concomitantly developing the institutional
base for sound management of the PE sector. IDA's continued involvement is
also needed to coordinate the rehabilitation of selected PEs under various
development projects.
'.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed to the following
actions: (a) establishment and staffing of a project unit in the MSE as a



-3-
condition of effectiveness; (b) preparation of a detailed training program
for Government officials and the PE personnel to be agreed with as a
condition of effectiveness; (c) a review of PE legal framework by September
30, 1989; (d) a review, in consultation with IDA, of the possibility of
integrating the project unit into MSE's structure by June 30, 1991; (e,
Government financing of the project unit each year, on an increasing basis,
starting FY87188 as a condition of effectiveness; (e) the preparation of
annual work plans for the unit by December 31, of each year; preparation of
the first of these for FY87/88 would be a condition of effectiveness; (f)
the preparation of a specific action program to be carried out by ORTN by
December 31, 1987, agreement of which would be condition of disbursement;
(g) ann.al audits and project monitoring procedures; (h) submission of any
subproject for IDA approval as a condition of disbursement. Effectiveness
of the Credit supporting the PESAP would also be a condition of
effectiveness.
8.        Justification.  The reforms being pursued under the PE sector
adjustment program are comprehensive and wide ranging, involving several
key ministries and numerous public enterprises. Through the project, these
reforms are to be institutionalized, and a lasting basis for better
management of the PE sector established. The main benefits expected from
the project are: (a) enhanced Government and PE capabilities for timely and
effective implementation of PE reform measures; (b) a solid institutional
framework for sustainable PE reforms in the long run; (c) improved
efficiency in PE management and government supervision of the PE sector;
and (d) technical basis and accompanying analysis for continuing the reform
process and designing the next generation of PE adjustment measures.
9.        Risks.  Following the major gains made already by Niger in
carrying out its adjustment program, the project should not entail any
inordinate risks. However, there is the potential for a slowing down of
the pace of reform, which could occur as the process of reform under the
PESAP becomes more demanding on bureaucratic interests and as the reform
affects the institutional relationships and relative powers among
ministries and public enterprises. The project is designed to minimize
these risks by adopting a deliberate approach with firm leadership from the
MSE, combined with solid technical analysis and assistance provided under
the project to overcome potential resistance and reinforce MSE's leadership
position. Moreover, MSE has effectively used similar assistance provided
thus far under the PPF.
10.       Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

NIGER
PUBLIC ENTERPRISE INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
A. Project Description
1.        Characteristics and Performance of the Sector.  As described more
fully in the President's Report for the accompanying Public Enterprise
Sector Adjustment Program (P-4522-NIR), public enterprises, which have been
one of Government's important instruments for development, grew rapidly
especially during the uranium boom in the late 1970s. They amount in 1987
to 64 enterprises, of which about one-third are essentially autonomous
administrative bodies and the rest are of a commercial nature and expected
to be financially self-sufficient. The thirteen largest and most important
PEs, excluding the two majority foreign-owned uranium mining companies, are
NIGELEC (the power company) with annual sales of CFAF 22 billion (US$67
million) in 1985, followed by SONIDEP (the petroleum distribution and
storage company), NITRA (the transit freight firm), SONICHAR (the coal
mining and electricity company', COPRO-NIGER (the import agency), BDRN (the
development and commercial bank), OPVN (the food grains stock management
agency), RINI (the rice milling company), OPT (the post and
telecommunications company), OFEDES (the civil works and rural water supply
company), SONARA (the ground nut exporting agency), SNC (the cement
factory) and Air Niger (the national airline).
2.        The sector's share in the economy is relatively small (7 percent
of GDP and some 11,500 workers) but its performance has been poor with a
marked impact on public finances and external debt.  Because of their poor
financial performance, enterprises have not been able to service their
debts, forcing the Government to meet debt service obligations and in some
cases cover operating deficits. Public resources allocated to the sector
grew to 17" of total government expenditures, reaching a peak of CFAF 12
billion in 1981. Between 1979 and 1983, annual operating losses of the PE
sector rose from; CFAF 2 billion to over CFAP 9 billion or from the
equivalent of 3 percent to 13 percent of total government revenues. As of
end 1983, the sector accounted for almost one half of Niger's foreign debt
and one-third of the outstanding domestic credit. The bulk of these
financial problems was accounted for by eight 1/ out of the thirteen main
PEs which were responsible for almost 100 percent of operating deficits, 90
percent of foreign debts, and over half of the outstanding domestic credit
of the sector.
3.        Institutional Framework.  A major reason for the poor performance
of the PE sector was the ill-defined institutional setup for PE management
1/   SONICHAR, OPVN, NITRA, NIGELEC, OFEDES, RINI, SNC and Air Niger.

of the sector.  Until recently, Governmentlenterprise relations were
characterized by excessive interference in day-to-day management.
Government control was exerted through technical ministries and the
Ministry of Finance, with technical ministries having considerable power on
key decisions (choice of director general, other high-level staff, and most
board members). All major financie- decisions (budgets, tariffs, pay
scales, investments, borrowings) haa to be approved a priori and reviewed a
posteriori by the Ministry of Finance. In addition to this double
tutelage, other ministries also intervened in other matters of enterprises
such as pricing, personnel, and procurement. To correct these
institutional weaknesses, the Government created a Ministry of State
Enterprises (MSE) in 1984 and two years later adopted the basic laws needed
to redefine government/enterprise relations, oriented more toward ex-post
control based upon performance review and increased autonomy of
enterprises.
4.        The MSE 4.s entrusted with two major functions:  general oversight
of the entire sector and technical supervisit  of 26 selected PEs, which
are deemed to require speedy actions of divestiture or rehabilitation. The
remaining 38 PEs are under technical supervision of about a dozen other
ministries. The most important elements of MSE's oversight function
incl"de: (i) formulation of sector-wide PE policies and specific objectives
for PEs; (ii) evaluation of overall performance; and (iii) support to PEs
for improving performance through implementa.ion of the performance-
contract process. Ultimately, MSE's functions of oversight and technical
supervision should be separated and the capacity of the various technical
ministries strengthened further to allow for effective management of the PE
sector. However, the MSE must continue to supervise the most important PEs
given the urgent need for corrective measures. At the same time, the
necessary tools and support systems must be developed to optimize the MSE's
effectiveness, while preparing for the transfer of PE supervision from the
MSE to relevant technical ministries.
5.        Government Reform Efforts.  Reflecting the sector's critical role
in Niger, the Government's medium-term adjustment pregram, supported by the
first SAL, includes a comprehensive reform of the parastatal sector with
measures introduced in three main areas: (i) revisions in incentive
policies; (ii) improvements in the legal and institutional framework for
the parastatal sector; and (iii) implementation of programs for the
rehabilitation, privatization and liquidation of individual enterprises.
As well, the basis for further reform of the sector, particularly regarding
debt settlement and financial restructuring, has been laid through
additional studies. These efforts at PE reform, supported by the IMF and
IDA, are showing the desired results. Since 1983, when the Government
first applied austerity measures to the parastatal sector, the financial
performance of public enterprises has markedly improved. Progress has in
particular been recorded in the rehabilitation programs of key enterprises,
such as NIGELEC, OFEDES, OPT, and SONICHAR.

6.        The Government of Niger now intends to extend the first phase of
its adjustment program through additional policy reforms in the PE sector
as well as in public resource management. Building upon the initiatives
already taken, the Government has formulated, in consultation with IDA, a
Public Enterprise Sector Adjustment Program (PESAP) covering the period
1987-90. The key areas of policy reform, affecting the PE sector are (i)
continued liberalization of pricing and trade policies at the same time as
encouraging private sector initiatives; (ii) refinement of the legal and
institutional framework for PEs, particularly to enhance accountability and
autonomy through the revision of company laws, introduction of performance
contracts, clarification of oversight and monitoring functions, and
amendment to controls regarding employment, investment, and procurement;
(iii) completion of the sector rationalization program including further
liquidation and privatization; (iv) continuation of the financial
restructuring program to settle PE debts and recapitalize enterprises; tv)
improvement of current procurement law,,, procedures and administration for
both Government and PEs; and (vi) extension of the program of enterprise
rehabilitation, adding two enterprises, OPVN and ORTN and reinforcing
on-going programs for RINI and BDRN. These measures will be supported by
IDA through the accompanying Public Enterprise Sector Adjustment Program.
7.        Proiect Description.  The proposed project will provide the
necessary technical skills, advisory services, and institutional support
for implementation of Government's PESAP. It will also continue the
process of improving the institutional base for the PE sector: within the
Government's oversight agencies, particularly MSE, and within the
enterprises themselves. The project will consist of: (a) general
institutional support to the MSE as the key PE policy and oversight agency;
(b) support for the timely implementation and monitoring of Government's
overall PE reform program; (c) development of additional reform measures;
(d) development of basic management tools for PEs and government
supervisory bodies; (e) improvement of current procurement laws, procedures
and administration policies for the public sector, including PEs; (f)
training of PE personnel and government officials; and (g) support for the
reorganization of ORTN. Each of these components is described below.
8.        (a) General Support to the MSE (US$1.17 million):  In order to
assist the MSE to formulate and implement the PE reform program, according
to a work program set out in Schedule 1, as well as to develop its capacity
as the central oversight agency, the project will finance: (a) a long-term
advisor (42 person-months); and (b) logistical and operational support.
The major function of the advisor will be to advise the MSE in all
technical and policy aspects of the reform program and coordinate the work
of short-term consultants. The project will also finance office equipment,
vehicles, and incremental operating, maintenance and other expenses for the
operation of a Project Unit set up in MSE. In addition, the project will
include provision for the salaries of additional support staff to be
assigned to that unit.  Finally, the project will finance annual audits of
the project as well as the PE Sector Adjustment Credit.

ANNEX I
Page 4 of 7
9.        (b) Support for Implementation and Monitoring of Reforms
(US$0.19 million): The project will finance 10 person-months of short-term
consultant services including: consultants to formulate and implement
detailed divestiture programs for selected enterprises; consultants to
redraft legal statutes of PEs in line with recently adopted model-statutes
and carry out an overall evaluation of the legal changes; consultants to
help implement the financial restructuring plan of the sector, assess the
impacts of reform measures on the financial position of PEs, and carry out
follow-up studies on the impact of privatization and other reform measures,
and consultants to meet other ad hoc needs on Issues arising during the
implementation of agreed reforms.
10.       (c) Support for Development of Additional Reform Measures
(US$0.60 million): In order to lay the basis for further reforms, the
project will finance the following studies (35 person-months): study of
performance-related PE remuneration structures; study of financial
controls; study of auditing/accounting norms; study of needs of enterprises
to develop MIS; review of roles and responsibilities of the MSE and
Ministry of Finance; and study of respective roles of the MSE and other
technical supervisory ministries. Terms of reference for these studies,
presented in the Project File, were agreed upon during negotiations.
11.       (d) Support for  Development of Management Tools
(US$0.29 million): In order to help the MSE develop and implement
appropriate management tools within the enterprises and to equip itself to
monitor and evaluate PE performance, the project will finance the
development of a simple yet effective management information system (4
person-months). Consultants (11 person-months) specialized in corporate
planning and performance contracts will also be financed under the project
with the objective of implementing a system of performance contracts
between the Government and at least ten key PEs. Audits of selected PEs
will also be financed valued at US$80,000. Terms of reference for these
consultants are provided in the Project File.
12.       (e) Improvement of the Procurement Policies and Procedures
(US$0.10 million): In order to improve current procurement for both the
public service and PEs, the project will finance consulting services (5
person-months) for: (a) review of the existing procurement code; (b)
preparation of a procurement manual and standard documents; and (c)
organization of seminars on procurement for Government officials and PE
managers.  Training 'ill also be provided for procurement officers in the
Central Procurement Agency.
13.       (f) Training (US$1.88 million): The project will provide a
comprehensive training program, equivalent to approximately 1,400
person-weeks of training, aimed at building up local capabilities for
improving PE performance. The training program, summarized in Schedule 2,
will address primarily PE executives and senior officers, and Government
officials responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of PE performance,
covering the following core areas: corporate planning and performance
contracts; setting objectives and targets; project cycle; financial
management, audit and control; management information systems; and

Page 5 of 7
personnel planning and administration. The courses will be offered by the
National Management Training Center (CNPG) with help from ILO. About 250
participants will be trained through courses and seminars given at CNPG
over a two-year period program. Lastly, the training program includes a
number of ancillary and support actions such as regional conferences,
scholarships and the provision of specialized advisory and coordinating
personnel.
14.       (g)  Restructuring of ORTN (US$0.70 million): The project will
assist the Government in formulating and implementing a managerial and
organizational reform program for ORTN which will be prepared by December
1987. Technical assistance of 42 person-months will be provided to ORTN
over the next three years to strengthen management and accounting, to
revise its legal framework, and to formulate and negotiate the performance
contract for 1988-91.
15.       (h) Subprojects (US$0.25 million):  Additional activities within
the objectives of the project, to be identified during the execution by the
Borrower and approved by IDA, may be financed as subprojects.
Coordination with Other Donors
16.        The project is designed to help the Government to more
effectively implement the activities of other donors and other IDA-financed
projects in the PE sector. In particular, the above training component
will complement the institutional support provided to CNPG so far by ILO.
In addition, the project will complement ongoing efforts of other donors to
rehabilitate specific enterprises such as SONICHAR and OPT by CCCE, and
OPVN by FED, USAID and Germany. Finally, the project will coordinate its
support with that provided under other IDA-financed projects for NIGELEC,
ONAHA, RINI, and BDRN, as well as a proposed project for SNDE (water supply
company) which is currently being prepared.
B. Proiect Administration and Implementation
17.       Organization and Management.  The MSE will have overall
responsibility for coordinating and implementing the proposed project. A
project management unit called the Public Enterprise Reform Unit (PERU),
created within the MSE, will be responsible for the coordination of project
activities and routine project administration. The PERU will be staffed
with a Unit Chief and five local staff, together with an experienced
advisor. The personnel of the other departments of the MSE (about 20 staff
as of early 1987) will be called upon to participate in the formulation and
implementation of specific measures as required. The MSE's annual work
program under the project wculd be approved by IDA by December of each year
and no future commitment made unless that program has been agreed.
18.       The project unit is to be fully equipped and staffed under the
project. Appointment of the project manager, satisfactory to IDA, was made
in mid-1986. With the PPF, the PE advisor has been hired initially for 18
months. Terms of reference and related documents for the long-term

Page 6 or 7
advisor, acceptable to IDA, have been prepared (see the Project File).
Consultants will work undsr the authority of the Minister of State
Enterprise and closely with MSE staff in the execution of their
assignments.
19.       Restructuring of ORTN.  Agreement on the specific managerial and
organizational reforms for ORTN, acceptable to IDA, will be a condition of
disbursement of the ORTN component. The MSE will be responsible for
monitoring these programs in close coordination with the management of ORTN
which will have responsibility for execution. ORTN will establish a small
task force to coordinate with the MSE the formulation and implementation of
its reform program.
20.       Inter-Ministerial Coordination.  In carrying out its task, the
MSE will collaborate with other ministries, especially the concerned
technical ministries and ministries of Finance and Planning. Many of its
areas of interest, for example, salaries, legal statutes, investment, and
financial control, concern other ministries which are directly responsible
for those matters. Coordination and ensuring the involvement of theset
ministries is, therefore, an important part of the MSE's operations. At
present, the Interministerial Committee, created in the context of the
Structural Adjustment Program and comprising the six ministries of State
Enterprise, Finance, Planning, Agriculture, Mining and Energy, Civil
Service, and Commerce, Industry and Transport, as well as the Director of
the Prime Minister's Office, and the Secretary General of the Presidency
ensures the coordination among ministries with respect to important PE
reform measures, based upon proposals prepared and submitted by the MSE.
Close coordination between ministries will be sought through (a)
involvement of other ministries in working groups to develop specific
proposals (for example, salary study); (b) ad-hoc committees to review
enterprise reform plans (for example, OPVN, ORTN, OFEDES, NIGELEC); and (c)
participation of other ministries in preparation and approval of
performance contracts.
21.       Implementation Plan.  A summary of the project's key activities
is presented in Schedule C. Implementation of the main activities is
anticipated to take about three years with some activities extending beyond
that. The proje.t is thus expected to be fully completed by the end of
June 1992.
22.       Procurement. The goods and services to be financed under the
project will be procured in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA as
summarized in Schedule B. Training, technical assistance and consultancy
services will be procured in accordance with IDA's guidelines. Office
furniture and equipment, vehicles, maintenance and operating expenses
valued under US$100,000 will be procured mainly following local competitive
bidding (LCB) procedures which are satisfactory to IDA. Local shopping
will be allowed for items of less than US$20,000 up to a cumulative amount
of US$100,000.
23.       Disbursement.  In line with the average disbursement profile for
technical assistance projects in the Vestern Africa Region, the project is



- 15 -
ANNEX I
Page 7 of 7
forecasted to be disbursed over seven years. However, the Government is
targeting to complete disbursement in a much shorter period, reflecting the
fact that the bulk of the project is composed of short-term technical
assistance and training to be disbursed during the first three-years of the
project.
24.       All disbursements would be subject to prior IDA approval except
for contracts of less than US$50,000 equivalent, as well as training,
salary premia and operating costs of PERU which will be made against
statements of expenditure (SOE). No disbursement will be made for any
subproject without IDA's prior approval of that subproject. The Director
of PERU will have the responsibility for the preparation of withdrawal
applications.
25.       Revolving Fund.  To expedite implementation, the Government would
establish a Special Account in CFA francs in a commercial bank as a
Revolving Fund for IDA's contribution. An initial deposit of US$250,000
equivalent (CFAF 75 million) will be made from the proceeds of the proposed
Credit upon effectiveness. The minimum replenishment application should be
US$100,000. For contracts o-f less than US$50,000 equivalent, reimbursement
will be made against statements of expenditures (SOE). Budgetary provision
for local costs will be inscribed in the annual operating budgets for the
IMSE, starting in FY1987/88, as a condition of credit effectiveness.
26.       Project Preparation Facility.  A PPF advance of US$500,000 was
approved on October 23, 1985, to fund a feasibility study of SNC (cement
plant), a cross-debt study, services of an advisor to MSE, and equipment
and vehicles for PERU as well as its operating expenses. An additional PPF
advance of US$250,000 was approved on August 20, 1986, to finance a
managerial audit of ORTN and an early start of a priority training program
aimed at sensitizing Government officials and PE managers. Additional PPF
resources of US$400,000 have been requested to fund priority studies prior
to credit effectiver.ess and continue the services of the PE advisor to MSE.
27.       Accounts and Audits.  The MSE will establish separate accounts to
be managed by the project unit, in accordance with accepted accounting
principles, to record all project expenditures and to maintain records on
all commitments, reimbursements and the status of project funds. Agreement
has been obtained that independent auditors acceptable to IDA would audit
these accounts annually in accordance with appropriate auditing principles
and in such detail as IDA may request. Audit reports will be due six months
after the end of the fiscal year.
28.       Reporting and Monitoring.  MSE will be required to submit
quarterly reports on the progress of project implementation, policy reforms
and institutional changes, and implementation of the performance-contracts.
The scope and detail of these reports were agreed upon with Government
during negotiations. In addition, MSE will prepare an annual report
summarizing progress in all key areas of the reform. At the completion of
the project, MSE will prepare the project completion report.

TRAINING
1.        The training program i. designed to fill the gaps in the skills
required for implementing the PE sector reformst corporate planning and
objective-setting, performance monitoring and evaluation, financial audit
and control, management information, and related subjects. It will also
strengthen more traditional skills such as general management, accounting
and personnel administration whose weakness has in the past contributed to
poor PE performance. The program is primarily directed at technical and
other middle-level personnel, both in PEs and Government, whose work will
be crucial over the next ircv years in rationalizing the sector and in
bringing about needed improvements in efficiency of PEs.
2.        The program will also contribute to building up the capability
and experience of a local management training institution founded in 1985
(CNPG), which has since then received technical assistance from ILO. ILO
will continue its assistance to CNPG through an arrangement by which
Government of Niger will name CNPG as the executing agency for the training
program, who in turn will call for ILO support through a special agreement.
ILO's support to CNPG will diminish over the life of the program so that by
its fourth and last year, the execution of the program will be carried out
solely by CNPG, whose personnel should be adequately trained by that time.
3.        Over its two-year duration, the program will provide about 1,400
training-weeks for about 250 participants through seminars, workshops,
study trips, and other practice-oriented training formats. It will also
award several scholarships abroad and will provide for participation in
technical regional conferences. Its total cost will be US$1,880,000 plus
contingencies.
