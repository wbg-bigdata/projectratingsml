REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN AND A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC FOR THE BALIKH IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
and a proposed development credit to the Syrian Arab Republic for the equiv-
alent of US$63 million and US$10 million respectively to help finance the
Balikh irrigation project., The loan would have a term of 30 years, includ-
ing 8 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum. The credit
would be on standard IDA terms.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Syria"
(R73-110, May 21, 1973) was distributed to the Executive Directors in May 1973.
A Bank mission visited Syria in November 1973 to review the impact of the Octo-
ber hostilities on the economy and on ongoing projects. An economic mission
is scheduled to visit Syria in March 1974. A country data sheet is attached
as Annex I.
3.        Since the attainment of independence in 1946, Syria has had numerous
changes in regime which resulted in a shift of power from groups of landowners,
traders and industrialists to a rising class of officers, technicians, and
civil servants, and a shift of the economy from a laissez-faire system to
a largely publicly owned and regulated one. The Baath Socialist Party --
the ruling party since 1963 -- has provided substantial continuity of em-
phasis on economic and social development policies, which have prevailed
in spite of Government changes and external tensions. During the 1960's
an agrarian reform was completed, with redistribution of land to large num-
bers of formerly landless peasants. In November 1970 General Assad came to
power and assumed the duties of President of the Republic. His regime has
been characterized by a balance of firmness and conciliation in domestic
policies; economic pragmatism; search for a better defined role for the
private sector in the centrally regulated economy; and diversification in
foreign economic relations. In March 1973, a permanent constitution was
approved by referendum. General elections of the legislature in May 1973
gave the majority of the vote and seats to the Baath Socialist Party. A na-
tional referendum reconfirmed President Assad for a seven-year term. After
the October conflict, the Government has been seeking a settlement with Israel
based on the return to the pre-1967 borders.



- 2 -
4.        In the last decade, Syria has achieved diversification of produc-
tion and rapid growth under fairly stable prices. GDP increased in 1960-72
by about 7 percent per year in real terms, compared to 3.4 percent during
1953-60. The most dynamic sectors were manufacturing, transport, communica-
tions and services during the whole decade, agriculture in the early 1960's
and oil production and oil transit during the later 1960's. A substantial
increase in oil transit rates in 1971, new factories entering into production
in 1972, and an improved business climate, also contributed to a GDP increase
of about 11 percent annually in real terms in 1971 and 1972. During the re-
cent hostilities, part of the country's productive capacity was damaged, In-
cluding the Homs refinery, power plants, ports, oil pipeline terminals and
some industrial plants. However, prompt action by the Government and grant
assistance by the other Arab countries for reconstruction are likely to
contain the slow-down in economic activity resulting from the power and fuel
shortage. GDP probably declined slightly in 1973, as a result of both the
hostilities and a severe drought in lat:e 1972/early 1973 but,-barring a re-
sumption of hostilities, economic activity should come back to normal by
mid-1974.
5.        Industry has been regarded by the Government as the spearhead of
the country's development during the last decade. A large and diversified
investment program contributed to a rapid growtli of the sector of about 9
percent per year between 1966 and 1971. In the latter year, the sector
accounted for 19 percent of GDP and about 8 percent of employment. Agri-
culture, however, remains the most important sector, accounting for almost
one-quarter of GDP and two-thirds of employment. Wide fluctuations in agri-
cultural production primarily caused by variations in rainfall are a major
unsettling factor in growth. Employment problems remain serious, as growth
of direct employment opportunities has been limited by the low labor require-
ments of the oil sector and other industries and the long gestation of most
public investments. Agriculture absorbed most of the increase of active
population (around 3 percent per annum) during the sixties, as emigration
to nearby countries provided limited relief, and underemployment increased.
6.        Resource allocation to economic development has been consistent
withi the priority needs of the economy, and a large public investment effort
has been a main factor of dynamism. M4easures have been taken to strengthen
the country's transport infrastructure, to interconnect and expand its power
system, to expand its industrial basis, and develop its limited petroleum
and mineral resources.   Agriculture, irrigation and land reclamation received
about 16 percent of public investment in 1960-1970, and the construction of
a major dam on the Euphrates set the basis for lessening the dependence of
agriculture on weather conditions through irrigation.
7.        In spite of continued austerity of non-military current public ex-
penditure, public revenues were insufficient to meet the requirements of a
large investment progran. after 1967. In 1969, the Government took several
measures to improve tax assessment and collection and increased somewhat the
rates of profit taxes, though there is still scope for structural improvements
in the tax system. Savings of public enterprises rose substantially and fi-
nanced an increasing part of public investment. However, with modest gross
national savings and with low net external financing, domestic borrowing from



-3 -
the banking system, mainly from the Central Bank, increased considerably to
finance the current budget deficit as well as part of the investments. In
1970, the Government took measures to encourage private savings and limit
credit expansion, including higher interest on deposits, saving certificate
issues and restrictions on credit overdrafts. As a result, the growth rate
of money supply decelerated to 6.4 percent in 1971 (compared to 15 percent
per year during 1966-70) and demand deposits increased by 19 percent.
8.        After a period of small overall surpluses, the balance of payments
has been in deficit and net foreign assets declined every year since 1968.
Increasing trade deficits were only partly offset by rising receipts from
services, mainly oil pipeline dues representing 28 percent of total export
earnings in 1971. Recent liberalization policies and devaluation of the
Syrian pound have resulted in capital repatriation and a better investment
climate in the private sector. In 1972, exports increased substantially
(particularly wheat, petroleum and textiles) due to a record harvest and
the 1971 currency realignment. There was also a marked increase in official
grants from Arab countries ($42 million during January-September 1972 com-
pared with $21 million in 1971), and a jump in net private capital inflow
(from $1 million in 1970 to $75 million in 1971 and $23 million in January-
September 1972). Nevertheless, the situation remained tight due to the delay
of payments of oil transit dues from Iraq after the 1972 nationalization of
the Iraq Petroleum Co. (IPC) pipeline. This situation improved markedly with
back payments of about $40 million under an agreement with Iraq in January
1973, which also increased oil transit dues by about 50%.
9.        The long-term prospects for the balance of payments are good, mainly
due to the 1973 oil transit agreement, to rising quantities of oil exported
and the recent oil price increases. In the short run, however, the impact
of reconstruction efforts and increases in import prices will not lead to
rapid improvements. Oil exports are expected to increase from 4 million
tons in 1972 to 5.2 million tons in 1974 and 12 million tons in 1977. The
recent price increases are expected to bring the average price of the low-
quality Syrian crude from $2 to about $6 per barrel, resulting in an addi-
tional revenue of about $165 million in 1974 and - assuming no further de-
creases in prices - $336 million in 1977. Transit dues for Iraqi oil are
not linked to the level of oil prices under the 1973 transit agreement
which is not due for renegotiation until 1976; transit revenues may be of
the order of $100 million in 1974 if pumping is resumed at the 1972 level.
The Government has indicated that the largest part of the imports of military
equipment due to the recent war are financed by grants from Arab countries.
The financing of the supplementary import requirements of capital goods and
refined oil products due to the extensive war damage would offset in part
the expected increase in export revenues from oil. Successive revaluations
of the Syrian pound vis a vis the dollar (from LS 4.32 per $1 to LS 4.05
in February 1973 and LS 3.85 in July 1973) are unlikely to affect balance
of payments prospects, since at the same time the value of the Syrian pound
decreased in terms of the currencies of the major trading partners of the
country.



- 4 -
10.       The impact of the recent hostilities on the economy is likely to
result in a growth rate of GDP at about 6% per year during the Third Plan
period (1971-1975), instead of 8.2% expected in the Plan. The investment
proaram of the Third Plan ($2.1 billion, or double the amount of the Second
Plan) still seems achievable. I.n the longer term, the Government's continued
emphasis on investment should make it possible to sustain a 7 percent annual
growth. Prospects for continuing fast growth in oil, manufacturing and elect-
ricity are favorable and growth in private investment may well continue.
11.       Syria, however, will require more external aid in the. medium term
and more technical assistance and guidance on institution building than it
can obtain from its present sources if it is to reach the above targets. The
bulk of Syria's external borrowing was concentrated in 1965-67, with gross
official capital inflows averaging some $55 million per year since 1965 and
a peak of almost $80 million in 1967. Reported non-military external debt
outstanding and disbursed increased from an estimated $100 million in 1963
to about $230 million at the end of 1971. Debt including undisbursed has
risen from about $258 million at the end of 1970 to $325 millicin at the end
of 1971 and about $512 million at the end of 1972, mainly to USSR, East
Germany, Kuwait, Czechoslovakia and Saudi Arabia. The total held by IDA
amounted to $37.3 million at the end of January 1974. Commitments increased
substantially in 1971, mainly from East Germany, Kuwait, USSR and Japan.
Requirements of gross official external assistance are expected to rise
from about $50 million in 1971 to about $80 million in 1975 and average
about $100 million a year thereafter.   Existing sources of external assis-
tance are expected to continue lending at about the present levels, and the
balance will have to be found from multilateral alid new bilateral sources.
The Bank Group's share in the total external non-military debt and debt serv-
ice is expected to remain comparatively small. Debt service pciyments exclud-
ing military debts, about which information is not available, amounted to
13 percent of exports of goods and services in 1971-72, and are estimated
at 11 percent in 1973. A debt service ratio of the same magnit:ude is ex-
pected also over the next five years, thanks to a rapid growth of export
receipts.
12.       The proposed loan would be-the first to be made to Syria by the
Bank. Syria's recent growth, with substantially improved expor-t prospects
and generally favorable outlook for further growth, adequate public invest-
ment allocation, recent improvement in economic management and prompt action
for reconstruction indicate a satisfactory performance. A considerable im-
provement in the long term prospects of Syria's balance of payments indicates
a capacity to service substantial new borrowings. Nevertheless, in view of
the low per capita income (about $290 in 1972), serious underemployment, vul-
nerability of agriculture to weather conditions, and pressure on the balance
of payments in the next few years, Syria should continue for the time being
to seek part of its borrowings on concessional terms.
13.       Following Iraq's nationalization of the facilities of the Iraq
Petroleum Company (IPC), Syria nationalized the section of the IPC pipeline
running through its territory, in June 1972, with a provision ior compensa-
tion. At the time of nationalization, the company asked the Government to
submit to arbitration, pursuant to the original convention, the question of



Syria's right to nationalize the properties. While reasserting its willing-
ness to compensate IPC, the Government questioned the company's interpreta-
tion of the arbitration clause and its applicability to nationalization as
such. This led to a deadlock on the issue of arbitration rather than a dis-
cussion of compensation. Since then, Government officials have informed our
staff on various occasions that the Syrian Government was prepared to discuss
the amount of compensation with the company and this position has been re-
layed to IPC and its shareholders. The issue has also been complicated by
the existence of substantial counterclaims on the part of the Government
related to past IPC dues. While this delay in actual negotiations on com-
pensation may therefore be understandable, the Bank will continue to follow
this matter closely.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SYRIA
14.       Syria has to date received three IDA credits, two for highways,
totalling $22.3 million, and one for water supply, amounting to $15 million.
The first highway project is about to be completed satisfactorily, although
it had a slow start. The credit for the second highways project became ef-
fective in February 1973; the water supply credit became effective in February
1974. Though Syria is a member of the Corporation, IFC has made no invest-
ments there in the past. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits
as of January 31, 1974, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
15.       Until recently, lack of familiarity with Bank Group procedures and
reluctance to accept Bank rather than IDA terms have prevented Syria from
obtaining assistance from the Bank Group on the scale appropriate to its
economic performance and its development needs. Recently, the Bank Group has
established a fruitful dialogue with the Government which resulted in a better
understanding of Bank Group requirements and the request of financing for
several projects. The Government's increased emphasis on sound economic ma-
nagement provides the Bank Group with an appropriate setting to make a meaning-
ful contribution to economic development. Syria's relatively developed admi-
nistrative structure, adequate public investment allocation and increasing
interest in cooperating with the Bank Group should make it possible for it to
absorb larger amounts of Bank Group financing than in the past. In line with
the needs of the economy and the Third Plan investment strategy, the Bank
Group plans to focus on (i) irrigation and soil improvement in the Euphrates
basin, to increase agricultural employment, production and exports while
reducing food imports and the dependency on weather fluctuations; (ii) insti-
tution building in the public sector, by assisting water supply, sewerage,
transportation and power projects of high priority; and (iii) rural devel-
opment schemes. Negotiations were recently completed on a project for the
provision of urgently needed power facilities. A project for drainage in
the lower Euphrates is being prepared with assistance from the FAO/IBRD
Cooperative Program and is likely to result in a lending operation in FY76.
Studies for the preparation of this project would be financed from the pro-
posed loan and credit. The Cooperative Program is also assisting in the
identification of a livestock project for FY76. Other lending operations



whose preparation is advanced are a second power project (steam--electric gen-
eration) and a sewerage project for the cities of Damascus, Homrs and Hama.
Studies for the latter are financed from Credit 401 (Damascus Water Supply
Project).
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN SYRIA
16.       In recent years, agriculture generated almost one quarter of GDP
and two-thirds of export proceeds. Nearly two thirds of direct employment
were in agriculture, in addition to a substantial number of workers employed
in industries processing agricultural products. However, the growth of agri-
cultural production during the sixties, at only 2.4 percent per annum, did
not keep pace with the increase in active population, and underemployment
in agriculture increased.
17.       The country's unexploited potential for agricultural development
is substantial, particularly through irrigation. Only 0.5 million ha are
irrigated, out of a total of about 6 million ha of cultivated land, while
production in rainfed lands--mainly cereals, cotton, olives, fruits, veg-
etables and sheep--fluctuates widely from year to year because of variations
in annual rainfall. As a consequence, the economy depends heavily on live-
stock and cereals imports during drought years, at prices higher than the ex-
port prices during the favorable years. The waters of the Euphrates River,
to be eventually shared with the other riparians in a proportion still to be
defined, have a large, yet undeveloped potential for irrigation.
18.       Since the early sixties the Government included among the major
elements of its development strategy the improvement of income distribution
in agriculture and the development of irrigation and intensive cultivation
with a view to increasing agricultural employment opportunities, incomes,
production and exports while reducing import requirements and the dependency
on weather fluctuations. The agrarian reform was extensive, involving the
redistribution of about one third of the country's cultivated land. The
construction of the dam on the Euphrates river set the basis for a compre-
hensive regional development in the northern part of the country.
19.       By 1970, some of the main constraints to the growth of production
during the sixties were eased by the completion of land redistribution, by
increasing credit, use of fertilizers and basic mechanization, and by in-
troducing high yield varieties of wheat and new disease resistanit varieties
of cotton. A sustained effort is still required, however, to brLng to yield
the measures introduced so far and the investment in the Euphrates dam.
20.       The Third Plan 1971-1975 gives high priority to agricuLtural devel-
opment, with the allocation of about 35 percent (LS 2.2 billion) of public
investment to agriculture, mostly in the Euphrates basin. Besides the as-
sistance from the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program, Syria receives assistance
from UNDP in the development of livestock, rural cooperatives and integrated
rural development. Increased knowledge of -- and assistance to --- Syria's
agriculture are among the main objectives of the Bank Group's economic work
and lending operations, together with employment problems.



PART IV - THE PROJECT
21.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Balikh Irrigation Project -
Syrian Arab Republic" (No. 312a SYR dated February 28, 1974) is being circu-
lated separately to the Executive Directors. A loan, credit and project
summary is attached as Annex III. Maps of the project area are also attached.
Feasibility studies were prepared by Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners (UK),
UNDP and the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Programme in collaboration with the General
Administration for Development of the Euphrates Basin (GADEB), the Government
agency responsible for the project. A Bank technical mission in March-April
1973, consisting of Messrs. Ellsperman and Rippon (consultants), reviewed
the engineering aspects of the project, particularly the feasibility of canal
construction in the gypsiferous soils of the project area. The project was
appraised in the field in May 1973. Negotiations for the proposed loan and
credit were held in Washington in February 1974. The Government delegation
was led by His Excellency Munir Wannous, Minister of the Euphrates Dam.
22.       The proposed project consists of a 41,000 ha irrigation and rural
development scheme in the basin of the Balikh River, a tributary of the
Euphrates River, and studies for the rehabilitation of agriculture in the
lower Euphrates Valley. The irrigation and rural development scheme would
enable the development of irrigated cotton, cereals, vegetables, fruit, forage
and other crops, integrated with livestock, in an area with well suited soils
and arid climate. At present, only about 2,800 ha are under partial irriga-
tion and 20,000 ha under low yield and unreliable dry-land cereal farming
extremely vulnerable to variations in rainfall. The project works include
a main supply canal; an irrigation distribution system including five pumps
and surface drainage facilities; and access roads. In addition, the project
would provide on-farm development including water-courses and land shaping;
water supply facilities and buildings for schools, clinics and community
activities for 28 settlement villages; equipment and machinery for mech-
anized farming, extension services, operation and maintenance; consultant
services for project supervision and the formation of a new agricultural
extension service and for the establishment of a complete operation plan
for the Euphrates dam reservoir (Lake Assad); and materials for bilharzia
and malaria control. An important feature of the scheme is that it would
provide employment and settlement for about 7,500 small farm families, in-
cluding about 3,000 of 8,600 families that will need to be resettled on
agricultural land as a result of the filling of the reservoir at Thawra.
The balance of 5,600 families will be resettled on a 19,600 ha pilot proj-
ect in the Balikh Basin which the Government plans to complete in 1974 with
financing from its own resources and technical assistance from UNDP.
23.       The proposed studies would assist the Government in carrying out
its programs of rehabilitation of existing irrigated zones in the lower
Euphrates Valley, which at present are affected by serious salinity and
drainage problems. A FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program mission visited Syria
in September 1973 and identified the proposed program of the studies, which
comprises a master plan for the rehabilitation of agriculture in an area of



-8-
about 200,000 ha from Halabie-Zelabie to Abou Kemal at the Syria-Iraq border,
and a feasibility study, detailed designs and contract documents for a first
stage rehabilitation project covering about 55,000 ha of the above area on
the right bank of the river.
Interests of Riparians
24.       Water would be supplied to the Balikh irrigation scheme from the
Euphrates river, an international waterway which flows through the terri-
tories of Turkey, Syria and Iraq.   Only about 50 percent of the waters of
the Euphrates are presently diverted by the three riparians, almost exclu-
sively for irrigation. The total net diversion from the EuphraLtes required
for the Balikh scheme as proposed to the Bank would be at full development,
in 1986, about 0.5 billion m3 of water, equivalent to 2 percent: of the aver-
age river flow at the Syria-Iraq boundary, or only about 3 percent of the
average flow of the Euphrates presently unused.   In a drought year, with a
10% frequency of occurrence, the corresponding percentages would increase
to 3% and 7% respectively under the reasonable assumption that some 10-15%
of river storage would be released to augment the river flow. After making
allowance for a reduction of water use caused by the cessation of irrigation
in the area flooded by Lake Assad and additional diversions to the ongoing
pilot project, the incremental net diversion for irrigation attributable to
the project would be about 0.3 to 0.4 billion m3.
25.       Discussions between the three riparians on the sharing of the waters
of the Euphrates have taken place intermittently since 1962. Meetings are
continuing, but it will take some time till agreement is reached. The Bank
has actively encouraged the riparians to discuss a long-term water sharing
agreement and, in June, 1973, informed the Turkish and Iraqi Governments of
its interest in the Balikh project. The Turkish authorities have not raised
any objections. Iraqi authorities had initially asked the Bank to postpone
financing the project until negotiations among the riparians lead to an agree-
ment. These negotiations are complex since they involve both the long-term
problem of equitable sharing of the Euphrates waters and a short-term problem
relating to the filling of the new large reservoirs at Keban, in Turkey, and
Thawra, in Syria, and of the existing Habbaniah reservoir in Iraq. Too rapid
filling of the reservoirs could negatively affect irrigation in Iraq, but
too long delays in filling would postpone electric power production from
the Keban and the Euphrates dams and, in the extreme case, agricultural
production from the Balikh project. Negotiations on this short-term problem
have made good progress. Iraqi and Syrian delegations met in Damascus, with
the agreement of the Turkish authorities, in November 1973 and agreed on a
filling schedule for the critical low flow season ending in February 1974.
Since the conclusion of this agreement, the Iraqi authorities have not pur-
sued their request to postpone the project. The riparians plan to continue
their discussions to agree on subsequent stages of the filling. The Syrian
Government has stated in a letter to the Bank Group that it will continue
to use its best efforts to reach agreement with Iraq and Turkey on the use
of the Euphrates waters and on the filling schedules of the reservoirs at
Thawra and Keban. The Syrian Government has also stated to the Bank Group



- 9 -
that even in the absence of such agreement it intends to operate the reservoir
at Thawra in a manner which would assure that the requirements of the down-
stream riparian, Iraq, are reasonably covered, provided that reasonable re-
leases are made from the Keban reservoir.
26.       I am satisfied that the proposed project is not harmful to the
interests of the other riparians since the orders of magnitude of additional
water uses by the project are small and, taking into account the present level
of diversions in Syria, the additional consumptive use for the present project
would be well within the allotment to Syria under any equitable apportionment
of Euphrates waters. Considering the satisfactory progress of negotiations
and the assurances given to the Bank Group by the Syrian Government, neither
the project nor the riparians' interests are likely to suffer during the fill-
ing periods. I have concluded that there are not sufficient grounds for de-
laying the proposed project.
Project Execution
27.       The irrigation scheme is planned to be carried out in 1974-1981 by
the General Administration for the Development of the Euphrates Basin (GADEB),
a semi-autonomous agency of the Ministry of the Euphrates Dam, and would be
under the supervision of an interministerial coordinating committee chaired
by the Prime Minister. GADEB, established in 1968, is responsible for the
integrated regional development in the Euphrates Basin and has acquired
expertise in planning of resettlement and development, in supervision of
construction of irrigation facilities and resettlement villages, and in
research activities for the pilot project. Nonetheless, GADEB staff needs
strengthening. Adequate numbers of agricultural and engineering staff would
be provided during the period of project development. An intensive training
program for GADEB staff has been planned, including overseas training pro-
vided by UNDP projects. A number of senior officers from the Ministry of
Agriculture would be seconded to GADEB to provide in-service training of
new graduates recruited for settlement and agricultural development work.
The Government would make available funds to the existing Agricultural Bank
to cover the increased credit requirements of the farmers in the project
area.
Consultants
28.       Detailed designs by consultants are underway and contract documents
for the first phases of construction have been substantially completed. Un-
usual construction, operation and management problems created by the presence
of gypsiferous soils in the project area demand the experience of other spe-
cialists, and GADEB is finalizing a contract with general consultants to
assist in reviewing the work of the design consultants, supervision of con-
struction, and development of operation and maintenance procedures for the
project. The general consultants would also assist GADEB in the setting up
of extension services, agricultural machinery services and application of
improved methods of soil management and irrigation for the project. The



- 10 -
studies for the operation of the reservoir of the Euphrates dam and for the
rehabilitation of agriculture in the lower Euphrates Valley would be carried
out in 1974-77 by consultants selected in accordance with Bank Group's proce-
dures. In view of the urgency of the agricultural rehabilitation studies,
the Ministry of the Euphrates Dam has advertised on a wide international
basis for the pre-selection of consulting firms in September-October 1973.
Cost Estimates
29.       Total project cost, excluding import duties and taxes, is estimated
to be about LS 656 million (about $170 million), including LS 225 million
($58 million) of contingencies. Physical contingencies vary between 10-20
percent, but for most work items are 20 percent, due to difficult soil condi-
tions in the project area. Contingencies for price escalation for civil works
and equipment have been allowed, respectively, at 12 and 9 percerLt in 1974;
10 and 7 percent in 1975; and 8 and 5 percent in 1976 through 1980. The
estimated foreign cost component of the project, including contirLgencies,
is $73 million. Details of the cost estimates are given in Annex III.
Financing Plan and Recovery of Costs
30.       The Bank Group would finance the estimated foreign cosi: component
of the project, equivalent to 43 percent of the total cost. Local currency
expenditures would be financed by the Government of Syria. The financing plan
would be as follows:
US$                % of
(million)       Project cost
IBRD loan                          63                 37
IDA credit                          10                 6
Government                         97                 57
Total                         170               100
31.       Project charges would be levied on the beneficiaries in order to
recover full operation and maintenance costs of the irrigation system which
would serve the project area and full investment costs allocated to the pro-
ject, without interest, within the project lifetime of 35 years. Cost recovery
would amount to 32% of the total cost, assuming a discount rate of 10%. The
cost to the farmers would rise to about 35% of their annual net farm income
by the third year of agricultural development. Considering the modest level
of farm income per capita even after execution of the project (LS 940, equi-
valent to about $245, after payment of project charges), the indicated levels
of project charges and the corresponding level of subsidy to farmers appear
appropriate to develop the project while adequately maintaining the farmers'
incentives.



Procurement Arrangements
32.       Goods and services financed by the Bank Group would be procured
after international competitive bidding under the Bank's guidelines, except
for: i) construction of village community buildings, water supplies and
administrative buildings, which would be awarded in small contracts after
local competitive bidding; these works, amounting to about $2.5 million are
not suitable for international bidding because they are scattered and their
construction is spread over long periods; and (ii) contracts for imported
equipment, materials and supplies not exceeding $5,000 each and an aggregate
amount of $100,000 which would be procured in accordance with the procedures
of the borrower. Major civil works costing about $149 million would be tend-
ered in three contracts. Consultants will be responsible for specifications,
analysis of bids and recommendations for award of contracts. T'he Government
has not requested a preferential margin for local manufacturers of equipment
in the evaluation of bids.
Disbursement Arrangements and Retroactive Financing
33.       Withdrawals from the Bank loan account would be made only after the
proceeds of the IDA credit are fully withdrawn or committed. Disbursements
would be made in 1974-1982 to finance:
(i) 45% of civil works contracts, representing the estimated
foreign exchange component.
(ii) the CIF cost of imported equipment and materials, or 75% of
the cost of equipment procured in Syria representing the es-
timated foreign exchange component.
(iii) the foreign exchange costs of consultant services.
It is proposed that the IDA credit finance retroactively up to $150,000 of
expenditures for general consultants' services, which are expected to be made
after January 1, 1974. Any undisbursed amount of the proposed loan and credit
will be cancelled.
Economic Rate of Return and Justification
34.       At full development, the annual gross value of agricultural produc-
tion is expected to reach about $26 million, nearly 17 times the output
without the project. The employment effect would also be important, as the
project would provide support for about 7,500 farm families (about 43,000
people). The economic rate of return is estimated to be about 11%, besides
significant social benefits and institution building. The project would
provide resettlement and employment for small farm families displaced by
the Thawra dam; strengthen the administrative framework of the responsible
Ministry; improve the farmers' living conditions; contribute to reducing
income disparities between rural and urban areas and, thus, the incentives
to urban migration. At full development, net annual farm income per capita



- 12 -
in the project area after payment of project charges (about LS 940) would
be close to the average national income and above the average national farm
income (LS 550-650 per capita).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
35.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Syrian Arab Republic and the
Bank, the draft Development Credit Agreement between the Syrian Arab Republic
and the Association, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, the Recommendation
of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the. Articles
of Agreement of the Association, and the text of draft resolutions approv-
ing the proposed loan and credit are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. Ratification of the agreements by the legislature
is required under the laws of the Syrian Arab Republic and, owing to the
lengthy legislative process involved, a period of six months has been al-
lowed after the date of signature for the fulfillment of the conditions of
effectiveness. Otherwise, the draft Loan and Credit Agreements conform to
the normal pattern for irrigation projects.
36.       I am satisfied that the proposed Loan and Development Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
37.        In formulating this proposal, it has not been possible to take
full account of the consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices.
However, available information indicates that the proposed loan and credit
remain fully justified.
38.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan
and development credit.

Credit 46 - First Highway Project; US$8.5 million Credit of December 24,
1963; Closing Date: December 31, 1974.
This project includes improvements of the 530 km Damascus-Homs-Hama-
Aleppo-Raqqa highway linking the capital city with the country's major
productive centers. Construction started only in 1968 due to inadequate
engineering studies and the need to completely redesign the highway. As
a result of this delay, the original closing date of December 31, 1968
was postponed twice up to December 31, 1973. Works are now well under-
way and are expected to be completed by early 1974. However, to allow
for longer than expected time for delivery of maintenance equipment
included in this project and already ordered, the closing date has been
postponed for a third time to December 31, 1974, the current date.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

ment in the Ministry of Communications. Project construction is expect-
ed to start in early 1974.
Credit 401 - Damascus Water Supply Project; US$15 million Credit of
June 22, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.

nel from the spring to Damascus; reservoirs (70,000 m ); a new pump-
ing station and about 530 km of water mains in the distribution sys-
tem; training of EPEF staff in management and engineering; and con-
sulting services. The project also compri'Ses water pollution control
and sewerage studies for the Barada and Orontes basins, including the

PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS:
Goods and services financed by the Bank Group would be procured
after international competitive bidding under the Bank's guidelines, except
for: (i) construction of village community buildings, water supplies, and
administrative buildings, which would be let in small contracts to local
contractors after local competitive bidding; these works, amounting to about
$2.5 million, are not suitable for international bidding because they are
widely scattered and construction would be spread over a long period; and
(ii) contracts for imported equipment, materials and supplies not exceeding
$5,000 each and an aggregate amount of $100,000. Major civil works costing
about $149 million equivalent would be divided into three construction con-
tracts. The Government has not requested a preferential margin for local
manufacturers of equipment in the evaluation of bids.
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:
The Borrower is finalizing a contract with GERSAR, France, for
consultant services to be provided for:
-    Review of designs and specifications prepared by GADEB's
consultants (Technoexportstroy, Bulgaria); bid evaluation;
preparation of detailed coordination program; assistance
to GADEB in projects' supervision; recommendations on
detailed operation and maintenance procedure, including
specifications and tenders for equipment needed.
-    Establishment and organization of an Agricultural Extension
Service, including a training program for extension officers
and farmers, and agricultural machinery services.
-    Application of improved methods of soil management and
irrigation.
Consultants are yet to be selected for:
-    Operational studies of Lake Assad under different assumptions
of inflow and outflow; review of the hydrological data already
collected; recommendations for the establishment of improved
flood forecasting; operating rules and procedures for the
operation of the reservoir; assessment of the energy potential
consistent with irrigation requirements.
