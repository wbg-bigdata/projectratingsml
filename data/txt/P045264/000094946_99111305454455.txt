SMALLHOLDER CATTLE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT REPORT
1.    Introduction. This resettlement report was compiled by the Environmental Impact
Assessment Center of the China Agricultural University in Beijing, China from data received by
the Project provinces of Hebei, Henan, Shanxi and Anhui. The report covers all four provinces
under this Project and for each province employs a resettlement issues matrix, a listing of all
Project sites and uses, and detailed compensation budgets. At the time of preparation no
voluntary or involuntary resettlement was scheduled under this Project. The Project is designed to
maximize the use of land and facilities already in use for cattle production, rather than acquiring
new sites or facilities. Since beef cattle raising does not require expensive arable land, most of the
incremental Project land sites have been specifically selected on non-inhabited, non-cultivated
waste lands or on land already owned by the sponsoring production units. No persons are
scheduled for resettlement. Compensation plans as recorded in this report, apply only to
compensation for newly acquired land to be occupied for project activities. Aside from this new
land, all other land to be used for project activities is already owned by the project sponsors and
does therefore not require compensation.
The total estimated incremental land use for Project activities, including land already owned; to
be rented; or purchased; is 57.6 ha (864 mu) and is distributed as follows:

The Project would support integrated household-based cattle production, genetic cattle
improvement, marketing and processing. To this end, 294,000 head of cattle would flow at full
production from households to feedlots and markets, and from there to processing plants or to
other households for breeding purposes. A technical support veterinary, forage and insemination
services system, operating from service centers, offices and laboratories, would be upgraded and
expanded to support this effort. The final environmental impact report for this Project, which has
been rated an impact category B, has been cleared by ASUEN, as has this report. This report also
includes the resettlement guidelines framework for project implementation.

A. RESETTLEMENT REPORT FOR HEBEI PROVINCE
2.      This inforantion is provided by Hebei Provincial Animal Husbandry Bureau which
guarantees its accuracy and will inform the World Bank if any resettlement occurs that has not
been foreseen in this document.
3.      Investigations into the proposed feedlots, markets, service stations and slaughterhouses
have been carried out according to the World Bank Mission's requirement and suggestions
concerning resettlement issues. Table 2 indicates that no resettlement is planned to take place in
Hebei project areas.
4.      Feedlots. All 53 feedlots are to be built or wasteland or are expansions of existing
feedlot sites. Of 22 feedlots with a 300-cattle capacity, ten are to be expanded on wasteland and
12 are to be extended on the existing sites of feedlots. Of the 31 feedlots with a 100-cattle
capacity, 14 are to be built on wasteland, the others are to be expanded on existing cattle
farms. No resettlement is needed in the construction or expansion of the feedlots.

6.     Support Services System. A  total of  one county cattle market and 96 county
veterinary stations are to be expanded. They are all meant to improve the service functions of
existing centers and stations, without building any new ones. No additional land would be
needed.
7.     Feed Mill. The expansion of one feed mill is included in the Project. The proposed
expansion needs 0.7 ha of new land beyond the feed mill 's existing yard, and was purchased
for Y3.96 million from the Qinhuangdao High-Tech Development Zone Authority.
8.     Qinhuangdao Slaughterhouse. The newly-built Huaxing Beef Processing Plant
would use 4.3 ha (64.5 mu) of land. This site was formerly used to store solid wastes by a
building company and is not inhabited. This site would be acquired from Qinhuangdao
municipality for Y 3.4million.

11.  Feedlots. In the 51 feedlots proposed for expansion or upgrading, 36 would use wasteland
as their site and 15 would expand on existing cattle farms. No resettlement is expected to
occur. The 51 feedlots would require 10.2 ha (153 mu) of land, of which 5.4 ha (81 mu) is
already in use as existing feedlots, and 4.8 ha (72 mu) would be required as additional land,
which is classified as uninhabited, uncultivated waste land. Locations and land use details are
presented in Table 5.

15.    Feedlots. Of the 12 feedlots which are proposed to be built, ten would be located on
existing cattle farms and two would use 1.4 ha of additional, uninhabited wasteland. Locations
and land use details are presented in Table 7. Of the total 8.6 ha (129 mu) of land required 7.1
ha (107 mu) of land is already in use for this purpose, and 1.4 ha (21 mu) of waste land would
be acquired for feedlot expansion, to be purchased from local village committees for Y2.1
million. This land has no present human habitation or cultivation.

16.    Other subprojects. The following subprojects are all to be rebuilt or expanded within
their existing borders: one Service Center at the prefecture level; 12 service centers at county
level; 100 service centers at township level; and one feed mill . No incremental land would be
needed for this subproject development. The expansion of the Provincial Beef Cattle Service
Center requires 7.5 mu of additional land. for which a piece of unused flood land along the
Fenhe River has been selected as the expanded site. This land would be rented from the
municipality for Yuan 1,200/mu/year. The 12 county-level cattle markets would require a
combined 1.4 ha (21 mu) of incremental land which comprises uninhabited wastelands owned
by the county governments. This land would be purchased for a total of Y2.1 million. No
human resettlement would be involved.

20.   Service centers. The Provincial Breeding Center and the Fuyang Breeding Center are
to be reconstructed on existing land without any land expansion. Township service stations are
to be improved at existing locations. Veterinary service centers would require an incremental
7.5 ha (112.5 mu) of land for expansion.
21.   Cattle markets. The Liulin Market in Mengcheng County and the Wuyu Market in
Sixian County are to be rebuilt within their existing borders. The Sanhe Market in Changfeng
County, Hefei City is to be expanded, renting 1 ha (15 mu) of uninhabited, hilly wasteland land
not suitable for farming.
22.   Slaughterhouse. The Yumei Processing Plant is to be expanded within its original
plant yard.

RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK GUIDELINES FOR PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Introduction
1.   The project would assist the government's policy of developing its beef cattle sub-sector
in response to emerging market demand for quality beef. The project would put special emphasis
on assisting the smallholder level in the inland provinces of Henan, Hebei, Anhui and Shanxi.
These areas have surplus labor and natural resources, but productivity and quality of cattle are
low due to lack of technology and infrastructure. The project aims to increase production and
improve quality and marketability of smallholder cattle production in order to enhance farmer
incomes and reduce poverty. These objectives would be achieved through: (a) introduction of
improved breeding, feeding and production technologies; (b) development of commercial
infrastructure which would provide the linkages between production and markets; (c) increasing
value-added to cattle production through processing; (d) strengthening animal husbandry
institutions to better provide support services to farmers; and (e) upgrading of regulatory services
to include market incentive-driven grading and quality control. The project would promote the
effective use of existing, low-value crop residues and other natural resources, foster the
development of commercial cattle production and encourage the participation of women in
production.
2.    The Government and the Bank have identified the need for land acquisition and
resettlement of affected people under the cattle production, marketing linkages and infrastructure
strengthening components. The project's fourth component (breed and feed improvement
component) does not require land acquisition or resettlement.
3.    The cattle production component involves the expansion of 131 feedlots in the four
provinces; the marketing linkages component involves the establishment or expansion of eight
pilot cattle markets on existing market sites, and one beef processing plant; the infrastructure
strengthening component involves the expansion and upgrading of 113 veterinary technical
stations and 1 12 artificial insemination stations. In order to cover the eventuality of unanticipated
land acquisition in any of the project's components, and to mitigate any adverse impacts of
project activities, comprehensive resettlement actions plans, RAP principles and implementation
guidelines are outlined indicated in Sections C and D below. These RAPs include: (a) detailed
surveys results of people and assets affected; (b) description of legal framework for addressing
land acquisition, resettlement and compensation requirements; (c) organizational responsibilities;
(d) detailed cost estimates and funding requirements; (e) comrmunity participation. consultation
and grievance procedures; and (f) monitoring and evaluation programs to be carried out by the
project and an independent external group.
4.    Land available for the development of feedlots, markets and service facilities under the
production and infrastructure development components would be commercial land which does
not currently have any occupants or dwellings. In the event that agro-business enterprises (cattle
slaughtering houses or meat processing plants under the marketing linkages component) would
be located on farmland, crop compensation and relocation costs would be paid to farmers, with
the amount dependent on the value of the crops grown. RAPs would then need to be prepared on
the basis of policies and principles acceptable to the Bank, if any additional resettlement would
be necessary under the project, to be reviewed and approved by the Bank.



13
5.   In order to effectively carry out the RAPs under the cattle production, marketing linkages
and infrastructure development components and to address any unexpected changes that may result
in involuntary resettlement in these or other project components, the Government of China and the
World Bank have agreed on the following guidelines to ensure equitable and effective treatment of
resettlement issues under the Project.
B. Legal Framework
6.     The "Regulations on the Requisition of Land for State Construction" (1982) provides for
compensation based on the requirements for restoring income.
7.     The "Land Administration Law" (1986) and related amendments (1988) require that
incomes and assets be protected during resettlement and that affected communities be consulted
during the project design stage. In addition, resettlers are given the specific right to challenge
resettlement decisions in the courts. The law gives affected cities, counties, and collectives
responsibility for implementing resettlement and provides guidance on resettlement principles,
organization, and compensation. Provinces are required to draw up implementing regulations that
conform to the national legislation, which define more precisely resettlement procedures and
compensation for various types of land and other property. Provinces may also give cities and
counties the right to enact additional resettlement regulations confirming to national and provincial
law. These local laws have gained added significance with the decision of the state Council in 1992
to end the previous blanket exemption of national projects from local resettlement regulations,
provincial, city, and county regulations.
C. Resettlement Principles for the Project
8.    At appraisal, no resettlement was identified. In case, however, that resettlement should
become necessary, the Chinese Government and the Bank have agreed on the following principles
to be employed. Resettlement may include the movement of people away from feedlots or
processing plants.
*  Involuntary resettlement will be avoided or minimized where feasible; to this end, all
viable alternative project designs will be explored;
*  Beneficiary participation is an integral part of project design. Affected persons will thus
participate in decisions that might entail resettlement activities. In such cases, they will
be clearly informed of the resettlement activities required and their options and legal
rights prior to the initiation of any resettlement activity. Institutionalized arrangements
will be established to facilitate communication during the planning and implementation
of resettlement; and an effective and well understood grievance process will be
developed.
*  Affected persons will be resettled within their original village whenever possible. If this
is not possible, they will be resettled as closely as possible to their original village. The
principles for selecting relocation sites will be: (a) within the same village; (b) to
adjacent villages within the same county; and (c) other villages within the same county.



14
* Affected persons will be resettled in similar livelihoods: where possible, agriculture
workers will be resettled with agricultural jobs, industrial workers will be resettled with
industrial jobs. If this is not possible, affected persons will be ensured suitable
employment in an endeavor other than that of their previous employment, and will
receive retraining where necessary to render them suitable for such employment.
*  Affected persons will be resettled as groups whenever possible to reduce social
disruptions.
*  The affected enterprises and individuals must be ensured to at least regain if not
improve their present production and living standard. The new houses will be built by
affected persons themselves, but persons With difficulties will be helped by the local
government to build new houses.
*  The affected persons will be consulted regarding the resettlement plan, their choice of
resettlement sites, standard and area, their option regarding the type of rehabilitation
preferred by them and compensation rates of land acquisition.
*  Individuals affected by land acquisition in collectives will be able to regain access to
land through land distribution.
*  All of the affected persons, including floating population (persons without permanent
local residence registration certificates), if any, will be paid compensations for all the
affected assets at replacement value of those assets. Depreciation will not be deducted
from the current replacement prices for computing the compensation payable.
*  Affected persons, even those without legal title to land (including herdsmen, etc.), are
entitled to assistance and compensation if adversely affected in their customary usage
of land for grazing or other purposes.
*  All affected enterprises will be paid compensations and allowances according to the
compensation policies, with payment of all costs associated with the resettlement
completed within three months of resettlement. All affected enterprises in need to be
relocated close to their existing location and all the affected workers will be employed
in the same reconstructed enterprises. The relocated enterprises will restore production
scope and conditions so as to let affected workers' living standard be rehabilitated or
improved. Salary compensation and work stoppage allowance will be paid.
*  People affected by loss of houses will all get compensation at replacement rates. There
will be no deduction for depreciation or the cost of salvageable materials. Valuation of
lost assets will be made at full replacement cost.
* The total level of compensation will ensure that the living standards, income earning
capacity, and production levels are improved, or at least do not deteriorate, as a result of
their resettlement.
*  Payment of compensation and resettlement of the affected persons will be completed at
least one month before construction is initiated, otherwise construction of the project
cannot be commenced.



15
*  Objections of affected persons will be given adequate consideration during the
resettlement process and their problems will be solved through consultation.
*  Grievance redress mechanisms will be applied with the opportunity for the affected
persons to appeal to secure full protection of their rights.
D. Implementation Arrangements
9.   Planning and Organizational Responsibilities. The Provincial Project Management Offices
(PPMOs) in the project provinces of Henan, Hebei, Anhui and Shanxi will have overall
responsibility for planning, supervising and monitoring the implementation of all resettlement plans.
The prefecture and county PMOs will be responsible for the preparation and approval process, and
monitoring of resettlement plans. The implementation of all resettlement plans will be subject to the
approval and clearance of such plans by the relevant local authorities. The PPMO and prefecture
and county PMOs will coordinate closely with these authorities with respect to the monitoring of
approved resettlement plans. The agencies responsible for the implementation of each project
component will be responsible for the preparation, approval processing, and monitoring of
resettlement plans. Local governments with authority over the subcomponent project site may,
where applicable, share in the amelioration of resettlement through the provision of land, buildings,
or other assets lost in land acquisition of loss of dwellings.
10.   If more than 200 people are adversely affected in any one subcomponent, prior approval of
a resettlement plan is required by the World Bank before initiation of the civil works on any
(sub)component involving resettlement. Retrofit planning and implementation will be required in
the event that resettlement impacts are discovered after civil works are initiated.
11.   The resettlement plan's scope would be consistent with agreed upon guidelines, based on
the criteria outlined in section E below. The resettlement plans would be based on baseline surveys
in the affected areas. Any resettlement needs would be identified within the participation framework
outlined in the Project Implementation Plan. The objective of public participation and consultation is
to ensure that the resettlement actions when completed reflect the actual needs of the affected
individuals and institutions, to guarantee the implementation of the resettlement plan and to ensure
the benefits of the affected individuals and institutions.
12.   Affected individuals and institutions would thus participate in the resettlement project
identification stage as well as in the compilation stage of the resettlement and relocation plans. This
would include identification of the site, scale, degree and impact of the resettlement project as well
as investigations into the physical indicators of resettlement, investigation into the social and
economic status of the affected populations and establishment of compensation standards for the
relocation and relocation scheme.
13.   Any arrangements necessary for physical relocation of people are to be completed before
they are displaced.
14.   Resettlement Plans. A resettlement plan will be prepared for each and every case that
involves land acquisition or displacement of people. The content and level of detail of the
resettlement plan will vary with the magnitude of the resettlement. When more than 200 individuals



16
are affected in a (sub)component, a comprehensive resettlement plan for thatsubcomponent will be
prepared that addresses the following issues:
*  organizational responsibilities;
*  community participation and integration with host populations;
*  socio-economic survey;
*  legal framework;
* alternative sites and selection;
*  valuation of and compensation for lost assets;
*  land tenure, acquisition, and transfer;
* access to training, employment, and credit;
*  shelter, infrastructure, and social services;'
*  environmental protection and management;
*  implementation schedule, monitoring, and evaluation; and
*  detailed cost estimates.
15.    When 200 or fewer individuals are affected in a (sub)component, a summary resettlement
plan for that subcomponent will be prepared that addresses the following issues:
-  organizational responsibilities;
*  community participation and integration with host populations;
*  valuation of and compensation for lost assets;
*  implementation schedule, monitoring, and evaluation; and
*  detailed cost estimates.
16.  The measures and indicators to be attached to such a plan would include the following:
Measures                                  Indicators
Organizational responsibilities           Resettlement group established within
project management office
Community participation and integration with   Survey results of community interviews
host populations
Valuation of and compensation for lost assets   Documentation of valuation and
compensation
Implementation schedule, monitoring, and  Timebound resettlement schedule, follow-up
evaluation                                and evidence of M&E
Detailed cost estimates                   Documentation of cost estimates and
payment of same
17. World Bank Review of Resettlement Plans. The World Bank's prior approval of resettlement
plans will be required for any resettlement plan for a (sub)component in which more than 200
persons are affected. All other resettlement plans will be subject to ex-post review by World Bank
supervision missions.



17
18.   Sources of Funding for Resettlement. The project provinces of Henan, Hebei, Anhui and
Shanxi will be financially responsible for any resettlement obligations as described in this
Framework. The determination of resettlement costs will be based on the principles of land
acquisition and resettlement, and will be implemented in accordance with existing local land
administration and other resettlement laws.
E. Compensation/Resettlement Policies
19.   Land acquisition and resettlement will be implemented in accordance with the provisions of
the respective Resettlement Action Plans. In the following, some general policies are described.
20.    Compensation for loss of houses and other structures. For compensation of houses and
other structures the following guidelines will apply:
*  Compensation for affected houses and buildings, owned by enterprises or individuals
will be paid at replacement rates as to be determined in the Resettlement Plans. No
deduction in compensation will be made for depreciation or the cost of salvageable
material.
-  Resettlement offices in the county and will be set up to organize the resettlement work
uniformly and conclude agreements with relocated persons on house areas,
compensation rates and costs. The affected houses will be removed only after the
affected persons move into their new houses.
*  Land for new houses will be provided by the village and the cost will be paid by the
project provinces.
21.    Compensation for loss of farmland For compensation of farmland the following
guidelines will apply:
*  Adverse impacts on farmland and crops should be avoided at all cost. In the case that
this is unavoidable, the affected persons will be provided with replacement land
through land redistribution which is the responsibility of the township govemment.
*  Farmland, vegetable fields, woodland and orchards: The land compensation fee will be
calculated as 5 times the annual average yield of the three-year-period prior to the
acquisition. Compensation for standing crops will be paid at market price.
*  Grazing land: compensation for land is made by 4 times the annual average yield of the
3-year-period prior to the acquisition.
*  Residential land: compensation is made for land at 80% of the compensation standard
set for farmland.



18
22.    Compensationfor loss of crops. For the compensation of farmland the following guidelines
will apply:
*  Farmland, vegetable fields, woodland and orchards: the compensation fee will be
calculated as two times the annual average yield of the three-year-period prior to the
acquisition.
*  Grazing land: compensation for young crops is made by two times the annual average
yield of the three-year-period prior to the acquisition.
23.    Compensationfor loss of trees. For the compensation of trees the following guidelines will
apply:
*  Ordinary trees: 100 Yuan RMB/piece for trees with diameter above 20 cm; 70 Yuan
RMB/piece for trees with diameter ranging from 5 cm to 20 cm; 3OYuan RMB for trees
with diameter below 5 cm;
*  Fruit trees: 400 Yuan RMB/piece for production trees; 200 Yuan RMB/piece for non-
production young trees.
24.    Payment of Compensation. For payment of compensation the following guidelines will
apply:
C* ompensation for standing crops, houses and other private structures will be paid
directly to the affected persons.
* Compensation for affected land and public infrastructure and the resettlement subsidy
will be paid by the prefecture or county government to collectives or production teams
losing land, for arranging the resettlement and rehabilitation of the affected persons,
and for replacing the affected infrastructure.
* In case some enterprises agree to provide employment to the persons declared surplus
labor, the resettlement subsidy will be paid directly to the enterprises.
* Compensation for affected enterprises will be paid directly to the respective enterprises.
In case of private enterprises, the compensation will be paid directlv to the owners.
25.    Development of Civil Infrastructure. All civil infrastructure facilities will be fully replaced
at the relocation sites. in case any private infrastructure facilities are affected, they will be
compensated at replacement rates. The project will provide all basic infrastructure facilities at the
resettlement sites. The Project provinces will be responsible for making special provisions, if
necessary, to ensure that the standards of living of all categories of affected persons are fully
restored after resettlement/relocation.



19
F. Monitoring and Evaluation
26.  Monitoring Structurea A land acquisition monitoring structure, in accordance with ODs4.30
(monitoring infrastructure) and 10.70 (monitoring indicators and targets) will be set up as part of the
overall project management infrastructure and will comprise, in hierarchical order, the Provincial
PMO (PPMO) as the project's chief monitoring coordinator, in collaboration with prefecture and
county PMOs. The PPMO will receive approved land acquisition plans, other relevant data, and
progress reports directly from the lower level PMOs. Resettlement monitoring will provide an early
warning system for project managers via the PPMO, which would ensure information objectivity
through direct, in-house monitoring. A channel for resettlers to make known their needs would be
established, from the local authorities or the subcomponent monitoring unit, directly to the PPMO.
Monitoring progress reports would be submitted by the local PMO to the PPMO, as part of the
routine semi-annual subcomponent progress reporting. During the first year of subcomponent
implementation, the PPMO will have the right, where warranted, to request more frequent progress
update reports. Baseline and implementation socio-economic surveys on resettlement plans
involving over 200 persons will be carried out to compare the without and with-(sub)component
effects of resettlement on affected persons. Bank review of the monitoring progress will be at
semiannual intervals during the first year of (sub)component implementation and annually
thereafter, throughout the project's implementation period. Annual progress reports, in tandem with
Bank supervision missions, where feasible, will be received for Bank review thereafter, throughout
the project's five-year life span.
27.    Monitoring indicators for the project, to be reported to the Bank, will include:
* Date of approval of resettlement proposals and compliance with these Guidelines.
* Confirrmation that subcomponent monitoring structure is in place.
* Confirmation that communications channel for affected persons to and from the PMO
is in place.
* Target date(s) for expected resettlement benefits to resettlers.
- Target date for replacement of land, where applicable.
* Date(s) of occupation of new or replacement housing.
* Confirmation of equal replacement value of housing or land.
 Confirmation and date(s) of allocation of replacement jobs.
*  Confirmation of amount of replacement salaries/income.
* Confirmation and date(s) of job retraining, where relevant.
