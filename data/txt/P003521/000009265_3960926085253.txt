MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT OF SDR 15.9 MILLION
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A PLANNING SUPPORT AND SPECIAL STUDIES PROJECT
1        The following report on a proposed development credit of SDR 15.9
million ($20.7 million equivalent) to the People's Republic of China is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
and would finance a planning support and special studies project.
2        Background.  During the pa.c year, the Government has on several
occasions, most recently in January, 1987, indicated that it intends to
broaden and deepen its cooperation with the Bank Group. In this connection,
it has requested that Bank/IDA lending to China during the current 7th Five
Year Plan (1986-90) and beyond should increase significantly, and that its
focus and specific objectives should be integrated with the developmental
priorities set forth in the Plan. The Government has also expressed interest
in Bank support for medium- and long-term planning studies required as
background for the 8th Five Year Plan (1991-95), initial preparations for
which are expected to begin during the next twelve months.
3        Meanwhile, the process of economic management and planning in China
is undergoing major change. Direct control of virtually all economic
activities--specifically, physical planning of production, centralized
allocation of materials, and budgetary grants for fixed investment--is being
replaced by increased reliance on a variety of indirect controls and macro-
economic policy instruments. This new approach to planning and economic
management--with the medium-term as the principal time frame for both short
(annual) and longer-term planning activities--will require strengthening of
the Government's statistical and analytical capability to evaluate programs
and policies to address specific issues, and to monitor their results and
impact. This in turn will involve changed roles for the State Planning
Commission (SPC) at the central level, for the planning bureaus at the provin-
cial/municipal level, and for planning and finance departments of sectoral
ministries and agencies at all levels. It will also involve a new and greatly
enhanced role for the People's Bank of China (PBC), recently restructured to
function as China's central bank, as well as the banking and financial sector
generally. Finally, economic reform will impose substantial demands on these
agencies' existing systems for staff recruitment, development and training,
improved data collection and processing and strengthened policy planning,
analysis and research.
4        In  addition to this urgent requirement to reform and strengthen
China's macroeconomic planning process, there is a growing need for a variety
of advisory services and/or training activities of an inter-sectoral nature
which, partly because they are not the sole or main responsibility of a single



sector, ministry or agency, often do not receive the priority that their
potential contribution to the modernization process deserves--for example, the
recent growth of numerous local consulting companies and groups, and the
development of a modern construction and contracting industry. There are also
an increasing number of innovative and experimental initiatives, related to
both rural and urban reforms already underway, for which Bank Group technical
advice and assistance has been requested.
5        Proiect Objectives.  The project's specific objectives would be
threefold: (a) to help strengthen the Government's overall development policy
and planning capability through sector planning studies required as background
for the preparation of the 8th Five Year Plan; (b) to identify, prepare and,
as appropriate, to carry out technical assistance activities of an inter4ec-
toral, innovative or experimental nature through advisory services and/or
special studies; and, (c) to facilitate generally the implementation of the
Government's program of economic, financial and institutional reforms through
in-service education and training (in country and, where appropriate, over-
seas) of,officials of the central and provincial/municipal governments.
6        Project Desgritio2n.  The project would consist of subprojects to
achieve these objectives, for which IDA financing of $20.7 million is
proposed. About two thirds would be available for sector planning studies
and about one third for technical assistance and training. A breakdown of
costs and a financing plan is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements as well as the disbursement schedule are given
in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations are contained in Schedules C and D, respectively.
7        At the Government's request, a total of $9 million would be allocated
at the outset for three comprehensive planning studies for the iron & steel,
petrochemicals, and electric power sectors to be carried out, with the
assistance of foreign and local consultants, by the Ministry of Metallurgical
Industry (MMI), the China Petrochemical Corporation (SINOPEC) and the
Ministry of Water Resources ard Electric Power (MWREP) respectively. These
three studies would be initiated shortly (commencing about October 1, 1987)
and are expected to be substantially completed during the first half of 1989--
in time for their principal conclusions and recommendations to be incorporated
in the preparation of the 8th Five Year Plan. The balance of unallocated
credit proceeds available under this category would be committed for similar
planning studies to be identified by the Government during the next 12 months.
Sectors under consideration include transport (highways, ports and railways),
the chemicals and mining industries and water development and management.
8        Subprojects identified and prepared under the technical assistance/
special studies and training category, totalling $5 million include: (a) two
State Planning Commission (SPC) subprojects: one, designed to improve the
capability of its various Planning Bureaus through strengthened information
systems and the introduction of modern planning methodologies, especially in
macro-management; and, the other aimed at enhancing the capacity of its



-3 -
National Planners' Training Center; (b) one subproject to be carried out by
the China International Engineering Consulting Corporation (CIECC), the
principal agency responsible for appraising and evaluating major investment
projects for inclusion in the Plan, to help strengthen CIECC's capability to
undertake feasibility studies, to appraise and evaluate key investment
projects on behalf of SPC, and to provide project management and supervisory
services; and (c) a program of in-service training, in China and overseas, for
officials and staff of the People's Bank of China (PBC) in central banking
functions, monetary and credit policy formulation and implementation, and
policy support analysis and research. This latter program would complement a
project designed to help establish a permanent PBC in-service training center,
being financed by UNDP.   A fifth subproject, to train central and provincial/
municipal govr..nment financial staff, has been identified and is under
preparation by the Ministry of Finance (MOF).
9        Detailed terms of reference, including estimated costs, implementa-
tion schedules and proposed organizational arrangements for the iron & steel
and petrochemicals planning studies noted above have been agreed with the
implementing agencies concerned. Terms of reference for the electric power
study are under preparation. The five technical assistance and training
subprojects have been reviewed and agreed wich the Government and detailed
implementation plans are currently under preparation. A summary description
of seven subprojects accounting for $13 million to be allocated at the outset
of the project is included in the attached Technical Annex.
10       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The overall goal of the Bank Group's
financial and technical assistance to China is to help remove critical con-
straints in key sectors of the economy such as energy, industry, transport,
agriculture, human resource development and technology transfer.   Equally
important is the Bank's role--through economic, sector and project work--in
promoting the effective and efficient use of both external and domestic
resources by improved planning, project selection and analysis, and develop-
ment policy formulation and management.  The project meets both these objec-
tives and, moreover, has the potential for a far reaching and longer-term
contribution to China's development planning process, desired by both the
Government and the Bank. It would complement the existing Second Technical
Cooperation Credit (Cr. 1664-CHA) which the Government is using almost
erntirely for preparation of individual investment projects for Bank/IDA
financing. It would also enhance the quality of the Bank's cooperation and
dialogue with the Government on issues relating to the reform of the economic
planning and management system. The project's concept enjoys explicit
Government support at the highest level.
11       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, the Government agreed that:
(a) all subprojects proposed for financing (and for which no other suitable
source of external financing is available) would satisfy the basic criteria
outlined in para. 5 above; (b) the project would be coordinated by SPC with
participation by MOF; and (c) the proceeds of the credit would be made
available to the subproject implementing agencies on concessional terms (20



- 4 -
years, including five years of grace, and a service charge of 1 per cent per
annum). An understanding was also reached that the organizational and
management arrangements for implementation of individual subprojects,
including the designation of task forces/working groups required for their
direction and overall guidance, would be determined on a case-by-case basis by
agreement between the Government and IDA.
12       Justification & Riskl.  Given its technical assistance nature, the
project is broadly justified by the contribution it would make to China's
overall planning and reform process and by the qualitative support it would
provide to the Bank's economic, sector, lending and technical assistance
activities. For these reasons, and because the project was jointly initiated
and prepared by the Government and the Bank, it is unlikely to experience the
problems of implementation sometimes experienced with similar technical
assistance projects. Nevertheless, this is the first project in China to be
coordinated by SPC and involving several different executing agencies, and
there is some risk of delay for these reasons. Accordingly, the Bank's
Resident Mission in Beijing will provide specific support to the headquarters
staff responsible for monitoring and supervision of individual subprojects.
13       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Assk iation and recommend that the
Exective Directors approve the proposed credit.

PLANNING SUPPORT AND SPECIAL STUDIES PROJECT
Detailed Project Description
The project consists of two parts. Part A includes support for
sector planning studies and Part B provides for technical assistance and
training.
Part A - Planning Support
1.        Part A of the project would help strengthen the Government's overall
development policy and planning capability through comprehensive sector
planning studies, approved by the State Council and to be undertaken by the
central government ministries/agencies concerned, as background for
preparation of the 8th Five Year Plan (1991-95). The credit would finance
consultants' services, training, equipment and materials needed to undertake
these studies, three of which--amounting to up to $9 million--have been
identified, prepared and would be ready for implementation later this year.
The background, objectives and scope of work of each of these three studies
were agreed with the Government during appraisal and are summarized below
(paras. 2-6). Detailed terms of reference for the first two studies were also
agreed with the Government during appraisal and are in the Project Files.
Those for the electric power study are under preparation and will be finalized
with the authorities concerned in June, 1987.
2.        Iron & Steel.  The Government is planning a major expansion in steel
production to meet domestic demand which, by the year 2000, is expected to
have increased to about 100 million tons of finished steel products annually--
corresponding to an annual average growth rate of about 5%. This projected
demand is almost double the existing domestic production capacity. In
addition to expanding capacity, the efficiency of current iron and steel
production facilities and distribution systems needs to be upgraded
significantly in order to improve the availability of steel products in
appropriate quantities, qualities and prices. Such improvements are
particularly important because of their impact on the future development of
China's engineering and construction industries overall. The planned
expansion in steel production will make substantial claims on a variety of
resources, necessitating the coordinated development of raw materials (e.g.,
iron ore, coking coal, etc.) and supporting infrastructure (e.g., transporta-
tion and power) as well as strengthened institutions and improved policies--
although significant reforms in this latter respect will need to be addressed
in a broader macroeconomic context. The large investments required and the
complexity of the up- and down-stream sectoral linkages involved need to be
considered within the framework of a comprehensive long-term development
strategy and plan, based on an evaluation of costs, benefits and risks of
alternative scenarios. This long-term development strategy, to which the
Government attaches high priority, would include preparation of a coherent set
of action plans designed to achieve sectoral objectives in the most efficient
manner. It would be carried out by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry
(MMI), in consultation with other sectoral ministries and agencies concerned
and with the assistance of consultants to be financed under the project. The



- 11 -
Technical Annex
Page 2 of 6
strategy study would be directed and guided by an inter-ministerial Steering
Committee and would be managed by a working-level task force established
specifically for this purpose.
3.        The overall objective of the study would be to prepare a
comprehensive long-tern. development strategy for China's iron and steel sector
through the year 2000, including the formulation of policies and plans
designed to satisfy estimated medium- and long-term demand for steel products
in the most economically efficient manner through an appropriate combination
of domestic production and imports. Specifically, the study would identify
and recommend alternative development options with respect to inter alia:
(a) the structure of the industry (size, technology, plant location and
capacity, major inputs, markets and infrastructure, management and
organization);
(b) the policy framework (regulatory policies of the central, provincial
and municipal governments) affecting iron and steel enterprises,
including input and output pricing policies and allocation systems,
trade issues including tariff and non-tariff restrictions on
imports, foreign investment and joint ventures, etc.; and
(c) the indust-y's operations and performance (e.g. its productivity.
efficiency, profitability, etc.).
4.        Petrochemicals.  The Government's main objective for the petro-
chemicals subsector is to increase production, particularly of plastics and
synthetic fibres, to eliminate current shortages and to meet expected
increases in domestic demand. Accordingly, it intends to carry out a
comprehensive long-term planning study which, in the first instance, will
constitute an input into the 8th Five Year Plan and in a broader context
suggest alternative options for development of the subsector through the year
2000. The study would be carried out by the China Petrochemical Corporation
(SINOPEC), with the assistance of consultants financed under the project, in
three phases: (a) the first phase would concentrate on reviewing the current
status of the industry in China, including an assessment of the international
environment in which it operates, and on the training of SINOPEC staff in
planning methodologies, etc.; (b) the second phase would focus on the
identification and appraisal of alternative development strategies for the 8th
Five Year Plan and beyond; and (c) the third phase would involve selection of
a specific strategy and, against this background, the preparation of a
development plan, including recommendations for preparation of detailed
economic and pre-feasibility studies for selected investment projects.
5.        Electric Power.  The Government's basic strategy for the electric
power subsector is to modernize and thus increase the efficiency of existing
facilities and to expand capacity to meet the requirements of industrial
development and improved living standards of the population. Bank assistance
in support of these objectives to date has included the financing of five
power generation projects and power transmission project, located mainly at or
near major industrial centers in East and Southern China. Further major
expansion programs are envisaged for both the East China region and for



- 12 -
Technical Annex
Page 3 of 6
Sichuan Province in Southern China and there is a need to prepare long-term
investment plans for both areas. These are also areas currently suffering
from acute power shortage problems. GOC feels, and the Bank agrees, that
methodologies developed in dealing with the problems of these regions could be
applied to many areas of the country thereafter. Accordingly, the project
would support two planning studies, to be carried by the Ministry of Water
Resources and Electric Power (MWREP), with the assistance of consultants, in
East China and in Sichuan Province.
6.        The first, in East China, would include inter alia the following:
(a) load forecasting under changing conditions; (b) defining least cost
alternatives for meeting new peak loads; (c) optimizing plant location and
transmission investments; and (d) organization and management studies. The
second, in Sichuan Province, would include: (a) load forecasting and
research; (b) investigation of specific sites in the upper Yalong and Yangtze
River basins, and priority ranking of proposed hydroelectric power projects on
the basis of technical feasibility and updated economic costs and benefits;
(c) planning and integration of requirements for thermal energy back up and
transmission facilities; and (d) cost of service analysis and reform of power
rates (level and structure).
Part B - Technical Assistance and Training
7.        Part B of the project would support:  (a) the preparation and
implementation of technical assistance activities of an inter-sectoral,
innovative or experimental nature through advisory services and/or special
studies; and (b) help strengthen key government institutions responsible for
carrying out economic and financial reforms through inservice education and
training. Five subprojects meeting these basic criteria--amounting to up to
$5 million--have been identified, of which four were appraised and, subject to
further detailed preparation currently in progress, will be ready for initial
implementation during the second half of calendar 1987. The background, scope
and principal objectives of each of these four subprojects is summarized below
(paras. 8-11).
8.        Strengthening Macroeconomic Planning.  The State Planning Commission
(SPC) is the central government agency responsible for preparing, monitoring
and evaluating China's overall medium-term (five-year) development plans and,
in this context, for approving the plans, including the capital investment
programs, proposed by the planning bur,aus of some thirty provincial,
autonomous regional and municipal government authorities. In line with the
Government's program of economic and financial reform, the direct control of
economic activities--specifically, physical planning of production,
centralized alloc.ation of materials and budgetary grants for capital
investment-is gradually being replaced by increased reliance on indirect
controls and various macroeconomic policy instruments. This new approach to
planning and economic management will require the introduction of modern
planning methods at all levels of the system, including improved data
collection and processing, more sophisticated analytical tools and a
strengthened capability for policy planning, analysis and research. To this
end, SPC has identified a subproject that would have three main objectives:
(a) to review the macroeconomic planning instruments, methods and systems used



- 13 -
Technical Annex
Page 4 of 6
in other countries in order to assess what policies and/or procedures might be
adapted for use in China's specific circumstances; (b) to improve the flow of
data, including both its quantity and quality, to and from SPC at the central
level and planning bureaus at the provincial and municipal levels; and (c) in
this context, to introduce more scientific planning methods.
9.        To achieve the first objective, special studies would be undertaken
relating inter alia to: (a) policies and procedures for medium, and long-term
planning, including economic forecasting, projections and quantitative
analytical methods; (b) techniques for the economic and financial appraisal of
major capital investments, including alternative financing options and the
timing or phasing of such investments; and (c) methods for planning or guiding
the activities of large-scale public and private enterprises. Second, the
flow of data and information between central and local government planning
authorities would be strengthened by the development of modern methods of data
transmission and processing, including computerized networks, and the training
of personnel (analysts and programmers) required for data collection and
analysis. Third, to facilitate the introduction of modern scientific planning
methods generally, software applications and related equipment would be tried
out first by SPC at the central level; if found appropriate, such equipment
would be installed throughout the entire planning system at a later date. A
detailed implementation plan for these activities is currently under
preparation, including detailed specifications of the equipment proposed which
would be subject to review by appropriately qualified experts, in consultation
with IDA.
10.       Training of National/Provincial Planners.  SPC's National Planners'
Training Center (NPTC), established in 1982, is responsible for the training
of SPC staff, of planning and finance officials of central government
ministries and agencies and also of directors and deputy directors of
provincial and municipal planning bureaus. Its regular activities include two
four month-long policy and planning seminars annually and short-term in-
service training courses in such subjects as economic forecasting, computer
applications and macroeconomic management; it also invites foreign experts and
agencies (including EDI on two occasions) for consultancies and courses on
specific topics and is in the process of establishing a language laboratory.
A new building with advanced teaching facilities, now under construction, is
expected to be ready for occupancy during 1988. In order to enhance the
quality of NPTC's training in the short-term and strengthen the institution as
a whole in the medium- and longer-term, the subproject would finance six
discrete but mutually reinforcing activities, as follows: (a) three seminars
for senior and middle-level planning officials (one each in 1987, 1988 and
1989) on regional planning, financial and monetary policy planning, and
national economic planning; (b) visits by 10 foreign experts for lectures/
consultancies; (c) overseas training (6-12 months) for about 35 young pro-
fessionals; (d) two courses, including overseas study tours, for SPC/
provincial planning officials responsible for managing externally-financed
projects; (e) two study tours for a total of 12 senior planning officials; and
(f) language laboratory equipment for six provincial planners' training
institutions (Jilin, Anhui, Hubei, Guizhou and Shanxi Provinces and Nei Mongol
Autonomous Region).

11.       China International Engineering ConsultingCorporation (CIECC).
China's investment program is expanding at a rapid rate with more thtan 40 new
major investment projects and many other smaller investment prc,acts initiated
each year. The SPC is responsible for the review and approval of feasibility
studies of all major projects and select-d medium-sized projects. It is also
responsible for the review of the design of all major investment projects. To
carry out this responsibility, SPC entered into a long-term agreement with the
China International Engineering Consulting Corporation (CIECC) in 1985. Under
CIECC's agreement with SPC, CIECC is responsible to SPC for the review of the
feasibility studies and project designs referred to above. CIECC carries out
these reviews with its own staff, supplemented when necessary by specialists
from its member corporations of which there are 47. This is a major new
responsibility for CIECC which was founded in 1982. To strengthen CIECC's
capability to discharge its new responsibilities, SPC has proposed that IDA
support CIECC's further development through a subproject which will provide
technical assistance, training and related equipment. Accordingly a program
of institutional strengthening was prepared by CIECC and agreed by SPC and
IDA. The subproject's major components are: (a) training of CIECC staff in
China and abroad; (b) establishment of a training center; and (c) improvement
of CIECC's computing activities, including procurement of computers, software
and related equipment. The detailed specifications of the equipment proposed
would be subject to review by qualified experts, in consultation with IDA.
The subproject would also provide assistance for the establishment of a
National Engineering Consulting Association (NECA), thus helping to strengthen
the consulting industry overall.
12.       People's Bank of China (PBC).  During the past two years, China has
embarked upon a major program of financial sector reforms, including the
introduction of indirect monetary policy instruments and the development of
new and existing banking institutions responsible for their own profits and
losses. PBC, China's central bank, is responsible for progressively
implementing these reforms which are placing a heavy burden on its relatively
small number cf qualified and experienced staff. While PBC is receiving
assistance from a variety of sources, including UNDP which is expected to
finance the establishment of a permanent inservice training center, there is
an immediate need for short-term training of senior and middle-level officers
and staff. Accordingly, PBC is currently preparing such a short-term training
program to commence later this year which includes: (a) month-long overseas
study visits for about 150 senior officials (50 per annum during the period
1987-89); (b) overseas education and training for three, six and 12 months for
about 110 PBC staff during the next three years; (c) ten foreign experts/
lecturers for year-long assignments at the proposed inservice training center;
and (d) books, teaching materials and equipment required for the center's
language laboratory.
Project Administration & Implementation
13.       SPC would coordinate the project as a whole with participation from
MOF. Steering Committees (leading groups) would be set up to guide and
monitor the implementation of each individual subproject and their membership
would include representatives of MOF, SPC and of each agency responsible for
implementation of a subproject.



- 15 -
Technical Annex
Page 6 of 6
14.       MOP would handle financial matters in consultation with SPC.  It
would be responsible for financial supervision including the maintenance of
financial records on the status of each subproject, and also the operation of
the project's Special Account. Semi-annual progress reports would be prepared
by SPC in consultation with MOF, and forwarded to IDA. The project imple-
menting agencies would be responsible for monitoring the progress of
individual subprojects. Project-related accounts would be audited by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA and audit reports would be provided to
IDA within six months of the end of each fiscal year.
15.       Seven of the eight subprojects identified have been appraised and
would be approved upon signature of the Development Credit Agreement. These
subprojects are listed in the Attachment. Implementation of each of these
subprojects by the respective implementing agencies would commence by the end
of CY87. Proposals for subprojects to be identified later would be submitted
by potential implementing agencies to SPC. After approval by SPC, in
consultation with MOF, subproject proposals would be sent to IDA for final
approval. The implementing agency would handle all technical aspects of the
subprojects, and would contract consultants, arrange study tours and procure
equipment.
Procurement
16.       Consultant services to be financed from the proposed credit would be
contracted in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.
Contracts for equipment costing $200,000 or more to be financed from the credit
would be procured following ICB procedures in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for Procurement. Domestic manufacturers would receive a preference
of 15% or the applicable customs duty whichever is less, in bid evaluation.
Items and groups of items estimated to cost less than $200,000 for each
contract and not exceeding an aggregate amount of $1.3 million may be procured
on the basis of quotations from at least three qualified suppliers, in
accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA. Proprietar-, items may be
procured through direct purchase in accordance with procedures acceptable to
IDA. Prior review by IDA would be required for equipment contracts estimated
to be $200,000 or more. Reimbursement of expenditures relating to training and
contracts for goods and services each costing less than $200,000 equivalent
would be made on the basis of statements of expenditures. Disbursements of all
other items would be fully documented. A special account with an initial
allocation of SDR 1.1 million would be established under the project. The
project would be completed by June 30, 1992 and the Closing Date would be
December 31, 1992.
