INDIA
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
RAJASTHAN WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
I. THE RAJASTHAN WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Country Background
1.01      The State of Rajasthan is located in the northwestern part of India
bordering Pakistan (M2p IBRD 14817). It is the second largest State, covering
an area of 342,000 km or 10% of India's total area. The Aravalli mountain
ranges divide the State north to south into almost two equal halves. The
western part is the Thar desert, while the eastern part is hilly semi-desert.
Extreme climatic conditions are typical for Rajasthan with temperatures ranging
between -4OC to 50 0C and annual rainfall varying from 50 mm to 2,000 mm.
1.02      The population of Rajasthan was 25.8 million at the 1971 census
and is estimated to have increased by 1979 to about 32 million. About 80%
(26 million) live in rural areas (33,305 villages) and the remaining 20% (6
million) in urban areas 2(175 cities and towns).  The population density averages
about 90 persons per um  which is much lower than the overall average for India
(about 200 persons/km ). The population increase for the period 1961/71 was
27.8%, or 38.5% for urban areas and 25.8% for rural areas.
1.03      The economy of the State is primarily based on agriculture, from
which about 56% of its total income is derived. Of the total area, about 50%
is under cultivation, of which about 20% is irrigated. The per capita income
by 1977/78 was Rs 925 or about 20% below the national average (Rs 1,163). The
State development plan outlay during FY1979 was Rs 95 per capita or only about
45% of the national average (Rs 212).
1.04      The public health level in Rajasthan appears to be below the Indian
average. Infant mortality is more than 10% higher than the all-India figure
and high incidences of dysentery and infectious hepatitis have been reported.
Skeletal fluorosis is comparatively widespread because of the use of ground-
water with high fluoride content. The prevalence of guineaworm also adds
to the number of water-borne diseases. A significant number of villages use
water rated as hazardous to health.
Water Resources
1.05      There are no perennial rivers in the arid region (Western part)
where the main surface water source is the Rajasthan irrigation canal system.
The eastern districts are covered by river systems with highly variable
dry-wet season flows and include some minor lakes.



- 2 -
1.06      The Rajasthan Groundwater Department has comprehensively surveyed
the State's geological formations with regard to groundwater. In general,
groundwater availability is scarce and the quality ranges from satisfactory
to poor. In the desert areas the groundwater is frequently brackish and
available only at considerable depth (below 200 m).
1.07      In brief, the water supply situation is difficult and frequently
remote water sources have to be developed to satisfy basic needs.
Sector Organization and Development
1.08      Most functions at the State Government level related to the water
supply and sewerage sector have since 1965 been concentrated in the Public
Health Engineering Department (PHED) which has been responsible for project
planning and construction, as well as operation and maintenance of rural and
urban water supply systems. The operation of sewerage systems remained a
local function.
1.09      In order to better cope with the needs of the sector, the Government
of Rajasthan (GOR) decided to establish a semi-autonomous State Government
Organization and effective May 1, 1980 established the Rajasthan Water Supply
and Sewerage Management Board (RWSSB) 1/ (see para 5.02).
1.10      The RWSSB/PHED is responsible for all sector activities including
operation and maintenance for both water supply and waste disposal works
(para 3.25). The GOR would retain the powers (i) to borrow funds for capital
investments in water supply and sewerage schemes, for which the priorities
would be based on recommendations to be made by RWSSB; and (ii) to sanction
water supply and sewerage tariffs based also on recommendation made by RWSSB.
1.11      The formation of RWSSB does not exclude the ultimate development
of a two-tier system with local responsibility for operation and maintenance;
a gradual transfer of this function to local bodies might take place in the
future (para 5.04 and 5.05). However, initially all properties would be owned
by GOR and operated by RWSSB. Assurances that all water supply assets have
been transferred from the municipalities to GOR was provided for all proper-
ties currently operated by RWSSB.
1/   A Government order giving notification of the effectiveness of the
Rajasthan Water Supply and Sewerage Corporation Act was issued in January
1980 establishing the Rajasthan Water Supply and Sewerage Corporation.
However, it was subsequently determined that transfer of staff to a new
Corporation would be disruptive and administratively complex. Hence, GOR
decided to continue to utilize the organization of PHED which would
henceforth operate under a Board (RWSSB) established to oversee PHED's
activities. Accordingly, GOR has withdrawn the notification of the
establishment of the Corporation by government order and the Act would
be subject to repeal as soon as necessary legislative action can be
scheduled.



1.12      The establishment of RWSSB is a major step in the development
of the sector. RWSSB and the Medical Department (MD) will administratively
be under the same ministry which would assure continued close cooperation on
health aspects and education in connection with water supply and sanitation.
Proper coordination is also being maintained with other GOR organizations
involved in water resource development and allocation and environmental matters
(the Groundwater Department, the Irrigation Department, and the Water Pollution
Control Board).
Present Service Levels
1.13      Present (1979) and past (1971) service levels (water supply and
sewerage) in rural and urban areas are summarized below:
Water Supply                                  1971    1979

-  % of total                                  5%      5%
1.14      Of a total of 33,305 villages (present population about 26 million),
24,037 (present population about 20 million) have been classified as problem
villages based on criteria such as health hazard aspects and distance and
accessibility to and quality of water sources. By 1979 about 3,800 villages
(almost all of them problem villages) with a population of about 6.3 million
had been provided with piped water supply, mainly through standposts but with
a few private connections covering less than 15% of served population.
Unserved population rely on shallow wells, remote surface water sources or
water collected during the rainy season. About 0.8 million (3%) are served by
water supplied through public handpumps. The service levels are similar to
those in other rural areas throughout India.
1.15      Rajasthan is the only State of India, which has provided all its
cities and towns (175) with piped water supply. In Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota
and Bikaner (the four major cities), accounting for about 32% of the total



- 4 -
urban population, the service levels have remained about constant while in
remaining urban areas they have improved during the period 1971 to 1979.
Rajasthan and the all-India figure for served population in urban areas are
comparable. The water supply is, however, generally intermittent, at low
pressure and unevenly distributed.
1.16      Sewerage systems have been extended mainly to two urban areas (Jaipur
and Jodhpur) covering about 20% of the population in these two cities or about
5% of total urban population, much below the all-India average. The bulk of
the population rely on the conservancy system or have no sanitary facilities
at all. Sanitary conditions, particularly in congested urban areas, are
poor and steadily deteriorating. A program to convert dry latrines into
water seal latrines has commenced but so far its impact cannot be measured.
1.17      In rural areas, there is a general lack of sanitary facilities and
no program has, as yet, been evolved to improve the present situation. The
problems are, however, less severe than in urban areas.
Service Levels Goals
1.18      A long range sector objective is to provide satisfactory water
supplies in all urban and rural areas, and sewerage systems in congested
urban areas, but this would require capital investments that cannot be realized
within the foreseeable future. Priorities have thus been established commen-
surate with the immediate needs of the sector. The development or extension
of water supplies is most urgently required in scarcity rural areas (problem
villages) and in the growing major cities. Likewise, the extension of sewerage
systems is most justified in congested areas of the major cities.
1.19      The objectives are, through FY1986, to increase the service levels
(calculated on total population in rural and urban areas, respectively) as
follows: (i) rural water supply from 24% to about 45%; (ii) urban water
supply connections from 61% to about 72%; and (iii) urban sewerage from 5% to
about 10%. This would imply about 60% coverage (based on population) of the
problem villages and significant improvements (water supply and sewerage) in
the four major cities (Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota and Bikaner). Annex 1, Table 1
shows present and projected service levels in rural and urban areas.
1.20      In order to achieve these objectives (i) sector investments will
have to be increased significantly; (ii) more appropriate cost recovery sys-
tems will have to be introduced; and (iii) RWSSB's project implementation and
works operation capacity will have to be further developed and strengthened.
Sector Investment Program
1.21      The development of the water supply and sewerage sector is given
a comparatively high priority by GOR, as indicated by the proposed increase in
sector investments. Of the total development plan budget, the proportion
allocated to water supply and sewerage would increase from 7% (for the period
1974/78) to 10% (for the period 1979/83).
1.22      Past and projected sector investments (current values) through
FY1985 are shown in Annex 1, Table 2, and summarized below:

1,392           166               2,564           305
1.23      Capital investments in the sector for FY1979 amounted to Rs 186
million and the budget allocation for FY1980 is Rs 263 million. Annual
investment is projected to average about Rs 500 million during the period
FYs1981/85. Likewise, the annual per capita investment in rural areas is
projected to increase from Rs 8 (FY1980) to Rs 11 (average for FYs1981/85);
corresponding figures for urban areas are Rs 11 and Rs 25, respectively. Past
sector investments have been divided between rural water supply, urban water
supply and sewerage on the ratio of 65:33:2; the corresponding ratio for
projected investments (FYsl981/85) is 64:30:6. This also reflects sector
priorities.
1.24      The Government of India (GOI) allocations to State Governments
in general are for the overall development plan rather than for specific
projects and comprise 30% grant and 70% loan. Each State Government estab-
lishes its priorities for the distribution of such funds as well as its own
funds between various sectors. Exceptions are, however, made for special
programs such as the Minimum Needs Program and Accelerated Rural Development
Program, with funds allocated as grants and specifically earmarked. In the
past the subsequent GOR allocation of funds to the water supply and sewerage
sector has been on a 100% grant basis but in the future, it is proposed that
only rural area water supply will be covered by grants. For urban areas, GOR
is expected to make funds available on terms and conditions which would be
commensurate with the sector's capacity to service the debt. Some finance
for the sector for urban areas has also been provided by loans from the Life
Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) to the municipalities, while municipal
contributions have been insignificant.
1.25      The revenues from the urban water supply sector have not been
sufficient to cover operational costs but for FY1980 a breakeven is expected.
The sewerage sector has depended entirely on the municipal budgets since no
charges have been levied. In rural areas water charges are imposed only for
private connections, and corresponding revenues have not covered total operat-
ing costs, which are incurred primarily to provide standpost water to most of
the population. The estimated recurrent cash deficit for rural areas for
FY1979 amounted to Rs 21.3 million and is projected at Rs 38.2 million for
FY1980. This deficit has been covered by GOR budget allocations.



- 6 -
1.26      The State Government objective is to make the sector financially
viable from FY1981 through increased tariff levels in urban and rural areas
and through the introduction of sewerage and standpost water charges.
II. POPULATION, SECTOR SERVICES AND DEMAND
IN THE PROJECT AREA
Population Projections and Demand for Services
2.01      Population projections through 2001 for the state of Rajasthan have
been made by the Directorate of Economics and Statistics (GOR) and, thereafter,
through 2014, by PHED.  The projections through 2001 are as follows:
Total
Year       Population       Urban Areas      Rural Areas
-----------------Million-------------------
1971          25.8             4.6              21.2
1978          30.8             5.6              25.2
1984          35.0             6.5              28.5
2001          49.6             9.7              39.9
The average annual population growth rate for the period 1971/78 is estimated
at 2.6% for total population, the combination of 3.0% for urban and 2.5% for
rural areas.  Corresponding projected average annual growth rates for the
period 1978/2001 are 2.1%, 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. The Town Planning
Department (GOR) has made population projections for the project cities
individually in the light of master plans for urban development and taking
into account such factors as growth potential and industrial development.
These projections are summarized below and shown in Annex 1, Table 4.

2.02      For rural areas, water demand has been estimated at 50 1/cd, and
the extent of private connections has been assumed to be limited to about 15%
of the population.  These assumptions are reasonable in view of the objective
to provide basic services to the maximum number of people and considering the
scarcity of water sources and, consequently, the high investment costs.
2.03      In the four project cities, present service levels would not only
be maintained but reasonable improvements have been assumed. Projected
service levels and average water demand by 1985 are summarized as below:

/a   People who do not use the public systems would rely on private water
supplies.
2.04      Present and projected water demands for the four cities are shown
in Annex 1, Table 4. The projected per capita demand assumes that the future
consumption pattern (for domestic use) will be affected by factors such as
(i) better availability of water, (ii) metering of most of the connections
with charges based on consumption; (iii) extension of water connections to
the lower income groups; and (iv) the introduction of a block tariff structure
to make greater water use more costly. Maximum day consumption, which usually
occurs near the end of the dry season, is estimated at 1.25 times average day
consumption. Standpost water consumption has been projected at 50 1/cd for
rural areas.
Population Served and Standard of Services for Project Areas
2.05      In the ten rural districts, 27% of the population is served by piped
water supplies. About 15% of served population have private connections with
the remaining 85% relying on standpost water supply. The availability of
water is about 50 liters per capita and day (1/cd) which is normally distrib-
uted during a period each morning and evening. The long history of water
scarcity in Rajasthan has produced good habits for its conservative use, and
the standard of service appears to be reasonably good.
2.06      Present service levels (1979) in the four cities are shown in Annex
1, Tables 4 and 5 and are briefly summarized below. Figures in parenthesis
indicate service levels, based on the projected 1985 population, if the systems
were not to be extended.

2.07      Industrial and commercial connections and about 90% of domestic
connections have meters, although many meters do not operate. Water produced
is not currently metered (para 3.32). Water production and consumption data
are therefore of questionable accuracy but the average day consumption (compo-
site for the four cities) would be about 100 1/cd for domestic use; unaccounted-
for water including that distributed through standposts is estimated to average
about 30% of water produced.
2.08      The water supplies are intermittent (only available a few hours per
day) and, because of inadequate pressure, unevenly distributed. Production
capacities are fully utilized. System operation and maintenance suffered from
inadequate availability of funds (para 4.02).
2.09      For Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bikaner (the three cities) combined, about
18% of the population are connected to the sewerage systems, about 30% have
septic tanks, and about 52% use bucket privies (conservancy system) or have no
disposal facilities at all. The connection rate to the sewerage systems in
Jaipur and Jodhpur is comparatively high, covering about 50% of the population
with access to the systems. A larger population than actually connected
benefits indirectly from the sewerage systems since sullage waste discharged
into the storm water system may ultimately enter the sewerage system, the
two systems being interconnected.
2.10      Extreme poverty areas are mainly unplanned developments, which are
provided with standpost water supply but lack sanitation facilities. The
population in such areas probably represents about 20% of the total population.
Design Parameters
2.11      A survey of actuil consumgtion in industrial areas has been carried
out, which varies from 4 m to 12 m per acre per day, depending on the type
of industrial activity. Similar rates have been applied in the projections
for industrial areas to be developed. The unaccounted-for water is expected
to decrease during the project period mainly because of improved metering
(both bulk and customer meters), reduction in number of standposts and the
implementation of a leak detection program.
2.12      Sewage flow is based on the assumption that 75% of water consumption
will enter the sewerage system. In addition, provision has been made for
groundwater infiltration.
Project Locations
2.13      The project is proposed to cover (i) water supplies in about 2,000
problem villages in 10 out of 26 districts of the State and (ii) water supply
and sewerage in Jaipur, Jodhpur, and Bikaner and water supply only in Kota.
Map 14817 shows the location of the various districts and the cities.
Jodhpur and Bikaner and seven out of the ten districts are in the western
desert region of the State.

Development Prospects
2.14      The irrigation canal systems, predominantly in the western districts,
are continously being extended and, by 1978, 2.8 million hectares will have
been made arable. This is projected to increase to 4.3 million hectares by
1984. Concomitant with the extension and improvement of agricultural land is
related rural development including the provision of potable water supplies.
2.15      The four project cities are all administrative and industrial centers
with significant growth pot@ntial.  Kota is highly industrialized and Bikaner
is becoming the focal pnint for increasing development activities in connec-
tion with the constiuctlon of the Rajasthan irrigation canal.
Existing Water Supply and Waste Disposal Systems
2.16      All rural areas have been surveyed regarding the availability
and quality of water resources and have been broadly classified into problem
and non-problem villages. The criteria, which designate a village as a
"problem village," are (i) hardship in transporting the water because of
remotely located water sources or its availability only at considerable depth;
(ii) excessive salinity content; and (iii) health risks because of excessive
fluoride content or prevalence of guinea-worm. Annex 1, Tables 1 and 3 show
the number of villages and population with or without water supplies, which
are summarized below (for 1979).

2.17      Annex 1, Tables 4 and 5, shows major existing water supply and
sewerage works in the four cities.  These systems may be briefly described
as follows:
(a) the water supplies in Jaipur, Jodhpur and Kota are mainly
based on surface water sources (impoundments) with treatment
of raw water before being distributed to consumers. In
Jaipur, groundwater supplements the surface water source,
and Bikaner is entirely served by groundwater;



- 10 -
(b) the distribution areas are subdivided into zones functioning
independently with service reservoirs being fed from wells
or the treatment works; and
(c) the sewerage systems (Jaipur, Jodhpur and Bikaner) are
rather skeletal consisting of laterals, interceptors,
short outfall mains; there is a treatment works only at
Jaipur.
III. THE PROJECT
Genesis
3.01      The project has been developed in close cooperation between GOR
(and RWSSB), the World Bank and the IBRD/WHO Cooperative Program (CP). A
sector study, carried out by CP staff, was completed in August 1978. Project
pre-appraisal took place in October 1978 and June 1979 and appraisal in
November/December 1979 and March/April 1980.
3.02      The rural component of the project was originally envisaged to cover
all 26 districts of the State but it was subsequently decided to concentrate
on 10 districts where water supply problems are most severe. The selection of
the villages proposed under the project has been or will be subject to review
and approval by the Development (Panchayat) Department and district committees
to ensure integrated rural development (para 3.26).
3.03      The project, to be implemented during FYsl981/85, covers about 54%
of GOR's projected sector investment during that period and assists in the
achievement of sector objectives as established by GOR (paras 1.18 and 1.19).
Cost-wise the project would be distributed between rural water supply, urban
water supply and sewerage on a ratio of 39:50:11.
Project Objectives
3.04      The project objectives are:
(a) to provide safe water supplies in about 2,000 problem
villages;
(b) to improve and extend the water supplies in the four cities
(Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota and Bikaner) achieving total coverage
of the population (2.4 million by 1985) and increasing
population served by connections from 67% to 78%;
(c) to extend the sewerage system in the three cities (Jaipur,
Jodhpur and Bikaner) increasing population served by con-
nections from 18% to 34%;
(d) to establish and/or strengthen operations and maintenance
units in urban and rural areas; and



- 11 -
(e) to introduce proper billing and revenue collection systems
and to set water rates to achieve financial self-sufficiency.
3.05      The project would aim at (i) facilitating further rural development
in those villages to be provided with water supplies; (ii) enabling envisaged
industrial expansion in the four cities; and (iii) improving social and
health conditions.
3.06      In the project areas, safe water supplies will be made available
to effectively all of the population. Standpost water supply will be provided
to that population not in a position to have private connections. The sewerage
systems will only cover limited areas of the cities but the total population
would directly or indirectly benefit from the improved environment. Community
toilets will also be constructed where feasible. To enable lower income groups
to connect to the sewerage sytems, the project would provide for credit on
concessional terms to cover connection and basic plumbing installation costs
(para 4.09).
Technological Aspects
3.07      Based on hydrogeological surveys (para 1.06), areas with ground-
water potential have been located, and those villages have been identified
that can be supplied by groundwater economically. For other villages, avail-
able surface water sources (mainly irrigation canals) will be utilized with
appropriate treatment. In order to achieve maximum impact, preferences are
given to villages with large populations, usually those presently provided
with electricity supply and where per capita investment needed is compara-
tively low. The groupings of villages to be covered under each particular
scheme has been or will be subject to least cost evaluations (para 3.26).
Sample schemes have been reviewed in detail, and treatment works alternatives
have been evaluated by consultants, based on which standardized designs are
being prepared.
3.08      For water supply in the four cities, groundwater availability
and quality vary but is generally inadequate or unsuitable for future system
extensions; therefore, existing or new surface water sources must be developed.
Major technical features in the four cities are briefly summarized as below:
(a) In Jaipur, the existing water supply is based on groundwater
(62%) and surface water from Ramgarh (38%).  After the pro-
posed extension of the water supply system, corresponding
figures (by 1985) will be 58% and 42%, respectively. Indi-
vidual tubewell yields, however, are comparatively low and
the groundwater level has shown a receding trend. A hydro-
geological study is presently being undertaken to form the
basis for future groundwater exploitation. 114 tubewells
have been included under the project. These will be sup-
plemented by additional surface water supply from Ramgarh
(about 30 km from the city) by raising the dam and the
construction of a low dam for an impoundment at Kanota
(about 10 km from the city).



- 12 -
(b)  For Jodhpur, the most advantageous alternative is a further
exploitation of Jawai (about 170 km from the city), which
is presently being used. Currently, the water is conveyed
by gravity from Jawai to Jodhpur (via Hemawas) in an open
canal with considerable losses due to evaporation, leakage
and pilferage. The water allocation from the Jawai impound-
ment has been increased (para 3.09). Various alternatives
have been evaluated and the most economical solution is
rehabilitation and raising (to accommodate the increased
water allocation) of the Jawai-Hemawas canal (about 80 km)
and the laying of a closed conduit between Hemawas and
Jodhpur (about 65 km of 1,900 mm conduit), which can follow
a shorter route than the existing canal. The Jawai source
would then be sufficient to about 1991.
(c)  In Kota, the present water source is abundant and is based
on the river Chambal. The intake facilities and treatment
works close to the city and upstream of an existing barrage
will be extended.
(d)  For Bikaner, the present groundwater source is being tapped
beyond its capacity and the groundwater level is receding.
Water quality is also less than satisfactory. The Rajasthan
irrigation canal has recently been extended to a location about
6 km from the city and this water source is the most economical
for development. The groundwater supply will then gradually be
phased out.
3.09      The Jodhpur water source, the Hemawas/Jawai canal system and
impoundments, also supplies villages and one major town en route and provide
water for irrigation purposes. The allocation of water for municipal water
supply is estimated to be 2,750 million cubic feet per year at 70% depend-
ability level. Water is technically released from a number of raw water
reservoirs and the above annual quantity is calculated as an equivalent
quantity at the Jewai impoundment. Since considerable investment will be
based on the total capacity of the system, IDA received assurances from GOR
that an adequate allocation for the water supply purposes will be maintained
in the future.
3.10      Treatment works (settling tanks and rapid sand filtration) will be
constructed in the four cities and, to enable an evaluation of different alter-
natives, international bids for treatment plant equipment on a "performance
basis" are proposed to be invited. For the four cities, local consultant
assistance has been used to evaluate alternatives on the design of trans-
mission and distribution systems, locations of service reservoirs, and zoning
arrangements as well as for preparation of preliminary engineering design for
various water works components.
3.11      For the sewerage and sewage disposal systems, different alternatives
have been investigated regarding population coverage, alignments of intercep-
tors and outfall mains, location of disposal works and type and degree of
treatment. For the latter, local consultant assistance has been used.



- 13 -
3.12      All alternatives recommended for implementation represent least
cost solutions at a discount rate of 10%. The design criteria were reviewed
by the appraisal mission and are acceptable.
Description of Project Components
3.13      The project would include the following major components:  (i) rural
water supply schemes; (ii) extension of water production (intake, treatment
works, tubewells) and water distribution (transmission and distribution mains,
service reservoirs, connections) facilities in the four cities; (iii) exten-
sion of sewage collection (connections, laterals, interceptors) and disposal
works (outfalls, pumping stations, treatment works) in the three cities; and
(iv) consultant services and training.
3.14      The number of rural water supply schemes is tentative and will be
subject to an annual review (para 3.26). The schemes will be simple with
pumping from treatment works or tubewells to storage tanks and a limited
number of distribution mains; some handpump schemes will also be included.
3.15      Increases in production capacities for water supply in rural and
urban areas and major project components are summarized below:

of sewer connections and laying of laterals in congested areas where the con-
servancy system is predominantly used and where, because of space constraints,
other alternatives are not feasible. The treatment works (stabilization ponds)
will be extended in stages and, under the project, only screening and grit

3.17      The consultant studies would cover:  (i) the preparation of organi-
zational and staffing proposals; (ii) the establishment and installation
of a commercial accounting system; (iii) detailed engineering for major works
components including the preparation of tender documents for water treatment
works and tender evaluation; (iv) the preparation of feasibility reports for
further extensions of the water supplies for Jaipur and Jodhpur; (v) the
preparation and implementation of a training program; (vi) the preparation
of project monitoring and reporting systems; and (vii) the preparation and
implementation of a health education program. Only local consultant firms
will be engaged but for part (iii), association with a foreign consultant may
be required for specialized assignments. The total number of man-months for
consultant services is estimated at 900 of which about 10 would be for foreign
consultants.

3.19      The cost estimates in urban areas are based on preliminary engineer-
ing design and in rural areas on per capita costs, which have been derived from
detailed cost estimates for typical sample schemes in respective districts.
The basic costs are at mid-1979 price levels. Physical contingencies have
been assumed to average 10% for rural areas and 15% for urban areas but for
the Jodhpur raw water main (Hemawas-Jodhpur) 25% has been applied because
of uncertainties in the cost estimates and in the availability of suitable
contractors. The price contingencies for both civil works and material and
equipment for local procurement have been estimated assuming cost increases of
8% to April 1, 1980, 10% for FY1981, 7% annually for FY1982 through FY1984 and
5% annually thereafter. The same percentages have also been applied to
foreign procurement, since this would represent an insignificant amount and
the differences between projected price increases for local and foreign
procurement would be minor. Engineering costs have been assumed at 16% of



- 16 -
basic costs including contingencies and include consultant services and
training to an estimated amount of US$1.5 million equivalent. The average
man-month cost including salary, costs, fees, international travel, when
appropriate, and subsistence is expected to be about US$10,000 for foreign
consultants and US$1,000 for local consultants. In addition to these costs
would be the costs of vehicles, drilling equipment, local transportation
and local office operating expenses to the extent required.
3.20      The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$22 million equiv-
alent. This has been based on assumptions made regarding goods to be imported
and on the average foreign cost component in local manufacturing of material
and equipment. The project costs include import duties, excise and sales
taxes estimated at US$5.0 million equivalent.
3.21      The average costs per capita calculated on the 1985 served popu-
lation amount to: (i) for rural water supply US$38; (ii) for urban water
supply US$36; and (iii) for sewerage US$27. These costs are acceptable.
Project Financing
3.22      An IDA Credit of US$80.0 million is proposed, which would finance
about 50% of total project costs (US$164 million equivalent) net of duties
and taxes. The credit would finance all direct and indirect foreign exchange
costs (estimated at US$22 million) and local currency expenditures on civil
works, equipment and material, consultant services, and training (US$58
million).
3.23      Additional funds of US$84 million equivalent would be made avail-
able to RWSSB through normal budget allocations. There would be no municipal
contributions for urban water supply and sewerage, while the villages exclu-
sive of minor deserving case exceptions would contribute the equivalent of
2.5% of capital costs (para 4.13).
3.24      GOR would make funds available to RWSSB/PHED and reflect the follow-
ing terms and conditions in the commercial accounts:
(i)  for rural water supplies, 100% grant; and
(ii)  for urban water supply and sewerage, 100% loan at 6.5%
interest rate with a 25 year term including a five year
grace period.
Project Implementation
3.25      RWSSB/PHED will be responsible for both project implementation and
system operation and maintenance for water supply and sewerage in rural and
urban areas. Completed rural water supply schemes would, however, for reasons
of economy and to encourage local involvement, be operated by the local bodies
provided RWSSB can be assured of satisfactory organization and financial
soundness of the local entities and an agreement can be obtained regarding
the continuation of major maintenance by RWSSB. The responsibility for the
operation of sewerage works, presently under local bodies, as well as all



- 17 -
assets would be transferred to RWSSB by April 1, 1981, to ensure the develop-
ment of proper water supply and sewerage operational entities. IDA obtained
such assurances from GOR.
3.26      For rural water supplies, acceptable technical reports have been
prepared for each of the ten districts covered under the project. Villages
proposed to be provided with water supplies have been identified and pertinent
data have been collected and summarized. However, as project implementation
proceeds, revisions regarding the villages to be covered under the project are
expected to occur and RWSSB would submit to IDA for review the proposed imple-
mentation program for each FY by each preceding March 1. The detailed engineer-
ing design will be ongoing through 1983 and IDA will, during the course of
project implementation, review sample schemes.
3.27      Reports on feasibility studies with preliminary engineering for the
project cities (water supply and sewerage) have been appraised. The detailed
engineering will be executed by PHED regarding transmission and distribution
mains and by consultants regarding major water works components. For works
to be executed through 1981, consultants have been appointed, and for works
to be executed thereafter, consultants would be appointed by April 1, 1981.
The detailed design would be completed by end-1982.
3.28      In order to assist in the maintenance of the construction schedule,
documents for immediate procurement requirements and for two treatment plants
(Jaipur and Kota) have been submitted to IDA for review.
3.29      The PHED must be strengthened to be able to cope with the increased
workload (para 5.11). In order to maintain the schedule in project processing,
the following number of additional divisions have been sanctioned in the Plan-
ning and Design Department: (i) four divisions for the processing of rural
water supply schemes and five divisions for the four project cities; and
(ii) two divisions for procurement and material management.
3.30      CPM networks for project implementation have been prepared by con-
sultants and a project implementation schedule is shown on Chart 21142. The
same consultant has been appointed to prepare project monitoring and reporting
systems. The system would commence functioning starting January 1, 1981.
Project monitoring would also include reports of selected technical and finan-
cial performance indicators, formats for which have been submitted by RWSSB
(Annex 4).
3.31      For future extension (1984 or beyond) of the water supply systems in
Jaipur and Jodhpur, consultants are expected to be appointed by April 1, 1982,
for the preparation of feasibility studies, and preliminary engineering. A
consultant would also be appointed to prepare a health education program by
March 31, 1982 in order to achieve envisaged health benefits under the project.
3.32      Operational standards are expected to improve gradually during the
project implementation period. Initial emphasis will be put on (i) metering
for controlling water produced and consumed, (ii) commencement of a waste
detection program, and (iii) improvements in billing and collection.

Procurement
3.33      Annex 1, Table 11 shows material and equipment (M&E) requirements,
cost estimates, assumed number of contracts and average contract sizes.
Contracts for material and equipment would be awarded on the basis of (i)
international competitive bidding (ICB) for an estimated value of about US$65
million in accordance with IDA "Guidelines for Procurement" and (ii) local
competitive bidding (LCB) for an estimated value of US$15 million in accordance
with acceptable local procurement procedures. LCB is recommended for concrete
and stoneware pipes because of fragility and high transportation costs and for
such other small items (contracts below US$150,000) which would not attract
foreign bidders, will be needed in annual deliveries and are more suitable for
decentralized procurement.
3.34      The total value of civil works under the project is estimated at
US$52 million equivalent. Because of the dispersed nature of the project and
the limited possibilities of grouping the contracts there would be about 400
contracts in rural areas and 80 in urban areas. One contract only would
exceed US$6 million equivalent, the Jodhpur raw water main, which is estimated
at US$26 million equivalent including the cost for the pipe to be cast in situ.
The average size of other contracts would be about US$50,000 in rural areas and
about US$300,000 in urban areas. The majority of the contracts would comprise
labor intensive pipe laying works. Under these circumstances, LCB would be
appropriate for all civil works and is recommended, except for the Jodhpur raw
water main for which ICB is proposed. Overall, the contracting industry is
well developed in Rajasthan and in India and would be adequate, and works will
be executed by force account only in unusual cases. Force account work, when
needed, with a cost of less than US$30,000 equivalent may be undertaken
without prior approval by IDA.
3.35      For ICB for material and equipment, a domestic preference of 15%
or the import duty, whichever is lower, is proposed to be applied in bid
evaluation. For ICB for civil works, a domestic preference of 7.5% is pro-
posed. Local bidding procedures are satisfactory. It is recommended that
local procurement would include the award of contracts to suppliers with whom
the Directorate General for Supply and Disposal (DGS&D) of GOI has entered
into annual rate contracts after bidding. The contracts (ICB and LCB) will be
suitably grouped to secure the advantages of economies of scale, but for the
initial requirements, it is envisaged that RWSSB may enter into some smaller
contracts via DGS&D procedures to expedite the commencement of construction
works.
3.36      It is recommended that IDA should review:  (i) all documents and
proposed awards for material and equipment for contract values exceeding
US$150,000 equivalent; and (ii) documents and proposed awards for civil works
for contract values exceeding US$500,000 equivalent. This would cover about
90% of material and equipment costs (about US$84 million equivalent) and 60%
of civil works costs (about US$30 million equivalent). A selected review of
other contract awards would be made prior to disbursement.



- 19 -
Disbursements
3.37      It is recommended that the proposed IDA credit should be disbursed
as follows: (i) for equipment and material contracts, 100% of foreign expendi-
tures (c.i.f. costs) for directly imported goods or 100% of local expenditures
(ex-factory) for locally manufactured goods, or 35% of local expenditures for
goods procured locally; (ii) for civil works, 100% of foreign expenditures
and 35% of local expenditures (including force account works); and (iii) 100%
of consultant and training costs. A quarterly disbursement forecast is shown
in Annex 1, Table 12.
3.38      Disbursement would be made against statements of expenditures for
progress payments in respect of civil works and material and equipment not
exceeding Rs 300,000 (US$35,700 equivalent) and Rs 150,000 (US$17,900 equiv-
alent), respectively. Relevant documents would be retained by RWSSB to be
subject to regular local auditing to be available for review by IDA during
project supervision. The institutional capacity after the introduction of
appropriate accounting systems would be satisfactory for these disbursement
procedures. Retroactive financing to an amount not exceeding US$500,000
equivalent is recommended for the costs of consultant services incurred after
May 1, 1979.
IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Financial Performance
4.01      The PHED, as a department of State Government, has maintained
Government type accounts rather than accounts under a double-entry, accrual
accounting system. For the appraisal they have, however, restated these cash
accounts in a commercial manner and have produced proforma financial state-
ments. These statements relate separately to PHED's water supply operations
in the urban and rural areas of the State. Proforma sewerage financial
statements have been developed from records made available by the munici-
palities of Jaipur, Jodhpur and Bikaner.
4.02      Prior to fiscal year 1980, revenues from water supply operations in
urban areas did not cover operating costs as tariffs were too low. Effective
April 1, 1979, tariffs were increased. As a result of this action, It is
estimated that PHED operations will approximately breakeven for the fiscal
year 1980. Annex 1, Table 13 provides a detailed income statement for the
fiscal years 1978 and 1979 based on proforma accounts and an estimated income
statement for the fiscal year 1980 based on a restatement of the annual
departmental budget. A summary of these three years' activities follows:

Total Operating Expenses         87.1       99.5        119.6
Operating Deficit                 (25.7)    (31.2)          (0.6)
4.03      The water supply services in the 26 rural districts have also
operated at a loss in the past even without giving consideration to depre-
ciation as an operating expense. The primary reason for this is that GOR
had followed a practice of not charging the consumers in the villages for
standpost water. Annex 1, Table 16 provides a detailed income statement for
the fiscal years 1978 to 1980. A summary of these three years' activities
follows:

Present Financial Position
4.04      Annex 1, Tables 15 and 18 provide the estimated financial po-
sition at March 31, 1980 for PHED's urban and rural water supply operations
respectively. The debt-equity ratio, applicable to urban operations only, at
34/66 would be acceptable. The current ratios of 1.7 for urban, and 1.1 for
rural, would also be acceptable as of that date, considering that PHED's
operations are as a department of Government where all expenditures are met by
Government. The estimated financial position at March 31, 1980 is summarized
as follows:

4.05       On July 25, 1979, the GOR appointed a committee to review the valua-
tion of the fixed assets of PHED. Under the direction of this committee the
fixed assets were physically verified and valued at their historical cost.
The valuation methods reflect Indian standard accounting practices and were
discussed and informally accepted by the Accountant General; the study was
completed and the final report has been issued. The resulting figures will
be utilized in the establishment of RWSSB's opening Balance Sheet as of
April 1, 1980.
Revenues and Tariffs
4.06       The details of current tariffs are set out in Annex 1, Table 19.
Effective April 1, 1979, the net tariffs for all urban areas were increased
to Rs 0.80 per thousand liters for domestic consumers, Rs 1.20 per thousand
liters for Commercial (1-1/2 times domestic) and Rs 1.60 per thousand liters
for Industrial (twice domestic). These are among the highest water tariffs in
India.
4.07       The financial projections for the urban areas (see Annex 1, Table
13) anticipate additional annual increases in all fiscal years from 1981
through 1987. These projected increases would raise the average domestic rate
(per thousand liters) in all urban areas of the state except Jodhpur to Rs 0.85
in FY1981, Rs 0.90 in FY1982, Rs 0.95 in FY1983, Rs 1.05 in FY1984, Rs 1.15 in



- 22 -
FY1985, Rs 1.30 in FY1986 and Rs 1.40 in FY1987. For projection purposes,
due to high investment costs, the tariffs for Jodhpur has been set at twice
the rate in the other cities in the fiscal year 1985.
4.08      The sewer systems, which will be transferred to RWSSB/PHED by April 1,
1981, currently are operated by the municipalities from general funds and no
billings have been made to users. GOR believes that the sewerage system should
be self-supporting and plans to introduce sewerage charges from April 1, 1981.
For projection purposes, these have been computed at 40% of the water charge
through fiscal year 1985 and 50% thereafter. IDA obtained assurances from GOR
that a sewerage charge would be introduced by April 1, 1981. It is expected
that this change would reflect the tariff study (para 4.10) and be applicable
to all premises with a water connection and within a prescribed distance from
a sewer main.
4.09      The loans being proposed to finance sewer connections and basic
plumbing installation costs for lower income groups (para 3.06) would be
interest-free to families with monthly household income to Rs 600 and with 4%
interest to families with monthly household incomes from Rs 601 to Rs 1,200.
The repayment period of these loans would be ten years. GOR agreed to develop
a detailed program to administer this consumer credit, acceptable to IDA, by
December 31, 1980.
4.10      RWSSB has appointed a consultant to conduct a more comprehensive
tariff study. Decisions based on this study should be made effective by
April 1, 1981 concerning:
(i)  the introduction of a block tariff structure and related
tariff levels;
(ii)  the magnitude of the sewerage charge developed as a per-
centage of the water charge; and
(iii)  the extent to which tariffs should be uniform in urban
areas or be adjusted to reflect particular local costs
and conditions.
4.11       In rural areas no charge has been levied for standpost water supply
and the charges for water connections are on a flat rate basis (Rs 8 per month
from fiscal year 1975). GOR plans to make rural water supply self-sufficient
by increasing the flat rate for connections and by introducing a standpost
water supply charge. The local bodies would then be responsible for paying
RWSSB for the service. The charges for each individual scheme would be based
on the population and the procedures for its collection would be adjusted to
meet particular local conditions.
4.12      This approach is largely untested and some collection problems can
be anticipated. In case of default the funds will be made available through
the Development Department from grant-in-aid funds earmarked for the default-
ing local body or from any other appropriate source.



- 23 -
4.13      The GOR has approved the conditions which will apply to rural
water supply and will provide the necessary rulings to make these conditions
effective. These conditions will include:
(i) the requirement for the local body to contribute the
equivalent of 2.5% of the total construction costs
except for a minor amount of deserving cases where
the voiding of this requirement will be communicated
to IDA;
(ii)  the introduction of water charges sufficient to cover
operation and maintenance costs from April 1, 1981. It
would appear that this would require a standpost water
charge equivalent to Rs 1 per person per month and a
flat rate charge for connection of Rs 10 per month;
(iii) the authorizing of the local body to collect the stand-
post water charges; and
(iv)  in the event experience shows that the proposed level of
collection for standpost water is not possible, State
Government budget allocations will be made available
through the Development Department of the State Govern-
ment to cover the shortfall within 120 days of initial
billing.
Assurance that these conditions would be applied was obtained from GOR.
4.14      GOR has assured IDA that it intends to introduce a standpost water
supply charge in urban areas effective January 1, 1981, equivalent to Rs 1 per
person per month for that portion of the population using the standpost water
supply, to be paid by the municipality to PHED. GOR intends to obtain funds
for this purpose by placing a 15% surcharge on the Octroi and depositing the
daily collections in the RWSSB's account. If this is not possible, the muni-
cipalities will have to meet these obligations from their General Funds. In
the event that any municipality does not make payment within 120 days of
billing, GOR will make funds available to meet the shortfall through its
Self-Government Department.
Future Financial Performance
4.15      Forecast Income Statements for urban operations for fiscal years
1981-88 are shown in Annex 1, Table 13. Assumptions utilized in these pro-
jections are shown in Annex 2. Significant measures of RWSSB/PHED's financial
performance during the project period, which are considered satisfactory,
are indicated below:

4.16      As the water rates in Rajasthan are comparatively high when compared
with other areas of India and per capita income is low, the proposed average
rates used in the urban projections have been designed to barely meet debt
servicing requirements except that in fiscal year 1985 the rates in Jodhpur
have been increased substantially to reflect that city's high investment
costs. Since India does not recognize the revaluation of assets, this earnings
requirement has been equated to a historical cost rate of return. IDA obtained
assurances from GOR that tariffs will be set to ensure the following earnings
performances in the urban areas:
(i)  for fiscal year 1981, to produce at least revenue adequate
to cover operations and maintenance costs and debt service
(or depreciation, if greater);
(ii)  for fiscal year 1982, after the commercial accounting
system has been installed, to produce a rate of return
of 2% on net fixed assets;
(iii)  for fiscal year 1983, to produce a rate of return of 3%;
(iv)  for fiscal year 1984, to produce a rate of return of 5%; and
(v)  for fiscal year 1985 and thereafter, to produce a rate
of return of 8%.
4.17      Annex 1, Table 20 provides summary income statements and perform-
ance indicators for the water and sewerage operations in each of the project
cities and for the total water operations in the ten project rural districts.

These statements reflect acceptable performance with a composite earnings
position for the project's urban area greater than that required of RWSSB/PHED
as a whole. The rates of return for Jodhpur are influenced by the significant
value of older plant and the doubling of the tariff in FY1985. Bikaner's
lower rate of rate reflects the insignificant value of older plant and the
application of the overall average tariff, while Kota's very high return
reflects the substantial amount of older plant.
4.18      Annex 1, Table 16 provides income statements for rural water
supply operations for the combined 26 rural districts which assumes the
recommended charge of one rupee per head per month for the standpost water
service. Since construction funds are provided by GOR as a grant, there is
no requirement for revenue levels exceeding cash operating expenses. There-
fore the projected earning position is acceptable.
Financing Plan
4.19      Funds Flow Statements appear as Annex 1, Table 14 for urban and
Annex 1, Table 17 for rural. RWSSB/PHED is expected to meet its debt service
and working capital requirements from cash generation from operations and other
customer payments. RWSSB/PHED estimated financial requirement and financing
plan for capital investment for the project period FYs1980/85 is summarized
as follows:

Commercial Accounting System
4.20      Consultants had been also employed to design and install a commercial
accounting system by April 1, 1981. This system would supplement the existing
cash accounting system required by GOR, utilizing the source data and records
of the cash system to the greatest degree possible to provide accounts and
accounting records needed in a commercial system. The system would not pro-
vide for a separate cash account for RWSSB/PHED but it would provide for a
"drawing account" representing funds which have been generated through the
operations of RWSSB and which continue to be designated for its future use.
The system would also provide for the servicing of debt related to urban
schemes based on the following terms and conditions: 6.5% interest rate
with a 25 year term including a five years grace period.
Billing and Collection
4.21      PHED's billing and collection for customer connections appears to
have been reasonably effective in the past. However, adequate statistical
reports on customer balances, age of outstanding accounts and overall collec-
tion performance are not currently available in headquarters to fully evaluate
performance. With the introduction of the commercial accounting system
(para 4.20), the required data should be available to provide a positive
control on billing and collection performance. IDA obtained assurances from
RWSSB that adequate controls will be exercised to assure that the amount of
uncollected accounts does not exceed the value of three month's billings for
these accounts from FY1982.



- 27 -
4.22      The collection of standpost billings in the rural areas will prob-
ably be more difficult and portions of these billings may have to be referred
to the Development Department for payment from government budget funds. It
is anticipated that these referals will be made on a six month basis; conse-
quently, receivable balances for these accounts will tend to be larger than
for normal customer accounts. However, with effective collection practices
and proper follow-up, it is believed that these accounts can be kept to a
level of four months' billing for standpost water supply from FY1982. IDA
obtained such assurances from GOR.
Audit
4.23      The RWSSB/PHED's  commercial accounts will be subject to audit by
the Accountant General's office of the State of Rajasthan under delegation
from the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. The Accountant General
maintains a commercial audit group and has agreed to produce a commercial
type long-form audit report acceptable to IDA. Assurances were obtained
that RWSSB will submit audited statements of account to IDA within nine
months of the end of the fiscal year beginning with fiscal year 1981.
Insurance
4.24      RWSSB would prefer, as has been the practice in other government
undertakings, to follow the principle of self-insurance with GOR providing
funds for major casualty losses and to cover other risks as they occur.
This concept is acceptable.
V. THE IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATION AGENCY
Operating Arrangements
5.01      RWSSB/PHED will normally operate all water supply and sewerage works.
In the event of transfer of the responsibility for such works to the respec-
tive local body, an agreement between GOR and the local body would be required.
IDA obtained assurances from GOR that in case of transfer, such agreements to
be entered into would contain conditions related to servicing of debt, organi-
zation and staffing, and operational criteria to assure efficient operation
and management as outlined in para 5.05.
Organization
5.02      The operations of the sector was reorganized effective May 1, 1980
and is composed of three organizational levels--(i) the Committee of Direction;
(ii) RWSSB; and (iii) PHED. The Committee of Direction meets infrequently,
about every 6 months or at shorter intervals depending upon the requirements
of RWSSB. RWSSB is the management organ of the sector and would administer
the activities of PHED and provide the authority and flexibility necessary to
meet the day-to-day requirements of a commercially oriented entity.  RWSSB



- 28 -
would be composed of a Chairman 1/ of the rank of Secretary to Government,
who would also serve as Secretary to the Committee of Direction; a Technical
Advisor who would be the senior Chief Engineer of PHED, a full time Finance
Advisor and four ex-officio members from the Finance Department, the Plan-
ning Department, the Local Self Government Department and the Development
Department. Utilizing the facilities and staff of PHED, RWSSB would prepare
execute and operate schemes for water supply and sewage disposal; render all
necessary services in this regard; review and advise GOR on tariffs and ini-
tiate these tariffs after Government approval; enter into contracts, advance
loans to customers and incur expenditures deemed appropriate to water supply
and sewerage operations within established rules and budget limitations. GOR
would maintain its control on the activities of RWSSB through the Committee
of Direction, the ex-officio members of the Board, its prior approval of
budgets and tariff proposals, its concurrence in major policy decisions, its
sanctioning of higher grade positions and its appointment of senior manage-
ment. The responsibility for project implementation and works operation would
rest ultimately with the Chairman of the Board as chief executive officer of
RWSSB.
5.03      PHED would be organized on a functional basis with separate depart-
ments for project planning and design, works construction, works operation,
finance and administration. A tentative organizational proposal is shown on
Chart 21143. The departments, would be organized in circles composed of
divisions and sub-divisions. Each circle would have about five divisions.
There are at present 12 circles, 12 design divisions, 25 construction divisions
and 25 operational divisions.
5.04      The organization and development of works operation would enable
a later transfer of this function (para 1.11) to respective local bodies if,
in time, desirable. Related local organizations could be: (i) in urban areas
the establishment of separate water supply and sewerage entities either within
or attached to the municipal bodies; and (ii) in rural areas the establishment
of similar organizations for separate regional water supply schemes or on
sub-district or district levels.
5.05      In order to maintain a satisfactory operational standard the
following particular conditions should apply in case of transfer of
the operational function to a local body:
(i) establishment of a separate water supply and sewerage
entity with its head reporting directly to the Chief
Executive of the Local Body or an independent board;
(ii) a committee of the Local Body to be appointed with the
authority to recommend policy relating to water supply
and sewerage services;
1/   Whether the Chairman will be on a full time or part time basis would be
reviewed in consultation with IDA before December 31, 1980.



- 29 -
(iii) the maintenance of a commercial accounting system separate
from that of other local body activities with a separate
budget and bank account;
(iv)  all funds generated from water supply and sewerage services
to be first used to cover operational and maintenance costs,
debt service, working capital increases and necessary system
extensions; any surplus funds might be transferred for use in
other local activities;
(v) compliance with agreed technical and financial performance
indicators;
(vi)  appointment of staff with appropriate qualifications; and
(vii) cost recovery should meet acceptable financial requirements.
IDA obtained assurances from GOR that any transfer of the operational func-
tion for water supply and sewerage system from RWSSB to an urban local body
(a) would not, without IDA's agreement, take place before April 1, 1986;
this would ensure the establishment of uniform operational practice; (b)
would not involve any basic changes in the organizational and functional
pattern to be established by RWSSB; and (c) would be subject to conditions
similar to the above.
5.06      A deeper organizational study is required for RWSSB and consultants
are to be appointed by July 31, 1981 and would submit recommendations on
organizational structure by March 31, 1980. RWSSB would decide upon organi-
zational structure and commence its implementation by July 1, 1981.
Management and Personnel
5.07      The present number of professional staff in PHED in different
positions are: one chief engineer; one financial advisor; five additional
chief engineers; 12 superintending engineers; 71 executive engineers; 252
assistant engineers; 833 junior engineers; and 44 accountants. The present
total staff numbers about 11,000, making it one of the largest government
organizations in the State.
5.08      The PHED's staff is experienced in general design matters and in the
execution of construction works. This project has brought a new approach to
the preparation of water supply and sewerage schemes, which is expected to be
followed for other projects. With the introduction of cost recovery criteria
and with the increased number of schemes being commissioned, the operational
department will have to be expanded and further developed.
5.09      The projected increase in the work load during the project period
is significant. Difficulties in recruiting engineering personnel are not
expected as there is an adequate output of graduate engineers. Higher tech-
nical positions can be filled by internal promotions. Difficulties could
arise in the recruitment of accounting personnel since the salary level, which
is State Government regulated, cannot compete with that being offered in the



- 30 -
private sector. However, most accounting personnel will be provided by the
Accountant General thus limiting the extent of the recruiting difficulties.
In order to handle the increased work requirements while expanding the RWSSB
staff, increased consultant use will be necessary (para 3.17).
5.10      A thorough study is required on manpower and staffing and consul-
tants would be appointed by July 31, 1980 (the same one as under para 5.06).
RWSSB would decide upon a staffing recruitment schedule and commence its
implementation by July 1, 1981.
Training
5.11      PHED does not have a regular training program.  The engineering
and operational staff are trained on-the-job after recruitment or reassign-
ment. In the process of project preparation and implementation through con-
sultant involvement, training has occurred in various design matters. The
accountant consultant (para 4.20) will include in his assignment the training
of staff in the development of commercial accounting systems and in financial
management. The consultant assignment (para 3.30) for project monitoring and
reporting systems will also include training of staff.
5.12      A training consultant has been appointed, for the preparation of
an overall training program. By April 1, 1981, a training unit, adequately
staffed, would be established within RWSSB and the training program would
begin to be implemented.
VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Marginal Cost Analysis
6.01      The marginal costs for water supply (per m 3) and sewerage (per
connection) at a 10% discount rate in the four project cities have been
computed as below. No marginal cost analysis has been made for rural areas.
Jaipur   Jodhpur   Kota   Bikaner
Water SI3pply
-  Rs/m                             0.7       3.2      1.3      1.9
-  USHlm                            8.0     38.0      15.0    23.0
Sewerage
-  Rs/connection and month         10.0      14.0       -      27.0
-  US$/connection and month         1.19      1.67      -       3.21
6.02      The marginal costs for water vary significantly between the four
cities.  The Jodhpur cost is very high, mainly because of a very expensive raw
water main, and similarly the Bikaner cost is comparatively high, mainly
because of the need to change from a groundwater to a surface water source.



- 31 -
The marginal cost per sewer connection is significantly higher in Bikaner than
in Jaipur and Jodhpur, mainly because of the requirement to lay an almost
complete system, since there are few existing facilities.
Pricing Considerations
_~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
6.03      The projected tariff levels in urban areas for water supply (Rs/m )
and sewerage (Rs as an average per connection and month) are as follows (paras
4.07 and 4.08):
FY                      1981    1982    1983    1984    1985    1986
-  Jaipur, Kota, Bikaner   0.85    0.90    0.95    1.05    1.15    1.30
-  Jodhpur                   0.85    0.90    0.95    1.05    2.30    2.30
Sewerage
-  Jaipur                     -      14.0    15.0    16.0    18.0    25.0
-  Jodhpur                    -      11.0    12.0    13.0    27.0    35.0
-  Bikaner                    -      11.0    12.0    13.0    14.0    20.0
6.04      An analysis of the projected water and sewerage tariffs as compared
to the marginal costs indicates that:  (i) the water in Jaipur is priced above
marginal cost and in Kota the tariff level would about equal marginal cost by
FY1986; (ii) the water in Bikaner and Jodhpur are, despite heavy tariff in-
creases in Jodhpur, priced significantly below marginal cost; (iii) the
sewerage service in Jaipur and Jodhpur (after 1985) are priced above marginal
cost, while for Bikaner, the price is significantly below the marginal cost.
These questions will be further analyzed in the proposed tariff study (para
4.10). The marginal cost would, if it cannot be achieved as an average
rate, be applied in a block tariff structure for water used exceeding a
certain amount.
6.05      An analysis has been made of the beneficiaries' ability to pay the
water supply and sewerage charges, which has taken into account: (i) avail-
able statistics on household expenditures; (ii) assumed pattern of water con-
sumption in various income groups; and (iii) a tentative block tariff structure.
The water supply and sewerage costs as a percentage of household expenditures
were measured for three years (1981, 1982 and 1986) and are summarized below
for the income group representing the second lowest 20% of the population (the
lowest 20% use standpost water). By FY1982, the sewerage charge would be
imposed and, by FY1986, the requirement for payment of debt services would
begin. In the income group below 20% there would be few water connections and
hardly any sewer connections:
Fiscal Year          1981      1982       1986
Jaipur              3.0       3.6        4.5
Jodhpur             2.0       2.2        5.8
Kota                2.9       2.5        2.8
Bikaner             2.3       2.7        3.3



- 32 -
6.06      The water and sewerage tariff levels are comparatively high, but
when taking into account the percentage they represent of household expendi-
tures, they would still be within the beneficiaries' capacity to pay. The
high charge for Jodhpur must be accepted considering the severe water scarcity
situation in that area.
Incremental Financial Rate of Return
6.07      The incremental financial rate of return, individually and combined,
for the project towns are summarized as follows:
Water Supply          Sewerage           Total
Jaipur                 9.3                   6.4              8.3
Jodhpur               (1.2)                 20.5              0.7
Kota                   4.8                    -               4.8
Bikaner                5.6                   3.2              5.0
Total (combined)       3.6                   8.5              4.2
If labor is valued at 75% of market, the combined rate would be 5.8% (instead
of 4.2%).  A sensitivity analysis shows that with a 10% increase in both
capital and operational costs the rate of return (combined) would be 2.2% for
water, 7.2% for sewerage and 2.7% for water and sewerage together.
6.08      The above rates of return are comparatively low overall, which,
however, is very much affected by the Jodhpur water supply scheme. Excluding
Jodhpur, the rate of return (combined) would be 6.8% for water and 6.5% for
water and sewerage together, which would be reasonable. The overall rate
would therefore be acceptable since for Jodhpur there is no other feasible
alternative and no further increases of the tariff levels would be practicable.
Project Benefits and Impact on Poverty Groups
6.09      The financial rates of return do not reflect such benefits that
accrue from a water supply and sewerage project but cannot readily be
quantified.
6.10      Major benefits that have not been quantified could be summarized
as follows:
(i)  the provision of water supplies in rural areas relieves a
significant manpower input, presently occupied transporting
water from remote water sources, for other productive
functions required for rural development;
(ii)  the provision of water supplies favorably stimulates indus-
trial developments and subsequent creation of employment
opportunities;
(iii)  the use of safe water and proper sanitation facilities
improves health conditions, increases productivity and
reduces medical and hospital costs; and



- 33 -
(iv)  particularly in Rajasthan, the reduction of the use of
water infected by guineaworm or containing excessive
fluoride would, besides health benefits, have a signi-
ficant social impact.
6.11      The project's rural component representing about 43% of total
project cost for water supply, is mainly directed toward the provision of
standpost water supply and would primarily meet the needs of rural poverty
groups. The urban water supply systems would predominantly be for water
connections, which because of a structured tariff would be affordable to
most income groups, with standposts mainly concentrated to unauthorized
development areas.
6.12      Any sewerage system will have to be extended gradually for economical
reasons but where sewer mains are being laid the total population would be
in a position to connect to the system. Under the project the proportion of
the sewerage component for covering loans for connection and basic plumbing
installation costs (para 4.09) is about 25% and would directly benefit the
lower income groups:
Project Merits and Risks
6.13      The project embodies a sectorwide approach.  It should have a
significant impact on the institutional development of the water supply
and sewerage sector and on the provision of water supply and sewerage services
to the entire State. Specialization will be created in engineering planning
and design which would improve the quality of project preparation. Cost
recovery systems will be established which will make the sector less dependent
on State Government contributions and make adequate funds available for
proper system operation.
6.14      The GOR sector development plan (paras 1.22 and 1.23) is very
ambitious and a considerable effort will be required for its implementation;
therefore, the possibilities of delays cannot be excluded. The project,
however, covers only 54% of the plan and, with appropriate consultant assis-
tance, adequate resources can be made available to ensure its completion
within the project period.
6.15      The proposed cost recovery system for rural areas is largely untested
and the revenue collection from standpost water supply users might not be
realized as projected. Consequently, any shortfalls for covering operational
and maintenance costs would have to be covered from State Government budget
allocations and scarce funds would have to be diverted from other important
rural development activities. In the extreme case that no standpost water
supply charges would be realized, the required State Government subsidy by
FY1985 would amount to about Rs 111 million, which would correspond to about
32% of projected capital investments for rural water supply for the same year.

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations agreements were reached with GOR on the follow-
ing major points:
(i) allocation of water from Jewai impoundment to Jodhpur
(para 3.09);

RAJASTHAN WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Assumption for Financial Projection
1.        Financial projections for RWSSC have been prepared for the fiscal
year 1981 through 1988 using the budget figures for the base fiscal year
1980.
Income Statement
Urban Revenues
2.        Domestic water connection were developed from population served
as provided in the service level report.
3.        Unmetered connections have been gradually reduced to achieve complete
meterization by FY1985.
4.        Water consumption has been based on service level reports with
average day demand (domestic consumption) assumed at 80% of the maximum day
demand.
5.        Water rates utilized except for Jodhpur are shown on Annex 1,
Table 13. Special rates used for Jodhpur are Rs 2.30 in FY1985/86 and Rs 2.40
in FY1987/88.
6.        Miscellaneous revenues have been computed at Rs 5 per connection.
7.        Domestic sewer connections were developed from population served
provided in service level report.
8.        Sewerage rates have been assumed at 40% of water rates for FY's 1982
through 1985 and at 50% for FY's 1986 through 1988.
9.        Sale of sewage has been estimated at Rs 8,825 per million M3 for 60%
of the sewage flow.
10.       Interest on connection loans has been estimated at 4% with a recovery
period of ten years and equal monthly payments (representing both interest and
principal).
Urban Expense
11.       Inflation has been assumed at an annual rate of 10% for FY1981, 7%
for FY's 1982 through 1984 and 5% for FY's 1985 through 1988.

ANNEX 2
Page 2
12.       Basic figures for expense categories, Salary and Wages, Power and
Fuel, Raw Water and Chemicals have been developed by the technical staff of
PHED based on operating requirements and have been reviewed and determined
reasonable. The basis figures were then inflated in accordance with the
inflation assumption. Basic salaries include a factor for the 8.33% bonus
which was deemed to be required under the corporate structure. However,
there is some evidence that a bonus requirement will eventually be necessary
despite the organizational structure. Therefore, to be conservative, the
effect of the bonus has been retained in the projected accounts.
13.       Maintenance materials for water supply have been projected as a
percentage of average gross plant in operation. The rate is expected to
decline from 2.25% in FY1981 to 1.50% in FY1988. For sewerage, the rate is
assumed constant at 0.75%.
14.       Headquarter expense has been calculated at 10% of total operating
expenses exclusive of other expenses and depreciation.
15.       Other expenses have been calculated at 10% of salary and wages.
16.       Depreciation for water supply has been computed at 3% of the
average gross plant in operations during the FY and for sewerage at 2-1/2%.
17.       Interest on project loans has been computed at 6-1/2% with a
payment period of twenty-five years including five years of grace and equal
semi-annual payments of interest and principals).
18.       Interest on other loans is in accordance with agreements and
schedules.
Rural Revenues
19.       Numbers of connections have been developed by dividing population
served by 8, the average number per family.
20.       Water rates are shown on Annex 1, Table 16.
Rural Expense - (Same as urban except for following)
21.       Maintenance materials have been computed as 1% of average gross
plant in operation.
Balance Sheets - Urban
22.       Plant under construction represents the estimated current years'
construction.
23.       Accounts receivable have been assumed at two months' billings.



- 58 -
ANNEX 2
Page 3
24.       Inventories have been assumed to represent a four month supply based
on estimated annual usage of maintenance materials.
25.       Grants represent funds received from Municipal Boards, housing
societies for capital works.
26.       Previous loans represent LIC loans.
27.       Customer deposits were computed at Rs 25 per connection.
28.       Accounts payable were computed at 1/12 annual cash expenditures for
both assets and expense less salary and wages which are paid in the month
earned.
Balance Sheet - Rural (Same as urban except for following)
29.       Accounts receivable have been assumed to represent four months'
billings.
