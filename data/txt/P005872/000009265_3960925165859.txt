PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN'
SEIYUN REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (CREDIT 1418-YDR)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Seiyun Regional Water
Supply Project in the Republic of Yemen, for which Credit 1418-YDR in the amount
of SDR 6.5 million (US $7.0 million equivalent) was approved on November 29,
1983. The Credit was closed on December 31, 1989, oLie year behind schedule.
It was fully disbursed and the last disbursement was made on June 1, 1990.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Division, Department III of
the Europe, Middle East and North Africa Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation
Summary, Parts I and III), and the Borrower (Part II). The Arab Fund for Social
and Economic Development co-financed the project.
Preparation of this PCR was started during IDA's final supervision mission
of the project in November 1989 and discussed with the Borrower during a PCR
mission in March 1990.  The PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal
Report; the Credit and Project Agreements; Supplemental Letters; supervision
reports; correspondence between IDA and the Borrower; and internal IDA memoranda.
I/The unification of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and the Yemen
Arab Republic took place on May 22, 1990, which is after the project's
completion. This project is located in the former People's Democratic Republic
of Yemen, the Southern Region of the newly formed Republic of Yemen.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
The Seiyun Regional Water Supply Project was the fourth IDA lending
operation for water supply to the former People's Democratic Republic of Yemen.
The objectives of the project were to: (i) provide sufficient water of good
quality to meet the existing deficit and to increase water production to meet
the demand in the Greater Seiyun area up to 1995; (ii) improve the Public Water
Corporation's (PWC) operations and maintenance procedures through the provision
of technical assistance and training; (iii) strengthen PWC's financial position;
and (iv) establish an operational branch of PWC at Seiyun (para 3.01).  The
project aimed to build upon ongoing initiatives in other IDA water supply
projects. Overall, these objectives were met and even exceeded (Part I, paras.
6.01 to 6.08): the actual population served from the new water supply system is
26X higher than the appraisal estimates. PWC's financial performance remains
satisfactory in spite of the 1988 take-over of four inefficiently operated
municipal systems.   The detailed designs of the Upper Tuban Wellfield and
Transmission Pipeline to Bir Nasr were used as a basis for the Greater Aden
Second Water Supply Project (Credit 1739-YDR). Similarly, the Tarim feasibility
study and detailed designs prepared under this project were used in connection
with the Tarim Water Supply Project (Credit 2170-ROY).
ImDlementation Experience
Project execution was generally satisfactory in spite of the necessity to
extend by one year the original Closing Date of December 31, 1988 (Part I, paras.
5.01 to 5.03, Part III, Section 4, and Annexes I and 2). Two of the main factors
which led to implementation delays were beyond PWC's control, namely the civil
disturbances of January 1986, and the shortfall in foreign financing which
resulted from foreign exchange fluctuations (which were ultimately met by the
Borrowcr).  In general, the Borrower was in compliance with Credit and Project
Agreement covenants, albeit with some delays (Part III, Section 7).
Results
The project was successful in meeting its principal objective of providing
adequate water supply of good quality to meet the demand of the Greater Seiyun
conurbation (Part I, paras. 6.01 to 6.08 and Part III, Section 6).   A new
operational branch was established at Seiyun, and PWC's financial condition
remains strong (Annex 3).



iii
Sustainability
The Seiyun Branch has been operational for almost two years and is staffed
in accordance with the agreed upon organizational and administrative structure
(Part I, paras. 7.01 to 7.03).  It is PWC's intention that the Seiyun Branch
gradually take on greater responsibility for the provision of water supply in
the outlying and smaller rural villages in the upper Wadi Hadramawt. In addition
to PWC's plan for the Seiyun Branch to take-over operation and maintenance of
two larger towns with a total population of over 31,000 inhabitants, the town
of Tarim located 25 kilometers from Seiyun will also eventually become a sub-
branch of Seiyun.
Findings and Lessons Learned
The principal lessons learned from the experience gained dur5ng project
implementation are (Part I, parL. 10):
(i)   continued attention should be given to water supply sector training
in operations and management. The country-wide shortage of qualified
technical staff means that PWC will need to continue to employ
consultants for construction supervision to assist in undertaking
major capital projects.   Based on the conclusions of a study
undertaken by the World Health Organization in connection with Credit
1944-YDR, PWr. has prepared a five-year manpower development program.
Under Credit 2170-ROY, PWC has agreed to commence a manpower
development program by December 31, 1991;
(ii)  although physical implementation targets were met, more attention
needs to be paid to utilizing progress reports and monitoring
indicators as a basis for discussion on areas where managerial and
operational efficiency improvements could be made;
(iii) procurement  schedules  should be designed to reflect realistic
timeframes for completing the various prccurement procedures; and
(iv)  in the future, PWC will need to focus on improving its operational
and administrative efficiency through: (a) the reduction of
unaccounted-for-water; and (b) introducing computerized billing,
financial and management information systems.   The Greater Aden
Second Water Supply Project (Credit 1739-YDR) and the Al Mukalla
Water Supply Project (Credit 1944-YDR) include components to carry
out a leak detection and repair program in Greater Aden and undertake
an operational efficiency improvement study in Al Mukalla,
respectively. Computerization of billing and accounting functions
is being initiated under Credit 1944-YDR. Credit 2170-ROY includes
components aimed at establishing management information systems and
executing a three-year intensive metering program.

Name:              Seiyun Regional Water Supply Project
Credit Number:    1418-YDR
RVP Unit:          EMENA Region
Country:           Republic of Yemen
Sector:           Water Supply
2.    Background
2.01 The Seiyun Regional Water Supply Project was IDA's fourth lending operation
for water supply to the former People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY).
IDA's involvement in the sector began with a Credit for Water Supply Engineering
(Credit S-021-YDR) aimed at formulating a program of projects for the country's
three major urban centers and assisting the Public Water Corporation (PWC) to
improve its organizational structure and operational efficiency. Two previous
water supply projects in Aden (Credit 1038-YDR) and Al Mukalla (Credit 1159-
YDR) focussed on increasing water production, improving water quality and
rehabilitating and expanding the existing networks. The third largest urban
center which required urgent attention was Seiyun where the quantity of water
was insufficient to meet demand and the quality of water was unsafe for drinking.
2.02 The Seiyun Regional Water Supply Project was designed to support the
Government's objectives in the water supply sector, namely to: (i) provide
sufficient quantities of safe drinking water to inhabitants in the major urban
areas; (ii) strengthen the institutional capacity of PWC through the adoption
of sound technical, financial and operational policies; and (iii) attract
financial concessionary aid to support development of the sector given the severe
limitation of financial resources.   These objectives were in line with the
Government's overall development strategy of: (i) satisfying the basic needs of
the population; (ii) developing the productive base of the economy; (iii)
strengthening basic infrastructure in transport and public utilities; and (iv)
improving the efficiency of public sector institutions and manpower training.
3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.01 The project represented the first construction stage of a long-term water
supply master plan for the central Wadi Hadramawt region and involved the tapping
and distribution of water from a deep aquifer. The existing shallow aquifer
could not meet water demand in the Seiyun conurbation and was contaminated and
unfit for consumption. The main objective of the project was to provide adequate
water supply of good quality to meet the demand of the Greater Seiyun area up



2
to the year 1995.   The per capita cons., iption was projected to increase
progressively to 85 liters per day by 1995, or more than double the level of
consumptior estimated at appraisal.   As the then existing system was almost
obsolete, the project also called for the installation of a new primary
distribution network in the Seiyun area.  In view of the expanded production
capacity to be generated by the project and the resultant increase in wastewater
disposal, the project included the detailed design of sanitation systems in
Seiyun.  At the corporate level, the project also aimed to further strengthen
PWC's financial position through the introduction of a stronger cash generation
covenant, which obligated PWC to generate revenueF sufficient to cover operation
and maintenance costs plus 12 percent of its three-year annual average of capital
expenditures. Another objective w^s to establish an operational branch of PWC
in Seiyut. and provide technical assistance and training to PWC staff. At the
project preparation stage, PWC had already created an office in Seiyun to: (i)
extend technical and financial assistance to the 13 existing private water
enterprises that had been experiencing technical and operational difficulties
in providing their services to the population; and (ii) implement small water
supply projects in Shibam and Al Qatn being financed by the Government and IDA
under the Wadi Hadramawt Agricultural Development Project (Credit 615-YDR).
3.02 The project consisted of the following components:
(i)   the drilling and equipping of a wellfield in Seiyun to yield a
maximum flow of 100 litres per second;
(ii)   the construction of a 2,700 m3 reservoir in Seiyun;
(iii)   laying of a primary water distribution system in Seiyun;
(iv)   provision of secondary water distribution networks in Seiyun;
(v)   construction of transmission pipelines from Seiyun to neighboring
villages;
(vi)   laying of water distribution networks in the neighboring villages;
(vii)   the construction of a PWC branch office and warehouse in Seiyun;
(viii)   the provision of operational equipment and about 6,500 water meters;
(ix)   consultant services for:  (a) construction supervision;  (b) the
detailed design of a second construction stage of the water supply
master plan for Greater Aden; (c) the feasibility study and design
of a water supply system for the Tarim area; and (d) preparation of
detailed sanitation plans for Seiyun; and
(x)   management assistance and training for PWC staff.
4.    Project Design and Organization
4.01  Both the project concept and design were clear and unambiguous.  At the



3
time of appraisal in September 1982, the project was phased to accommodate the
interest of the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development to finance the
second stage works, for which financial assistance was not likely to be made
available until mid-1984. However, the Arab Fund acted quickly, and a loan of
US $6.8 million equivalent to support the project was signed with the Government
on December 27, 1983.   The fiist priority under the project was to provide
adequate water supply to Seiyun town, followed by the construction of a trunk
main, distribution system and storage reservoirs to the outlying 39 small
villages.  Due to close and fruitful coordination between PWC, the Arab Fund and
IDA, implementation of both phases of the project proceeded simultaneously.
here was one main improvement in design which was made at an ea,ly stage in
project implementation; namely, a booster station was deleted from the project
and water was provided to the Northern and Southwestern villages by gravity.
This was accomplished by raising the height of a reservoir and increasing the
pipe size in certain areas.
4.02 The project was well prepared and based on a 1979 feasibility study
financed by the Government and updated in 1982. The scope of the project was
appropriate and also built on ongoing initiatives aimed at improving the
efficiency of PWC's operations. PWC officials indicated that the project had
been prepared in 1979, but was delayed due to the unavailability of foreign
financing. At the time of project appraisal, the quantity of water supply in
Seiyun was insufficient to meet current demand, and the quality of water had
deteriorated to the extent that it created a potentially serious health hazard
to the inhabitants of Seiyun. The water was saline and there was also evidence
of unusually high levels of nitrates and coliform bacteria. No comprehensive
sanitation system existed in the wadi and many soak pits were built close to
production wells, thus contaminating the shallow groundwater which was neither
chlorinated nor treated in any other way.
4.03  PWC was responsible for execution of the project which was managed by an
effective Project Implementation Unit (PIU) working directly under the General
Manager of PWC. The PIU consisted of PWC staff who had been assisting the 13
small private water enterprises in Seiyun in operations and maintenance, and in
execution of the rural water supply component under the Wadi Hadramawt
Agricultural Development Project (para. 3.01). The PIU was also responsible for
gathering data on Seiyun which was used as input in the appraisal process.  PWC
appointed an engineer and accountant to the PIU which was also supported by
foreign experts who assisted in construction supervision.  PWC adopted the agreed
upon organizational and administrative structure for the Seiyun branch office,
the nucleus of which consisted of staff from the PIU.   Overall,  project
management was effective and was a reflection of PWC's commitment to implement
the project.
5.    Proiect Implementation
5.01 The project was approved by the Board of Executive Directors on November
29, 1983 and signed on January 6, 1984. The Credit was declared effective on
March 16, 1984, and fully disbursed on June 1, 1990. The project was executed
successfully. The original Closing Date of the Credit was extended from December
31, 1988 by one year for the reasons described in para. 5.02. There were four



4
principal reasons for the delays in project implementation: (i) initial start-
up delays in the preparation and approval of procuiement documentation'; (ii) the
civil disturbances of January 1986 which caused about a three month delay due
to demobilization and remobilization of foreign contractors and consultants
emoloyed under the project; (iii) the shortfall in foreign financing which
deL. id the commencement and thus the completion of the secondary network to the
39 small surrounding villages including the procurement of operational equipment;
and (iv) late completion of the electrical and mechanical works by the main
contractor and the "as built" record drawings and manuals for the water supply
network. Annexes 1 and 2 provide details on planned and actual completion dates
for project components and a comparison between appraisal and actual physical
works constructed.
5.02 The main reasons for the extension of the original closing date by one
year to December 31, 1989 were to: (i) allow for the completion of the water
supply study for Tarim and the sanitation study for Seiyun; (ii) utilize
remaining funds in the Credit account to purchase operational equipment; and
(iii) allow for the one year maintenance period on civil, electrical and
mechanical works. It should be noted that even with a one year extension of the
closing date, this project was implemented in 6 years, as compared to the average
implementation period of 7.5 years for IDA projects in the former PDRY.
5.03 The factor that most seriously affected project implementation was the
appreciation of the Deutsche Mark (the currency denomination of the main contract
for civil, electrical and mechanical works) against the Special Drawing Rights
(SDR) and the Kuwaiti Dinar.  The price increase of the contract due to the
appreciation of the Deutsche Mark amounted to about YD 2 million, or US $5.8
million, and resulted in a foreign financing gap for the project. Instead of
deleting portions of the project, the procurement of operational equipment and
commencement of the secondary distribution network to Seiyun and the 39 small
surrounding villages was delayed. PWC was hesitant to commit additional funds
due to the existing shortfall in foreign financing, for which additional funds
from IDA or the Arab Fund could not be secured.   The Government eventually
increased its financial contribution to the project in order to finance the
secondary distribution network to the 39 surrounding villages (para. 6.03 and
Part III, Section 5). Since the Credit was fully disbursed, some operational
equipment (particularly water meters) is being ordered under other ongoing
projects.   This has delayed the metering of connections in Seiyun and the
surrounding villages, though the metering program is now expected to be completed
by December 1990.
'The implementation schedule in Annex 11 of the SAR indicated procurement
target dates which were unrealistic and should have been modified when Board
presentation was delayed by about five months to November 29, 1983. For example,
the implementation schedule shows that the actual drilling of boreholes should
have commenced by January 1, 1984. The Credit was only signed on January 6, 1984
(the project did not provide for retroactive financing). This schedule did not
allow adequate time for contract negotiations and signing or mobilization of
consultants.



5
6.    Prolect Results
6.01 Project Objectives. Overall, the project was successful in meeting its
principal objective of providing adequate water supply of good quality to meet
the demand of the Greater Seiyun conurbation.   A new operational branch was
established at Seiyun, and project-related training contributed to the general
managerial and operational development of PWC.
6.02 Physical Results. The physical achievements of the project as of December
31, 1989 were greater than planned as shown in the table below:
Parameter                SAR Estimate  Actual Results  % Increasg
Population Served               47,500            60,000         26.3%
Number of Connections             8,000            9,221         15.3%
Water Production (millions m3)  1.226             1.720         40.3%
At the end of 1989, 6,914 connections had been metered, with the balance of 2,307
service lines expected to be metered by the end of 1990.
6.03   Project Costs.   At the time of appraisal,  total project costs were
estimated at US $16.05 million equivalent.  Actual project costs of US $20.2
million equivalent were higher than appraisal estimates for the following main
reasons: (i) the appreciation of the Deutsche Mark (the currency denomination
of the main contract for civil, electrical and mechanical works) against the SDR
and the Kuwaiti Dinar (para. 5.03); (ii) the staff appraisal cost estimates for
the borefield equipment and pipeline, chlorination and generator building, system
storage, pumping stations and reservoirs were low; (iii) the inclusion of an
emergency generator butilding and a workshop, financed by IDA and the Arab Fund,
respectively, which were not envisaged at appraisal; and (iv) an increase in
secondary distribution system costs since the network was expanded to connect
more customers to the system than had been envisaged at appraisal (para. 6.02).
Actual primary distribution costs were lower than envisaged due to a design
improvement which reduced the length of the primary system.  More details Co
project costs and financing are presented in Part III, Section 5.
6.04  Financial Performance.   The consolidated financial statements for PWC
during 1983-89, including both appraisal estimates and actual results, are
attached as Annex 3.  Overall, PWC's actual financial performance compares
favorably with  appraisal  estimates.    PWC's  internal  cash  generation was
sufficient to cover operation and maintenance expenses, working capital
increases, debt service, and 12% of the average of its three-year annual capital
investment program.  This was due to a 40% increase in water tariffs effective
June 1986. PWC also maintained a debt service ratio well above 1.2. Although
PWC remains finarcially healthy, net income was substantially below appraisal
estimates for two reasons: (i) the volume of water produced and sold was less
than projected, which is mainly attributed to the significant tariff increase
in 1986 that led to water conservation; and (ii) the Government's tax rate on
corporate profits was increased to 85%, versus the appraisal estimate of 37.5%.
However, PWC's rate of return on average net fixed assets declined from 12.3%



6
in 1986 to 5.8% in 1989 mainly on account of the take-over of several small and
inefficient existing municipal systems. Such take-overs were not foreseen at
appraisal.
6.05 Since 1984 all public entities have been required to set aside, in a
Capital Reserve Account, the cash equivalent of their annual level of fixe-d
assets depreciation. PWC has accumulated sizable funds in this account. Since
an undue financial burden would be placed on PWC (and ultimately its consumers)
if both debt service payments and depreciation were to be remitted to the
Government, the Corporation has not met its principal repayment obligations under
subsidiary loan agreements signed between PWC and the Government in connection
with IDA Credits. Recently, however, agreement was reached with the Government
and PWC under the Tarim Water Supply Project (Credit 2170-ROY), to allow PWC to
utilize funds from the Capital Reserve Account to meet its debt service
obligations.
6.06 ORerational Performance. PWC has expanded rapidly over the past several
years through the creation of a new branch at Seiyun and the take-over of
existing water supply facilities in the towns of Abyan, Tor Al Baha and Radfan.
PWC now operates 8 branches in total. Although progress was made in reducing
unaccounted-for-water from 29.4% in 1984 to 24% in 1986, the absorption by PWC
of four existing inefficient municipal water systems was the main cause for an
increase in the level of unaccounted-for-water to 28.4% in 1989. Since 1984,
PWC has increased water production by 27% and the number of connections has risen
by 40%, from 69,700 to 97,680.   The population served by PWC has increased
steadily from about 480,000 in 1984 to about 650,000 inhabitants by the end of
1989. Water bills are issued bi-monthly, and customer accounts receivable have
remained steady at about 4.3 months of sales.   However, the level of inventory
is high and there is a need to improve inventory management and control. Due
in part to the recent take-over of municipal staff, the number of staff employed
by PWC rose dramatically to 1,328 by the end of 1989.  The staffing level is
equivalent to about 13.6 staff per 1,000 connections, which appears high when
compared to a number of about 8 normally found in similar water utilities in
developing countries. It should be noted that this comparison does not take into
account the rugged topography and isolated locations of several of PWC's smaller
branches, or PWC's practice of integrating currently employed staff into its
operations when it takes over existing facilities.
6.07   Imnact of the Project.  The project had a significant impact on Seiyun
and the 39 surrounding villages since it has provided a population of about
60,000 inhabitants with an adequate supply of safe drinking water which was
hitherto not available. The project also helped to raise social and economic
living conditions and had a positive environmental impact through reducing the
health hazards associated with inadequate water for personal hygiene and potable
water of poor quality.   Housing development and the expansion of commercial
activities had also been previously hampered by the unavailability of water.
The project's 8% rate of return was calculated using ir^-emental water sales at
current and projected tariff levels (Part III, Section 6) since quantification
of environmental and health benefits is not possible.
6.08   The project included three studies (Part III, Section 6).  The detailed
designs of the Upper Tuban Wellfield and Transmission Pipeline to Bir Nasr were



7
used as a basis for Credit 1739-YDR.   Similarly, the feasibility study and
detailed designs of the Tarim Water Supply System formed the basis of Credit
2170-YDR. The third study on sanitation in the Seiyun area did not lead to a
follow-up sewerage project because the cost of the proposed conventional sewerage
system was excessive. Under Credit 2170-ROY, it was agreed to undertake a pilot
wartewater demonstration project to assess low-cost technologies for wastewater
disposal that may be replicable on a national basis.
7.    Project Sustainability
7.01  As mentioned in para. 6.07, the project has provided significant benefits
to the population in Seiyun town and in 39 small rural villages through the
provision of safe potable water.   The provision of technical assistance and
training also helped to strengthen PWC's operation and maintenance practices.
The Seiyun branch has been operational for about two years and is staffed in
accordance with an organizational and administrative structure agreed with IDA.
7.02 It is PWC's intention that the Seiyun Branch gradually take on greater
responsibility for the provision of water supply in the outlying smaller rural
villages in the upper Wadi Hadramawt. In addition, the larger towns of Shibam
and Al Qatn will eventually be subsumed by the Seiyun Branch (these 2 towns
currently provide water supply to more than 31,000 inhabitants). The Tarim Water
Supply Project (Credit 2170-ROY) was approved by IDA on June 28, 1990.  The town
of Tarim is located about 25 kilometers from Seiyun. It is also PWC's intention
that Tarim become a sub-branch of the main Seiyun branch.
7.03   The main challenges for PWC in the future will be to continue improving
its managerial and operational efficiency at a time when it is experiencing rapid
growth.   Initiatives are currently under way to: (i) introduce computerized
billing, collection and management information systems; and (ii) carry out a leak
detection and repair program in Greater Aden (Credit 1739-YDR), an operational
efficiency improvement study in A'l Mukalla (Credit 1944-YDR) and an intensive
three-year metering program (Cred-.t 2170-ROY). A financial study is also planned
to review the structure and level, of tariffs. PWC's current financial position
is strong, and it is important fo:: PWC to continue to remain a financially viable
institution.   Emphasis will also need to be placed on training for staff in
technical, operational and managet4al fields.
8.    IDA Performance
8.01   IDA contributed to the success of the project and to the institutional
development of PWC through regular and timely supervision missions and a
constructive dialogue with PWC staff. The staffing and skill mix of IDA missions
were generally appropriate, though subsequent to the Bank's reorganization in
1987, there was a brief lack of continuity of IDA staff working on the project.
9.    Borrower Performance
9.01 PWC's performance was more than satisfactory, particularly given the delays



8
in project implementation which were beyond PWC' s control (para 5.01). However,
there was a hiatus in the preparation of quarterly progress reports during the
1984-86 period, and audit reports were received well after the nine-month
covenanted deadline. The Borrower and PWC were generally in compliance with
Credit and Project Agreement covenants, respectively, though with some delays
(Part III, Section 7).
10.   Lessons Learned
10.01 The principal lessons of experience gained from the project are:
(i)   procurement schedules  should be designed to reflect realistic
timeframes for completing the various procurement procedures. The
prcoject implementation schedule was generally realistic except for
ths time allowed to complete the initial tendering process for
borehole drilling. Moreover, the ceiling for international shopping
of $50,000 was too low and should have been raised to $100,000. This
would have reduced unnecessary procurement delays for smaller items
such as water meters and other operational equipment;
(ii)  although physical implementation of the project was satisfactory,
more attention needs to be paid to utilizing progress reports and
monitoring indicators as a basis for discussion on areas where
managerial and operational efficiency improvements could be made.
For example, the monitoring indicators which were discussed and
agreed between IDA and PWC during negotiations, were not used to
monitor quarterly or annual performance against appraisal targets;
(iii) continued attention should be given to training in water sector
operations and management. The country-wide shortage of qualified
technical staff (engineers and accountants in particular) means that
PWC will need to continue employing consultants to assist in
construction supervision of major capital projects. Project-related
training included under the project was beneficial, but it was
provided on an ad hoe basis. Under Credit 1944-YDR, the design of
a training program in managerial, administrative and operational
fields was undertaken by the World Health Organization. Based on
the conclusions of this study, PWC has prepared a Five-Year Manpower
Development Plan which includes a detailed local and overseas
training program and the proposed establishment of a training center
in operations and maintenance in Seiyun.   In connection with the
Tarim Water Supply Project (Credit 2170-ROY), PWC has agreed to
commence a manpower training program by December 31, 1991; and
(iv)  PWC  should  continue  to  focus  on  improving  operational  and
administrative efficiency through: (a) the reduction of unaccounted-
for-water; and (b) introducing computerized billing, accounting and
management information systems.  Components to carry out a leak
detection and repair program in Greater Aden and to undertake an
operational efficiency improvement study in Al Mukalla have been



9
initiated under Credits 1739-YDR and 1944-YDR, respectively. The
computerization of billing, accounting and financial systems is being
initiated  under  Credit  1944-YDR.       Credit  2170-ROY  includes
components aimed at establishing management information and inventory
control systems and executing a three-year intensive metering
program.
11.   Project Relationshig
11.01   The working relationships and coordination between PWC, Government
officials, IDA and Arab Fund staff ir.volved in project implementation were
fruitful and mutually supportive. It should be noted that the main contract for
civil works, equipment and materials under the project was financed by IDA and
the Arab Fund on a parallel basis and the contract for construction supervision
was financed on a joint basis. These arrangements worked satisfactorily.
12.   Performance of Consultancs and Contractors
12.01   The performance of the consultants for construction supervision was
satisfactory and a good relationship existed between the consultants and PWC.
The performance of the consultants who carried out the three studies financed
under the project was also satisfactory, despite delays in completion of the
studies (para. 6.08 and Part III, Section 6). According to PWC, there were some
difficulties with the contractor who carried out the main civil, electrical and
mechanical works because the contractor did not follow the specified procedures
for submission of details of the electrical and mechanical equipment.   The
quality of construction was also satisfactory, but PWC contends that there was
an eleven month delay in completion of the electrical and mechanical works.
Moreover, the final "as built" record drawings and manuals for the system have
not yet been 3ubmitted to PWC. This led PWC to apply lOX liquidated damages, with
the contractor claiming compensation for delays in completion of works that it
deems were the fault of PWC. This matter is still under discussion between PWC
and the contractor.
13.   Project Documentation and Data
13.01 The data provided in the Staff Appraisal Report, Credit and Project
Agreements was adequate and these documents were useful for IDA and PWC as tools
for monitoring project implementation.   Project files and records kept on
implementation were generally satisfactory.

PART II: ASSESSMENT OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
A.    Adequacy and Accuracy of Factual Information Contained in Part III
The data presented in Part III has been checked and found adequate and
accurate.
B.    Comments on the Analysis Contained in Part I
Based on the discussions held with the Bank mission of February/March 1990
on the draft version of the PCR, and the exchange of views on a number of
matters raised in the report at that stage, a good understanding of the
project implementation and circumstances were achieved, and the final
version of the PCR should reflect almost a joint opinion on the various
matters contained in Part I of the PCR.
C.    Evaluation of Bank's Performance and Lessons Learned
C.1   The frequency of Bank missions was adequate.  Staff changes led to
a longer time being spent cn understanding of circumstances and
procedures rather than on continuity and follow up on various
implementation  problems,  particularly  as  the  missions  were
supervising a number of on-going Bank projects, each one which had
its own problems.
C.2   The  ceiling  of US  $50,000  for  procurement  of materials  and
operational equipment under international shopping procedures proved
to be inadequate. It led to the splitting of packages into smaller
consignments to suit the ceiling, which took too much time, and the
end result was that some of the consignments were not financed from
the Credit though they had been ordered and funds committed before
the closing date.  We believe it would have been better if the Bank
had reconsidered the ceiling and increased it to say US $150,000.
We hope this will be considered in the new projects.
D.    Evaluation of the Borrower's Own Performance and Lessons Learned
D.1   The performance of the Public Water Corporation in overall project
planning and implementation was good.  Despite the financial gap
caused by the appreciation of the Deutsche Mark against the US Dollar
and Kuwaiti Dinar which led to a shortfall in the financing of the
secondary  distribution  network,  the Borrower has  successfully
completed this part of the project in time, and made the necessary
funds available from its own resources for the purchase of necessary
materials for the secondary network.
D.2   Except for the financial gap, the project presented no major problems
to the Borrower. The financial gap necessitated some changes to be
made to project components by deleting some items, which did not have
adverse effects on the project objectives.   The gap was being
carefully watched and the right measures were taken at the right time



12
to avoid unforeseen problems.
D.3   Some of the staff needed for the PIU were appointed later than
scheduled.  The training component needed to be more specific to
facilitate implementation of the training programs.
E.    Effectiveness of the RelationshiR Between the Bank and Borrower
The relationship between the Bank and the Borrower was good and effective.
F.    Performance of Co-financier and the Effectiveness of their Relationship
with the Borrower
The relationship between the co-financier and the Borrower was good. The
joint financing of contract No. 2 (consultants for construction
supervision) between the Arab Fund and IDA was successful and presented
no difficulties.

Comments
The principal issue raised at the Issues Paper and Decision Meeting was the shortfall
in financing for the proposed project.  A phased approach was adopted to allow for co-
financing of the second stage, without jeopardizing the integrity of the first phase of the
project which was technically viable on its own. The only other significant variance in the
project processing cycle was the slippage of the Board date by about five months because
the Government was not current in its debt reporting requirements to IDA.
The major construction works were completed by August 31, 1988 although phased water
production began in February 1988. The maintenance period continued through August 31, 1989,
but was extended to March 31, 1990 since there were some works still outstanding. At the
end of 1989, PWC had connected 9,221 customers, of which 6,914 have been metered. Due to
the lack of funds under the project to purchase additional meters, the metering program is
expected to be completed by the end of 1990.

1/  Actual expenditures are less than actual costs since liquidated damages of 10X have been deducted from the main
civil, electrical and mechanical works contract. This claim is pending the outcome of discussions with .he contractor,
who has also subinitted a counter claim for compensation against PWC. The total impact on actual projec: costs
costs couLd amcunt to an increase in project costs of about YD 0.5-1.0 miltion (USS1.5-3.0 million equivalent).
Variances Between Appraisal Estimates and Actual Project Costs
.... .......... .....................................................
The main reasons for variances between actual costs and appraisal estimates of the borefield equipment & pfpeline, chlorination
& generater building, reservoirs, system storage & pumping stations were due to low appraisal estimates erJ the increased cost
of the main civil works contract because of foreign exchange fluctuations. In addition, an emrerency genwrator building, not
envisaged at appraisal, was added to the project. Actual primary distribution costs were lower than envisaged due to a design
improvement. Secondary distribution system costs were greater than envisaged since more consumers were connected than planned.
The Arab Fund financed construction of the head office and warehouse, plus a workshop which was not envisaged at appraisal.

Comments
The Seiyun Branch has been operational for about two years. At present,
unmetered connections, or about 25% of Seiyun's customers, are charged flat fees
for the water used per person. When a connection is metered, PWC's tariffs for
the Wadi Hadramawt region are immediately levied and the normal meter rental fee
is billed per customer. The full impact of revenues from Seiyun Branch on PWC's
financial situation will not be known until all connections have been metered,
which is anticipated by December 1990.
B. Rate of Return
Since the quantification of environmental and health benefits is not
possible, tariffs were used as a proxy for the minimum measure of economic
benefits. The rate of return of 8X (versus the appraisal estimate of 10) was
calculated using incremental water sales at current and projected tariff levels
over  the estimated  life of  the project.    Costs  include project capital
expenditures, replacement costs for mechanical and electrical equipment and
incremental operating costs. The calculations show that the long-run average
incremental cost of water in Seiyun at a discount rate of 10 is estimated at
492 fils per m3, as compared to the appraisal estimate of 400 fils per e3.  The
progressive tariff structure in Seiyun is adequate given that the highest step
tariff is higher than the average incremental cost of water.
The actual financial rate of return of 8% is lower than appraisal estimates
because: (i) of delays in project completion, particularly the metered connection
of all consumers; (ii) the level of tariffs which is lower than envisaged at
appraisal; and (iii) an annual average increase in PWC's wages and salaries of
about 30% in accordance with the civil servant salary increases effective March
1, 1990, which was not envisaged at appraisal.

Comments on Study Component:
The quality of the reports was good, but they took much longer than expected to
complete for the reasons elaborated upon below.
The scope of the study for the Upper Tuban Wellfield and Transmission Pipeline was
expanded mid-stream, and an extension was granted for its completion.   The report was
finalized in October 1986.
The Tarim Water Supply study commenced about one year late, in June 1985, and was
completed in June 1988.  The study was delayed to await the results of the exploratory
borehole drilling and a decision to include the 1988 census data.
The Seiyun Sewerage Scheme was completed by the end of 1989. The main reasons for
delay were that the consultants gave more emphasis to physical works implementation under
the Seiyun project, and according to PWC, the firm was also overextended in the
implementation of other projects in the country.
